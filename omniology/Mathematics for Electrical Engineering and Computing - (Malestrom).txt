Preface
Thisbookisbasedonmynotesfromlecturestostudentsofelectrical, elec-
tronic, and computer engineering at South Bank University. It presents
a ﬁrst year degree/diploma course in engineering mathematics with an
emphasis on important concepts, such as algebraic structure, symme-
tries, linearity, and inverse problems, clearly presented in an accessible
style. It encompasses the requirements, not only of students with a good
maths grounding, but also of those who, with enthusiasm and motiva-
tion, can make up the necessary knowledge. Engineering applications
are integrated at each opportunity. Situations where a computer should
be used to perform calculations are indicated and ‘hand’ calculations
are encouraged only in order to illustrate methods and important special
cases. Algorithmic procedures are discussed with reference to their efﬁ-
ciency and convergence, with a presentation appropriate to someone new
to computational methods.
Developments in the ﬁelds of engineering, particularly the extensive
use of computers and microprocessors, have changed the necessary sub-
ject emphasis within mathematics. This has meant incorporating areas
such as Boolean algebra, graph and language theory, and logic into
the content. A particular area of interest is digital signal processing,
with applications as diverse as medical, control and structural engineer-
ing, non-destructive testing, and geophysics. An important consideration
when writing this book was to give more prominence to the treatment
of discrete functions (sequences), solutions of difference equations and z
transforms, and also to contextualize the mathematics within a systems
approach to engineering problems.

I should like to thank my former colleagues in the School of
Electrical,
Electronic and Computer Engineering at South Bank
University who supported and encouraged me with my attempts to
re-think approaches to the teaching of engineering mathematics.
I should like to thank all the reviewers for their comments and the
editorial and production staff at Elsevier Science.
Many friends have helped out along the way, by discussing ideas or
reading chapters. Above all Gabrielle Sinnadurai who checked the orig-
inal manuscript of Engineering Mathematics Exposed, wrote the major
part of the solutions manual and came to the rescue again by reading
some of the new material in this publication. My partner Michael has
given unstinting support throughout and without him I would never have
found the energy.

Sets and functions
1.1 Introduction
Finding relationships between quantities is of central importance in
engineering. For instance, we know that given a simple circuit with a
1000  resistance then the relationship between current and voltage is
given by Ohm’s law, I = V /1000. For any value of the voltage V we can
give an associated value of I. This relationship means that I is a function
of V . From this simple idea there are many other questions that need
clarifying, some of which are:
1.
Are all values of V permitted? For instance, a very high value of the
voltage could change the nature of the material in the resistor and the
expression would no longer hold.
2.
Supposing the voltage V is the equivalent voltage found from con-
sidering a larger network. Then V is itself a function of other voltage
values in the network (see Figure 1.1). How can we combine the func-
tions to get the relationship between this current we are interested in
and the actual voltages in the network?
3.
Supposing we know the voltage in the circuit and would like to know
the associated current. Given the function that deﬁnes how current
depends on the voltage can we ﬁnd a function that deﬁnes how the
voltage depends on the current? In the case where I = V /1000, it is
clear that V = 1000I. This is called the inverse function.
Another reason exists for better understanding of the nature of func-
tions. In Chapters 5 and 6, we shall study differentiation and integration.
This looks at the way that functions change. A good understanding of
functions and how to combine them will help considerably in those
chapters.
The values that are permitted as inputs to a function are grouped
together. A collection of objects is called a set. The idea of a set is very
simple, but studying sets can help not only in understanding functions
but also help to understand the properties of logic circuits, as discussed
in Chapter 10.
Figure 1.1
The voltage V is
an equivalent voltage found
by considering the combined
effect of circuit elements in
the rest of the network.

Sets and functions
1.2 Sets
A set is a collection of objects, called elements, in which the order is not
important and an object cannot appear twice in the same set.
Example 1.1
Explicit deﬁnitions of sets, that is, where each element is
listed, are:
A = {a, b, c}
B = {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
C = {Linda, Raka, Sue, Joe, Nigel, Mary}
a ∈A means ‘a is an element of A’ or ‘a belongs to A’; therefore in the
above examples:
3 ∈B
Linda ∈C
The universal set is the set of all objects we are interested in and will
depend on the problem under consideration. It is represented by E.
The empty set (or null set) is the set with no elements. It is represented
by ∅or { }.
Sets can be represented diagrammatically – generally as circular
shapes. The universal set is represented as a rectangle. These are called
Venn diagrams.
Example 1.2
E = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g},
A = {a, b, c},
B = {d, e}
This can be shown as in Figure 1.2.
Figure 1.2
A Venn diagram
of the sets E =
{a, b, c, d, e, f, g}, A = {a, b, c},
and B = {d, e}.
We shall mainly be concerned with sets of numbers as these are more
often used as inputs to functions.
Some important sets of numbers are (where ‘. . .’ means continue in
the same manner):
The set of natural numbers N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .}
The set of integers Z = {. . . −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3 . . .}
The set of rationals (which includes fractional numbers) Q
The set of reals (all the numbers necessary to represent points on a
line) R
Sets can also be deﬁned using some rule, instead of explicitly.
Example 1.3
Deﬁne the set A explicitly where E
=
N and
A = {x | x < 3}.
Solution
The A = {x | x < 3} is read as ‘A is the set of elements x, such
that x is less than 3’. Therefore, as the universal set is the set of natural
numbers, A = {1, 2}
Example 1.4
E
= days of the week and A
=
{x | x is after
Thursday and before Sunday}. Then A = {Friday, Saturday}.
TLFeBOOK

Sets and functions

Subsets
We may wish to refer to only a part of some set. This is said to be a subset
of the original set.
A ⊆B is read as ‘A is a subset of B’ and it means that every element
of A is an element of B.
Example 1.5
E = N
A = {1, 2, 3},
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Then A ⊆B
Note the following points:
All sets must be subsets of the universal set, that is, A ⊆E and
B ⊆E
A set is a subset of itself, that is, A ⊆A
If A ⊆B and B ⊆A, then A = B
Proper subsets
A ⊂B is read as ‘A is a proper subset of B’ and means that A is a subset
of B but A is not equal to B. Hence, A ⊂B and simultaneously B ⊂A
are impossible.
Figure 1.3
A Venn diagram
of a proper subset of B:
A ⊂B.
A proper subset can be shown on a Venn diagram as in Figure 1.3.
1.3 Operations
on sets
In Chapter 1 of the background Mathematics notes available on the com-
panion website for this book, we study the rules obeyed by numbers
when using operations like negation, multiplication, and addition. Sets
can be combined in various ways using set operations. Sets and their
operations form a Boolean Algebra which we look at in greater detail
in Chapter 4, particularly its application to digital design. The most
important set operations are as given in this section.
Complement
¯A or A′ represents the complement of the set A. The complement of A is
the set of everything in the universal set which is not in A, this is pictured
in Figure 1.4.
Figure 1.4
The shaded area
is the complement, A′, of the
set A.
Example 1.6
E = N
A = {x | x > 5}
then A′ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Figure 1.9
The
intersection of the
two sets:
{−3, −2, −1} ∩
{1, 2} = ∅, the empty
set, as they have no
elements in common.
Example 1.7
The universal set is the set of real numbers represented
by a real number line.
If A is the set of numbers less than 5, A = {x | x < 5} then A′ is the
set of numbers greater than or equal to 5. A′ = {x | x ⩾5}. These sets
are shown in Figure 1.5.
Intersection
A ∩B represents the intersection of the sets A and B. The intersection
contains those elements that are in A and also in B, this can be represented
as in Figure 1.6 and examples are given in Figures 1.7–1.10.
Note the following important points:
If A ⊆B then A∩B = A. This is the situation in the example given
in Figure 1.8.
If A and B have no elements in common then A ∩B = ∅and they
are called disjoint. This is the situation given in the example in
Figure 1.9. Two sets which are known to be disjoint can be shown
on the Venn diagram as in Figure 1.10.
Figure 1.10
Disjoint sets A
and B.
Union
A∪B represents the union of A and B, that is, the set containing elements
which are in A or B or in both A and B. On a Venn diagram, the union can
be shown as in Figure 1.11 and examples are given in Figures 1.12–1.15.
Note the following important points:
If A ⊆B, then A ∪B = B. This is the situation in the example
given in Figure 1.13.
The union of any set with its complement gives the universal set, that
is, A ∪A′ = E, the universal set. This is pictured in Figure 1.15.

The shaded
area represents the union of a

Cardinality of a ﬁnite set
The number of elements in a set is called the cardinality of the set and is
written as n(A) or |A|.
Example 1.8
n(∅) = 0,
n({2}) = 1,
n({a, b}) = 2
For ﬁnite sets, the cardinality must be a natural number.
Example 1.9
In a survey, 100 people were students and 720 owned a
video recorder; 794 people owned a video recorder or were students. How
many students owned a video recorder?
E = {x | x is a person included in the survey}
Setting S = {x | x is a student} and V = {x | x owns a video recorder},
we can solve this problem using a Venn diagram as in Figure 1.16.
Figure 1.16
S is the set of
students in a survey and V is
the set of people who own a
video. The numbers in the
sets give the cardinality of the
sets, n(S) = 100, n(S ∪V) =
794, n(V) = 720,
n(S ∩V) = x.
x isthenumberofstudentswhoownavideorecorder. Fromthediagram
we get
100 −x + x + 720 −x = 794

1.4 Relations
and functions
Relations
A relation is a way of pairing up members of two sets. This is just like
the idea of family relations. For instance, a child can be paired with its
mother, brothers can be paired with sisters, etc. A relation is such that it
may not always be possible to ﬁnd a suitable partner for each element in
the ﬁrst set whereas sometimes there will be more than one. For instance,
if we try to pair every boy with his sister there will be some boys who have
no sisters and some boys who have several. This is pictured in Figure 1.17.

have more than one sister
and some have none at all.
Functions
Functions are relations where the pairing is always possible. Functions
are like mathematical machines. For each input value there is always
exactly one output value.
Figure 1.18
An arrow
diagram of the function
y = 1/x.
Calculators output function values. For instance, input 2 into a cal-
culator, press 1/x and the calculator will display the number 0.5. The
output value is called the image of the input value. The set of input values
is called the domain and the set containing all the images is called the
codomain.
The function y = 1/x is displayed in Figure 1.18 using arrows to link
input values with output values.
Functions can be represented by letters. If the function of the above
example is given the letter f to represent it then we can write
f : x →1
x
This can be read as ‘f is the function which when input a value for x gives
the output value 1/x’ . Another way of giving the same information is:
f (x) = 1
x
f (x) represents the image of x under the function f and is read as ‘f of x’.
It does not mean the same as f times x.
f (x) = 1/x means ‘the image of x under the function f is given by
1/x’ but is usually read as ‘f of x equals 1/x’.
Even more simply, we usually use the letter y to represent the output
value, the image, and x to represent the input value. The function is
therefore summed up by y = 1/x.
x is a variable because it can take any value from the set of values in
the domain. y is also a variable but its value is ﬁxed once x is known.
So x is called the independent variable and y is called the dependent
variable.
The letters used to deﬁne a function are not important. y = 1/x is the
same as z = 1/t is the same as p = 1/q provided that the same input
values (for x, t, or q) are allowed in each case.
More examples of functions are given in arrow diagrams in
Figures 1.19(a) and 1.20(a). Functions are more usually drawn using
a graph, rather than by using an arrow diagram. To get the graph the
codomain is moved to be at right angles to the domain and input and
output values are marked by a point at the position (x, y). Graphs are
given in Figures 1.19(b) and 1.20(b).

Continuous functions and discrete
functions applied to signals
Functions of particular interest to engineers are either functions of a real
number or functions of an integer. The function given in Figure 1.19 is
an example of a real function and the function given in Figure 1.20 is an
example of a function of an integer, also called a discrete function.
Often, we are concerned with functions of time. A variable voltage
source can be described by giving the voltage as it depends on time, as also
can the current. Other examples are: the position of a moving robot arm,
the extension or compression of car shock absorbers and the heat emission
of a thermostatically controlled heating system. A voltage or current
varying with time can be used to control instrumentation or to convey
information. For this reason it is called a signal. Telecommunication
signals may be radio waves or voltages along a transmission line or light
signals along an optical ﬁbre.
Time, t, can be represented by a real number, usually non-negative.
Time is usually taken to be positive because it is measured from some
reference instant, for example, when a circuit switch is closed. If time is
used to describe relative events then it can make sense to refer to negative
time. If lightning is seen 1 s before a thunderclap is heard then this can
be described by saying the lightning happened at −1 s or alternatively
that the thunderclap was heard at 1 s. In the two cases, the time origin
has been chosen differently. If time is taken to be continuous and rep-
resented by a real variable then functions of time will be continuous or
piecewise continuous. Examples of graphs of such functions are given in
Figure 1.21.

Continuous and piecewise functions where time is represented by a real number > 0. (a) A
ramp function; (b) a wave (c) a square wave. (a) and (b) are continuous, while (c) is piecewise continuous.
A continuous function is one whose graph can be drawn without taking
your pen off the paper. A piecewise continuous function has continuous
bits with a limited number of jumps. In Figure 1.21, (a) and (b) are
continuous functions and (c) is a piecewise continuous function. If we
have a digital signal, then its values are only known at discrete moments
of time. Digital signals can be obtained by using an analog to digital
(A/D) convertor on an originally continuous signal. Digital signals are
represented by discrete functions as in Figure 1.22(a)–(c)
A digital signal has a sampling interval, T , which is the length of
time between successive values. A digital functions is represented by a
discrete function. For example, in Figure 1.22(a) the digital ramp can be
represented by the numbers
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .
If the sample interval T is different from 1 then the values would be
0, T, 2T, 3T, 4T, 5T, . . .
This is a discrete function also called a sequence. It can be represented
by the expression f (t) = t, where t = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . or using the
sampling interval, T , g(n) = nT , where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . .
Yet another common way of representing a sequence is by using a
subscript on the letter representing the image, giving
fn = n, where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .
or, using the letter a for the image values,
an = n, where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .
Substituting some values for n into the above gives
a0 = 0, a1 = 1, a2 = 2, a3 = 3, . . .
As a sequence is a function of the natural numbers and zero (or if
negative input values are allowed, the integers) there is no need to specify

the input values and it is possible merely to list the output values in order.
Hence the ramp function can be expressed by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . .
Time sequences are often referred to as ‘series’. This terminology is
not usual in mathematics books, however, as the description ‘series’ is
reserved for describing the sum of a sequence. Sequences and series are
dealt with in more detail in Chapter 18.

Undeﬁned function values
Some functions have ‘undeﬁned values’, that is, numbers that cannot be
input into them successfully. For instance input 0 on a calculator and
try getting the value of 1/x. The calculator complains (usually display-
ing ‘-E-’) indicating that an error has occurred. The reason that this is an
error is that we are trying to ﬁnd the value of 1/0 that is 1 divided by 0.
Look at Chapter 1 of the Background Mathematics Notes, given on the
accompanying website for this book, for a discussion about why division
by 0 is not deﬁned. The number 0 cannot be included in the domain of
the function f (x) = 1/x. This can be expressed by saying
f (x) = 1/x,
where x ∈R and x ̸= 0
which is read as ‘f of x equals 1/x, where x is a real number not equal
to 0’.

Often, we assume that we are considering functions of a real variable
and only need to indicate the values that are not allowed as inputs for the
function. So we may write
f (x) = 1/x
where x ̸= 0
Things to look out for as values that are not allowed as function
inputs are :
1.
Numbers that would lead to an attempt to divide by zero
2.
Numbers that would lead to negative square roots
3.
Numbers that would lead to negative inputs to a logarithm.
Examples 1.12(a) and (b) require solutions to inequalities which we
shall discuss in greater detail in Chapter 2. Here, we shall only look at
simple examples and use the same rules as used for solving equations. We
can ﬁnd equivalent inequalities by doing the same thing to both sides, with
the extra rule that, for the moment, we avoid multiplication or division
by a negative number.
Example 1.12
Find the values that cannot be input to the following
functions, where the independent variable (x or r) is real:
(a)
y = 3
√
x −2 + 5
(b)
y = 3 log10(2 −4x)
(c)
R =
r + 1000
1000(r −2)
Solution
(a) y = 3
√
x −2 + 5
Here x −2 cannot be negative as we need to take the square root of it.
x −2 ⩾0 ⇔x ⩾2
therefore, the function is
y = 3
√
x −2 + 5
where x ⩾2
(b) y = 3 log10(2 −4x).
Here 2−4x cannot be 0 or negative else we could not take the logarithm.
2 −4x > 0
⇔
2 > 4x
⇔
2/4 > x
or equivalently, x < 1
2. So the function is
y = 3 log10(2 −4x)
where x < 0.5

r + 1000
1000(r −2)

Here 1000(r −2) cannot be 0, else we would be trying to divide by 0.

r = 2
The function is
R =
r + 1000
1000(r −2)
where r ̸= 2

(b)

Solve for (k −3)(k −2.2) = 0 giving k = 3 or k = 2.2. As 2.2 is not an
integer then there is not need to speciﬁcally exclude it from the function
input values, so the function is

(k −3)(k −2.2)

Example 1.14
Find a table of values for the function deﬁned by the
recurrence relation:
f (n) = f (n −1) + 2
(1.1)
where f (0) = 0.
Solution
Assuming that the function is deﬁned for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . then
we can take successive values of n and ﬁnd the values taken by the
function. n = 0 gives f (0) = 0 as given.
Substituting n = 1 into Equation (1.1) gives
f (1) = f (1 −1) + 2
⇔
f (1) = f (0) + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2 (using f (0) = 0)
hence, f (1) = 2.
Substituting n = 2 into Equation (1.1) gives
f (2) = f (2 −1) + 2
⇔f (2) = f (1) + 2
⇔f (2) = f (1) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 (using f (1) = 2)
hence, f (2) = 4.
Substituting n = 3 into Equation (1.1) gives
f (3) = f (3 −1) + 2
⇔f (3) = f (2) + 2 = 4 + 2 (using f (2) = 4)
hence, f (3) = 6.
Continuing in the same manner gives the following table:

1.5 Combining
functions
The sum, difference, product, and
quotient of two functions, f and g
Two functions with R as their domain and codomain can be combined
using arithmetic operations. We can deﬁne the sum of f and g by
(f + g) : x →f (x) + g(x)
The other operations are deﬁned as follows:
(f −g) : x →f (x) −g(x)
difference,
(f × g) : x →f (x) × g(x)
product,
(f /g) : x →f (x)
g(x)
quotient.
TLFeBOOK

Sets and functions
Example 1.15
Find the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the
functions:
f : x →x2 and g : x →x6
Solution
(f + g) : x →x2 + x6
(f −g) : x →x2 −x6
(f × g) : x →x2 × x6 = x8
(f /g) : x →x2
x6 = x−4
The speciﬁcation of the domain of the quotient is not straightforward.
This is because of the difﬁculty which occurs when g(x) = 0. When
g(x) = 0 the quotient function is undeﬁned and we must remove such
elements from its domain. The domain of f /g is R with the values where
g(x) = 0 omitted.
Composition of functions
This method of combining functions is fundamentally different from the
arithmetical combinations of the previous section. The composition of
two functions is the action of performing one function followed by the
other, that is, a function of a function.
Figure 1.25
The function
a : kilograms →money used
in Example 1.16.
Example 1.16
A post ofﬁce worker has a scale expressed in kilograms
which gives the cost of a parcel depending on its weight. He also has an
approximate formula for conversion from pounds (lbs) to kilograms. He
wishes to ﬁnd out the cost of a parcel which weighs 3 lb.
The two functions involved are:
a : kilograms →money and c : lbs →kilograms
a is deﬁned by Figure 1.25 and the function c is given by
c : x →x/2.2
Solution
The composition ‘a ◦c’ will be a function from lbs to money.
Hence, 3 lb after the function c gives 1.364 and 1.364 after the function
a gives e1.90 and therefore
(a ◦c)(3) = e1.90.
Example 1.17
Supposing f (x) = 2x + 1 and g(x) = x2, then we can
combine the functions in two ways.

g, that is, g ◦f . To describe this function, we want to ﬁnd what happens

to x under the function g ◦f . Another way of saying that is we need to
ﬁnd g(f (x)). To do this call f (x) a new letter, say y.
y = f (x) = 2x + 1
Rewrite g as a function of y
g(y) = y2
Now substitute y = 2x + 1 giving
g(2x + 1) = (2x + 1)2
Hence,
g(f (x)) = (2x + 1)2
(g ◦f )(x) = (2x + 1)2.
2. A composite function can be formed by performing g ﬁrst and then
f , that is, f ◦g. To describe this function, we want to ﬁnd what happens
to x under the function f ◦g. Another way of saying that is we need to
ﬁnd f (g(x)). To do this call g(x) a new letter, say y.
y = g(x) = x2
Rewrite f as a function of y
f (y) = 2y + 1
Now substitute y = x2 giving
f (x2) = 2x2 + 1
Hence,
f (g(x)) = 2x2 + 1
(f ◦g)(x) = 2x2 + 1.
Example 1.18
Supposing u(t) = 1/(t −2) and v(t) = 3 −t then,
again, we can combine the functions in two ways.
1. A composite function can be formed by performing u ﬁrst and then
v, that is, v ◦u. To describe this function, we want to ﬁnd what happens
to t under the function v ◦u. Another way of saying that is we need to
ﬁnd v(u(t)). To do this call u(t) a new letter, say y.

2. A composite function can be formed by performing v ﬁrst and then
u, that is u ◦v. To describe this function, we want to ﬁnd what happens

ﬁnd u(v(t)). To ﬁnd this call v(t) a new letter, say y.
y = v(t) = 3 −t

Decomposing functions
In order to calculate the value of a function, either by hand or using a
calculator, we need to understand how it decomposes. That is we need to
understand to order of the operations in the function expression
TLFeBOOK

Sets and functions
21
Example 1.19
Calculate y = (2x + 1)3 when x = 2
Solution
RemembertheorderofoperationsdiscussedinChapter1ofthe
Background Mathematics booklet available on the companion website.
The operations are performed in the following order:
Start with x = 2 then
2x = 4
2x + 1 = 5
(2x + 1)3 = 125
So, there are three operations involved
1.
multiply by 2,
2.
add on 1,
3.
take the cube.
This way of breaking down functions can be pictured using boxes
to represent each operation that makes up the function, as was used to
represent equations in Chapter 3 of the Background Mathematics booklet
available on the companion website. The whole function can be thought
of as a machine, represented by a box. For each value x, from the domain
of the function that enters the machine, there is a resulting image, y,
which comes out of it. This is pictured in Figure 1.26.

x represents the input value,

Inside of the box, we can write the name of the functions or the expres-
sion which gives the function rule. A composite function box can be

y = (2x + 1)3 breaks down as in Figure 1.27.

The inverse of a function
The inverse of a function is a function which will take the image under
the function back to its original value. If f −1(x) is the inverse of f (x)
then
f −1(f (x)) = x

To show this is true, look at the combined function f −1(f (x)) =

Finding the inverse of a linear function
One simple way of ﬁnding the inverse of a linear function is to:
1.
Decompose the operations of the function.
2.
Combine the inverse operations (performed in the reverse order) to
give the inverse function.
This is a method similar to that used to solve linear equations in
Chapter 3 of the Background Mathematics Notes available on the
companion website for this book.

represents the function
f (x) = 5x −2 (read from left
to right) and the bottom line

Example 1.21
Find the inverse of the function f (x) = 5x −2.
The method of solution is given in Figure 1.29.
The inverse operations give that x = (y + 2)/5. Here y is the input
value into the inverse function and x is the output value. To use x and y
in the more usual way, where x is the input and y the output, swap the
letters giving the inverse function as
y = x + 2
5
This result can be achieved more quickly by rearranging the expression
so that x is the subject of the formula and then swap x and y.
Example 1.22
Find the inverse of f (x) = 5x −2.
y = 5x −2
⇔
y + 2 = 5x
⇔
y + 2
5
= x
⇔
x = y + 2
5
Now swap x and y to give y = (x + 2)/5. Therefore,
f −1(x) = (x + 2)/5.

The function followed by its inverse has given us the original value of x.
The range of a function
When combining functions, for example, f (g(x)), we have to ensure that
g(x) will only output values that are allowed to be input to f . The set of
images of g(x) becomes an important consideration. The set of images
of a function is called its range. The range of a function is a subset of its
codomain.
1.6 Summary
1.
Functions are used to express relationships between physical
quantities.
2.
The allowed inputs to a function are grouped into a set, called the
domain of the function. The set including all the outputs is called
the codomain.
3.
A set is a collection of objects called elements.
TLFeBOOK

Sets and functions
4.
E is the universal set, the set of all objects we are interested in.
5.
∅is the empty set, the set with no elements.
6.
The three most important operations on sets are:
(a)
intersection: A ∩B is the set containing every element in both
A and B;
(b)
union: A ∪B is the set of elements in A or in B or both;
(c)
complement: A′ is the set of everything, in the universal set,
not in A.
7.
A relation is a way of pairing members of two sets.
8.
Functions are a special type of relation which can be thought of as
mathematical machines. For each input value there is exactly one
output value.
9.
Many functions of interest are functions of time, used to represent
signals. Analogue signals can be represented by functions of a real
variable and digital signals by functions of an integer (discrete func-
tions). Functions of an integer are also called sequences and can be
deﬁned using a recurrence relation.
10.
To ﬁnd the domain of a real or discrete function exclude values that
could lead to a division by zero, negative square roots, or negative
logarithms or other undeﬁned values.
11.
Functions can be combined in various ways including sum, dif-
ference, product, and quotient. A special operation of functions is
composition. A composite function is found by performing a second
function on the result of the ﬁrst.
12.
The inverse of a function is a function which will take the image
under the function back to its original value.

Functions and
their graphs
2.1 Introduction
The ability to produce a picture of a problem is an important step towards
solving it. From the graph of a function, y = f (x), we are able to predict
such things as the number of solutions to the equation f (x) = 0, regions
over which it is increasing or decreasing, and the points where it is not
deﬁned.
Recognizing the shape of functions is an important and useful skill.
Oscilloscopes give a graphical representation of voltage against time,
from which we may be able to predict an expression for the voltage. The
increasing use of signal processing means that many problems involve
analysing how functions of time are effected by passing through some
mechanical or electrical system.
In order to draw graphs of a large number of functions, we need only
remember a few key graphs and appreciate simple ideas about transforma-
tions. A sketch of a graph is one which is not necessarily drawn strictly
to scale but shows its important features. We shall start by looking at
special properties of the straight line (linear function) and the quadratic.
Then we look at the graphs of y = x, y = x2, y = 1/x, y = ax and how
to transform these graphs to get graphs of functions like y = 4x −2,
y = (x −2)2, y = 3/x, and y = a−x.
2.2 The straight
line: y = mx + c
y = mx + c is called a linear function because its graph is a straight
line. Notice that there are only two terms in the function; the x term, mx,
where m is called the coefﬁcient of x and c which is the constant term. m
and c have special signiﬁcance. m is the gradient, or the slope, of the line
and c is the value of y when x = 0, that is, when the graph crosses the
y-axis. This graph is shown in Figure 2.1(a) and two particular examples
shown in Figure 2.1(b) and (c).
Figure 2.1
(a) The graph of the function y = mx + c. m is the slope of the line, if m is positive then travelling
from left to right along the line of the function is an uphill climb, if m is negative then the journey is downhill.
The constant c is where the graph crosses the y-axis. (b) m = 2 and c = 3 (c) m = −1 and c = 2.

27
The gradient of a straight line
The gradient gives an idea of how steep the climb is as we travel along the
line of the graph. If the gradient is positive then we are travelling uphill
as we move from left to right and if the gradient is negative then we are
travelling downhill. If the gradient is zero then we are on ﬂat ground. The
gradient gives the amount that y increases when x increases by 1 unit. A
straight line always has the same slope at whatever point it is measured.
To show that in the expression y = mx + c, m is the gradient, we begin
with a couple of examples as in Figure 2.1(b) and (c)
In Figure 2.1(b), we have the graph of y = 2x + 3. Take any two
values of x which differ by 1 unit, for example, x = 0 and x = 1. When
x = 0, y = 2×0 + 3 = 3 and when x = 1, y = 2×1 + 3 = 5. The
increase in y is 5 −3 = 2, and this is the same as the coefﬁcient of x in
the function expression.
In Figure 2.1(c), we see the graph of y = −x + 2. Take any two
values of x which differ by 1 unit, for example, x = 1 and x = 2. When
x = 1, y = −(1) + 2 = 1 and when x = 2, y = −(2) + 2 = 0. The
increase in y is 0 −1 = −1 and this is the same as the coefﬁcient of x in
the function expression.
In the general case, y = mx + c, take any two values of x which differ
by 1 unit, for example, x = x0 and x = x0+1. When x = x0, y = mx0+c
and when x = x0 + 1, y = m(x + 1) + c = mx + m + c. The increase
in y is mx + m + c −(mx + c) = m.
We know that every time x increases by 1 unit y increases by m.
However, we do not need to always consider an increase of exactly 1 unit
in x. The gradient gives the ratio of the increase in y to the increase in x.
Therefore, if we only have a graph and we need to ﬁnd the gradient then
we can use any two points that lie on the line.
To ﬁnd the gradient of the line take any two points on the line (x1, y1)
and (x2, y2).
The gradient = change in y
change in x = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
Example 2.1
Find the gradient of the lines given in Figure 2.2(a)–(c)
and the equation for the line in each case.
Solution
(a)
We are given the coordinates of two points that lie on the straight
line in Figure 2.2(a) as (0,3) and (2,5),
gradient = change in y
change in x = 5 −3
2 −0 = 2
2 = 1.
To ﬁnd the constant term in the expression y = mx + c, we ﬁnd
the value of y when the line crosses the y-axis. From the graph this
is 3, so the equation is y = mx + c where m = 1 and c = 3, giving
y = x + 3
(b)
Two points that lie on the line in Figure 2.2(b) are (−1, −3) and
(−2, −6). These are found by measuring the x and y values for
some points on the line.
gradient = change in y
change in x = −6 −(−3)
−2 −(−1) = −3
−1 = 3.
To ﬁnd the constant term in the expression y = mx + c, we ﬁnd
the value of y when the line crosses the y-axis. From the graph this

is 0, so the equation is y = mx + c where m = 3 and c = 0 giving
y = 3x
(c)
Two points that lie on the line in Figure 2.2(c) are (0,2) and (3,3.5).
gradient = change in y
change in x = 3.5 −2
3 −0 = 1.5
3 = 0.5
To ﬁnd the constant term in the expression y = mx + c, we ﬁnd the
value of y when the line crosses the y-axis. From the graph this is
2, so the equation is y = mx + c where m = 0.5 and c = 2 giving
y = 0.5x + 2
Finding the gradient from the
equation for the line
To ﬁnd the gradient from the equation of the line we look for the value
of m, the number multiplying x in the equation. The constant term gives
the value of y when the graph crosses the y-axis, that is, when x = 0.
Example 2.2
Find the gradient and the value of y when x = 0 for the
following lines:

y = 2x + 3,

29
Solution
(a)
In the equation y = 2x + 3, the value of m, the gradient, is 2 as this
is the coefﬁcient of x. c = 3 which is the value of y when the graph
crosses the y-axis, that is, when x = 0.
(b)
In the equation 3x −4y = 2, we rewrite the equation with y as the
subject of the formula in order to ﬁnd the value of m and c.
3x −4y = 2
⇔
3x = 2 + 4y
⇔
3x −2 = 4y
⇔

4 = y
⇔

We can see, by comparing the expression with y = mx + c, that m,
the gradient, is 3/4 and c = −1/2.
(c)
Write y as the subject of the formula:
x −2y = 4
⇔
x = 4 + 2y
⇔
x −4 = 2y
⇔
2y = x −4
⇔
y = x
2 −2
We can see, by comparing the expression with y = mx + c, that m,
the gradient, is 1/2 and c = −2.

We can see, by comparing the expression with y = mx + c, that m,

Finding the equation of a line which
goes through two points
Supposing we have been given two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), which
lie on a line and we want to ﬁnd the equation of that line. We already
found that the gradient of the line is given by:
The gradient = change in y
change in x = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
We know that the equation of a line is of the form y = mx + c, but we
would like to express the equation just in terms of the two variables, x

Example 2.4
(a)
Sketch the graph of y = 4x −2.
To ﬁnd where the graph crosses the y-axis, substitute x = 0 into
the equation of the line:
y = 4(0) −2 = −2.
This means that the graph passes through the point (0,−2).
To ﬁnd where the graph crosses the x-axis, substitute y = 0,
that is,
4x −2 = 0
⇔
4x = 2
⇔
x = 2
4 = 0.5.
Therefore, the graph passes through (0.5, 0).
Mark the points (0,2) and (0.5,0), on the x- and y-axes and join
the two points. This is done in Figure 2.3(a).
(b)
Sketch the graph of y = −4x When x = 0 we get y = 0, that is
the graph goes through the point (0,0). In this case, as the graph
passes through the origin, we need to choose a different value for x
for the second point. Taking x = 2 gives y = −8, so another point
is (2, −8). These points on marked on the graph and joined to give
the graph as in Figure 2.3(b).

2.3 The
quadratic
function:
y = ax 2 +bx +c
y = ax2 + bx + c is a general way of writing a function in which the
highest power of x is a squared term. This is called the quadratic function
and its graph is called a parabola as shown in Figure 2.4.
All the graphs, in this ﬁgure, cross the y-axis at (0, c). To ﬁnd where
they cross the x-axis can be more difﬁcult. These values, where f (x) = 0,
are called the roots of the equation. There is a quick way to discover
whether the function crosses the x-axis, only touches the x-axis, or does
not cross or touch it. In the latter case there are no solutions to the equation
f (x) = 0. The three possibilities are given in Figure 2.4.
Crossing the x-axis
The function y = ax2 + bx + c crosses the x-axis when y = 0, that is,
when ax2+bx+c = 0. The solutions to ax2+bx+c = 0 are examined in
the Background Mathematics Notes available on the companion website
for this book and are given by the formula

b = 12, c = −11, b2 −4ac =

144 −132 = 12.
From the graph, we can see there are three possibilities:
1.
In Figure 2.4(a) where there are two solutions, that is, the graph
crosses the x-axis for two values of x. For this to happen, the square
root part of the formula above must be greater than zero:
b2 −4ac > 0
Examples are given in Figure 2.5.
2.
Only one unique solution, as in Figure 2.4(b). The graph touches the
x-axis in one place only. For this to happen, the square root part of the
formula must be exactly 0. Examples of this are given in Figure 2.6.
3.
No real solutions, that is, the graph does not cross the x-axis.
Examples of these are given in Figure 2.7.
2.4 The
function y = 1/x
The function y = 1/x has the graph as in Figure 2.8. This is called
a hyperbola. Notice that the domain of f (x) = 1/x does not include
x = 0. The graph does not cross the x-axis so there are no solutions to
1/x = 0.
2.5 The
functions y = ax
Graphs of exponential functions, y = ax, are shown in Figure 2.9. The
functions have the same shape for all a > 1. Notice that the function is
always positive and the graph does not cross the x-axis so there are no
solutions to the equation ax = 0.

sketching using
simple
transformations
One way of sketching graphs is to remember the graphs of simple func-
tions and to translate, reﬂect or scale those graphs to get graphs of other
functions. We begin with the graphs below as given in Figure 2.10.
The translation x →x + a
If we have the graph of y = f (x), then the graph of y = f (x + a) is
found by translating the graph of y = f (x) a units to the left. Examples
are given in Figure 2.11.

we use: (a) y = x; (b) y = x 2; (c) y = x 3; (d) y = 1/x; (e) y = ax.

Examples are given in Figure 2.12.
Reﬂection about the y-axis, x →−x
Replacing x by −x in the function has the effect of reﬂecting the graph
in the y-axis – that is, as though a mirror has been placed along the axis
and only the reﬂection can be seen. Examples are given in Figure 2.13.
Reﬂection about the x axis,
f (x) →−f (x)
To ﬁnd the graph of y = −f (x), reﬂect the graph of y = f (x) about the
x-axis. Examples are given in Figure 2.14.

Multiplying the values of x by a number, a, has the effect of: squashing
the graph horizontally if a > 1 or stretching the graph horizontally if
0 < a < 1. Examples are given in Figure 2.15.

Multiplying the function value by a number A has the effect of stretching

A < 1. Examples are given in Figure 2.16.
Reﬂecting in the line y = x
If the graph of a function y = f (x) is reﬂected in the line y = x,
then it will give the graph of the inverse relation. Examples are given in
Figure 2.17.
TLFeBOOK

40
Functions and their graphs
Figure 2.17
Reﬂections in the line y = x produce the inverse relation. (a) (i) y = 2x; (ii) y = log2(x). The
second graph is obtained from the ﬁrst by reﬂecting in the dotted line y = x. The inverse is a function as there
is only one value of y for each value of x. (b) (i) y = x 2; (ii) y = ±√x. The second graph is found by reﬂecting
the ﬁrst graph in the line y = x. Notice that y = ±√x is not a function as there is more that one possible
value of y for each value of x > 0.
In Chapter 1, we deﬁned the inverse function as taking any image
back to its original value. Check this with the graph of y = 2x in
Figure 2.17(a): x = 1 gives y = 2. In the inverse function, y = log2(x),
substitute 2, which gives the result of 1, which is back to the original
value.
However, the inverse of y = x2, y ± √x, shown in Figure 2.17(b), is
not a function as there is more than one y value for a single value of x.
To understand this problem more fully, perform the following exper-
iment. On a calculator enter −2 and square it (x2) giving 4. Now take
the square root. This gives the answer 2, which is not the number we ﬁrst
started with, and hence we can see that the square root is not a true inverse
of squaring. However, we get away with calling it the inverse because it
works if only positive values of x are considered. To test if the inverse
of any function exists, draw a line along any value of y = constant.
If, wherever the line is drawn, there is ever more than one x value
which gives the same value of y then the function has no inverse func-
tion. In this situation, the function is called a ‘many-to-one’ function.
Only ‘one-to-one’ functions have inverses. Figure 2.18 has examples
of functions with an explanation of whether they are ‘one-to-one’ or
‘many-to-one’.

Figure 2.18
(a) (i) y = x 3. This function has only one x value for each value of y as any line y = constant
only cuts the graph once. In this case, the function is one-to-one and it has an inverse function (ii) y =
3√x is
the inverse function of y = x 3. (b) y = 1/x, x ̸= 0, has only one x value for each value of y as any line
y = constant only cuts the graph once. It therefore is one-to-one and has an inverse function – in fact, it is
its own inverse! (to see this reﬂect it in the line y = x and we get the same graph after the reﬂection).
(c) (i) y = x 4. This function has two values of x for each value of y when y is positive (e.g. the line y = 16 cuts
the graph twice at x = 2 and at x = −2). This shows that there is no inverse function as the function is
many-to-one. (ii) The inverse relation y = ± 4√x.
2.7 The
modulus
function,
y = |x| or
y = abs(x)
The modulus function y = |x|, often written as y = abs(x) (short for the
absolute value of x) is deﬁned by
y =

x
x ⩾0 (x positive or zero)
−x
x < 0 (x negative)
The output from the modulus function is always a positive number or zero.
Example 2.5
Find | −3|.
Here x = −3, which is negative, therefore
y = −x = −(−3) = +3.
An alternative way of thinking of it is to remember that the modulus
is always positive, or zero, so simply replacing any negative sign by a
positive one will give a number’s modulus or absolute value.
| −5| = 5,
| −4| = 4,
|5| = 5,
|4| = 4.
The graph of the modulus function can be found from the graph of y = x
by reﬂecting the negative x part of the graph to make the function values
positive. This is shown in Figure 2.19.

2.8 Symmetry
of functions and
their graphs
Functions can be classiﬁed as even, odd, or neither of these.
Even functions
Even functions are those that can be reﬂected in the y-axis and then result
in the same graph. Examples of even functions are (see Figure 2.20):
y = x2,
y = |x|,
y = x4.
As previously discussed, reﬂecting in the y-axis results from replacing x
by −x in the function expression and hence the condition for a function
to be even is that substituting −x for x does not change the function
expression, that is, f (x) = f (−x).
Example 2.6
Show that 3x2 −x4 is an even function. Substitute −x
for x in the expression f (x) = 3x2 −x4 and we get
f (−x) = 3(−x)2 −(−x)4 = 3(−1)2(x)2 −(−1)4(x)4 = 3x2 −x4.
So, we have found that f (−x) = f (x) and therefore the function is even.
Odd functions
Odd functions are those that when reﬂected in the y-axis result in an
upside down version of the same graph. Examples of odd functions are
(see Figure 2.21):
y = x,
y = x3,
y = 1
x
Reﬂecting in the y-axis results from replacing x by −x in the function
expression and the upside down version of the function f (x) is found by
multiplying the function by −1. Hence, the condition for a function to be
odd is that substituting −x for x gives −f (x), that is,
f (−x) = −f (x).
TLFeBOOK

43
Figure 2.20
y = x 2, y = |x|, and y = x 4 are even functions.
Figure 2.21
(a) y = x, (b) y = x 3, (c) y = 1/x are odd functions. If they are reﬂected in the y-axis they
result in an upside down version of the original graph.
Example 2.7
Show that 4x −(1/x) is an odd function. Substitute x for
−x in the expression f (x) = 4x −(1/x) and we get
f (−x) = 4(−x) −1
−x = −4x + 1
x = −

4x −1

.
We have found that f (−x) = −f (x), so the function is odd.
2.9 Solving
inequalities
For linear and quadratic functions, y = f (x), we have discussed how to
ﬁnd the values where the graph of the functions crosses the x-axis, that is
how to solve the equation f (x) = 0. It is often of interest to ﬁnd ranges
of values of x where f (x) is negative or where f (x) is positive. This
means solving inequalities like f (x) < 0 or f (x) > 0, respectively.
Like equations, inequalities can be solved by looking for equivalent
inequalities. One way of ﬁnding these is by doing the same thing to both
sides of the expression. There is an important exception for inequalities
TLFeBOOK

44
Functions and their graphs
that if both sides are multiplied or divided by a negative number then the
direction of the inequality must be reversed.
To demonstrate these equivalences begin with a true proposition
3 < 5
or
‘3 is less than 5’.
Add 2 on to both sides and it is still true
3 + 2 < 5 + 2,
i.e. 5 < 7.
Subtract 10 from both sides and we get
5 −10 < 7 −10,
i.e. −5 < −3
which is also true.
Multiply both sides by −1 and if we do not reverse the inequality we get
(−1)(−5) < (−1)(−3),
i.e. 5 < 3
which is false. However, if we use the correct rule that when multiplying
by a negative number we must reverse the inequality sign then we get:
(−1)(−5) > (−1)(−3),
i.e. 5 > 3
which is true. This process is pictured in Figure 2.22.
Note that inequalities can be read from right to left as well as from left
to right: 3 < 5 can be read as ‘3 is less than 5’ or as ‘5 is greater than 3’
and so it can also be written the other way round as 5 > 3.
Using a number line to represent
inequalities
An inequality can be expressed using a number line as in Figure 2.23. In
Figure 2.23(a), the open circle indicates that 3 is not included in the set
of values, t < 3. In Figure 2.23(b), the closed circle indicates that −2 is
included in the set of values, x ⩾−2. In Figure 2.23(c), the closed circle
indicates that the value 4.5 is included in the set y ⩽4.5.
Figure 2.22
On the number line, numbers to the left are less than numbers to their right: −5 < −3 . If the
inequality is multiplied by −1 we need to reverse the sign to get 5 > 3.

(a)
2t + 3 < t −6
⇔
2t −t + 3 < −6
(subtract t from both
sides)
⇔
t < −6 −3
(subtract 3 from both sides)
⇔
t < −9.
This solution can be represented on a number line as in Figure 2.24.
(b)
x + 5 ⩾4x −10
⇔
+5 ⩾3x −10
(subtract x from both sides)
⇔
15 ⩾3x
(add 10 to both sides)
⇔
5 ⩾x
(divide both sides by 3)
⇔
x ⩽5.
This solution in represented in Figure 2.25.
(c)
16 −y > −5y
⇔
16 > −4y
(add y to both sides)
⇔
−4 < y
(divide by −4and reverse the sign)
⇔
y > −4.
This solution is represented in Figure 2.26.
Representing compound inequalities
on a number line
We sometimes need a picture of the range of values given if two inequal-
ities hold simultaneously, for instance x ⩾3 and x < 5. This is analysed
TLFeBOOK

46
Functions and their graphs
Figure 2.27

or x ⩾0.
in Figure 2.27(a) and we can see that for both inequalities to hold simulta-
neously x must lie in the overlapping region where 3 ⩽x < 5. 3 ⩽x < 5
is a way of expressing that x lies between 3 and 5 or is equal to 3. In the
example in Figure 2.27(b), x > 6 and x > 2, and for them both to hold
then x > 6.
Another possible way of combining inequalities is to say that one or
another inequality holds. Examples of this are given in Figure 2.27(c)
where x < 5 or x ⩾7 and this gives the set of values less than 5 or
greater than or equal to 7. Figure 2.27(d) gives the example where x < 2
or x ⩾0 and in this case it results in all numbers lying on the number
line, that is, x ∈R.
Example 2.9
Find solutions to the following combinations of inequal-
ities and represent them on a number line.
(a)
x + 3 > 4 and x −1 < 5,
(b)
1 −u < 3u + 2 or u + 2 ⩾6,
(c)
t + 5 > 12 and −t > 24.
Solution
(a)
x + 3 > 4 and x −1 < 5 We solve both inequalities separately
and then combine their solution sets
x + 3 > 4
⇔
x > 1
(subtracting 3 from both sides)
x −1 < 5
⇔
x < 6
(adding 1 to both sides)
So the combined inequality giving the solution is x > 1 and x < 6,
which from Figure 2.28(a) we can see is the same as 1 < x < 6.
(b)
1 −u < 3u + 2 or u + 2 ⩾6
We solve both inequalities separately and then combine their

solution sets.
1 −u < 3u + 2
⇔
−1 < 4u
(subtracting 2 from both sides)
⇔
−1
4 < u
(dividing both sides by 4)
⇔
u > −1
4
u + 2 ⩾6
⇔
u ⩾4
(subtracting 2 from both sides)
Combining the two solutions gives u > −1/4 or u ⩾4 and this
is represented on the number line in Figure 2.28(b) where we can
see that it is the same as u > −1/4.
(c)
t + 5 > 12 and −t > 24
t + 5 > 12
⇔
t > 7
(subtracting 5 from both sides)
−t > 24
⇔
t < −24
(multiply both sides by −1 and reverse the
inequality sign)
Combining the two solutions sets gives t > 7 and t < −24 and we
can see from Figure 2.28(c) that this is impossible and hence there
are no solutions.
Solving more difﬁcult inequalities
To solve more difﬁcult inequalities, our ideas about equivalence are not
enough on their own, we also use our knowledge about continuous func-
tions. In the previous chapter, we deﬁned a continuous function as one
that could be drawn without taking the pen off the paper. If we wish to
solve the inequality f (x) > 0 and we know that f (x) is continuous then
we can picture the problem graphically as in Figure 2.29. From the graph
TLFeBOOK

48
Functions and their graphs
Figure 2.29
The graph of a continuous function. To solve for
f (x) > 0, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the values where f (x) = 0. On the graph these
are marked as a, b, c, and d. If the function is above the x-axis then
the function values are positive, if the function lies below the x-axis
then the function values are negative. The solution to f (x) > 0 is
given by those values of x for which the function lies above the x-axis,
that is, y positive. For the function represented in the graph the
solution to f (x) > 0 is x < a or b < x < c or x > d
.
Figure 2.30
Solving t 2 −3t + 2 < 0 (Example 2.10).
we can see that to solve the inequality we need only ﬁnd the values where
f (x) = 0 (the roots of f (x) = 0) and determine whether f (x) is positive
or negative between the values of x where f (x) = 0. To do this, we can
use any value of x between the roots. We are using the fact that as f (x)
is continuous then it can only change from positive to negative by going
through zero.
Example 2.10
Find the values of t such that t2 −3t < −2.
Write the inequality with 0 on one side of the inequality sign
t2 −3t < −2 ⇔t2 −3t + 2 < 0
(adding 2 to both sides)
Find the solutions to f (t) = t2 −3t +2 = 0 and mark them on a number
line as in Figure 2.30.
Using the formula
t = −b ±

or

⇔t = 2
or

Substitute values for t which lie on either side of the roots of f (t) in
order to ﬁnd the sign of the function between the roots. Here we choose
0, 1.5, and 3.
TLFeBOOK

Functions and their graphs
49
When t = 0
t2 −3t + 2 = (0)2 −3(0) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
which is positive, giving f (t) > 0.
When t = 1.5
t2 −3t + 2 = (1.5)2 −3(1.5) + 2 = 2.25 −4.5 + 2 = −0.25
which is negative giving f (t) < 0.
When t = 3
t2 −3t + 2 = (3)2 −3(3) + 2 = 9 −9 + 2 = 2
which is positive, giving f (t) > 0.
By marking the regions on the number line, given in Figure 2.30, with
f (t) > 0, f (t) < 0, or f (t) = 0 as appropriate we can now ﬁnd the
solution to our inequality f (t) < 0 which is given by the region where
1 < t < 2.
Example 2.11
Find the values of x such that (x2 −4)(x + 1) > 0.
Solution
The inequality already has 0 on one side of the inequality sign
so we begin by ﬁnding the roots to f (x) = 0, that is,
(x2 −4)(x + 1) > 0
Factorization gives
(x2 −4)(x + 1) > 0 ⇔(x −2)(x + 2)(x + 1) = 0
⇔x = 2, x = −2, or x = −1. So the roots are −2, −1, and 2. These
roots are pictured on the number line in Figure 2.31.
Substitute values for x which lie on either side of the roots of f (x) in
order to ﬁnd the sign of the function between the roots. Here we choose
−3, −1.5, 0, and 2.5.
When x = −3
(x −2)(x + 2)(x + 1) = 0
gives
(−3 −2)(−3 + 2)(−3 + 1)
= (−5)(−1)(−2)
= −10,
giving f (x) < 0.
When x = −1.5
(x −2)(x + 2)(x + 1)
gives
(−1.5 −2)(−1.5 + 2)(−1.5 + 1)
= (−3.5)(0.5)(−0.5) = 0.875,
giving f (x) > 0.
When x = 0
(x −2)(x + 2)(x + 1)
gives
(0 −2)(0 + 2)(0 + 1)
= (−2)(2)(1) = −4,
giving f (x) < 0.

When x = 2.5
(x −2)(x + 2)(x + 1) gives (2.5 −2)(2.5 + 2)(2.5 + 1)
= (0.5)(4.5)(3.5) = 7.875, giving f (x) > 0.
These regions are marked on the number line as in Figure 2.31 and
the solution is given by those regions where f (x) > 0. Looking for the
regions where f (x) > 0 gives the solution as −2 < x < −1 or x > 2.
2.10 Using
graphs to ﬁnd
an expression
for the function
from
experimental
data
Linear relationships
Linear relationships are the easiest ones to determine from experimental
data. The points are plotted on a graph and if they appear to follow a
straight line then a line can be drawn by hand and the equation can be
found using the method given in Section 2.2.
Example 2.12
A spring is stretched by hanging various weights on it
and in each case the length of the spring is measured.

Approximate the length of the spring when no weight is hung from it
and ﬁnd the expression for the length in terms of the mass.
Solution
First, draw a graph of the given experimental data. This is done
in Figure 2.32.
A line is ﬁtted by eye to the data. The data does not lie exactly on a line
due to experimental error and due to slight distortion of the spring with
heavier weights. From the line we have drawn we can ﬁnd the gradient
by choosing any two points on the line and calculating
change in y
change in x .
Taking the two points as (0,0.28) and (2,0.58), we get the gradient as
0.58 −0.38
2 −0
= 0.2
2 = 0.1.
The point where it crosses the y-axis, that is, where the mass hung
on the spring is 0 can be found by extending the line until it crosses the
y-axis. This gives 0.38 m.
Finally, theexpressionforthelengthintermsofthemassoftheattached
weight is given by y = mx + c, where y is the length and x is the mass,

experimental data and the
equation of the line can be

m is the gradient and c is the value of y when x = 0, that is, where there
is no weight on the string. This gives
length = 0.1 × mass + 0.38
The initial length of the spring is 0.38 m.
Exponential relationships
Many practical relationships behave exponentially particularly those
involving growth or decay. Here it is slightly less easy to ﬁnd the rela-
tionship from the experimental data, however, it is simpliﬁed by using a
log–linear plot. Instead of plotting the values of the dependent variable,
y, we plot the values of log10(y). If the relationship between y and time,
t, is exponential as we suspected then the log10(y) against t plot will be
a straight line.
The reason this works can be explained as follows. Supposing y = y0
10kt where y0 is the value of y when t = 0 and k is some constant; then,
taking the log base 10 of both sides, we get
log10(y) = log10(y010kt)
= log10(y0) + log10(10kt).
As the logarithm base 10 and raising to the power of 10 are inverse
operations, we get
log10(y) = log10(y0) + kt
As y0 is a constant, the initial value of y, and k is a constant then we can
see that this expression shows that we shall get a straight line if log10(y)
is plotted against t. The constant k is given by the gradient of the line and
log10(y0) is the value of log10 y where it crosses the vertical axis. Setting
Y = log10(y), c = log10(y0)
Y = c + kt
which is the equation of the straight line.

tiesbyplayingasinglenoteonatrombone. Oncethesoundhadreachedits
maximum intensity, the player stopped and the sound intensity was mea-
sured for the next 0.2 s at regular intervals of 0.02 s. The initial maximum
intensity at time 0 is 1.0. The readings were as follows:

time and use the latter plot to approximate the relationship between the
intensity and time.

Functions and their graphs
We can see that the second graph is approximately a straight line and
therefore we can assume that the relationship between the intensity and
time is exponential and could be expressed as I = I010kt. The log10 of
this gives
log10(I) = log10(I0) + kt.
From the graph in Figure 2.33(b), we can measure the gradient, k. To do
this we calculate
change in log10(intensity)
change in time
giving
−2.2 −0
0.2 −0 = −11 = k.
The point at which it crosses the vertical axis gives
log10(I0) = 0 ⇔I0 = 100 = 1.
Therefore, the expression I = I010kt becomes
I = 10−11t.
Power relationships
Another common type of relationship between quantities is when there
is a power of the independent variable involved. In this case, if y = axn
where n could be positive or negative then the value of a and n can be
found by drawing a log–log plot.
This is because taking log10 of both sides of y = axn gives
log10(y) = log10(axn) = log10(a) + n log10(x)
Replacing Y = log10(y) and X = log10(x) we get:
Y = log10(a) + nX,
showing that the log–log plot will give a straight line, where the slope of
the line will give the power of x and the position where the line crosses
the vertical axis will give the log10(a). Having found a and n, they can
be substituted back into the expression
y = axn.

The power received from a beacon antenna is though to
depend on the inverse square of the distance from the antenna and the

To test whether the relationship is indeed a power relationship,

As the second graph is a straight line, we can assume that the relation-
ship is of the form P = Arn where P is the power and r is the distance.
In which case, the log–log graph is
log10(P) = log10(A) + n log10(r).
We can measure the slope by calculating
change in log10(P)
change in log10(r)
and, using the two points that have been found to lie on the line, this gives
−1.8 −(−0.38)
0.7 −0
= −2.03.
As this is very near to −2, the inverse square law would appear to be
justiﬁed.
The value of log10(A) is given from where the graph crosses the vertical
axis and this gives
log10(A) = −0.38
⇔
A = 10−0.38
⇔
A = 0.42.
So the relationship between power received and distance is approximately
P = 0.42r−2 = 0.42

2.11 Summary
1.
The linear function y = mx + c has gradient (slope) m and crosses
the y-axis at y = c.
2.
The gradient, m, of a straight line y = mx + c is given by:
m = change in y
change in x
and this is the same along the length of the line.
3.
The equation of a line which goes through two points, (x1, y1) and
(x2, y2) is:
y −y1
y2 −y1
= x −x1
x2 −x1
where y2 ̸= y1.
4.
The graph of the quadratic function y = ax2 + bx + c is called a
parabola. The graph crosses the y-axis (when x = 0) at y = c.
5.
There are three possibilities for the roots of the quadratic equation
a x2 + bx + c = 0
Case I:
two real roots when b2 −4ac > 0,
Case II:
only one unique root when b2 −4ac = 0,
Case III:
no real roots when b2 −4ac < 0.
6.
By considering the graphs of known functions y = f (x), for
instance, those given in Figure 2.10, and the following transfor-
mations, many other graphs can be drawn.
(a)
Replacing x by x + a in the function y = f (x) results in
shifting the graph a units to the left.
(b)
Replacing f (x) by f (x) + A results in shifting the graph A
units upwards.
(c)
Replacing x by −x reﬂects the graph in the y-axis.
(d)
Replacing f (x) by −f (x) reﬂects the graph in the x-axis
(turning it upside down).
(e)
Replacing x by ax squashes the graph horizontally if a > 1
or stretches it horizontally if 0 < a < 1.
(f)
Replacing f (x) by Af (x) stretches the graph vertically if A >
1 or squashes it vertically if 0 < A < 1.
(g)
Reﬂecting the graph of y = f (x) in the line y = x results in
the graph of the inverse relation.
7.
A function may be even, or odd, or neither of these.
(a)
An even function is one whose graph remains the same if
reﬂected in the y-axis, that is, when x 	→−x. This can also
be expressed by the condition
f (−x) = f (x)
Examples of even functions are y = x2, y = |x|, and y = x4.
(b)
An odd function is one which when reﬂected in the y-axis,
that is, when x 	→−x, gives an upside down version of the
original graph (i.e. −f (x)). This can also be expressed as the
condition:
f (−x) = −f (x)
Examples of odd functions are y = x and y = x3.
8.
Not all functions have true inverses. Only one-to-one functions have
inverse functions. A function is one-to-one if any line y = constant
drawn on the graph y = f (x) crosses the function only once. This
means there is exactly one value of x that gives each value of y.

same expression added or subtracted. They may also be multiplied
or divided by a positive number but if they are multiplied or divided
by a negative number then the direction of the inequality sign must
be reversed.
10.
To solve the inequalities f (x) > 0, f (x) < 0, f (x) ⩽0, or f (x) ⩾
0, where f (x) is a continuous function, solve f (x) = 0 and choose
any value for x around the roots to ﬁnd the sign of f (x) for each
region of values for x.

Graphs can be used to ﬁnd relationships in experimental data. First,
plot the data then:
(a)
If the data lies on an approximate straight line then draw a
straight line through the data and ﬁnd the equation of the line.
(b)
If it looks exponential, then take the log of the values of
the dependent variable and draw a log–linear graph. If this
looks approximately like a straight line then assume there is
an exponential relationship y = y010kt, where k is given by
the gradient of the line and log10(y0) is the value where the
graph crosses the vertical axis.
(c)
If the relationship looks something like a power relationship,
y = Axn, then take the log of both sets of data and draw
a log–log graph. If this is approximately like a straight line,
then assume there is a power relationship and n is given by the
gradient of the line and log10 A is the value where the graph
crosses the vertical axis.

Problem solving
and the art of the

argument
3.1 Introduction
Mathematicsisusedbyengineerstosolveproblems. Thisusuallyinvolves
developing a mathematical model. Just as when building a working model
aeroplane we would hope to include all the important features, the same
thing applies when building a mathematical model. We would also like to
indicate the things we have had to leave out because they were too ﬁddly
to deal with, and also those details that we think are irrelevant to the
model. In the case of a mathematical model the things that have been left
out are listed under assumptions of the model. To build a mathematical
model, we usually need to use scientiﬁc rules about the way things in the
world behave (e.g. Newton’s laws of motion, conservation of momentum
and energy, Ohm’s law, Kirchoff’s laws for circuits, etc.) and use num-
bers, variables, equations, and inequalities to express the problem in a
mathematical language.
Some problems are very easy to describe mathematically. For instance:
‘Three people sitting in a room were joined by two others, how many
people are there in the room in total?’ This can be described by the sum
3 + 2 =? and can be solved easily as 3 + 2 = 5.
The ﬁnal stage of solving the problem is to translate it back into the
original setting – the answer is: ‘there are 5 people in the room in total’.
Assumptions were used to solve this problem. We assumed that no
one else came in or left the room in the meantime and we made general
assumptions about the stability of the room, for example, the building
containingitdidnotfalldown. However, theseassumptionsaresoobvious
thattheydonotneedtobelisted. Inmorecomplexproblemsitisnecessary
to list important assumptions as they may have relevance as to the validity
of the solution.
Another example is as follows: ‘There are three resistors in series in a
circuit, two of the resistors are known to have resistance of 3 and 4 ohm,
respectively. The voltage source is a battery of 12 V and the current is
measured as 1 A. What is the resistance of the third resistor?’
Figure 3.1
A simple circuit.
To help express the problem in a mathematical form we may draw a
circuit diagram as in Figure 3.1.
The problem can be expressed mathematically by using Ohm’s law
and the fact that an equivalent resistance to resistances in series is given
by the sum of the individual resistances. If x is the unknown value of the
TLFeBOOK

58
Problem solving and the art of the convincing argument
third resistance and V = RI where R = R1 + R2 + R3, we obtain:
12 = (3 + 4 + x)1
The expression of the mathematical problem has taken the form of an
equation where we now need to ﬁnd x, the value of the third resistance.
The main assumptions that have been used to build this mathematical
model are:
(1)
There are such things as pure resistors that have no capacitance or
inductance.
(2)
Resistances remain constant and are not affected by any possible
temperature changes or other environmental effects.
(3)
The battery gives a constant voltage that does not deteriorate with
time.
(4)
The battery introduces no resistance to the circuit.
These assumptions are simpliﬁcations that are acceptable because
although the real world cannot behave with the simplicity of the
mathematical model, the amount of error introduced by making these
assumptions is small.
Once we have the solution of a mathematical model then it should
be tested against a real-life situation to see whether the model behaves
reasonably closely to reality. Once the model has been accepted then it
can be used to predict the behaviour of the system for input values other
than those that it has been tested for.
The stages in solving a problem are as follows:
(1)
Take to real problem and express it as a mathematical one using any
necessary scientiﬁc rules and assumptions about the behaviour of
the system and using letters to represent any unknown quantities.
Includeanaccountofanyimportantassumptionsandsimpliﬁcations
made.
(2)
Solve the mathematical problem using your knowledge of
mathematics.
(3)
Translate the mathematical solution back into the setting of your
original problem.
(4)
Test the model solutions for some values to check that it behaves
like the real-life problem.
Most mathematical problems are expressed by using equations, or
inequalities, differential or difference equations, or by expressing a prob-
lem geometrically or a combination of all of these. We might need to
incorporate a random element which results in the need to use a prob-
abilistic model. In many of the following chapters we will look at the
modelling process in more detail as we come across new mathematical
tools and the situations in which they are used. To perform the entire
modelling cycle properly, we need to be able to test our results in a real-
life situation in order to reconsider assumptions used in the model. This
would require access to engineering situations and tools. For this reason,
engineering mathematics books tend to concentrate on those models that
are commonly used by engineers. Many of the applied problems pre-
sented in the following chapters however do present an opportunity to
move from an English language description of a problem to a mathemati-
cal language description of a problem, which is an important step in the
modelling process.
In this chapter, we will look at translating a problem into mathematical
language and, for the main part of the chapter, we concentrate on solving
a mathematical problem and the reasoning that is involved in so doing.
TLFeBOOK

Problem solving and the art of the convincing argument
59
To solve the problem using your knowledge of mathematics, we need to
use the ideas of mathematical statements and how to decide whether, and
express the fact that, one statement leads logically on to the next. We
shall mainly use examples of solving equations and inequalities although
the same ideas apply to the solving of all problems.
3.2 Describing
a problem in
mathematical
language
The stages in expressing a problem in mathematical language can be
summarized as:
(1)
Assign letters to represent the unknown quantities.
(2)
Write down the known facts using equations and inequalities, and
using drawings and diagrams where necessary.
(3)
Express the problem to be solved mathematically.
This is not a simple process because it involves a great deal of inter-
pretation of the original problem. It is useful to try to limit the number
of unknowns used as much as possible, or the problem may appear more
difﬁcult than necessary.
Example 3.1
Express the following problem mathematically: A web
development company employs a freelance web designer and a freelance
graphic designer to put up listings for new businesses on to their virtual
business park website. Business customers are charged e200 per year
for a listing. The ﬁxed costs of the web development company amount
to e2000 per week over 52 weeks in the year. The web designer charges
e80 per listing and the graphic designer e100 per listing and both can
prepare these at the rate of 2.4 listings in a day. The freelancers work for
up to 200 days per year. How many listings does the company need in
the ﬁrst year to break even?
Solution
The mathematical problem can be expressed by ﬁrstly assign-
ing letters to some of the unknown quantities and then write down all the
known facts as equations or inequalities.
First assign letters: Total number of listings of businesses on the park
in the ﬁrst year is L. LW is the number of listings prepared by the web
designerandLG isthenumberoflistingspreparedbythegraphicdesigner.
The costs are K per year and the proﬁt is P. The known facts can be
expressed as follows:
L = LW + LG
This expresses the fact that the total number of listings L is made up of
those prepared by the web designer and those prepared by the graphic
designer. As there are up to 200 working days in a year and they both do
a maximum of 2.4 listings per day.
0 ⩽LW ⩽480,
0 ⩽LG ⩽480
The costs, K, are; ﬁxed costs of 2000 × 52, plus the cost of the freelance
web designer at 80LW, plus the cost of the freelance graphic designer at
TLFeBOOK

60
Problem solving and the art of the convincing argument
100LG. This can be expressed as:
K = 104 000 + 80LW + 100LG.
We need to relate the proﬁt to the other variables. As the proﬁt is 200
multiplied by the number of jobs minus the total costs, we get:
P = 200L −K
Finally, we must express the mathematical problem that we would like to
solve. For the web development business to make a proﬁt in the ﬁrst year
then the proﬁt must be positive, hence we get the problem expressed as:
Find the minimum L such that P > 0.
Example 3.2
Express the following in mathematical language: A car
brake pedal, as represented in Figure 3.2(a) is pivoted at point A. What
is the force on the brake cable if a constant force of 900 N is applied by
the driver’s foot and the pedal is stationary.
Solution
First, we assign letters to the unknowns. Let F = the force on
the brake cable.
In order to write down the known facts we need to consider what
scientiﬁc laws can be used. As the force applied on the pedal initially
provides a turning motion then we know to use the ideas of moments.
The moment of a force about an axis is the product of the force F and its
perpendicular distance, x, to the line of action of the force. Furthermore,
as the pedal is now stationary, then the moments must be balanced so the
clockwise moment must equal the anti-clockwise moment.
To use this fact, we need to use two further measurements, currently
unknown, the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force
providedbythedrivertotheaxis, A.Thisismarkedasx1 monthediagram
in Figure 3.2(b). The other distance is the perpendicular distance from
the line of action of the force on the cable to the axis A. This is marked
as x2 m in Figure 3.2(b).
We can now write down the known facts, involving the unknowns
x1, x2, and F. From the right angle triangle containing x1, we have
Figure 3.2

quantities marked and triangles used to formulate the problem.

Fromtherightangletrianglecontaining x2, wehave(converting75 mm =
0.075 m),
cos(15◦) =

0.075
The moments of the forces can now be calculated and equated. The clock-
wise moment is 800x1 and the anti-clockwise moment is given by Fx2
and hence we have:
800x1 = Fx2
Finally, we need to express the problem we are trying to solve. In this
case it is simply ‘what is F?’.
Note that in both Examples 3.1 and 3.2, certain modelling assumptions
had been used in order to formulating the ‘natural language’ description
of the problem that we were given. For instance, it is probable that the
business park listings for the business park in Example 3.1 are not all
identical and therefore average ﬁgures for times and costings have been
used. Similarly, in Example 3.2 no mention has been made of friction
would provide an extra force to consider. Here we have only consid-
ered the transition from natural language and accompanying diagrams
to the mathematical problem. We have implicitly assumed that the mod-
elling process can be performed in two stages. From real-life problem
to a natural language description which incorporates some simplifying
assumptions, and then from there to a mathematical description. In reality
modelling a system is much more involved. We would probably repeat
stages in this process if we decided that the mathematical description was
too complex and return to the real-life situation in order to make new
assumptions.
We are now in a position to discuss mathematical statements and how
to move from the statement of the problem to ﬁnding the desired solution.
3.3
Propositions
and predicates
When we ﬁrst set up a problem to be solved, we write down mathematical
expressions like:
2 + 3 =?
(3.1)
and
12 = (3 + 4 + x) · 1
(3.2)
These are mathematical statements with an unknown value. Statements
containing unknowns (or variables) are called predicates. A predicate can
be either true or false depending on the value(s) substituted into it. When
values are substituted into a predicate it becomes a simple proposition. If
in Equation (3.1) we substitute 5 for the question mark we get:
2 + 3 = 5
⇔
5 = 5
which is true.
If, however, we substitute 6 we get:
2 + 3 = 6
⇔
5 = 6
which is false.
2 + 3 = 5 and 2 + 3 = 6 are examples of propositions. These are simple
statements that can be assigned as either true or false. They contain no
TLFeBOOK

62
Problem solving and the art of the convincing argument
unknown quantities. Notice that if we simply rewrite a proposition or
predicate we use ‘≡’ or ‘⇔’ to mean ‘is equivalent to’ or ‘is the same as’.
In Equation (3.2) if we substitute 4 for x we get:
12 = 11
which is false
but, if we substitute 5 for x we get
12 = 12
which is true.
Example 3.3
Assign true or false to the following:
(a)
(3x −2)(x + 5) = 10 where x = 1
(b)
5x2 −2x + 1 = 25 where x = −2
(c)
y > 5t + 3 where y = 2 and t = −3
Solution
(a)
Substitute x = 1 in the expression and we get:
(3 · 1 −2)(1 + 5) = 10
⇔
1(6) = 10
⇔
6 = 10
which is false.
(b)
Substituting x = −2 into 5x2 −2x + 1 = 25 gives
5(−2)2 −2(−2) + 1 = 25
⇔
20 + 4 + 1 = 25
⇔
25 = 25
which is true.
(c)
Substituting y = 2 and t = −3 into y > 5t + 3 gives
2 > 5(−3) + 3
⇔
2 > −15 + 3
⇔
2 > −12
which is true.
Like functions, predicates have a domain which is the set of all allowed
inputs to the predicate. For instance, the predicate 1/(x −1) = 1, where
x ∈R, has the restriction that x ̸= 1, as letting x equal 1 would lead to
an attempt to divide by 0, which is not deﬁned.
√
x −2 = 25 where x ∈R has the restriction that x ⩾2, as values of
x less than 2 would lead to an attempt to take the square root of a negative
number, which is not deﬁned.
3.4 Operations
on propositions
and predicates
Consider the problem given in Example 3.1. Notice that the conditions
that we discovered when writing down the known facts must all be true
in any solution that we come up with. If any one of these conditions is
not true then we cannot accept the solution. The ﬁrst condition must be
true and the second and the third, etc.
Here we have an example of an operation on predicates. In Chapter 1,
we deﬁned an operation on numbers is a way of combining two numbers
to give a single number. ‘And’, written as ∧is an operation on two
predicates or propositions which results a single predicate or proposition.

Therefore, to express the fact that both L ⩾0 and L = LW + LG we can
write
L ⩾0 ∧L = LW + LG
and the compound statement is true if each part is also true.
As propositions can only be either true (T) or false (F), all possible
outcomes of the operation can easily be listed in a small table called a
truth table. The truth table for the operation of ‘and’ is given in Table 3.1.
p and q represent any two propositions, for instance, for some given
values of L, LW, and LG, p and q could be deﬁned by:
p: ‘L ⩾0’
q: ‘L = LW + LG’

This table can also be
expressed by

for ‘true’ and F stands
for ‘false’

Another important operation is that of ‘or’. One example of the use of
this operation comes about by solving a quadratic equation. One way of
solving quadratic equations is to factorize an expression which is equal
to 0.
To solve x2 −x −6 = 0, the left-hand side of the equation can be
factorized to give (x −3)(x + 2) = 0.
Now we use the fact that for two numbers multiplied together to equal
0 then one of them, at least, must be 0, to give:
(x −3)(x + 2) = 0
⇔
(x −3) = 0
or
(x + 2) = 0
‘or’ can be written using the symbol ∨. The compound statement is true
if either x −3 = 0 is true or if x + 2 = 0 is true. Therefore, to express
the statement that either x −3 = 0 or x + 2 = 0 we can write:
(x −3) = 0 ∨(x + 2) = 0
∨is also called ‘non-exclusive or’ because it is also true if both parts of
the compound statement are true. This usage is unlike the frequent use of
‘or’ in the English language, where it is often used to mean a choice, for
example, ‘you may have either an apple or a banana’ implies either one
or the other but not both. This everyday usage of the word ‘or’ is called
‘exclusive or’.
The truth table for ‘or’ is given in Table 3.2.

A further operation is that of ‘not’ which is represented by the
symbol ¬. For instance, we could express the sentence ‘x is not bigger
than 4’ as ¬(x > 4).
The truth table for ‘not’ is given in Table 3.3.
Example 3.4
Assign truth values to the following:
(a)
x −2 = 3 ∧x2 = 4 when x = 2
(b)
x −2 = 3 ∨x2 = 4 when x = 2
(c)
¬(x −4 = 0) when x = 4
(d)
¬((a −b) = 4) ∨(a + b) = 2 when a = 5, b = 3
Solution
(a)
x −2 = 3 ∧x2 = 4 when x = 2
Substitute x = 2 into the predicate, x −2 = 3 ∧x2 = 4 and we get
2 −3 = 3 ∧22 = 4.

The ﬁrst part of the compound statement is false and the second part
is true. Overall, as F ∧T ⇔F, the proposition is false.
(b)
x −2 = 3 ∨x2 = 4 when x = 2
Substitute x = 2 into the predicate and we get
2 −2 = 3 ∨22 = 4
The ﬁrst part of the compound statement is false and second part is
true. As F ∨T ⇔T , the proposition is true.
(c)
¬(x −4 = 0) when x = 4
When x = 4 the expression becomes:
¬(4 −4 = 0)

(d)
¬((a −b) = 4) ∨(a + b) = 2 when a = 5, b = 3

b = 3 is true.
Example 3.5
Represent the following inequalities on a number line:
(a)
x > 2 ∧x ⩽4
(b)
x < 2 ∨x ⩾4
(c)
¬(x < 2)
Solution
(a)
x > 2 ∧x ⩽4. To represent the operation of ‘and’, ﬁnd where
the two regions overlap (Figure 3.3a). x > 2 ∧x ⩽4 can also be
represented by 2 < x ⩽4.
(b)
x < 2 ∨x ⩾4. To represent the operation of ∨, ‘or’, take all points
on the ﬁrst highlighted region as well as all points in the second
highlighted region and any end points (Figure 3.3b).
(c)
¬(x < 2). To represent the operation of ‘not’ take all the points on
the number line not in the original region (Figure 3.3c). This can
also be expressed by x ⩾2.
3.5 Equivalence
We can now express an initial problem in terms of a predicate, probably an
equation, a number of equations, or a number of inequalities. However, to
solve the problem we need to be able to move from the original expression
of the problem toward the solution. In Chapter 3 of the Background
Mathematics Notes, available on the companion website for this book,
we discussed how to solve various types of equations and introduced the
idea of equivalent equations. In Chapter 2 we also looked at equivalent
inequalities. In both cases we used the idea that in moving from one
expression to an equivalent expression the set of solutions remained the
TLFeBOOK

same. In general, two predicates are equivalent if they are true for exactly
thesamesetofvalues. Weuseourknowledgeofmathematicstodetermine
what operations can be performed that will maintain that equivalence.
The rule that can be used to move from one equation to another was
given as: ‘Equations remain equivalent if the same operation is performed
to both sides of the equation’. In the case of quadratic equations we
can also use a formula for the solution or use a factorization and the
fact that:
ab = 0
⇔
a = 0
or
b = 0.
In passing from one equation to an equivalent equation we should use the
equivalence symbol. This then makes a mathematical sentence:
x + 5 = 3
⇔
x = 3 −5
can be read as ‘The equation x + 5 = 3 is equivalent to x = 3 −5’.
In all but the most obvious cases, it is a good practice to list a short
justiﬁcation for the equivalence by the side of the expression.
x + 5 = 3
⇔
x = 3 −5
(subtracting 5 from both sides)
⇔
x = −2.
Because of the possibility of making a mistake, the solution(s) should
be checked by substituting the values into the original expression of the
problem. To check, substitute x = −2 into the original equation giving
−2 + 5 = 3 which is true, indicating that the solution is correct.
Example 3.6
Solve the following equation:
x −3 = 5 −2x.
TLFeBOOK

66
Problem solving and the art of the convincing argument
Solution
x −3 = 5 −2x
⇔
x + 2x −3 = 5
(adding 2x to both sides)
⇔
3x = 8
(adding 3 to both sides)
⇔
x = 8
3
(dividing both sides by 3).
Check by substituting x = 8/3 into the original equation:
8
3 −3 = 5 −2 × 8
3
⇔
−1
3 = −1
3,
which is true.
We looked at methods of solving inequalities in Chapter 2. The rules
for ﬁnding equivalent inequalities were: ‘Perform the same operation to
both sides’; but in the case of a negative number when multiplying or
dividing the direction of the inequality sign must be reversed. To solve
more complex inequalities, such as f (x) > 0, f (x) < 0, where f (x) is
a continuous but non-linear function, then we solve f (x) = 0 and then
use a number line to mark regions where f (x) is positive, negative or
zero. The important thing in the process is to present a short justiﬁcation
of the equivalence. Finally, when the set of solutions has been found,
some of the solutions can be substituted into the original expression of
the problem in order to check that no mistakes have been made.
Example 3.7
Solve the following inequalities:
(a)
3x −1 < 6x + 2
(b)
x2 −5x > −6
Solution
(a)
3x −1 < 6x + 2
⇔
−1 < 6x + 2 −3x
(subtracting 3x from both sides)
⇔
−1 −2 < 3x
(subtracting 2 from both sides)
⇔
−3
3 < 3x
3
(dividing both sides by 3)
⇔
−1 < x
⇔
x > −1
Check: Test a few values from the set x > −1 and substitute into
3x −1 < 6x + 2
Try x = 0: this gives −1 < 2 ⇔T
Try x = 2: this gives 3(2) −1 < 6(2) + 2 ⇔5 < 14 ⇔T
(b)
x2 −5x > −6
Write the inequality with 0 on one side of the inequality sign
x2 −5x > −6
⇔
x2 −5x + 6 > 0
(adding 6 to both sides)
Find the solutions to f (x) = 0 where f (x) = x2 −5x + 6 and mark
them on a number line as in Figure 3.4.
x2 −5x + 6 = 0
⇔
x = 5 ±

(using the formula for solution of quadratic equations)
⇔
x = 5 + 1
2
∨x = 5 −1
2
⇔
x = 3 ∨x = 2
Using the fact that the function is continuous, we can substitute values
for x which lie on either side of the roots of f (x) = 0 in order to ﬁnd the
sign of the function in that region. Here, we choose 0, 2.5, and 4 and ﬁnd
that
when x = 0:
f (x) = x2 −5x + 6 = 6, so f (x) > 0
when x = 2.5:
f (x) = x2 −5x + 6 = 6.25 −12.5 + 6
= −0.25, so f (x) < 0
when x = 4:
f (x) = x2 −5x + 6 = 16 −20 + 6 = 2,
so f (x) > 0
These regions are marked on the number line as in Figure 3.4 and this
gives the solution to f (x) > 0 as x < 2 ∨x > 3.
Check: A check is to substitute some values from the solution set x <
2 ∨x > 3 into the original predicate x2 −5x > −6
Substitute x = 1, this gives 1 −5 > −6 ⇔−4 > −6 ⇔T
Substitute x = 5, this gives 25 −25 > −6 ⇔0 < −6 ⇔T
It therefore appears that this solution is correct.
3.6 Implication
We previously described one method of ﬁnding equivalent equations as
thatof‘doingthesamethingtobothsides’. Thiswasrathersimplisticbuta
useful way of seeing it at the time. There are only certain things that can be
‘done to both sides’ like adding, subtracting, multiplying by a non-zero
expression, or dividing by a non-zero expression that always maintain
equivalence. There are also many operations that can be performed to
both sides of an equation which do not give an equivalent equation but
give an equation with the same solutions and yet more besides. In this
situation we say that the ﬁrst equation implies the second equation. The
symbol for implies is ⇒.
An example of implication is given by squaring both sides of the
equation
x −2 = 2 ⇒(x −2)2 = 4
The ﬁrst predicate x −2 = 2 has only one solution, x = 4, the second
predicate has two solutions x = 4 and x = 0. By squaring the equation
we have found a new equation which includes all the solutions of the ﬁrst
TLFeBOOK

68
Problem solving and the art of the convincing argument
equation, and has one more beside. Implication is expressed in English
by using phrases like ‘If . . . then . . .’.
An expression involving an implication cannot always be turned the
other way around in the same way as those involving equivalence can.
An example of this is given by the following statement. It is true that: ‘If
I am going to work then I take the car’ which can be written using the
implication symbol as:
‘I am going to work’ ⇒‘I take the car’
However, it is not true that:
‘If I take the car then I am going to work’
This is because there are more occasions when I take the car than simply
going to work.
More examples are:
‘I only clean the windows if it is sunny’
‘I am cleaning the windows’ ⇒‘it is sunny’
This does not mean that ‘If it is sunny then I clean the windows’, as there
are some sunny days when I have to go to work or just laze in the garden,
or I am on holiday.
An implication sign can be written, and read, from left to right
‘It is sunny’ ⇐‘I am cleaning the windows’
which I can still read as ‘I am cleaning the windows therefore it is sunny’
or I could try rearranging the sentence as ‘Only if it is sunny will I clean
the windows’.
Figure 3.5
P is the solution
set of p, Q is the solution set
of q. p ⇒q means that
P ⊆Q. D is the domain of p
and q.
The various ways of expressing these sentiments can get quite involved.
The important point to remember is that p ⇒q means that q must be true
for all the occasions that p is true, but q could be true on more occasions
besides. Going back to equations or inequalities:
p ⇒q
means that the solution set, P, of p is a subset of the solution set, Q, of q.
This is pictured in Figure 3.5.
We can now see that for two equations or inequalities to be equivalent
then p ⇒q and q ⇒p. This means that their solution sets are exactly
the same (Figure 3.6).

P is the solution
set of p and Q is the solution
set of q. Then p ⇔q means
that P = Q.

i.e. f (x) > 0

3.7 Making
sweeping
statements
In Chapter 1 of the Background Mathematics Notes, available on the
companion website for this book, we made some statements about num-
bers which we stated were true for all real numbers. Some of these were
the commutative laws:
a + b = b + a
and
ab = ba
and the distributive law:
a(b + c) = ab + bc.
There is a symbol which stands for ‘for all’ or ‘for every’ which allows
these laws to be expressed in a mathematical shorthand
∀a, b ∈R
a + b = b + a
∀a, b ∈R
ab = ba
∀a, b, c ∈R
a(b + c) = ab + bc.
Rules, such as the commutative law, are axioms for numbers and need
not be proved true. However, more involved expressions, such as
∀a, b ∈R
(a −b)(a + b) = a2 −b2
need to be justiﬁed.
If the symbol ‘for all’ is used with a predicate about its free variable
then it becomes a simple proposition which is either true or false. To show
that an expression is true we use our knowledge of mathematics to write
equivalent expressions until we come across an expression which is obvi-
ously true (like a = a). To prove it is false is much easier. As we have
made a sweeping statement about the expression and said it is true for all
a, b then we only need to come across one example of numbers which
make the expression false.
Example 3.9
Are the following true or false? Justify your answer.

∀t ∈R, where t ̸= 1, t ̸= −1
1/(t + 1) = (t −1)/(t2 −1)
(c)
∀x ∈R, where x ̸= 0
(x2 −1)/x = x −1
TLFeBOOK

Problem solving and the art of the convincing argument
71
Solution
(a)
∀a, b ∈R
a3 −b3 = (a −b)(a2 + ab + b2)
Looking at the right-hand side of the equality we have
(a −b)(a2 + ab + b2)
= a(a2 + ab + b2) −b(a2 + ab + b2)
(taking out the brackets)
= a3 + a2b + ab2 −ba2 −ab2 −b3
(taking out the remaining brackets)
= a3 −b3
(simplifying)
We have shown that the right-hand side is equal to the left-hand side
∀a, b ∈R
a3 −b3 = (a −b)(a2 + ab + b2) ⇔a3 −b3 = a3 −b3
which is true. Therefore
∀a, b ∈R
a3 −b3 = (a −b)(a2 + ab + b2)
is true.
(b)
∀t ∈R where t ̸= 1, t ̸= −1
1/(t + 1) = (t −1)/(t2 −1)
Take the right-hand side of the equality
t −1
t2 −1 =
t −1
(t −1)(t + 1)
(factorizing the bottom line)
=
1
(t + 1)
(dividing the top and bottom line by t −1
which is allowed as t ̸= 1)
Hence
1
t + 1 = t −1
t2 −1
⇔
1
t + 1 =
1
t + 1
which is true. Thus,
∀t ∈R where t ̸= 1, t ̸= −1
1
t + 1 = t −1
t2 −1
is true.
(c)
∀x ∈R where x ̸= 0
x2 −1
x
= x −1
To show this is false, substitute a value for x, for example, x = 2. When
x = 2
x2 −1
x
= x −1
becomes
4 −1
2
= 2 −1 ⇔3
2 = 1 ⇔F.
As the predicate fails for one value of x then
∀x ∈R where x ̸= 0
(x2 −1)/x = x −1
is false.
TLFeBOOK

72
Problem solving and the art of the convincing argument
Another useful symbol is ∃, which means, ‘there exists’. This can
be used to express the fact that every real number has an inverse under
addition. Hence, we get
∀a ∈R, ∃b,
a + b = 0.
If the symbol ∃is used with a predicate about its free variable, it
becomes a simple proposition which is either true or false. In the case
of the example given concerning the inverse, this is an axiom of the
real numbers and we can just state it is true. Other statements involving
existence will need some justiﬁcation. Proving existence is simpler than
disproving it. If I were to state ‘There exists a blue moon in the universe’,
to prove this to be true I only need to ﬁnd one blue moon but to disprove
it I must ﬁnd all the moons in the universe and show that not one of them
is blue.
In other words, to show that some value exists which makes a certain
predicate into a true proposition then we only need to ﬁnd that value and
demonstrate that the resulting proposition is true. To show that no value
exists, however, is more difﬁcult and if the domain of interest is a set of
numbers we need to present an argument about any member of the set.
Example 3.10
Are the following true or false? Justify your answer.
(a)
∃x ∈R, (x + 2)(x −1) = 0
(b)
∃x ∈R, x2 + 4 < 0
Solution
(a)
∃x ∈R, (x + 2)(x −1) = 0
To show this is true, we only need ﬁnd one value of x which makes the
equality correct. For instance, take x = −2: when x = −2, (x + 2)(x −
1) = 0 becomes (−2 + 2)(−2 −1) = 0 ⇔0 = 0, which is true.
Therefore, ∃x ∈R, (x + 2)(x −1) = 0 is true.
(b)
∃x ∈R, x2 + 4 < 0
Trying a few values for x (e.g. −1, 0, 20, −2) we might suspect that
this statement is false. We need to present a general argument in order to
convince ourselves of this.
x2 is always positive or zero, that is, x2 ⩾0 for all x. If we then add
on 4, then for all x, x2 + 4 ⩾4 and as 4 is bigger than 0.
x2 + 4 > 0 for all x; hence,
∃x ∈R, x2 + 4 < 0 is false.

73
Solution
Pseudo-code is a system of writing algorithms which is similar
to some computer languages but not in any particular computer language.
We can use any symbols we like as long as the meaning is clear.
y is a multiple of x means that if y is divided by x then the result is an
integer. This can be expressed as
y
x ∈Z
The condition that x must lie between 1 and 100 can be expressed as

Example 3.12
A program is designed to take a given whole positive
number, x, greater than 1, and ﬁnd two factors of x, a and b, which
multiplied together give x. a and b should be whole positive numbers
different from 1, unless x is prime. Express the pre- and post-conditions
for the program.
Solution
Pre-condition is x ∈N ∧x > 1.
The post-condition is slightly more difﬁcult to express. Clearly ab = x
is a statement of the fact that a and b must multiply together to give x.
Also a and b must be elements of N. a and b cannot be 1 unless x is
prime, this can be expressed by
(a ̸= 1 ∧b ̸= 1) ∨(x is prime).
Finally, we have the post-condition as
a · b = x ∧(a ∈N) ∧(b ∈N) ∧((a ̸= 1 ∧b ̸= 1) ∨(x is prime)).
3.9 Summary
(1)
The stages in solving a real-life problem using mathematics are:
(a)
Express the problem as a mathematical one, using any neces-
sary scientiﬁc rules and assumptions about the behaviour of the
system and using letters to represent any unknown quantities.
This is called a mathematical model.
(b)
Solve the mathematical problem by moving from one state-
ment to an equivalent statement justifying each stage by using
relevant mathematical knowledge.
(c)
Check the mathematical solution(s) by substituting them into
the original formulation of the mathematical problem.
(d)
Translate the mathematical solution back into the setting of the
original problem.
(e)
Test the model solutions for some realistic values to see how
well the model correctly predicts the behaviour of the system.
If it is acceptable, then the model can be used to predict more
results.
(2)
A predicate is a mathematical statement containing a variable.
Examples of predicates are equations and inequalities.
(3)
If values are substituted into a predicate it becomes a simple
proposition which is either true or false.
TLFeBOOK

Problem solving and the art of the convincing argument
(4)
The three main operations on predicates and propositions are
∧, ∨, ¬, and these can be deﬁned using truth tables as in
Tables 3.1–3.3.
(5)
Two predicates, p, q, are equivalent (p ⇔q) if they are true for
exactly the same set of values.
(6)
p ⇒q means ‘p implies q’, that is, q is true whenever p is true. If
p, q are equations or inequalities and p ⇒q then all solutions of p
are also solutions of q and q may have more solutions besides.
(7)
The symbol ∀stands for ‘for all’ or ‘for every’ and can be used
with a predicate to make it into a simple proposition, for example,
∀a, b ∈R, a2 −b2 = (a + b)(a −b), which is true.
(8)
The symbol ∃stands for ‘there exists’ and can also be used with a
predicate to make it into a simple proposition, for example, ∃x ∈R,
3x = 45, which is true.

3.8. A road has a bend with radius of curvature 100 m. The
road is banked at an angle of 10◦. At what speed should
a car take the bend in order not to experience any side
thrust on the tyres? Use the following assumptions:
(a) The sideways force needed on the vehicle in order to
maintain it in circular motion (called the centripetal
force) = mv2/r where r is the radius of curvature
of the bend, v the velocity, and m the mass of the
vehicle.
(b) The only force with a component acting sideways
on the vehicle, is the reactive force of the ground.
This acts in a direction normal to the ground (i.e. we
assume no frictional force in a sideways direction).
(c) The force due to gravity of the vehicle is mg, where
m is the mass of the vehicle and g is the acceleration
due to gravity (≈9.8 m s−2). This acts vertically
downwards. The forces operating on the vehicle and
ground, in a lateral or vertical direction, are pictured
in Figure 3.8.

in the road. R is the reactive force of the ground

mg, the weight of the vehicle, operating vertically
downwards. The vehicle needs a sideways force
of mv 2/r in order to maintain the locally circular
motion.

Boolean algebra
4.1 Introduction
Boolean algebra can be thought of as the study of the set {0, 1} with the
operations + (or), . (and), and −(not). It is particularly important because
of its use in design of logic circuits. Usually, a high voltage represents
TRUE (or 1), and a low voltage represents FALSE (or 0). The operation
of OR (+) is then performed on two voltage inputs, using an OR gate,
AND(.) using an AND gate and NOT is performed using a NOT gate. This
very simple algebra is very powerful as it forms the basis of computer
hardware.
You will probably have noticed that the operations of ∧(AND), ∨
(OR), and ¬ (NOT) used in Chapter 3 for propositions are very similar
to the operations ∩(AND), ∪OR, and ′ (NOT) (complement) used for
sets. This connection is not surprising as membership of a set, A, could
be deﬁned using a statements like ‘3 is a member of A’ which is either
TRUE or FALSE. In simplifying logic circuits, use is made of the different
interpretations that can be put upon the operations and variables. We can
use truth tables, borrowed from the theory of propositions, as given in
Chapter 3, or we can use Venn diagrams, borrowed from set theory, as
given in Chapter 1.
Theﬁrstthingweshallexamineinthischapteriswhatdowemeanbyan
algebra and why are we able to skip between these various interpretations.
Then we look at implementing and minimizing logic circuits.
4.2 Algebra
Before we look at Boolean algebra, we will have a look at some ideas
about algebra:
(a)
What is an algebra?
(b)
What is an operation?
(c)
What do we mean by properties (or laws or axioms) of an algebra?
An algebra is a set with operations deﬁned on it. In Chapter 1 of the
Background Mathematics Notes, available on the companion website
for this book, we looked at the algebra of real numbers and deﬁned an
operation is a way of combining two numbers to give a single number. We
could therefore deﬁne an operation as a way of combining two elements
of the set to result in another element of the set.
Example 4.1
The set of real numbers, R, has the operations + and ., for
example,
3 + 5 = 8
and
3 · 4 = 12
TLFeBOOK

Boolean algebra
77
and we could combine any two numbers in this way and we would always
get another real number.
Example 4.2
Consider the set of sets in some universal set E, for
example,
E = {a, b, c, d, e}
A = {a, d},
B = {a, b, c}
then
A ∩B = {a}
and
A ∪B = {a, b, c, d}.
The operations of ∩and ∪also result in another set contained in E.
In both of these examples, the operations are binary operations because
they use two inputs to give one output.
There is another sort of operation which is important, called a unary
operation, because it only has one input to give one output. Consider
Example 4.2: A′ = {b, c, e} gives the complement of A. This is a unary
operation as only one input, A, was needed to deﬁne the output A′.
Ifwecanﬁndarulewhichisalwaystrueforanalgebrathenthatiscalled
a property, (law or axiom) of that algebra. For example, (3 + 5) + 4 =
3 + (5 + 4) is an application of the associative law of addition which can
be expressed in general in the following way for the set of real numbers:
∀a, b, c ∈R,
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
If we can list all the properties of a particular algebra then we can give
that algebra a name. For instance, the real numbers with the operations
of + and . form a ﬁeld.
4.3 Boolean
algebras
Sets as a Boolean algebra
The sets contained in some universal set display a number of properties
which can be shown using Venn diagrams.
Example 4.3
Show, using Venn diagrams, that, for any 3 sets A, B, C
in some universal set E,
A ∩(B ∪C) = (A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C).
Solution
This can be shown to be true by drawing a Venn diagram
of the left-hand side of the expression and another of the right-hand
side of the expression. Operations are performed in the order indicated
by the brackets and the result of each operation is given a different
shading. This is done in Figure 4.1(a) and (b). The region shaded in
Figure 4.1(a) representing A ∩(B ∪C) is the same as that representing
(A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C) in Figure 4.1(b), hence, showing that A ∩(B ∪C) =
(A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C).

Notice that all the laws come in pairs (called duals). A dual of a rule
is given by replacing ∪by ∩and ∅by E and vice versa.
Propositions
We looked at propositions in Chapter 3. Propositions can either be given
a value of TRUE (T) or FALSE (F). Examples of propositions are 3 = 5
which is false and 2 < 3 which is true. The logical operators of AND, OR,
and NOT are deﬁned using truth tables, which we repeats in Table 4.1.
Properties of propositions and their operations can be shown using
truth tables.
Example 4.4
Show, using truth tables, that for any propositions p, q, r
(p ∧q) ∧r = p ∧(q ∧r)
Solution
The truth tables are given in Table 4.2. Note that there are eight
lines in the truth table in order to represent all the possible states (T, F) for
the three variables p, q, and r. As each can be either TRUE or FALSE, in
total there are 23 = 8 possibilities. To ﬁnd (p∧q)∧r, p∧q is performed
ﬁrst and the result of that is ANDed with r. To ﬁnd p∧(q∧r) then q∧r is
performed ﬁrst and p is ANDed with the result. As the resulting columns
are equal we can conclude that
(p ∧q) ∧r
⇔
p ∧(q ∧r)

The Boolean set {0, 1}
The simplest Boolean algebra is that deﬁned on the set {0,1}. The oper-
ations on this set are AND (.), OR (+), and NOT (−). The operations can
be deﬁned using truth tables as in Table 4.1, shown again in Table 4.4.
This time notice that the ﬁrst two are usually ordered in order to mimic
binary counting, starting with 0 0, then 0 1, then 1 0, then 1 1. This is
merely a convention and the rows may be ordered any way you like. a
and b are two variables which may take the values 0 or 1.
This now looks far more like arithmetic. However, beware because
although the operation AND behaves like multiplication, 0.0 = 0, 0.1 =
0, 1.0 = 0 and 1.1 = 1 as in ‘ordinary’ arithmetic, the operation OR
behaves differently as 1 + 1 = 1.
All the laws as given for sets and for propositions hold again and they
can be listed as follows:
For any three variables a, b, c ∈{0, 1}
(B1) a + a = a
a.a = a
Idempotent
(B2) a + (b + c)
a.(b.c) = (a.b).c
Associative
= (a + b) + c
(B3) a + b = b + a

a.(a + b) = a

De Morgan’s laws
We often leave out the ‘.’ so that ‘ab’ means ‘a.b’. We also adopt
the convention that . takes priority over + hence miss out some of the
brackets.
Example 4.6
Evaluate the following where +, ., and −are Boolean
operators.
(a)
1.1.0 + ¯0.1
(b)
(1.¯1) + 1
(c)
(¯1 + 1).0 + (1 + 1).0
TLFeBOOK

Boolean algebra
81
Solution
(a)
We use the convention that . is performed ﬁrst:
1.1.0 + ¯0.1 = 0 + 1.1 = 0 + 1 = 1
(b)
(1.¯1) + 1 = (1.0) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
(c)
(¯1 + 1).0 + (1 + 1).0 = 1.0 + 1.0 = 0 + 0 = 0
The algebraic laws can be used to simplify a Boolean expression.
Example 4.7
Simplify
abc + ¯abc + b¯c
Solution
abc + ¯ab + b¯c
= (a + ¯a)bc + b¯c
(using a distributive law)
= 1.bc + b¯c
(using a complement law)
= bc + b¯c
(using an identity law)
= b(c + ¯c)
(by one of the distributive laws)
= b
(using a complement and identity law)
Although it is possible to simplify in this way, it can be quite difﬁcult
to spot the best way to perform the simpliﬁcation; hence, there are special
techniques used in the design of digital circuits which are more efﬁcient.
4.4 Digital
circuits
Switching circuits form the basis of computer hardware. Usually, a high
voltage represents TRUE (or 1) while a low voltage represents a FALSE
(or 0). Digital circuits can be represented using letters for each input.
There are three basic gates which combine inputs and represent the
operators NOT(−), AND (.), and OR (+). These are shown in Figure 4.2.
Figure 4.2
The three basic
gates; NOT (−), AND (.), and
OR (+).
Other gates
Other common gates used in the design of digital circuits are the NAND
gate, (ab), that is, not(ab), the NOR gate, (a + b), that is, not(a + b) and
the EXOR gate, a ⊕b, (exclusive or) a ⊕b = a ¯b + ab
These gates are shown in Figure 4.3.
Implementing a logic circuit
First, we need to simplify the expression. Each letter represents an input
that can be on or off (1 or 0). The operations between inputs are rep-
resented by the gates. The output from the circuit represents the entire
Boolean expression.
Figure 4.3
Three other
common gates; NAND (ab),
NOR (a + b), and EXOR
(a ⊕b).
TLFeBOOK

Boolean algebra
Example 4.8
Implement ab¯c + a ¯b + a ¯c.
Solution
We can use absorption to write this as a ¯b + a ¯c and this can
be implemented as in Figure 4.4 using AND, OR, and NOT gates. Alter-
natively, we can use the distributive and De Morgan’s laws to write the
expression as:
a ¯b + a ¯c = a(¯b + ¯c) = abc
which can be implemented using an AND and a NAND gate.
Minimization and Karnaugh maps
It is clear that there are numbers of possible implementations of the same
logic circuit. However, in order to use less components in building the
circuititisimportanttobeabletominimizetheBooleanexpression. There
are several methods for doing this. A popular method is using a Karnaugh
map. Before using a Karnaugh map, the Boolean expression must be
written in the form of a ‘sum of products’. To do this, we may either
use some of the algebraic rules or it may be simpler to produce a truth
table and then copy the 0s and 1s into the Karnaugh map. Example 4.9 is
initially in the sum of product form and Example 4.10 uses a truth table
to ﬁnd the Karnaugh map.
Example 4.9
Minimize the following using a Karnaugh map:
ab + ¯ab + a ¯b
and draw the implementation of the resulting expression as a logic circuit.
Solution
Draw a Karnaugh map as in Figure 4.5(a). If there are two
variables in the expression then there are 22 = 4 squares in the Karnaugh
map. Figure 4.5(b) shows a Karnaugh map with the squares labelled term

sets a and b. In Figure 4.5(a) we put a 0 or 1 in the square depending on
whether that term is present in our expression. Adjacent 1s indicate that
we can simplify the expression. Figure 4.6 indicates how we go about the
minimization. We draw a line around any two adjacent 1s and write down
the term representing that section of the map. We are able to encircle the
second row, representing a, and the second column, representing b. As
all the 1s have now been included we know that a + b is a minimization
of the expression. Notice that it does not matter if one of the squares
with a 1 in it has been included twice but we must not leave any out. The
implementation of a + b is drawn in Figure 4.7.

Example 4.10
Minimize c(b + (ab)) + ¯cab and draw the implementa-
tion of the resulting expression as a logic circuit.
Solution
First, we need to ﬁnd the expression as a sum of products.
This can be done by ﬁnding the truth table and then copying the result
into the Karnaugh map. The truth table is found in Table 4.5. Notice
that we calculate various parts of the expression and build up to the ﬁnal
expression. With practice, the expression can be calculated directly for
instance when a = 0, b = 0, and c = 0 then c(b + (ab)) + ¯cab =
0(0 + (0.0)) + ¯0.0.0
= 0(0 + 1) + 1.0 = 0.
Draw a Karnaugh map as in Figure 4.8(a) and copy in the expres-
sion values as found in Table 4.5. There are three variables in the
expression, therefore, there are 23 = 8 squares in the Karnaugh map.

Boolean algebra
Figure 4.8(b) shows a Karnaugh map with the squares labelled term by
term. Figure 4.8(c) shows the Venn diagram equivalence with sets a, b,
and c. In Figure 4.8(a) we put a 0 or 1 in the square depending on whether
that term is present, as given in the truth table in Table 4.5.
Adjacent 1s indicate that we can simplify the expression. Figure 4.9
indicates how we go about the minimization. We draw a line around any
four adjacent 1s and write down the term representing that section of
the map. The second column represents c and has been encircled. Then
we look for any two adjacent 1s. We are able to encircle the third row,
representing ab. As all the 1s have now been included we know that
c + ab is a minimization of the expression. An implementation of c + ab
is drawn in Figure 4.10.
Example 4.11
Minimize ab¯c + ¯abd + abc ¯d + a ¯b¯cd + abc using a
Karnaugh map and draw the implementation of the resulting expression
as a logic circuit.
Solution
Draw a Karnaugh map as in Figure 4.11(a). There are four
variables in the expression therefore there are 24 = 16 squares in the
Karnaugh map. Figure 4.11(b) shows a Karnaugh map with the squares
labelled term by term. Figure 4.11(c) shows the Venn diagram equiv-
alence with sets a, b, c, and d. In Figure 4.11(a), we put a 0 or 1 in
the square depending on whether that term is present in our expression.
However, the term ab¯c involves only three out of the four variables. In
this case, it must occupy two squares. As d could be either 0 or 1 for
‘ab¯c’ to be true, we ﬁll in the squares for ab¯cd and ab¯c ¯d. The num-
ber of squares to be ﬁlled with a 1 to represent a certain product is 2m
where m is the number of missing variables in the expression. In this
case, ab¯c has no d term in it so the number of squares representing
it is 21.

Adjacent 1s indicate that we can simplify the expression. Figure 4.12
indicates how we go about the minimisation. We draw a line around
any eight adjacent 1s of which there are none. Next we look for any
four adjacent 1s and write down the term representing that section of
the map. The third row represents ab and has been encircled. The mid-
dle four squares represent bd and have been encircled. Then we look
for any two adjacent 1s. The bottom two squares of the second col-
umn represent a ¯cd. As all the 1s have now been included we know that
ab+bd+a ¯cd is a minimization of the expression. This is implemented in
Figure 4.13.

Example 4.12
To display the digits 0–9, a seven-segment light emitting
diode (LED) display may be used as shown in Figure 4.14. The various
states may be represented using a four-variable digital circuit. The logic
control signals for the lamp drivers are given by the truth table given in
Table 4.6. The X indicates a ‘don’t care’ condition in the truth table. The
column for the segment labelled p can be copied into a Karnaugh map as
given in Figure 4.15. Wherever a 1 appears in the truth table representa-
tion for p there is a 1 copied to the Karnaugh map. Similarly, the 0s and
the ‘don’t care’ crosses are copied. Minimize the Boolean expression for
p using the Karnaugh map.

two rows are encircled giving the term a. Now we look for groups of four.
The central four squares represent bd and the third column represents
cd. Finally, we can count the four corner squares as adjacent. This is
because two squares may be considered as adjacent if they are located
symmetrically with respect to any of the lines which divide the Karnaugh
map into equal halves, quarters, or eighths. This means that squares that
could be curled round to meet each other, as if the Karnaugh map where
drawn on a cylinder, are considered adjacent and also the four corner
squares. Here, the four corner squares represent the term ¯b ¯d. Hence, the
minimization for p gives
p = a + cd + bd + ¯b ¯d.
4.5 Summary
(1)
An algebra is a set with operations deﬁned on it. A binary operation
as a way of combining two elements of the set to result in another
element of the set. A unary operation has only one input element
producing one output.
(2)
ABooleanalgebrahastheoperationsofAND,OR,andNOTdeﬁned
on it and obeys the set of laws given in Section 4.3 as (B1)–(B10).
Examples of a Boolean algebra are: the set of sets in some universal
set E, with the operations of ∩, ∪and ′; the set of propositions with
the operations of ∧, ∨, and ¬; the set {0, 1} with the operations ‘.’
+, and −.
(3)
Logic circuits can be represented as Boolean expressions. Usually,
a high voltage is represented by 1 or TRUE and a low voltage by
0 or FALSE. There are three basic gates to represent the operators
AND (.), OR (+), and NOT (−).
(4)
A Boolean expression may be minimized by ﬁrst expressing it as a
sum of products and then using a Karnaugh map to combine terms.

Trigonometric
functions and
waves
5.1 Introduction
Waves occur naturally in a number of situations: the movement of dis-
turbed water, the passage of sound through the air, vibrations of a plucked
string. If the movement of a particular particle is plotted against time, then
we get the distinctive wave shape, called a sinusoid. The mathematical
expression of a wave is found by using the trigonometric functions, sine
and cosine. In Chapter 6 of the Background Mathematics Notes on the
companion website for this book we looked at right angled triangles and
deﬁned the trigonometric ratios. The maximum angle in a right angled
triangle is 90◦so to ﬁnd the trigonometric functions, sin(t), cos(t), and
tan(t) where t can be extended over the real numbers, we need a new
way of deﬁning them. This we do by using a rotating rod. Usually the
function will be used to relate, for instance, the height of the rod to time.
Therefore, it does not always make sense to think of the input to the cosine
and sine functions as being an angle. This problem is overcome by using
a new measure for the angle called the radian, which easily relates the
angle to the distance travelled by the tip of the rotating rod.
Waves may interfere with each other, as for instance on a plucked
string, where the disturbance bounces off the ends producing a standing
wave. Amplitude modulation of, for instance, radio waves, works by the
superposition of a message on a higher signal frequency. These situations
require an understanding of what happens when two, or more cosine or
sine functions are added, subtracted, or multiplied and hence we also
study trigonometric identities.
5.2
Trigonometric
functions and
radians
Consider a rotating rod of length 1. Imagine, for instance, that it is a
position marked on a bicycle tyre at the tip of one of the spokes, as the
bicycle travels along. The distance travelled by the tip of the rod in 1
complete revolution is 2π (the circumference of the circle of radius 1).
The height of the rod (measured from the centre of the wheel), y, can be
plotted against the distance travelled by the tip as in Figure 5.1.
Similarly, the position to the right or left of the origin, x, can be
plotted against the distance travelled by the tip of the rod as in Figure 5.2.
Figure 5.1 deﬁnes the function y = sin(t) and Figure 5.2 deﬁnes the
function x = cos(t).
This deﬁnition of the trigonometric function is very similar to that
used for the ratios in the triangle, if the hypotenuse is of length 1 unit.
The deﬁnitions become the same for angles up to a right angle if radians

are used as a measure of the angle in the triangle instead of degrees.
Insteadof360◦makingacompleterevolution2π radiansmakeacomplete
revolution. Some examples of degree to radian conversion are given in
Figure 5.3.
To convert degrees to radians use the fact that 360◦is the same as 2π
radians or equivalently that 180◦is the same as π radians. Hence, to
convert degrees to radians multiply by π/180 and to convert radians to
degrees multiply by 180/π.
Remember that π is approximately 3.1416 so these conversions can
be expressed approximately as: to convert degrees to radians multiply
by 0.01745 (i.e. 1◦≈0.01745 radians) and to convert radians to degrees
multiply by 57.3 (i.e. 1 radian ≈57.3◦).
Example 5.1

Express 45◦in radians.
Multiply 45 by π/180 giving π/4 ≈0.785. Hence, 45◦
≈
0.785 radians.
(b)

Multiply 17 by π/180 giving 17π/180 ≈0.297. Hence 17◦≈

Multiply120byπ/180 giving2π/3 ≈2.094. Hence, 120◦≈2.094.
(d)
Express 2 radians in degrees.
Multiply 2 by 180/π giving 114.6. Hence, 2 radians ≈114.6◦.
(e)
Express (5π/6) radians in degrees.
Multiply 5π/6 by 180/π giving 150. Hence, (5π/6) radians =
150◦.

(f)
Express 0.5 radians in degrees.
Multiply 0.5 by 180/π giving 28.6. Hence, 0.5 radians ≈28.6◦.
The trigonometric functions can also be deﬁned using a rotating rod of
length r as in Figure 5.4.
Figure 5.4
The
trigonometric functions
deﬁned in terms of a rotating
rod of length r.
The function values are given by:
cos(α) = x
r ,
sin(α) = y
r ,
tan(α) = y
x = sin(α)
cos(α)
Also
sec(α) =
1
cos(α),
cosec(α) =
1
sin(α),
cot(α) =
1
tan(α)
where α is measured in radians (one complete revolution is 2π radians).
Notice that the deﬁnitions are exactly the same as the trigonometric
ratios, where r is the hypotenuse and x and y are the adjacent and opposite
sides to the angle, except that x and y can now take both positive and
negative values and the angles can be as big as we like or negative (if the
rod rotates clockwise):
cos(α) =
adjacent
hypotenuse
sin(α) =
opposite
hypotenuse
tan(α) = opposite
adjacent
To get the correct function values from the calculator, it should be in
‘radian’ mode. However, by custom, engineers often use degrees, so we
will use the convention that if the ‘units’ are not speciﬁed then radians
must be used and for the input to be in degrees that must be expressly
marked, for example cos(30◦).
Important relationship between the
sine and the cosine
From Pythagoras’s theorem, looking at the diagram in Figure 5.4, we
have x2 + y2 = r2. Dividing both sides by r2 we get:
x2
r2 + y2
r2 = 1
and using the deﬁnitions of
cos(α) = x
r
and
sin(α) = y
r
we get
(cos(α))2 + (sin(α))2 = 1
and this is written in shorthand as
cos2(α) + sin2(α) = 1
where cos2(α) means (cos(α))2.

5.3 Graphs and
important
properties
We can now draw graphs of the functions for all input values t as in
Figures 5.5–5.7.
These are all important examples of periodic functions. To show that
the cos(t) or sin(t) function is periodic, translate the graph to the left or
right by 2π. The resulting graph will ﬁt exactly on top of the original
untranslated graph. 2π is called the fundamental period as translating
by 4π, 6π, 8π, etc. also results in the graph ﬁtting exactly on top of
the original function. The fundamental period is deﬁned as the smallest
period that has this property and all other periods are multiples of the
fundamental period. This periodic property can be expressed using a
letter, n, to represent any integer, giving
sin(t + 2πn) = sin(t)
cos(t + 2πn) = cos(t)
Figure 5.5
The graph of y = sin(t), where t can take any value.
Notice that the function repeats itself every 2π. This shows that the
function is periodic with period 2π. Notice also that the value of sin(t)
is never more than 1 and never less than −1. The function is odd as
sin(−t) = −sin(t).
Figure 5.6
The graph of x = cos(t), where t can take any value.
Notice that the function repeats itself every 2π. This shows that the
function is periodic with period 2π. Notice also that the value of cos(t)
is never more than 1 and never less than −1. The function is even as
cos(−t) = cos(t).
Figure 5.7
The graph of
z = tan(t), where t can take
any value except odd
multiples of π/2 (for instance
tan(t) is not deﬁned for
t = π/2, 3π/2, 5π/2). Notice
that the function repeats itself
every π. This shows that the
function is periodic with
period π. The function values
extend from −∞to ∞, that is,
the range of tan(t) is all the
real numbers. The function is
odd as tan(−t) = −tan(t).
TLFeBOOK

92
Trigonometric functions and waves
That is, adding or subtracting any multiple of 2π from the value of t gives
the same value of the functions x = cos(t) and y = sin(t).
The other important thing to remember about cos(t) and sin(t) is that
although the domain of the functions is all the real numbers, the function
values themselves lie between −1 and +1
−1 ⩽cos(t) ⩽1
−1 ⩽sin(t) ⩽1.
We say that the functions are bounded by −1 and +1 or, in other words,
the range of the cosine and sine functions is [−1, 1].
z = tan(t) has fundamental period π. If the graph is translated by
π to the left or right, then the resulting graph will ﬁt exactly on top of
the original graph. This periodic property can be expressed using n to
represent any integer, giving
tan(t + πn) = tan(t).
The values of tan(t) are not bounded. We can also say that −∞<
tan(t) < ∞.
Symmetry
Other important properties of these functions are the symmetry of the
functions. cos(t) is even, while sin(t) and tan(t) are odd. Unlike the
terms odd and even when used to describe numbers, not all functions
are either odd or even, most are neither. To show that cos(t) is even,
reﬂect the graph along the vertical axis. The resulting graph is exactly the
same as the original graph. This shows that swapping positive t values
for negative ones has no difference on the function values, that is,
cos(−t) = cos(t).
Other examples of even functions were given in Chapter 2 and the
general property of even functions was given there as f (t) = f (−t). The
functions sine and tangent are odd. If they are reﬂected along the vertical
axis then the resulting graph is an upside down version of the original.
This shows that swapping positive t values for negative ones gives the
negative of the original function. This property can be expressed by
sin(−t) = −sin(t)
tan(−t) = −tan(t).
For a general function, y = f (t), the property of being odd can be
expressed by f (−t) = −f (t).
The relationships between
the sine and cosine
Take the graph of sin(t) and translate it to the left by 90◦or π/2 and
we get the graph of cos(t). Equivalently, take the graph of cos(t) and
translate it to the right by π/2 and we get the graph of sin(t). Using the

Figure 5.8
(a) sin(α) = a/r
and cos(90◦−α) = a/r. Then
cos(90◦−α) = sin(α). As the
cosine is an even function
cos(90◦−α) =
cos(−(90◦−α)) = cos(α−90◦)
which conﬁrms that
cos(α −90◦) = sin(α).
cos(α) = b/r and
sin(90◦−α) = b/r, so
cos(α) = sin(90◦−α).
From Pythagoras theorem we also have that
a2 + b2 = r2,
dividing both sides by r2 we get
a2
r2 + b2
r2 = 1,
and using the deﬁnitions of sin(α) = a/r and cos(α) = b/r, we get
cos2(α) + sin2(α) = 1.
Rearranging this, we have cos2(α) = 1 −sin2(α) or sin2(α) = 1 −
cos2(α).
Example 5.2
Given sin(A) = 0.5 and 0 ⩽A ⩽90◦, use trigonometric
identities to ﬁnd:
(a)
cos(A)
(b)
sin(90◦−A)
(c)
cos(90◦−A).
Solution
(a)
Using cos2(A) = 1 −sin2(A) and sin(A) = 0.5
⇒
cos2(A) = 1 −(0.5)2 = 0.75
⇔
cos(A) ≈±0.866.
As A is between 0◦and 90◦, the cosine must be positive giving
cos(A) ≈0.866.

As sin(90◦−A) = cos(A), sin(90◦−A) ≈0.866.

is drawn, and has a peak value of 0.5 and a trough value of −0.5. There-
fore, the amplitude is half the difference: (0.5 −(−0.5))/2 = 0.5. The
period, or cycle length, is the minimum amount the graph needs to be
shifted to the left or right (excluding no shift) in order to ﬁt over the origi-
nal graph. In this case the period is 0.4. The phase is found by ﬁnding the
proportion of the cycle that the graph has been shifted to the left. In this
case the proportion of shift is 1/4. Now multiply that by a standard cycle
length of 2π to give the phase angle of π/2. The cycle rate is the number of
cycles in unit length given by the reciprocal of the period = 1/0.4 = 2.5.

Continued.
In Figure 5.11(b) y = 3 cos(2x −1), has a peak value of 3 and a
trough value of −3. Therefore, the amplitude is half the difference =
(3 −(−3))/2 = 3. The period is the minimum amount the graph needs
to be shifted to the left or right (excluding no shift) in order to ﬁt over
the original graph. In this case the period is π. The phase is found by
ﬁnding the proportion of the cycle that the graph has been shifted to the
left. In this case the proportion of shift is −0.5/π. Now multiply that by
a standard cycle length of 2π to give the phase angle of −1. The cycle
rate is the number of cycles in unit length given by the reciprocal of the
period 1/π ≈0.32.
We can generalize from these examples to say that for the function
y = A cos(ax + b), A positive, we have the following.
The amplitude is half the difference between the function values at the
peak and the trough of the wave and in case where y = A cos(ax + b) is
given by A.

The fundamental period, P, or cycle length is the smallest, non-zero,
distance that the graph can be shifted to the right or left so that it lies on top
of the original graph. This can be found by looking for two consecutive
values where the function takes its maximum value, that is when the
cosine takes the value 1. Using the fact that cos(0) = 1 and cos(2π) = 1,
cos(ax + b) becomes cos(0) when ax + b = 0 ⇔x = −b/a
cos(ax + b) becomes cos(2π) when ax + b = 2π ⇔x = 2π/a −b/a
and the difference between them is 2π/a; giving the fundamental period
of the function cos(ax + b) as 2π/a.

(a) y = cos(5πx + (π/2)); (b) y = 3 cos(2x −1).
The phase is given by the number, b, in the expression A cos(ax + b).
The phase is related to the amount the function A cos(ax + b) is shifted
to the left or right with respect to the function A cos(ax). It expresses the
proportion of a standard cycle (maximum 2π) that the graph has been
shifted by and therefore a phase can always be expressed between 0 and
2π or more often between −π and π. Various phase shifts are given in
Figure 5.12.
The cycle rate or frequency is the number of cycles in one unit can be
found by relating this to the length of the cycle. The longer the cycle the
less cycles there will be in one unit. If the length of one cycle is P (the
fundamental period) then there is 1 cycle in P units and 1/P cycles in
1 unit.
The cycle rate is the reciprocal of the fundamental period. As for the
function y = A cos(ax + b) the fundamental period is P = 2π/a, the
number of cycles is 1/P, that is, a/2π. Examples are given in Figure 5.13.
5.4 Wave
functions of
time and
distance
A wave allows energy to be transferred from one point to another without
any particles of the medium moving between the two points. Water waves
move along the surface of a pond in response to a child rhythmically
splashing a hand in the water. The child’s boat ﬂoating in the path of the
wave merely bobs up and down without moving in the direction of the
wave. See Figure 5.14.
If we look at the position of the boat as the wave passes, it moves
up and down with the height expressed against time giving a sinusoidal
function. This is then a wave function of time and in the expression
y = A cos(ωt + φ), the letter A represents the amplitude, φ represents
the phase, and ω is related to the wave frequency. This is explained in
detail in the next section. If we take a snapshot picture of the surface of

proportion that the phase, π/3, represents of a standard cycle of 2π). (d) y = cos(πx +π) has phase of π and

the water at a particular point in time then we will also get a wave shape
where we now have an graph of the height of the water expressed against
the distance from the waves origin. In this case where y = A cos(kx+φ),
A still represents the amplitude, φ the phase but the coefﬁcient of x, k,
is now related to the wavelength. Ideally, we want an expression that
can give the height, y, at any position x at any time t. This function is
called the progressive wave function and we can combine the two ideas
of waves as a function of time and distance to obtain an expression for
this function.

Trigonometric functions and waves
Sinusoidal functions of time:
amplitude, frequency, angular
frequency, period, and phase
Waves that represent a displacement from a central ﬁxed position varying
with time can be represented by an expression such as y= A cos(ωt+φ) or
y = A sin(ωt+φ), where t is in seconds. Examples include an alternating
voltage measured across a particular circuit element or the position of the
centre of an ear drum as it vibrates in response to a pure sound wave.
As we saw in the previous section, A represents the wave amplitude, ω
(the Greek letter, omega) is called the angular frequency as it gives the
number of cycles in 2π, it is measured in radians per second. The number
of cycles in 1 s is called the frequency, f = ω/2π and is measured in hertz
(Hz). φ (the Greek letter, phi) is the phase, the cycle length is 2π/ω s. In
the case of a function of time the cycle length is called the periodic time
or just the period and we often use the greek letter, τ (tau), to represent
this, where τ = 2π/ω. Then we have that y = A cos(ωt + φ) can be
rewritten as
y = A cos(2πf t + φ)
using the frequency. As f = 1/τ, this can be written as
y = A cos
2π
τ t + φ

Example 5.5
(a)
y = 3 cos(t + 1); ﬁnd the amplitude, frequency, period, angular
frequency, and phase where t is expressed in seconds.
Compare y = 3 cos(t + 1) with y = A cos(ωt + φ). Then we can see
that the angular frequency ω = 1, the phase φ = 1, and the amplitude
A = 3. As the frequency, f = ω/2π, f = 1/2π, and the period τ =
1/f = 1/(1/2π) = 2π s.
(b)
V = 12 cos(314t + 1.6); ﬁnd the amplitude, frequency, period,
angular frequency, and phase where t is expressed in seconds.
Compare V = 12 cos(314t + 1.6) with V = A cos(ωt + φ). Then
the angular frequency, ω = 314, the phase φ = 1.6, and the amplitude
A = 12. As f = ω/2π, f = 314/2π ≈50 Hz, and the period τ =
1/f = 1/50 = 0.02 s.
Sinusoidal functions of distance:
amplitude, cycle rate, wavelength,
and phase
Waves that give the displacement from a central ﬁxed position of vari-
ous different points at a ﬁxed moment in time can be represented by an
expression such as y = A cos(kx+φ) or y = A sin(kx+φ), where x is in
metres. Examples include the position of a vibrating string at a particular
moment or the surface of pond in response to a disturbance. As we saw
in the previous section, A represents the wave amplitude; k is called the
wavenumber and represents the number cycles in 2π. The spatial fre-
quency gives the number of cycles in 1 m (= k/2π). The cycle length
TLFeBOOK

Trigonometric functions and waves
101
is called the wavelength and we often use the greek letter λ (lambda), to
represent this. The phase is φ.
The expression for y can be written, using the wavelength, as
y = A cos
2π
λ x + φ

.
Example 5.6
(a)
y = 4 cos(x + 0.5); ﬁnd the amplitude, wavelength, wavenumber,
spatial frequency, and phase where x is expressed in metres.
Compare y = 4 cos(x + 0.5) with y = A cos(kx + φ). Then the
wavenumber k = 1, the phase = 0.5, and the amplitude A = 4. As
spatial frequency = k/2π, this gives 1/2π wavelengths per metre and the
wavelength λ = 2π/k = 2π/1 = 2π m.
(b)
y = 2 sin(2πx); ﬁnd the amplitude, wavelength, wavenumber,
spatial frequency, and phase where x is expressed in metres.
Using sin(θ) = cos(θ −(π/2)), we get 2 sin(2πx) = cos(2πx −
(π/2)). Compare y = cos(2πx −(π/2)) with y = A cos(kx + φ). We
can see that the wavenumber k = 2π, φ the phase = −π/2, and the
amplitude A = 2. As spatial frequency = k/2π, this gives 1 wavelength
per metre, and the wavelength λ = 2π/k = 2π/2π = 1 m.
Waves in time and space
The two expressions for a wave function of time and space can be
combined as
y = A cos(ωt −kx)
and this is called a progressive wave equation. The −sign is used to give
a wavefront travelling from left to right and t should be taken as positive
with ωt ⩾kx.
Notice that if we look at the movement of a particular point by ﬁxing
x, then we replace x by x0 and this just gives a function of time, y =
A cos(ωt + φ) where φ = −kx0.
If we look at the wave at a single moment in time, then we ﬁx time
and replace t by t0 and this just gives a function of distance x, y =
A cos(kx + φ) where φ = −ωt0.
Waves are of two basic types. Mechanical waves need a medium
through which to travel, for example, sound waves, water waves, and
seismic waves. Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum, for
example, light rays, X-rays. In all cases where they can be expressed as
a progressive or travelling wave, the frequency, wavelength, etc. can be
found from the expression of the wave in the same way.
Figure 5.15 shows three snapshot pictures of the progressive wave
y = cos(15t −3x) at t = 0, t = 2, and t = 5. This wave has angular
frequency ω = 15, and wavenumber, k = 3 and therefore the frequency
f is 2π/15 and the wavelength λ = 2π/3. By considering the amount
the wavefront moves in a period of time, we are able to ﬁnd the wave
velocity.

3x < 15t, y = 0 otherwise. (a) No wave at t = 0; (b) t = 2 gives y = cos(30 −3x) = cos(3x −30) for
3x < 30, that is, x < 10; (c) t = 5 gives y = cos(75 −3x) = cos(3x −75) for 3x < 75, that is, x < 25.
Notice that the wavefront has moved 25 m in 5 s giving a velocity of 25/5 = 5 m s−1.
Velocity of a progressive wave
The progressive wave y = A cos(ωt −kx) vibrates f times per second
and the length of each cycle, the wavelength, is λ. In which case the
wavefront must move through a distance of λf metres per second and
hence the velocity v is given by
v = f λ
where f = ω/2π and λ = 2π/k; hence, v = ω/k.
Example 5.7

Figure 5.16 and is given by the function y = 2 cos(6.28t −1.57r) where
t > 0 and 1.57r ⩽6.28t. Find the frequency, periodic time, spatial
frequency, wavenumber, and wavelength.
The wave is pictured for t = 5 in Figure 5.16.
Solution
Comparing y = 2 cos(6.28t −1.57r) with y = A cos(ωt −kr)
gives A = 2, angular frequencyω = 6.28, wavenumber k = 1.57. Hence,
frequency f = ω/2π = 6.28/2π ≈1 Hz, periodic time τ = 1/f = 1 s,
spatial frequency = k/2π = 1.57/2π ≈1
4, wavelength λ = 2π/k =
2π/1.57 ≈4 m and velocity = f λ = 1 × 4 = 4 ms−1.

The concentric circles
represent the peak
amplitudes of the wave. The
wavefront has moved to
r = 20 at t = 5 giving a wave
velocity of 20/5 = 4 m s−1.
Measuring amplitudes – decibels
In Chapter 2 we looked at sound decay in a room and found that the
expression was exponential and could be expressed by using a power of
10. Because of this property of sound decay, and decay of other wave
forms, and also because of the need to have a unit which can be used
TLFeBOOK

Trigonometric functions and waves

easily to express relatively small quantities, decibels are often used to
represent wave amplitudes. In this case the measurement is always in
relation to some reference level.
Sound pressure is parallel in electronics to the voltage. The sound
pressure level is measured in decibels and is deﬁned as 20 log10(p/p0)
where p is the actual sound pressure and p0 the reference pressure in
N m−2. The reference pressure used is approximately the threshold of
audibility for sound at 1000 Hz and is given by
p0 = 2 × 10−5 N m−2.
Voltage, measured in decibels, is given by 20 log10(V /V0).
Sound intensity is parallel to power in a circuit. The sound intensity
level = 10 log10(I/I0) where I is the sound intensity and I0 is the sound
intensity at the threshold of audibility,
I0 = 10−12 W m−2.
Because the reference points used for the measurement of the amplitude
of sound are the same whether measuring the sound pressure level or the
sound intensity level measurement, of either, will give the same result on
the save wave.
Example 5.8
The sound generated by a car has intensity 2 ×
10−5 W m−2. Find the sound intensity level and sound pressure level.

Compound angle identities
It can often be useful to write an expression for, for instance, cos(A + B)
in terms of trigonometric ratios for A and B. A common mistake is
to assume that cos(A + B) = cos(A) + cos(B) but this can easily be

disproved. Take as an example A = 45◦, B = 45◦, then
cos(A + B) = cos(45◦+ 45◦) = cos(90◦) = 0,
cos(A) + cos(B) = cos(45◦) + cos(45◦) ≈0.707 + 0.707 = 1.414,
showing that
cos(A + B) = cos(A) + cos(B) is FALSE.
The correct expression is
cos(A + B) = cos(A) cos(B) −sin(A) sin(B).
The other compound angle identities are as follows:
sin(A + B) = sin(A) cos(B) + cos(A) sin(B)
tan(A + B) = tan(A) + tan(B)
1 −tan(A) tan(B).
Figure 5.17
sin(A + B) =
sin(A) cos(B) + cos(A) sin(B).
There are various ways of showing these to be true, in Figure 5.17
we show that sin(A + B) = sin(A) cos(B) + cos(A) sin(B) by using
a geometrical argument. Draw two triangles YZW and YWX so that
∠A and ∠B are adjacent angles and the two triangles are right angled as
shown. Draw the lines XX′ and YY′ so that they form right angles to each
other, as shown. Notice that ∠YXY′ is also ∠A. From △WX′X, sin(A +
B) = XX′/XW, and as X′Y′YZ is a rectangle then X′Y′ = ZY. So
sin(A + B) = XY′ + ZY

Looking at the triangles containing these sides we can see that this gives
sin(A + B) = sin(A) cos(B) + cos(A) sin(B).
A similar argument can be used for cos(A + B), and tan(A + B) is
usually found by using the expressions for sin(A + B), cos(A + B), and
the deﬁnition of the tangent in terms of A and B.
tan(A + B) = sin(A + B)
cos(A + B) = sin(A) cos(B) + cos(A) sin(B)
cos(A) cos(B) −sin(A) sin(B).
Divide the top and bottom lines by cos(A) cos(B), giving
tan(A + B) =
sin(A) cos(B)
cos(A) cos(B) + cos(A) sin(B)
cos(A) cos(B)
cos(A) cos(B)
cos(A) cos(B) −sin(A) sin(B)
cos(A) cos(B)
tan(A + B) = tan(A) + tan(B)
1 −tan(A) tan(B).
From these three identities for sin(A+B), cos(A+B), and tan(A+B)
we can obtain many other expressions. A list of important trigonometric
identities is given in Table 5.1.

Superposition
The principle of superposition of waves states that the effect of a number
of waves can be found by summing the disturbances that would have
been produced by the individual waves separately. This behaviour is quite
different from that of travelling particles, which will bump into each other,
thereby altering the velocity of both.
The idea of superposition is used to explain the behaviour of:
1.
stationary waves formed by two wave trains of the same amplitude
and frequency travelling at the same speed in opposite directions.
2.
Interference of coherent waves from identical sources.
3.
Two wave trains of close frequency travelling at the same speed,
causing beats.
4.
Diffraction effects.
We look at some examples of these applications.
Standing waves
Suppose that a wave is created by plucking a string of a musical instru-
ment; when the wave reaches the end of the string it is reﬂected back.
The reﬂected wave will have the same frequency as the initial wave but a
different phase and will be travelling in the opposite direction.
The sum of the incident and reﬂected wave forms a standing wave. An
example is shown in Figure 5.18. Figure 5.18(a) shows the incident wave
in a string at some instant in time. Its phase is 18◦. Beyond the barrier
is shown the hypothetical continuation of the wave as if there were no
barrier. The reﬂected wave is found by turning this section upside down
and reﬂecting it, as shown in Figure 5.18(b). The reﬂected wave has
phase (180◦−phase of the incident wave) = 180◦−18◦= 162◦. In
Figure 5.18(c), the sum of the incident and reﬂected wave produces a
standing wave. The maximum and minimum values on this are called
antinodes and the zero values are called nodes. As the string is ﬁxed at
both ends there must be nodes at the ends.
At different moments in time, the phase of the incident wave will be
different. This changes the amplitude of the standing wave but does not
change the position of the nodes or antinodes (for a given frequency of
wave). Only waves whose wavelengths exactly divide into 2l (twice the
length of the string) can exist on the string because their amplitude must
be 0 at the two end points. Each possible wavelength deﬁnes a mode of

vibration of the string. λ = 2l is called the fundamental mode and is
shown in Figure 5.19.
Figure 5.19
The
fundamental mode for a
standing wave in a string of
length ℓhas wavelength 2ℓso
that half a cycle ﬁts into the
length of the string. This is the
longest wavelength possible.
The standing wave can be explained using
cos(X) + cos(Y) = 2 cos 1
2(X + Y) cos 1
2(X −Y).
The example given in Figure 5.18 has a wavelength of 4 giving
wavenumber 360◦/4 = 90◦. The incident wave (phase 18◦) is y =
cos(90◦x + 18◦) and the reﬂected wave is y = cos(90◦x + 162◦).
Summing these gives
cos(90◦x + 18◦) + cos(90◦x + 162◦)
= 2 cos

2(90◦x + 18◦

= 2 cos(90◦x + 90◦) cos(72◦).
As a 90◦phase-shifted version of a cosine gives a negative sine, this gives
−2 cos(72◦) sin(90◦x). We see that the result is a sine wave of the same
spatial frequency as the incident and reﬂected wave but with an amplitude
of 2 cos 72◦≈0.62.
This result can also be found for a general situation – now expressing
the phases, etc. in radians. The initial wave is cos(kx+δ) and the reﬂected
wave is cos(kx + π −δ). The standing wave is given by summing these,

The standing wave has the same spatial frequency as the original waves.
As cos(kx +π/2) = −sin(kx) and cos(δ−π/2) = sin(δ), this becomes
−2 sin(kx) sin(δ). So, the instantaneous amplitude of the standing wave
is 2 sin(δ) where δ is the phase of the incident wave.
5.7 Inverse
trigonometric
functions
From the graphs of the trigonometric functions, y = sin(x), y = cos(x),
and y = tan(x), we notice that for any one value of y there are several
possible values of x. This means that there are no inverse functions if all
input values for x are allowed. However, we can see on a calculator that
there is a function listed above the sine button and marked as sin−1, so is
it in fact the inverse function?
Try the following with the calculator in degree mode. Enter 60 and
press sin, then press sin−1. This is shown in Table 5.2(a). The same
process is repeated for 120◦and for −120◦. However, for the latter two
cases the inverse function does not work.
If we can restrict the range of values allowed into sin(x) to the range
−90◦to +90◦, then sin−1(x) is a true inverse.
The inverse function of y = sin(x) is deﬁned as f (x) = sin−1(x)
(often written as arcsin(x) to avoid confusion with 1/ sin(x)). It is the
inverse function only if the domain of the sine function is limited to
−π/2 ⩽x ⩽π/2. Thus, sin−1(sin(x)) = x if x lies within the limits
given above and sin(sin−1(x)) = x if −1 ⩽x ⩽1. The graph of
y = sin−1(x) is given in Figure 5.20.
Figure 5.20
Graph of
y = sin−1(x).
f (x) = cos−1(x) is the inverse of y = cos(x) if the domain of cos(x)
is limited to 0 ⩽x ⩽π. cos−1(cos(x)) = x if x is limited to the interval
above and cos(cos−1(x)) = x if −1 ⩽x ⩽1. The graph of y = cos−1(x)
is given in Figure 5.21.
Figure 5.21
Graph of
y = cos−1(x).
f (x) = tan−1(x) is the inverse of y = tan(x) if the domain of tan(x)
is limited to −π/2 < x < π/2. Thus, tan−1(tan(x)) = x if x is limited
as above and tan(tan−1(x)) = x for all x. The graph of y = tan−1(x) is
given in Figure 5.22.

5.8 Solving the
trigonometric
equations
sin x = a,
cos x = a,
tan x = a
The solutions to the equations sin(x) = a, cos(x) = a, and tan(x) = a
are shown in Figures 5.23–5.25, respectively. Where the lines y = a cross
the sine, cosine, or tangent graph gives the solutions to the equations. In
Figure 5.23, solutions to sin(x) = a are given by values of x where
the line y = a crosses the graph y = sin(x). Notice that there are two
solutions in every cycle. The ﬁrst solution is sin−1(a) and the second is
given by π −sin−1(a). Solutions in the other cycles can be found by
adding a multiple of 2π to these two solutions.
In Figure 5.24, solutions to cos(x) = a are given by values of x where
the line y = a crosses the graph y = cos(x). Notice that there are two
solutions in every cycle. The two solutions in [−π, π] are cos−1(a) and
−cos−1(a). Other solutions can be found by adding a multiple of 2π to
these two solutions.
In Figure 5.25, solutions to tan(x) = a are given by values of x where
the line y = a crosses the graph y = tan(x). Notice there is one solution
in every cycle. The solution in [0, π] is tan−1(a). Solutions in the other
cycles can be found by adding a multiple of π to this solution.

cross. The solution nearest x = 0 is given by sin−1(0.5) ≈0.524. The
other solution in [0, 2π] is given by π −0.524 ≈2.62. Any multiple of
2π added on to these solutions will also give a solution. Therefore, in the
range [2π, 4π] the solutions are 3.64 and 8.9.
Example 5.15
Find solutions to cos(x)

0.3 in the range
[−480◦, 480◦].
Solution
From the graph of y = cos(x) and the line y = 0.3 in
Figure 5.27, the solutions can be worked out from where the two lines
cross. The solution nearest x = 0 is given by cos−1(0.3) ≈73◦. The
other solution in [0◦, 360◦] is given by −73◦. Any multiple of 360◦
added on to these solutions will also give a solution. Therefore, in the
range [−480◦, 480◦] the solutions are −433◦, −287◦, −73◦, 73◦, 287◦,
and 433◦(approximately).
Example 5.16
Find solutions to tan(x) = 0.1 in the range [360◦, 540◦].
Solution
From the graph of y = tan(x) and the line y = 0.1 in
Figure 5.28, the solutions can be worked out from where the two lines
cross. The solution nearest x = 0 is given by tan−1(0.1) ≈6◦. Any mul-
tiple of π added on to this solution will also give a solution. Therefore,
in the range [360◦, 540◦] there is only one solution, that is, 366◦.
5.9 Summary
1.
Trigonometric functions can be deﬁned using a rotating rod of
length 1. The sine is given by plotting the height of the tip of the
rod against the distance travelled. The cosine is given by plotting the
position that the tip of the rod is to the left or right of the origin against
the distance travelled. Hence, if the tip of the rod is at point (x, y) and
the tip has travelled a distance of t units, then sin(t) = y, cos(t) = x,
and the tangent is given by
tan(t) = sin(t)
cos(t) = y
x .
2.
If angles are measured in radians, then this deﬁnition is the same
for angles between 0 and π/2 as that given by deﬁning the cosine,
sine, and tangent from the sides of a triangle (of hypotenuse 1) as

The trigonometric ratios can now be deﬁned using a rotating rod

α is normally expressed in radians, although engineers often use
degrees. If degrees are intended, then they must be explicitly marked.
3.
sin(t) and tan(t) are odd functions, while cos(t) is an even function.
This can be expressed by
sin(−t) = −sin(t)
cos(−t) = cos(t)
tan(−t) = −tan(t)
sin(t) and cos(t) are periodic with period 2π and tan(t) is periodic
with period π. This can be expressed by
sin(t + 2πn) = sin(t)
cos(t + 2πn) = cos(t)
tan(t + πn) = tan(t)
where n ∈Z.

the progressive wave equation and has velocity v = λf m s−1.

Wave amplitudes are often measured on a logarithmic scale using
decibels.
6.
There are many trigonometric identities, summarized on Table 5.1.
Some of the more fundamental ones are:
cos(A ± B) = cos(A) cos(B) ∓sin(A) sin(B)
sin(A ± B) = sin(A) cos(B) ± cos(A) sin(B)
tan(A) = sin(A)
cos(A)
cos2(A) + sin2(A) = 1
from which others can be derived.
7.
The principle of superposition of waves gives that the effect of a
number of waves can be found by summing the disturbances that
would have been produced by the waves separately. One applica-
tion of this is the case of stationary waves, which can be explained
mathematically using trigonometric identities.
8.
sin−1(x) is the inverse function to sin(x) if the domain of sin(x) is
limited to −π/2 ⩽x ⩽π/2, in which case sin−1(sin(x)) = x.
cos−1(x) is the inverse function to cos(x) if the domain of cos(x)
is limited to 0 ⩽x ⩽π, in which case cos−1(cos(x)) = x.
tan−1(x) is the inverse function to tan(x) if the domain of tan(x)
is limited to −π/2 < x < π/2, in which case tan−1(tan(x)) = x.

Inverse trigonometric functions are used in solving trigonometric
equations. There are many solutions to trigonometric equations and
graphs can be used to help see where the solutions lie.
sin(x) = a has two solutions: one is x = sin−1(a) and another is
π −sin−1(a). Other solutions can be found by adding or subtracting
a multiple of 2π.
cos(x) = a has two solutions: one is x = cos−1(a) and another is
−cos−1(a). Other solutions can be found by adding or subtracting a
multiple of 2π.
tan(x) = a has one solution: x = tan−1(a). Other solutions can
be found by adding or subtracting a multiple of π.

Differentiation
6.1 Introduction
We have used functions to express relationships between variables. For
instance, in an electrical circuit the current and the voltage through a
resistor can be related by V = IR. Here, one physical relationship can
be found by simply substituting in the formula the known value of the
other. Another common relationship between physical quantities is that
one quantity is the rate of change of another: for instance, speed is deﬁned
as rate of change of distance with respect to time. It is simple to ﬁnd the
average speed of a moving object if we know how far it has travelled in a
certain length of time, which is given by
Distance travelled
Time taken
This does not give an idea of the speed at any particular instant. If
I am travelling by coach from London to Birmingham the journey takes
about 2.75 h to go about 110 miles. This means that the average speed
is about 40 mph. However, I know that the coach by no means travels at
a constant speed. Through central London it travels at around 12 mph
and on the motorway at around 70 mph. Is there a way that we can
estimate the speed at any particular moment as accurately as possible,
armed only with a mileometer, to give the distance travelled, and a stop
watch? I can measure the distance travelled in a 10 s interval and ﬁnd
that it is 0.2 miles. This means that the average speed is 0.2/10 miles per
second = 0.02 miles per second = 0.02 × 60 × 60 mph = 72 mph.
This gives a pretty good idea of the speed at any moment within that
10 s interval, as the length of time is small enough that the speed prob-
ably has not changed too much. The smaller the period of time over
which we take the measurement, the more accurately we should be
able to estimate the speed at any one instant. The speed is found by
looking at the ratio of the distance travelled over the time taken where
the time interval is taken as small as possible. This is an approxi-
mation to the instantaneous rate of change of distance with respect
to time.
The rate of change of one quantity with respect to another is called
its derivative. If we know the expression deﬁning the function then we
are able to ﬁnd its derivative. The techniques used for differentiating are
described in this chapter.
Many physical quantities are related through differentiation. Some
of these are current and charge, acceleration and velocity, force and
work done, momentum and force, and power and energy. Applica-
tions of differentiation are, therefore, very widespread in all areas of
engineering.

6.2 The average
rate of change
and the gradient
of a chord
A ball is thrown from the ground and after t s is at a distance s m from
the ground, where
s = 20t −5t2
Find:
(a)
the average velocity of the ball between t = 1 s and t = 1.1 s;
(b)
the average velocity between t = 1 and t = 1.01 s;
(c)
the average velocity between t = 1 and t = 1.001 s;
(d)
the average velocity between t = 1 and t = 1.0001 s;
Guess the velocity at t = 1.
Solution
The average velocity is given by the distance moved divided
by the time taken. That can be represented by
Average velocity = change in distance
change in time
= δs
δt = s(t2) −s(t1)
t2 −t1
where t2 and t1 are the times between which we are ﬁnding the average.
δs (‘delta s’) is used to represent a change in s and δt (‘delta t’) is used
to represent a change in t. The average velocity δs/δt = ‘delta s over
delta t’.
So, to solve this problem we can use a table, as given in Table 6.1.
The graph of this function is given in Figure 6.1. If a line that joins
two points lying on the graph of the function it is drawn it is called a
chord. We found that when t = 1 and s = 15 the point (1, 15) lies on
the graph. When t = 1.1 and s = 15.95 we can also mark the point

Differentiation
(1.1, 15.95). The triangle containing the chord joining these two points
has height δs = change in s = 15.95 −15 = 0.95 and base length δt =
change in t = 1.1 −1.0 = 0.1. This means that the gradient = δs/δt =
0.95/0.1 = 9.5. Another chord can be drawn from t = 1 to t = 1.01.
When t = 1.01 and s = 15.0995 we mark the point (1.01, 15.0995).
The triangle containing the chord joining (1, 15) to (1.01, 15.0995) has
height δs = change in s = 15.0995 −15 = 0.0995 and base length
δt = change in t = 1.01 −1.0 = 0.1. This means that the gradient =
δs/δt = 0.0995/0.01 = 9.95.
As the ends of the chord are put nearer together the gradient of the chord
gives a very good approximation to the instantaneous rate of change.
Unfortunately, the chord becomes so small that we can hardly see it! To
get round this problem we can extend the line at either end. So a chord
between two points that are very close together appears to only just touch
the function curve. A line that just touches at one point is called a tangent.
As the two points on the chord approach each other the line of the chord
approaches the tangent. Therefore, the gradient of the chord must also
give a good approximation to the gradient of the tangent.
We can guess from Table 6.1 that the instantaneous velocity at t = 1
is 10 m s−1. Although the length of time over which we take the average
gets smaller and smaller, that is, tends towards zero, the average veloc-
ity does not get nearer to zero but instead approaches the value of the
instantaneous velocity.
The instantaneous velocity is represented by ds/dt, the derivative of s
with respect to t, and can deﬁned using
Instantaneous velocity = ds
dt = lim
δt→0
δs
δt
read as ‘ds by dt equals the limit, as delta t tends to zero, of delta s over
delta t’.
Note that ds/dt is read as ‘ds by dt’ (not ‘ds over dt’) because the line
between the ds and the dt does not mean ‘divided by’. However, because
it does represent a rate of change it usually ‘works’ to treat ds/dt like
a fractional expression. This is because we can always approximate the
instantaneous rate of change by the average rate of change (which is a
fraction)
ds
dt ≈δs
δt
for small δt
‘ds by dt is approximately delta s over delta t for small delta t’.
δs/δt represents the gradient of a chord and ds/dt represents the gra-
dient of the tangent. If δs/δt is used as an approximation to ds/dt then
we are using the chord to approximate the tangent.
6.3 The
derivative
function
We saw in Section 6.2 that if the ends of the chord are put closer together
the gradient of the chord approaches the gradient of a tangent. The tangent
to a curve is a line that only touches the curve at one point. The gradient
of the tangent is also more simply referred to as the slope of the curve at
that point. If the slope of the curve is found for every point on the curve
then we get the derivative function.

The derivative of a function, y = f (x) is deﬁned as
dy
dx = lim
δx→0
δy
δx
provided that this limit exists. As δy is the change in y and y = f (x)
then, at the points x and x + δx, y has values f (x) and f (x + δx), the
increase in y is given by δy = f (x + δx) −f (x). We have
dy
dx = lim δy
δx = lim
δx→0
f (x + δx) −f (x)
δx
.
The derivative of y = f (x), dy/dx, ‘dy by dx’ can also be represented
as f ′(x) (read as ‘f dashed of x’). f ′(a) is the gradient of the tangent to
the curve f (x) at the point x = a. This is found by ﬁnding the gradient
of the chord between two points at x = a + δx and x = a and taking the
limit as δx tends to zero.
The gradient of a chord gives the average rate of change of a function
over an interval and the gradient of the tangent, the derivative, gives the
instantaneous rate of change of the function at a point. These deﬁnitions
are shown in Figure 6.2.
Derivative functions can be found by evaluating the limit shown in
Figure 6.2. This is called differentiating from ﬁrst principles.
Figure 6.2
The gradient of the chord δy/δx approaches the gradient of the tangent (or the slope of the
curve) as the ends of the chord get closer together (i.e. δx tends to zero). This is written as
dy
dx = lim
δx→0
δy
δx
read as ‘dy by dx equals the limit, as the change in x (delta x) tends to zero, of the change in y (delta y)
divided by the change in x (delta x)’.

Example 6.1
If y = x2 ﬁnd dy/dx using
dy
dx = lim
δx→0
δy
δx
Solution
Consider a small change so that x goes from x to x + δx. As
y = x2 we can ﬁnd the function value at x + δx by replacing x by x + δx
giving y + δy = (x + δx)2. Therefore, the change in y, δy, is given by
(x + δx)2 −x2 = x2 + 2xδx + (δx)2 −x2 = 2xδx + (δx)2
Therefore,
δy
δx = 2xδx + (δx)2
δx
As long as δx does not actually equal 0 we can divide the top and bottom
line by δx giving
δy
δx = 2x + δx
and therefore
dy
dx = lim
δx→0 2x + δx = 2x
This has shown that
y = x2 ⇒dy
dx = 2x.
6.4 Some

giving, for instance,

dx (xn) = nxn−1
This can be read as ‘the derivative of xn is nxn−1’ or ‘d by dx of xn is
nxn−1’.
To see the validity of a couple of entries in Table 6.2, refer to Figure 6.3

(a) The graph of
y = cos(x) with a few
tangents marked. On
travelling from left to right,
when we are going uphill the
slope (and therefore the
derivative) must be positive
and when going downhill the
derivative must be negative.
At the top of the hills and the
bottom of the troughs the
slope is 0. Joining up the
points on the bottom graph
gives something like an
upside-down sine wave.
(b) The graph of the derivative
dy/dx = −sin(x).
Solution
To differentiate a power of x we must ﬁrst write the expression
in the form xn where n is some number. We can then use the fact that
d
dx (xn) = nxn−1
from Table 6.2.
(a)
x = x1; therefore, n = 1. Substitute n = 1 in
d
dx (xn) = nxn−1
to give

Figure 6.5
A spring has a
weight hanging from it of
unknown mass m. The spring
extends by an amount x and
the energy stored in the
spring is known to be E = x 2.
The force due to gravity is
F = mg where g is the
acceleration due to gravity.
Example 6.3
The energy stored in a stretched spring of extension x m
is found to be E = x2 J (Figure 6.5). The force exerted by hanging
a weight on the spring is given by mg where g is the acceleration due
to gravity g ≈10 m s−1 and m is the mass. Given that the spring is
extended by 0.5 m and that F = dE/dx ﬁnd the mass hanging on the
spring.
Solution
Find the expression for the force by differentiating E = x2:
F = dE
dx = 2x
As x = 0.5, F = 2(0.5) = 1 N. Now, F = mg, and as g ≈10 then
1 = m × 10 ⇔m = 1
10 = 0.1 kg
Thus, the mass on the spring is 0.1 kg.
6.5 Finding the
derivative of
combinations of
functions
To ﬁnd the derivative of functions that are the sum, difference quotient,
product, or composite of any of the functions given in Table 6.2, we use
the entries given in Table 6.2 the rules given in this section.
Derivatives of af (x) where a is
a constant
d
dx (af (x)) = af ′(x)
This is only true if a is a constant, not if it is a function of x.

Example 6.4
Differentiate y = 2x3. Notice that this a constant, 2,
multiplied by x3. The derivative of x3 is found by looking Table 6.2. The
derivative of xn is given by nxn−1. In this case n = 3 so
d
dx (x3) = 3x2
and hence
dy
dx = 2(3x2) = 6x2
Derivatives of a sum (or a difference) of
functions
If y can be written as the sum of two functions, that is, y = u + v where
u and v are functions of x then
dy
dx = du
dx + dv
dx
Example 6.5
Differentiate y = sin(t) + √t.
Solution

Derivatives of composite functions
(function of a function)
If y = f (x) is a composite function, so that we can write y = h(u) where
u = g(x), then
dy
dx = dy
du
du
dx
This is called the chain rule.
Example 6.6
Differentiate y = sin(2x).
Solution
We can substitute u = 2x giving y = sin(u):
du
dx = 2
and
dy
du = cos(u).
Therefore,
dy
dx = dy
du
du
dx = 2 cos(u).
Finally, resubstitute for u giving
dy
dx = 2 cos(2x).
TLFeBOOK

124
Differentiation
Note that we always need to make substitutions so that our function is
the composite of the simple functions that we know how to differentiate,
that is, xn, sin(x), cos(x), tan(x) (or a constant times these functions,
or the sum of these functions). One simple way to guess the required
substitution is to look for a bracket.
Example 6.7
Differentiate y = (5x −2)3.
Solution
Substitute u = 5x −2 (the function in the bracket) so that
y = u3. Then
du
dx = 5
and
dy
du = 3u2.
Therefore,
dy
dx = dy
du
du
dx
gives
dy
dx = 5(3u2) = 15(5x −2)2
(resubstituting u = 5x −2).
Example 6.8
Differentiate y = cos(2x2 + 3).
Solution
Substitute u = 2x2 + 3, giving y = cos(u). Then
du
dx = 4x
and
dy
du = −sin(u).
Therefore,
dy
dx = dy
du
du
dx = −4x sin(u) = −4x sin(2x2 + 3).
Because of the widespread use of the chain rule it is useful to be able
to differentiate a composite function ‘in your head’. This is a technique
that comes with practice (like mental arithmetic).
Example 6.9
Differentiate V = 1/(t + 1).
Solution
Rewrite V = 1/(t + 1) as V = (t + 1)−1 and think of this as
V = ( )−1 where ( ) = t + 1.
Now differentiate V with respect to ( ) and multiply by the derivative
of ( ) with respect to t. That is,
dV
dt = dV
d( )
d( )

where ( ) can be any expression. So
dV

Rewrite
y =

(3t2 + 2t)2
as y = (3t2 + 2t)−2, and think of this as y = ( )−2 where ( ) = 3t2 + 2t.
Now differentiate y with respect to ( ) and multiply by the derivative
of ( ) with respect to t. That is,
dy
dt = dy
d( )
d( )
dt
where ( ) can be any expression. So
dy
dt = (−2(3t2 + 2t)−3) d

⇔
dy

⇔
dy

12t + 4
(3t2 + 2t)3 .
Derivative of inverse trigonometric
functions
By the deﬁnition of the inverse function we know that y = sin−1(x) ⇔
sin(y) = x, where −1 ≤x ≤1, and therefore the derivatives are related.
We can ﬁnd the derivative of sin−1(x) as in Example 6.11.
Example 6.11
Given
y = sin−1(x)
and
d
dx (sin(x)) = cos(x)
ﬁnd dy/dx.
Solution
As y
= sin−1(x) then by the deﬁnition of the inverse
(assuming x is limited to [−1, 1])
sin(y) = x
The left-hand side of this is a function of y, which we can call w; hence,
w = sin(y) and w = x. By the chain rule:
dw
dx = dw
dy
dy
dx
Differentiating w = x with respect to x gives dw/dx = 1.
TLFeBOOK

126
Differentiation
Differentiating w = sin(y) with respect to y gives
dw
dy = cos(y)
Hence,
dw
dx = dw
dy
dy
dx
becomes
1 = cos(y)dy
dx
Dividing both sides by cos(y) (if cos(y) ̸= 0) gives
dy
dx =
1
cos(y)
This is an expression for the derivative we want to ﬁnd but it is a
function of y instead of x. Use sin(y) = x and the trigonomet-
ric identity cos2(y) = 1 −sin2(y), giving cos(y) =

1 −sin2(y)
for (−π/2 ≤y ≤π/2). As sin(y) = x and cos(y) =
√
1 −x2,
we get
dy
dx =
1
√
1 −x2 .
The same method can be used to ﬁnd the derivatives of cos−1(x) and
tan−1(x) and we can now add these functions to the list, giving a new
table of standard derivatives, as in Table 6.3.

important in engineering are related by the derivative. Here is a list of
just some of these.

Example 6.16
A ball is thrown in the air so that the height of the ball
is found to be s = 3t −5t2. Find
(a)
the ball’s initial velocity when ﬁrst thrown into the air;
(b)
the time when it returns to the ground;
(c)
its ﬁnal velocity as it hits the ground.
Solution
(a)
v = ds
dt ,
s = 3t −5t2 ⇒ds
dt = 3 −10t
The ball is initially thrown into the air when t = 0, so
ds
dt = 3 −10(0) = 3 m s−1
TLFeBOOK

Differentiation
129
(b)
The ball returns to the ground on the second occasion so that the
distance travelled, s, is equal to 0. This time is given by solving the
equation for t when s = 0.
0 = 3t −5t2
⇔t(3 −5t) = 0
⇔t = 0 or 3 −5t = 0
⇔t = 0 or t = 3/5
Therefore, it must return to the ground when t = 3/5 = 0.6 s.
(c)
When t = 0.6, using v = ds/dt = 3 −10t
v = 3 −10(0.6) = 3 −6 = −3 m s−1
Therefore, the velocity as it hits the ground is, −3 m s−1.
Example 6.17
A rocket is moving with a velocity of v = 4t2 +
10 000 m s−1 over a brief period of time while leaving the Earth’s
atmosphere. Find its acceleration after 2 s.
Solution
Use a = dv/dt as v = 4t2 + 10 000. Then, a = 8t, and at
t = 2 this gives a = 16, so the acceleration after 2 s is 16 m s−2.
Example 6.18
The potential due to a point charge Q at a position r
from the charge is given by
V =

4πε0r
where ε0, the permittivity of free space, ≈8.85 × 10−12 F m−1 and
π ≈3.14.
Given that Q = 1 C, ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld strength at a distance of 5 m
using E = −dV /dr.
Solution
V =

substituting for ε0 and π and using Q = 1, we get
V =

When r = 5 m,
E = 9 × 109

6.7 Summary

The average rate of change of a function over a certain interval is
the same as the gradient of the chord drawn on the graph of the
function. This chord gradient, for a function, y = f (x), is given by
δy
δx = change in y
change in x
(2)
If the chord is very short then the gradient of the chord is approxi-
mately the gradient of the tangent to the graph at a particular spot,
that is, the slope of the graph at that point. The slope of the graph
gives the instantaneous rate of change of the function with respect to
its independent variable, known as its derivative. This is represented
by dy/dx. Then we have the deﬁnition
dy
dx = lim
δx→0
δy
δx = lim
δx→0
f (x + δx) −f (x)

This is read as ‘dy by dx is the limit, as delta x tends to 0, of delta
y over delta x’. The derivative of y = f (x), dy/dx, (‘dy by dx’),
can also be represented by f ′(x) (read as ‘f dashed of x’).

Derivatives of simple functions are given in Table 6.3. Rules are
used to differentiate combinations of these functions. These are:

Integration
7.1 Introduction
In Chapter 6, we saw that many physical quantities are related by one
being the rate of change, the derivative, of the other. It follows that there
must be a way of expressing the ‘inverse’ relationship. This is called
integration. Velocity is the rate of change of distance with time, distance
is the integral of velocity with respect to time.
Unfortunately, there are two issues that complicate the simple idea
that ‘integration is the inverse of differentiation’. First, we ﬁnd that there
are many different functions which are the integral of the same function.
Luckily, these functions only differ from each other by a constant. To
ﬁnd all the possible integrals of a function we can ﬁnd any one of them
and add on some constant, called the constant of integration. This type of
integral is called the indeﬁnite integral. As it is not satisfactory to have an
unknown constant left in the solution to a problem we employ some other
information to ﬁnd its value. Once the unknown constant is replaced by
some value to ﬁt a certain problem, we have the particular integral.
The second problem with integration is that most functions cannot be
integrated exactly, even apparently simple functions like sin(x)/x.
For this reason, numerical methods of integration are particularly
important. Thesemethodsalldependonunderstandingtheideaofintegra-
tion as area under the graph. The deﬁnite integral of a function, y = f (x),
is the integral between two values of x and therefore gives a number (not
a function of x) as a result. There is no uncertainty, hence it is called the
deﬁnite integral.
This chapter is concerned with methods of ﬁnding the integral, the for-
mulas that can be used for ﬁnding exact integrals and also with numerical
integration. We also look more closely at the deﬁnitions of deﬁnite and
indeﬁnite integrals and at applications of integration.
7.2 Integration
Integration is the inverse process to differentiation. Consider the follow-
ing examples (where C is a constant):
Function
→derivative
Integral
←function
x2 + C
2x
sin(x) + C
cos(x)
The derivative of x2 + C with respect to x is 2x, therefore, the integral
of 2x with respect to x is x2 + C. This can be written as
d
dx (x2 + C) = 2x
⇔

2x dx = x2 + C
TLFeBOOK

Integration
133

2x dx is read ‘the integral of 2x with respect to x’. The

notation is
like an ‘s’ representing a sum, and its origin will be explained more when
we look at the deﬁnite integral.
The second example gives
d
dx (sin(x) + C) = cos(x) ⇔

cos(x) dx = sin(x) + C
The derivative of sin(x) + C with respect to x is cos(x), which is the
same as saying that the integral of cos(x) with respect to x is sin(x) + C.
Constant of integration
Because the derivative of a constant is zero, it is not possible to
determine the exact integral simply through using inverse differentia-
tion. For instance, the derivatives of x2 + 1, x2 −2, and x2 + 1000, all
give 2x. Therefore, we express the integral of 2x as x2 + C, where C is
some constant called the constant of integration.
To ﬁnd the value that the constant of integration should take in the
solution of a particular problem we use some other known information.
Supposing we know that a ball has velocity v = 20 −10t. We want to
ﬁnd the distance travelled in time t and we also know that the ball was
thrown from the ground which is at distance 0. We can work out the
distance travelled by doing ‘inverse differentiation’ giving the distance
s = 20t −5t2 + C, where C is the constant of integration. As we also
know that s = 0 when t = 0 we can substitute these values to give 0 = C,
hence, the solution is that s = 20t −5t2.
In solving this problem we used the fact that v = ds/dt and therefore
we know that ds/dt = 20 −10t. This is called a differential equation
because it is an equation and contains an expression including a derivative.
This is one sort of differential equation which can be solved directly
by integrating. Some other sorts of differential equations are solved in
Chapters 8, 10, and 14.
In this case, the solution s = 20t −5t2 + C represents all possible
solutions of the differential equation and is therefore called the general
solution. If a value of C is found to solve a given problem, then this is
the particular solution.
Example 7.1
Find y such that dy/dx = 3x2 given that y is 5 when
x = 0.
Solution
We know that x3, on differentiation, gives 3x2, so
dy
dx = 3x2
⇔y =

3x2 dx
⇔y = x3 + C
where C is some constant. This is the general solution to the differential
equation. To ﬁnd the particular solution for this example use the fact that
y is 5 when x is 0. Substitute in y = x3 + C to give 5 = 0 + C, so C = 5
giving the particular solution as y = x3 + 5.
7.3 Finding
integrals
To ﬁnd the table of standard integrals we take Table 6.3 for differentiation,
swap the columns, rewrite a couple of the entries in a more convenient
form and add on the constant of integration. This gives Table 7.1.
As integration is ‘anti-differentiation’ we can spot the integral in the
standard cases, that is, those listed in Table 7.1.

We can also ﬁnd integrals of some combinations of the functions listed
in Table 7.1. To do this, we need to use rules similar to those for differen-
tiation. However, because when integrating we are working ‘backwards’,
the rules are not so simple as those used to perform differentiation and
furthermore, they will not always give a method that will work in ﬁnding
the desired integral.

Changing the variable of integration
In Chapter 6 we looked at differentiating composite functions. If y =
f (x) where we can make a substitution in order to express y in terms of
u, that is, y = g(u), where u = h(x), then
dy
dx = dy
du

dx .
TLFeBOOK

136
Integration
We can use this to integrate in very special cases by making a substi-
tution for a new variable. The idea is to rewrite the integral so that we
end up with one of the functions in Table 7.1. To see when this might
work as a method of integration, we begin by looking at differentiating
a composite function. Consider the derivative of
y = (3x + 2)3.
We differentiate this using the chain rule, giving
dy
dx = 3(3x + 2)2 d
dx (3x + 2) = 3(3x + 2)23.
As integration is backwards differentiation, therefore

3(3x + 2)23 dx = (3x + 3)3 + C.
Supposing then we had started with the problem to ﬁnd the following
integral

3(3x + 2)23 dx.
If we could spot that the expression to be integrated comes about from
differentiating using the chain rule then we would be able to perform the
integration. We can substitute u = 3x + 2 to give du/dx = 3, and the
integral becomes:

3u2 du
dx du
we then use the ‘trick’ of replacing (du/dx) dx by du giving

3u2 du.
As the expression to be integrated only involves the variable u, we can
perform the integration and we get

3u2 du = u3 + C.
Substituting again for u = 3x + 2, we get the integral as

3(3x + 2)23 dx = (3x + 2)3 + C.
TLFeBOOK

Integration
137
We used the trick of replacing (du/dx) dx by du, this can be justiﬁed
in the following argument. By the deﬁnition of the integral as inverse
differentiation, if y is differentiated with respect to x and then integrated
with respect to x we will get back to y, give or take a constant. This is
expressed by
 dy
dx dx = y + C.
(7.1)
If y is a composite function that can be written in terms of the variable u,
then
dy
dx = dy
du
du
dx .
Substituting the chain rule for dy/dx into Equation (7.1) gives
 dy
du
du
dx dx = y + C.
(7.2)
If y is a function of u, then we could just differentiate with respect to
u and then integrate again and we will get back to the same expression,
give or take a constant, that is
 dy
du du = y + C.
(7.3)
Considering Equations (7.2) and (7.3) together, we have
 dy
du
du
dx dx =
 dy
du du
so that we can represent this result symbolically by (du/dx) dx = du.
In practice, we make a substitution for u and change the variable of
integration by ﬁnding du/dx and substituting dx = du/(du/dx).
Example 7.4
Find the integral

−(4 −2x)3 dx.
Make the substitution u = 4−2x. Then du/dx = −2, so du = −2 dx
and dx = −du/2. The integral becomes

As this is the original expression that we integrated, this has shown that
our result was correct.

Integration
When using this method, to ﬁnd a good thing to substitute, look for
something in a bracket, or an ‘implied’ bracket. Such substitutions will
not always lead to an expression which it is possible to integrate. However,
if the integral is of the form

f (u) dx, where u is a linear function of x,
or if the integral is of the form

f (u)du
dx dx
then a substitution will work providing f (u) is a function with a known
integral (i.e. a function listed in Table 7.1).

Make the substitution for u(x). This type of integration will often work
when the expression to be integrated is of the form of a product. One of
the terms will be a composite function. This term could well involve an
expression in brackets, in which case substitute the expression in the
bracket for a new variable u. The integral should simplify, provided
the other part of the product is of the form du/dx.

that is, there is a function of a function multiplied by the derivative of the

Sometimes you may want to try to perform this method of integration
and discover that it fails to work, in this case, another method must be
used.

This substitution has not worked. We are no nearer being able to perform
the integration. There is still a term in x involved in the integral, so we
are not able to perform an integration with respect to u only.
In some of these cases, integration by parts may be used.
Integration by parts
This can be useful for integrating some products,
for example,

x sin(x) dx. The formula is derived from the formula for differentiation
of a product.

As we found before (du/dx) dx can be replaced by du so (dv/dx) dx
can be replaced by dv, and this gives a compact way of remembering the
formula:

u dv = uv −

v du.
To use the formula, we need to make a wise choice as to which term is
u (which we then need to differentiate to ﬁnd du) and which term is dv
(which we then need to integrate to ﬁnd v). Note that the second term

v du must be easy to integrate.

There are many possible ways of using trigonometric identities in order
to perform integration. We shall just look at examples of how to deal with
powers of trigonometric functions. For even powers of a trigonometric
function, the double angle formula may be used. For odd powers of a
trigonometric function a method involving the substitution
cos2(x) = 1 −sin2(x) or sin2(x) = 1 −cos2(x)
is used.

Applications of
integration
In Section 6.7, we listed the applications of differentiation that are impor-
tant in engineering. Here, we list the equivalent relationships using
integration.


v dt, where v = velocity, x = distance, t = time
v =

a dt, where a = acceleration, v = velocity, t = time
W =

F dx, where F = force, W = work done (or energy used),
x = distance moved in the direction of the force

F dt, where F = force, p = momentum, t = time
W =

Gases

W dV , where p = pressure, W = work done under isothermal
expansion, V = volume.
Electrical circuits


I dt, where I = current, Q = charge, t = time
I = (1/L)

Example 7.15
A car moving with a velocity of 12 m s−1 acceler-
ated uniformly for 10 s at 1 m s−2 and then kept a constant velocity.
Calculate:
(a)
the distance travelled during the acceleration,
(b)
the velocity reached after 20 m,
(c)
the time taken to travel 100 m from the time that the acceleration
ﬁrst started.
Solution
Take as time 0 the time when the car begins to accelerate.
From t = 0 to t = 10, the acceleration is 1 m s−2 dv/dt = 1. Therefore,
v =

1 dt = t + C. For 0 ≤t ≤10, this gives v = t + C. To ﬁnd
the constant C, we need to use other information given in the problem.
We know that at t = 0 the velocity is 12 m s−1. Substituting this into
v = t + C gives
12 = 0 + C
⇔
C = 12
so, v = t + 12. For t > 10, the velocity is constant, therefore v =
10 + 12 = 22 m s−1 for t > 10. The velocity function is therefore
v =

t + 12
0 ≤t ≤10
22
t > 10.
TLFeBOOK

146
Integration
To ﬁnd the distance travelled we need to integrate one more time
v = dx
dt = t + 12
for 0 ≤t ≤10
x = t2 + 12t + C
for 0 ≤t ≤10.
To ﬁnd the value of C, consider that the distance travelled is 0 at t = 0.
Hence, 0 = C and therefore
x = t2 + 12t
for 0 ≤t ≤10.
For t > 10, we have a different expression for the velocity
v = dx
dt = 22
for t > 10
x = 22t + C
for t > 10.
To ﬁnd the value of C is this expression, we need some information
about the distance travelled, for instance, at t = 10. Using x = t2 + 12t,
we get that at t = 10, x = 100 + 120 = 220 m. Substituting this into
x = 22t + C gives 220 = 22 × 10 + C, which gives C = 0, so x = 22t
for t ≥10. The function for x is therefore
x =

t2 + 12t
0 ≤t ≤10
22t
t > 10.
As we now have expressions for v and x, we are in a position to answer
the questions.
(a)
The distance travelled during the acceleration is the distance
after 10 s.
x = (10)2 + 12(10) = 220 m.
(b)
To ﬁnd the velocity reached after 20 m, we need ﬁrst to ﬁnd the time
taken to travel 20 m
x = 20 ⇒20 = t2 + 12t
t2 + 12t −20 = 0.
Using the formula for solving a quadratic equation:
at2 + bt + c = 0

t ≈−13.5 or t ≈1.5 s.
As t cannot be negative, t ≈1.5 s. Substituting the value for t
into the expression for v gives
v = t + 12 = 1.5 + 12 = 13.5 m s−1.
So the velocity after 20 m is 13.5 ms−1.

(c)
The time taken to travel 100 m from when the acceleration ﬁrst
started can be found from x = 100
100 = t2 + 12t

t2 + 12t −100 = 0.
Using the quadratic formula gives
t = −12 ±

t ≈−17.66 or t ≈5.66.
The time taken to travel 100 m is 5.66 s.
Example 7.16
The current across a 1 µF capacitor from time t = 3 ms
to t = 4 ms is given by I(t) = −2t. Find the voltage across the capacitor
during that period of time given that V = −0.1 V when t = 3 ms.
Solution
For a capacitor V = Q/C, where Q =

I dt and C is the
capacitance, V the voltage drop across the capacitor, Q the charge, and
I the current. So
V =
1
1 × 10−6

−2t dt
= 106(−t2) + C
when t = 3 ms, V = 0.1, so V = 0.1 when t = 3 × 10−3
0.1 = 106(−10−6 × 9) + C
⇔
C = 0.1 + 9
⇔
C = 9.1.
So V = −106t2 + 9.1.
7.5 The deﬁnite
integral
The deﬁnite integral from x = a to x = b is deﬁned as the area under
the curve between those two points. In the graph in Figure 7.1, the area
under the graph has been approximated by dividing it into rectangles. The
height of each is the value of y and if each rectangle is the same width
then the area of the rectangle is yδx.
If the rectangle is very thin, then y will not vary very much over its
width and the area can reasonably be approximated as the sum of all of
these rectangles.
The symbol for a sum is  (read as capital Greek letter sigma). The
area under the graph is approximately
A = y1δx + y2δx + y3δx + y4δx + · · · =
x=b−δx
	
x=a
yδx.
We would assume that if δx is made smaller, the approximation to the
exact area would improve. An example is given for the function y = x in
Figure 7.2. Between the values of 1 and 2, we divide the area into strips,
ﬁrst of width 0.1, then 0.01, then 0.001.

Integration
Figure 7.1
A graph of
y = f (x) and the area under
the graph from x = a to
x = b. This is approximated
by splitting the area into strips
of width δx.
When δx = 0.1, the approximate calculation gives
1 × 0.1 + 1.1 × 0.1 + 1.2 × 0.1 + 1.3 × 0.1 + 1.4 × 0.1 + 1.5 × 0.1
+ 1.6 × 0.1 + 1.7 × 0.1 + 1.8 × 0.1 + 1.9 × 0.1 = 1.45
When δx = 0.01, the calculation gives
1 × 0.01 + 1.01 × 0.01 + 1.02 × 0.01 + · · ·
+ 1.98 × 0.01 + 1.99 × 0.01 = 1.495
When δx = 0.001, the calculation gives
1 × 0.001 + 1.001 × 0.001 + 1.002 × 0.001 + · · ·
+ 1.998 × 0.001 + 1.999 × 0.001 = 1.4995
The exact answer is given by the area of a trapezoid which is equal to
the average length of the parallel sides multiplied by the width. In this
case for ya = 1 and yb = 2 we get
Area = 1
2(1 + 2)1 = 1.5
We can see that the smaller the strips the nearer the area approximates
to the exact area of 1.5. Therefore, as the width of the strips gets smaller
and smaller, then there is a better approximation to the area, and we say
that in the limit, as the width tends to zero, we have the exact area, which
is called the deﬁnite integral.
The area under the curve, y = f (x) between x = a and x = b is
found as
 b
a
y dx = lim
δx→0
x=b−δx
	
x=a
y δx
which is read as ‘The deﬁnite integral of y from x = a to x = b equals
the limit as δx tends to 0 of the sum of y times δx for all x from x = a
to x = b −δx.
This is the deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral which gives a number as
its result, not a function.
We need to show that our two ways of deﬁning integration (the indeﬁ-
nite integral as the inverse process to differentiation and the deﬁnite
integral as the area under the curve) are consistent. To do this, consider

Integration
Notice that as we move the ﬁnal point x, A will change. Now consider
moving the ﬁnal value by a small amount, δx, this will increase the area
by δA and δA is approximately the area of a rectangle of height y and
width δx. This is shown in Figure 7.3.
Figure 7.3
The area A is
given by the deﬁnite integral
 x
a y dx and the increase in
the area, δA = yδx.
So, we have δA ≈yδx, that is,
δA
δx ≈y.
Taking the limit as δx tends to 0 gives
y = dA
dx .
Thisshowsthatﬁndingtheareaunderthegraphdoesinfactgiveafunction
which, when differentiated, gives back the function of the original graph,
that is, the area function gives the ‘inverse’ of differentiation. The area
function, A, is not unique because different functions will be found by
moving the position of the starting point for the area, however in each
case dA/dx will be the original function.
This is illustrated for the area under y = 1
2t in Figure 7.4, where there
are two area functions, one starting from t = −1 and the other from t = 0.
The ﬁrst area function is
A = t2
4 −1
4
and the second is
A = t2

The deﬁnite integral, the area under a particular section of the graph,
can be found, as in Figure 7.5, by subtracting the areas.
In practice, we do not need to worry about the starting value for ﬁnding
the area. The effect of any constant of integration will cancel out.

Find
 3
2 2t dt.
This is the area under the graph from t = 2 to t = 3. As

2t dt =
t2 + C, the area up to 2 is (2)2 + C = 4 + C and the area up to 3 is
(3)2 + C = 9 + C. The difference in the areas is 9 + C −(4 + C) =
9 −4 = 5. Therefore,

2 2t dt = 5.

this case 2, subtracted.

Finding the area when the
integral is negative
The integral can be negative if the curve is below the x-axis as in

The integral is negative because the values of y are negative in that
region. In the case where all of that portion of the curve is below the
x-axis to ﬁnd the area we just take the modulus. Therefore, the shaded
area A = 1.
This is important because negative and positive areas can cancel out
giving an integral of 0. In Figure 7.8, the area under the curve y = sin(x)
from x = 0 to x = 2π is pictured. The area under the curve has a positive
part from 0 to π and an equal negative part from π to 2π.

So, the total area is 2 + | −2| = 4.
We have seen that if we wish to ﬁnd the area bounded by a curve which
crosses the x-axis, then we must ﬁnd where it crosses the x-axis ﬁrst and
perform the integration in stages.

Find the area bounded by the curve y = x2 −x and the

The root mean squared (r.m.s) value
The ‘root mean squared value’ (r.m.s. value) means the square root of
the mean value of the square of y. The formula for the r.m.s. value of y
between x = a and x = b is
r.m.s.(y) =

1
b −a
 b

y2 dx
The advantage of the r.m.s.value is that as all the values for y are
squared, they are positive, so the r.m.s.value will not give 0 unless we are
considering the zero function. If the function represents the voltage then
the r.m.s. value can be used to calculate the average power in the signal.
In contrast the mean value gives zero if calculated for the sine or cosine
over a complete cycle, giving no additional useful information.

Methods of
Integration
Many problems may be difﬁcult to solve analytically. In such cases
numerical methods may be used. This is often necessary in order to per-
form integrations. The following integrals could not be solved by the
methods of integration we have met so far:
 3

x2 + 1 dx
 2

2x2 dx
Numerical methods can usually only give an approximate answer.
General method
We wish to approximate the integral
 b
a
f (x) dx
Formulae for numerical integration are obtained by considering the
area under the graph and splitting the area into strips, as in Figure 7.11.
The area of the strips can be approximated using the trapezoidal rule or
Simpson’s rule. In each case, we assume that the thickness of each strip
is h and that there are N strips, so that
h = (b −a)
N
Numerical methods are obviously to be used with a computer or pos-
sibly a programmable calculator. However, it is a good idea to be able to
check some simple numerical results, which needs some understanding
of the algorithms used.
The trapezoidal rule
The strips are approximated to trapeziums with parallel sides of length
yr−1 and yr as in Figure 7.12. The area of each strip is (h/2)(yr−1 + yr).
Figure 7.11
Numerical
integration is performed by
splitting the area into strips of
width h. The area of the strips
is approximated using the
trapezoidal rule or Simpson’s
rule.
TLFeBOOK

Integration
157
Figure 7.12
The trapezoidal
rule is found by approximating
each of the strips as a
trapezium.
The formula becomes:
A = h
 1
2y0 + y1 + y2 + · · · + yN−1 + 1
2yN

where xr = a + rh.
yr = f (xr)
N = (b −a)
h
.
A computer program would more likely use the equivalent recurrence
relation, where Ar is the area up to rth strip (at x = xr)
Ar = Ar−1 + h
2 (yr−1 + yr)
for r = 1 to N and A0 = 0.
This is simply stating that the area is found by adding on the area of
one strip at a time to the previously found area.
Example 7.24
We wish to approximate
 3
1
x2 dx.
The limits of the integration are 1 and 3, so a = 1 and b = 3. We choose
a step size of 0.5, therefore,
N = (b −a)
h
= (3 −1)
0.5
= 4.
TLFeBOOK

158
Integration
Using xr = a + rh and yr = f (xr), which in this case gives yr = x2
r
we get
x0 = 1
y0 = (1)2 = 1
x1 = 1.5
y1 = (1.5)2 = 2.25
x2 = 2
y2 = (2)2 = 4
x3 = 2.5
y3 = (2.5)2 = 6.25
x4 = 3
y4 = (3)2 = 9.
Using the formula for the trapezoidal rule:
A = h( 1
2y0 + y1 + y2 + · · · + yN−1 + 1
2yN)
we get
A = 0.5(0.5 + 2.25 + 4 + 6.25 + 4.5) = 8.75.
Hence, by the trapezoidal rule:
 3
1
x2 dx ≈8.75.
Simpson’s rule
For Simpson’s rule, the area of each strip is approximated by drawing a
parabola through three adjacent points (see Figure 7.13). Notice that the
number of strips must be even.
The area of the strips in this case is not obvious as in the case of the
trapezoidal rule. Three strips together have an area of:

From the limits of the integral we ﬁnd that a = 1 and b = 3.
So,

h

= 4.
Using xr = a + rh and yr = f (xr), which in this case gives
yr = x2

we get
x0 = 1
y0 = (1)2 = 1
x1 = 1.5
y1 = (1.5)2 = 2.25
x2 = 2
y2 = (2)2 = 4
x3 = 2.5
y3 = (2.5)2 = 6.25
x4 = 3
y4 = (3)2 = 9.
Hence,
A = 0.5
3 (1 + 4(2.25) + 2(4) + 4(6.25) + 9) ≈8.66667.
In this case, as we are integrating a parabola the result is exact (except
for rounding errors).

1.
Integration can be deﬁned as the inverse process of differentiation.
If y = f (x) then
dy
dx = f ′(x)
⇔
y =

or equivalently
 dy
dx dx = y + C.
This is called indeﬁnite integration and C is the constant of
integration.

A table of standard integrals can be found as in Table 7.1 by swapping
the columns of Table 6.3, rearranging them in a more convenient form
and adding the constant of integration.

The exponential
function
8.1 Introduction
In Example 2.11, we looked at an acoustical absorption problem. We
found that after a single note on a trombone had been played, the sound
intensity decayed according to the expression I = 10−11t. This is a dying
exponential function. Many other physical situations involve decay or
growth in an exponential fashion; for instance, population growth or the
decay of charge on a discharging capacitor. The functions y = at, where
a can be any positive number, are called exponential functions. In this
chapter, we shall look at how they describe this particular type of growth
or decay, when the growth or decay is proportional to the current size
of the ‘population’, y. This situation can be described by a differential
equation of the form dy/dt = ky. The special case where k = 1, giving
the equation dy/dt = y, leads us to deﬁne the number e ≈2.7182818
and the function y = et, which is called the exponential function. The
inverse function is y = loge(t), which is also refered to as y = ln(t) and
called the natural or Napierian logarithm.
The function y = et is neither even nor odd; however, it is possible
to split any real function into an even part and an odd part and in this
case we ﬁnd that this gives the hyperbolic functions. These hyperbolic
functions have properties that are surprisingly similar to the properties of
thetrigonometricfunctionsandhencehavesimilarnames, cosh(t), sinh(t)
(the hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine) from which we can deﬁne
also tanh(t), the hyperbolic tangent. We also look at differentiation and
integration problems involving the exponential and hyperbolic functions.
8.2 Exponential
growth and
decay
Supposing, following some deed of heroism, the police offered you the
choice of the following rewards:
(a)
Tomorrow you receive 1 c and the following day 2 c and after that
4 c, then 8 c and each day the amount doubles for the next month.
(b)
Tomorrow you receive e2, the following day e4 and the day after
e6, then e8 so that each day you receive e2 more than the day
before. Againyoureceivepaymentsoneverydayforthenextmonth.
If, although not motivated by personal greed, you wish to receive the
highest possible reward (in order, presumably, to donate the amount
to charity), which reward should you accept? Option (b) superﬁcially
appears to be the best because at least it starts off with enough money
to buy a small sandwich. However, a closer look reveals the that if you
chooseoption(a), onthelastday(assumingthereare31daysinthemonth)
you receive in excess of e10 000 000 with the total reward exceeding e20
million. However, option (b) only reaps e62 on the ﬁnal day with a total
award of only e992.
TLFeBOOK

The exponential function
163
Both options are examples of growth. Option (b) gives a constant
growth rate of e2. If yn is the amount received on day n, the way that this
grows could be expressed by yn+1 = yn + 2. This is expressing the fact
that the amount received on day n+1 is e2 more than the amount received
on day n. This also means that the change each day in the amount received
is 2, which can be expressed as 
yn = 2, where 
yn = yn+1 −yn and
represents the change in y from day n to day n + 1.
Option (a) is an example of exponential growth (or geometric growth).
The amount received each day is proportional to the amount received the
daybefore, inthiscasetwiceasmuch. yn canbeexpressedbyyn+1 = 2yn.
The change in y is equal to the value of y itself, 
yn = yn.
Because of the nature of exponential growth it is unlikely that you
would be given such an attractive award as option (a) represents. However,
exponential growth is not beyond the reach of the everyday person as
savings accounts offer this opportunity. Unfortunately, the amount you
receive does not increase as quickly as doubling each day but it is based
on how much you have already in the bank; hence, it is exponential.
Supposing you opened an account that paid an annual interest of 6%
and the annual rate of inﬂation was 3%, then the real rate of growth is
approximately 3% per annum. If yn is the value of the amount you have
in the bank after n years then yn+1 = 1.03yn. We can also express this by
saying that the interest received each year, that is, the change in yn, 
yn,
is 3% of yn, that is, 
yn = 0.03yn, where 
yn = yn+1 −yn. If the rate
of interest remains constant then if you deposit e1 tomorrow then your
descendents, in only 500 years time, will receive an amount worth over
e2.5 million in real terms.
The models of growth that we have discussed so far give examples of
recurrence relations, also called difference equations. Their solutions are
not difﬁcult to ﬁnd. For instance, if yn+1 = 2yn and we know that on day 1
we received 1 c, that is, y1 = 0.01 then we can substitute n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
(as we did in Section 1.4) to ﬁnd values of the function giving
0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, . . .
Clearly, there is a power of 2 involved in the expression for yn, so we
can guess that y = 0.01 (2n−1). By checking a few values of n we
can conﬁrm that this is indeed the amount received each day. When we
deposit e1 in the bank at a real rate of growth of 3% we get the recur-
rence relation yn+1 = 1.03yn, where yn is the current day value of the
amount in the savings account after n years. Substituting a few values
beginning with y0 = 1 (the amount we initially deposit) we then get
1, 1.03, 1.06, 1.09, 1.13, 1.16, 1.19, . . . (to the nearest cent). Each time we
multiply the amount by 1.03, there must be a power of 1.03 in the solution
for y. We can guess the solution as yn = (1.03)n. By checking a few val-
ues of n we can conﬁrm that this is, in fact, the amount in the bank after
n years.
The models we have looked at so far are discrete models. In the case
of the money in the bank the increase occurs at the end of each year.
However, if we consider population growth, for instance, then it is not
possible to say that the population grows at the end of a certain period, the
growth could happen at any moment of time. In this case, providing the
population is large enough, it is easier to model the situation continuously,
using a differential equation. Such models take the form of dy/dt = ky.
dy/dt is the rate of growth, if k is positive, or the rate of decay, if k
is negative. The equation states that the rate of growth or decay of a
population of size y is proportional to the size of the population.

The exponential function
Example 8.1
A malfunctioning fridge maintains a temperature of 6◦C
which allows a population of bacteria to reproduce such that, on average,
each bacteria divides every 20 min. Assuming no bacteria die in the time
under consideration ﬁnd a differential equation to describe the population
growth.
Solution
If the population at time t is given by p then the rate of change
of the population is dp/dt. The increase in the population is such that it
approximately doubles every 20 min, that is, it increases by p in 20×60 s.
That gives a rate of increase as p/(20 × 60) per second. Hence, the
differential equation describing the population is
dp
dt =
p
1200.

circuit.
Example 8.2
A capacitor, in an RC circuit, has been charged to
a charge of Q0. The voltage source has been removed and the
circuit closed as in Figure 8.1. Find a differential equation that
describes the rate of discharge of the capacitor if C = 0.001 µF and
R = 10 M.
Solution
The voltage across a capacitor is given by Q/C where C is the
capacitance and Q is the charge on the capacitor. The voltage across
the resistor is given by Ohm’s Law as IR. From Kirchoff’s voltage law,
the sum of the voltage drops in the circuit must be 0; therefore, as the
circuit is closed, we get voltage across the resistor + voltage across the
capacitor = 0:
⇒IR + Q
C = 0.
By deﬁnition, the current is the rate of change of charge with respect to
time, that is I = dQ/dt giving the differential equation
R dQ
dt + Q
C = 0.
We can rearrange this equation as
R dQ
dt = −Q
C
⇔
dQ
dt = −Q
RC .
We can see that this is an equation for exponential decay. The rate of
change of the charge on the capacitor is proportional to the remain-
ing charge at any point in time with a constant of proportionality
given by 1/RC. In this case as R = 10 M and C = 0.001 µF,
we get
dQ
dt = −100Q.
Example 8.3
Radioactivity is the emission of α- or β-particles and
γ -rays due to the disintegration of the nuclei of atoms. The rate of dis-
integration is proportional to the number of atoms at any point in time
and the constant of proportionality is called the radioactivity decay con-
stant. The radioactive decay constant for Radium B is approximately
4.3 × 10−4 s−1. Give a differential equation that describes the decay of
the number of particles N in a piece of Radium B.
TLFeBOOK

The exponential function
165
Solution
If the number of particles at time t is N, then the rate of change
is dN/dt. The decay is proportional to the number of atoms, and we are
given that the constant of proportionality is 4.3 × 10−4 s−1 so that we
have
dN
dt = −4.3 × 10−4N
as the equation which describes the decay.
Example 8.4
An object is heated so that its temperature is 400 K and
the temperature of its surroundings is 300 K, and then it is left to cool.
Newton’s law of cooling states that the rate of heat loss is proportional
to the excess temperature over the surroundings. Furthermore, if m is the
mass of the object and c is its speciﬁc heat capacity then the rate of change
of heat is proportional to the rate of fall of temperature of the body, and
is given by
dQ
dt = −mcdφ
dt
where Q is the heat in the body and φ is its temperature. Find a differential
equation for the temperature that describes the way the body cools.
Solution
Newton’s law of cooling gives
dQ
dt = A(φ −φs)
where A is some constant of proportionality, Q is the heat in the body, φ
is its temperature, and φs is the temperature of its surroundings. As we
also know that
dQ
dt = −mcdφ
dt
this can be substituted in our ﬁrst equation giving:
−mcdφ
dt = A(φ −φs) ⇔
dφ
dt = −A
mc(φ −φs)
A/(mc) can be replaced by a constant k, giving
dφ
dt = −k(φ −φs).
In this case, the temperature of the surroundings is known to be 300 K,
so the equation describing the rate of change of temperature is
dφ
dt = −k(φ −300).
We have established that there are a number of important physical sit-
uations that can be described by the equation dy/dt = ky. The rate of
change of y is proportional to its value. We would like to solve this equa-
tion, that is, ﬁnd y explicitly as a function of t. In Chapter 7, we solved
TLFeBOOK

166
The exponential function
simple differential equations such as dy/dt = 3t by integrating both sides
with respect to t, for example,
dy
dt = 3t
⇔y =

3t dt
⇔y = 3t2
2 + C.
However, we cannot solve the equation dy/dt = ky in this way because
the right-hand side is a function of y not of t. If we integrate both sides
with respect to t we get
dy
dt = ky
⇔y =

ky dt.
Although this is true we are no nearer solving for y as we need to know
y as a function of t in order to ﬁnd

ky dt.
When we solved equations in Chapter 3 of the Background Mathe-
matics notes available on the companion website for this book, we said
that one method was to guess a solution and substitute that value for the
unknown into the equation to see if it gave a true statement. This would
be a very long method to use unless we are able to make an informed
guess. We can use this method with this differential equation as we know
from our experience with problems involving discrete growth that a solu-
tion should involve an exponential function of the form y = at. The
main problem is to ﬁnd the value of a, which will go with any particular
equation. To do this we begin by looking for an exponential function that
would solve the equation dy/dt = y, that is, we want to ﬁnd the function
whose derivative is equal to itself.
8.3 The
exponential
function y = et
Figures 8.2(a) and 8.3(a) give graphs of y = 2t and y = 3t, which are
two exponential functions. We can sketch their derivative functions by
drawing tangents to the graph and measuring the gradient of the tan-
gent at various different points. The derivative functions are pictured in
Figure 8.2(b), dy/dt where y = 2t, and in Figure 8.3(b), dy/dt where
y = 3t.
We can see that for these exponential functions the derivative has
the same shape as the original function but has been scaled in the
y-direction, that is, multiplied by a constant, k, so that dy/dt = ky as we
expected:
d
dt (2t) = (C)(2t)
and
d
dt (3t) = (D)(3t)
where C and D are constants. We can see from the graphs that C < 1 and
D > 1. Thus, the derivative of 2t gives a squashed version of the original
graph and the derivative of 3t gives a stretched version of the original
graph.
It would seem reasonable that there would be a number somewhere
between 2 and 3 that we can call e, which has the property that the
derivative of et is exactly the same as the original graph. That is,
d
dt (et) = et.

derivative (the gradient of the

Finding the value of e
There are various methods for ﬁnding the value of e and a graphical
investigation into ﬁnding e to one decimal place is given in the projects
and investigations available on the companion website for this book. An
alternative, numerical, method is to look at the gradient of the chord for
the function y = et at t = 0:
δy
δt = f (t + δt) −δt
δt
= et+δt −et
δt
At t = 0 all functions y = at have value 1 so that the gradient of the
chord at t = 0 is
δy
δt = eδt −1
δt
We deﬁned e as the number for which d
dt (et) = et so that at the point
t = 0 the gradient of the tangent is given by dy/dt = 1. For small δt
the gradient of the tangent is approximately equal to the gradient of the
chord

dt ≈δy

We have shown that e = 2.71828 to ﬁve decimal places. e is an irra-
tional number which means that it cannot be written exactly as a fraction
(or as a decimal). The function et is often referred to as exp(t). et and its
derivative are shown in Figure 8.4.
By deﬁnition of the logarithm (as given in Chapter 4 of the Background
Mathematics notes available on the companion website for this book), we
know that the inverse function to et is loge(t) (log, base e, of t). This is
often represented by the short hand of ln(t) and called the natural or
Napierian logarithm.
We are now able to solve the differential equation dy/dt = y as we
know that one solution is y = et because the derivative of y = et is et.
When we discussed differential equations in Chapter 7, we noticed that
there was an arbitrary constant that was involved in the solution of a
differential equation. In this case the constant represents the initial size
of the population, or the initial charge or the initial number of atoms or
the initial temperature. The general solution to dy/dt = y is y = y0et
where y0 is the value of y at time t = 0. We can show that this is, in fact,
the general solution by substituting into the differential equation.

is a solution to the equation

The exponential function
Solution
(a)
To show that y = y0et are solutions, we ﬁrst differentiate
d
dt (y0et) = y0et
(as y0 is a constant and d(et)/dt = et).
Substitute for dy/dt and for y into the differential equation and
we get y0et = y0et, which is a true statement for all t. Hence the
solutions to dy/dt = y are y = y0et.
(b)
Substitute t = 0 in the function y = y0et and we get y = y0e0. As
any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, we have y = y0. Hence
y0 is the value of y at t = 0.
Using the function of a function rule we can ﬁnd the derivative
of ekt, where k is some constant, and show that this function can be
used to solve differential equations of the form dy/dt = ky.
The derivative of ekt
To ﬁnd the derivative of y = ekt where k is a constant substitute u = kt
so that y = eu

therefore, using the chain rule,

du = k eu = k ekt
(resubstituting u = kt). Therefore,
d
dt (ekt) = k ekt
Noticethatifwesubstitutey forekt intod(ekt)/dt = k ekt wegetdy/dt =
ky, which was the differential equation we set out to solve for our growth
or decay problems.
This tells us that one solution to the equation dy/dt = ky is y = ekt.
The general solution must involve a constant, so we try y = y0ekt where
y0 is the initial size of the population, or initial temperature, etc.

is a solution to the equation

(b)
Show that in the function y = y0ekt, y = y0 when t = 0.

171
Solution
(a)
To show that y = y0ekt are solutions we ﬁrst differentiate:
d
dt (y0ekt) = y0kekt
as y0 is a constant and d(ekt)/dt = kekt. Substitute for dy/dt and
for y into the differential equation and we get
y0kekt = ky0ekt
which is a true statement for all values of t. Hence the solutions to
dy/dt = ky are y = y0ekt.
(b)
Substitute t = 0 in the function y = y0et and we get y = y0e0. As
any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, we have y = y0. Hence,
y0 is the value of y at t = 0.
Example 8.7
Solve the differential equation given in Example 8.2,
describing the discharge of a capacitor in a closed RC circuit with
R = 10 M and C = 0.001 µF:
dQ
dt = −100Q
and ﬁnd a particular solution given that at t = 0 the voltage drop against
the capacitor was 1000 V.
Solution
We have discovered that the solution to a differential equation
of the form dy/dt = kt is given by y = y0ekt where y0 is the initial value
of y.
Comparing dy/dt = ky with dQ/dt = −100Q, and replacing y by Q
and k by −100, we get the solution
Q = Q0e−100t
To ﬁnd the value of Q0 we need to ﬁnd the value of Q when t = 0. We are
told that the initial value of the voltage across the capacitor was 1000 V
and we know that the voltage drop across a capacitor is Q/C. Therefore,
we have
Q0
0.001 × 10−6 = 1000 ⇔Q0 = 1000 × 0.001 × 10−6
⇔Q0 = 10−6 C.
Therefore, the equation that describes the charge as the capacitor
discharges is Q = 10−6e−100t C at time t s.
The derivative of at
The derivative of y = 2t can now be found by observing that 2 = e(ln(2)).
Therefore, y = 2t = (eln(2))t = eln(2)t. This is of the form ekt with
TLFeBOOK

172
The exponential function
k = ln(2). As
d
dt (ekt) = kekt
then
d
dt (eln(2)t) = ln(2)et ln(2)
Using again the fact that eln(2)t = (eln(2))t = 2t we get
d
dt (2t) = d
dt (eln(2)t) = ln(2)eln(2)t = ln(2)2t
that is
d
dt (2t) = ln(2)2t
Compare this result to that which we found by sketching the derivative of
y = 2t in Figure 8.2(b). We said that the derivative graph was a squashed
version of the original graph. This result tells us that the scaling factor
is ln(2) ≈0.693, which conﬁrms our observation that the scaling factor,
C < 1.
Using the same argument for any exponential function y = at we ﬁnd
that dy/dt = ln(a)at.
In ﬁnding these results we have used the fact that an exponential
function, to whatever base, a, can be written as ekt where k = ln(a).
The derivative of y = ln(x)
y = ln(x) is the inverse function of f (x) = ex, and therefore we can ﬁnd
the derivative in a manner similar to that used to ﬁnd the derivatives of
the inverse trigonometric functions in Chapter 5.
y = ln(x) where x > 0
⇔
ey = eln(x) (take the exponential of both sides)
⇔
ey = x (as exp is the inverse function to ln, eln(x) = x)
We wish to differentiate both sides with respect to x but the left-hand side
is a function of y, so we use the chain rule, setting w = ey, thus, equation
ey = x becomes w = x and dw/dy = ey.
Differentiating both sides of w = x with respect to x gives dw/dx = 1,
where

(we can divide by x as x > 0). Hence,

8.4 The
hyperbolic
functions
Any function deﬁned for both positive and negative values of x can be
written as the sum of an even and odd function. That is, for any function
y = f (x) we can write
f (x) = fe(x) + fo(x)
where
fe(x) = f (x) + f (−x)
2
and
fo(x) = f (x) −f (−x)
2
.
The even and odd parts of the function ex are given the names of hyper-
bolic cosine and hyperbolic sine. The names of the functions are usually
shortened to cosh(x) (read as ‘cosh of x’) and sinh(x) (read as ‘shine
of x’).
ex = cosh(x) + sinh(x)
and
cosh(x) = ex + e−x
2
,
sinh(x) = ex −e−x
2
.
They are called the hyperbolic sine and cosine because they bear the same
sort of relationship to the hyperbola as the sine and cosine do to the circle.
When we introduced the trigonometric functions in Chapter 5 we used
a rotating rod of length r. The horizontal and vertical positions of the
tip of the rod as it travels around the circle deﬁnes the cosine and sine

The exponential function
function, respectively. A point (x, y) on the circle can be deﬁned using
x = r cos(α), y = r sin(α). These are called parametric equations for
the circle and α is the parameter. If the parameter is eliminated then we
get the equation of the circle
x2
r2 + y2
r2 = 1
(shown in Figure 8.4(a)). Any point on a hyperbola can similarly be
deﬁned in terms of a parameter, α, and thus we get x = a cosh(α) and
y = b sinh(α).
If the parameter is eliminated from the equations we get the equation
for the hyperbola as
x2
a2 −y2
b2 = 1
Figure 8.5(b) shows the graph of the hyperbola.
The function y = tanh(x) is deﬁned, similarly to the tan(x), as
tanh(x) = sinh(x)
cosh(x)
and the reciprocal of these three main functions may be deﬁned as
cosech(x) =
1
sinh(x)
(the hyperbolic cosecant)
sech(x) =
1
cosh(x)
(the hyperbolic secant)
coth(x) =

tanh(x)
(the hyperbolic cotangent)
The graphs of cosh(x), sinh(x), and tanh(x) are shown in Figure 8.6.

cosh(x) = (ex + e−x)/2
sinh(x) = (ex −e−x)/2
tanh(x) = sinh(x)/ cosh(x) = (ex −e−x)/(ex + e−x)
cosh(x) + sinh(x) = ex
cosh(x) −sinh(x) = e−x
cosh(A ± B) = cosh(A) cosh(B) ± sinh(A) sinh(B)
sinh(A ± B) = sinh(A) cosh(B) ± cosh(A) sinh(B)
tanh(A ± B) = (tanh(A) ± tanh(B))/(1 ± tanh(A) tanh(B))
Hyperbolic identities
The hyperbolic identities are similar to those for trigonometric functions.
A list of the more important ones is given in Table 8.2.

1
4(2eA+B + 2e−(A+B)) = 1
2(eA+B + e−(A+B))
which is the deﬁnition of cosh(A + B).
We have shown that the right-hand side of the expression is equal to
the left-hand side, and therefore
cosh(A + B) = cosh(A) cosh(B) + sinh(A) sinh(B).
Inverse hyperbolic functions
The graphs of the inverse hyperbolic functions sinh−1(x), cosh−1(x), and
tanh−1(x) are given in Figure 8.7.
As cosh(x) is not a one-to-one function, it has no true inverse. However,
if we limit x to zero or positive values only then cosh−1(x) is indeed the
inverse function and cosh−1(cosh(x)) = x. The sinh−1(x) function is
deﬁned for all values of x, but cosh−1(x) is deﬁned for x ⩾1 only and
tanh−1(x) is deﬁned for −1 < x < 1.
As the hyperbolic functions are deﬁned in terms of the exponential
function we might suspect that the inverse would be deﬁned in terms of
the logarithm. The logarithmic equivalences are

⇔

(subtracting 2xey from both sides)

The exponential function
This is now a quadratic equation in ey
(ey)2 −2xey −1 = 0.
Using the formula for solving a quadratic equation, where a = 1, b =
−2x, c = −1 gives
ey = 2x ±

.
Dividing the top and bottom lines by 2 gives
ey = x ±

x2 + 1.
Taking ln of both sides and using ln(ey) = y (ln is the inverse function
of exp) we get
y = ln(x ±

x2 + 1).
We discount the negative sign inside the logarithm, as this would lead to
a negative values, for which the logarithm is not deﬁned. So ﬁnally
sinh−1(x) = ln(x +

x2 + 1).
Calculations
The hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions are often not given in a
calculator. To calculate a hyperbolic function then use the deﬁnitions
cosh(x) = ex + e−x
2
sinh(x) = ex −e−x
2
tanh(x) = sinh(x)
cosh(x) = ex −e−x
ex + e−x
To calculate the inverse hyperbolic functions use their logarithmic
equivalences.
Example 8.10
Calculate the following, and where possible use the
appropriate inverse function to check your result:
(a) sinh(1.444)
(b) tanh−1(−0.5)
(c) cosh(−1)
(d) cosh−1(3)
(e) cosh−1(0)
Solution
From the deﬁnition


(2.0008152)2 + 1)
= 1.444
As this is the original number input into the sinh function we have
found sinh−1(sinh(1.444)) = 1.444, which conﬁrms the accuracy of
our calculation.
(b) To calculate tanh−1(−0.5) use the logarithmic equivalence giving

Check: Use the inverse function of tanh−1, that is, ﬁnd
tanh(−0.5493061) = e−0.5493061 −e0.5493061
e−0.5493061 + e0.5493061 ≈−0.5
This is the original number input to the tanh−1 function and this conﬁrms
the accuracy of our calculation.
(c) cosh(−1) = e−1 + e1
2
≈1.5430806
= 1.543 to 4 s.f.
Check: Use the inverse function of cosh, that is, cosh−1:
cosh−1(1.5430806) = ln(1.5430806 +

1.54308062 −1) ≈1
This is not the number that we ﬁrst started with, which was −1. However,
we know that cosh−1(x) is only a true inverse of cosh(x) if the domain
of cosh(x) is limited to positive values and zero. We did not expect the
inverse to ‘work’ in this case where we started with a negative value.

cosh−1(3) = ln(3 +

≈1.7627472

cosh(1.7627472) = e1.7627472 + e−1.7627472
2
≈3
This conﬁrms the accuracy of our calculation as we have shown
cosh(cosh−1(3)) = 3.
(e) Using the logarithmic deﬁnition of cosh−1 leads to an attempt to
take the square root of a negative number. This conﬁrms that cosh−1(0)
is not deﬁned in R.

differentiation
and integration
We are now able to add the functions y = ex and y = ln(x), y = ax, y =
loga(x), and the hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions to the list
of functions (Table 8.3). By swapping the columns and rearranging some
of the terms in a more convenient fashion, and adding the constant of
integration, we get a list of integrals (Table 8.4).
The methods of differentiation and integration of combined functions,
discussed in Chapters 12 and 13, can equally be applied to exponential
and logarithmic functions.

Rewrite the expression using partial fractions. We need to ﬁnd A and B
so that:
2x −1
(x −3)(x + 1) =
A
(x −3) +
B
(x + 1)
where this should be true for all values of x.
Multiplying by (x −3)(x + 1) gives 2x −1 = A(x + 1) + B(x −3).
This is an identity, so we can substitute values for x:
substitute x = −1
giving −3 = B(−4)
⇔
B = 3/4
substitute x = 3
giving 5 = A(4)
⇔
A = 5/4
Hence,
2x −1

Again, we can use partial fractions. Because of the repeated factor in the
denominator we use both a linear and a squared term in that factor. We
need to ﬁnd A, B, and C so that

where this should be true for all values of x.
Multiply by (x + 2)(2x −1)2 to get
x2 = A(2x −1)2 + B(2x −1)(x + 2) + C(x + 2)
This is an identity, so we can substitute values for x
substitute x = 1

giving 0.25 = C(2.5)
⇔
C = 0.1
substitute x = −2
giving 4 = A(−5)2
⇔
A = 4/25 = 0.16
substitute x = 0
giving 0 = A + B(−1)(2) + C(2).
Using the fact that A = 0.16 and C = 0.1, we get
0 = 0.16−2B+0.2 ⇔0 = 0.36−2B

The exponential function
8.6 Summary

Manyphysicalsituationsinvolveexponentialgrowthordecaywhere
the rate of change of y is proportional to its current value.
2.
All exponential functions, y = at, are such that dy/dt = ky, that
is, the derivative of an exponential function is also an exponential
function scaled by a factor k.
3.
The exponential function y = et has the property that dy/dt = y,
that is, its derivative is equal to the original function:
d
dt (et) = et,
where e ≈2.71828. The inverse function to et is loge(t), which
is abbreviated to ln(t). This is called the natural or Napierian
logarithm.
4.
The general solution to dy/dt = ky is y = y0ekt, where y0 is the
value of y at t = 0.

6.
The hyperbolic cosine (cosh) and hyperbolic sine (sinh) are the even
and odd parts of the exponential function:
ex = cosh(x) + sinh(x)
cosh(x) = ex + e−x
2
sinh(x) = ex −e−x
2
These functions get the name hyperbolic because of their relation-
ship to a hyperbola. The hyperbolic tangent is deﬁned by
tanh(x) = sinh(x)
cosh(x) = ex −e−x
ex + e−x
There are various hyperbolic identities, which are similar to the
trigonometric identities (Table 8.2).
7.
The inverse hyperbolic functions cosh−1(x)(x ⩾1), sinh−1(x),
tanh−1(x)(−1 < x < 1) have the following logarithmic identities:
sinh−1(x) = ln(x +

cosh−1(x) is the inverse of cosh(x) if the domain of cosh(x) is
limited to the positive values of x and zero.
8.
Adding the derivatives and integrals of the exponential, ln, hyper-
bolic and inverse hyperbolic functions to the tables of standard
derivatives and integrals gives Tables 8.3 and 8.4.

Partial fractions can be used to integrate fractional functions such as

Vectors
9.1 Introduction
Many things can be represented by a simple number, for instance, time,
distance, mass, which are then called scalar quantities. Others, however,
are better represented by both their size, or magnitude, and a direction.
Some of these are velocity, acceleration, and force. These quantities are
called vector quantities because they are represented by vectors.
A simple example of a vector is one that describes displacement. Sup-
posing someone is standing in a room with ﬂoor tiles (as in Figure 9.1)
and moving from one position to another can be described by the number
of tiles to the right and the number of tiles towards the top of the page.
In the example, to move from the door to the cupboard can be repre-
sented by (4, 2). This vector consists of two numbers, where the order
of the numbers is important. Moving (4, 2) results in a different ﬁnal
position to that if we move (2, 4). The magnitude of the displacement can
be found by drawing a straight line from the starting position to the ﬁnal
position and measuring the length. From Pythagoras theorem this can be
found as
√
42 + 22 =
√
20 ≈4.47. The direction can be described by an
angle, for instance, the angle made to the wall with the window on it.
This example shows that a two-dimensional vector (2D) can be used
to represent movement on a ﬂat surface. A 2D vector is two numbers,
where the order of the numbers is important.
If the room in Figure 9.1 also had wall tiles then we could represent a
position above the ﬂoor by the number of tiles towards the ceiling. This
three-dimensional (3D) vector can be represented by three numbers. It
can also be represented by the distance travelled and the direction, angles
made to the ﬂoor and the angle made to the wall.
Velocity is an example of a vector quantity. This can be described by
twothings, thespeed, whichistherateofchangeofdistancetravelledwith
respect to time, and also the direction in which it is travelling. Similarly,
force can be described by the size of magnitude of the force and also the
direction in which it operates.
Vectors have their own rules for addition and subtraction. If two forces
of equal magnitude operate on one object then the net effect will depend
on the direction of the forces. If the forces operate in opposite directions
Figure 9.1
A tiled room.
To reach the cupboard from
the door we need to move four
tiles to the right and two tiles
towards the top of the page.
This can be represented by
the vector (4, 2).

they could balance each other out, like two tug-of-war teams in a stale-
mate struggle. Alternatively, they could operate in the same direction or
partially in the same direction and cause the object to have an acceleration.
Figure 9.2
A network
consisting of sides a, b, c, d,
e, f, g, and h.
For the examples of vectors given so far, the maximum dimension of
the vector is three as there are only three spatial dimensions. However,
there are many examples when vectors of higher dimension are useful.
For instance, a path through the network given in Figure 9.2 can be
represented by a list of 1s and 0s to indicate whether each of the edges is
included in the path. A path from S to T can be represented by a vector,
for instance:

Although there are many other types of vectors we will concentrate on
vectors of two or three dimensions, called spatial or geometrical vectors,
used to represent physical quantities in space. Many of the ideas in this
chapterareonlytrueforgeometricalvectorsoftwoandthreedimensional.
As 3D vectors can only be correctly represented by making a 3D model,
it is important to concentrate on understanding 2D vectors as they can be
drawn on a piece of paper allowing results to be checked easily.
9.2 Vectors and
vector
quantities
A vector is a string of numbers, for example,
(1, 2, −1)
(1, 0)
(3, −4, 2, −6, 8)
(2.6, 9, −1.2, 0.3).
The length of the string is called the dimension of the vector. For the
examples given above, the dimensions are 3, 2, 5, and 4, respectively.
The commas can be left out, so the examples given above can be written as
(1 2 −1)
(1 0)
(3 −4 2 −6 8)
(2.6 9 −1.2 0.3).
Vectors may also be written as columns, giving:


1
2
−1




2.6

−1.2
0.3

.
Whether vectors are written as columns or rows only becomes impor-
tant when we look at matrices (Chapter 13). However, the order of the
numbers in the vector is important: (0, 1) is a different vector from (1, 0).
Figure 9.3
A vector is drawn
in a diagram as a line
segment with an arrow to
indicate its direction.
We will mainly deal with 2D or 3D vectors. Vectors are represented
in a diagram by a line segment with an arrow as in Figure 9.3. In printed
material vectors can be represented by bold letters: a. They are also rep-
resented by a or ⃗a or −→
AB, where A and B are points at either end of the
vector.
In the rest of this chapter, we will assume that we are dealing with 2D
or 3D vectors represented in rectangular form, also called Cartesian form.

(a) A two-dimensional rectangular set of axes and the
vector (1, 5). The axes are at right angles and the numbers in the
vector give the x, y translation it represents. (b) A three-dimensional
rectangular set of axes and the vector (2, 3, 1). The axes are at right
angles and the numbers in the vector correspond to the x, y, z
translation it represents.
Figure 9.5
(a) The position vector p = (2, 3) or −→
OP = (2, 3) is used
to represent a point in the plane. The point can be found by
translating from the origin by 2 in the x-direction followed by 3 in the
y-direction; hence, p = (2, 3). (b) The position vector p = (2, 3, 4) is
used to represent a point in space. The point can be found by
translating from the origin by 2 in the x-direction, followed by 3 in the
y-direction, and by 4 in the z-direction; hence, p = (2, 3, 4).
This means that the numbers in the vectors correspond to the x, y, z values
for a set of rectangular axes, as shown in Figure 9.4. This assumption is
important for many of the geometrical interpretations presented here.
Figure 9.6
(a) The vector
t = (2, 3) is used to represent
a translation of the ﬁgure
ABCD. Each of the points
deﬁning the ﬁgure have been
translated by (2,3).
Position vectors and
translation vectors
Vectors can represent points in a plane, as in Figure 9.5(a), or points in
space, as in Figure 9.5(b). These are called position vectors. They can be
thought of as representing a translation from the origin.
Vectors can represent a translation that can be applied to ﬁgures. In
Figure 9.6, a four-sided ﬁgure ABCD has been translated through the
vector (2, 3).
Figure 9.7
The object is
being pulled up the slope
using a force F which has a
direction parallel with the
slope of the hill. There is also
a force due to gravity Fg
acting vertically downwards
and a force at right angles to
the plane, FN.
Vector quantities
Vectors can represent physical quantities that have both a magnitude and
a direction. In Figure 9.7, there is an example of the forces acting on a
body that is being pulled up a slope. By using vectors and vector addition
TLFeBOOK

Vectors
191
the resultant force acting on the body can be found and therefore the
direction in which the body will travel can be found together with the size
oftheacceleration. Otherquantitieswithbothmagnitudeanddirectionare
velocity, acceleration, and moment. Quantities that only have magnitude
and no direction are called scalar quantities and can be represented using
a number, for example, mass and length.
9.3 Addition
and subtraction
of vectors
Addition
To add two vectors, add the corresponding elements of the vectors.
Example 9.1
a = (2, 3)
b = (4, 2)
a + b = (2, 3) + (4, 2) = (2 + 4, 3 + 2) = (6, 5)
c = (1, 3, 1.5)
d = (5, −2, 1)
c+d = (1, 3, 1.5)+(5, −2, 1) = (1+5, 3+(−2), 1.5+1) = (6, 1, 2.5).
Figure 9.8
The resultant or
vector sum of a and b.
If the vectors are represented in the plane then the vector sum can be found
using the parallelogram law, as in Figure 9.8. The resultant or vector sum
of a and b is found by drawing vector a and then drawing vector b from
the tip of vector a which gives the point C. Then a + b can be found by
drawing a line starting at O to the point C. If we imagine walking from
O to A, along vector a, and then from A to C, along vector b, this has the
same effect as walking direct from O to C, along vector c. We can also
use the parallelogram to show that a + b = b + a. To ﬁnd b + a, start
with vector b and draw vector a from the tip of vector b; this also gives
the point C. Then if we walk from O to B along vector b and then from
B to C along vector a, this has the same effect as walking along the other
two sides of the parallelogram or walking direct from O to C. Hence
a + b = b + a = c
Subtraction
To subtract one vector from another, subtract the corresponding elements
of the vectors.
Example 9.2
a = (2, 3)
b = (4, 2)
a −b = (2, 3) −(4, 2) = (2 −4, 3 −2) = (−2, 1).
Using a vector diagram we can perform vector subtraction in two ways.
Draw a and −b and add as before or simply draw vectors a and b from
the same point and the line joining the tip of b to the tip of a gives the
vector a −b. These methods are explained in Figure 9.9.
Example 9.3
In Figure 9.10, −→

EO, and AD is parallel to OC and EF. Write the following vectors in

−b is the vector in the opposite direction. Then add a and −b by

−→
BA gives the vector a −b. To see this imagine walking directly from B
to A, this is the same as walking from B to O, which is backwards
along b and therefore is the vector −b, and then along −→
OA which is
the vector a. Hence, −→
BA = −b + a = a −b.
Solution

OE is the same length as a in the opposite direction; therefore,
−→
OE = −a.
(b)

OC is in the same direction as b, but twice the length; therefore,

OC = 2b.
(c)

BA = −(a −b) = b −a.
(e)

AD is parallel to −→

then −→
AD = 2b.
(f)

BE we need to know −→
OE.−→
OE is the same length as a in
the opposite direction; therefore, −→
OE = −a. To get from B to E we
could go from B to O (−b) and then from O to E (−a); therefore,
−→
BE = −b −a.

BF is the same length as −→
AB and in the same direction; therefore,

BF = −→
AB = b −a.

9.4 Magnitude
and direction of
a 2D vector –
polar
co-ordinates
We have already noted that a vector has magnitude and direction. A
2D vector can be represented by its length (also called magnitude or
modulus), r (or |r|), and its angle to the x-axis, also called its argument, θ.
If the vector is (x, y) then r2 = x2 + y2, from Pythagoras’s theorem The
angle is given by tan−1(y/x) if x is positive and by tan−1(y/x) + π if
x is negative. Hence, r = (r, θ) in polar coordinates, and can also be
written as r∠θ so it is clear that the second number represents the angle.
As it is usual to give the angle between −π and +π, it may be necessary
to subtract 2π from the angle given by this formula. (As a rotation of
2π is a complete rotation this will make no difference to the position of
the vector.)

Find the magnitude and direction of
(a) (2, 3)
(b) (−1, −4)
(c) (1, −2.2)
(d) (−2, 5.6)
Solution
To perform these conversions to polar form it is a good idea
to draw a diagram of the vector in order to be able to check that the angle
is of the correct size. Figure 9.11 shows the diagrams for each part of the
example.
(a)
r = (2, 3) has magnitude
√
22 + 32 ≈3.606 and angle given
by tan−1(3/2) ≈0.983 and therefore in polar coordinates r is
3.606 ∠0.983.
(b)
r = (−1, −4) has magnitude r =
	
(−1)2 + (−4)2 ≈4.123, and
angle given by tan−1(−4/−1)+π ≈1.326+3.142 = 4.467. As this
angle is bigger than π, subtract 2π (a complete revolution) to give
Figure 9.11
Converting vectors to polar form: (a) r = (2, 3) = 3.606 ∠0.983; (b) r = (−1, −4) =
4.123 ∠−1.816; (c) r = (1, −2.2) = 2.416 ∠−1.144; (d) r = (−2, 5.6) = 5.946 ∠1.914.

Vectors
−1.816. Therefore, in polar co-ordinates r = 4.123 ∠−1.816. Note
that the angle is between −π and −π/2, meaning that the vector
must lie in the third quadrant, which we can see is correct from the
diagram.
(c)
r = (1, −2.2) has magnitude r =
	
(1)2 + (−2.2)2 ≈2.416 and
the angle is given by tan−1(−2.2/1) ≈−1.144. Therefore, in polar
co-ordinates r = 2.416 ∠−1.144. Note that the angle is between
−π/2 and 0, meaning that the vector must lie in the fourth quadrant.
(d)
r = (−2, 5.6) has magnitude r =
	
(−2)2 + (5.6)2 ≈5.946 and
angle given by tan−1(5.6/ −2) + π ≈1.914. Therefore, in polar
co-ordinates r = 5.946 ∠1.914. Note that the angle is between π/2
and π, meaning that the vector must lie in the second quadrant.
Many calculators have a rectangular to polar conversion facility. Look
this up on the instructions with your calculator and check the results.
Remember, to get the result in radians you should ﬁrst put your calculator
into radian mode.
Conversion from polar co-ordinates to
rectangular co-ordinates
If a vector is given by its length and angle to the x-axis, that is, r = r∠θ,
then
x = r cos(θ)
y = r sin(θ)
Hence, in rectangular co-ordinates r = (r cos(θ), r sin(θ)).
This result can easily be found from the triangle, as shown in
Figure 9.12; examples are given in Figure 9.13.
Figure 9.12
If a vector, r, is
known in polar co-ordinates,
r = r∠θ then from the triangle
cos(θ) = x/r ⇔x = r cos(θ)
and sin(θ) = y/r ⇔
y = r sin(θ).
Figure 9.13
(a) 4 ∠20◦in rectangular co-ordinates is given by
x = 4 cos(20◦) ≈3.759 and y = 4 sin(20◦) ≈1.368; therefore, the
vector is (3.759, 1.368). (b) 6.5 ∠1.932 in rectangular co-ordinates is
given by x = 6.5 cos(1.932) ≈−2.297 and y = 6.5 sin(1.932) ≈
6.081; therefore, the vector is (−2.297, 6.081).

Adding two vectors expressed in
polar co-ordinates
To add two vectors expressed in polar co-ordinates, ﬁrst express them in
rectangular co-ordinates, then ﬁnd the sum and then convert back into
polar co-ordinates.
Example 9.5
Find 2 ∠20◦+ 4 ∠50◦.
Solution
Using x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ), we can express the two
vectors in rectangular co-ordinates, giving
2 ∠20◦≈(1.879, 0.684)
4 ∠50◦≈(2.5711, 3.064).
Therefore, 2 ∠20◦+ 4 ∠50◦≈(1.879, 0.684) + (2.571, 3.064) =
(4.45, 3.748).
Finally, this can be represented in polar co-ordinates by using
r =
	
x2 + y2 and θ = tan−1(y/x) (+π, if x is negative) giving
(4.45, 3.748) ≈5.818 ∠40.106◦.
Example 9.6
Find 4 ∠1 + 2 ∠−1.6.
Solution
Using x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ), we can express the two
vectors in rectangular co-ordinates, giving 4 ∠1 ≈(2.161, 3.366):
2 ∠−1.6 ≈(−0.058, −1.999).
Therefore, 4 ∠1 + 2 ∠−1.6 ≈(2.161, 3.366) + (−0.058, −1.999) =
(2.103, 1.367).
Finally, this can be represented in polar co-ordinates by using
r =
	
x2 + y2 and θ = tan−1(y/x) (+π, if x is negative), giving
(2.103, 1.367) ≈2.508 ∠0.576.
9.5 Application
of vectors to
represent
waves
(phasors)
In Section 5.3, we found the amplitude, phase, and cycle rate (frequency)
of a wave. f (t) = A cos(ωt + φ) has amplitude A, angular frequency ω,
and phase φ. Suppose we consider waves of a ﬁxed frequency (say 50 Hz
giving ω = 50 × 2π ≈314); then, different waves can be represented
by the amplitude and phase, giving y = A∠φ. The ideas of vectors can
then be used to add and subtract waves and ﬁnd their combined effect.
If a wave can be represented in polar form by A∠φ, then what does
the rectangular form of the vector represent? We ﬁnd that if the wave
is split into cosine and sine terms by using the trigonometric identity
cos(A + B) = cos(A) cos(B) −sin(A) sin(B), we get:
f (t) = A cos(ωt + φ) = A cos(φ) cos(ωt) −A sin(φ) sin(ωt).
As A cos(φ) is a constant, not involving an expression in t, this can be
replaced by c and similarly A sin(φ) can be replaced by d giving
f (t) = c cos(ωt) −d sin(ωt)
where c = A cos(φ) and d = A sin(φ).
So the vector (c, d) used to represent a wave represents the func-
tion f (t) = c cos(ωt) −d sin(ωt) and if expressed in polar form A∠φ
it represents the equivalent expression
f (t) = A cos(ωt + φ)

Vectors
Example 9.7
Express the following as a single cosine term and give the
amplitude and phase of the resultant function:
x = 3 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t).
Solution
Comparing x = 3 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) with the expression
f (t) = c cos(ωt) −d sin(ωt) gives c = 3, d = −2 and ω = 2. Express-
ing the vector (3, −2) in polar form gives 3.605∠−0.588 and hence
x = 3.605 cos(2t −0.588) giving the amplitude as 3.605 and phase
as −0.588.
Check: Expand x = 3.605 cos(2t −0.588) using
cos(A −B) = cos(A) cos(B) + sin(A) sin(B)
3.605 cos(2t −0.588) = 3.605 cos(2t) cos(0.588)
+ 3.605 sin(2t) sin(0.588)
= 3 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t)
which is the original expression.
Example 9.8
Express the following as a single cosine term and hence
give the magnitude and phase of the resultant function:
y = −2 cos(t) −4 sin(t)
Solution
Comparing y = −2 cos(t) −4 sin(t) with the expression
f (t) = c cos(ωt) −d sin(ωt) gives c = −2, d = 4, and ω = 1.
Expressing the vector (−2, 4) in polar form gives 4.472 ∠2.034 and
hence y = 4.472 cos(t + 2.034).
Check: Expand y
=
4.472 cos(t + 2.034) using cos(A + B)
=
cos(A) cos(B) −sin(A) sin(B) : 4.472 cos(t + 2.034) = 4.472 cos(t)
cos(2.034) −4.472 sin(t) sin(2.034) = −2 cos(t) −4 sin(t).
Example 9.9
Express x = 3 cos(20t +5) as the sum of cosine and sine
terms.
Solution
On representing x as the phasor 3 ∠5 with angular frequency
20, 3 ∠5 converts to rectangular form as the vector (0.851, −2.877) and
this now gives the values of (c, d) in the expression f (t) = c cos(ωt) −
d sin(ωt), giving x = 0.851 cos(20t) + 2.877 sin(20t).
Example 9.10
Find the resultant wave found from combining the
following into one term:
f (t) = 3 cos(314t + 0.5) + 2 cos(314t + 0.9).
Solution
As
both
terms
are
of
the
same
angular
frequency,
314 radians s−1, we can express the two component parts by their
amplitude and phase and then add the two vectors, giving 3 ∠0.5+2 ∠0.9.
Expressing
these
in
rectangular
form
gives
(2.633, 1.438) +
(1.243, 1.567) = (3.876, 3.005).
Finally, expressing this again in polar form gives 4.904 ∠0.659, so the
resultant expression is f (t) = 4.904 cos(314t + 0.659).
This method is a shorthand version of writing out all the trigonomet-
ric identities. It is even quicker if you use the polar – rectangular and
rectangular – polar conversion facility on a calculator.

Multiplication of
a vector by a
scalar and unit
vectors
Figure 9.15
The vector
r = (3, 4) has modulus, or
length r =
√
32 + 42 = 5. The
unit vector in the same
direction is found by dividing
the vector r by its length
giving ˆr = 1
5(3, 4) = (0.6, 0.8).
Multiplying a vector by a scalar has the effect of changing the length
without affecting the direction. Each number in the vector is multiplied
by the scalar
Example 9.11
If a = (1, −2) then
3a = 3(1, −2) = (3 × 1, 3 × (−2)) = (3, −6)
0.5a = 0.5(1, −2) = (0.5 × 1, 0.5 × (−2)) = (0.5, −1).
This is shown in Figure 9.14.
Unit vectors
Unit vectors have length 1. They are often represented by vectors with a
cap on them ˆr. Hence, ˆr means the unit vector in the same direction as r.
To ﬁnd the unit vector in the same direction as r, divide r by its length:
ˆr = r/|r|, where |r| represents the magnitude of vector r.
In Section 9.5, we found the length of a 2D vector (x, y) is
	
x2 + y2,
similarly it can be shown that in three dimensions (x, y, z) the length is
	
x2 + y2 + z2.
Example 9.12
Find unit vectors in the direction of the following
vectors:
(a) (1, −1)

(c) (0.5, 1, 0.2).
Solution

Therefore, the unit vector (see Figure 9.15) is

1
1.13578(0.5, 1, 0.2) ≈(0.44, 0.88, 1.176).
9.7 Basis
vectors
Vectors in a plane are made up of a part in the x-direction and a part in
the y-direction, for example, (2, 3) = (2, 0) + (0, 3). i and j are used to
represent unit vectors in the x-direction and y-direction, that is, i = (1, 0)
and j = (0, 1).
Figure 9.16
Any vector in a
plane can be expressed in
terms of the vectors i and j;
for instance, (2, 3) =
2(1, 0) + 3(0, 1) = 2i + 3j.
Any vector in the plane can be expressed in terms of i and j. i and
j are called the Cartesian unit basis vectors, which is the name given
to a co-ordinate system where the axes are at right angles to each other
(orthogonal) (see Figure 9.16):
(2, 3) = 2(1, 0) + 3(0, 1) = 2i + 3j.
The unit vector in the z direction is often given the symbol k; and in
three dimensions, using rectangular axes we have:
i = (1, 0, 0)
j = (0, 1, 0)
k = (0, 0, 1)
that is
(5, −1, 2) = (5, 0, 0) + (0, −1, 0) + (0, 0, 2)
= 5(1, 0, 0) + (−1)(0, 1, 0) + 2(0, 0, 1)
= 5i −j + 2k.
Figure 9.17
A room shaped
as a parallelogram. Any
position in the room can be
found by moving parallel to
the sides. The basis vectors
used are not at right angles.
The vectors i and j form a basis set because all 2D geometrical vectors can
be expressed in such terms. Similarly, all 3D vectors can be expressed in
terms of i, j, and k. There are many other sets of vectors that can be used as
a basis set: for instance, if we were in a room shaped like a parallelogram
we could express any position in the room by moving parallel to one of
the sides and then parallel to the other side. This is shown in Figure 9.17.
Other basis sets are not as useful for interpreting spatial vectors as they
do not give the same geometrical results. For instance, the interpretation
of the scalar product, given in Section 9.8, relies on the fact that we use
Cartesian basis vectors.
9.8 Products of
vectors
There are two products of vectors that are commonly used: the scalar
product, which results in a scalar, and the vector or cross product, which
gives a vector as the result. However, both of these products are irre-
versible: they have no inverse operation. In other words, it is not possible
to divide by a vector.
Scalar product
The scalar product of two vectors is deﬁned by
a · b = (a1, a2) · (b1, b2) = a1b1 + a2b2.
Notice that the scalar product gives a simple number as the result.
TLFeBOOK

Vectors
199
Example 9.13
Find the scalar product of (2, 3) and (1, 2).
Solution
Using the deﬁnition
(2, 3) · (1, 2) = (2)(1) + (3)(2) = 2 + 6 = 8.
Interpretation of the scalar product
The scalar product of a and b is related to the length of the vectors in
the following way: a · b = ab cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the
two vectors and a is the magnitude of a and b is the magnitude of b (see
Figure 9.18).
Figure 9.18
The scalar
product a·b = ab cos(θ)
where θ is the angle between
the two vectors.
The magnitude of a vector is the square root of the dot product with
itself; hence, a · a = a2.
The scalar product can be used to ﬁnd the angle between two vectors.
It can also be used to ﬁnd the length of a vector and can be used to test if
two vectors are at right angles (orthogonal).
Example 9.14
Find the angle between (1, −1) and (3, 2).
Solution
If a = (1, −1) and b = (3, 2), then a · b = (1, −1) · (3, 2) =
(1)(3) + (−1)(2) = 3 −2 = 1.
We now use the relationship
a · b = ab cos(θ) ⇔cos(θ) = a · b
ab
to ﬁnd the angle between the vectors. We ﬁnd the magnitude of a and the
magnitude of b
a =
	
12 + (−1)2 ≈1.414
and
b =
	
32 + 22 ≈3.606.
Hence,
cos(θ) = a · b
ab
becomes
cos(θ) =
1
1.414 × 3.606 ≈0.196
giving θ = cos−1(0.196) ≈1.373 radians.
Example 9.15
Show that (2, −1) and (−0.5, −1) are at right angles.
Solution
If two vectors are at an angle θ, with cos(θ) = 0, then θ =
±90◦, so the vectors are at right angles. Hence, if we ﬁnd that a · b = 0
this shows that a and b are at right angles (as long as one of the vectors
is not the null vector (0, 0)). In this case the scalar product gives:
(2, −1) · (−0.5, −1) = 2(−0.5) + (−1)(−1) = −1 + 1 = 0
As the scalar product of the two vectors is 0 the angle between them is
90◦, so they are at right angles.

Example 9.16
Show that (1, −1) and (−2, −2) are at right angles.
Solution
(1, −1) · (−2, −2) = (1)(−2) + (−1)(−2) = −2 + 2 = 0
Hence, they are at right angles.
Direction cosines
We have seen that the scalar product of two vectors a and b, a · b =
ab cos(θ). We can use this result to show that the components of a unit
vector are the direction cosines of the vector, that is,
ˆr = (cos(α), cos(β))
where α is the angle that the vector makes to the x-axis and β is the angle
that the vector makes to the y-axis.
To show this, consider a unit vector ˆr = (x, y) = xi + yj. If we take
the scalar product with the unit vector along the x-axis, i = (1, 0), we
will get
ˆr · i = (x, y) · (1, 0) = x
and we know that ˆr·i = |ˆr||i| cos(α), where |ˆr| and |i| are the magnitudes
of ˆr and i, respectively, and α is the angle between them. In this case,
as we have two unit vectors their magnitudes are 1. This means that
ˆr · i = cos(α), where α is the angle between the two vectors. In this case,
α is the angle that the vector, ˆr, makes to the x-axis. We have shown that
ˆr · i = cos(α) and we know that ˆr · i = x, so we have that x = cos(α),
where α is the angle to the x-axis. By considering ˆr · j, we ﬁnd that
y = cos(β), where β is the angle that the vector ˆr makes to the y-axis.
So we have that the components of any unit vector ˆr are the direction
cosines of the vector.
If we consider any vector r we can ﬁnd that a unit vector is the same
direction as r by dividing by the magnitude of r. Hence, we have that:
ˆr = r
|r| = (cos(α), cos(β))
where α is the angle the vector r makes to the x-axis and β is the angle
the vector r makes to the y-axis (see Figure 9.19).

In three dimensions we get:
ˆr = r
|r| = (cos(α), cos(β), cos(γ ))
where α is the angle the vector r makes to the x-axis, β is the angle it
makes to the y-axis, and γ the angle it makes to the z-axis.
Example 9.17
Find the angle that the following vectors make to the
axes: (a) (3, 6); (b) (−1, −4, 5).
Solution
(a) r/|r| = (cos(α), cos(β)), where α and β are the angles
made to the x and y axes. Therefore,

≈(0.44721, 0.89443).
The angle made to the x-axis is α = cos−1(0.44721) ≈1.107 and the
angle made to the y-axis is β = cos−1(0.89443) ≈0.463. The angles
made to the x and y axes are 1.107 and 0.463 radians, respectively.

201
(b) r/|r| = (cos(α), cos(β), cos(γ )), where α, β and γ are the angles

(−1)2 + (−4)2 + 52 = (−1, −4, 5)
√
42
≈(−0.1543, −0.61721, 0.77151).
The angles made to axes in the x, y, and z directions are found by
taking the inverse cosines of the above: 1.726, 2.236, 0.6896 radians,
respectively.
Vector components
The scalar product can be used to ﬁnd the component of a vector in a
given direction. This is a useful idea, for instance, if we are resolving
forces and we want to add up all the forces acting in a certain direction.
We can use the dot product with a unit vector in the direction of interest
to ﬁnd the component in that direction. The component of a vector F in
the direction of a vector r is F · (r/|r|)
Example 9.18
A removal company wants to move a piano from the
upstairs window of a small house. A smooth plank is placed against a
wall near the window so that it touches the wall at a height of 4 m and the
base of the plank is 1.5 m from the building. The piano, of mass 800 kg, is
to be slid down the plank while attached by a rope. Taking the acceleration
due to gravity to be g ≈9.81 m s−2, what force is required on the other
end of the rope to hold the piano steady while it is on the plank?

Figure 9.20
Piano on a
plank for Example 9.18.
Solution
We draw the situation as in Figure 9.20 using x and y axes.
The vector that represents the plank goes from (0, 0) to (1.5, 4). This is
the direction vector p = (1.5, 4) −(0, 0) = (1.5, 4).
The acceleration due to gravity is in a vertical direction and is a =
(0, −g). From Newton’s second law the force due to gravity is
F = ma = 800 × (0, −9.81).
The component of the force due to gravity acting along the direction of the
plank is the scalar product of the force with a unit vector in the direction
of the plank, that is
F · p
|p| = 800(0, −9.81).(1.5, 4)
	
(1.5)2 + 42
= 800 −39.24
√
18.25
= −7348 N to 4 s.f.
The −sign indicates that the component of the force due to gravity is
in the opposite direction to the vector p along the plank. In order to hold
the piano steady on the plank, we would need to have a force of equal
magnitude in the opposing direction to be provided by the rope. That is,
we would require a force of 7348 N on the rope.
Vector (or cross) product
The vector product of a and b is deﬁned by a × b = ab sin(θ)ˆn, where ˆn
is the unit vector normal to the plane of a and b and θ is the angle between
a and b.

Figure 9.22
The magnitude of the vector product of two vectors
gives the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors. The area of
OABC is given by |(4, 3) × (7, 0)| = |(4.0) −(3.7)| = |0 −21| = 21
square units.
If a and b are vectors that lie in the x, y plane, the vector product will
be a vector normal to that plane, that is, wholly in the z-direction. It can
be found from the following expression:
(a1, a2, 0) × (b1, b2, 0) = (0, 0, a1b2 −a2b1) = (a1b2 −a2b1)k
where k is the unit vector in the z-direction.
Example 9.19
(1, 2, 0) × (−3, −1, 0) = (0, 0, (1)(−1) −(2)(−3)) =
(0, 0, 5). This is shown in Figure 9.21.
Applications of the vector product
Figure 9.21
The vector
product of two vectors lying in
the x, y plane,
(1, 2, 0) × (−3, −1, 0) =
(0, 0, 5).
The vector product can be used to ﬁnd the area of a parallelogram with
sides OA and OB (see Figure 9.22).
The area of a parallelogram is given by ab sin(θ), where a and b
are the lengths of the sides and θ is the angle between them. Consider
vectors a and b representing the sides of the parallelogram. We know
that a × b = ab sin(θ)ˆn, where ˆn is a unit vector normal to the plane
of a and b. As ˆn is a unit vector it has a magnitude of 1, so |a × b| =
ab sin(θ), which is exactly the same as the formula for the area of the
parallelogram. Therefore, the area of the parallelogram can be found by
taking the magnitude of the vector product of the vectors that deﬁne the
sides of the parallelogram.
As sin(θ) = 0 when θ = 0 or θ = 180◦, the vector product can also
be used to test for parallel vectors (vectors pointing in the same direction
or in exactly opposing directions). Again we only need to consider the
magnitude of the vector product.
Example 9.20
Show that the vectors (0.2, −5) and (−1, 25) are parallel.
Solution
Find |(0.2, −5) × (−1, 25)| = |(0.2 × 25) −(−5 × −1)| =
|5 −5| = 0.
As we know that |a × b| = ab sin(θ), then as a and b are of non-zero
length, |a × b| = 0 ⇔sin(θ) = 0. This shows that the vectors are
parallel.
9.9 Vector
equation of a
line
In Chapter 2, we looked at the equation of a line that we found to be
y = mx +c, where the gradient of the line is m and the line goes through
the point (0, c). We also found that the equation of a line that goes through
two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), is
y −y1
y2 −y1
= x −x1
x2 −x1
.
We would like to be able to express the equation of a line as a vector
equation. If we know that the two points A and B represented by the
TLFeBOOK

Vectors
203
position vectors a and b lie on the line, then a vector in the direction of
the line will be a vector joining those two points, that is, b −a. As the
line must go through A, we can see that any multiple of b −a added to
the position vector a must lie on the line. This is shown in Figure 9.23

If we call the position vector of any point on the line r where r = (x, y),
we now have the vector equation of the line as r = a + λ(b −a) where
λ ∈R.
This can be rewritten as r = a(1 −λ) + λb.
Example 9.21
Find the vector equation of a line through the points
(2, 4) and (0, 6) and show that your result agrees with the equation of the
line y = −x + 6, as found in Example 2.3.
Solution
Using r = a(1 −λ) + λb and a = (2, 4), b = (0, 6), we ﬁnd
r = (2, 4)(1 −λ) + λ(0, 6) = (2(1 −λ) + λ(0), 4(1 −λ) + λ6)
r = (2 −2λ, 4 + 2λ)
To show that this is the same as equation y = −x + 6 use r = (x, y)
(x, y) = (2 −2λ, 4 + 2λ) ⇔x = 2 −2λ and y = 4 + 2λ
This is a parametric equation for the line with parameter λ.
Eliminate λ by rewriting the equation for x so that λ is the subject and
substitute into the equation for y:
x = 2 −2λ ⇔λ = 1
2(2 −x)
Substituting for λ in y = 4 + 2λ gives
y = 4 + 2

(2 −x)
⇔
y = 6 −x
⇔
y = −x + 6
This shows that the vector equation of the line is equivalent to y = −x+6.
9.10 Summary
1.
A vector is a string of numbers where the length of the string is
called the dimension of the vector.
2.
Vectors are used to represent points on a plane or in space, transla-
tions and physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction
(called vector quantities).
3.
The vector sum is found by adding corresponding elements of the
vectors, or from a diagram by using a parallelogram.
4.
To subtract vectors, subtract corresponding elements of the vectors.
A triangle may be used to perform vector subtraction in a diagram.
5.
Two-dimensional vectors r = (x, y) can be expressed in polar
co-ordinates using
r =

x2 + y2
and θ = tan−1(y) (+π, if x is negative), so that (x, y) = r∠θ,
where r or |r|is the magnitude, or length, of the vector and θ is the
TLFeBOOK

Vectors
angle that the vector makes to the x-axis, also called its argument.
To convert from polar to rectangular co-ordinates use:
x = r cos(θ)
and
y = r sin(θ).
To add vectors given in polar form they must ﬁrst be converted to
rectangular form.
6.
Waves of a ﬁxed frequency can be represented by phasors giving the
amplitude and phase. f (t) = A cos(ωt + φ) can be represented by
its amplitude and phase A∠φ. Converting this vector to rectangular
form gives (c,d) where
f (t) = c cos(ωt) −d sin(ωt).
Using ideas of conversion from polar to rectangular form and vector
addition, waves of the same frequency can be easily combined.
7.
Unit vectors have length 1. To ﬁnd the unit vector in the same
direction as a vector r divide the vector by its length:
ˆr = r
|r|.
8.
Any vectors in the plane can be represented in terms of i = (1, 0)
and j = (0, 1) and in three dimensions by i = (1, 0, 0), j = (0, 1, 0),
and k = (0, 0, 1). These are the Cartesian unit basis vectors and
they are at right angles to each other.
9.
Where a = (a1, a2) and b = (b1, b2) are two vectors, the scalar
product is given by a · b = (a1, a2) · (b1, b2) = a1b1 + a2b2 and
a · b = ab cos(θ), where a, b are the magnitudes of the vectors a
and b, and θ is the angle between them. The scalar product can be
used to ﬁnd the angle between two vectors.
10.
The components of any unit vector give the cosines of the angles
that the vector makes to each of the Cartesian axes. Then we have
for any vector r:
ˆr = r
|r| = (cos(α), cos(β))
where α is the angle the vector r makes to the x-axis and β is the
angle it makes to the y-axis. In three dimensions:
ˆr = r
|r| = (cos(α), cos(β), cos(γ ))
where α is the angle the vector r makes to the x-axis, β is the angle
it makes to the y-axis, and γ is the angle it makes to the z-axis.
cos(α), cos(β), and cos(γ ) are called the direction cosines of the
vector.
11.
The scalar product can be used to ﬁnd the component of a vector in
any given direction. Component of a vector F in the direction of a
vector r = F · (r/|r|).
12.
The vector product is given by a × b = ab sin(θ)ˆn, where a and b
are the magnitudes of the vectors a and b, θ is the angle between
them, and ˆn is a unit vector normal to the plane of a and b. If a
and b are vectors in the x, y plane, that is, a = (a1, a2, 0) and
b = (b1, b2, 0), we have
(a1, a2, 0) × (b1, b2, 0) = (0, 0, a1b2 −a2b1) = (a1b2 −a2b1)k
where k is the unit vector in the z-direction. The magnitude of the
vector product can be used to ﬁnd the area of a parallelogram.
13.
The vector equation of a line passing through two points a and b is
r = a(1 −λ) + λb
λ ∈R

Introduction
In the previous chapter, we have shown that a single frequency wave
can be represented by a phasor. We begin this chapter with a brief look
at linear system theory. Such systems, when the input is a single fre-
quency wave, produce an output at the same frequency which may be
phase shifted with a scaled amplitude. Using complex numbers the sys-
tem can be represented by a number which multiplies the input phasor
having the effect of rotating the phasor and scaling the amplitude. We can
deﬁne j as the number which rotates the phasor by π/2 without changing
the amplitude. If this multiplication is repeated, hence rotating the phasor
by (π/2) + (π/2) = π, then the system output will be inverted. In this
way we can get the fundamental deﬁnition j2 = −1. j is clearly not a real
number as any real number squared is positive. j is called an imaginary
number.
The introduction of imaginary numbers allows any quadratic equa-
tion to be solved. In previous chapters we said that the equation
ax2 + bx + c = 0 had no solutions when the formula leads to an attempt
to take the square root of a negative number. The introduction of the num-
ber j makes square roots of negative numbers possible and in these cases
the equation has complex roots. A complex number, z, has a real and
imaginary part, z = x +jy where x is the real part and y is the imaginary
part. Real numbers are represented by points on a number line. Complex
numbers need a whole plane to represent them.
We shall look at operations involving complex numbers, the conversion
between polar and Cartesian (rectangular) form and the application of
complex numbers to alternating current theory.
By looking at the problem of motion in a circle, we show the equiv-
alence between polar and exponential form of complex numbers and
represent a wave in complex exponential form. We can also obtain for-
mulae for the sine and cosine in terms of complex exponentials, and we
solve complex equations zn = c, where c is a complex number.
10.2 Phasor
rotation by π/2
In system theory, a system is represented (Figure 10.1) as a box with
an input and an output. We think about the system after it has been in
operation for a length of time, so any initial switching effects have
disappeared.
Figure 10.1
A system is
characterized by a box with
an input and output.
Of particular importance are systems which, when the input is a single
frequency wave, produce an output, at the same frequency that can be
characterized by a phase shift and a change of amplitude of the wave.
Examples of such systems are electrical circuits which are made up of
lumped elements, that is, resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Here the
input and output are voltages. Such a system is shown in Figure 10.2(a).
Equivalent mechanical systems are made up of masses, springs and
dampers, and the input and output is the external force applied and the

(a) A system which produces a phase shift

represented as a multiplication by j. (b) A system
consisting of two sub-systems, both of which produce a
phase shift of π/2 giving a combined shift of π. As a phase
shift of π inverts a wave, that is, cos(ωt + π) = −cos(ωt)
this is equivalent to multiplication by −1. Hence, j × j = −1.
tension in the spring. An example of such a mechanical system is shown
in Figure 10.2(b).
We saw in Chapter 9 that a single frequency wave can be characterized
by its amplitude and phase and these can be represented by vectors, called
phasors. The advantage of complex numbers is that a phasor can be
treated as a number and the system can be represented also by a number
multiplying the input phasor.
Consider a single frequency input of 0 phase and amplitude 1. If there
is a system which has the effect of simply shifting the phase by π/2,
then we represent this by the imaginary number j. So j × 1∠0 = 1∠π/2.
This system is shown in Figure 10.3(a). Supposing now we consider a
system which can be broken into two components both of which shift the
phase by π
2 as shown in Figure 10.3(b). The combined effect of the two
systems is to multiply the input by j × j. The ﬁnal output wave, shifted
now by π, is the cos(ωt + π) = −cos(ωt) so it is −1 times the initial
input. For this to be so then j × j = −1.
This is the central deﬁnition for complex numbers:
j × j = −1
meaning that j =
√
−1, where j is an operator which rotates a phasor
by π/2.
We will return to these linear time-invariant systems in Chapter 16.
10.3 Complex
numbers and
operations
Complex numbers allow us to ﬁnd solutions to all quadratic equations.
Equations like x2 + 4 = 0 do not have real roots because
x2 + 4 = 0 ⇔x2 = −4
and there is no real number, which if squared will give −4.
TLFeBOOK

208
Complex numbers
If we introduce new numbers by using j =
√
−1, then a solution to
x2 + 4 = 0 is x = j2. j2 is an imaginary number. To check that j2 is in
fact a solution to x2 + 4 = 0, substitute it into the equation x2 + 4 = 0,
to give
(j2)2 + 4 = 0 ⇔j2(2)2 + 4 = 0
⇔(−1)(4) + 4 = 0 using j2 = −1
⇔0 = 0
which is true.
Therefore, x = j2 is a solution. In order to solve all possible quadratic
equations we need to use complex numbers, that is numbers that have
both real and imaginary parts. Mathematicians often use i instead of j to
represent
√
−1. However, j is used in engineering work to avoid confusion
with the symbol for the current.
Real and imaginary parts and
the complex plane
A complex number, z, can be written as the sum of its real and imaginary
parts:
z = a + jb
where a and b are real numbers.
The real part of z is a (Re(z) = a). The imaginary part of z is
b(Im(z) = b).
Complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane (often
called an Argand diagram) as the points (x, y) where
z = x + jy
for example, z = 1 −j2 is shown in Figure 10.4. The methods used for
visualizing and adding and subtracting complex numbers is the same as
that used for two-dimensional vectors in Chapter 9.
Figure 10.4
The number
z = 1 −j2. The real part is
plotted along the x-axis and
the imaginary part along the
y-axis.
Equality of two complex numbers
Two complex numbers can only be equal if their real parts are equal and
their imaginary parts are equal.
Example 10.1
If a −2 + jb = 6 + j2, where a and b are known to be
real numbers, then ﬁnd a and b
Solution
a −2 + jb = 6 + j2
We know that a and b are real, so
a −2 = 6
(real parts must be equal)
⇔a = 8
b = 2
(imaginary parts must be equal)
TLFeBOOK

Complex numbers
209
Check by substituting a = 8 and b = 2 into
a −2 + jb = 6 + j2
which gives
8 −2 + j2 = 6 + j2
⇔6 + j2 = 6 + j2
which is correct
Addition of complex numbers
To add complex numbers, add the real parts and the imaginary parts.
Example 10.2
Given z1 = 3 + j4 and z2 = 1 −j2, ﬁnd z1 + z2.
Solution
z1 + z2 = 3 + j4 + 1 −j2 = (3 + 1) + j(4 −2) = 4 + j2

Subtraction of complex numbers
To subtract complex numbers, we subtract the real and imaginary parts.
Example 10.3

Solution
z1 −z2 = 3 + j4 −(1 −j2) = 3 −1 + j(4 −(−2)) = 2 + j6.
On the Argand diagram, reverse the vector z1 to give −z2 and then add
z1 and −z2 as in Figure 10.6.
Figure 10.6
To ﬁnd z1 −z2
on an Argand diagram,
reverse vector z2 to give −z2
and then add giving z1 + −z2.
Multiplication of complex numbers
To multiply complex numbers multiply out the brackets, as for any other
expression, and remember that j2 = −1.
Example 10.4
Given z1 = 3 + j4 and z2 = 1 −j2, ﬁnd z1 · z2.
Solution
z1z2 = (3 + j4)(1 −j2) = 3 + j4 + 3(−j2) + (j4)(−j2)
= 3 + j4 −j6 −j28
= 3 −j2 + 8
(using j2 = −1)
= 11 −j2.
TLFeBOOK

Example 10.5
Find (4 −j2)(8 −j).
Solution
Multiplying as before gives
(4 −j2)(8 −j) = 32 −j16 −j4 + (−j2)(−j)
= 32 −j20 + j22
Using j2 = −1 gives 32 −j20 −2 = 30 −j20
The complex conjugate
The complex conjugate of a number, z = x +jy, is the number with equal
real part and the imaginary part negated. This is represented by z∗:
z∗= x −jy
A number multiplied by its conjugate is always real and positive (or zero).
For example, z = 3 + j4 ⇔z∗= 3 −j4.
zz∗= (3 + j4)(3 −j4) = (3)(3) + ( j4)3 + 3(−j4) + ( j4)(−j4)
= 9 + j12 −j12 −j216
= 9 −j216 = 9 + 16 = 25
(using j2 = −1).
Note that the conjugate of the conjugate takes you back to the original
number.
z = 3 + j4
z∗= 3 −j4
z∗∗= 3 + j4 = z
The conjugate of a number can be found on an Argand diagram by
reﬂecting the position of the number in the real axis (see Figure 10.7).
Figure 10.7
The complex
conjugate of a number can be
found by reﬂecting the
number in the real axis in the
diagram are shown. The
diagram shows 1 −j2 and its
conjugate 1 + j2.
Example 10.6
Find complex conjugates of the following and show that
zz∗is real and positive, or zero, in each case
(a) 2 −j5
(b) −4 + j2
(c) −5
(d) j6
(e) a + jb,
where a and b are real.
Solution
(a) The conjugate of 2 −j5 is
(2 −j5)∗= 2 + j5
Hence
zz∗= (2 −j5)(2 + j5) = (2)(2) + (−j5)2 + 2( j5) + (−j5)( j5)
= 4 −j10 + j10 −j225
= 4 −j225
(using j2 = −1)
= 4 + 25 = 29
which is real and positive. We have shown that 2 −j5 multiplied by its
conjugate 2 + j5 gives a real, positive number.

= 16 −j8 + j8 −j24
= 16 −j24
(using j2 = −1)
= 16 + 4 = 20
which is real and positive.
(c) −5 is a real number and therefore its complex conjugate is the same:
−5. (−5)∗= −5 and (−5)(−5) = 25, which is real and positive.
(d) (j6)∗= −j6
(j6)(−j6) = −j236 = 36
which is real and positive.
(e) (a + jb)∗= a −jb
(a + jb)(a −jb) = (a)(a) + (jb)(a) + (a)(−jb) + (jb)(−jb)
= a2 + jab −jab −j2b2 = a2 −j2b2
using j2 = −1, this gives a2 + b2
As a and b are real, this must be a real number. Also, we know that the
square of a real number is greater than or equal to 0. So a2 + b2 is real,
and it is positive if a ̸= 0, b ̸= 0 or zero if both a and b are zero.
It is a good idea to remember this last result that a + jb multiplied by
its conjugate, a −jb, gives a2 + b2. That is, any number multiplied by
its complex conjugate gives the sum of the square of the real part and the
square of the imaginary part. This is the same as the value of the modulus
of z squared,that is,
zz∗= |z|2.
Division of complex numbers
To divide complex numbers, we use the fact that a number times its
conjugate is real to transform the bottom line of the fraction to a real
number. If we multiply the bottom line by its complex conjugate, we must
also multiply the top line in order not to change the value of the number.

Given z1 = 3 + j4 and z2 = 1 −j2, ﬁnd z1/z2.
Solution

line entirely real. Hence, we get

In Chapter 2 of the Background Mathematics Notes available on the com-

where a, b and c are real numbers and said that the solutions are given by
the formula
x = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
We discovered that there are no real solutions if b2 −4ac < 0 because
we would need to take the square root of a negative number. We can now
ﬁnd complex solutions in this case by using j =

Solution

real, must be the complex conjugates of each other. This is true for all the
cases we looked at in Example 10.9.
x2 + 3x + 5 = 0
has solutions x = −1.5 + j1.658 and x = −1.5 −j1.658.
x2 −x + 1 = 0
has solutions x = 0.5 + j0.866 and x = 0.5 −j0.866.
4x2 + 1 = 0
has solutions x = j0.5 and x = −j0.5.
We can show that if the coefﬁcients a, b, and c are real in the equation
ax2 + bx + c = 0, then the roots of the equation must either be real or
complex conjugates of each other. We know from the formula that

as

where p and q are real.
This shows that the two solutions are complex conjugates of each other.
This fact can be used to ﬁnd the other root when one root is known.

TLFeBOOK

Complex numbers
215
Solution
We know that non-real solutions must be complex conjugates
of each other so if one solution is x = 2 −j2 the other one must be
x = 2+j2. To ﬁnd k, we use the result that if an equation has exactly two
solutions x1 and x2, then the equation must be equivalent to (x −x1)(x −
x2) = 0. We know that x = 2 + j2 or x = 2 −j2, therefore, the equation
must be equivalent to
(x −(2 + j2))(x −(2 −j2)) = 0.
Multiplying out the brackets gives:
x2 −x(2 + j2) −x(2 −j2) + (2 + j2)(2 −j2) = 0
⇔x2 + x(−2 −j2 −2 + j2) + (4 + 4) = 0
⇔x2 −4x + 8 = 0
Compare x2 −4x +8 = 0 with x2 −kx +8 = 0. The coefﬁcient of x2
are equal in both cases, as are the constant terms, so the equations would
be the same if −k = −4 ⇔k = 4, giving the solution as k = 4.
10.5 Polar form
of a complex
number
From the Argand diagram in Figure 10.8, we can see that a complex
number can be expressed in terms of the length of the vector (the modulus)
and the angle it makes with the x-axis (the argument). This is exactly the
same process as that as in expressing vectors in polar coordinates as in
Section 9.4.
Figure 10.8
The number
x + jy can be expressed in
polar form by the length of the
line representing the number,
r, and the angle it makes to
the x axis, θ; that is,
x + jy = r∠θ.
If z = x + jy then z can be represented in polar form as r∠θ where
r2 = x2 + y2
tan(θ) = y
x
Hence
r =

x2 + y2,
θ = tan−1 y
x

(+π if x is negative)
We can write the complex number as
z = r∠θ
r, the modulus of z, is also written as |z|.
As it is usual to give the angle between −π and π, it may be necessary
to subtract 2π from the angle given by this formula. As 2π is a complete
rotation, this will make no difference to the position of the complex
number on the diagram.
Example 10.11
Express the following complex numbers in polar form
(a) 3 + j2
(b) −2 −j5
(c) −4 + j2
(d) 4 −j2
Solution
To perform these conversions to polar form, it is a good idea
to draw a diagram of the number in order to check that the angle is of the
correct size (see Figure 10.9).
(a)
3 + j2 has modulus r =
√
32 + 22 ≈3.61 and the angle is given by
tan−1(2/3); therefore, in polar form 3 + j2 ≈3.61∠0.59

(c) −4 + j2 ≈4.47∠2.68; (d) 4 −j2 ≈4.47∠−0.46.
(b)
−2−j5 has modulus r =

(−2)2 + (−5)2 ≈5.39 and the angle is
given by tan−1(−5/(−2))+π ≈4.332. As this angle is bigger than
2π, subtract 2π (a complete revolution) to give −1.95. Therefore,
in polar form −2 −j5 ≈5.39∠−1.95. Note that the angle is
between −π and −π/2, meaning that the number must lie in the
third quadrant, which we can see is correct from the diagram.
(c)
−4 + j2 has modulus r =

(−4)2 + 22 ≈4.47 and the angle is
given by tan−1(2/(−4)) + π ≈−0.46 + π ≈2.68. Therefore, in
polar form −4+j2 ≈4.47∠2.68. Note that the angle is between π/2
and π, meaning that the number must lie in the second quadrant,
which we can see is correct from the diagram.
(d)
4 −j2 has modulus r =

(4)2 + (−2)2 ≈4.47 and the angle is
given by tan−1(−2/4) ≈−0.46. Therefore, in polar form 4 −j2 ≈
4.47∠−0.46. Note that the angle is between −π/2 and 0 meaning
that the number must lie in the fourth quadrant, which we can see
is correct from the diagram.
Check the calculations by using the rectangular to polar conversion
facility on your calculator.
Conversion from polar form to
Cartesian (rectangular) form
If a number is given by its modulus and argument, in polar form, r∠θ,
we can convert back to Cartesian (rectangular) form using:
x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ)
TLFeBOOK

Complex numbers
217
This can be seen from Figure 10.10 and examples are given in
Figure 10.11. As z = x + jy, z = r cos(θ) + jr sin(θ) = r(cos(θ) +
j sin(θ)).
Figure 10.10
The number
r∠θ can be written as x + jy.
Using the triangle,
cos(θ) = x/r giving
x = r cos(θ). Also
sin(θ) = y/r giving
y = r sin(θ).
Figure 10.11
(a) 5∠30◦in
Cartesian (rectangular) form
is given by x = 5 cos(30◦) ≈
4.33, y = 5 sin(30◦) = 2.5,
therefore,
5∠30◦≈4.33 + j2.5.
(b) 2.2∠1.86 in rectangular
form is given by
x = 2.2 cos(1.86) ≈−0.627
and y = 2.2 sin(1.86) ≈2.1,
therefore,
2.2∠1.86 ≈−0.627 + j2.1.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division of complex numbers in
polar form
To add and subtract two complex numbers, always express them ﬁrst in
rectangular form; that is, write as z = a + jb. The result of the addition
or subtraction then can be converted back to polar form.
To multiply two numbers in polar form, multiply the moduli and add
the arguments.
To divide two numbers in polar form divide the moduli and subtract
the arguments.
Example 10.12
Given
z1 = 3∠π/6
z2 = 2∠π/4
Find z1 + z2, z1 −z2, z1z2, and z1/z2.
Solution
To ﬁnd z1 + z2 use r∠θ = r(cos(θ) + j sin(θ))
z1 = 3(cos(π/6) + j sin(π/6)) ≈2.5981 + j1.5
z2 = 2(cos(π/4) + j sin(π/4)) ≈1.4142 + j1.4142
z1 + z2 ≈2.5981 + j1.5 + 1.4142 + j1.4142
= 4.0123 + j2.9142.
To express z1 + z2 back in polar form, use r =

x2 + y2 and
θ = tan−1(y/x) (+π if x is negative).
r =

4.01232 + 2.91422 ≈4.959,
θ = tan−1(2.9142/4.0123) ≈0.6282
Hence, z1 + z2 ≈4.959∠0.6282.
To ﬁnd z1 −z2, we already have found (above) that z1 = 3∠π/6 ≈
2.5981 + j1.5 and z2 = 2∠π/4 ≈1.4142 + j1.4142. So z1 −z2 ≈
2.5981 + j1.5 −(1.4142 + j1.4142) = 1.1839 + j0.0858.
To express z1 −z2 back in polar form use, r =

x2 + y2 and θ =
tan−1(y/x) (+π if x is negative).
Then z1 −z2 ≈1.1839 + j0.0858 ≈1.187∠0.0723.
To ﬁnd z1z2, multiply the moduli and add the arguments:
z1z2 = 3∠π/6 · 2∠π/4 = (3) · (2)∠((π/6) + (π/4)) = 6∠5π/12.
To ﬁnd z1/z2, divide the moduli and subtract the arguments:
z1
z2
= 3∠π/6
2∠π/4 = 3
2∠((π/6) −(π/4)) = 1.5∠−π/12.

Applications of
complex
numbers to AC
linear circuits
An alternating current (AC) electrical circuit consisting of resistors,
capacitors, and inductors can be analysed using the relationship
V = ZI
where V is the voltage, Z the impedance, and I the current and V , Z, and
I are all complex quantities.
Figure 10.12
(a) Components in series.
(b) components in parallel.
Each component has a complex impedance associated with it and for
two components in series, as in Figure 10.12(a), the resultant impedance
ZR is found by the formula
ZR = Z1 + Z2
For two components in parallel, as in Figure 10.12(b), the resultant
impedance is given by
1
ZR

In the case of parallel circuit elements, it may be easier to calculate the
admittance, the reciprocal of the impedance Y = 1/Z. Then use the fact
that for circuit elements in parallel
YR = Y1 + Y2 and V = I/Y.
The real part of Z is called the resistance and the imaginary part is
called the reactance.
Z = R + jS
where R is the resistance in ohms and S is the reactance in ohms.
The impedances of circuit elements are as follows:

where ω is the angular frequency of the source, ω = 2πf , f is the
frequency in Hz, R is the resistance (in ohms) , C is the capacitance (in
farads), and L is the impedance (in henries).

Solution
The impedances of the elements are shown in Figure 10.13(b).

V = ZI or V = I/Y, we have
V =

0.086∠88◦≈139.6∠−88◦
giving a voltage amplitude of 139.6 V with a relative phase of −88◦.
10.7 Circular
motion
When we introduced the sine and cosine function in Chapter 5, we used
the example of a rotating rod of length r. We plotted the position of
the rod, its height, and horizontal distance from the centre against the
angle through which the rod had rotated. This deﬁned the sine and cosine
functions. We consider this problem again. This time we specify that
the circular motion is at constant angular velocity ω. That is, the rate of
change of the angle θ, dθ/dt, is constant and equals ω. That is:
dθ
dt = ω
(where ω is a constant)
⇔
θ = ωt + φ
where φ is the angle when t = 0. If we start with the rod horizontal, then
φ = 0 and we have θ = ωt. The (x, y) position of the tip of the rod of
length r is given as a function of time by x = r cos(ωt) and y = r sin(ωt),
where ω is the constant angular velocity, so the rotating vector is given
by r = (r cos(ωt), r sin(ωt)) with θ = ωt.
Consider now a ball on the end of a string with constant angular veloc-
ity ω. Can we obtain an expression for its acceleration? The acceleration
is of particular importance because we know from Newton’s second law
TLFeBOOK

Complex numbers
Figure 10.15
A ball on a
string is moving round a circle
with constant angular velocity
so that θ = ωt. If we observe
the ball from the position of
the eye in (a) then we can
only see the motion in the
horizontal direction and the
ball appears to oscillate back
and forth as shown in (b).
Also displayed is the graph of
x against time,
t : x = r cos(ωt).
that the force required to maintain the circular motion can be found by
using F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the accel-
eration. We assume, in this discussion, that the effects of gravity and air
resistance are negligible. The ball is being rotated in a plane which is
vertical to the ground.
First, imagine lying ﬂat on the ground in a line with the x-axis and
watching the ball. It appears to oscillate back and forth and its position
is given by x = r cos(ωt). This is pictured in Figure 10.15.
Differentiating with respect to t gives the component of the velocity in
the x-direction
dx
dt = −rω sin(ωt).
The acceleration is the derivative of this velocity
d
dt
dx
dt

.
This is also written as d2x/dt2 (read as ‘d two x by dt squared’) and it
means the derivative of the derivative
dx
dt = −rω sin(ωt)
differentiating again gives
d2x
dt2 = −rω2 cos(ωt) = −ω2(r cos(ωt))
and as x = r cos(ωt)
d2x
dt2 = −ω2x.
This equation tells us that the horizontal acceleration is proportional to
the horizontal distance from the origin in a direction towards the origin.
This type of behaviour is called simple harmonic motion.
We can consider the movement in the y-direction by changing our
point of view as in Figure 10.16. Again we can ﬁnd the component of the
acceleration, this time in the y-direction.
TLFeBOOK

Complex numbers
221
Figure 10.16
If we observe the ball from the position of the eye in Figure 10.16(a), we can only see the
motion in the vertical direction and the ball appears to oscillate up and down as shown in Figure 10.16(b).
Also shown is the graph of y against time, t : y = r sin(ωt).
We differentiate y = r sin(ωt) to get the component of velocity in the
y-direction:
dy
dt = rω cos(ωt)
Differentiate again to ﬁnd the acceleration:
d2y
dt2 = −rω2 sin(ωt)
and as y = r sin(ωt)
d2y
dt2 = −ω2y
Notice that this is the same equation as we had for x. We can represent
the motion, both in the x- and y-directions by using a complex number
to represent the rotating vector. The real part of z represents the position
in the x-direction and the imaginary part of z represents the position in
the y-direction:
z = x + jy = r cos(ωt) + jr sin(ωt)
Then
dz
dt = −rω sin(ωt) + jrω cos(ωt)
The real part of dz/dt represents the component of velocity in the
x-direction and the imaginary part represents the velocity in the y-
direction. Again, we can differentiate to ﬁnd the acceleration
d2z
dt2 = −rω2 cos(ωt) −jrω2 sin(ωt)
= −ω2(r cos(ωt) + jr sin(ωt)) = −ω2z
as
z = r cos(ωt) + jr sin(ωt)
So, we get
d2z
dt2 = −ω2z
This shows that the acceleration operates along the length of the vector
z towards the origin and it must be of magnitude |−ω2z| = ω2r where r is
TLFeBOOK

Complex numbers
the radius of the circle. The ball is always accelerating towards the centre
ofthecircle. Thisalsotellsustheforcethatthestringmustprovideinorder
to maintain the circular motion at constant angular velocity. The force
towards the centre, called the centripetal force, must be |F| = mω2r,
where r is the radius of the circle and m is the mass of the ball. This has
been given by Newton’s second law F = ma.
We can use the equation for circular motion to show that it is possible
to represent a complex number, z, in the form z = r ejθ, where r is
the modulus and the argument. To do this we must ﬁrst establish the
conditions which determine a particular solution to the equation
d2z
dt2 = −ω2z
We know that one solution of the differential equation
d2z
dt2 = −ω2z
with the condition that z = r when t = 0, is given by z = r cos(ωt) +
jr sin(ωt). Unfortunately, there is at least one other solution, given by the
case where the string travels clockwise rather than anti-clockwise, that is,
z = r cos(−ωt)+jr sin(−ωt). However, we can pin down the solution to
the anti-clockwise direction of rotation by using the fact that we deﬁned
the angular velocity by dθ/dt = ω. This gives a condition on the initial
velocity (at t = 0). From Figure 10.17 we can see that the velocity must
be positive and only have a component in the y-direction at t = 0.
Figure 10.17
The initial
velocity vector (as shown)
must be in the positive y
direction if the motion is
anti-clockwise.
This discounts the possibility of the motion being clockwise as this
would give a negative initial velocity. From z = r cos(ωt) + jr sin(ωt)
dz
dt = −rω sin(ωt) + jrω cos(ωt)dt
and at t = 0, dz/dt = jrω. We now have enough information to say that
d2z
dt2 = −ω2z and z = r
when t = 0
and
dz
dt = jωr when t = 0
⇔
z = r cos(ωt) + jr sin(ωt)
In Chapter 8 we looked at the exponential function and we found that
y = y0 ekt is a solution to the equation dy/dt = ky. This equation models
the situation where the rate of change of the population is proportional to
its current size: the ﬁrst derivative of y is proportional to y. The equation
d2z
dt2 = −ω2z
is similar only now the acceleration is related to z, that is the second
derivative is proportional to z. As the exponential functions have the
property that the derivative gives a scaled version of the original function,

twice. So we can try a solution of the form z = r ekt for the equation
d2z
dt2 = −ω2z
z = r ekt
⇒dz
dt = rk ekt
⇒d2z
dt2 = rk2 ekt
Substituting into
d2z
dt2 = −ω2z
we get
rk2 ekt = −ω2r ekt
Dividing both sides by r ekt gives k2 = −ω2 ⇔k = ±jω.
This gives two possible solutions: z = r ejωt when k = jω and z =
r e−jωt when k = −jω. Again, we can use the initial velocity to determine
the solution. Using z = r ejωt we get
dz
dt = jrω ejωt
at t = 0 then we get the velocity as jωr, which was one of the conditions
we wanted to fulﬁl.
This shows that the two expression z = r ejωt and z = r cos(ωt) +
jr sin(ωt) both satisfy
d2z
dt2 = −ω2z and z = r
when t = 0
and
dz
dt = jωr
when t = 0.
We have stated that these initial conditions are enough to determine
the solution of the differential equation. So, the only possibility is that
r ejωt = r cos(ωt) + jr sin(ωt)
This shows the equivalence of the polar form of a complex number and the
exponential form. Replacing ωt by θ, we get r ejθ = r cos(θ)+jr sin(θ),
which we recognize as the polar form for a complex number z = r∠θ
where r is the modulus and θ is the argument. We can represent any
complex number z = x + jy in the form r ejθ. r and θ are found, as given
before for the polar form, by
r =

Conversely, to express a number given in exponential form in rectangular
(Cartesian) form, we can use r ejθ = r cos(θ) + jr sin(θ).

where z = 2 when t = 0 and dz/dt = j6 when t = 0.
Solution
If z = 2 ej3t, then when t = 0, z = 2 e0 = 2
dz
dt = 2( j3)ej3t = j6ej3t
when t = 0
dz
dt = j6e0 = j6.
Hence
d2z
dt2 = j6(j3)ej3t
⇒
d2z
dt2 = −18ej3t
Substituting into d2z/dt2 = −9z gives −18 ej3t
= −9(2 ej3t) ⇔
−18 ej3t = −18 ej3t, which is true.

Example 10.17
Find the real and imaginary parts of the following
(a) 3 ej(π/2)
(b) e−j
(c) e3+j2
(d) e−j( j−1)
(e) jj
Solution
(a) Use r ejθ = r cos(θ) + jr sin(θ) · 3 ej(π/2) has r = 3 and
θ = π/2
3 ej(π/2) = 3 cos(π/2) + j3 sin(π/2)
= 3.0 + j(3)(1) = j3
The real part is 0 and the imaginary part is 3.
(b) Comparing e−j with rejθ gives r = 1 and θ = −1. Using r ejθ =
r cos(θ) + jr sin(θ)
e−j = 1 cos(−1) + j sin(−1)
≈0.5403 −j0.8415
So the real part of e−j is approximately 0.5403 and the imaginary part is
approximately −0.8415.

(c) Notice that e3+j2 is not in the form r ejθ because the exponent has a
real part. We therefore split the exponent into its real and imaginary bits
by using the rules of powers:
e3+j2 = e3ej2
e3 ≈20.09 is a real number, and the remaining exponent j2 is purely
imaginary:
e3ej2 ≈20.09 ej2
Comparing e3ej2 with rejθ gives r = e3 and θ = 2. Using rejθ =
r cos(θ) + jr sin(θ) gives
e3ej2 = e3 cos(2) + je3 sin(2)
≈−8.359 + j18.26
The real part of e3+j2 is approximately −8.359 and the imaginary part is
approximately 18.26.
(d) For e−j(j−1) we need ﬁrst to write the exponent in a form that allows
us to split it into its real and imaginary bits. So, we remove the brackets
to give
e−j(j−1) = e−j2+j
Using j2 = −1, this gives
e−j(j−1) = e1+j
Now, using the rules of powers we can write
e1+j = e1ej. e1 is a real number and the exponent of ej is purely
imaginary. Comparing e1ej with rejθ gives r = e1 and θ = 1. Using
rejθ = r cos(θ) + jr sin(θ) gives
e1ej1 = e1 cos(1) + je1 sin(1)
≈1.469 + j2.287
The real part of e−j(j−1) is approximately 1.469 and the imaginary part
is approximately 2.287
(e) jj looks a very confusing number as we have only dealt with complex
powers when the base is e. We therefore begin by looking for a way of
rewriting the expression so that its base is e. To do this, we write the base,
j, in exponential form. From the Argand diagram in Figure 10.18, as j is
represented by the point (0,1) we can see that that it has modulus 1 and
argument π/2. Hence, j = ej(π/2).
Use this to replace the base in the expression jj so that
jj =

ej(π/2)j = ej2(π/2) = e−π/2. We can now see that jj is in fact a
real number!
jj = e−π/2 ≈0.2079.
The real part of jj is approximately 0.2079 and the imaginary part is 0.
Figure 10.18
j is
represented by the point (0, 1)
in the complex plane.
Therefore, it has modulus 1
and argument π/2, that is,
j = ej(π/2).

10.8 The
importance of
being
exponential
We have shown that
r ejθ = r cos(θ) + jr sin(θ) = r∠θ
Here r is the modulus of the complex number and θ is the argument.
Therefore, the exponential form is simply another way of writing the polar
form. The advantage of the exponential form is its simplicity. For circular
motion, at constant angular velocity, it can represent the motion both in
the real and imaginary (x and y) directions in one simple expression
r ejωt. The rules for multiplication and powers of complex numbers in
exponentialformaregivenbytherulesofpowers, asforanyothernumber,
given in Chapter 4 of the Background Notes in Mathematics available on
the companion website for this book, thus conﬁrming the rules that we
gave for the polar form.
Multiplication:
r1 ejθ1r2 ejθ2 = r1r2 ej(θ1+θ2)
That is, we multiply the moduli and add the arguments.
Division:
r1 ejθ1
r2 ejθ2 = r1
r2
e(θ1−θ2)
That is, we divide the moduli and subtract the arguments.
The complex conjugate is of a number r ejθ is the number of same
modulus and negative argument. That is, the complex conjugate of r ejθ
is r e−jθ
Powers:
(r ejθ)n = r ejnθ.
That is, to raise a complex number to the power n, take the nth power of
its modulus and multiply its argument by n.

(4.0123)2 + (2.9142)2 ≈4.959 and

To ﬁnd z1 −z2, we already have found (above) that
z1 = 3 ej(π/6) ≈2.5981 + j1.5 and
z2 = 2 ej(π/4) ≈1.4142 + j1.4142
Therefore
z1 −z2 ≈2.5981 + j1.5 −(1.4142 + j1.4142) = 1.1839 + j0.0858
To express z1 −z2 back in polar form, use r =

x2 + y2 and θ =
tan−1(y/x) (+π if x is negative):
z1 −z2 ≈1.1839 + j0.0858 ≈1.187 ej0.0723.
To ﬁnd z1z2, multiply the moduli and add the arguments
z1z1 = 3 ej(π/6)2ej(π/4) = 3.2 ej((π/6)+(π/4)) = 6 e−j(5π/12).

Expressions for the trigonometric
functions
From the exponential form, we can ﬁnd expressions for the cosine or sine
in terms of complex numbers. We begin with a complex number z of
modulus 1 and its complex conjugate
ejθ = cos(θ) + j sin(θ)
(10.1)
e−jθ = cos(θ) −j sin(θ)
(10.2)
From these, we can ﬁnd the expression for the cosine and sine in terms
of the complex exponential. Adding Equation (10.1) and (10.2), we have
ejθ + e−jθ = cos(θ) + j sin(θ) + cos(θ) −j sin(θ)
⇔
ejθ + e−jθ = 2 cos(θ)
Dividing both sides by 2 gives
1
2(ejθ + e−jθ) = cos(θ)
⇔
cos(θ) = 1
2(ejθ + e−jθ)
TLFeBOOK

228
Complex numbers
Now, subtracting Equation (10.2) from Equation (10.1), we get
ejθ −e−jθ = cos(θ) + j sin(θ) −(cos(θ) −j sin(θ))
⇔
ejθ −e−jθ = 2j sin(θ)
Dividing both sides by 2j gives
1
2j(ejθ −e−jθ) = sin(θ)
⇔
sin(θ) = 1
2j(ejθ −e−jθ)
So, we have
cos(θ) = 1
2(ejθ + e−jθ)
sin(θ) = 1
2j(ejθ −e−jθ)
Using tan(θ) = sin(θ)/ cos(θ), we get
tan(θ) = (1/2j)(ejθ −e−jθ)
(1/2)(ejθ + e−jθ) = 1
j
ejθ −e−jθ
ejθ + e−jθ

Compare these with the deﬁnition of the sinh, cosh, and tanh functions
given in Chapter 8:
cosh(θ) = 1
2(eθ + e−θ)
sinh(θ) = 1
2(eθ −e−θ)
tanh(x) = eθ −e−θ
eθ + e−θ
We see that:
cos( jθ) = cosh(θ)
sin( jθ) = j sinh(θ)
tan( jθ) = j tanh(θ)
De Moivre’s theorem
Usingtheexpressionforthecmoplexnumberintermsofasineandcosine,
rejθ = r(cos(θ) + j sin(θ)), and using this in r ejθn = r ejnθ, we get
(r(cos(θ) + j sin(θ))n = rn(cos(nθ) + j sin(nθ))
This is called De Moivre’s theorem and can be used to obtain multiple
angle formulae.
Example 10.19
Find sin(3θ) in terms of powers of sin(θ) and cos(θ).
TLFeBOOK

Complex numbers
229
Solution
We use the fact that sin(3θ) = Im(cos(3θ)+j sin(3θ)), where
Im( ) represents ‘the imaginary part of’. Hence
sin(3θ) = Im(ej3θ)
= Im((cos(θ) + j sin(θ))3).
Expanding
(cos(θ) + j sin(θ))3 = (cos(θ) + j sin(θ))(cos(θ) + j sin(θ))2
= (cos(θ) + j sin(θ))(cos2(θ) + 2j cos(θ) sin(θ) + j2 sin2(θ))
= cos3(θ) + j sin(θ) cos2(θ) + 2j cos2(θ) sin(θ)
+ j2 cos(θ) sin2(θ) + 2j2 cos(θ) sin2(θ) + j3 sin3(θ)
= cos3(θ) + 3j sin(θ) cos2(θ) −3 cos(θ) sin2(θ) −j sin3(θ)
= cos3(θ) −3 cos(θ) sin2(θ) + j(3 sin(θ) cos2(θ) −sin3(θ)).
As sin(3θ) = Im((cos(θ) + j sin(θ))3), we take the imaginary part of the
expression we have found to get
sin(3θ) = 3 sin(θ) cos2(θ) −sin3(θ).
Example 10.20
Express cos3(θ) in terms of cosines of multiples of θ.
Solution
Usingcos(θ) = (1/2)(ejθ+e−jθ)andtheexpansion(a+b)3 =

The exponential form can be used to solve complex equations of the
form zn = c, where c is a complex number. A particularly important
example is the problem of ﬁnding all the solutions of zn = 1, called the
n roots of unity.
The n roots of unity
To solve the equation zn = 1, we use the fact that 1 is a complex number
with modulus 1 and argument 0, as can be seen in Figure 10.19(a). How-
ever, we can also use an argument of 2π, 4π, 6π, or any other multiple of
2π. As 2π is a complete revolution, adding 2π on to the argument of any
complex number does not change the position of the vector representing
it and therefore does not change the value of the number.
TLFeBOOK

Complex numbers
Figure 10.19
(a) 1 is the complex number ej0, that is, with a modulus of 1 and an argument of 0. (b) 1 can
also be represented using an argument of 2π, that is, 1 = ej2π. (c) 1 represented with an argument of 4π,
that is, 1 = ej4π.
The equation zn = 1 can be expressed as
zn = ej2πN
where N ∈Z
We can solve this equation by taking the nth root of both sides, which is
the same as taking both sides to the power 1/n.
(zn)1/n = ej2πN/n
where N ∈Z
We can substitute some values for N to ﬁnd the various solutions also
using the fact that there should be n roots to the equation zn = 1 so that
we can stop after ﬁnding all n roots.
Figure 10.20
The solutions
to z3 = 1 are z = 1,
z = ej2π/3, and z = ej4π/3.
Notice that one solution can
be obtained from another by
rotation through 2π/3.
Example 10.21
Find all the solutions to z3 = 1.
Solution
Write 1 as a complex number with argument 2πN giving the
equation as
z3 = ej2πN
where N ∈Z.
Taking the cube root of both sides:
(z3)1/3 = ej(2πN/3)
where N ∈Z.
Substituting
N = 0 :
z = ej2π0 = 1
N = 1 :
z = ej2π/3
N = 2 :
z = ej4π/3.
There is no need to use any more values of N. We use the fact that
there should be three roots of a cubic equation. If we continued to sub-
stitute values for N, then the values will begin to repeat. For example,
substituting N = 3 gives z = ej2π3/3 = ej2π, which we know is the same
as ej0 (subtracting 2π from the argument) which equals 1, which is a root
that we have already found.
The solutions to z3
= 1 are shown on an Argand diagram in
Figure 10.20. The principal root of a complex equation is the one found
nearest to the position of the positive x-axis. Notice that in the case of
z3 = 1, the principal root is 1 and the other solutions can be obtained
from another by rotation through 2π/3. Hence, another way of ﬁnding
the n roots of zn = 1 is to start with the principal root of z = 1 = ej0
and add on multiples of 2π/n to the argument, in order to ﬁnd the other
roots.

Example 10.22
Find all the roots of z5 = 1
Solution
One root, the principal root, is z = 1 = ej0. The other roots
can be found by rotating this around the complex plane by multiples of
2π/5. Therefore, we have the solutions:
z = 1, ej2π/5, ej4π/5, ej6π/5, ej8π/5.
These are shown in Figure 10.21.

The solutions
to z5 = 1 are z=1, ej2π/5,
ej4π/5, ej6π/5, and ej8π/5.
Notice that one solution can

Solving some other complex equations
If we have the equation zn = c, where c is any complex number, then we
write the right-hand side of the equation in exponential form and use the
fact that we can add a multiply of 2π to the argument without changing
the value of the number. Write
c = r ejθ = r ej(θ+2πN)
where N ∈Z
zn = r ej(θ+2πN)
⇔z = r(1/n)e(j(θ+2πN)/n)
taking the nth root of both sides.
Figure 10.22
The solutions
to z3 = −4 + j4/3 are
z = 2ej2π/9, 2ej8π/9, and
2ej14π/9. Notice that one
solution can be obtained from
another by rotation through
2π/3.

So, the equation becomes

where N ∈Z
⇔
z = 81/3 ej(2π/3+2πN)/3
⇔
z = 2 ej(2π/3+2πN)/3,
where N ∈Z
Substituting some values for N gives
N = 0 :
z = 2 ej2π/9
N = 1 :
z = 2 ej(2π/9+2π/3) = 2 ej8π/9
N = 2 :
z = 2 ej(2π/9+4π/3) = 2 ej14π/9.
The solutions are

10.9 Summary
1.
Simple systems can be represented by a complex number multiplying
a single frequency input. The output then has the same frequency as
the input, with a modiﬁed amplitude and a shifted phase.
2.
j is the number which when multiplying a phasor has the effect of
rotating the phase by π/2 (or 90◦). j × j rotates the phase by π (180◦),
which is equivalent to multiplication by −1. Hence j2 = −1 and
j =
√
−1. Sometimes i is used instead of j to represent
√
−1.
3.
A complex number is any number that can be represented on the
complex plane. It can be written as z = x + jy (x and y real) where
x is the real part of z (Re(z) = x) and y is the imaginary part of
z (Im(z) = y). A complex number expressed in the form z = x + jy
is said to be in Cartesian or rectangular form.
4.
The complex conjugate of a + jb is a −jb; (a + jb)∗= a −jb.
The product of a number and its complex conjugate is always a real
number greater than or equal to 0: (a + jb)(a + jb)∗= (a + jb)(a −
jb) = a2 + b2, which is real and ⩾0. zz∗= |z|2, where z is
any complex number: a number multiplied by its conjugate gives its
modulus squared.
5.
The operations of addition and subtraction of complex numbers are
like those for vectors: simply add or subtract the real parts and then
the imaginary parts. Multiply as follows, remembering j2 = −1.
(1 + j2)(−3 −j3) = (1)(−3) + j2(−3) + 1(−j3) + (j2)(−j3)
= −3 −j6 −j3 −j26
= −3 −j9 + 6 = 3 −j9
To divide multiply the top and bottom lines by the complex
conjugate of the bottom line as follows:
1 + j2
−3 −j3 = (1 + j2)(−3 + j3)
(−3 −j3)(−3 + j3)
= −3 −j6 + j3 −6
(−3)2 + (3)2

All quadratic equations can now be solved if x ∈C, that is, x is a
complex number. If ax2 +bx +c = 0 where a, b, c are real numbers,
then
x = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
The solutions are real if b2 ⩾4ac. If b2 < 4ac, then the solutions
can be written as x = p ± jq, where
p = −b
2a
and
q =
√
4ac −b2
2a
,
p and q are real
and therefore, non-real roots are complex conjugates of each other.
7.
Complex numbers can be written in polar form r∠θ, where r is the
modulus of the number and θ is the argument. The modulus is the

length of the vector representing the complex number and θ is the
angle made with the positive real axis.

r =

x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ)
To add or subtract complex numbers expressed in polar form, ﬁrst
convert to rectangular form. To multiply, multiply the moduli and
add the arguments and to divide, divide the moduli and subtract the
arguments:
r1∠θ1r2∠θ2 = r1r2∠(θ1 + θ2)

r2∠θ2

Complex numbers are used in the analysis of alternating current (AC)
circuits. ω is the angular frequency of the source. Resistors, capac-
itors, and inductors have associated impedances, Z, where for a
resistor Z = R, for a capacitor Z = 1/jωC, and for an inductor
Z = jωL, where R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, and L is
the inductance. The voltage and the current are related by
V = ZI
and the impedances of circuit elements obey
ZR = Z1 + Z2
for elements in series, and
1
ZR
= 1
Z1
+ 1
Z2
for elements in parallel, where ZR is the resultant impedance. The
admittance Y is the reciprocal of the impedance: Y = 1/Z.
9.
d2y/dt2 = −ω2y is the differential equation that deﬁnes waves
as a function of time. This is an equation of motion where the
acceleration is proportional to the distance from the origin. This
is called simple harmonic motion. By examining the case of circu-
lar motion, at constant angular velocity, where the rotating vector
z = x + jy = r cos(ωt) + jr sin(ωt) obeys this equation, we can
show the equivalence of the polar representation of a complex wave
and the exponential form:
r ejωt = r cos(ωt) + jr sin(ωt) = r∠ωt
as θ = ωt, we have
r ejθ = r cos(θ) + jr sin(θ) = r∠θ
Here, r is the modulus of the complex number and θ is the argument.
TLFeBOOK

234
Complex numbers
Replacing θ by −θ, we get
r e−jθ = r cos(θ) −j sin(θ) = r∠−θ
From these, using the case where r = 1, we can ﬁnd the expression
for the cosine and sine in terms of the complex exponential:
cos(θ) = 1
2(ejθ + e−jθ)
sin(θ) = 1
2j(ejθ −e−jθ)
tan(θ) = 1
j
ejθ −e−jθ
ejθ + e−jθ

and by comparing these with the deﬁnition of the sinh, cosh, and
tanh function we see that:
cos( jθ) = cosh(θ)
sin( jθ) = j sinh(θ)
tan( jθ) = j tanh(θ)
10.

Using the expression for the complex number in terms of a sine and
cosine, r ejθ = r(cos(θ) + j sin(θ)), and using this in the expression
above, we get
(r(cos(θ) + j sin(θ))n = rn(cos(nθ) + j sin(nθ))
The complex conjugate of r ejθ is r e−jθ.
The derivative of a complex exponential is easy to ﬁnd. As

regions where it is increasing or decreasing, and where it has maximum
and minimum values. For instance, we may be interested in ﬁnding the
maximum height, maximum power, or generating the maximum proﬁt, or
in ﬁnding ways to use the minimum amount of energy or minimum use of
materials. Maximum and minimum points can also help in the process of
sketching a function.
11.2 Stationary
points, local
maxima and
minima
Example11.1
Throwastoneintheairandinitiallyitwillhaveapositive
velocity as the height, s, increases; that is, ds/dt > 0. At some point it
will start to fall back to the ground, the distance from the ground is then
decreasing, and the velocity is negative, ds/dt < 0. In order to go from
a positive velocity to a negative velocity there must be a turning point,
where the stone is at its maximum height and the velocity is zero. If the
stone has initial velocity 20 ms−1, how can we ﬁnd the maximum height
that it reaches?
In order to express the velocity of the stone we can make the assumption
that air resistance is negligible and use the relationship between distance
and time for motion under constant acceleration, giving
s = ut + 1
2at2
where s is the distance travelled, u the initial velocity, t is time, and a the
acceleration. In this case, u = 20 ms−1 and a = −g (acceleration due to
gravity ≈10 ms−2), so s = 20t −5t2.
At the maximum height, the rate of change of distance with time
must be 0, that is, the velocity is 0. Therefore, we differentiate to ﬁnd
the velocity:
v = ds
dt = 20 −10t
Putting v = 0 gives
0 = 20 −10t
⇔10t = 20 ⇔t = 2
TLFeBOOK

238
Maxima and minima and sketching functions
We have shown that the maximum height is reached after 2 s. But what
is that height? Substituting t = 2 into the equation for s gives
s = 20(2) −5(2)2 = 20 m
giving the maximum value of s as 20 m.
This example illustrates the important step in ﬁnding maximum and
minimum values of a function, y = f (x). That is, we differentiate and
solve
dy
dx = 0
This may give various values of x. The points where dy/dx = 0 are
called the stationary points but having found these we still need a way
of deciding whether they could be maximum or minimum values. In the
example, we knew that a stone thrown into the air must reach a maximum
height and then return to the ground, and so by solving ds/dt = 0 we
would ﬁnd the time at the maximum. Other problems may not be so clear
cut and thus we need a method of distinguishing between different types
of stationary points.
A stationary point is classiﬁed as either a local maximum, a local
minimum, or a point of inﬂexion. The plural of maximum is maxima
and the plural of minimum is minima. The word ‘local’ is used in the
description, because local maxima or local minima do not necessarily give
the overall maximum or minimum values of the function. For instance,
in Figure 11.1 there is a local maximum at B, but the value of y at x = x1
is actually bigger; hence, the overall maximum value of the function in
the range is given by y at x1.
To see how to classify stationary points, examine Figure 11.1, where
points A, B, and C are all stationary points.
In order to analyse the slope of the function, imagine the function as
representing the cross-section of a mountain range and we are crossing it
from left to right.
At points A, B, and C in Figure 11.1, the gradient of the tangent to the
curve is zero, that is, dy/dx = 0.
At A there is a local minimum, where the graph changes from going
downhill to going uphill.
At B there is a local maximum, where the graph changes from going
uphill to going downhill.

some function y = f (x)

Points A, B, and C in the

They are points where the
gradient of the tangent to the
curve is zero, that is,
dy/dx = 0.

Figure 11.2
(a) The graph
of Figure 11.1. (b) A sketch of
its derivative dy/dx = f ′(x).
Where y = f (x) has a
stationary point, that is, where
the tangent to the curve is ﬂat,
then dy/dx = 0. Where f (x) is
increasing the derivative is
positive and where f (x) is
decreasing the derivative is
negative.
At C there is a point of inﬂexion, where the graph goes ﬂat brieﬂy before
resuming its descent.
Local maxima and minima are also called turning points because the
function is changing from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.
By looking at where the graph is going uphill, that is, dy/dx > 0, at
where it is going downhill, that is, dy/dx < 0, and especially remem-
bering to mark the points where dy/dx = 0, the stationary points, we
can draw a very rough sketch of the derivative of any function just by
looking at its graph. This we do for our example graph in Figure 11.2. By
examining the graph of dy/dx we can see that at a local minimum point
dy/dx = 0 and dy/dx is negative just before the minimum and positive
afterwards. For a local maximum point dy/dx = 0 and dy/dx is positive
just before the maximum and negative afterwards.
If at the point where dy/dx = 0 and the derivative has the same sign
on either side of the stationary point then it must be a point of inﬂexion.
(At point C, dy/dx is negative just before and just after x = c.)
Analysing the sign of dy/dx on either side of a stationary point is
one way of classifying whether it is a maximum, minimum, or point of
inﬂexion. Another, sometimes quicker way, is to use the derivative of the
derivative, the second derivative, d2y/dx2, also referred to as f ′′(x).
To
understand
how
to
use
the
second
derivative,
examine
Figure 11.2(b). We can see that at xa, f ′(x) is heading uphill; hence,
its slope, f ′′(x), is positive. At xb, f ′(x) is heading downhill; hence, its
slope, f ′′(x), is negative. At xc, f ′(x) has zero slope and therefore f ′′(x)
is 0.
We can now summarize the steps involved in ﬁnding and classifying
the stationary points of a function y = f (x) and in ﬁnding the overall
maximum or minimum value of a function.
Step 1
Find the values of x at the stationary points. First, ﬁnd dy/dx
and then solve for x such that dy/dx = 0.
Step 2
To classify the stationary points there is a choice of method,
although Method 2 does not always give a conclusive
result.
Method 1
For each of the values of x found in Step 1, ﬁnd
out whether the derivative is positive or negative
just before the stationary point and just after the

These results are summarized in Figure 11.3.
Method 2
Find the second derivative, d2y/dx2 and substitute
in turn each of the values of x found in Step 1 (the
values of x at the stationary points).
If d2y/dx2 is negative, this indicates that there is a
maximum point.
If d2y/dx2 is positive, this indicates that there is a
minimum point.
However, if d2y/dx2 = 0, then the test is inconclu-
sive and we must revert to Method 1.

maximum point; (b) a
minimum point; (c) two points
of inﬂexion. The sign of the
slope of the curve, given by
dy/dx, are marked on either
side of the stationary point.
Step 3
Find the values of y at the maximum and minimum points to
give the co-ordinates of the turning points.
Step 4
The overall maximum or minimum values of the function can be
found in the following way, as long the function is continuous
over the values of x of interest. Substitute the boundary values
of x into the function to ﬁnd the corresponding values for y.
Compare the values of y found in Step 3 to these boundary values
to ﬁnd the overall maximum and minimum.
Example 11.2
Find and classify the stationary points of y = x3−9x2+
24x+3 and ﬁnd the overall maximum and minimum value of the function
in the range x = 0 to x = 5.
Solution
Step 1. First, we must solve dy/dx = 0
y = x3 −9x2 + 24x + 3 ⇒
dy
dx = 3x2 −18x + 24
So we put
3x2 −18x + 24 = 0
⇔
x2 −6x + 8 = 0
(dividing by 3)
⇔
(x −2)(x −4) = 0
TLFeBOOK

241
(factorizing to ﬁnd the roots, although we could also use the formula for
solving a quadratic equation if no factorization can easily be found)
⇔
x −2 = 0
or
x −4 = 0
⇔
x = 2
or
x = 4
Therefore, the stationary points occur when x = 2 or x = 4.
Step 2. To classify these we use Method 2 as outlined above and look
at the second derivative, that is, we differentiate dy/dx
dy
dx = 3x2 −18x + 24 ⇒
d2y
dx2 = 6x −18
At x = 2, d2y/dx2 = 12 −18 = −6, which is negative, showing that at
x = 2, f ′′(x) is negative and we therefore have a local maximum.
At x = 4, d2y/dx2 = 24 −18 = 6, which is positive, showing that at
x = 4, f ′′(x) is positive and we therefore have a local minimum.
Step 3. We still need to know the function value, the value of y at these
stationary points. To ﬁnd the value of y we substitute into the original
expression. At x = 2, we get
y = (2)3 −9(2)2 + 24(2) + 3 = 8 −36 + 48 + 3 = 23
Therefore, the local maximum occurs at the point (2,23). At x = 4, we get
y = (4)3 −9(4)2 + 24(4) + 3 = 64 −144 + 96 + 3 = 19
Hence, the local minimum occurs at the point (4,19).
Step 4. To ﬁnd the overall maximum value and minimum value,
substitute the boundary values for x. These are given as x = 0 and
x = 5.
At x = 0, y = (0)3 −9(0)2 + 24(0) + 3 = 0 −0 + 0 + 3 = 3
At x = 5, y = (5)3 −9(5)2 + 24(5) + 3 = 125 −225 + 120 + 3 = 23
So the boundary points are (0, 3) and (5, 23).
Comparing the numbers 3 and 23 with the values of the function
at the maximum and minimum in Step 3, that is, 23 and 19, we
can see that the overall maximum value occurs at x = 5 and x =
2, where y = 23. The overall minimum value occurs at x = 0,
where y = 3. These ﬁndings are conﬁrmed by the sketch of the
function, which we now have sufﬁcient information to make, as in
Figure 11.4.

Example 11.3
Find and classify the stationary points of y = −(2−x)4.
Solution
Step 1
y = −(2 −x)4
⇒
dy
dx = 4(2 −x)3
Stationary points occur where dy/dx = 0:
4(2 −x)3 = 0 ⇔x = 2
Step 2. To classify this stationary point, we differentiate again:
d2y
dx2 = −12(2 −x)2
At x = 2, we get d2y/dx2 = −12(2 −2)2 = 0. So the second derivative
is zero.
We cannot use the second derivative test to classify the stationary point
because a zero value is inconclusive, so we go back to the ﬁrst derivative
and examine its sign at a value of x just less than x = 2 and just greater
than x = 2. This can be done with the help of a table. Choose any values
of x less than x = 2 and greater than x = 2, and here we choose x = 1
and x = 3. Be careful if the function is discontinuous at any point not to
cross the discontinuity
x

At x = 1, dy/dx = 4(2 −1)3 = 4 (positive); at x = 3, dy/dx =
4(2−3)3 = −4 (negative). Therefore, near the point x = 2 the derivative
goes from positive to zero to negative. Therefore, the graph of the function
goes from travelling uphill to travelling downhill, showing that we have
a maximum value.
Step 3. Finally, we ﬁnd the value of the function at the maximum point.
At x = 2, y = 0, that is, there is a maximum at (2, 0).

243
Solution
For a maximum value dP/dRL = 0
P =
25RL
(2000 + RL)2
Using the quotient rule to ﬁnd the derivative we get
dP
dRL
= 25(2000 + RL)2 −25RL(2)(2000 + RL)
(2000 + RL)4
⇔
dP
dRL
= (2000 + RL)(50 000 + 25RL −50RL)
(2000 + RL)4
As RL is positive 2000 + RL is non-zero so we can cancel the common
factor of 2000 + RL. Also simplifying the top line gives
dP
dRL
= 50 000 −25RL
(2000 + RL)3
Setting dP /dRL = 0 gives
50 000 −25RL
(2000 + RL)3 = 0
multiplying by (2000 + RL)3, we get
50 000 −25RL = 0
⇔
RL = 2000
We have shown that there is a stationary value of the function P when
RL = 2000 but now we need to check that it is in fact a maximum
value. To do this we substitute values above and below RL = 2000 (say
RL = 1000 and RL = 3000) into dP/dRL:
dP
dRL
= 50 000 −25RL
(2000 + RL)3
when RL = 1000 the top line is positive and the bottom line is positive,
so the sign of dP/dRL is +/+, which is positive. When RL = 3000 the
top line is negative and the bottom line is positive, so the sign of dP/dRL
is −/+, which is negative.
So the derivative of the power with respect to the load resistance goes
from positive to 0 to negative when RL = 2000, indicating a maximum
point.
We have shown that the maximum power to the load occurs when
RL = 2000.
Example 11.5
A rectangular ﬁeld is to be surrounded by a fence of

area?
Solution
The ﬁeld is shown in Figure 11.6. Call the length of the sides
a m and b m. Then the area is given by A = ab.
Figure 11.6
A rectangular
ﬁeld.
The perimeter is given by P = 2a + 2b and as the length of the fence
is 400 m we get:
400 = 2a + 2b ⇔200 = a + b
We wish to ﬁnd the maximum area, and to do this we need to be able
to differentiate A in terms of one of the variables, a or b. We use the
TLFeBOOK

244
Maxima and minima and sketching functions
information given about the length of the perimeter to express a in terms
of b;
a = b −200
and substitute this into the expression for the area, giving
A = b(200 −b) = 200b −b2
To ﬁnd the maximum value for A differentiate with respect to b:
dA
db = 200 −2b
and solve
dA
db = 0 ⇒200 −2b = 0 ⇔
2b = 200 ⇔
b = 100
Check that this is indeed a local maximum value by differentiating a
second time: d2A/db2 = −2, which is negative.
Now we ﬁnd the length of the other side of the ﬁeld
a = 200 −b = 100
Therefore, the ﬁeld with maximum area is a square of side 100. The area
of the ﬁeld is 100 × 100 = 10 000 m2.
To check that this agrees with the original condition that 2a+2b = 400,
substitute a = 100 and b = 100 to get 200+200 = 400, which is correct.
11.3 Graph
sketching by
analysing the
function
behaviour
To sketch the graph of any function y = f (x), we ﬁrst analyse the main
features of the function’s behaviour. Look at the graph in Figure 11.7 and
list the ‘important features’ of the graph. List these in a way that would
enable someone else to sketch the graph from your description.
Figure 11.7
Exercise in
graph sketching.
TLFeBOOK

Maxima and minima and sketching functions
245
Here are some of the important features. The list is not exhaustive but
should be enough to enable someone to reproduce the graph:
1.
The graph is positive for x < −2 and x > 3 and negative for x
between −2 and +3. There are no values of x for which y is zero
and when x = 0, y = −0.167.
2.
The graph is discontinuous at x = −2 and x = 3. y keeps getting
larger as x approaches −2 from the left. A more precise way of
expressing this is to say that as x tends to −2, with x less than −2,
y tends to inﬁnity. The symbol for inﬁnity is ∞and the symbol for
‘tends to’ is →. x tends to −2, with x less than −2 can be expressed
more brieﬂy as x →2−. This gives
as x →−2−, y →∞.
Similarly
as x →−2+, y →−∞.
For the discontinuity at x = 3 we have:
as x →3−,
y
→−∞
as x →3+,
y →∞
3.
There is a local maximum at x = 0.5, where y = −0.16.
4.
For large values of x, y gets nearer to 0. This can be expressed as
as x →∞, y →0+
Similarly:
as x →−∞, y →0+
This list of important features indicates the steps that should be taken
in order to sketch a graph:
Step 1.
Find the value of y when the graph crosses the y-axis; that is,
when x = 0. If possible ﬁnd where the graph crosses the x-axis;
that is, the values of x where y = 0.
Step 2.
Find any discontinuities in the function, that is, are there values
of x where there is no value of y? Inﬁnite discontinuities (a
‘divide by zero’) will lead to vertical asymptotes. These are
vertical lines which the function approaches but does not meet.
We must decide whether the function is positive or negative on
either side of the asymptote.
Step 3.
Find the co-ordinates of the maxima and minima.
Step 4.
Find the behaviour of the function as x tends to plus and minus
inﬁnity.
Step 5.
Mark these features, found from steps 1 to 4 on the graph and
join them, where appropriate, to give the sketch of the graph.

Solution
Step 1. When x = 0:
y =
2.0 + 1
(0 + 1)(0 −5) = 1
−5 = −0.2
When y = 0,
2x + 1
(x + 1)(x −5) = 0
then 2x + 1 = 0 ⇔x = −0.5
Step 2. If the bottom line of the function were 0 this would lead to a
‘divide by zero’ which is undeﬁned. This happens when x + 1 = 0, that
is, x = −1 and when x −5 = 0, that is, x = 5.
These are inﬁnite discontinuities, that is, y will tend to plus or minus
inﬁnity as x approaches these values. The lines at x = −1 and x = 5 are
the asymptotes.
To ﬁnd the sign of y on either side of the asymptotes substitute values
of x on either side of them (avoiding including any values where y = 0).
This can be done using a table, as in Table 11.1.
Using Table 11.1, we can conclude that as y is negative to the left of
the asymptote at x = −1 and positive to the right, then
as x →−1−, y →−∞
as x →−1+, y →+∞
Similarly, as y is negative to the left of the asymptote at x = 5 and positive
to the right of it, then
as x →5−, y →−∞
as x →5+, y →+∞
Step 3. To ﬁnd the turning points look for points where dy/dx = 0
y =
2x + 1
(x + 1)(x −5)
To differentiate, ﬁrst multiply out the brackets on the bottom line of
the expression and then use the formula for ﬁnding the derivative of a
quotient.
y =
2x + 1
(x + 1)(x −5)
⇔y =

dy
dx = −2x2 −2x −6
(x2 −4x −5)2
We now solve dy/dx = 0
−2x2 −2x −6
(x2 −4x −5)2 = 0
⇒−2x2 −2x −6 = 0 ⇒x2 + x + 3 = 0

Because of the square root of a negative number in this expression we
can see that there are no real solutions; here, there are no turning points.
Step 4. When x is large in magnitude then the highest powers of x on
the top and bottom lines of the function expression will dominate. In this
case ignore all the other terms. Considering
y =
2x + 1
(x + 1)(x −5) =
2x + 1
x2 −4x −5
For x large in magnitude
y ∼2x

x
which tends to 0 and is positive as x →∞and tends to 0 and is negative
as x →−∞. We can say that as x →∞, y →0+ and as x →−∞,
y →0−.
Step 5. Sketch the graph. This is done in two stages, as shown in
Figure 11.8.

Sketching the graph of y = (2x + 1)/((x + 1)(x −5)): (a) ﬁrst mark the important points as

Example 11.7
A spring of modulus of elasticity k has a mass, m, sus-
pended from it and is subjected to a oscillating force F = F0 cos(ωt),
where ω > 0. The motion of the mass is damped by the use of a dashpot
of damping constant c. This is displayed in Figure 11.9. After some time
the spring force is found to have oscillations of angular frequency ω and

ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2
Call this function H.
One method to solve this problem would be to consider cases (a), (b),
(c), and (d) separately. However, it is quicker to leave c as an unknown
constant and substitute in for the particular cases later.
Step 1.
H =
1

ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2
when ω = 0, H = 1. The denominator is a positive square root, which
means that H is always ⩾0 where it is deﬁned.
Step 2. Consider any points where H is not deﬁned
H =
1

ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2
As the term inside the square root in the expression for H is a sum of
squares it is always, ⩾0. This means that H is always deﬁned, except
where the denominator is 0. H is not deﬁned when

ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2 = 0
⇒ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2 = 0
ω2c2 + ω4 −2ω2 + 1 = 0
ω4 + ω2(c2 −2) + 1 = 0
By substituting the values of c of interest we see that in case (a) when
c = 2, in case (b) when c = 1/2, and in case (c) when c = 1/4 there
TLFeBOOK

Maxima and minima and sketching functions
249
are no real solutions of this equation for ω. This means that there are no
points where H is undeﬁned. However, for case (d), where c = 0 we get
the equation
ω4 −2ω2 + 1 = 0 ⇔(ω2 −1)2 = 0
ω2 −1 = 0 ⇔ω2 = 1 ⇔ω = 1 or ω = −1
As the frequency of the forcing function is positive then we just have
the one value where H is discontinuous, at ω = 1. For case (d), where
c = 0, H is undeﬁned when ω = 1. This is an inﬁnite ‘divide by zero’
discontinuity. We have already noted that H is always positive where it
is deﬁned and so we know that as ω →1−, H →+∞and as ω →
1+, H →+∞.
Step 3. To ﬁnd the stationary points solve dH/dω = 0
H =


ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2
is easier to differentiate if we use the rules of powers to give
H = (ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2)−1/2
Using the function of a function rule we get
dH
dω = −1
2(ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2)−3/2(2ωc2 + 2(ω2 −1)(2ω))
dH
dω = −2ωc2 + 2(ω2 −1)(2ω)
2(ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2)3/2 = −
2ωc2 + 4ω3 −4ω
2(ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2)3/2
Dividing the top and bottom lines by 2 and rearranging the terms on
the top line gives
dH
dω = −
2ω3 + ω(c2 −2)
(ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2)3/2
Setting dH/dω = 0 gives
−
2ω3 + ω(c2 −2)
(ω2c2 + (ω2 −1)2)3/2 = 0
multiplying both sides by −1 times the denominator of the left-hand side
gives
2ω3 + ω(c2 −2) = 0
⇔
ω(2ω2 + c2 −2) = 0
⇔
ω = 0 ∨2ω2 + c2 −2 = 0
⇔
ω = 0 ∨2ω2 = 2 −c2
⇔
ω = 0 ∨ω2 = (2 −c2)/2
⇔

a real solution if c = 2.

We wait until speciﬁc values of c are substituted in order to analyse the
type of stationary points and the value of H at these points. Also note that
this analysis is not valid for the case c = 0 as this completely changes
the nature of the function H.
Step 4. When ω is large in magnitude
H ∼

ω4
and this tends to 0 for large ω. Therefore, as ω →∞, H →0+.
Step 5. Now we can sketch the graph using the information found and
after substituting the various values of c.
Case (a): c = 2. On substituting c = 2, we have
H =


4ω2 + (ω2 −1)2 .
The graph passes through (0, 1) (Step 1), and the function is deﬁned for
all ω ⩾0 (Step 2). The stationary point is at ω = 0. In this case
dH
dω = −
2ω3 + 2ω
(4ω2 + (ω2 −1)2)3/2 = −
2ω(ω2 + 1)
(4ω2 + (ω2 −1)2)3/2
This is positive for ω < 0 and negative for ω > 0 and therefore there is
a maximum value at ω = 0.
Case (b): c = 1
2. Here
H =


ω2/4 + (ω2 −1)2
The graph passes through (0, 1) (Step 1), and there are no discontinuities
(Step 2). The stationary points are at ω = 0 and ω =

√7/8 ≈0.935 (Step 3):
dH
dω =
−ω(2ω2 −7/4)
(ω2/4 + (ω2 −1)2)3/2
dH/dω < 0 for ω < 0 and dH/dω > 0 for ω > 0; therefore, there is a
minimum value at ω = 0,
dH/dω > 0 for ω just less than √7/8,
dH/dω < 0 for ω just greater than √7/8.
Therefore there is a maximum value of H at ω = √7/8 ≈0.935.

the graphs as in Figure 11.10.
11.4 Summary
1.
To ﬁnd and classify stationary values of a function y = f (x), then
Step 1. ﬁnd dy/dx and solve for x such that dy/dx = 0
Step 2. classify the stationary points.
Method 1. By examining the sign of dy/dx near the point, in
which case + →0 →−indicates a local maximum point,
−→0 →+ indicates a local minimum point, and + →0 →
+ or −→0 →−indicates a point of inﬂexion.
Method 2. By ﬁnding d2y/dx2 at the point.
If d2y/dx2 < 0 then there is a local maximum point
If d2y/dx2 > 0 then there is a local minimum point
However, if d2y/dx2 = 0 then this test is inconclusive and
Method 1 must be used instead.
Substitute the values of x at the stationary points to ﬁnd the relevant
values of y. Local maxima and minima are also called turning points.
2.
If the function, deﬁned for a range of values of x, is continuous, then
the overall maximum and minimum values can be found by ﬁnding
the values of y at the local maxima and minima and the values of y
at the boundary points. The maximum of all of these is the global
maximum and the minimum of all of these is the global minimum
value.

There are many practical problems that involve the need to ﬁnd the
maximum or minimum value of a function.

The stationary values are used when sketching a graph. We also
look for: (a) values where the graph crosses the axes; (b) points of
discontinuity and the behaviour near discontinuities; (c) behaviour
as x tends to ±∞.

Sequences and
series
12.1
Introduction
Sequences have two main applications: serving as a digital representation
of a signal after analog to digital (A/D) conversion or as a method of
solving a numerical problem by getting a sequence of answers, each one
being closer to the exact, correct solution.
The advance of digital communications has resulted from the increased
accuracyinreproductionofthestoredortransmittedsignalindigitalform.
Forinstance, thereproductionofthestoredsignalbyacompactdiscplayer
is far superior to the analog reproduction of the old vinyl records. It is also
very convenient to be able to apply ﬁlters and other processing techniques
in digital form using computers or dedicated microprocessors.
Sequences are often deﬁned in the form of a recurrence relation, special
sorts of which are also called difference equations. Recurrence relations
can be found which will solve certain problems numerically or they may
be derived by modelling the physical processes in a digital system.
The sum of a sequence of terms is called a series. An important example
ofaseriesistheTaylorserieswhichcanbeusedtoapproximateafunction.
Later in the book, we will look at other examples of series such as z
transforms and Fourier series.
Many problems involving sequences and series are solved using a com-
puter. However, it is useful to be able to solve a few simple cases without
the aid of a computer, as this can often help check a result for some special
cases. Some examples of special sequences are the arithmetic progression
and the geometric progression.
12.2 Sequences
and series
deﬁnitions
A sequence is a collection of objects (not necessarily all different)
arranged in a deﬁnite order. Some examples of sequences are:
1.
The numbers 1 to 10, that is, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
2.
Red, Red and Amber, Green, Amber, Red
3.
3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18.
When a sequence follows some ‘obvious’ rule then three dots (. . .) are
used to indicate ‘and so on’, for example, list 1 above may be rewritten as
1, 2, 3, . . . , 10.
The examples so far have all been ﬁnite sequences. Inﬁnite sequences
may use dots at the end, meaning carry on indeﬁnitely in the same fashion,
for example,
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . . .
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . .
4, 9, 16, 25, 36, . . .
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . . .
TLFeBOOK

Sequences and series
255
and the (. . .) indicates that there is no end to the sequence of values and
that they carry on in the same fashion.
The elements of a sequence can be represented using letters, for
example,
a1, a2, a3, a4, . . . , an, . . .
The ﬁrst term is called a1, the second a2 etc. (Sometimes it is more
convenient to say that a sequence begins with a zeroth term, a0).
If a rule exists by which any term in the sequence can be found then this
may be expressed by the ‘general term’ of the sequence, usually called
an or ar. This rule may be expressed in the form of a recurrence relation,
giving an+1 in terms of an, an−1, . . . . In this case, it may be quite difﬁcult
to ﬁnd the explicit function deﬁnition, that is to solve the recurrence
relation. We look at solving recurrence relations in Chapter 14.
A sequence is a function of natural numbers, or integers. The function
expression is given by the general term.
Example 12.1
Find the general term of the sequence of numbers from
1 to 10
Solution
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 has the general term an = n, where
n = 1 to 10.
We can also write this in ‘standard’ function notation as
a(n) = n,
where n = 1 to 10.
Check: To check that the correct general term or function expression
has been found, reproduce a few of the members of the sequence by
substituting values for n in the general term and check that the sequence
found is the same as the given values. Wherever n occurs in the function
expression or general term replace it by a value.
an = n
for n = 1 gives a1 = 1
for n = 2 gives a2 = 2, etc.
Figure 12.1
The ‘square
numbers’.
Example12.2
Findthegeneraltermofthesequence1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, . . .
and also deﬁne the sequence in terms of a recurrence relation.
Solution
Notice that each term in the sequence is a complete square.
The ﬁrst term is 12, the second term 22, etc. We therefore speculate that
the general term is
an = n2,
where n = 1 to ∞.
In function notation this is
a(n) = n2
To deﬁne the sequence in terms of a recurrence relation means that we
must ﬁnd a way of getting to the n + 1th term if we know the nth term.
There is no prescribed way of doing this: we merely have to try out a few
ideas as to how to see a pattern in the sequence. In this case, we can best
see the pattern with the aid of a diagram where we represent the ‘square
numbers’ using a square as in Figure 12.1. Here we can see that to get
from 22 to 32 we need to add a row of two dots and a column of three
dots. To get from 32 to 42 we need to add a row of three dots and a column
of four dots. In general, to get from n2 to (n + 1)2, we need to add a row
of n dots and a column of n + 1 dots.
TLFeBOOK

256
Sequences and series
As n2 is an and (n + 1)2 is an+1, the rule can be expressed as
an+1 = an + n + n + 1
⇔
an+1 = an + 2n + 1.
However, we also need to give the starting value in order to deﬁne the
sequence using a recurrence relation, so we can say that
an+1 = an + 2n + 1,
where a1 = 1.
Check: To check, we substitute a few values into both the explicit deﬁni-
tion and the recurrence relation to see if we correctly reproduce the terms
in the sequence.
Substitute n = 1, n = 2, n = 3, n = 4, and n = 5 into an = n2.
We get 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, correctly reproducing the ﬁrst ﬁve terms of the
sequence.
Substituting n = 1, n = 2, n = 3 and n = 4, into an+1 = an +2n+1,
where a1 = 1 gives the following.
n = 1: a2 = a1 + 2 + 1; as a1 = 1, this gives a2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which
is correct,
n = 2: a3 = a2 + 4 + 1, as a2 = 4, this gives a3 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9, which
is correct,
n = 3: a4 = a3 + 6 + 1, as a3 = 9, this gives a4 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16,
which is correct,
n = 4: a5 = a4 + 8 + 1, as a4 = 16, this gives a5 = 16 + 8 + 1 = 25,
which is correct.
Example 12.3
Find a recurrence relation to deﬁne the Fibonacci
sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . .
Solution
After some trial and error attempts to spot the rule, we should
be able to see that the way to get the next number is to add up the last
two numbers, so the next term after 13, 21 is 13 + 21 = 34 and the next
is 21 + 34 = 55, etc.
The recurrence relation is therefore
an+1 = an + an−1
and because we have two previous values of the sequence used in the
recurrence relation then we also need to give two initial values. So we
deﬁne that a1 = 1 and a2 = 1.
The recurrence relation deﬁnition of the Fibonacci sequence is
an+1 = an + an−1,
where a1 = 1 and a2 = 1.
Check: Substitute a few values for n into the recurrence relation to see if
it correctly reproduces the given values of the sequence
n = 2: a3 = a2 + a1, where a1 = 1 and a2 = 1, so a3 = 1 + 1 = 2,
which is correct,
n = 3: a4 = a3 + a2, where a2 = 1 and a3 = 2, so a4 = 2 + 1 = 3,
which is correct,
n = 4: a5 = a4 + a3, where a4 = 3 and a2 = 1, so a5 = 3 + 2 = 5,
which is correct.
Digital representation of signals
Supposing we would like to give a digital representation of the sine wave
of angular frequency 3: f (t) = sin(3t), then we might choose a(n) =
sin(3n) to give the sequence of values.

ﬁgures or s.f.)
n = 0:
a(0) = sin(0) = 0
n = 1:
a(1) = sin(3) = 0.14
n = 2:
a(2) = sin(6) = −0.27
n = 3:
a(3) = sin(9) = 0.41
This sequence is shown on a graph in Figure 12.2.
This graph does not look like the sine wave it is supposed to represent.
This is due to ‘undersampling’. a(n) = sin(3n) is the function f (t) =
sin(3t) sampled at a sampling rate of 1, which is very inadequate to see a
good representation. Digital signals are usually expressed in terms of the
sampling interval T so that a suitable sampling interval can be chosen.
For the function f (t) = sin(3t), this gives the sequence
a(n) = sin(3T n)
where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .
The original variable, usually time, t, can be given by t = T n. Choosing
T = 0.1, for instance, gives
a(n) = sin(3 × 0.1n) = sin(0.3n)
where t = nT = 0.1n.
Substituting a few values for n gives
n = 0:
a(0) = 0, t = 0
n = 1:
a(1) = 0.3, t = 0.1
n = 2:
a(2) = 0.56, t = 0.2
n = 3:
a(3) = 0.78, t = 0.3
n = 4:
a(4) = 0.93, t = 0.4
n = 5:
a(5) = 1, t = 0.5
n = 6:
a(6) = 0.97, t = 0.6.
The values are plotted against t in Figure 12.3.
We can see that the picture in Figure 12.3 is a reasonable representation
of the function. The digital representation of f (t) = sin(3t) is therefore
f (nT ) = sin(3nT ), where n is an integer.
The problem of undersampling, which we saw in Figure 12.2 leads
to a phenomenon called aliasing. Instead of looking like line sin(3t),
Figure 12.2 looks like a sine wave of much lower frequency. This same
phenomenon is the one that makes car wheels, pictured on the television,
apparently rotate backwards and at the wrong frequency. The television
TLFeBOOK

Sequences and series
picture is scanned 30 times per second whereas the wheel on the car is
probably revolving in excess of 30 times per second. The sample rate is
insufﬁcient to give a good representation of the movement of the wheel.
The sampling theorem states that the sampling interval must be less than
T = 1/(2f ) seconds in order to be able to represent a frequency of
f hertz.
Example 12.4
Represent the function y = 4 cos(10πt) as a sequence
using a sampling interval of T = 0.01. What is the maximum sampling
interval that could be used to represent this signal?
Solution
The digital representation of y = 4 cos(10πt) is given by
y(0.01n) = 4 cos(0.1πn).
Substituting some values for n gives (to 3 s.f.)
n 0 1

y 1 0.951 0.809 0.588 0.309 0 −0.309 −0.588 −0.809 −0.951 −1
The maximum sampling interval that could be used is 1/(2f ) where f ,
the frequency in this case, is 5, giving T = 1/(2 × 5) = 0.1.
Example 12.5
A triangular wave of period 2 is given by the function
f (t) = t
0 ⩽t < 1
f (t) = 2 −t
1 ⩽t < 2.
Draw a graph of the function and give a sequence of values for t ⩾0
at a sampling interval of 0.1.
Solution
To draw the continuous function, use the deﬁnition y = t
between t = 0 and 1 and draw the function y = 2−t in the region where
t lies between 1 and 2. The function is of period 2 so that section of the
graph is repeated between t = 2 and 4, t = 4 and 6, etc.
The sequence of values found by using a sampling interval of 0.1 is
given by substituting t = T n = 0.1n into the function deﬁnition, giving
a(n) = 0.1n
0 ⩽0.1n < 1 (for n between 0 and 10)
a(n) = 2 −0.1n
1 ⩽0.1n < 2 (for n between 10 and 20).
The sequence then repeats periodically.
This gives the sequence:
0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4,
0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2, . . .
The continuous function is plotted in Figure 12.4(a) and the digital
function in Figure 12.4(b).

Sequences and series
259
Series
A series is the sum of a sequence of numbers or of functions. If the series
contains a ﬁnite number of terms then it is a ﬁnite series otherwise it is
inﬁnite. For example,
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 10
is a ﬁnite series, while
1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + · · · + 1/2n + · · ·
is an inﬁnite series.
To represent series, we may use the sigma notation .
n=10

n=0
1
2n
means ‘sum all the terms 1/2n for n from 0 to 10’.
Example 12.6
Express the following series in sigma notation
−1 + 4 −9 + 16 + · · · + 256.
Solution
To write in sigma notation, we need to ﬁrst express the general
term in the sequence. We notice here that the pattern is that each term is
a complete square with every other term multiplied by −1. The general
term is, therefore
(−1)nn2.
The (−1)n part of this will just cause the sign of the term to be negative
or positive depending on whether n is odd or even.
We can now write
−1 + 4 −9 + 16 + · · · + 256 =
n=16

n=1
(−1)nn2.
The limits of the summation are found by considering the value of n
to use for the ﬁrst and last terms. Check that the expression is correct by
substituting a few values for n which should recover terms in the original
series.
We now look at two commonly encountered types of sequences and
series, the arithmetic and geometric progression.
12.3 Arithmetic
progression
An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence where each term is found by
adding a ﬁxed amount on to the previous term. This ﬁxed amount is called
the common difference. Some examples of arithmetic progressions are:
1.
−1, 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, . . .
Notice that successive terms can be found by adding 4 to the previous
term
−1 + 4 = 3
3 + 4 = 7
7 + 4 = 11
...
TLFeBOOK

260
Sequences and series
showing that the common difference is 4.
2.
25, 15, 5, −5, −15, . . .
Notice that successive terms can be found by adding −10 to the previous
term
25 −10 = 15
15 −10 = 5
5 −10 = −5
−5 −10 = −15
showing that the common difference is −10.
It is not difﬁcult to obtain the recurrence relation for the arithmetic
progression. If we call the common difference d, then the (n + 1)th term
can be found by the previous term, the nth, by adding on d, that is
an+1 = an + d.
This can also be expressed using the difference operator,  (the Greek
capital letter delta) so that an = d, where an = an+1 −an.
If the ﬁrst term is a and the common difference is d then the sequence is
a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d, a + 5d, a + 6d, . . .
The second term is a +d, the fourth is a +3d, the seventh term is a +6d
and the general term
an = a + (n −1)d.
Example 12.7
The seventh term of an AP is 11 and the sixteenth term
is 29. Find the common difference, the ﬁrst term of the sequence, and the
nth term.
Solution
If the ﬁrst term of the sequence is a and the common difference
is d, then the seventh term is given by
an = a + (n −1)d
with n = 7
so
a + 6d = 11.
(12.1)
Similarly, the sixteenth term is a + 15d and as we are given that this is
29, we have
a + 15d = 29.
(12.2)
Subtracting Equation (12.1) from Equation (12.2) gives 9d = 18 ⇔
d = 2, and substituting this into Equation (12.1) gives
a + 6 × 2 = 11
⇔
a = 11 −12 ⇔a = −1.
That is, the ﬁrst term is −1 and the common difference is 2. Hence, the
nth term is a + (n −1)d = −1 + (n −1)2 = −1 + 2n −2 giving,
an = 2n −3.
TLFeBOOK

Sequences and series
261
Check: To check that the general term is correct for this sequence sub-
stitute n = 7 giving a7 = 2(7) −3 = 14 −3 = 11; substitute n = 16
giving a16 = 2(16) −3 = 29, which are the values given in the problem.
The sum of n terms of an
arithmetic progression
There are some simple formulae which can be used to ﬁnd the sum of the
ﬁrst n terms of an AP. These can be found by writing out all the terms of
a general AP from the ﬁrst term to the last term, ℓ, and then adding on
the same series again but this time reversing it. We will begin by ﬁnding
the sum of 20 terms of an AP with ﬁrst term 1 and common difference 3,
giving the general term as 1 + (n −1) × 3 and the last term as 1 + 19 × 3
S20 = 1 + (1 + 3) + (1 + 2 × 3) + · · · + (1 + 18 × 3) + (1 + 19 × 3)
on reversing, we have
S20 = (1+19×3)+(1+18×3)+(1+17×3)+· · ·+(1+1×3)+1
on adding we have 2S20 = (2 + 19 × 3) + (2 + 19 × 3) + (2 + 19 × 3) +
· · · + (2 + 19 × 3) + (2 + 19 × 3).
Notice that each term in the last line is the same, and is equal to the
sum of the ﬁrst term (1) and the last term (1 + 19 × 3) giving 2 + 19 × 3.
As there are 20 terms, we have
2S20 = 20 × (2 + 19 × 3)
S20 = 10 × (2 + 19 × 3) = 590.
It would obviously be simpler to be able to use a formula to calculate
this rather than having to repeat this process for every AP. Therefore,
we go through the same process for an AP of ﬁrst term a and common
difference d with last term l.
The sum of the ﬁrst n terms of an AP is given by:-
Sn = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + · · · + (a + (n −2)d)
+ (a + (n −1)d)
Sn = (a + (n −1)d) + (a + (n −2)d) + (a + (n −3)d)
+ · · · + (a + d) + a
2Sn = (2a + (n −1)d) + (2a + (n −1)d) + (2a + (n −1)d)
+ · · · + (2a + (n −1)d) + (2a + (n −1)d).
Using the fact that there are n terms, we have
2Sn = n(2a + (n −1)d)
Sn = n
2(2a + (n −1)d)
which gives the ﬁrst of two formulae that can be used to ﬁnd the sum of
n terms of an AP.
An alternative formula is found by noticing that the sum is the given by
the number of terms multiplied by the average term. The average term is
half the sum of the ﬁrst term and the last term: average term = (a + l)/2.
This gives the sum of n terms as
Sn = n
2(a + l).

This is the second of the two formulae that may be used to ﬁnd the sum

Sn = 12

12.4 Geometric
progression
A geometric progression (GP) is a sequence where each term is found
by multiplying the previous term by a ﬁxed number. This ﬁxed number
is called the common ratio, r. We have already come across examples
of geometric progressions in Chapter 8, where we looked at exponential
growth. There we had the example of e1 deposited in a bank with a real
rate of growth of 3% so we get the sequence 1, 1.03, 1.09, 1.13, 1.16,
1.19, . . . (expressed to the nearest cent) where each year the amount in
the bank is multiplied by 1.03.
Some more examples of GPs are
1.
16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, . . .
Notice that successive terms can be found by multiplying the previous
term by 0.5:
16 × 0.5 = 8
8 × 0.5 = 4
4 × 0.5 = 2
...
TLFeBOOK

Sequences and series
263
showing that the common ratio is 0.5.
2.
1, 3, 9, 27, 81, . . .
Notice that successive terms can be found by multiplying the previous
term by 3:
1 × 3 = 3
3 × 3 = 9
9 × 3 = 27
...
showing that the common ratio is 3.
3.
−1, 2, −4, 8, −16, . . .
Notice that successive terms can be found by multiplying the previous
term by −2:
(−1) × (−2) = 2
2 × (−2) = −4
(−4) × (−2) = 8
...
showing that the common ratio is −2.
It is not difﬁcult to obtain the recurrence relation for the geometric
progression. If we call the common ratio r then the (n + 1)th term can
be found by the previous term, the nth, by multiplying by r, that is
an+1 = ran.
This can also be expressed using the difference operator, , so that
an = (r −1)an, where an = an+1 −an. If a GP has ﬁrst term, a, and
common ratio, r, then the sequence is
a, ar, ar2, ar2, ar4, . . . , arn−1, . . .
The second term is ar, the fourth term is ar3 and the seventh term is ar6;
the general term is given by
an = arn−1
Example 12.10
Find the general term of the GP
16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, . . .
Solution
This GP has ﬁrst term 16. The common ratio is found by taking
the ratio of any two successive terms. Take the ratio of the ﬁrst two terms
(second term divided by the ﬁrst term) to give
r = 8/16 = 0.5
The general term is given by arn−1 = 16(0.5)n−1.
Example 12.11
A GP has third term 12 and ﬁfth term 48. Find the ﬁrst
term and the common ratio.
TLFeBOOK

264
Sequences and series
Solution
Call the ﬁrst term a and the common ratio r. We know that the
nth term is given by an = arn−1. The fact that the third term is 12 gives
the equation
ar2 = 12
(12.3)
and the fact that the ﬁfth term is 48 gives the equation
ar4 = 48.
(12.4)
Dividing Equation (12.4) by Equation (12.3) gives
r2 = 4.
This means that there are two possible values for the common ratio: either
2 or −2. To ﬁnd the ﬁrst term, substitute for r into Equation (18.3), to get
ar2 = 12 and r = ±2 ⇒4a = 12 ⇔a = 3
So the ﬁrst term is 3.
The sum of a geometric progression
Consider the sum of the ﬁrst six terms of the GP with ﬁrst term 2 and
common ratio 4. To try to ﬁnd the sum we ﬁrst write out the original
series and then multiply the whole series by the common ratio, as this
will reproduce the same terms in the series, only shifted up one place. We
can then subtract the two expressions:
S6 = 2 + 8 + 32 + 128 + 512 + 2048
4S6 =
8 + 32 + 128 + 512 + 2048 + 9192
S6 −4S6 = 2
−9192
So
S6 = 2 −9192
1 −4
as 9192 = 2 × 46, this gives the sum of the ﬁrst six terms as
S6 = 2(1 −46)
1 −4
.
Applying this process to a general GP gives a formula for the sum
of the ﬁrst n terms. Consider the sum, Sn, of the ﬁrst n terms of a GP
whose ﬁrst term is a and whose common ratio is r. Multiply this by r and
subtract.
Sn = a + ar + ar2 + · · · + arn−2 + arn−1
rSn =
ar + ar2 + · · · + arn−2 + arn−1 + arn
Sn −rSn = a
−arn.
This gives
Sn(1 −r) = a −arn = a(1 −rn)
⇔
Sn = a(1 −rn)
1 −r
.
If r > 1, it may be more convenient to write
Sn = a(rn −1)
r −1
.

Example 12.12
The second term of a GP is 2, and the ﬁfth term is
0.03125. Find the ﬁrst term, the common ratio, and the sum of the ﬁrst
10 terms.
Solution
Let the ﬁrst term be a and the common ratio r, then the nth
term is arn+1. The second term is 2 giving the equation
ar = 2.
(12.5)
The ﬁfth term is 0.03125 giving the equation
ar4 = 0.03125.
(12.6)
Dividing Equation (12.6) by Equation (12.5) gives
ar4
ar = 0.03125
2
⇔r3 = 0.015625 ⇔r = (0.015625)1/3 ⇔r = 0.25.
Substituting this value for r into Equaton (21.5) gives
a(0.25) = 2 ⇔a = 2/0.25 ⇔a = 8.
Therefore, the ﬁrst term is 8 and the common ratio is 0.25.
The sum of the ﬁrst n terms is given by
Sn = a(1 −rn)
1 −r
.
Substituting a = 8, r = 0.25, and n = 10 gives
S10 = a(1 −(0.25)10)
1 −0.25
= 13.33 to 4 s.f.
Example 12.13
The general term of a series is given by
an = 2n+1
3n .
Show that the terms of the series form a GP and ﬁnd the sum of the ﬁrst
n terms.
Solution
To show that this is a GP, we must show that consecutive terms
have a common ratio. Take two terms, the mth term and the (m + 1)th
term. The mth term is
2m+1
3m
= am
and the (m + 1)th term is found by substituting n = m + 1 into the
expression for the general term, which gives
am+1 = 2(m+1)+1
3(m+1)
= 2m+2
3m+1 .
We can now spot that am+1 = 2
3am, meaning that the (m + 1)th term is
found by multiplying the mth term by 2
3.
Alternatively, we could divide the (m + 1)th term by the mth term
am+1
am
= 2m+2/3m+1
2m+1/3m
= 2m+2
3m+1 ×
3m
2m+1 = 2
3
giving the common ratio as 2
3.
To ﬁnd the sum of n terms, we need to know the ﬁrst term. To ﬁnd
this, substitute n = 1 into 2n+1/3n, giving 22/3 = 4
3. Thus, the sum of n
terms is given by:

and the sum of n terms is 4(1 −(2/3)n).
We can write out this sum for various values of n to 7 s.f. as in
Table 12.1.
After 40 terms, the sum has become 4 to 7 s.f. and however many more
terms are considered the sum is found to be 4 to 7 s.f. This shows that the
limit of the sum is 4 to 7 s.f. The limit of the sum of n terms as n tends
to inﬁnity is called the sum to inﬁnity.
We can see that the limit is exactly 4 in this case by looking what
happens to 4(1 −(2/3)n) as n tends to inﬁnity.
4(1 −(2/3)n) = 4 −4(2/3)n.
The second term becomes smaller and smaller as n gets bigger and
bigger, and we can see that (2/3)n →0 as n →∞, therefore
S∞= lim

n→∞(4 −4(2/3)n) = 4.

Note that in the case of a GP with common ratio |r| ⩾1, the series sum
will not tend to a ﬁnite limit. For instance, the sum of the GP
2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + · · · + 2n
gets much larger each time a new term is added. We say that the sum of
this series tends to inﬁnity.
12.5 Pascal’s
triangle and the
binomial series
Expressions like (3 + 2y)5 are called binomial expressions. Expanding
these expressions can be very tedious as we need to multiply out (3+2y)
(3+2y)(3+2y)(3+2y)(3+2y) term by term. To speed up this process,
we analyse the coefﬁcients of the terms in the expansion and ﬁnd that
they make a triangular pattern, called Pascal’s triangle.

Pascal’s triangle
Consider a simpler case of (1+x)5. To work this out, we would ﬁrst start
with (1 + x) and multiply by (1 + x) to get (1 + x)2. We then multiply
(1 + x)2 by (1 + x) to get (1 + x)3, etc. continuing this process gives the
following
1 + x
(1)
1 + 2x + x2
(2)
1 + 3x + 3x2 + x3
(3)
1 + 4x + 6x2 + 4x3 + x4
(4)
1 + 5x + 10x2 + 10x3 + 5x4 + x5

If we write out the coefﬁcients of each line of this in a triangular form,
we get

Notice that each line can be found from the line above by adding pairs
of numbers, where the outer numbers are always 1. That is, looking at line
5, the ﬁrst number is 1, the others are found by adding the two numbers
above, 5 = 1 + 4, 10 = 4 + 6, 10 = 6 + 4, 5 = 4 + 1, and the last
number is 1.
Example 12.17
Expand (1 + x)7 in powers of x.

(7)
Now write out the expansion with the powers of x, giving
1 + 7x + 21x2 + 35x3 + 35x4 + 21x5 + 7x6 + x7.
As we can now easily ﬁnd expansions of the form (1+x)n, we now move
on to the more difﬁcult problem of expressions such as (1 + 2y)5. We
can ﬁnd this by substituting x = 2y into the expression for (1 + x)5
(1 + 2y)5 = 1 + 5(2y) + 10(2y)2 + 10(2y)3 + 5(2y)4 + (2y)5.
Remembering to take the powers of 2 as well as y this gives
(1 + 2y)5 = 1 + 10y + 40y2 + 80y3 + 80y4 + 32y5.

Finally, we look at (3 + 2y)5, and to do this we need to be able to
expand expressions like (a + b)5. To ﬁnd (a + b)5, start by dividing
inside the bracket by a to give
(a + b)5 = a5

Noticethepatternonthepowersofa andb. Thepowersofa aredecreasing
term by term as the powers of b are increasing. Always, the sum of the
power of a and power of b is 5.
We can now expand (3 + 2x)5 by using
(a + b)5 = a5 + 5a4b + 10a3b2 + 10a2b3 + 5ab4 + b5
and substitute a = 3 and b = 2x, giving
(3 + 2x)5 = (3)5 + 5(3)4(2x) + 10(3)3(2x)2
+ 10(3)2(2x)3 + 5(3)(2x)4 + (2x)5
= 243 + 810x + 1080x2 + 720x3 + 240x4 + 32x5.

Now, substitute a = 2x and b = −y
(2x −y)6 = (2x)6 + 6(2x)5(−y) + 15(2x)4(−y)2 + 20(2x)3(−y)3

sin(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + a4x4 + a5x5 + · · ·
+ anxn + · · ·
(12.7)
For x = 0, we know that sin(0) = 0, hence substituting x = 0 in
Equation (12.7) we ﬁnd
0 = a0.
To ﬁnd a1, we differentiate both sides of Equation (12.7) to give
cos(x) = a1 + 2a2x + 3a3x2 + 4a4x3 + 5a5x4 + · · ·
+ nanxn−1 + · · ·
(12.8)
Substititute x = 0 and as cos(0) = 1, this gives:
1 = a1.
Differentiating Equation (12.8) we get:
−sin(x) = 2a2 + 3.2a3x1 + 4.3a4x2 + 5.4a5x3 + · · ·
+ n(n −1)anxn−2 + · · ·
(12.9)
Therefore, at x = 0
0 = 2a2
⇔
a2 = 0.

−cos(x) = 3.2.1a3 + 4.3.2a4x + · · ·
+ n(n −1)(n −2)anxn−3 + · · ·
(12.10)
Substituting x = 0 gives:

This is a power series for sin(x) which we have found by expanding
around x = 0.
When we expand around x = 0, we ﬁnd a special case of the Taylor
series expansion called a Maclaurin series.

radius R, that is, for −R < x < R (or |x| < R) and if all its derivatives

Notice that this is a power series with coefﬁcient sequence:

where f (n)(0) is found by ﬁnding the nth derivative of f (x) with respect
to x and then substituting x = 0.
Example 12.24
Find the Maclaurin series for f (x) = ex and give the
range of values of x for which the series is valid.
Solution
Find all order derivatives of f (x) and substitute x = 0
f (x) = ex, f ′(x) = ex, f ′′(x) = ex, f ′′′(x) = ex, f (iv)(x) = ex
f (0) = e0 = 1, f ′(0) = 1, f ′′(0) = 1, f ′′′(0) = 1, f (iv)(0) = 1.
Substituting into Equation (12.11), the Maclaurin series is
ex = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + x4
4! + · · · + xn

As ex exists for all values of x, we can use this series for all values of x.

Solution
Find all order derivatives of sinh(x) and substitute x = 0 in

etc.
f (0) = sinh(0) = 0, f ′(0) = 1, f ′′(0) = 0, f ′′′(0) = 1, f (iv)(0) = 0
Then
sinh(x) = x + x3

The binomial theorem revisited
The binomial theorem, as stated in the previous section, was only given
for n as a whole positive number. We can now ﬁnd the binomial expansion
for (1 + x)n for all values of n using the Maclaurin series.
f (x) = (1 + x)n.
Then
f ′(x) = n(1 + x)n−1
f ′′(x) = n(n −1)(1 + x)n−2
f ′′′(x) = n(n −1)(n −2)(1 + x)n−3.
Substituting x = 0, we get
f (0) = 1,
f ′(0) = n,
f ′′(0) = n(n−1),
f ′′′(0) = n(n−1)(n−2).
Therefore, using Equation (12.11) for the Maclaurin series, we ﬁnd:
(1 + x)n = 1 + nx + n(n −1)
2!
x2 + n(n −1)(n −2)
3!
x3 · · ·
Notice that n can take fractional or negative values, but if n is negative,
|x| < 1 (as found in Example 12.26). For many fractional values of n we
also need to keep to the restriction |x| < 1.

1.06 =
√
1 + 0.06 = (1 + 0.06)1/2
When doing this it is important that the second term, in this case 0.06,
should be a small number so that its higher powers will tend towards zero.
We can now use the binomial expansion, taking terms up to x3,
as we estimate that terms beyond that will be very small. Using

Taylor series
Maclaurin’s series is just a special case of Taylor series. A Taylor series
is a series expansion of a function not necessarily taken around x = 0.
This is given by:
If a function f (x) is deﬁned for values of x around x = a, within some
radius R, that is, for a −R < x < a + R (or |x −a| < R) and if all its
derivatives are deﬁned, then:

we must convert the angles to radians in order to use the Taylor series:

L’Hopital’s rule
When sketching graphs of functions in Chapter 11, we looked at graphs
wherethefunctionisundeﬁnedforsomevaluesofx. Thefunctionf (x) =
1/x, for instance, is not deﬁned when x = 0 and tends to −∞as x →0−
and tends to +∞as x →0+. Not all functions that have undeﬁned
points tend to ±∞near the point where they are undeﬁned. For example,
consider the function f (x) = sin(x)/x. The graph of this function is
shown in Figure 12.5. The function is not deﬁned for x = 0, which we
can see by substituting x = 0 into the function expression. This gives
a zero in the denominator and hence an attempt to divide by 0 which is
undeﬁned. However, we can see from the graph that the function, rather
than tending to plus or minus inﬁnity as x →0, just tends to 1. This
is very useful because we are able to ‘patch’ the function by giving it a
value at x = 0 and the new function is deﬁned for all values of x.
We can deﬁne a new function. This particular function is quite famous,
and is called the sinc function
sinc(x) =



sin(x)
x
where x ̸= 0
1
where x = 0
The points where functions may tend to a ﬁnite limit can be identiﬁed
by looking out for points which lead to 0/0. These are called indeterminate
points, indicating that they are a special type of undeﬁned point.

We can examine what happens to the function near the indetermi-
nate point by using the power series expansions of the denominator and

The last expression is deﬁned at x = 0, so we can substitute x = 0
in order to ﬁnd the limit. This gives the value 1. L’Hopital’s rule is a
quick way of ﬁnding this limit without needing to write out the series
speciﬁcally.
L’Hopital’s rule states that if a function f (x) = g(x)/h(x) is indeter-
minate at x = a then:
lim
x→a
g(x)
h(x) = lim
x→a
g′(x)
h′(x).
If g′(x)/h′(x) is deﬁned at x = a, we can then use
lim
x→a
g′(x)
h′(x) = g′(a)
h′(a)
and if g′(x)/h′(x) is indeterminate at x = a, we can use the rule again.
We can show this to be true by using Equation (12.13) for the Taylor
series expansion about a:
g(x)
h(x) = g(a) + g′(a)(x −a) + (g′′(a)/2!)(x −a)2 + · · ·
h(a) + h′(a)(x −a) + (h′′(a)/2!)(x −a)2 + · · ·
and given that g(a) = 0 and h(a) = 0

h(x) = lim

Substituting x = 1 into

Solution
Substituting x = 0 into

differentiate the top and bottom lines:
lim

cos(x) −1
x2
= lim
x→0
−sin(x)
2x
.
We ﬁnd that the new expression is also indeterminate at x = 0, so we use
L’Hopital’s rule again:
lim
x→0
−sin(x)
2x
= lim
x→0
−cos(x)

The last expression is deﬁned at x = 0 so we can substitute x = 0 to
give

Hence,

12.7 Limits and
convergence
We have already brieﬂy mentioned ideas of limits in various contexts.
We will now look at the idea in more detail. When we looked at the
sum to inﬁnity of a geometric progression in Table 12.1 we looked
at Sn = 4(1 −(2/3)n) as n was made larger and discovered that
S40 = 4 to 7 s.f. and all values of n > 40 also gave Sn = 4 to 7
s.f. This can give us an idea of how to ﬁnd out if a sequence tends to
a limit:
1.
Choose a number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures
2.
Write all terms in the sequence to that number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
3.
The sequence tends to a limit if the terms in the sequence, when
expressed to the agreed number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures, become
constant, that is, do not change after some value of n.
Theoretically, this procedure must work for all possible numbers of
signiﬁcant ﬁgures. As my calculator only displays 8 s.f. I cannot go
through this process for more than 7 s.f. A computer using double preci-
sion arithmetic could perform the calculations to far more (usually up to
18 s.f.).
Consider the series
1 + z + z2 + z3 + · · ·
which is a GP with ﬁrst term 1 and common ratio z, the sum to n terms
gives
1 −zn
1 −z .
For z = 1/2 this gives the series
1 + 1

n
.
We can write, Sn, as a sequence of values to 3 s.f., 5 s.f., and 7 s.f. as is
done in Table 12.2.
From these results we can see that the limit appears to be 2. The
limit is reached to 3 s.f for n = 9, to 5 s.f for n = 15, and to 7 s.f
for n = 22.
The more terms taken in a sequence which converges, then the nearer
we will get to the limit. However we can only get as near as the number
of signiﬁcant ﬁgures, usually limited by the calculator, permits. When
using a numerical method to solve a problem we use these ideas about
convergence.

Newton–
Raphson
method for
solving
equations
Although we already know how to solve linear equations and quadratic
equations other equations may need to be solved by using a numerical
method. One such method is the Newton–Raphson method. The method
consists of an algorithm which can be expressed as follows:
Step 1:
take an equation and write it in the form f (x) = 0, then,
Step 2:
take a guess at a solution
Step 3:
calculate a new value for x using
x ←x −f (x)
f ′(x)
Step 4:
Repeat Step 3 until come convergence criterion has been sat-
isﬁed or until it is decided that the method has failed to ﬁnd a
solution. Here, the ‘←’ symbol has been used to represent the
‘assignment operator’.
x ←x −f (x)
f ′(x)
means replace x by a value found by taking the old value of x and calcu-
lating x −f (x)/f ′(x). We will return to the problems in Steps 1 and 4
later; ﬁrst we will look at a simple example of using the Newton–Raphson
method.
Example 12.34

√
5 correct
to 7 s.f.
TLFeBOOK

284
Sequences and series
Solution
√
5 is one solution to the equation x2 = 5
Step 1: Write the equation in the form f (x) = 0
x2 = 5
⇔
x2 −5 = 0
Step 2: Take a guess at the solution. We know that
√
5 is slightly bigger
than
√
4 so take a ﬁrst guess as x = 2.
Steps 3 and 4: Calculate
x ←x −f (x)
f ′(x)
until some convergence criterion is satisﬁed.
As f (x) = x2 −5, f ′(x) = 2x
x ←x −f (x)
f ′(x)
gives
x ←x −x2 −5
2x
.
This can be written over a common denominator, giving
x ←x2 + 5
2x
which is the Newton–Raphson formula for solving x2 −5 = 0.
Start with x = 2
x ←4 + 5
4
x = 2.25
Substitute x = 2.25
x ←(2.25)2 + 5
2(2.25)
x = 2.2361111
Substitute x = 2.2361111
x ←(2.2361111)2 + 5
2(2.2361111)
x = 2.236068
Substitute x = 2.236068
x ←(2.236068)2 + 5
2(2.236068)
x = 2.236068
We notice that in the last iteration there has been no change in the value
of x, so we assume that the algorithm has converged, giving
√
5 = 2.236068 to 7 s.f.
The sequence of values we have found is:
2, 2.25, 2.2361111, 2.236068, 2.236068, and we need to stop at this
point because the value of x has not changed in the last iteration.

Example 12.35
Find a solution to the equation x3 −3x2 + 2x + 1 = 0
Solution
Step 1: The equation is already expressed in the correct form.
Step 2: We need to ﬁnd a ﬁrst guess for the solution and to do this
we could sketch the graph to see roughly where it crosses the x-axis or
we could try substituting a few values into the function f (x) = x3 −
3x2 + 2x + 1 and look for a change of sign, which we have done in
Table 12.3. As the function is continuous, the function must pass through
zero in order to change from positive to negative, or vice versa. There is
a change of sign between x = −0.5 and x = 0, so we take as a ﬁrst guess
a point half way between these two values, giving x = −0.25.
Step 3: Using the Newton–Raphson formula
x ←x −f (x)
f ′(x)
and substituting f (x) = x3 −3x2 + 2x + 1 gives
x ←x −x3 −3x2 + 2x + 1
3x2 −6x + 2
and simplifying gives
x ←2x3 −3x2 −1
3x2 −6x + 2 .
Starting by substituting x = −0.25 gives
x ←2(−0.25)3 −3(−0.25)2 −1
3(−0.25)2 −6(−0.25) + 2 = −1.21875
3.6875
= −0.3305084
Now substitute x = −0.3305084 giving
x ←2(−0.3305084)3 −3(−0.3305084)2 −1
3(−0.3305084)2 −6(−0.3305084) + 2 = −0.3247489.
Substitute x = −0.3247489 giving
x ←2(−0.3247489)3 −3(−0.3247489)2 −1
3(−0.3247489)2 −6(−0.3247489) + 2 = −0.3247179.
Substitute x = −0.3247179 giving
x ←2(−0.3247179)3 −3(−0.3247179)2 −1
3(−0.3247179)2 −6(−0.3247179) + 2 = −0.3247179.
As the last two numbers are the same to the degree of accuracy we have
used, there is no point in continuing. We have thus obtained the sequence
TLFeBOOK

286
Sequences and series
of values:
−0.25, −0.3305084, −0.3247489, −0.3247179, −0.3247179.
Finally, we can check that we have found a good approximation to a
solution of the equation by substituting x = −0.3247179 into the function
f (x) = x3−3x2+2x+1, which gives 2.441×10−7. As this value is very
close to 0 this conﬁrms that we have found a reasonable approximation
to a solution of the equation f (x) = 0.
The convergence criterion
In Examples 12.34 and 12.35 we decided to stop the calculation when the
last two values found were equal. We had found the limit of the recurrence
relation to 7 s.f. In a computer algorithm, we could test if the last two
calculated values of x differ by a very small amount.
Example 12.36
A convergent sequence is deﬁned by a recurrence rela-
tion. The calculation should stop when the limit has been found to an
accuracy of at least three decimal places. Give a condition that could be
used in this case.
Solution
Assuming two consecutive terms are xn−1 and xn, then the
absolute difference between them is given by |xn −xn−1|. To test whether
this is small enough to accept xn as the limit to three decimal places we
use the fact that a number expressed to three decimal places could have
an absolute error of just less than 0.0005. So the condition we can use
to stop the algorithm could be |xn −xn−1| < 0.0005. If this condition is
satisﬁed we could then assume that xn is the limit to three decimal places.
To be on the safe side, however, it is better to perform the calculation one
ﬁnal time and check that it is also true that |xn+1 −xn| < 0.0005 and
then use xn+1 as the value of the limit which should be accurate to at least
three decimal places.
Example 12.37
A convergent sequence is deﬁned by a recurrence rela-
tion. The calculation should stop when the limit has been found to an
accuracy of at least 4 s.f. Give a condition that could be used in this case.
Solution
Assuming two consecutive terms are xn−1 and xn then the
absolute difference between them is given by |xn −xn−1|. To test whether
this is small enough to accept xn as the limit to 4 s.f. use the fact that a
number expressed to 4 s.f. can have an absolute relative error of just
less than 0.00005. As we do not know that value of the limit we must
approximate it by the last value calculated in the sequence, so the absolute
relative error is approximately
|xn −xn−1|
|xn|
so an appropriate condition would be
|xn −xn−1|
|xn|
< 0.00005
or
|xn −xn−1| < 0.00005|xn|.
As in the previous example it would be preferable to test that this condition
holds on at least two successive iterations. Hence, we could also check
TLFeBOOK

Sequences and series
287
that
|xn+1 −xn| < 0.00005|xn+1|
and take xn+1 as the limit of the sequence correct to four signiﬁcant
ﬁgures.
Divergence
A divergent sequence is one that does not tend to a ﬁnite limit. Some
examples of divergent sequences are:
(i)
1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 . . . which is an oscillating sequence,
(ii)
1, 2, 4, 8, 16 . . . which tends to plus inﬁnity,
(iii)
−1, −3, −5, . . . which tends to minus inﬁnity.
Recurrence relations that are used for some numerical method may not
always converge, particularly if the initial value is chosen inappropriately.
To check for this eventuality, it is usual to stop the algorithm after some
ﬁnite number of steps, maybe 100 or 1000 iterations, depending on the
problem. If no convergence has been found after that number of iterations
then it is considered that sequence is failing to converge.
12.9 Summary
1.
A sequence is a collection of objects arranged in a deﬁnite order. The
elements of a sequence can be represented by a1, a2, a3, . . . , an, . . .
2.
If a rule exists by which any term in the sequence can be found
then this may be used to express the general term of the sequence,
usually represented by an or a(n). This rule can also be expressed in
the form of a recurrence relation where an+1 is expressed in terms
of an, an−1, an−2, . . .
3.
During analog to digital (A/D) conversion, a signal is sampled and
can then be represented by a sequence of numbers. f (t) can be
represented by a(n) = f (nT ), where T is the sampling interval
and t = nT . The sampling theorem states that the sampling inter-
val must be less than T = 1/(2f ) seconds in order to be able to
represent a frequency of f Hz.
4.
A series is the sum of a sequence. To represent series we may use
sigma notation, using the capital Greek letter sigma, , to indicate
the summation process, for example,
n=10

n=0
1
2n
means ‘sum all the terms 1/2n for n from 0 to 10’.
5.
An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence where each term is
found by adding a ﬁxed amount, called the common difference, to
the previous term. If the ﬁrst term is a and the common difference
is d, then the general term is an = a + (n −1)d and the sum of the
ﬁrst n terms is given by
Sn = n
2(2a + (n −1)d)
or
Sn = n
2(a + l)
where l is the last term in the sequence and n is the number of terms.
6.
An geometric progression (GP) is a sequence where each term is
found by multiplying the previous term by a ﬁxed amount, called
TLFeBOOK

288
Sequences and series
the common ratio. If the ﬁrst term is a and the common ratio is r,
then the general term is an = arn−1, and the sum of the ﬁrst n terms
is given by
Sn = a(1 −rn)
1 −r
.
The sum to inﬁnity of a GP can be found if |r| < 1 and is given by
S∞=
a
1 −r .
7.
The binomial expansion gives
(a + b)n = an + nan−1b + n(n −1)
2!
an−2b2
+ n(n −1)(n −2)
3!
an−3b3 + · · ·
where n can be a whole number or a fraction.
8.
The Maclaurin series is a series expansion of a function about x = 0.
If a function f (x) is deﬁned for values of x around x = 0, within
some radius R, that is, for −R < x < R (or |x| < R) and if all its
derivatives are deﬁned then:
f (x) = f (0) + f ′(0)x + f ′′(0)
2!
x2 + f ′′′(0)
3!
x3
+ · · · + f (n)(0)
n!
xn + · · ·
This gives a power series with coefﬁcient sequence:
an = f (n)(0)
n!
where f (n)(0) is found by calculating the nth derivative of f (x)
with respect to x and then substituting x = 0.
9.
Maclaurin’s series is just a special case of Taylor series. A Taylor

L’Hopital’s rule is a way of ﬁnding the limit of a function at a
point where it is undetermined (i.e. it gives 0/0 at the point). The
TLFeBOOK

Sequences and series
289
rule states that if a function f (x) = g(x)/h(x) is indeterminate at
x = a then:
lim
x→a
g(x)
h(x) = lim
x→a
g′(x)
h′(x).
If g′(a)/h′(a) is deﬁned, we can then use
lim
x→a
g′(x)
h′(x) = g′(a)
h′(a)
and if g′(a)/h′(a) is indeterminate, we can use the rule again.
11.
To test if a sequence tends to a limit follow the following
procedure:
(a)
Choose a number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
(b)
Write all the terms in the sequence to that number of signiﬁcant
ﬁgures.
(c)
The sequence tends to a limit if the terms in the sequence, when
expressed to the agreed number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures becomes
constant, that is, do not change after some value of n.
This procedure must theoretically work for any chosen number of
signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
12.
The algorithm for solving an equation using Newton–Raphson
method can be described as
Step 1:
Take an equation and write it in the form f (x) = 0.
Step 2:
Take a guess at a solution
Step 3:
Calculate a new value for x using
x ←x −f (x)
f ′(x)
Step 4:
Repeat Step 3 until some convergence criterion has been
satisﬁed or until it is decided that the method has failed to
ﬁnd a solution.
13.
Convergence criteria can either be based on the testing the size of
the absolute error or the relative absolute error. To ﬁnd the limit of
a convergent sequence deﬁned by a recurrence relation, correct to
three decimal places, we can test for |xn−xn−1| < 0.0005 and to be
correct to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures we could test for |xn −xn−1| <
0.0005|xn|. It is also necessary to put a limit on the number of
iterations of some algorithm to check for the eventuality that the
sequence fails to converge (is divergent).

Introduction
The widespread use of computers to solve engineering problems means
that it is important to be able to represent problems in a form suitable for
solution by a computer. Matrices are used to represent: systems of lin-
ear equations; transformations used in computer graphics or for robotic
control; road, electrical and communication networks, and stresses and
strains in materials. A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers of dimen-
sion m×n where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns
in the matrix. Matrices are also useful because they enable us to consider
an array of numbers as a single object, represent it by a single symbol,
and manipulate these symbols conveniently. In this chapter, we look at
applications of matrices and arithmetic operations on matrices and some
common numerical methods. We shall also look at the problem of solv-
ing systems of linear equations. The methods of solving linear systems
of equations are well understood and we only need to be able to solve
simple cases of such problems ‘by hand’. However, it is important to
be able to express a problem in matrix form and also appreciate situa-
tions where no solution exists or where more than one solution exists.
This allows to analyse the problems of ill-conditioning of systems of
equations, which can lead to instability in the solution and the problem of
over- or under-determinacy, where either we have too much information,
leading to possibly contradictory conditions, or we have not got enough
to produce a single set of solutions for the unknowns.
We shall also look at the eigenvalue problem. The technique of ﬁnding
eigenvalues will become particularly important when applied to systems
of differential equations which we meet in Chapter 14.
13.2 Matrices
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. They may also be used as a
simple store of information as in the following example.
Every weekday a household orders pints of milk, loaves of bread, and
yoghurt from a milk lorry. The orders for the week can be displayed

We shall return to these examples later. Also in the chapter we will see
that linear equations can be written in matrix form.
Notation
A matrix is represented by a capital letter A (bold) or by [aij] where aij
represents a typical element in the ith row and jth column of the matrix.
We represent a general matrix in the following form:

In order to refer to the element which is in the third row and the second
column we can say a32. The matrix




is a 3 × 2 matrix (read as 3 by 2) as it has 3 rows and 2 columns.
The sum and difference of matrices
The sum and difference of matrices is found by adding or subtracting
corresponding elements of the matrix. Only matrices of exactly the same
dimension can be added or subtracted.

two vectors. Multiplication is only possible if the number of columns in
A is the same as the number of rows in B. For instance, if A is 2×3 it can
only multiply matrices that are 3 × n where n could be any dimension.
The result of a 2 × 3 multiplying a 3 × 4 is a 2 × 4 matrix. Notice the

plication as in the following two examples. In the ﬁrst, we return to our
household shopping example.

Solution
The cost each day is made up of the number of pints of milk
times the cost of a pint plus the number of loaves of bread times the
cost of a loaf plus the number of cartons of yoghurt times the cost of the
yoghurt. In other words, we can ﬁnd the cost each day by performing
matrix multiplication

communication network.
Example 13.5
Figure 13.1 represents a communication network where
the vertices a,b,f,g represent ofﬁces and vertices c,d,e represent switching
centres. The numbers marked along the edges represent the number of
connections between any two vertices. Calculate the number of routes
from a,b to f,g.
Solution
The number of routes from a to f can be calculated by taking
the number via c plus the number via d plus the number via e. In each
case, this is given by multiplying the number of connections along the
edges connecting a to c, c to f, etc giving the number of routes from a to
f as: 3 × 2 + 4 × 6 + 1 × 1.
We can see that we can get the number of routes by matrix multiplica-
tion. The network from ab to cde is represented by:

Solving matrix equations
To solve matrix equations, we use the same ideas about equivalent equa-
tions that we have used before. As in ordinary equations, we can ‘do
the same things to both sides’ in order to ﬁnd equivalent equations.
It is important to remember that division by a matrix has not been
deﬁned. In order to ‘undo’ matrix multiplication we have to multiply
by an inverse matrix, where it exists, and we need to specify whether
we are pre- or post-multiplying. This is necessary because matrices do
not obey the commutative law (AB ̸= BA). If we pre- or post-multiply
both sides of an equation by a matrix we must also be able to justify
that the dimensions of the expressions are such that the multiplication
is possible. Also if we add or subtract a matrix from both sides of the
equation it must have exactly the same dimension as the current matrix
expression.
TLFeBOOK

Systems of linear equations, matrices, and determinants
Example 13.12
Given that A, B, and C are matrices and AB = C where
A and B are non-singular, ﬁnd expressions for B and A.
Solution
In this case, we are told that A and B are invertible, so they
must be square and therefore C must also be square and of the same
dimension. To ﬁnd B we wish to ‘get rid’ of the A term on the left-hand
side. We pre-multiply both sides of the equation by A−1
AB = C and given A is invertible
⇔
A−1AB = A−1C.
Now using A−1A = I, the unit matrix, we have
IB = A−1C.
As the unit matrix multiplied by any matrix leaves it unchanged, we have
⇔
B = A−1C.
To ﬁnd an expression for A, use
AB = C
given that B is invertible, we post-multiply by B−1
⇔
ABB−1 = CB−1.
Now using BB−1 = I, the unit matrix, we have
AI = CB−1.
As the unit matrix multiplied by any matrix leaves it unchanged, we have
⇔
A = CB−1.
Remember that it is always important to specify whether you are
pre- or post-multiplying when solving matrix equations. A term like
B−1AB cannot be simpliﬁed because we cannot swap the order, as we
would do with numbers.
13.3
Transformations
On a computer graphics screen an object is represented by a set of coor-
dinates, either with reference to the screen origin or with reference to
the origin of some window created by the graphical user interface (GUI).
We may wish to move the object around inside its window. We shall
consider in this section only two-dimensional objects as dealing with
three-dimensional objects would add the complication of needing to rep-
resent a perspective view. Ideas about transformations are also important
when considering movement of a robotic arm.
There are three ways of moving an object without affecting its overall
size or shape: rotation, reﬂection and translation. We could also stretch it
or compress it in some direction – the operation of scaling.
We shall look at how to perform these operations using matrices and
vectors. We can check that the operations performed are those that we
expected by looking at the effect on some simple shapes. In most of these
examples, we look at the effect of a unit square at the origin, deﬁned by the
points A (0,0), B(1,0), C (1,1), D (0,1). The outcome of the transformation
is called the image which we will represent by the points A′, B′, C′, D′.
The transformation, T, is a function whose domain and codomain is the
plane (which is referred to as R2). The term ‘mapping’ is also used in this
context. It has exactly the same meaning as function, but is more often
used when referring to geometrical problems.

This transformation is shown in Figure 13.2.
Sometimes, it is useful to be able to rotate the axes rather than the
object. For instance, the object may be held by a robotic arm and we want
the arm to rotate but keep the orientation of the object the same. This is
picture for the tea drinking robot in Figure 13.3.
In this case, if we rotate the axes Ox, Oy, by the position of the object
remains the same but even so has new coordinates relative to the the
transformed axes OX, OY. If the axes rotate through 30◦, then the object
moves relative to the axes by −30◦. So to rotate the axes by we multiply
the position vectors of the points

The image of the unit square is pictured in Figure 13.9(b).
Note that the order of the transformations is important.
Sometimes, we might need to use a trick of temporarily moving the
axes in order to perform certain transformations. Supposing we want to
scale by 2 along the line x = y we can rotate the axes temporarily so
that the new X-axis lies along the line that was previously x = y, then
perform X scaling, and then rotate back again, so the axes are back in
their original position. This is done in the next example.

Solution
First, we rotate the axes by 45◦, so that the OX-axis will lie
along the line that was previously x = y. This is pictured in Figure 13.10.
Figure 13.10
(a) The line
x = y is at 45◦to the Ox axis.
If we rotate the axes by 45◦,
the new OX axis will lie in this
direction. This is shown in (b).
The matrix that transforms the coordinates so they are relative to the
new axes at an angle of 45◦is given by:

closed loop is zero. This can also be expressed as: the voltage impressed
on a closed loop is equal to the sum of the voltage drops in the rest of
the loop.

Kirchoff’s current law (KCL): At any point of a circuit, the sum of the
in-ﬂowing currents is equal to the sum of the out-ﬂowing currents.
By Ohm’s law we know the voltage drop across a resistor is given by
V = IR, where R is the resistance of the resistor. Two loops have been
identiﬁed in Figure 13.12 and by using KVL and Ohm’s law in loop 1
we get
3I2 −2I3 = 0.
Now looking at loop 2, we get
3I1 −8 + 4I1 + 2I3 = 0
⇔
7I1 + 2I3 = 8.
Finally, we use the current law at one of the nodes to give
I1 = I2 + I3
⇐⇒
I1 −I2 −I3 = 0
Finally, we can list all the equations we have found

and the problem is now to ﬁnd a solution which satisﬁes all of these
equations simultaneously.
This is called a system of equations. In many electrical networks, there
will be far more than three unknown currents. In such situations, it is
impractical to solve the equations without the use of a computer. However,
we can discover a number of important principles and problems involved
in solving systems of linear equations by looking at some simple cases.
The ﬁrst problem we have is that it is possible to get more that these
three equations from the network given in Figure 13.12. Using KVL in
the outer loop would give
7I1 + 3I2 = 8
and KCL at the other node gives
I2 + I3 = I1
⇔
−I1 + I2 + I3 = 0
We therefore have ﬁve equations and only three unknowns.
Luckily, it is possible to show that these equations are a consistent set,
that is, it is possible to ﬁnd a solution. We shall return to solve for I1, I2,
and I3 later. First, we shall examine all the possibilities when we have
only two unknown quantities.
Systems of equations in two unknowns
The equation
ax + by = c
where a, b, c are constants is a linear equation in two unknowns (or vari-
ables) x and y. Because there are two unknowns we need two axes to
represent it, and therefore the graph can be drawn in a plane.
Because the graph only involves terms in x, y and the constant term and
no other powers of either x or y, we know that the graph of the equation
TLFeBOOK

316
Systems of linear equations, matrices, and determinants
is a straight line, as we saw in Chapter 2. Examples of graphs of linear
equations in two unknowns are given in Figure 13.13.
We call a solution to the equation a pair of values for x and y which
satisfy the equation; that is, when they are substituted they give a true
expression. A solution to the equation x + y = 1 is x = 0.5, y = 0.5
because if we substitute these values we obtain a true expression:
0.5 + 0.5 = 1.
Figure 13.13
An equation
with two unknowns can be
represented as a line in a
plane: (a) x + y = 1;
(b) 2x −y = 5; (c) 2y = 3;
(d) 3x = −1.
However, there are many other solutions to x + y = 1, for instance
x = 2, y = −1 or x = 2.5, y = −1.5, etc. We say that the equation is
indeterminate because there are any number of solutions to the equation
x + y = 1. In fact, any point on the line x + y = 1 is a solution
to the equation. We can express the solutions in terms of x or y (e.g.
x = 1 −y) therefore the solutions are (1 −y, y) where y can be any
number. Alternatively y = 1 −x gives solutions (x, 1 −x) where x can
be any number.
A system of two linear equations with
two unknowns
We want to ﬁnd values for x and y which solve both a1x + b1y = c1 and
a2x + b2y = c2 simultaneously. The problem could be expressed as
(a1x + b1y = c1) ∧(a2x + b2y = c2)
When we talk of systems of equations it is understood that we want all
of the equations to hold simultaneously so they are usually just listed as
a1x + b1y = c1
a2x + b2y = c2
Each equation can be represented geometrically by a straight line.
For example, the system
3x + 4y = 7
x + 2y = 2
can be represented by the pair of straight lines as in Figure 13.14.
We can ﬁnd the point where the two straight lines cross by using
substitution as follows.
Example 13.20
Solve the following system of equations using substi-
tution:
3x + 4y = 7
x + 2y = 2.
Solution
We begin by numbering the equations in order to identify them
3x + 4y = 7
(13.1)
x + 2y = 2
(13.2)
From Equation (13.2) we can express x in terms of y as
x + 2y = 2
⇔
x = 2 −2y
(subtracting 2y from both sides)

Systems of linear equations, matrices, and determinants
317
Figure 13.14
A system of
two equations in two
unknowns: 3x + 4y = 7 and
x + 2y = 2.
Now substitute x = 2 −2y into Equation (13.1) to give
3(2 −2y) + 4y = 7
⇔
6 −6y + 4y = 7
⇔
6 −2y = 7
⇔
−2y = 1
(subtracting 6 from both sides)
⇔
y = −1
2
(dividing both sides by −2)
⇔
y = −0.5
Now we can use x = 2 −2y to ﬁnd x by substituting y = −0.5 to give
x = 2 −2(−0.5)
⇔
x = 2 + 1
⇔
x = 3
The solution is given by x = 3 and y = −0.5, which can be represented
by the pair of values for (x, y) of (3, 0.5).
An alternative method of solution is to use elimination.
Example 13.21
Solve the following system of equations using elimi-
nation:
3x + 4y = 7
x + 2y = 2.
Solution
To solve the system of equations we look for a way of adding or
subtracting multiples of one equation from the other in order to eliminate
one of the variables. Multiply the second equation by 3 and leave the ﬁrst
the same. We choose these numbers in order to get the coefﬁcients of x
in both equations to be the same.
3x + 4y = 7
3x + 6y = 6.
Subtract the equations to give
−2y = 1 ⇔y = −1
2 = −0.5.
TLFeBOOK

Systems of linear equations, matrices, and determinants
Figure 13.15
The graphs of
equations x + 2y = 1 and
2x + 4y = 2 are coincident.
The graph of one lies on top
of the other.
Substitute this into the ﬁrst equation to give
3x + 4(−0.5) = 7
⇔
3x −2 = 7
⇔
3x = 9
⇔
x = 3.
The solution is given by x = 3 and y = −0.5, which can be represented
by the pair of values for (x, y) of (3, −0.5).
The point (3, −0.5) is the point on the graph where the two lines cross.
This is the only point which lies both on the ﬁrst graph and the second
graph. It is the only point which satisﬁes both equations simultaneously.
Hence, we say there is a unique solution to the system of equations.
The system of equations is said to be determined because there is a single
solution. The system of equations is also said to be consistent because it
is possible to ﬁnd a solution.
We could have the system of equations:
x + 2y = 1
2x + 4y = 2.
If we plot these lines we ﬁnd that they are coincident, that is, one line lies
on top of the other as in Figure 13.15.
In this case, the second equation, 2x + 4y = 2, can be obtained
by multiplying the ﬁrst equation by 2. We say that the equations are
dependent. Two equations are dependent if one can be obtained from the
other by multiplying by a constant or by adding a constant to both sides.
As any point that lies on x + 2y = 1 also lies on 2x + 4y = 2, there is
no unique solution to the system of equations.
We say that the system of equations is indeterminate as there exist any
number of solutions to the system, that is, the system reduces to only
one equation. However, the system of equations is said to be consistent,
because at least one solution exists.
Example solutions are:
x = 2, y = 0.5 or (2, −0.5)
x = 3, y = −1 or (3, −1)
x = 4, y = −1.5 or (4, −1.5)
The solution set can be written as (x, (1 −x)/2), where x can take any
value or as (1 −2y, y), where y can take any value.
TLFeBOOK

Systems of linear equations, matrices, and determinants
319
If we try to use elimination to solve the equations
x + 2y = 1
2x + 4y = 2
we ﬁnd that one equation reduces to 0 = 0, that is, a condition that is
always true.
Example 13.22
Solve, using elimination:
x + 2y = 1
2x + 4y = 2.
Solution
x + 2y = 1
2x + 4y = 2
multiply the ﬁrst equation by 2 to give
2x + 4y = 2
2x + 4y = 2
On subtraction we get
0 = 0
which is always true, thus indicating that the system of equations is
indeterminate. The solutions are therefore any points lying on the line
x + 2y = 1.
The third possibility for a system of equations is one that has no
solutions at all. Such a system is as follows:
x + 2y = 1
2x + 4y = 5
If we plot these equations we ﬁnd that they are parallel, as in Figure 13.16.
From the geometrical interpretation, it is therefore clear that no solution
exists to this system of equations as no point on the line x+2y = 1 lies on
the line 2x + 4y = 5. We say that the system of equations is inconsistent
because no solutions exist.
Figure 13.16
The graphs of
x + 2y = 1 and 2x + 4y = 5
are parallel. There are no
points in common between
the two graphs.
TLFeBOOK

320
Systems of linear equations, matrices, and determinants
If we used elimination to attempt to solve an inconsistent system of
equations like these, then we will ﬁnd that we will get an impossible
condition, such as
0 = 3
which is false. This situation indicates that there are no solutions and the
equations are inconsistent.
Example 13.23
Solve, using elimination
x + 2y = 1
2x + 4y = 5.
Solution
Multiply the ﬁrst equation by 2 to give
2x + 4y = 2
2x + 4y = 5.
Subtracting the equations, we get
0 = −3.
This condition is false. This indicates that the system of equations are
inconsistent and there are no solutions.
We can express systems of equations in matrix form as
Av = b
where A is the matrix of coefﬁcients,
v =


and b is the vector of constants on the right-hand side of the equations.
For the three cases we have looked at in Examples 13.21–13.23, we get
the following:

2
 = (3 · 2) −(1 · 4) = 6 −4 = 2.

shows that the system of equations has a unique solution.

This can be shown to hold in general. If all the determinants formed in

322
Systems of linear equations, matrices, and determinants
vector of constant terms are non-zero, then this shows that the system is
inconsistent and there are no solutions.
We can summarize the results of this section as follows. For a system
of equations (assuming we have as many equations as unknowns) there
are three possibilities
Case 1: A determined system has a unique solution which can be found
by using elimination. Geometrically, the solution is a single point which
(in the case a a system in two unknowns) represents the intersection of
the two lines. The determinant of the coefﬁcients is non-zero. The system
is both consistent and determined.
Case 2: An undetermined system has many solutions. If elimination
is used to solve the system it will result in a condition like 0 = 0,
which is always true. Geometrically the solutions lie (for a system in
two unknowns) anywhere along a line. The determinant of the coefﬁ-
cients is zero, as are any determinants found by replacing a column in
the matrix of coefﬁcients by the vector of constant terms. The system is
undetermined but consistent (as there are solutions).
Case 3: An inconsistent system has no solutions. If elimination is used
to solve the system it will result in a condition like 0 = 3, which is
always false. Geometrically, for a system in two unknowns, the system is
represented by parallel lines which have no points in common, hence no
solutions. The determinant of the coefﬁcients is zero but at least one of
the determinants found by replacing a column in the matrix of coefﬁcients
by the vector of constant terms is non-zero. The system is inconsistent.
For Case 1, the solution of the system can be found by using the inverse
of the matrix of coefﬁcients. We can represent the system by
Av = b.
As the determinant of A is non-zero, we know that A has an inverse
A−1. We pre-multiply both sides of the matrix equation by A−1 giving
A−1Av = A−1b
as A−1A = I, the unit matrix and Iv = v
we get
v = A−1b
Av = b ∧|A| ̸= 0 ⇔v = A−1b.
Example 13.24
Solve
3x + 4y = 7
x + 2y = 2
by ﬁnding the inverse of the matrix of coefﬁcients.

So the solution of this system of equations is x = 3 and y = −0.5.
For a 2×2 system, this method of solving a system of equations is quite
straightforward. However, for larger systems a solution by ﬁnding the
inverse involves nearly twice as many operations as that by elimination
of variables and therefore should not be used as a method of solving
equations.
Equations with three unknowns
For three unknowns we need three axes to represent the equations.
Each equation is represented by a plane, for example, Figure 13.17 shows
the plane which represents the equation x + y + z = 1.
Figure 13.17
The plane
given by the equation
x + y + z = 1.
Two planes, if they intersect, will intersect along a line and if a third
independent equation is given then the three planes will intersect at a
point. More than three unknowns cannot be represented geometrically.
However many unknowns there are in a system of equations, the three
types of systems which we identiﬁed as Cases 1–3 remain as do the
methods to be used to distinguish between a determined, indeterminate,
and inconsistent system.
We shall later look at ﬁnding the determinant and inverse of larger
matrices, but ﬁrst we look at a systematic way of doing elimination which
is suitable for a computer solution of a system of equations.

elimination
Gauss elimination is a structured process for the elimination of variables
in one of the equations. It is easy to generalize to larger systems of
equations and it is relatively numerically stable, making it suitable for
use with a computer.
Gauss elimination is performed in stages. At Stage 1, we concentrate on
the ﬁrst column, the coefﬁcients of x. The idea is to make the coefﬁcient
of the ﬁrst equation 1 and eliminate the variable from the other equation(s)
by using multiples of the ﬁrst equation. Equation 1 is therefore the pivotal
equation for Stage 1.
Example 13.25
Solve
3x + 4y = 7
5x −8y = 8
using Gauss elimination.
Solution
We can either write out the equation each time we perform
a step or we can abbreviate the solution by expressing the equations in
short hand as an augmented matrix

We shall present both notations at the same time. We shall refer to the
elements in the augmented matrix by

For the ﬁrst step, the ﬁrst equation is the pivotal equation:

5x −8y = 8


Step 2: Take 5 times the ﬁrst equation away from the second equation in
order to eliminate the term in x in the second equation:
x + 4
3y = 7
3
−8y −( 4
3y × 5) = 8 −7
3 × 5
which is the same as

We now already have the solution for y and we can obtain the solution for
x by substitution into the ﬁrst equation. This is called ’back-substitution’.

⇔
x = 7
3 −1

⇔
x = 2.
Therefore, the solution is (2, 0.25).
We see that the point of the exercise is to write the system of equations
so that the ﬁnal equation contains only one variable and the last but one
equation has up to two variables, etc. The matrix of coefﬁcients should
be in upper triangular form like:


The augmented matrix is then like

which is said to be in echelon form. Once this form has been achieved,
then back-substitution can be performed to ﬁnd the value of the variables.
Example 13.26
Solve the system of equations
2x + y −2z = −1
2x −3y + 2z = 9
−x + y −z = −3.5.

1.5y −2z = −4
Stage 2
Stage 2 concerns the second column. We use the second row to eliminate
the elements below a22. Here Row 2 is the pivotal row.
Step 1: Divide the second equation by the coefﬁcient a22:
x + 0.5y −z = −0.5

was as follows

−0.5z = −0.25

Divide the third equation by the coefﬁcient of z.

327
Find y from the second equation
y = −2.5 + z ⇔y = −2.5 + 0.5
⇔
y = −2
Substitute into the ﬁrst equation to ﬁnd x
x + 0.5(−2) −0.5 = −0.5
⇔
x −1.5 = −0.5
⇔
x = 1
So the solution of the system of equations is (1, −2, 0.5).
Check: To check, substitute x = 1, y = −2, and z = 0.5 into the original
equations
2x + y −2z = −1
2x −3y + 2z = 9
−x + y −z = −3.5
giving
2(1) + (−2) −2(0.5) = −1, which is true
2(1) −3(−2) + 2(0.5) = 9, which is true
−(1) + (−2) −0.5 = −3.5, which is true.
Now we can solve the system of equations for the electrical network,
which was the introductory example of Section 13.4.

Indeterminacy and inconsistency
When we analysed systems of equations in Section 13.5, we saw that one
of the equations reducing to 0 = 0, indicates that we have an indetermi-
nate system; that is that there will be many solutions. If, in the process of
performing Gauss elimination, we ﬁnd a row of zeros then we know that
we have an indeterminate system. We can use the remaining equations to
eliminate as many of the unknowns as possible, giving a solution which
will still involve one or more of the variables. This will give a whole line
or possibly (in three dimensions) a plane of solutions.
If we come across a row that is zero everywhere in the matrix of coefﬁ-
cients but has a non-zero constant term we have found an equation 0 = c,
which is false. This is an inconsistent system and has no solutions.
Order of the equations
At the beginning of each stage in Gauss elimination, the order of the
rows may be swapped (other than those already used in previous stages
as the pivotal equation). We will have to swap the equations if the next
‘pivotal’ equation has a zero coefﬁcient for the next variable to be elim-
inated. It is usual, although we have not illustrated this point, to always
consider swapping the order of the equations, in order to choose the
equation with the largest absolute value of the coefﬁcient in the term to
be used for eliminating, as the pivotal equation. This is called partial piv-
oting. This procedure as an attempt to avoid problems with equations that
may become ill conditioned in the course if performing the elimination.
The equations are ill conditioned when a small change in the coefﬁcients
of the equations causes a large change in the values of the solutions, and
in such equations rounding errors can become large and cause signiﬁcant
inaccuracies in the solutions. We have not performed partial pivoting in
these examples as they are only presented to give an idea of the method.
It is assumed that for any real life problem a computer algorithm will
be used to solve the system of equations, and such an algorithm will
incorporate partial pivoting.

Finding the inverse by elimination
To ﬁnd the inverse using elimination, we write the matrix we need to
invert on the left and the unit matrix on the right. We perform operations
on both matrices at the same time. The method, called Gauss–Jordan
elimination, begins in the same way as Gauss elimination. When we have
upper triangular form for the matrix we metaphorically turn the problem
upside down and eliminate the upper triangle also.

Each of the terms on the right-hand side of this deﬁnition is of the form
aibj where i and j are different choices of the numbers 1 and 2. We
can deﬁne higher order determinants by using ideas of permutations.
We notice that the term a1b2 above has a positive sign because the indices
1 and 2 appear in order, whereas the term a2b1 has a negative sign because
the indices 2,1 are reversed.

of swaps of the numbers, beginning with the order 123. If it can only
be obtained by an odd number of swaps then the permutation is odd.
For example, 231 is even because we can reach it by ﬁrst swapping 1
and 2 giving 213 and then swapping 1 and 3. Alternatively, we could
have interchanged 2 and 3 giving 132 and 1 and 3 giving 312, 2 and 1
giving 321, 3 and 2 giving 231. Whatever way we use to get to the order
231 involves an even number of steps. Similarly we say that a permutation
of 123 is odd if it involves an odd number of adjacent interchanges.

determinants as follows:
a1b2c3 −a1b3c2 −a2b1c3 + a3b1c2 + a2b3c1 −a3b2c1

The 2×2 determinants that appear in this expression are called minors.
This formula for the determinant is called the expansion by the ﬁrst row,
because the numbers a1, b1, c1 which multiply the minors are from the
ﬁrst row of the matrix.
Note that the minor multiplying a1 is the (2 × 2) determinant obtained
from the original array by crossing out the row and column in which a1
appears, as follows

Similarly, the number multiplying b1 is the determinant found by
crossing out the row and the column in which b1 appears.
We could also ﬁnd the determinant by expanding about the ﬁrst column
a1b2c3 −a1b3c2 −a2b1c3 + a2b3c1 + a3b1c2 −a3b2c1

The inverse of a matrix using
(Adjoint(A))/|A|
We have already seen how to ﬁnd the inverse of a matrix by using
elimination. It is also possible to ﬁnd the inverse by the following
procedure:
(1)
Find the matrix of minors.
(2)
Multiply the minor for row i and column j by (−1)i+j. This is then
called the matrix of cofactors.
TLFeBOOK

(3)
Take the transpose of the matrix of cofactors to ﬁnd the adjoint
matrix.
(4)
Divide by the determinant of the original matrix.
Thisprocedurerarelyneedstobeusedandonlyusuallyifwehaveamatrix
which involves some unknown variables or expresses some formula and
we would like to ﬁnd the inverse formula. It would never be used as a
numerical procedure, as it is both numerically unstable and also uses a
very large number of operations (of the order of n! operations, where n
is the dimension of the matrix, whereas elimination is only of the order
of n3).

13.7
Eigenvectors
and eigenvalues
In Example 13.17, we looked at the problem of scaling along the line
x = y and we saw that the matrix
	 3
2
1
2
1
2
3
2

represents a scaling along the line y = x and it leaves points along the
line y = −x unchanged. This means that any vector in the direction (1,1)
will simply be multiplied by 2 and any vector in the direction (−1,1) will
remain unchanged after multiplication by this matrix. Other vectors will
undergo a mixed effect.
Supposing we know that a matrix A represents a scaling but without
knowing the direction of the scaling or by how much it scales. Is there
any way we can ﬁnd that direction and the scaling constant?
The problem then is to ﬁnd a vector v which is simply scaled by some
currently unknown amount λ when multiplied by A, and v must be such
that
Av = λv
If we manage to ﬁnd values of λ and v we call these the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the matrix A.
We shall solve this for
	 3

as we know the result that we expect to get.

Unfortunately, the solution to this gives x = 0 and y = 0, which is not
very enlightening (it is called the trivial solution).
However, we started by saying that we wanted to ﬁnd the direction in
which this matrix scaled any vector. That is, we want to ﬁnd a whole
line of solutions. We can use a result that we found from solving systems
of equations. The equations may have a whole line of solutions if the
determinant of the coefﬁcients is 0.
Hence, we need to ﬁnd λ such that

4 = 0 ⇔λ2 −3λ + 2 = 0.
This factorizes to
(λ −2)(λ −1) = 0 ⇔λ = 1 ∨λ = 1.
Hence, the eigenvalues of the matrix A are 1 and 2. To ﬁnd the vectors
which go with each of these eigenvalues we substitute into the equations

We notice that these equations are dependent, which we would have
expected as by setting the determinant = 0 we were looking for an
undetermined system.
We have
−1
2x + 1
2y = 0
⇔
x = y.
This means that any vector (x, y) where y = x will be scaled by 2 if
multiplied by the matrix A. The eigenvector can be given as (1,1) as it is
only necessary to indicate the direction.

The other eigenvalue, λ = 1, gives
1
2x + 1
2y = 0
1
2x + 1
2y = 0.
Again, the equations are dependent and we have x+y = 0. The eigenvec-
tor is any vector (x, y) where x = −y so this gives the direction (−1,1).
As not all matrices represent scaling, it is not always possible to ﬁnd
real eigenvalues. In particular, a rotation matrix has no real eigenvalues
for angle of rotation, θ ̸= 0. Another point to note is that in this example
the eigenvectors were at right angles to each other. This is only true for
symmetric matrices (which we had in this case).
The method can be summarized as follows: To ﬁnd the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of A
(1)
Solve |A −λI| = 0 to ﬁnd the eigenvalues. This is called the
characteristic equation.
(2)
For each value of λ found, substitute into
(A −λI)v = 0
and ﬁnd v. This will be an undetermined system so we shall ﬁnd
at least a whole line of solutions. Choose any vector lying in the
direction of the line.

6x + 3y = 0
⇔
2x + y = 0
y = −2x
The vector is therefore (x, y) where y = −2x, giving (x, −2x). We only
need the direction of the vector so choose (1, −2) by substituting x = 1

13.8 Least
squares data
ﬁtting
Matrix methods can be employed to the problem of ﬁnding the ‘best ﬁt’
line through a set of data. In Chapter 2 we performed a ﬁt by eye to a
set of data points. We drew a scatter diagram of the data and if the data
appeared, more or less, to ﬁt on a line then we would draw the line by
hand and then use any two points lying on the line, to ﬁnd the equation
of the line. We do not expect experimental data to be exact and that is
the reason that the data points do not lie exactly on a line. We shall now
look at the method of least squares, which can be used to compute the
‘best ﬁt’ line. The method is called ‘least squares’ because it minimizes
the squared error between the data points and the equation of the line
found. The method is justiﬁed in the following example.
We start with two sets of data which we suspect are related linearly.
Example 13.33
A student was late for a particularly interesting engi-
neeringmathslectureandwasthereforewalkingbrisklytowardthelecture
hall in a straight line at approximately constant speed b. The student’s
position x (metres) at time t (seconds) is given by

151
We can plot these points on a scatter diagram, as in Figure 13.18.
We can see that they lie on an approximate straight line. We need to
decide which is the ‘best’ straight line to draw. One way is to ﬁt the
straight line, y = a + bx, to a set of data points (xi, yi) so that the sum
of the squares of the vertical distances of the points from the straight line
drawn is minimum. This is illustrated in Figure 13.19.
In order to ﬁt the line y = a+bx, we can vary the values of a and b until
it satisﬁes our condition for minimum squared error. If the data points are
(xi, yi), then the sum of the squares of the errors is given by
E =

i
(yi −a −bxi)2
We can vary a and b to make this a minimum. However, E is a function of
two variables a and b. We know how to ﬁnd the minima or maxima with

respect to one variable, which we looked at in Chapter 11. We shall look in
more detail at functions of two variables in Chapter 17. To minimize with
respect to two variables we begin by differentiating with respect to each
variable in turn keeping the other variable constant. This is called partial
differentiation. The ideas used in ﬁnding stationary values are the same
as that for one variable although the method of distinguishing between
types of stationary values is slightly more involved because the function
represents a two-dimensional surface drawn in three dimensions rather
than a simple curve. A partial derivative is indicated by using a curly d,
∂, for the derivative and ∂E/∂a is read as ‘partial dE by da’

where n is the number of data points.
Here, we have not attempted to justify that this is actually a minimum
point (we have only shown it to give a stationary point). We can now
illustrate the method for ﬁnding the values of a and b which minimize the
sum of the squared errors. At the start of this example we had a set of data
which we wish to ﬁt to a function x = a+bt where the dependent variable
is x and the independent variable is t. We wish to ﬁnd the values of a and
b so that x = a + bt gives a least squares ﬁt to the data. The number of
data points is 6, so we have as the normal equations:

75a + 1375b = 10300
Solving
450a+5625b = 56475
450a+8250b = 61800

⇒b ≈2.03
6a + 75(2.03) = 754 ⇒a ≈100.14
We have a = 100.14 and b = 2.03. Hence, the line of best ﬁt is
x = 100.14 + 2.03t.
Curve ﬁtting
The same method for ﬁtting a straight line can be generalized to ﬁt any
polynomial. For example, it could appear that our data would be better
ﬁtted to a parabola.

The data are given in Table 13.2. The normal equations are:

13b0 + 57b1 + 289b2 = 29

13.9 Summary
1.
Matrices are used to represent information in a way suitable for use
by a computer. They can represent, among other things, systems
of linear equations, transformations, and networks. A matrix is a
rectangular array of numbers of dimension m × n where m is the
number of rows and n is the number of columns.
2.
To add or subtract matrices add or subtract each corresponding
element. The matrices must be of exactly the same dimension. To
multiply two matrices, C = AB, the number of columns in matrix A
must equal the number of rows in matrix B. The i, jth element of C
is found by multiplying the ith row of A by the jth column of B.

The unit matrix, I, leaves any matrix unchanged under multiplication.

Introduction
In order to model most physical situations we need to simplify their
description. The idea of a system is central to this simpliﬁcation. We
identify the important elements that interact within the system. The only
external interactions characterized as system inputs and the outputs are
the quantities related to the system behaviour which we are interested
in measuring. For instance, in examining the suspension system of a car
we consider the system input to be forces exerted on the wheels of the
car. The important elements in the system are the mass of the car and the
springs and dampers used to connect the body of the car to the suspension
links. We are interested in measuring the amount of vertical movement
of the car and the velocity of that movement in response, mainly, to a
bumpy road. We can examine the behaviour of the system for various
external forces – building up a picture of how the system behaves in
normal driving conditions. We do not need to concern ourselves with an
exact model of the surface of the major motorways. In this way we have
managed to separate the problem of modelling the system from modelling
the environment in which it is operating. A system with a single input
and output is pictured in Figure 14.1.
Figure 14.1
A system has
an input f (t) which produces
an output response y(t).
Dynamic physical processes involve variables which are interdepend-
ent and constantly changing. When modelling the system we will obtain
relationships between variables, many of which will be related through
derivatives. Even in a simple system with a mass, spring, and damper,
there are many variables which can be identiﬁed, for example the exten-
sion of the spring, and its velocity and acceleration, the potential energy
stored in the spring and the force exerted by it, and the force exerted by
the damper. A choice of variables that completely describe the system is
an important task in systems analysis. These variables are then called the
state variables. These can be related to each other and the system inputs
through a system of ﬁrst-order differential equations which are found by
using scientiﬁc laws and engineering principles to model the system. The
system output, which is some quantity that we wish to compare with
the response of a real system, can then be calculated from the values of
the state variables.
A differential equation is one that involves some derivatives of the
dependent variable, for example, dy/dt = ky is a differential equation.
TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations
347
We have already looked at a number of examples of differential equations.
The simplest case, when the solution can be found by integration, was
looked at in Chapter 7 and then we found that exponential functions are
solutions to differential equations of the form dy/dt = ky in Chapter 8
and in Chapter 10 we looked at the problem of circular motion and found
that exponential functions are also solutions to equations of the form
d2y/dt2 = −ω2y. In simple equations, we look for a solution which is a
number. When solving a differential equation our idea of a solution is to
ﬁnd an explicit function for y in terms of t.
We will only be concerned with single input, single output (SISO)
systems in which case there are two ways of proceeding in order to solve
the system of differential equations. The system may be reduced to a
single differential equation and then solved, or the system may be solved
directly. These two methods correspond, in systems theory, to the transfer
function description of the system or a state variable description.
The types of differential equations we shall look at are all linear; that
is, they involve no powers of y, the independent variable or powers of the
derivative or products of any of these. Any real system will, of course have
some non-linear behaviour. However, we usually assume that either the
non-linearities present are not very important or that it is possible to ana-
lyse a system as locally linear. Another important assumption used is that
time invariance, that is, operating the system now or in an hours time with
exactly the same input and initial conditions will yield the same result.
The method of solution we use for ﬁnding a particular solution of
differential equations in this chapter is called the method of unknown
coefﬁcients. An alternative method, using Laplace transforms, is more
widely applied, and we shall look at them in the next chapter.
Differential equations are used to analyse systems that are subject to
continuous or piecewise continuous inputs. It may be necessary, or prefer-
able, to develop a discrete model of the system. A discrete model may be
used if the exact nature of the system is unknown and we attempt to predict
its nature by recording its response to various inputs. The recording of the
system inputs and response will generally be stored in digital form and
the data processed in digital form. Another major application of digital
systems is for digital ﬁlter design. Here we wish to design digital ﬁlters
with certain desirable characteristics. We can ﬁnd the characteristics of
digital systems by solving difference equations. We give a method of
solution of simple difference equations. More frequently, z-transforms
are used and these are discussed in the next chapter.
14.2 Modelling
simple systems
Damped forced motion of a spring
A spring of length l has a mass m attached to it and a dashpot damping the
motion. It is subject to a force f (t) forcing the motion (see Figure 14.2).
The input to this system is the forcing function f (t) and the output
is the displacement of the spring from its original length, x. In order to
model this system we make a number of assumptions about its behaviour.
Figure 14.2
Damped forced
motion of a spring.
1.
We assume Newton’s second law, FT = ma where a = m d2x/dt2
and FT is the total force operating on the mass: m is the mass on the
spring.
2.
The spring does not become distorted, that is, it is perfectly elastic.
This means, from Hooke’s Law, that FS = −kx, where x is the
displacement from the original spring length l and k is the spring
constant.
3.
The damping force due to the dashpot is FD = −r dx/dt
TLFeBOOK

348
Differential equations and difference equations
To relate these quantities together we use the fact that the total force
on the mass is made up of the spring force, the damping force, and the
external force FT = FD + FS + f (t).
If we wish to combine these equations to express them using a single
differential equation we simply substitute for FT in terms of x and the
derivatives of x, giving
md2x
dt2 = −r dx
dt −kx + f (t)
⇔
md2x
dt2 + r dx
dt + kx = f (t)
Should we wish to solve the system as a system of ﬁrst order differential
equations then we choose some state variables, usually the displacement
and the velocity. Called these x1 and x2, and asx1 is the displacementx1 =
x and as x2 is the velocity this is the derivative of the displacement giving
x2 = dx1/dt.
As the acceleration is the derivative of the velocity, we can write the
acceleration as the derivative of x2
a = d2x1
dt2 = d
dt
dx1
dt = dx2
dt .
Now FT = ma can be written in terms of x2 as FT = m dx2/dt and the
force due to the dashpot becomes FD = −rx2. So FT = FD + FS + f (t)
gives
mdx2
dt = −rx2 −kx1 + f (t)
⇔
dx2
dt = −k
mx1 −r
mx2 + 1
mf (t).
So the system of equations that represent the system is
dx1
dt = x2
dx2
dt = −k
mx1 −r
mx2 + 1
mf (t).
The ﬁrst equation expresses the fact that x2 is the velocity and the
second equation was obtained by considering the total force on the mass
and using Newton’s second law.
This system of equations may be expressed in matrix form as

we can give the system of equations as a matrix differential equation

The system input is f and the output y = x1.
To write the derivative of a variable when it is clear that it is in respect
to its independent variable we may write x′ (read as ‘x dashed’) or x′′
(read as ‘x double dashed’). In addition, when the independent variable
is time we often write ˙x (read as ‘x dot’) and for the second derivative ¨x
(read as ‘x double dot’). Using this notation we have
˙x = Ax + Bf
as the matrix differential equation.
Figure 14.3
An LRC circuit.
Modelling electrical circuits
We can model an LRC circuit as shown in Figure 14.3 using the following
assumptions:
1.
Kirchoff’s voltage law (KVL): the sum of all the voltage drops around
any closed loop is zero.
2.
The voltage drop vR across a resistor is proportional to the current i
i.e.
vR = Ri
(Ohm’s law)
where the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the
resistor.
3.
The voltage drop across a capacitor is proportional to the electric
charge q on the capacitor
vc = 1
C q
where C is the capacitance and is measured in farads, the charge q
is measured in coulombs.
4.
The voltage drop across an inductor is proportional to the rate of
change of the current i
vL = L di
dt
where L is the inductance, measured in henries.
TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations
Then, from KVL:
Ldi

C = v(t)
Since
i(t) = dq
dt
we have
di
dt = d

dq


= d2q
dt2
So we can write this differential equation in terms of q:
Ld2q
dt2 + R dq
dt + q
C = v(t).
Here, the system input is v and the output is the charge on the capacitor q.
To obtain a differential equation in terms of i we can differentiate the
whole of this equation and use i = dq/dt, giving
Ld2i
dt2 + R di
dt + i
C = dv
dt .
Here the input is dv/dt and the output is i. Notice that L, R, and 1/C are
constants.
Should we wish to solve the system as a system of ﬁrst order differential
equations then we choose some state variables. The general procedure is
to choose capacitor voltages and inductor currents. Hence, we choose
x1 = i
and
x2 = vc = q/C.
We can obtain one equation relating x1 and x2 by using
dq
dt = i

C

Now we use KVL to give the other equation

So the system of equations that give the state variables are

A rotational mechanical system
A rotor of moment of inertia J is supported by a shaft of torsional stiff-
ness k and the motion is damped by a rotational damper of torque c per
unit angular velocity (see Figure 14.4). T is the external torque applied
to the rotor.
Figure 14.4
A damped
rotational system.
The torque due to the rotational spring is proportional to the angle
through which it has been twisted, giving TS = −kθ. The damper pro-
vides a torque of −cω and the total rotational torque of the system is
given by J dω/dt where ω is the angular velocity and J is the moment
of inertial of the rotating body.

Differential equations and difference equations
Initial conditions and boundary values
To solve these equations we also need knowledge of the state of the
system at some moment or moments in time. This is usually given
in terms of the initial displacement and the initial velocity, that is, x
and dx/dt at t = 0. This is then called an initial value problem. If
two values of the displacement are given at different times or if the
velocity and the displacement are given at different times, then the
problem is called a boundary value problem. Boundary value problems
are more difﬁcult to specify correctly to ensure that they determine a
solution.
14.3 Ordinary
differential
equations
An ordinary differential equation is an equation which involves deriva-
tives of y (the dependent variable) as well as functions of y and t.
dy
dt = cos(t)
d2y
dt2 + 9t = 0
t2 d3y
dt3
dy
dt + et = t
are all ordinary differential equations.
The other sort of differential equations, which are introduced in
Chapter 17, are partial differential equations which are used to describe a
dependency on two independent variables and involve partial derivatives
like ∂y/∂t (read as ‘partial dy by dt’).
The order of differential equations
The order of the differential equation is the order of the highest derivative
of y (the dependent variable) in the equation.
R dq
dt + q
C = 3
is ﬁrst order in q.
dθ
dt = sin(θ)
is ﬁrst order in θ.
x′′ + 4t2 = 0
is second order in x.
d3u
dt3 −du
dt + u = 4t4
is third order in u.
The solution of a differential equation
If a function, y = g(t), is a solution to a differential equation in y then if,
in the differential equation, we replace y and by g(t) and all the derivatives
of y by the corresponding derivatives of g(t) then the resulting predicate
should be an identity for t. That is, it should be true for all values of t
where it is deﬁned.
TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations
353
Example 14.1
Show that x = t3 is a solution to the differential equation
dx/dt = 3t2.
Solution
Replace x by t3 in the differential equation gives
d
dt (t3) = 3t2
⇔
3t2 = 3t2
As this is true for all values of t, we have shown that x = t3 is a solution
to dx/dt = 3t2.
Example 14.2
Show that y = t2 −3t + 3.5 is a solution to
y′′ + 3y′ + 2y = 2t2.
Solution
Set y = t2 −3t + 3.5, then differentiating gives
y′ = 2t −3
and differentiating again
y′′ = 2
We substitute these expressions for y and the derivatives of y into
y′′ + 3y′ + 2y = 2t2
so we get
2 + 3(2t −3) + 2(t2 −3t + 3.5) = 2t2
⇔
2 + 6t −9 + 2t2 −6t + 7 = 2t2
⇔
2t2 = 2t2
which is true for all values of t showing that y = t2 −3t + 3.5 is a
solution to y′′ + 3y′ + 2y = 2t2.
A differential equation has many solutions. For instance, the equation
dx/dt = 3t2 has solutions x = t3, x = t3 + 4, x = t3 −5, etc.
These are called particular solutions. A general solution is one which
contains some arbitrary constants and encompasses all possible solutions
to the differential equation. This means that by choosing values of these
arbitrary constants we are able to ﬁnd any of the particular solutions of the
equation. For instance, x = t3 + C is a general solution to dx/dt = 3t2.
Linear differential equations
A linear differential equation can be recognized by its form. It is linear
if the coefﬁcients of y (the dependent variable) and all order derivatives
TLFeBOOK

354
Differential equations and difference equations
of y, are functions of t, or constant terms, only.
dy/dt = 4t
d2y/dt2 = 6t
t dy/dt = 6
ay′′ + by′ + cy = f (t)
3 d2y/dt2 + t2 dy/dt + 6y = t5
are all linear.
(dy/dt)2 + 3 = 12t + y dy/dt −t2
θ′′ + k sin(θ) = 0
u′′ −(1 −u2)u′ + u = 0
are all non-linear.
Linearity and superposition of solutions
The property of linearity is very important. We have applied the term
linear to equations whose graphs are straight lines. However, in an alge-
braic sense the term does not mean that everything represents a straight
line! The property of linearity is deﬁned for an operator, which we shall
call O. A linear operator is one that, when operating on the sum of two
terms gives the same result as operating on the terms and then taking the
sum. This can be expressed as
O(f1 + f2) = O(f1) + O(f2).
The other condition is that
O(af ) = aO(f )
The two conditions can be combined to say that a linear operation
on a linear combination of inputs produces a linear combination of the
outputs. A linear combination of f1 and f2 is af1 + bf2, where a and b
are constants and therefore if an operator, O, is linear then
O(af1 + bf2) = aO(f1) + bO(f2)
Examples of linear operators are:
Matrices
A(x1 + x2) = Ax1 + Ax2 and A(ax) = a(Ax) where a is a number and
A is a matrix and x1, x2, and x are vectors

TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations
355
An example of a non-linear operator is the sine function as
sin(A + B) ̸= sin(A) + sin(B)
For a differential equation the fact that it is linear leads to the fact that
if a solution to the differential equation with input function f1(t) is y1
and a solution to the differential equation with input f2(t) is y2, then
one solution to the equation with an input function af1 + bf2, is ay1 +
by2, where a and b are constants. This result is central to the method of
solving differential equations used in this chapter and also to the Laplace
transform method of the next chapter.
Example 14.3
A differential equation
d2x/dt2 + 9x = f (t)
is found to have a particular solution x = t/9 when f (t) = t and a
particular solution
1
5 sin(2t)
whenf (t) = sin(2t).
Suggest a particular solution when f (t) = t + 5 sin(2t) and check that
your hypothesis is correct.
Solution
As the differential equation is linear, if we sum the input
functions then we should be able to sum the solutions. Hence, a solution to
d2x/dt2 + 9x = t + 5 sin(2t)
should be given by
x = t
9 + 5 × 1
5 sin(2t) = t
9 + sin(2t)
Check:
x = t/9 + sin(2t)
dx/dt = (1/9) + 2 cos(2t)
d2x/dt2 = −4 sin(2t)
Then substituting these into
d2x/dt2 + 9x = t + 5 sin(2t)
gives
−4 sin(2t) + 9((t/9) + sin(2t)) = t + 5 sin(2t)
−4 sin(2t) + t + 9 sin(2t) = t + 5 sin(2t)
which is true for all values of t, showing that
x = (t/9) + sin(2t)
is a solution to
d2x/dt2 + 9x = t + 5 sin(2t).

Differential equations and difference equations
Linear equations with constant
coefﬁcients
A linear equation is said to have constant coefﬁcients if the coefﬁcients
multiplying y and the derivatives of y (the dependent variable) are all
constants, that is, do not involve functions of t.
3 d2y/dt2 + 2 dy/dt + 4y = f (t)
has constant coefﬁcients
t2 d2y/dt2 + 3t dy/dt + 4y = f (t)
does not have constant coefﬁcients as t2 and 3t are functions of time.
Figure 14.5
If a system
is time invariant, then a
time-shifted input yields a
time-shifted output.
Time invariance
A linear differential equation with constant coefﬁcients displays time
invariance. If we use the same input and starting conditions for a system
now or at some later time then the result relative to the initial starting time
will be identical. Another way of expressing this is that if the input is time
shifted then so is the output. This idea is represented in Figure 14.5.
Example 14.4
For the differential equation
d2y/dt2 + 4y = sin(3t)
show that
y = sin(2t) −1
5 sin(3t)
is a solution and ﬁnd a solution for the equation with the same input
function delayed by 1 s, that is, ﬁnd a solution to
d2y/dt2 + 4y = sin(3(t −1))
Solution
First, we check that
y = sin(2t) −1
5 sin(3t)
is a solution to the differential equation.
To do this, we must ﬁnd the ﬁrst and second derivatives
dy/dt = 2 cos(2t) −(3/5) cos(3t)
d2y/dt2 = −4 sin(2t) + (9/5) sin(3t)
Substitute into
d2y/dt2 + 4y = sin(3t)
giving
−4 sin(2t) + (9/5) sin(3t) + 4(sin(2t) −1
5 sin(3t)) = sin(3t)
⇔
sin(3t) = sin(3t)
which is true for all t. Hence,
y = sin(2t) −1
5 sin(3t)
is a solution to
d2y/dt2 + 4y = sin(3t).
TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations
357
To ﬁnd a solution to d2y/dt2 +4y = sin(3(t −1)), we use the property
of time invariance, which means that a solution should be given by a
time-shifted version of the solution to the ﬁrst equation, that is
y = sin(2(t −1)) −1
5 sin(3(t −1))
then
dy/dt = 2 cos(2(t −1)) −(3/5) cos(3(t −1))
d2y/dt2 = −4 sin(2(t −1)) + (9/5) sin(3(t −1)).
Substitute into
d2y/dt2 + 4y = sin(3(t −1))
giving
−4 sin(2(t −1)) + (9/5) sin(3(t −1))
+ 4(sin(2(t −1)) −(1/5) sin(3(t −1)))
= sin(3(t −1))
⇔
sin(3(t −1)) = sin(3(t −1))
which is true for all t.
Example 14.5
For the differential equation
t dy/dt + y = 6t2
(a)
show that y = 2t2 is a solution
(b)
show that the equation t dy/dt + y = 6t2 cannot represent a time
invariant system.
Solution
(a) To show that y = 2t2 is a solution to
t dy/dt + y = 6t2
we need to ﬁnd dy/dt
y = 2t2
⇒dy/dt = 4t
substituting into
t dy/dt + y = 6t2
gives
t(4t) + 2t2 = 6t2
⇔
6t2 = 6t2, which is true for all t.
(b) To show that this cannot represent a time-invariant system, we take
an equation with a time-shifted input, for instance, shifted by 2 s to give
t dy/dt + y = 6(t −2)2.
If it were to be time-invariant, then a solution to this equation would
be a time-shifted solution of the solution to the equation in part (a), that
TLFeBOOK

358
Differential equations and difference equations
is, y = 2(t −2)2. To show that the equation does not represent a time-
invariant system we just need to show that y = 2(t −2)2 is not a solution
y = 2(t −2)2
⇒dy/dt = 4(t −2)
Substitution into
t dy/dt + y = 6(t −2)2
gives
t(4(t −2)) + 2(t −2)2 = 6(t −2)2
⇔
4t(t −2) + 2(t −2)2 −6(t −2)2 = 0
⇔
(t −2)(4t + 2t(t −2) −6(t −2)) = 0
⇔
(t −2)(4t + 2t −4 −6t + 12) = 0
⇔
8(t −2) = 0
which is not true for all values of t, showing that y = 2(t −2)2 is not a
solution to t dy/dt + y = 6(t −2)2 and therefore we have shown that
t dy/dt + y = f (t) does not represent a time-invariant system.
We have seen that linear differential equations with constant coefﬁ-
cients represent linear time invariant (LTI) systems.
14.4 Solving
ﬁrst-order LTI
systems
To solve ay′ + by = f (t), we begin by ignoring the forcing function
setting it equal to 0. This is then called the homogeneous equation
ay′ + by = 0.
The general solution to this equation is called the complementary
function.
We then ﬁnd any particular solution and the sum of the complemen-
tary function and the particular solution gives us the general solution to
the differential equation. Summing the two solutions in this way we are
making use of the linearity property of the differential equation.
It may seem strange that a system with no input, as represented
by the homogeneous equation ay′ + by = 0 may have a non-zero
output! This is due to the fact that the initial conditions may be non-
zero. For instance, a pendulum released from rest and performing small
oscillations, approximately obeys the differential equation
d2y/dt2 + ω2y = 0
where y is the distance the tip of pendulum has moved from its rest
position and ω is its angular velocity. The pendulum will only begin to
move if either it is given a non-zero initial velocity of if it is lifted slightly
and then released. This means that either the initial position or the initial
velocity or both must be non-zero for y to be non-zero.
The method we shall use for solving the complementary function relies
on the fact that we know that y′ = ky has the solution y = C ekt. That
is, the derivative of an exponential function is a scaled version of the
original function. This was discussed in Chapter 8. We can also show
TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations
359
that any order derivative of an exponential function is a scaled version of
the original function. Consider
dy/dt = ky.
Differentiating this equation gives
d2y/dt2 = k dy/dt.
Substituting dy/dt = ky we get
d2y/dt2 = k2y
and hence the second derivative is a scaled version of the original
exponential function with scaling factor k2. Differentiating again, we get
d3y/dt3 = k2dy/dt
and on substituting dy/dt = ky, we get
d3y/dt3 = k3y
and hence the third derivative is a scaled version of the original function
with scaling factor k3. We use this property of exponential functions to
solve the homogeneous equation by trying a solution of the form y =
C eλt. We then ﬁnd value(s) for λ which are appropriate for the equation
under consideration.
The equations we found in Section 14.2 were all second-order equa-
tions or systems of equations involving more than one state variable.
However, in some circumstances, we get simple ﬁrst order equations. For
instance if their is no inductor present in an LRC circuit we can put L = 0
to give
R dq/dt + q/C = v(t),
which is ﬁrst order in q.
The method of solution can be characterized by four steps. To ﬁnd the
solution to ay′ + by = f (t):
Step 1: Find the complementary function
The solution of the homogeneous equation
ay′ + by = 0
is found by assuming a solution of the form y = A eλt. Hence, y′ =
Aλ eλt and substituting into ay′ + by = 0 we get
aAλ eλt + bA eλt = 0
We are not interested in the trivial solution A = 0 and eλt is never zero,
so we can divide through by A eλt giving
λa + b = 0
which is called the auxiliary, or characteristic equation.
The auxiliary equation has the solution λ = −b/a. Hence, the comple-
mentary function is
y = A e−(b/a)t.

The system output, after the effect of any initial conditions have died
out, we would expect to mimic the system input. To ﬁnd a particular
solutionwetryatrialsolutionwithsomeundeterminedcoefﬁcients. Some
good guesses to use for the trial solution, depending on the type of input
function f (t), are given in Table 14.1.
The coefﬁcients in the trial solution are determined by substituting into
ay′ + by = f (t).
These trial solutions will not always work. Laplace transforms may be
used to ﬁnd a particular solution in that case (see Chapter 15).
Step 3: Find the general solution
The general solution to the equation is given by the sum of the
complementary function plus the particular solution.
Step 4: Find the particular solution
The ﬁnal step is to use the initial condition to ﬁnd the appropriate value
of A, the arbitrary constant. This solution is then the particular solution
which solves the differential equation with the given initial condition.
Example 14.6
The RC circuit in Figure 14.6 is initially relaxed and is
closed at time t = 0. Hence, applying a DC voltage of v0 the charge of
the capacitor obeys the differential equation
R dq/dt + q/C = v0.
Solve for q and ﬁnd an expression for the voltage across the capacitor at
a time t after the circuit was closed.
Figure 14.6
An RC circuit
with an applied DC voltage.
Step 1
To ﬁnd the complementary function we solve the homogeneous equation
R dq/dt + q/C = 0.
Substitute q = A eλt and dq/dt = Aλ eλt to give
RλA eλt + A eλt/C = 0.
Divide by A eλt
Rλ + 1/C = 0
⇔
λ = −1/(RC).
TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations
361
The complementary function is
q = A e−t/RC
Step 2
Try a particular solution of the form q = a, where a is a constant. Then
q′ = 0, substituting into
R dq/dt + q/C = v0
we get
a/C = v0
⇔
a = v0C
Step 3
The general solution is therefore the sum of the complementary function
(found in Step 1) and a particular solution (found from Step 2), so the
general solution for q is given by
q = A e−t/RC + Cv0
Step 4
Finally, we use the initial conditions to ﬁnd the arbitrary constant A. We
are told that initially the circuit was relaxed meaning that all voltages
and currents are zero. In this case, this means that when t = 0, q = 0.
Substituting this condition into
q = A e−t/RC + Cv0
we get
0 = A + Cv0
⇔
A = −Cv0
Therefore, the solution is
q = −Cv0 e−t/RC + Cv0
⇔
q = Cv0(1 −e−t/RC).
This gives the voltage across the capacitor vc = q/C as vc = v0×
(1 −e−t/RC) where v0 is the applied DC voltage.
Check:
To check that q = Cv0(1 −e−t/RC) is in fact a solution to
R dq/dt + q/C = v0
we carry out the following steps:
q = Cv0(1 −e−t/RC)
⇒dq/dt = (Cv0/RC)e−t/RC
⇔
dq/dt = (v0/R)e−t/RC
Substituting into
R dq/dt + q/C = v0
gives
(Rv0/R)e−t/RC + (v0C/C)(1 −e−t/RC) = v0
⇔
v0 = v0
which is an identity for t, showing that q = Cv0(1−e−t/RC) is a solution
to the differential equation.
TLFeBOOK

362
Differential equations and difference equations
We also check that the solution satisﬁes the given initial condition by
substituting q = 0 and t = 0 into q = Cv0(1 −e−t/RC). We ﬁnd
0 = Cv0(1 −1)
⇔
0 = 0,
which is true.
Example 14.7
Solve the differential equation
y′ −3y = 6 cos(2t),
given y(0) = 2.
Step 1
To ﬁnd the complementary function we solve the homogeneous equation
y′ −3y = 0
substitute y = A eλt so that dy = Aλ eλt, giving
Aλ eλt −3A eλt = 0.
Therefore, we get the auxiliary equation
λ −3 = 0
⇔
λ = 3.
The complementary function is y = A e3t
Step 2
Try a particular solution (chosen from Table 14.1) of the form y =
c cos(2t) + d sin(2t) then y′ = −2c sin(2t) + 2d cos(2t). Substituting
into y′ −3y = 6 cos(2t) we get
−2c sin(2t) + 2d cos(2t) −3(c cos(2t) + d sin(2t)) = 6 cos(2t)
⇔
(−2c −3d) sin(2t) + (2d −3c) cos(2t) = 6 cos(2t).
We want this to be true for all values of t, so we can equate the coefﬁcients
of the sin(2t) terms on both sides of the equation and also the cos(2t)
terms.
Equating the coefﬁcients of sin(2t) gives:
−2c −3d = 0.
Equating the coefﬁcients cos(2t) gives:
−2d −3c = 6.
Therefore,
−2c −3d = 0
−3c + 2d = 6.
Solving these equations simultaneously gives
c = −18/13
d = 12/13.
Hence, a particular solution is
y = −(18/13) cos(2t) + (12/13) sin(2t).
TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations
363
Step 3
The general solution is given by the sum of the complementary function
and a particular solution giving
y = A e3t −(18/13) cos(2t) + (12/13) sin(2t).
Step 4
Use the initial condition to ﬁnd A.
When t = 0, y = 2. Substituting this into
y = A e3t −(18/13) cos(2t) + (12/13) sin(2t)
gives
2 = A −(18/13) cos(0) + (12/13) sin(0)
⇔
2 = A −18/13
⇔
A = 44/13.
Therefore, the solution is
y = (44/13)e3t −(18/13) cos(2t) + (12/13) sin(2t).
Check: Substitute
y = (44/13)e3t −(18/13) cos(2t) + (12/13) sin(2t)
and
y′ = (132/13)e3t + (36/13) sin(2t) + (24/13) cos(2t)
into
y′ −3y = 6 cos(2t) giving
(132/13)e3t + (36/13) sin(2t) + (24/13) cos(2t)
−3(44/13)e3t −(18/13) cos(2t) + (12/13) sin(2t) = 6 cos(2t)
⇔
(78/13) cos(2t) = 6 cos(2t)
which is correct.
We also check the initial condition by substituting t = 0, y = 2 into
y = (44/13)e3t −(18/13) cos(2t) + (12/13) sin(2t).
We ﬁnd
2 = (44/13)e0 −(18/13) cos(0) + (12/13) sin(0)
⇔
2 = (44/13) −(18/13)
⇔
2 = 26/13, which is true.
14.5 Solution of
a second-order
LTI systems
We can solve a second-order system in a manner similar to ﬁrst-order
systems. To solve ay′′ + by′ + cy = f (t) we solve the homogeneous
equation
ay′′ + by′ + cy = 0.
The solution to this equation is called the complementary function.
TLFeBOOK

364
Differential equations and difference equations
We then ﬁnd any particular solution and the sum of the complementary
function and a particular solution gives us the general solution to the
differential equation. We can again list the steps involved.
To solve ay′′ + by′ + cy = f (t)
Step 1 – Find the complementary function
The solution of the homogeneous equation
ay′′ + by′ + cy = 0
is found by assuming solutions of the form y = A eλt.
Hence, y′ = Aλ eλt and y′′ = Aλ2 eλt and we ﬁnd
aAλ2 et + bAλ eλt + cA eλt = 0
giving the auxiliary equation
aλ2 + λb + c = 0.
The auxiliary equation is a quadratic equation. It has solutions
λ1, λ2 = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
.
There are three possible types of solutions:
Case (1): λ1 and λ2 are real and distinct then the solution is:
y = A eλ1t + B eλ2t.
Case (2): λ1 and λ2 are complex. We set λ1 = k +jω0 and λ2 = k −jω0
so that k = −b/2a and
ω0 =
√
4ac −b2
2a
.
Then the complex exponentials can be written in terms of cosines and
sines and the solution becomes
y = ekt(A cos(ω0t) + B sin(ω0t)).
Case (3): The roots are equal, that is, λ1 = λ2 = k = −b/2a, then the
solution is y = (At + B)ekt.
Step 2: Find a particular solution
The particular solution is any solution of the equation
ay′′ + by′ + cy = f (t).
As for the ﬁrst-order system we expect the system output, after the effect
of any initial conditions have died out, to mimic the system input. Again
to ﬁnd a particular solution we try a trial solution as given in Table 14.1.
The ‘guess’ at the particular solution is substituted into the differential
equation and the unknowns coefﬁcients can be determined. If this guess
does not produce a solution then Laplace transform methods can be used
as in Chapter 15.
Step 3
The general solution to the equation is given by the sum of the
complementary function plus a particular solution.
Step 4
The ﬁnal stage is to use the initial conditions or boundary conditions to
ﬁnd the appropriate values of the arbitrary constants A and B.

Example14.8
Solvethedifferentialequation5y′′+6y′+5y = 6 cos(t),
where y(0) = 0 and y′(0) = 0.
Step 1
To ﬁnd the complementary function we solve the homogeneous equation
5y′′ + 6y′ + 5y = 0. Trying solutions of the form y = A eλt leads to the
auxiliary equation 5λ2 + 6λ + 5 = 0. Notice that a quick way to get
the auxiliary equation is to ‘replace’ y′′ by λ2, y′ by λ, and y by 1. The
auxiliary equation has solutions
λ = −6 ±
√

= −0.6 ± j0.8.
Comparing this with λ = k ± jω0 gives k = −0.6, ω0 = 0.8. This means
that the complementary function has the form
y = ekt(A cos(ω0t) + B sin(ω0t))
(given as Case (2) in the general method), with k = −0.6 and ω0 = 0.8.
This gives
y = e−0.6t(A cos(0.8t) + B sin(0.8t)).
Step 2
As f (t) = 6 cos(t), from Table 14.1 we decide to try a particular solution
of the form y = c cos(t) + d sin(t). Then
y′ = −c sin(t) + d cos(t)
and
y′′ = −c cos(t) −d sin(t).
Substituting in
5y′′ + 6y′ + 5y = 6 cos(t)
we ﬁnd
5(−c cos(t) −d sin(t)) + 6(−c sin(t) + d cos(t))
+ 5(c cos(t) + d sin(t)) = 6 cos(t)
⇔
(−5c + 6d + 5c) cos(t) + (−5d −6c + 5d) sin(t) = 6 cos(t)
⇔
6d cos(t) −6c sin(t) = 6 cos(t).
As we want this to be an identity we equate the coefﬁcients of cos(t) and
the coefﬁcients of sin(t) and get the two equations
6d = 6
⇔
d = 1
6c = 0
⇔
c = 0.
Hence, a particular solution is y = sin(t).
TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations
Step 3
The general solution is given by the sum of the complementary function
and a particular solution, so
y = e−0.6t(A sin(0.8t) + B cos(0.8t)) + sin(t).
Step 4
Use the given initial conditions to ﬁnd values for the constants A and B.
Substituting y = 0 when t = 0 into
y = e−0.6t(A cos(0.8t) + B sin(0.8t)) + sin(t)
then
0 = e0(A cos(0) + B sin(0)) + sin(0)
⇔
0 = A.
To use the other condition, that y′ = 0 when t = 0, we need to differ-
entiate the general solution to ﬁnd an expression for y′. Differentiating
(using the product rule):
y = e−0.6t(A cos(0.8t) + B sin(0.8t)) + sin(t)
⇒y′ = −0.6 e−0.6t(A cos(0.8t) + B sin(0.8t))
+ e−0.6t(−0.8A sin(0.8t) + 0.8B cos(0.8t)) + cos(t)
and using y′ = 0 when t = 0 gives
0 = −0.6A + 0.8B + 1.
We have already found A = 0 from the ﬁrst condition, so
B = −1/(0.8) = −1.25.
Therefore, the solution is
y = −1.25 e−0.6t sin(0.8t) + sin(t).
Check
y = −1.25 e−0.6t sin(0.8t) + sin(t)
y′ = 0.75 e−0.6t sin(0.8t) −e−0.6t cos(0.8t) + cos(t)
y′′ = −0.45 e−0.6t sin(0.8t) + 0.6 e−0.6t cos(0.8t)
+ 0.6 e−0.6t cos(0.8t) + 0.8 e−0.6t sin(0.8t) −sin(t).
Substitute into
5y′′ + 6y′ + 5y = 6 cos(t)
giving
5(−0.45 e−0.6t sin(0.8t) + 0.6 e−0.6t cos(0.8t)
+ 0.6 e−0.6t cos(0.8t) + 0.8 e−0.6t sin(0.8t) −sin(t))
+ 6(0.75 e−0.6t sin(0.8t) −e−0.6t cos(0.8t) + cos(t))
+ 5(−1.25 e−0.6t sin(0.8t) + sin(t)) = 6 cos(t)
⇔
e−0.6t sin(0.8t)(1.75 + 4.5 −6.25) + e−0.6t cos(0.8t)(6 −6)
+ sin(t)(−5 + 5) + 6 cos(t) = 6 cos(t)
which is true for all values of t.
We can also check that the solution satisﬁes the given initial conditions.

Solve the homogeneous equation
(4 × 10−6)d2i/dt2 + 5 di/dt + 106i = 0

Find a particular solution. As the forcing function is a cosine function we

di/dt = −10c sin(10t) + 10d cos(10t)
= −100c cos(10t) −100d sin(10t).
Substituting into
(4 × 10−6)d2i/dt2 + 5 di/dt + 106i = 200 cos(10t)
we get

gives
−0.0004c + 50d + 106c = 200
−0.0004d −50c + 106d = 0
and solving these equations we ﬁnd d ≈10−8 and c ≈0.0002, so
i = 0.0002 cos(10t) + 10−8 sin(10t).
Step 3
Hence, the general solution is
i = A e−106t + B e−4×106t + 0.0002 cos(10t) + 10−8 sin(10t).
Step 4
Given than i = 0 and di/dt = 0 when t = 0 initially, then we can

A + B = −0.0002
which we solve to ﬁnd A ≈−0.000267 and B = 0.0000667.
So, the solution to the initial value problem is approximately
i = −0.000267 e−106t + 0.0000667 e−4×106t

The transient and steady state
solution – system stability
From the systems modelled in Section 14.2 we can see that the term by′
in the equation:
ay′′ + by′ + cy = f (t)
comes from the damping factor in the system. For electrical systems this
is provided by the resistance. b must be a positive quantity in any of those
systems as are the other coefﬁcients.
The auxiliary equation is aλ2 + bλ + c = 0 with solutions
λ1, λ2 = −b ±

and this gives three possibilities for the complementary function.
TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations

Case (1):
Real distinct roots y = A eλ1t +B eλ2t. Notice that λ1 λ2 must
be negative when a, b, and c are positive and therefore the
complementary function will die out as t →∞. In this case
the system is said to be overdamped.
Case (2):
Complex roots y = ekt(A cos(ω0t) + B sin(ω0t))
where k = −b/2a which is negative, so ekt is a negative
exponential term. This then represents dying oscillations. The
system is said to be underdamped.
Case (3):
The roots are equal, then = k = −b/2a and y = (At +B)ekt
Again this has a negative exponential part causing the com-
plementary function to tend to zero as t →∞. This case is
referred to as critical damping.
Because the contribution from the complementary function dies out as
t →∞, it is referred to as the transient solution. Graphs of the form of
the transients, for positive initial displacement and zero initial velocity,
are shown in Figures 14.7(a)–(c) for Cases (1)–(3) respectively.

Differential equations and difference equations
The other part of the solution, where we consider the effect of the
forcing function, is called the steady state solution. For the solution found
in Example 14.8 where
y = −1.25 e−0.6t sin(0.8t) + sin(t)
we ﬁnd that −1.25 e−0.6t sin(0.8t) is the transient and sin(t) is the steady
state solution. If we consider the system after some time has passes then
the transient will effectively be zero and we are left with y = sin(t), the
steady state solution.
We have said that in any truly linear system, as represented, for
instance, by our models in Section 14.2, the constants must be posi-
tive with positive damping. However, we may wish to analyse non-linear
systems by using a locally linear approximation. In this situation they
may exhibit unstable behaviour, where the ‘transients’, instead of dying
out, display positive exponential behaviour and grow very large. This is
then referred to as an unstable system.
We can analyse systems in the following way:
Stable system:A system is stable if all the solutions to the auxiliary equa-
tion have negative real parts. A system with some purely imaginary
solutions to the auxiliary equation can also considered to be stable
although the complementary function does not die out as t →∞but
represents sustained oscillations.
Unstable system:A system is unstable if any solutions to the auxiliary
equation have positive real parts or, for systems of higher order, if
there is a repeated, purely imaginary, solution.
Damped oscillations of a mechanical
system – resonance
For damped oscillations of a spring we have the differential equation
⇔
m d2x/dt2 + r dx/dt + kx = f (t)
as shown in Section 14.2, where m is the mass, r the damping constant,
and k the spring constant. We shall look at the steady state solution in
the case where there is a single frequency input. We are interested in the
magnitude of the response in this case in order to analyse the problem of
resonance.
For simplicity we can regard the single frequency input as a complex
exponential f (t) = F0 ejωt where F0 is a constant. Having found the
response to the complex exponential, then as
F0 ejωt = F0 cos(ωt) + jF0 sin(ωt)
we can ﬁnd the response to a cosine function by taking the real part of
the output or to a sine function by taking the imaginary part of the output
(this is an application of the linearity property).
We have the equation m¨x + r ˙x + kx = F0 ejωt and we want to ﬁnd the
steady state solution. Try a solution of the form x = c ejωt then
˙x = cjω ejωt
¨x = −cω2 ejωt
and substituting into the differential equation we ﬁnd
−mcω2 ejωt + crjω ejωt + kc ejωt = F0 ejωt.
TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations
371
On dividing both sides by ejωt (which is non-zero), we get
c(−mω2 + jrω + k) = F0.
Hence
c = F0/(−mω2 + jrω + k)
giving the steady state solution as
x =
F0 ejωt
−mω2 + jrω + k
We are interested in the magnitude of the oscillations, which is given by

F0
−mω2 + jrω + k
 .
We can ﬁnd this by taking the magnitude of the top and bottom lines.
From Chapter 14 we know that the magnitude of a complex number,
z = x + jy, is given by r =

x2 + y2. Hence, we ﬁnd the amplitude
of the oscillations in response to a single frequency of input of angular
frequency is given by
F0

(mω2 −k)2 + r2ω2 .
This was plotted in Figure 11.10 for the case m = k = 1 and various
values of r (there called c). If the damping, r, is quite small then we can
set it to be effectively 0. In this case
|x| =



F0
k −ω2m
for ω2 < k/m
F0
ω2m −k
for ω2 > k/m
In which case there is an inﬁnite discontinuity at
ω =

k
m.
We see that √k/m represents the natural angular frequencies of m the
system in the case where r is 0. We can show this by examining the
solution to the homogeneous in the case where r = 0.
mx′′ + kx = 0 has auxiliary equation
mλ2 + k = 0
⇔
λ2 = −k/m
and setting λ = jω0 we ﬁnd that ω2
0 = k/m and the complementary
function x = A cos(ω0t) + B sin(ω0t).
We can see from this limiting case that if the damping constant is
small and the oscillations of the forcing function are near to the natu-
ral oscillations of the underdamped system then we have a situation of
resonance where the magnitude of the response can become very large.
This effect has led to the destruction of some physical systems before the
phenomenon of resonance was well understood.

systems of
differential
equations
To solve a system of differential equations we can combine the equations
into a single differential equation using substitution. In this case we can
use the method as outlined in Section 14.5. Alternatively, we can solve
the system directly using matrices.
We follow the same pattern as in Section 14.4 for ﬁrst-order systems.
We solve the homogeneous equation, to ﬁnd the complementary function
and then ﬁnd a particular solution. The sum of these two terms gives a
general solution to the system.

Differential equations and difference equations
14.7 Difference
equations
Discrete systems are designed using digital adders, multipliers, and shift
registers and are represented mathematically by difference equations.
Difference equations are used in the design of digital ﬁlters and also
to approximately model continuous systems.
The system has an input which is a sequence of values f0, f1, f2, . . .
and the output is a sequence y0, y1, y2, . . . If yn depends solely on the
values of the input, then
yn = b0fn + b1fn−1 + b2fn−2 + · · · .
This is a non-recursive system as we do not need previous knowledge
of y to determine yn. It is called a ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) system
(the meaning of ‘impulse response’ will be explained in Chapter 15).
If, however, the output y depends on the previous state of the system
as well as the input then we have a recursive system, modelled by a
difference equation (also called a recurrence relation). This is called a
inﬁnite impulse response (IIR) system.
We shall look at linear time-invariant discrete systems. We shall
consider the solution of a second order difference equation
ayn + byn−1 + cyn−2 = fn.
The method of solution, as for differential equations, is to solve the
homogeneous system and ﬁnd a particular solution. The sum of these
gives the general solution to the difference equation. We employ the
initial conditions to ﬁnd the value of the arbitrary constants.
Example 14.11
Solve the difference equation (n ⩾2):
6yn −5yn−1 + yn−2 = 1,
y0 = 4.5 and y1 = 2.
Solution
Step 1
Solve the homogeneous difference equation
6yn −5yn−1 + yn−2 = 0.
We know from Chapters 8 and 12 that the yn+1 = ryn deﬁnes a geometric
series yn = arn−1, where a is the ﬁrst term of the sequence and r is the
common ratio. If we start at the zeroth term, then we have yn = a0rn.
We therefore try a solution of this form to the homogeneous equation and
substitute yn = aλn into 6yn −5yn−1 + yn−2 = 0. This gives
6 aλn −5 aλn−1 + aλn−2 = 0.
Assuming that a and λn−2 are non-zero, we can divide by aλn−2 to give
6λ2 −5λ + 1 = 0.
This is called the auxiliary equation and solving this we ﬁnd
λ = 5 ±
√
25 −24

⇔
λ = 1

As in the case of differential equations, there are three possible types

λ1, λ2 = −b ±
√

2a
Case (1): λ1 and λ2 are real and distinct
yn = a(λ1)n + b(λ2)n.
Case (2): λ1 and λ2 are complex. Then we write in exponential form
λ1 = r ejθ so λ2 = r e−jθ and the solution can be expressed as
y = rn(a cos(nθ) + b sin(nθ)).
Case (3): λ1 and λ2 are equal real roots and the solution is yn =
(a + bn)λn.
Step 2
Find a particular solution. We use a trial solution which depends on the
form of the input sequence fn as suggested by Table 14.2.
In this case the input is a constant so we try a constant output. The trial
solution is yn = c. Substituting this into
6yn −5yn−1 + yn−2 = 1
gives the equation for c as
6c −5c + c = 1
⇔
2c = 1
c = 1/2
A particular solution for y is yn = 1/2.

System stability
We can see that the solution, as in the continuous case, is made up of
a transient, in this case, 3(1/3)n + (1/2)n, and a steady state response,
which in this case is 1/2. The transient tends to zero as n →∞. This
will be so for any system as long as the roots to the auxiliary equation
are such that the modulus of λ is less than 1. If the roots have modulus
of exactly 1, then the solution of the homogeneous equation does not die
away as n →0 but neither does it tend to inﬁnity. Therefore, we can
identify a stable system as one with roots of the auxiliary equation such
that |λ| ⩽1.
14.8 Summary
1.
Dynamic physical processes involve variables which are interdepen-
dent and constantly changing. When modelling the system we will
obtain relationships between variables, many of which will be
related through derivatives. We can combine these to make a single
differential equation relating the system input to the system output
or we can choose state variables and express the relationship through
a system of differential equations.
2.
Linear time invariant (LTI) systems are represented by linear differ-
ential equations with constant coefﬁcients. A second-order equation
is of the form
a d2y/dt2 + b dy/dt + cy = f (t)
where f (t) represents the system input and y the system output.
TLFeBOOK

3.
If a function, y = g(t), is a solution to a differential equation in y
then if, in the differential equation, we replace y and by g(t) and
all the derivatives of y by the corresponding derivatives of g(t) then
the result should be an identity for t. That is, it should be true for
all values of t.
4.
To solve linear differential equations with constant coefﬁcients, we
solve the homogeneous equation (with f (t) = 0), thus ﬁnding the
complementary function. This leads to the auxiliary equation which,
for a second-order system is
aλ2 + bλ + c = 0.
This gives three possibilities for the complementary function,
depending on the roots for λ.
λ1, λ2 = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
Case (1):
Real distinct roots: y = A eλ1t + B eλ2t
Case (2):
Complex roots: y = ekt(A cos(ω0t) + B sin(ω0t))
Case (3):
The roots are equal, then λ = k = −b/2a, y = (At +
B)ekt.
We then ﬁnd a particular solution to the equation by using a trial
solution as suggested in Table 14.1. The sum of the complemen-
tary function and a particular solution gives the general solution of
the differential equation. The initial conditions are used to ﬁnd the
arbitrary constants A and B.
5.
For a truly linear system, the complementary function dies out as
t →∞and is called the transient solution, The other part of the
solution, in response to the input f (t), is called the steady state
solution. When analysing a system as locally linear, we say that
the system is unstable if the roots of the complementary function
have a positive real part. In these circumstances, the complementary
function →∞as t →∞. Higher order systems are also unstable
if there is a repeated purely imaginary root.
6.
Resonance occurs when, in an underdamped system, the forcing
frequency approaches the natural frequency of the system.
7.
Systems of differential equations may be solved using a matrix
method.
8.
Discrete systems may be represented by difference equations (also
called recurrence relations). A second-order linear system is rep-
resented by ayn + byn−1 + cyn−2 = fn. To solve this equation
we ﬁnd the solution to the homogeneous system (setting fn = 0),
which leads to the auxiliary equation
aλ2 + bλ + c = 0.
This leads to three possibilities for the complementary function
depending on the roots for λ:
λ1, λ2 = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
Case (1):
λ1 and λ2 are real and distinct.
yn = a(λ1)n + b(λ2)n.
TLFeBOOK

Differential equations and difference equations
Case (2):
λ1 and λ2 are complex. Then we write in exponential
form λ1 = r ejθ so λ2 = r e−jθ and the solution can be
expressed as
y = rn(a cos(nθ) + b sin(nθ)).
Case (3):
λ1 and λ2 are equal real roots and the solution is yn =
(a + bn)λn. The system is stable if |λ| ⩽1.
We then ﬁnd a particular solution by attempting a trial solution,
as suggested in Table 14.2. The general solution of the difference
equation is given by the sum of the complementary function and a
particular solution.

Laplace and
z transforms
15.1
Introduction
In this chapter, we will present a quick review of Laplace transform
methods for continuous and piecewise continuous systems and z trans-
form methods for discrete systems. The widespread application of these
methods means that engineers need increasingly to be able to apply these
techniques in multitudes of situations.
Laplace transforms are used to reduce a differential equation to a simple
equation in s-space and a system of differential equations to a system of
linear equations. We discover that in the case of zero initial conditions,
we can solve the system by multiplying the Laplace transform of the input
function by the transfer function of the system. Furthermore, if we are
only interested in the steady state response, and we have a periodic input,
we can ﬁnd the response by simply adding the response to each of the
frequency components of the input signal. In Chapter 16, we therefore
look at ﬁnding the frequency components of a periodic function by ﬁnding
its Fourier series.
Similar ideas apply to z transform methods applied to difference
equations representing discrete systems.
The system transfer function is the Laplace transform of the impulse
responsefunctionofthesystem. Theimpulseresponseisitsresponsetoan
impulse function also called a delta function. Inputting an impulse func-
tion can be though of as something like giving the system a short kick
to see what happens next. The impulse function is an idealized kick, as
it lasts for no time at all and has energy of exactly 1. Because of these
requirements, we ﬁnd that the delta function is not a function at all, in the
sense that we deﬁned functions in Chapter 1. We ﬁnd that it is the most
famous example of a generalized function.
15.2 The
Laplace
transform –
deﬁnition
The Laplace transform F(s) of the function f (t) deﬁned for t > 0 is
F(s) =
 ∞
0
e−stf (t) dt.
The Laplace transform is a function of s where s is a complex variable.
Because the integral deﬁnition of the Laplace transform involves an inte-
gral to ∞it is usually necessary to limit possible values of s so that the
integral converges (i.e. does not tend to ∞). Also, for many functions the
Laplace transform does not exist at all.
L{ } is the symbolic representation of the process of taking a Laplace
transform (LT). Therefore,
L{f (t)} = F(s).

We employ integration by parts twice until we ﬁnd an expression that
involves the original integral, I. We are then able to express I in terms
of a and s.

15.3 The unit
step function
and the
(impulse) delta
function
The unit step function and delta function are very useful in systems theory.
The unit step function
The unit step function is deﬁned as follows:
u(t) =

1
t ⩾0
0
t < 0
and its graph is as shown in Figure 15.1.
Figure 15.1
The graph of
the unit step function u(t).
The function is used to represent an idealized switch. It switches on at
time t = 0. If it is multiplied by any other function then it acts to switch
that function on at t = 0. That is, the function
f (t)u(t) =

0
t < 0
f (t)
t ⩾0.
An example for f (t) = t2 is given in Figure 15.2.
Figure 15.2
Any function
when multiplied by the unit
step function is ‘switched on’
at t = 0. (a) the function
y = t 2; (b) the function
y = t 2u(t).
As the Laplace transform only involves the integral from t = 0, all
functions can be thought of as multiplied by the unit step function because
f (t) = f (t)u(t) as long as t > 0.
Shifting the unit step function
As we saw in Chapter 2, the graph of f (t −a) can be found by taking
the graph of f (t) and moving it a units to the right. There is an example
of a shifted unit step function in Figure 15.3.
Notice that the unit step function ‘switches on’ where the argument
of u is zero. Multiplying any function by the shifted unit step function
changes where it is switched on. That is
f (t)u(t −a) =

0
t < a
f (t)
t ⩾a.
The example of sin(t)u(t −1) is shown in Figure 15.4.
The delta function
The impulse function, or delta function, is a mathematical representation
of a kick. It is an idealized kick that lasts for no time at all and has energy
of exactly 1.
Figure 15.3
(a) The graph
of y = u(t). (b) The graph of
y = u(t −2) is found by

t < 1 and equal to sin(ωt) for t > 1.
Figure 15.5
The sequence
of rectangular pulse functions
of area 1. Starting from a
pulse of height 1 and width 1
we double the height and half
the width.
The delta function, δ(t), is an example of a generalized function. A
generalized function can be deﬁned in terms of a sequence of functions.
One way of deﬁning it is as the limit of a rectangular pulse function,
with area 1, as it halves in width and doubles in height. This sequence
of functions is shown in Figure 15.5. Although the height of the pulse is
tending to inﬁnity, the area of the pulse remains 1.
Two important properties of the delta function are
1.
δ(t −a) = 0 for t ̸= a,
2.
 ∞
−∞δ(t) = 1.
The second property expresses the fact that the area enclosed by the delta
function is 1.
The unit step function, u(t), has no derivative at t = 0. Because of the
sharp edges present in its graph and its jump discontinuity it is impossible
to deﬁne a single tangent at that point. However, if we also consider the
unit step function as a generalized function (by taking the limit of nice
smooth, continuous curves as they approach the shape of the unit step
function), we are able to deﬁne its derivative, which turns out to be the
delta function. This gives the third deﬁnition
3.
du/dt = δ(t).
TLFeBOOK

386
Laplace and z transforms
Symbolic representation of δ(t)
δ(t) can be represented on a graph by an arrow of height 1. The height rep-
resents the weight of the delta function. A shifted delta function, δ(t −a),
is represented by an arrow at t = a. Examples are given in Figure 15.6.
15.4 Laplace
transforms of
simple
functions and
properties of
the transform
Rather than ﬁnding a Laplace transform from the deﬁnition we usually use
tables of Laplace transforms. A list of some common Laplace transforms
is given in Table 15.1. We can then use the properties of the transform
to ﬁnd Laplace transforms of many other functions. To ﬁnd the inverse
transform, represented by L−1{ } we use the same table backwards. That
is, look for the function of s on the right-hand column; the left-hand
column then gives its inverse:
F(s) =
 ∞
0

Using partial fractions to ﬁnd the
inverse transform
Partial fractions can be used to ﬁnd the inverse transform of expressions
like
11s + 7
s2 −1
by expressing F(s) as a sum of fractions with a simple factor in the
denominator.
Example 15.15
Find the inverse Laplace transform of
11s + 7
s2 −1
Solution
Factorize the denominator. This is equivalent to ﬁnding the
values of s for which the denominator is 0, because if the denominator
has factors s1 and s2 we know that we can write it as c(s −s1)(s −s2)
where c, is some number. In this case we could solve for s2 −1 = 0.
However, it is not difﬁcult to spot that s2 −1 = (s −1)(s +1). The values
for which the denominator is zero are called the poles of the function.
11s + 7
s2 −1 =
11s + 7
(s −1)(s + 1).
We assume that there is an identity such that
11s + 7
(s2 −1) =
A
s −1 +
B
s + 1.
Multiply both sides of the equation by (s −1)(s + 1) to get
11s + 7 = A(s + 1) + B(s −1).

A quick formula for partial fractions
There is a quick way of getting the partial fractions expansion, called
the ‘cover up’ rule, which works in the case where all the roots of the
denominator of F(s) are distinct. If F(s) = P(s)/Q(s) then write Q(s)
in terms of its factors Q(s)
Q(s) = c(s −s1)(s −s2)(s −s3) · · · (s −sr) · · · (s −sn)
where s1 . . . sn are its distinct roots. Then we can ﬁnd the constant Ar,
etc., for the partial fraction expansion from covering up each of the factors
of Q in term and substituting s = sr in the rest of the expression:
F(s) =
P(s)
c(s −s1)(s −s2)(s −s3) · · · (s −sr) · · · (s −sn)
then
F(s) =
A1
(s −s1) +
A2
(s −s2) + · · · +
Ar
(s −sr) + · · · +
An
(s −sn)
where
✘✘✘
Ar =
P(sr)
c(sr −s1)(sr −s2)(sr −s3) · · · (sr −sr) · · · (sr −sn)
In this case
F(s) = 11s + 7
s2 −1 =
11s + 7
(s −1)(s + 1) =
A
s −1 +
B
s + 1
Then A is found by substituting s = 1 into
✘✘
11s + 7
(s −1)(s + 1) = 11 + 7
2
= 9
and B is found by substituting s = −1 into
✘✘
11s + 7
(s −1)(s + 1) = −11 + 7
−2
= 2.
This gives the partial fraction expansion, as before, as
F(s) =
9
s + 1 +
2
s −1.
This method can also be used for complex poles; for instance,
1
(s2 + 4)(s + 3) =
1
(s + 3)(s −j2)(s + j2).
TLFeBOOK

394
Laplace and z transforms
The roots of the denominator are −3, j2 and −j2, so we get for the partial
fraction expansion

1
13(s + 3) +
1
(−8 + j12)(s −j2)
+
1
(−8 −j12)(s + j2).
The inverse transform can be found directly or the last two terms can be
combined to give the expansion as
1
(s2 + 4)(s + 3) =
1
13(s + 3)+ −16s + 48
208(s2 + 4) =
1
13(s + 3)+
3 −s
13(s2 + 4).
Repeated poles
If there are repeated factors in the denominator, for example,
4
(s + 1)2(s −2)
then try a partial fraction expansion of the form
4
(s + 1)2(s −2) =
A
(s + 1)2 +
B
s + 1 +
C
s −2.
The ‘cover up’ rule cannot be used to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients A and B.

15.6 Laplace
transforms and
systems theory
The transfer function and impulse
response function
An important role is played in systems theory by the impulse response
function, the Laplace transform of which is called the Transfer Func-
tion (or system function). We remember from Chapter 14 that a linear,
time-invariant system is represented by a linear differential equation with
constant coefﬁcients. We will stick to second-order equations although
the results can be generalized to any order.
An LTI system can be represented by
a d2y
dt2 + bdy
dt + cy = f (t).
If we take f (t) as the delta function δ(t), then we get
a d2y
dt2 + bdy
dt + cy = δ(t).
By deﬁnition of the impulse response function we consider all initial
conditions to be 0.
Taking the Laplace transform we get
as2Y(s) + bsY(s) + cY(s) = 1
Y(s)(as2 + bs + c) = 1
Y(s) =
1
as2 + bs + c.
Noticethatthepolesofthisfunctionarefoundbysolving as2+bs+c = 0,
which we recognize as the auxiliary equation or characteristic equation
from Chapter 14.
This function, the Laplace transform of the impulse response function,
is called the transfer function and is usually denoted by H(s), so we have
H(s) =
1
as2 + bs + c
and L{H(s)} = h(t), where h(t) is the impulse response function.
Note that the impulse response function describes the behaviour of the
system after it has been given an idealized kick.
Example 15.18
Find the transfer function and impulse response of the
system described by the following differential equation:
3dy
dt + 4y = f (t).
Solution
To ﬁnd the transfer function replace f (t) by δ(t) and take
the Laplace transform of the resulting equation assuming zero initial
TLFeBOOK

398
Laplace and z transforms
conditions:
3dy
dt + 4y = δ(t).
Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation we get
3(sY −y(0)) + 4Y = 1
As y(0) = 0,
Y =
1
3s + 4 = H(s).
To ﬁnd the impulse response function we take the inverse transform of
the transfer function to ﬁnd
h(t) = L−1

1
3s + 4
	
= e
−4t
3 .
We now discover that we can ﬁnd the system response to any input func-
tion f (t), with zero initial conditions, by using the transfer function.
Response of a system with zero initial
conditions to any input f (t)
Assuming all initial conditions are zero, that is, y′(0) = 0 and y(0) = 0,
then the equation
a d2y
dt2 + bdy
dt + cy = f (t)
transforms to become
(as2 + bs + c)Y(s) = F(s) ⇔Y(s) =
F(s)
as2 + bs + c.
We have just discovered that the transfer function, H(s), is given by
H(s) =
1
as2 + bs + c.
Then we ﬁnd that
Y(s) = F(s)H(s).
In order to ﬁnd the response of the system to the function f (t) we take the
inverse transform of this expression. We are able to use the convolution
property of Laplace transforms which states:
L
 t
0
f (τ)g(t −τ) dτ
	
= F(s)G(s)
or equivalently
L−1{F(s)G(s)} =
 t
0
f (τ)g(t −τ) dτ.
The integral
 t
0 f (t) g(t −τ) dτ is called the convolution of f and g
and can be expressed as f (t) ∗g(t). So we ﬁnd that the response of the
TLFeBOOK

Laplace and z transforms
399
system with zero initial conditions to any input function f (t) is given by
the convolution of f (t) with the system’s impulse response:
y(t) = L−1{F(s)H(s)} = f (t) ∗h(t).
We can use this result to solve two types of problems, given zero initial
conditions. If we know the impulse response function of the system then
we can ﬁnd the system response to any input f (t) either by convolving in
the time domain y(t) = f (t) ∗h(t) or by ﬁnding the Laplace transform
of f (t), F(s), and ﬁnding the transfer function of the system L{h(t)} =
H(s) and then ﬁnding Y(s) = H(s)F(s) and taking the inverse transform
of this to ﬁnd y(t). This type of problem is called a convolution problem.
The other type of problem is that given any output, y(t), and given the
input, f (t), we can deduce the impulse response of the system. This
we do by ﬁnding F(s) = L{f (t)}, Y(s) = L{y(t)} and then H(s) =
Y(s)/F(s), thus giving the transfer function. To ﬁnd the impulse response
we ﬁnd h(t) = L−1{H(s)}
Example 15.19
The impulse response of a system is known to be h(t) =
e3t. Find the response of the system to an input of f (t) = 6 cos(2t) given
zero initial conditions.
Solution
Method 1. We can take Laplace transforms and use Y(s) =
H(s)F(s). In this case
h(t) = e3t
⇔H(s) = L{e3t} =
1
s −3
f (t) = 6 cos(2t) ⇔F(s) = L{6 cos(2t)} =
6s
4 + s2 .
Hence
Y(s) = H(s)F(s) =
6s
(s −3)(4 + s2).
As we want to ﬁnd y(t), we use partial fractions:
6s
(s −3)(4 + s2) =
6s
(s −3)(s + j2)(s −j2)
=
18
13(s −3) +

(using the ‘cover up’ rule)

=
18
13(s −3) −
18s
13(s2 + 4) + 12
13

(s2 + 4).
We can now take the inverse transform to ﬁnd the system response:
y(t) = L−1{Y(s)}
= L−1

Alternative method. Find y(t) by taking the convolution of f (t) with
the impulse response function

which conﬁrms the result of the ﬁrst method.
Example 15.20
A system at rest has a constant input of f (t) = 3
applied at t = 0. The output is found to be u(t)( 3

Since

we have

3
2(s + 2) = 3s + 6 −3s
2s(s + 2)
=
3
s(s + 2)
and as f (t) = 3, we have
F(s) = 3
s .
Hence
H(s) = Y(s)
F(s) = 3/(s(s + 2))
3/s
=
1

giving
h(t) = L−1

Hence the impulse response is h(t) = e−2t.

The frequency response
In this section, we shall seek to establish a relationship between the trans-
fer function and the steady state response to a single frequency input.
Consider the response of the system
¨y + 3 ˙y + 2y = f (t)
to a single sinusoidal input ej ωt = cos(ωt)+j sin(ωt) with y(0) = 2 and
˙y(0) = 1. Taking Laplace transforms we ﬁnd
s2Y −2s −1 + 3(sY −2) + 2Y =
1
s −jω
Y(s2 + 3s + 2) = 2s + 7 +
1
s −jω
Y =
2s + 7
s2 + 3s + 2 +
1
(s −jω)(s2 + 3s + 2).
Remember
H(s) =
1
s2 + 3s + 2 =
1
(s + 2)(s + 1)
Y =
2s + 7
(s + 2)(s + 1) +
1
(s −jω)(s + 2)(s + 1).
The ﬁrst term in this expression is due to non-zero initial conditions. We
are particularly interested in the second term in the expression for Y(s),
which we notice may be written as H(s)/(s −jω).
Using the ‘cover up’ rule to write Y(s) in its partial fractions,
Y(s) =
5
s + 1 −
3
s + 2 +
1
(−1 −jω)(s + 1) +
1
(2 + jω)(s + 2) + H( jω)
s −jω .
Taking inverse transforms we ﬁnd
y(t) = 5e−t −3e−2t +
1
−1 −jωe−t +
1
2 + jωe−2t + H( jω)ejωt.
The ﬁrst two terms in this expression are caused by the non-zero initial
values and decay exponentially. The next two terms also decay with
increasing t and are as a result of the abrupt turn on of the input at t = 0.
Thus for a stable system, all four terms are part of the transient solution
that dies out as t increases. The ﬁfth and ﬁnal term is the sinusoidal input
f (t) = ejωt multiplied by H( jω). H( jω) is a complex constant. This is
the steady state response of the system to a single sinusoidal input, which
we have shown in this case is given by
Y(t) = H( jω)ejωt.
We can then see that for a single sinusoid input the steady state response
is found by substituting s = jω into the transfer function for the system
and multiplying the resulting complex constant by the sinusoidal input.
In other words, the steady state response is a scaled and phase shifted
TLFeBOOK

Laplace and z transforms
version of the input. We can ﬁnd the response to a sine or cosine input by
y(t) = Re(H( jω)ejωt)
for f (t) = cos(ωt)
and
y(t) = Im(H( jω)ejωt)
for f (t) = sin(ωt)
Alternatively, we can ﬁnd the response to ejωt and to e−jωt and use the
fact that
cos(ωt) = 1
2(ejωt + e−jωt)
sin(ωt) =
1
2j (ejωt −e−jωt)
to write
for f (t) = cos(ωt),
y(t) = 1
2(H( jω)ejωt + H(−jω)e−jωt)
for f (t) = sin(ωt),
y(t) = 1
2j(H( jω)ejωt −H(−jω)e−jωt).
All of these results make use of the principle of superposition for linear
systems.
We have seen in this section that the response to a simple sinusoid can
be characterized by multiplying the input by a complex constant H( jω)
where ω is the angular frequency of the input. The function H( jω) is
called the frequency response function. It is this result that motivates us
towards the desirability of expressing all signals in terms of cosines and
sines of single frequencies – a technique known as Fourier analysis. We
shall look at Fourier Analysis for periodic functions in Chapter 16.
Example 15.21
A system transfer function is known to be
H(s) =
1
3s + 1
then ﬁnd the steady state response to the following:
(a)
f (t) = ej2t;
(b)
f (t) = 3 cos(2t).
Solution
(a) The steady state response to a single frequency ejωt is given
H( jω)ejωt. Here f (t) = ej2t, so in this case ω = 2 and H(s) is given as
1/(3s + 1). Hence we get the steady state response as
H( j2)ej2t =
1
3( j2) + 1ej2t =
ej2t
1 + j6 = (1 −j6)ej2t
37
(b) Using (1/2)(H( jω)ejωt +H(−jω)e−jωt) as the response to cos(ωt)
and substituting for H and ω = 2 gives

Hence, the steady state response to an input of 3 cos(2t) is

z transforms
z transforms are used to solve problems in discrete systems in a man-
ner similar to the use of Laplace transforms for piecewise continuous
systems. We take z transforms of sequences. We shall assume that our
sequences begin with the zeroth term and have terms for positive n .
f0, f1, f2, . . . , fn, . . . is an input sequence to the system. However, when
considering the initial conditions for a difference equation it is conve-
nient to assign them to y−j, . . . , y−2, y−1, etc., where j is the order of
the difference equation. So, in that case, we shall allow some elements
in the sequence with negative subscript. Our output sequence will be
of the form y−j, . . . , y−2, y−1, y0, y1, y2, . . . , yn, . . . where the difference
equation describing the system only holds for n ⩾0.
z transform deﬁnition
The z transform of a sequence f0, f1, f2, . . . , fn, . . . is given by
F(z) =
∞

n=0
fnz−n.
As this is an inﬁnite summation it will not always converge. The set of
values of z for which it exists is called the region of convergence. The
sequence, f0, f1, f2, . . . , fn, . . . is a function of an integer, however, its z
transform is a function of a complex variable z. The operation of taking
the z transform of the sequence fn is represented by Z{fn} = F(z).
Example 15.22
Find the z transform of the ﬁnite sequence 1, 0, 0.5, 3.
Solution
We multiply the terms in the sequence by z−n, where n =
0, 1, 2, . . . and then sum the terms, giving
F(z) = 1 + 0z−1 + 0.5z−2 + 3z−3 = 1 + 0.5

where

or
|z| > |r|
We can see that in the case of inﬁnite sequences there will be a region of
convergence for the z transform.
The impulse function and
the step function
The impulse function or delta function for a discrete system is the
sequence
δn =

1
n = 0
0
n ̸= 0.
The step function is the function
un =

1
n ⩾0
0
n < 0
and the shifted unit step function is
un−j =

1
n ⩾j
0
n < j.
As we are mainly considering sequences deﬁned for n ⩾0, we could
consider that all of the sequences are multiplied by the step function un.
That is, they are all ’switched on’ at n = 0.
Rather than always using the deﬁnition to ﬁnd the z transform, we will
usually make use of a table of well-known transforms and properties of
the z transform to discover the transform of various sequences. A list of
z transforms is given in Table 15.2.

of a geometric progression, Sn = a(rn −1)/(r −1) where a is the ﬁrst

The transfer function and impulse
response function
As before, when considering Laplace transforms, we ﬁnd that an impor-
tant role is played by the impulse response function in systems theory of
discrete systems. If this case is a sequence, hn, its z transform of is called
the transfer function (or system function). We remember from Chapter 14
that a linear, time-invariant system is represented by a linear difference
equation with constant coefﬁcients, that is, a second-order LTI system
can be represented by
ayn + byn−1 + cyn−2 = fn.
If we take fn as the delta function δn, we get
ayn + byn−1 + cyn−2 = δn.
By deﬁnition of the impulse response function we consider all initial
conditions to be 0, that is, y−1 = 0, y−2 = 0; taking the z transform we
get
aY(z) + bz−1Y(z) + cz−2Y(z) = 1
Y(z)(a + bz−1 + cz−2) = 1
Y(z) =
1
a + bz−1 + cz−2
Y(z) =
z2
az2 + bz + c.
Noticethatthepolesofthisfunctionarefoundbysolvingaz2+bz+c = 0,
which we recognize as the auxiliary equation or characteristic equation
from Chapter 14.
This function, the z transform of the impulse response function, is
called the transfer function and is usually denoted by H(z), so we have
H(z) = z2/(az2 + bz + c)
and Z−1{H(z)} = hn, where hn is the impulse response function.
Example 15.32
Find the transfer function and impulse response of the
system described by the following difference equation:
3yn + 4yn−1 = fn
Solution
To ﬁnd the transfer function replace fn by δn and take the z
transform of the resulting equation assuming zero initial conditions:
4yn + 3yn−1 = δn.
Taking the z transform of both sides of the equation we get
4Y + 3(z−1Y + y−1) = 1.
As y−1 = 0,
Y =
z
4z + 3 = H(z) =
z/4
z + (3/4).

We can now see why, in the design of digital ﬁlters, this is referred to
as an inﬁnite impulse response (IIR) ﬁlter. This impulse response has a
non-zero value for all n . Hence it represents an IIR system.
We now discover that we can ﬁnd the system response to any input
sequence fn, with zero initial conditions, by using the transfer function.
Response of a system with zero initial
conditions to any input fn
Assuming all initial conditions are zero, that is, y−1 = 0 and y−2 = 0,
then the equation
ayn + byn−1 + cyn−2 = fn
transforms to become
aY(z) + bz−1Y(z) + cz−2Y(z) = F(z) ⇔y(z) =
F(z)z2
az2 + bz + c.
We have just discovered that the transfer function, H(z), is given by
H(z) =
z2
az2 + bz + c.
Then we ﬁnd that
Y(z) = F(z)H(z).
In order to ﬁnd the response of the system to the function fn we take the
inverse transform of this expression. We are able to use the convolution
property of z transforms, which states:
Z
 n

k=0
fkgn−k

= F(z)G(z)
or equivalently
Z−1{F(z)G(z)} =
n

k=0
fkgn−k.
So we ﬁnd that the response of the system with zero initial conditions to
any input sequence fn is given by the convolution of fn with the system’s
impulse response:
yn = Z−1{F(z)H(z)} = fn ∗hn.
We can use this result to solve two types of problems, given zero initial
conditions. If we know the impulse response function of the system then
we can ﬁnd the system response to any input fn either by convolving the
two sequences
yn =
n

k=0
fkhn−k = fn ∗hn
or by ﬁnding the z transform of fn, F(z), ﬁnding the transfer function of
the system Z{hn} = H(z), then ﬁnding Y(z) = H(z)F(z) and taking
TLFeBOOK

Laplace and z transforms
413
the inverse transform of this to ﬁnd yn. This type of problem is called a
convolution problem. The other type of problem is that given any output,
yn, and given the input, fn, we can deduce the impulse response of the
system. This we do by ﬁnding F(z) = Z{fn}, Y(z) = Z{yn} and then
H(z) = Y(z)/F(z), thus giving the transfer function. To ﬁnd the impulse
response we ﬁnd hn = Z−1{H(z)}.
Example 15.33
The impulse response of a system is known to be hn =
3(0.5)n. Find the response of the system to an input of f (t) = 2un given
zero initial conditions.
Solution
Method 1. We can take z transforms and use
Y(z) = H(z)F(z)
In this case
hn = 3(0.5)n
⇔H(z) = Z{3(0.5)n} =
3z
z −0.5
f (t) = 2un
⇔F(z) = Z{2un} =
2z
z −1
Hence,
Y(z) = H(z)F(z) =
6z2
(z −0.5)(z −1).
As we want to ﬁnd yn, we use partial fractions
6z
(z −0.5)(z −1) =
−6
z −0.5 +
12
z −1
(using the ’cover up’ rule). We can know take the inverse transform to
ﬁnd the system response
yn = Z−1{Y(z)} = Z−1
 −6z
z −0.5 + 12z
z −1
	
= −6(0.5)n + 12un.
Alternative method. Find yn by taking the convolution of fn with the
impulse response function
yn = fn ∗hn = (2un) ∗(3(0.5)n).
By deﬁnition of convolution
yn =
n

k=0
2uk

3(0.5)n−k
=
n

k=0
6(0.5)n−k.
Writing out some of these terms we get
6,
6(0.5 + 1),
6((0.5)2 + 0.5 + 1),
(n = 0)
(n = 1)
(n = 2)
6((0.5)3 + 0.52 + 0.5 + 1).
(n = 3)
We see that each term in the sequence is a geometric progression with
ﬁrst term 6 and common ratio 0.5 and n + 1 terms. Hence
yn = 6(1 −0.5)n+1
1 −0.5
= 12(1 −(0.5)n+1) = 12 −12(0.5)(0.5)n
= 12 −6(0.5)n
which conﬁrms the result of the ﬁrst method.

Laplace and z transforms
The frequency response
As in the case of Laplace transforms and continuous systems, we ﬁnd we
are able to establish a relationship between the transfer function and the
steady state response to a single frequency input.
The steady state response of the system to a sequence representing a
single frequency input, ejωn, is found to be
Y(z) = H(ejω)ejωn.
We can then see that for a single sinusoidal input the steady state response
is found by substituting z = ejω into the transfer function for the system
and multiplying the resulting complex constant by the sinusoidal input.
In other words, the steady state response is a scaled and phase shifted
version of the input. The function H(ejω) is called the frequency response
function for a discrete system.
Example 15.34
A system transfer function is known to be
H(z) =
z
z + 0.2.
Find the steady state response to the following:
(a)
fn = ej2n;
(b)
f (t) = cos(2n).
Solution
(a) The steady state response to a single frequency ejωn is given
by H(ejω)ejωn. fn = ej2n , so in this case ω = 2 and H(z) is given as
z/(z + 0.2). Hence, we get the steady state response as
ej2
ej2 + 0.2ej2n.
(b) Using 1
2H(ejω)ejωt + H(e−jω)e−iωt as the response to cos(ωn) and
substituting for H and ω = 2 gives
yn = 1
2
 ej2ej2n
ej2 + 0.2 +
e−j2
e−j2 + 0.2e−j2n

Expressing this over a real denominator and simplifying gives
cos(2n)(1 + 0.2 cos(2)) + 0.2 sin(2) sin(2n)
1.4 + 0.4 cos(2)
Hence, the steady state response to an input of 3 cos(2n) is
3 cos(2n)(1 + 0.2 cos(2)) + 0.6 sin(2) sin(2n)
1.4 + 0.4 cos(2)
.
15.10 Summary
1.
The Laplace transform F(s) of the function f (t) deﬁned for t ⩾0 is:
F(s) =
 ∞
0
e−stf (t) dt.
The Laplace transform is a function of s, where s is a complex
variable. Because the integral deﬁnition of the Laplace transform
involves an integral to ∞, it is usually necessary to limit possible

values of s so that the integral above converges (i.e. does not tend
to ∞).
2.
The impulse function, δ(t), also called a delta function, is the most
famous example of a generalized function. The impulse function
represents an idealized kick as it lasts for no time at all and has
energy of exactly 1.
3.
Laplace transforms are usually found by using a table of transforms
(as in Table 15.1) and also by using properties of the transform, some
of which are listed in Section 15.4.
4.
Laplace transforms are used to reduce a differential equation to a
simple equation in s-space. This can then be solved and the inverse
transform used to ﬁnd the solution to the differential equation.
5.
The transfer function of the system, H(s), is the Laplace transform of
its impulse response function with zero initial conditions, h(t). The
Laplace transform of the response to any input function, with zero
initial conditions, can be found by multiply the Laplace transform
of the input function by the transfer function of the system Y(s) =
H(s)F(s).
6.
The steady state response to a single frequency input ejωt is
H( jω)ejωt. H( jω) is called the frequency response function.
7.
The z transform of a sequence f0, f1, f2, . . . , fn, . . . is given by
F(z) =
∞

n=0
fnz−n.
As this is an inﬁnite summation it will not always converge. The set
of values of z for which it exists is called the region of convergence.

The discrete impulse function or delta function is deﬁned by
δn =

9.
z transforms are usually found by using a table of transforms (as in
Table 15.2) and also by using properties of the transform, some of
which are listed in Section 15.7
10.
z transforms are used to reduce a difference equation to a simple
equationinz-space. Thiscanthenbesolvedandtheinversetransform
used to ﬁnd the solution to the difference equation.
11.
The transfer function of a discrete system, H(z), is the z transform
of its impulse response function with zero initial conditions, hn. The
z transform of the response to any input function, with zero initial
conditions, can be found by multiply the z transform of the input
function by the transfer function of the system, Y(z) = H(z)F(z).
12.
The steady state response of a discrete system to a single frequency
input ejωn is H(ejω)ejωn · H(ejωn) is called the frequency response
function.

Fourier series
16.1
Introduction
Fourier analysis is the theory behind frequency analysis of signals. This
chapter is concerned with the Fourier analysis of periodic, piecewise con-
tinuous functions. A periodic function can be represented by a Fourier
series. A non-periodic function can be represented by its Fourier trans-
form which we shall not be concerned with here. Discrete functions may
be represented by a discrete Fourier transform, which also we shall not
look at in this book.
Any periodic signal is made up of the sum of single frequency
components. These components consist of a fundamental frequency com-
ponent, multiples of the fundamental frequency, called the harmonics and
abiasterm, whichrepresentstheaverageoff-setfromzero. Therearethree
ways of representing this information which are equivalent. We can rep-
resent the frequency components as the sum of a sine and cosine terms,
or by considering the amplitude and phase of each component, or we can
represent them using a complex Fourier series. The use of the complex
Fourier series simpliﬁes the calculation.
Having found the Fourier components we can use the system’s fre-
quency response function, as found in the previous chapter, to ﬁnd the
steady state response to any periodic signal.
16.2 Periodic
Functions
In Chapter 5 we discussed the property of periodicity of the trigonometric
functions. A periodic function is one whose graph can be translated to the
right or left by an amount, called the period, such that the new graph ﬁts
exactly on top of the original graph. The fundamental period, also called
the cycle, is the minimum non-zero amount the graph needs to be shifted
in order to ﬁt over the original graph.
A periodic function, with period τ, satisﬁes f (t + τ) = f (t) for all
values of t. Examples of periodic functions are given in Figure 16.1.
The fundamental frequency of a periodic function is the number of
cycles in an interval of unit length, f = 1/τ. The fundamental angular
frequency is then given by ω0 = 2πf = 2π/τ. A periodic function need
only be deﬁned in one cycle, as the periodicity property will then deﬁne
it everywhere. For example, the graph of the periodic square wave
f (t) =

1/2
0 < t < 1
−1/2
1 < t < 2
is drawn in Figure 16.2. First, we draw the section of the graph as given
in the deﬁnition and then shift the section along by the period, in this
case 2, and copy the section. By repeatedly shifting and copying in this
way, both to the left and right, we get the graph as shown.
As we mentioned in the introduction there are three ways of expressing
the Fourier series. As a sine and cosine series or in amplitude and phase
form or in complex form.

Fourier series
You will notice that there is an overshoot of the value near the jump
discontinuities. This is an example of Gibb’s phenomenon. However
many terms we take in the partial sum this overshoot remains sig-
niﬁcant, at about 10% of the function value. It is also interesting to
see the value that the Fourier series takes at the discontinuous points,
for example, t = 1. Substituting t = 1 into S3, S5, and S7 gives
0. This is half way between the values of f at either side of the
point t = 1.

functions
We looked at even functions and odd functions in Chapter 2.
Even functions
We ﬁnd that even functions, which have the property that f (−t) = f (t),
have all bn = 0 in their Fourier series. They are represented by cosine
terms only. This is not surprising as the cosine is an even function and
the sine function is odd. We would expect that an even function would
be expressed in terms of other even functions. Another simpliﬁcation in
this case is

Half-wave symmetry
There is another sort of symmetry that has an important effect on the
Fourier series representation. This is called half-wave symmetry. A func-
tion with half-wave symmetry obeys f (t + 1
2τ) = −f (t), that is, the
TLFeBOOK

425
graph of the function in the second half of the period is the same as
the graph of the function in the ﬁrst half turned upside down. A function
with half-wave symmetry has no even harmonics. This can be shown by
considering one of the even terms where n = 2m. Then

A similar argument shows that the coefﬁcients of the cosine terms for
even n are also zero. In this case also it is only necessary to consider the
half-cycle, as

This function has only sine terms in its Fourier series. (c) A function with half-wave symmetry satisﬁes
f (t + τ/2) = −f (t) that is the graph of the function in the second half of the period is the same as the graph of
the function in the ﬁrst half reﬂected in the x-axis. This function has no even harmonics.
16.5 Amplitude
and phase
representation
of a Fourier
series
In Chapter 9, when considering using vectors to represent single fre-
quency waves, we saw that terms like c cos(ωt) −d sin(ωt) can be
represented by a single cosine term A cos(ωt + φ) where A is the ampli-
tude and φ is the phase. The terms A and φ can be found by expressing
the vector (c, d) in polar form. We can employ this idea to represent
the Fourier series in amplitude and phase form. This can be very useful
because, for instance, a ﬁlter may be designed to attenuate frequencies
outside of the desired pass band. this requirement speciﬁes its ampli-
tude characteristics. The phase characteristics may then be considered
separately.
The Fourier series becomes
f (t) = 1
2a0 +
∞

n=1
cn cos(nω0t + φn)
where
cn cos(nω0t + φn) = an cos(nω0t) + bn sin(nω0t)
From the trigonometric identity for cos(A + B), we can expand the left-
hand side of the above expression to get
cn cos(nω0) cos(φn)−cn sin(nω0) sin(φn) = an cos(nω0t)+bn sin(nω0t)
Equating terms in cos(nω0t) and sin(nω0t), we get
cn cos(φn) = an
−cn sin(φn) = bn

giving
cn =

a2n + b2n
and
φn = −tan−1
	bn

(±π if an is negative)
We see that cn∠φn can be found by expressing (an, −bn) in polar form.
The amplitudes can be plotted against the frequency f (or angu-
lar frequency ω) giving the amplitude spectrum and the phases
can be plotted, giving the phase spectrum. The amplitude gives
information about the distribution of energy among the different
frequencies.

them as 0.

16.6 Fourier
series in
complex form
The most useful form of the Fourier series is the amplitude and phase
form of the previous section. cn and φn can often be calculated more
simply by considering the complex form of the Fourier series. We can
ﬁnd this by taking the expression from the previous section:
f (t) = 1
2a0 +
∞

n=1
cn cos(nω0t + φn)
and expressing the cosine terms as the sums of complex exponentials:
cn cos(nω0t + φn) = cn
2 (ej(nω0t+φn) + e−j(nω0t+φn))
= cn
2 ejφn ejnω0t + cn
2 e−jφn e−jnω0t
Then setting
αn = cn
2 ejφn
and
α−n = cn
2 e−jφn
we get
f (t) = 1
2a0 +
∞

n=1
αn ejnω0t + α−n e−jnω0t
⇒f (t) =
n=∞

n=−∞
αn ejnω0t
where α0 = 1
2a0
αn = cn
2 ejφn
and
α−n = cn
2 e−jφn
as cn is real |αn| = |α−n| = cn
2 , and α∗
n = α−n.
Therefore, αn(n > 0) is a complex coefﬁcient of the Fourier series
with amplitude cn/2 and phase φn.
The complex form is generally the most convenient form of the Fourier
series because in the expression
f (t) =
∞

n=−∞
αn ejnω0t
the complex Fourier components can be found from
αn = 1
τ
 τ/2
−τ/2
f (t) e−jnω0t dt
and hence involve performing only a single integration.
This form of the Fourier series gives apparent negative frequencies
but for any real function of time the coefﬁcients of negative frequencies
have equal amplitude to the equivalent positive frequencies and negative
phase. Thus, only the positive frequency coefﬁcients need be given to
totally specify the function.
TLFeBOOK

Fourier series
429
From the complex form, we can easily ﬁnd the amplitude and phase
spectra. If we write the coefﬁcients in exponential form, |αn|ejθ, we ﬁnd
cn = 2|αn| and φn = θn = arg(αn), n ⩾0.
We can also easily ﬁnd the sine and cosine form of the Fourier series
by using
an = 2|αn| cos(φn) = 2 Re(αn)
bn = −2|αn| sin(φn) = −2 Im(αn).

integrating over the half cycle. A function with half-wave symmetry,

Introduction
We concentrated so far in this book on functions of time. In Chapter 5 we
looked at waves that were functions of distance, x, and time, t. For many
applications, we need to analyse functions of the three possible spatial
coordinates, x, y, and z and also of time, t. For instance, consider making
a mug of tea using a tea bag. When ﬁrst brewed, the temperature will be
nearly at boiling point 100◦C. The temperature of the water will start off
being much the same everywhere but it will be cooler near the tea bag
and at the sides of the mug. As time progresses the surface of the tea and
those parts in touch with the mug, will cool quicker than the centre of the
tea. We can see that the temperature of a mug of tea is a function both of
where in the mug we measure it and also the length of time since the tea
was ﬁrst made. This is a function of more than one variable.
Some of the ideas that we have learnt for analysing a function of a
single variable we revisit here for functions of more than one variable.
In this chapter we consider graphs of functions and taking their partial
derivatives, changing variables, using the chain rule and the derivative in
any given direction. To begin we need to think about visualizing these
functions and that means considering how to visualize graphs of functions
that would require three or more dimensions when armed only with a
two-dimensional sheet of paper.
17.2 Functions
of two
variables –
surfaces
When drawing a graph we need one dimension to represent the actual
function value, the dependent variable, for which we have used the ver-
tical axis. When drawing a graph of distance, x or of time t, we are able
to use the horizontal axis of the graph to represent the independent vari-
able. Supposing now we have a function of two spatial dimensions – for
instance, the height above sea level on a landscape or the temperature in
a cup of tea at the surface of the tea. We would like to be able to picture
these functions. However, we need more than one horizontal axis in order
to be able to represent the spatial dimensions x and y when a picture on
a page of this book has only one horizontal direction. We could build
three-dimensional models only this would be time consuming and make
book production even more costly. One of the ways of representing these
graphs on a page of paper is to use a perspective representation of a sur-
face. The other way of doing it is to draw a plan of the function from above
and use contours to represent the function value at each point. You are
familiar with this from maps that mark contours representing the height
of the ground at each point. Another example is meteorological forecasts
that use contours superimposed on maps of the country, to represent the

17.3 Partial
differentiation
From the graphs of functions that we looked at in the last section we can
see that we are able to take a cross-section either parallel to the x-axis or
parallel to the y-axis. Each cross-section can be represented by a function
of one variable only. If we take a cross-section parallel to the x-axis, then

we have ﬁxed y and only x is varying. In this case, we can differentiate
the function as a function of one variable.
It is this idea that is used for partial differentiation. We can ﬁnd the
derivative along a line parallel to the x-axis by ‘freezing’ y and differ-
entiation with respect to x only. We can ﬁnd the derivative along a line
parallel to the y-axis by ‘freezing’ x and differentiation with respect to y
only. Partial derivatives of the function u = f (x, y) are deﬁned by:
∂u
∂x = lim
δx→0
u(x + δx, y) −u(x, y)
δx
∂u
∂y = lim
δy→0
u(x, y + δy) −u(x, y)
δy
∂u/∂x reads as ‘partial du by dx’ and ∂u/∂y reads as ‘partial du by dy’.
Example 17.1
u = x3 −3x2y + y.
Find its partial derivatives ∂u/∂x and ∂u/∂y.
Solution
To ﬁnd ∂u/∂x, we differentiate, u with respect to x and treat
y as though it were a constant
∂u
∂x = 3x2 −3(2)xy = 3x2 −6xy.
To ﬁnd ∂u/∂y, we differentiate u with respect to y and treat x as though
it were a constant
∂u
∂y = −3x2 + 1.
We can substitute particular values for x and y in order to ﬁnd the slope
of the graph parallel to the x- and parallel to the y-axes.

where x = 3, y = 2
(a)

(b)

Solution
(a)
To ﬁnd the slope parallel to the x-axis, we freeze y and differenti-
ating with respect to x, that is, we need the partial derivative with
respect to x
h = 4 −2x2 + y
⇒
∂h
∂x = −4x.
At the point (3, 2), ∂h/∂x = −12 and therefore the slope parallel
to the x-axis is −12.
(b)
To ﬁnd the slope parallel to the y-axis, we freeze x and differenti-
ating with respect to y, that is, we need the partial derivative with
respect to y.
h = 4 −2x2 + y ⇒∂u
∂y = 1.
At the point (3, 2), ∂u/∂y = 1 and therefore the slope parallel to
the y-axis is 1.
17.4 Changing
variables – the
chain rule
Supposing we have a function, u = f (x, y), and x and y are functions
of s and t so that x = v(s, t), y = w(s, t), and u = F(s, t). We want
to ﬁnd a relationship between the partial derivatives of u with respect to
s and t and those with respect to x and y. We assume in the following
discussion that we have well-behaved functions, that is, the functions and
their partial derivatives do not have discontinuities in the region of x, y.
We want to ﬁnd the partial derivative of u with respect to s, that is, we
would like to ﬁnd
∂u
∂s = lim
δs→0
u(s + δs, t) −u(s, t)
δs
.
As we are considering a change of variable so that the point (x, y)
corresponds to the point (s, t) and therefore u(x, y) = u(s, t). We con-
sider a small change, δs, in the variable s so that the point (s + δs, t)
will correspond to some point (x + δx, y + δy) in the (x, y) plane,
where δx and δy are small. Again u(s + δs, t) will have the same value
as u(x + δx, y + δy). Using u(s + δs, t) = u(x + δy, y + δy) =
u(x + δx, y + δy) −u(x, x + δy) + u(x, y + δy) and u(x, y) = u(s, t)
we ﬁnd:
∂u
∂s = lim
δs→0
u(x + δx, y + δy) −u(x, y + δy) + u(x, y + δy) −u(x, y)
δs

As long as δx, δy are not actually equal to 0 we can multiply the ﬁrst term
by δx/δx and the second term by δy/δy. As δs →0, so also δx →0 and
δy →0, hence we get

In the ﬁrst term, we can take the limit as δy →0 to get:

to ﬁnd:

Example 17.3
Given h = 4−2x2 +y and x = r cos(θ), y = r sin(θ),
ﬁnd ∂h/∂r and ∂h/∂θ.
Solution
We can ﬁnd the following partial derivatives:
∂h
∂x = −4x
∂h
∂y = 1
∂x
∂r = cos(θ)
∂y
∂r = sin(θ)
∂x
∂θ = −r sin(θ)
∂y
∂θ = r cos(θ).
To ﬁnd ∂h/∂r we use the chain rule:
∂h
∂r = ∂h
∂x
∂x
∂r + ∂h
∂y
∂y
∂r
∂h
∂r = −4x cos(θ) + sin(θ)
and substituting for x and y gives
∂h
∂r = −4r cos2(θ) + sin(θ)
TLFeBOOK

Functions of more than one variable
Similarly, to ﬁnd ∂h/∂θ we use the chain rule:
∂h
∂θ = ∂h
∂x
∂x
∂θ + ∂h
∂y
∂y
∂θ
∂h
∂θ = 4xr sin(θ) + r cos(θ)
and substituting for x and y gives
∂h
∂θ = 4r2 cos(θ) sin(θ) + r cos(θ).
Check: We should get the same result by substituting for x and y in h
and then directly ﬁnding ∂h/∂r and ∂h/∂θ.
Substituting x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ) into h = 4 −2x2 + y
gives
h = 4 −2r2 cos2(θ) + r sin(θ).
Differentiating h with respect to r and keeping θ constant gives:
∂h
∂r = −4r cos2(θ) + sin(θ).
Differentiating h with respect to θ and keeping r constant gives:
∂h
∂θ = 2r22 cos(θ) sin(θ) + r cos(θ) = 4r2 cos(θ) sin(θ) + r cos(θ)
and we see that these are the same results as before.
17.5 The total
derivative along
a path
We have found the derivatives in the x- and y-directions for some function
u = f (x, y). We would now like to consider the derivative along any
given path, where for instance x = g(t) and y = h(t), that is, both x and
y are a function of t. Consider a small change in u, δu, in the direction of
the path, with a change in t of δt. Then we can deﬁne the total derivative
along the path as:
du
dt = lim
δt→0
u(x + δx, y + δy) −u(x, y)
δt
.
Substituting u(x + δy, y + δy) = u(x + δx, y + δy) −u(x, x + δy) +
u(x, y + δy) and multiplying the ﬁrst term by δx/δx and the second term
by δy/δy gives:
du
dt =
lim
δx→0,δy→0
u(x + δx, y + δy) −u(x, y + δy)
δx

δt→0
δx

As x and y are functions of t only,

and

Functions of more than one variable

so taking the limits in the expression above we get:
du
dt = ∂u
∂x
dx
dt + ∂u
∂y
dy
dt .
This is the second version of the chain rule, where we are not just making a
change of variables but now we are limiting the direction of the derivative
to be along a particular path, such that x = g(t) and y = h(t). This is
the total derivative function along the path and du/dt is the gradient of
the tangent along the path deﬁned by (x(t), y(t)).
Approximations
As we now have a way of determining the gradient along any given path as
du
dt = ∂u
∂x
dx
dt + ∂u
∂y
dy
dt .
We can use this to estimate the value of the function near some known
value (x, y). In Chapter 7, we used the approximation that for small
δx, δy/δx ≈dy/dx. Therefore, along some known path we can use
δx/δt ≈dx/dt, δy/δt ≈dy/dt, and δu/δt ≈du/dt. Substitute these
into the above chain rule above to get: δu/δt ≈(∂u/∂x)(δx/δt) +
(∂u/∂y)(δy/δt). As long as δt is not actually equal to 0, we can multiply
both sides of this equation by δt to get
δu ≈∂u
∂x δx + ∂u
∂y δy.
This expression can be used to approximate the value of a function near
a known value.
Example 17.4
The focal length of a convex lens is given by
1
f = 1
p + 1
q
where p is the distance of some object and q the distance of its image,
measured in both case from the position of the lens. The maximum error
in measurement of distances is known to be 5%. If p and q are measured
as 10 and 2.5 cm, respectively, estimate the focal length of the lens and
the maximum error in your estimate.
Solution
We have p = 0.1 m and q = 0.025 m. Substituting for f gives

f = 1

0.025
⇒

⇔

TLFeBOOK

442
Functions of more than one variable
We can approximate the error for f using:
δf ≈∂f
∂p δp + ∂f
∂q δq
to estimate the maximum error in this value for f . If the error in mea-
surement of p and q could be up to 5%, then the maximum errors for p
and q are given by:
δp = p × 5/100, substitute p = 0.1, giving δp = 0.005
δq = q × 5/100, substitute q = 0.025, giving δq = 0.00125
We also ﬁnd the ﬁrst-order partial derivatives for f from the formula for
f in terms of p and q, which we rewrite as
1
f = q + p
pq
⇔f =
pq
p + q
∂f
∂p = −

∂f
∂q = −
pq
(p + q)2 +
p
p + q = p2 + pq −pq
(p + q)2
=
p2
(p + q)2 .
Substituting p = 0.1 and q = 0.025 gives
∂f
∂p (0.1, 0.025) = 0.04
and
∂f
∂q (0.1, 0.025) = 0.64.
Finally, we can estimate the error for f from
δf ≈∂f
∂p δp + ∂f
∂q δq.
At p = 0.1, q = 0.025, we have δp = 0.005, δq = 0.00125, ∂f /∂p =
0.04, and ∂f /∂q = 0.64, which gives δf ≈0.04 × 0.005 + 0.64 ×
0.00125 = 0.001.
This means that the focal length of the lens is 0.02 m with a maximum
error of approximately 0.001 m.
The chain rule holds whatever variable name we use in place of t, the
parameter to describe the path in the x, y plane. It also holds whatever
path we choose, that is, whatever the functions used for x = g(t) and
y = h(t) (provided all the derivatives exist and are continuous in the
region of the path). Therefore, we can use mathematical shorthand to
give an expression for the total derivative, du:
du = ∂u
∂x dx + ∂u
∂y dy.

Given u = x3 −3y2x +y2 and x = 2t, y = 1−2t, ﬁnd

dt = 6(2t)2 −6(1 −2t)2 + 12(1 −2t)2t −4(1 −2t)
= 24t2 −6 + 24t −24t2 + 24t −48t2 −4 + 8t
= −48t2 + 56t −10.
(b) Substitute x = 2t, y = 1 −2t into u = x3 −−3y2x + y2 giving
u = 8t3 −3(1 −2t)22t + (1 −2t)2
⇔u = 8t3 −3(1 −4t + 4t2)2t + (1 −4t + 4t2)
⇔u = 8t3 −6t + 24t2 −24t3 + 1 −4t + 4t2
⇔u = −16t3 + 28t2 −10t + 1
Therefore, du/dt = −48t2 + 56t −10.

derivatives

partial derivatives such as ∂2u/∂x2, ∂2u/∂y2, ∂2u/∂x∂y, and ∂2u/∂y∂x,

The partial derivatives ∂2u/∂x2, ∂2u/∂y2, ∂2u/∂x∂y, and ∂2u/∂y∂x are
called the second-order partial derivatives of u because we have differ-
entiated twice to ﬁnd them. We can continue differentiating to ﬁnd third-
and higher-order partial derivatives.

Notice that ∂2u/∂x∂y = ∂2u/∂y∂x as expected.
17.7 Summary
1.
A function u(x, y) is a function of two variables x and y; u is the
dependent variable and x and y are the independent variables. The
graph of this function can be represented on the page of a book or a
computer screen by using a perspective representation of a surface
or by using contours to represent the lines where the value of the
function is constant.
2.
A function of two variables f (x, y) has two ﬁrst-order partial deriva-
tives. The partial derivative with respect to x is found by considering
y to be constant and then differentiating with respect to x only. The
partial derivative with respect to y is found by considering x to be a
constant and differentiating with respect to y only.
3.
The chain rule can be used to change the variables of differentiation.

If we know the path on which we are travelling across the surface
f (x, y), so that x and y are deﬁned in terms of a parameter t, then it
is possible to ﬁnd the total derivative of f with respect to t because
the gradient along the path will be unique at each point. It this case
we can use:

Partial derivatives can be used for approximating the value of a
function near a known value. For a function of two variables we
have:
δu ≈∂u
∂x δx + ∂u
∂y δy.
This can also be used to estimate the maximum error in a calculated
value.

In the previous chapter, we looked at functions of more than one variable.
For a function of two variables (x, y) we deﬁne a function u = f (x, y)
which can be represented by a surface. For each pair of values (x, y) we
can ﬁnd a single value for u, showing that u is a scalar quantity. For this
reason, a function of spatial coordinates is called a scalar ﬁeld. We also
saw how to calculate a gradient of a function of two variables and that
the gradient depends on the direction of the path that we choose across
the surface. This means that the gradient must be described by both a
magnitude and a direction. From Chapter 9, we know that vectors are
used to represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction and
we shall show in this chapter that we represent the gradient of a scalar
ﬁeld as a vector ﬁeld.
A vector ﬁeld is a vector function, which means that at each point in
space the function has both magnitude and direction and can be expressed
by a vector with x, y, and z components. In Chapter 6, we quoted
many relationships between physical quantities that involve derivatives.
There we considered only movement in a single spatial direction. Many
of these equations should properly be described by vector ﬁeld equations
in space. In order to express these equations, we need to deﬁne the opera-
tions of divergence and curl of a vector ﬁeld. Vector ﬁeld equations are
particularly important in electromagnetic ﬁeld theory.
In this chapter we give an introduction to vector ﬁelds and operations
on vector ﬁelds with applications to evaluating line and surface integrals.
18.2 The
gradient of a
scalar ﬁeld
We deﬁne the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld as follows
∇φ = ∂φ
∂x i + ∂φ
∂y j + ∂φ
∂z k =
∂φ
∂x , ∂φ
∂y , ∂φ
∂z

.
∇φ is the gradient of φ, or simply ‘grad φ’, ∇is called the ‘del’ operator.
The meaning of this deﬁnition is that we take the partial derivative of the
scalar ﬁeld with respect to x, y, and z, and these are the components of
our vector ﬁeld.
This deﬁnition is equivalent to
∇φ =

i ∂
∂x + j ∂
∂x + k ∂
∂x

φ
and also to
∇φ =
 ∂
∂x , ∂
∂x , ∂
∂x

φ.
If φ is deﬁned for two spatial dimensions (x, y) only then we would have
∇φ = ∂φ
∂x i + ∂φ
∂y j =
∂φ
∂x , ∂φ
∂y

.

Example 18.1
Given φ = x2 + xyz, ﬁnd the vector ﬁeld that describes
its gradient.
Solution
We use
∇φ = ∂φ
∂x i + ∂φ
∂y j + ∂φ
∂z k.
Differentiating φ partially with respect to x, y, and z, we ﬁnd:
∂φ
∂x = 2x + yz
∂φ
∂y = xz
∂φ
∂z = xy.
Therefore, we ﬁnd that
∇φ = (2x + yz)i + xzj + xyk = (2x + yz, xz, xy).
Direction of maximum slope
We would like to know why this vector function is called the gradient.
We saw in the last chapter that a function of more than one variable has
many derivatives associated with it, depending on the direction that we
choose to measure it. We found that for a function of φ of two variables,
along a path deﬁned by (x(t), y(t)), the derivative of φ is given by:
dφ
dt = ∂φ
∂x
dx
dt + ∂φ
∂y
dy
dt .
Using the deﬁnition of the scalar product, we can write the above as
dφ
dt =
∂φ
∂x , ∂φ
∂y

·
dx
dt , dy
dt

= ∇φ ·
dx
dt , dy
dt

where (dx/dt, dy/dt) has components representing the rate of change of
x and y and therefore gives the direction of the path in the (x, y) plane.
We also know from Chapter 9 that for two vectors a and b:
a · b = ab cos(θ)
where a · b is the scalar product of vectors a and b, θ is the angle
between them and a, b are their magnitudes. If the direction of b could be
chosen in order to maximize this scalar product we would choose θ = 0,
because | cos(θ)| ⩽1 with the maximum value occurring at θ = 0, where
cos(θ) = 1. So to maximize the scalar product we choose the direction of
b to be along a. So the direction of the path which maximizes the scalar
product
dφ
dt =
∂φ
∂x , ∂φ
∂y
 dx
dt , dy
dt

will be when the direction of (dx/dt, dy/dt) is the same as that of ∇φ.
So ∇φ gives the magnitude and direction of maximum gradient of φ and
the slope in any general direction can be found by taking the component
of ∇φ in the direction of interest.

Example 18.2
Given φ = z −x1/2 −y3/2, ﬁnd the vector ﬁeld that
describes its gradient, where x, y > 0 and ﬁnd the maximum slope at the
point (4, 9, 1).
Solution
We use
∇φ = ∂φ
∂x i + ∂φ
∂y j + ∂φ
∂z k.
Differentiating φ partially with respect to x, y, and z, we ﬁnd:
∂φ
∂x = −1
2x−1/2
∂φ
∂y = −1
2y−1/2
∂φ
∂z = 1.
Therefore, we ﬁnd that
∇φ = −1
2x−1/2i −1
2y−1/2j + k =


2x−1/2, −1
2y−1/2, 1

Therefore, themaximumslopeatthepoint(4, 9, 1)isgivenbysubstituting
x = 4, y = 9, and z = 1 into the above expression for grad φ giving
(−1/4, −1/6, 1). This has a magnitude of

The ∇(del) operator

∇φ =

φ
or equivalently
∇φ =

This same operator can be used when differentiating vector ﬁelds.

Differentiating
vector ﬁelds
We now consider vector ﬁelds, which represent a vector at each point in
space. Therefore, we have the ﬁeld F which has components in the x, y,
and z directions, all of which are also functions of x, y, and z, that is
F(x, y, z) = iFx + jFy + kFz = (Fx, Fy, Fz)
where Fx, Fy, Fz are all functions of x, y, and z.
There are two important ﬁelds that can be found by differentiating
vector ﬁelds. The divergence of a vector ﬁeld produces a scalar ﬁeld and
the curl of a vector ﬁeld produces a vector ﬁeld. These are deﬁned as
follows
∇·F = div F = ∂Fx
∂x + ∂Fy
∂y + ∂Fz
∂z
∇×F = curl F =

The last expression can also be represented by using a determinant to
deﬁne the cross-product of a vector. We have that
∇×F =
 ∂


.
There is one more operator that is used in many equations of electromag-
netic ﬁelds. This is the ‘del squared’ operator ∇2 which operates on a
scalar ﬁeld. This is deﬁned by
∇2 = ∇· ∇=

·
 ∂
∂x , ∂

= ∂2
∂x + ∂2
∂y + ∂2
∂z.
All of these operators are important in describing vector ﬁeld relation-
ships. For instance
∇2φ = k2 ∂2φ
∂t2
represents the three-dimensional wave equation.
Example 18.3
For F = (2x2y, 4y2z, 8z2) ﬁnd ∇·F and ∇×F.
Solution
From the deﬁnition
∇·F = ∂Fx
∂x + ∂Fy
∂y + ∂Fz
∂z
TLFeBOOK

we see that we ﬁnd the scalar ﬁeld by partially differentiating the ﬁrst
component by x, the second by y, and the third by z, and summing the
result. Hence
∇·F = 4xy + 8yz + 16z.
To ﬁnd ∇×F we use the deﬁnition in terms of the determinant and expand
about the ﬁrst row, which in this case gives:
∇× F =

derivatives is not important. Then all the terms in the above cancel out
giving

18.4 The scalar
line integral
The result of integrating a scalar ﬁeld along a given curve is important for
calculating many physical quantities. We know that in one dimension we
relate the work done by a force in moving from one location to another
as W =

F dx, where F is the force, W is the work done or energy
used and x is the distance moved in the direction of the force. In three
dimensions, an object can move along a path and the position of the object
will vary such that r = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) where t is some parameter used
to describe the path taken. The work done in any given direction will be
given by the component of the force in that direction multiplied by the
distance moved. Hence we ﬁnd:
W =

C
F · dr
where C is the path along which the object moves and r describes its
position vector. To calculate this value we need to be able to integrate
ﬁelds along a path, where the path is described in terms of a position
vector, r = (x(t), y(t), z(t)).
We use
dr
dt =
dx

dr = dr

where F = (2xy, 3z, 12xyz), and C is a path clockwise around a triangle
ABC with vertices A(1,0,−1), B (1,1,1), C (0,1,1).
Solution
We need to integrate along each of the three sides of the trian-
gle. We need, in each case to ﬁnd the equation of the line along the side
of the triangle. The vector equation of a line between two points a and b
was found in Chapter 9 to be r = a(1−t)+bt where t is some parameter
and for points between A and B then 0 ⩽t ⩽1.
From A to B: r = (1, 0, −1)(1 −t) + (1, 1, 1)t = (1, t, −1 + 2t). So
x = 1, y = t, and z = −1 + 2t, and

Integrals round a closed curve
If we are calculating the line integral round a closed curve in a plane
(where the ﬁeld is a function of x and y only) we can use Green’s theorem
in a plane to convert the integral into a double integral over the enclosed
surface. This theorem is as follows


Fx dx + Fy dy =

∂Fy
∂x −∂Fx
∂y dx dy.
The left-hand side of this expression represent the integral of F · dr,
as before, however now we are limited to considering a plane so that
r = (x, y) and also the path of integration must be closed. The fact that
C is a closed path is indicated by the small circle on the integral sign.

We have F = (3x2, −4xy) = (Fx, Fy) and therefore
∂Fy
∂x = −4y
and
∂Fx
∂y = 0.
The surface is a rectangle so the limits for the integration are easy to
establish as being for x from 0 to 4 and for y from 0 to 1. Hence, we get
the surface integral.

To perform a multiple integral we simply do one integral and then inte-
grate the result. The order of performing the integrations will not matter
in this case because the limits of integration are independent of the other
variable and the integrals exists and are continuous in the relevant region.
We do the inner integration with respect to x. Here we are integrating
−4y, which does not contain a term in x, so we treat it as a constant for
the purposes of the ﬁrst integration giving the integral as −4yx.

18.5 Surface
integrals
Many problems in ﬁeld theory involve the calculation of ﬂux of a vector
ﬁeld out of some enclosed surface. This requires us to integrate a vec-
tor ﬁeld over the surface. Such problems are simpliﬁed by using the
divergence theorem, which relates the integral of a vector ﬁeld over a
bounding surface to the integral of the divergence of the ﬁeld over the
enclosed volume.

S
F · dS =

V
(∇·F) dV .
S is a surface enclosing the volume V . This expresses the relationship
between the amount of source material in a volume and the ﬂux out of
the enclosing surface. An example is the relationship between electric
charge within a volume and the ﬂux of the resulting electric ﬁeld.
Example 18.8
Given F = (x −y + z, 2x2y, 1) ﬁnd the integral of F
over the closed surface consisting of the edges of the cube 0 ⩽x ⩽3,
0 ⩽y ⩽3 and 0 ⩽z ⩽3.

Example 18.9.
We can see from the ﬁgure that the sides of the tetrahedron lie along
the x, y- and z-axes and the fourth side is the plane ABC, given by the
equation x + y + z = 1. In this simple case, we can guess the equation
of this plane and check that it is correct by substituting the values for the
points A (1,0,0), B (0,1,0), and C (0,0,1). We need to choose the limits
of integration so that we integrate correctly over this tetrahedron. x must
start from 0 and go up to values lying on the plane ABC. This means that
x is from 0 to 1 −y −z. If we integrate for x ﬁrst then when considering
the integration for y, we will have eliminated the x variable and will be
left with the y, z plane. So y goes between y = 0 and the line BC, given

Graph theory
19.1
Introduction
A graph consists of points, called vertices, and lines connecting them,
called edges. They can be used to represent many diverse situations, for
example ﬁve cities and ﬁve roads connecting them as in Figure 19.1. The
same graph could represent some people and the edge connections could
represent those people who do business with each other.
Sometimes the relationship is ‘one-way’, for instance, in the case of a
network of one-way streets, or a graph representing a circuit where the
arrows on the edges represent the current ﬂow. In this case, the graph is
called a directed graph, shortened to ‘digraph’.
We will look at a few deﬁnitions and applications of different types
of graph and their matrix representations (which we also looked at in
Chapter 13). We also look applications to the solving of routing problems
through networks.
19.2 Deﬁnitions
Graph
A graph G consists of a ﬁnite set of vertices V (G), which cannot be
empty and a ﬁnite set of edges, E(G), which connect pairs of vertices.
The number of vertices of G is called the order of G. The number of edges
in G is represented by |E| and the number of vertices by |V |.
The graph in Figure 19.2 has |V | = 6 and |E| = 9.
Figure 19.2
A graph with six
vertices and nine edges.
Incidence, adjacency, and neighbours
Two vertices are adjacent if they are joined by an edge. In Figure 19.2, v3
is adjacent to v4 and is also said to be a neighbour of v4. The edge which
joins the vertices is said to be incident to them. That is e3 is incident to
v3 and v4.
Multiple edges and loops, simple graphs
Two or more edges joining the same pair of vertices are multiple edges.
An edge joining a vertex to itself is called a loop. In Figure 19.2
Figure 19.1
Five cities with ﬁve roads connecting them represented
by a graph.
TLFeBOOK

462
Graph theory
edges e5 and e9 are multiple edges and e8 is a loop. A graph containing
no multiple edges or loops is called a simple graph. There is an example
of a simple graph in Figure 19.3.

isomorphic graphs.

(a) A digraph;
and (b) its underlying graph.
Isomorphism
Graphs are isomorphic to each other if one can be obtained from a
redrawing of the other one. Some isomorphic graphs are shown in
Figure 19.4.
Weighted graph
A weighted graph has a number assigned to each of its edges, called its
weight. The weight can be used to represent distances or capacities. A
weighted graph is shown in Figure 19.5.
Digraphs
A digraph is a directed graph, that is, instead of edges in the deﬁnition of
graphs we have arcs join pairs of vertices in a speciﬁed order. A digraph
is shown in Figure 19.6(a).
Underlying graph
The underlying graph of a digraph D is the graph obtained by replacing
each arc by an (undirected) edge as in Figure 19.6(b).
Degrees
The number of times edges are incident to a vertex, v, is called its degree,
denoted by d(v). In Figure 19.2 vertex v5 has degree 3 and vertex v3 has
degree 4.
A vertex of a digraph has an in-degree d−(v) and an out-degree, d+(v).
In Figure 19.6(a) v5 has in-degree of 1 and out-degree of 2. Vertex v1 has
in-degree 1 and out-degree 1.
The sum of the values of the degree, d(v), over all the vertices of a
graph totals to twice the number of edges:

i
d(vi) = 2|E|
where |E| is the number of edges.
Checking this result for Figure 19.2, we ﬁnd that the degrees are
d(v1) = 2, d(v2) = 5, d(v3) = 4, d(v4) = 2, d(v5) = 3, and d(v6) = 2.
Summing these gives 18, which is the same as twice the number of edges.
For a digraph we get

i
d−(vi) = |A|
and

i
d+(vi) = |A|
where |A| is the number of arcs.
TLFeBOOK

Graph theory
463
Subgraph
A subgraph of G is a graph, H, whose vertex set is a subset of G’s vertex
set, and similarly its edge set is a subset of the edge set of G.
V (H) ⊆V (G)
E(H) ⊆E(G)
If it spans all of the vertices of G, that is, V (H) = V (G) then H is called a
spanning subgraph of G. A graph G, a subgraph, and a spanning subgraph
are shown in Figure 19.7.
Complete graph
A simple graph in which every pair of two vertices is adjacent is called
a complete graph. Kn is the complete graph with n vertices. Kn has
1
2n(n −1) edges. Some examples of complete graphs are shown in
Figure 19.8.
Bipartite graph
This is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into two sets in such a
way that each edge joins a vertex of the ﬁrst set to a vertex of the second
set. Some examples are given in Figure 19.9.
A complete bipartite graph is a bipartite simple graph in which every
vertex in the ﬁrst set is adjacent to every vertex in the second set. Km,n is
the complete bipartite graph with m vertices in the ﬁrst set and n vertices

in the second set. Some examples of complete bipartite graphs are given
in Figure 19.9(b) and (c).
Walks, paths, and circuits
A sequence of edges of the form
vsvi, vivj, vjvk, vkvl, vlvt
is a walk of from vs to vt. If these edges are all distinct then the walk is
called a trail and if the vertices are also distinct then the walk is called a
path. A walk or trail is closed if vs = vt. A closed walk in which all the
vertices are distinct except vs and vt is called a cycle or circuit. Examples
are given in Figure 19.10.
Connected graph
A graph G is connected if there is a path from any one of its vertices to
any other vertex. A disconnected graph is said to be made up of com-
ponents. All the graphs we have drawn so far have been connected. In
Figure 19.11(a), there is a disconnected graph with two components and
in Figure 19.11(b) a disconnected graph with three components.

Planar graphs
A planar graph is one which can be drawn in the plane without any edges
intersecting except at vertices to which they are both incident. There is
an example of a planar graph in Figure 19.12(a) and a non-planar graph
in Figure 19.12(b).
19.3 Matrix
representation
of a graph
The incidence matrix and
adjacency matrix
The incidence matrix of a graph G is a |V | × |E| matrix. The element
aij = the number of times that vertex vi is incident with the edge ej.
The adjacency matrix of G is the |V |×|V | matrix. aij = the number of
edges joining vi and vj. The incidence matrix for the graph in Figure 19.2
is given by

19.4 Trees
A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. A forest is a graph with no
cyclesbutmayormaynotbeconnected(i.e. aforestisagraphwhosecom-
ponents are trees). Figure 19.13(a) shows a tree, while Figure 19.12(b)
shows a forest.

(a) A tree is a connected graph with no
cycles. (b) A forest has no cycles, but may or may not
be connected.
Figure 19.14
A parsing tree for the sentence
‘Fortune favours the brave’.
If T is a tree with at least two vertices, then it has the three properties
(T1), (T2), and (T3):
(T1) There is exactly one path from any vertex vi in T to any other
vertex vj.
(T2) The graph obtained from T by removing any edge has two
components, each of which is a tree.
(T3) |E| = |V | −1.
Trees have many applications, particularly rooted trees. Decision trees
are used to represent the possible decisions at each stage of a problem
or algorithm. Probability trees can be used to analyse conditional prob-
abilities, which we shall see in Chapter 21. Another application is to
parsing of a sentence. The tree in Figure 19.14 represents the sentence
‘Fortune favours the brave’. The vertices, other than the terminal vertices,
represent grammatical categories and the terminal vertices represent the
words of the sentence. The same sort of idea can be used to analyse
allowed constructs of statements in programming languages and the syn-
tax of arithmetic expressions. We look at this application of trees in the
next chapter on language theory.
Spanning trees
A spanning tree of a graph G is a tree T which is a spanning subgraph
of G. That is, T has the same vertex set as G. Examples of graphs with
spanning trees marked are given in Figure 19.15.
How to grow a spanning tree
Take any vertex v of G as an initial partial tree. Add edges one by one so
each new edge joins a new vertex to the partial tree. If there are n vertices
in the graph G then the spanning tree will have n vertices and n−1 edges.

Figure 19.16
A weighted complete
graph. The vertices represent
ofﬁces and the edges represent
possible communication links. The
weights on the edges represent the
cost of construction of the link.
Minimum spanning tree
Supposing we have a group of ofﬁces which need to be connected by
a network of communication lines. The ofﬁces may communicate with
each other directly or through another ofﬁce. In order to decide on which
ofﬁces to build links between we ﬁrstly work out the cost of all possible
connections. This will then give us a weighted complete graph as shown
in Figure 19.16.
The minimum spanning tree is then the spanning tree that represents
the minimum cost.

TLFeBOOK

468
Graph theory
Example 19.1
Find the minimum spanning tree for the graph repre-
senting communication links between ofﬁces as shown in Figure 19.16.
Solution
We start with any vertex and choose the one marked a. Add
the edge ab which is the cheapest edge of those incident to a.
Add a new edge in order to form a partial tree and choose bc, which is
one of the cheapest remaining edges incident either with a or b. Now we
add edge ad which is the cheapest remaining edge of those incident with
a or b or c. Continuing in this manner we ﬁnd the minimum spanning
tree, as shown in Figure 19.17. The total cost of the communication links
in our solution is found to be 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 14.
19.5 The
shortest path
problem
The weights on a graph may represent delays on a communication net-
work or travel times along roads. A practical problem that we may wish
to solve is to ﬁnd the shortest path from any two vertices. The algorithm
for solving this problem is illustrated in Example 19.2.
Example 19.2
The weighted graph in Figure 19.18 represents a com-
munication network with weights indicating the delays associated with
each edge. Find the minimum delay path from s to t.
Solution
Stage 1
To ﬁnd the path we begin at the start vertex s. s is the reference vertex
for stage 1. Label all the adjacent vertices with the lengths of the paths
using only one edge. Mark all the other vertices with a very high number
(bigger than the sum of all the weights in the graph) in this case we choose
100. This is shown in Figure 19.19.
At the same time start to ﬁll in a table as in Table 19.1.

Stage 2
Choose the vertex with the smallest label, that has not already been a
reference vertex, so that this becomes the new reference vertex. In this
case we choose vertex a. Once a vertex has been used as a reference
vertex it gains a permanent label and for this reason we circle the label in
bold, as in Figure 19.20 and circle the label in the table as in Table 19.2.
This label represents the length of the shortest path from s to the new
reference vertex. Consider any vertex adjacent to the new reference vertex
and calculate the length of the path via a to this vertex. If this is less than
the current temporary label on the vertex then change the label on the
vertex. For instance, b is adjacent to vertex a. The length of the path to b
via a is 4 + 9 = 13. This is not less than the current label of 11, so we
keep the current label. However, looking at vertex d, which is adjacent
to a, the length of the path via a is 4 + 8 = 12, which is shorter than the
current label of d, hence we change the current label. Considering also
the vertices b and f, we end up at the end of Stage 2, with the labels as
given in Figure 19.20 and in Table 19.2.
Stage 3
Choose the vertex with the smallest label that has not already been a
reference vertex; this becomes the new reference vertex. In this case we
choose vertex c, so this gains a permanent label which we circle in bold
as in Figure 19.21; we also circle the label as in Table 19.3. This label
represents the length of the shortest path from s to c. Consider any vertex
adjacent to c which does not have a permanent label, and calculate the
length of the path via c to this vertex. If this is less than the current
temporary label on the vertex then change the label on the vertex. For
instance, d is adjacent to vertex c. The length of the path to d via c is
7 + 4 = 11. This is less than the current label of 12 so we change the
label. However, looking at vertex b, which is adjacent to c, the length
of the path via c is 7 + 5 = 12 which is longer than the current label of
11, so we keep the current label. Considering also the vertex e we end
up, at the end of Stage 3, with the labels as given in Figure 19.21 and
Table 19.3.
Stage 4
Choose e as the new reference vertex and mark its label in bold. Compare
paths via e to the labels on any adjacent vertices and re-label the vertices
if the paths via e are found to be shorter. The result of this stage is shown
in Figure 19.22 and Table 19.4.
Stage 5
Choose b as the new reference vertex (we could choose d instead but this
would make no difference to the ﬁnal result) and circle its label in bold.
Compare paths via b to the labels on any adjacent vertices and relabel the

vertices if the paths via b are found to be shorter. The result of this stage
is shown in Figure 19.23 and Table 19.5.
Stage 6
Choose d as the new reference vertex and mark its label in bold. The only
vertices left without permanent labels are t and f. We ﬁnd that the path
via d to t gives a smaller value than the current label of 15 and hence
we change the label to 11 + 2 = 13. The result of this stage is shown in
Figure 19.24 and Table 19.6.
Stage 7
The remaining vertex with the smallest label is t. We therefore give t the
permanent label of 13. As soon as t receives a permanent label we can
stop the algorithm as this must now represent the length of the shortest
path from s to t which is the result we set out to ﬁnd. To ﬁnd the actual
path that has this length we move backwards from t looking for consistent
labels. To get to t we must have gone through d as adding the label on
d to the length of edge dt gives the correct value of 13. Continuing this

19.6 Networks
and maximum
ﬂow
A network is a digraph with a weight function. The weight function
represents the number of links between the vertices, for example the
units of trafﬁc (channels) in a communication network, or the maximum
capacity of a network of one way streets in a busy town. This weight
function value is called the capacity of the arc. An example of a network
is shown in Figure 19.26. s is the source and t is the sink. The capacity
of an arc, ak will be referred to as c(ak). We wish to ﬁnd the maximum
possible ﬂow from s the source to the sink t. That is we want to ﬁnd a
ﬂow function f (ak) assigning a ﬂow to each of the arcs which gives this
maximum ﬂow.
Flow function
A valid ﬂow function must be such that:
1.
f (ak) ⩽c(ak).
2.
The out-ﬂow at any vertex equals the in-ﬂow except at the source or
the sink.
An arc is saturated if f (ak) = c(ak). The total ﬂow is then the ﬂow out
of s (which equals the ﬂow into t).

Finding a maximum ﬂow
1.
Assign an initial ﬂow to each edge (this will probably be 0 ﬂow on
each arc).
2.
Find a ﬂow-augmenting path from s to t. Any arc along this ﬂow-
augmenting path may be either in the forward direction, that is,
in the same direction as the path, or in the backward direction,
that is, in the opposite direction to the path. If the arc along the
path is in the forward direction, then it must have some ‘extra’
capacity c(ak) ⩾f (ak) then the extra capacity is represented by
k = c(ak) −f (ak). If the arc along the path is in the backward
direction, then f (ak) must be greater than 0 and we assign the
possible increase in ﬂow k = f (ak). We can then calculate the
amount that this path can augment the ﬂow by as  = minimum
(k), where we consider all the values of along the path.
3.
We can now change the value of the ﬂow function along the ﬂow-
augmenting path to f (ak) +  (for arcs in the forward direction
along the path) and f (ak) − (for arcs in the backward direction
along the path). We then repeat the second stage and look for another
ﬂow-augmenting path. If no more ﬂow-augmenting paths exist, then
we have found the maximum ﬂow. This algorithm is due to Ford
and Fulkerson. It can take a long while to terminate on complicated
networks and better algorithms have been developed, for example,
the Dinic algorithm which is not given here. We can check that we
have in fact found the maximum ﬂow in the network by ﬁnding
the minimum cut. The max-ﬂow, min-cut theorem states that the
maximum value of a ﬂow from s to t in a network is equal to the
minimum capacity of a cut separating s and t.
Example 19.3
Find the maximum ﬂow from s to t in the network shown
in Figure 19.27(a). The weights on the arcs represent their capacities.
Solution
We begin by identifying a ﬂow-augmenting path s, e, t. As
initially we consider the ﬂow function to be zero then the spare capacities
along the arcs are 12 and 14, the minimum of which is 12. We therefore
assign a ﬂow of 12 along the path to get Figure 19.27(b).
TLFeBOOK

Graph theory
473
We spot another ﬂow-augmenting path, s, c, d, t with a possible ﬂow
of 10 (the minimum of 14, 19, and 10). We add 10 to the ﬂow function
along this path to give Figure 19.27(c).
We identify the ﬂow-augmenting path s, a, b, t with a possible
ﬂow of 8 (the minimum of the values of the spare capacities of 14,
8 and 15). We add 8 to the ﬂow function along this path to give
Figure 19.27(d).
Another ﬂow-augmenting path is s, a, c, d, b, t with a possible
ﬂow of 6 (the minimum of the values of the spare capacities of 6,
14, 9, 6, 7). We add 6 to the ﬂow function along this path to give
Figure 19.27(e).
There are no more entirely forward paths but we can see one that
involves an arc in the backward direction, that has a non-zero ﬂow
function. This path is s, c, a, e, t where ca is in the backward direc-
tion. We take the minimum of the spare capacity in the forward direction
along with the value of the ﬂow in the backward direction. This gives 2
as the minimum of 4, 6, 3, and 2. We add 2 to the ﬂows on the arcs in
the forward direction and subtract 2 from the ﬂow on ca which is in the
backward direction. Note that this process is equivalent to redirecting the
ﬂow. We have now reached Figure 19.27(f). We are unable to identify
any more ﬂow-augmenting paths. We can conﬁrm that this is in fact a
solution to the maximum ﬂow problem by using the max-ﬂow, min-cut
theorem. If we look at the cut marked we see that this has a capacity of
38. To ﬁnd this we add the capacities of all the arcs which cross the cut
from the ‘s end’ to the ‘t end’, that is, db, with a capacity of 6, dt with a
capacity of 10 and et with a capacity of 14. This cut has a capacity of 38
in total which is the value of the ﬂow we have found.

A state transition diagram is used to represent a ﬁnite state machine.
These are used to model objects which have a ﬁnite number of possible
states and whose interaction with the outside world can be described by
its state changes in response to a ﬁnite number of events. A state transition
diagram is a digraph whose nodes are states and whose directed arcs are

transitions labelled by event names. A state is drawn as a rounded box
containing an optional name. A transition is drawn as an arc with the
arrow from the receiving state to the target state. The label on the arrow
is the name of the event causing the transition. State transition diagrams
have a number of applications. They are used in object-oriented modelling
techniques to represent the life cycle of an object. They can be used as
a ﬁnite state recognizer for a regular language, for instance, to describe
regular expressions used as variables in computer languages.
Example 19.4
A telephone has the attributes of off-hook (TRUE,
FALSE), connected (TRUE, FALSE), dialing (TRUE, FALSE), tone (dial
tone , engaged, ringing, error, dead or none), and bell (ON, OFF). These
TLFeBOOK

476
Graph theory
can be represented as a list (off-hook, connected, dialing, tone, bell)
which can take a selection of values to indicate the current state of the
telephone, for example, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, engaged, OFF indicates
that the phone is off-hook, it is not connected, it is not dialing it has the
engaged tone, and the bell is OFF. Use your knowledge of the operation
of a telephone to give a full list of the possible states of the phone. Draw
a state transition diagram to represent the life-cycle of the phone.
Solution
The possible states are given in Table 19.8.
The possible events are: Pick up receiver, replace receiver, wait, dial
a number, someone calls your number. The events that are possible and
the transitions that they cause depend on the current state of the phone.
The state transition diagram is shown in Figure 19.28.

test whether a certain string is accepted by the DFSR:

Start at the start state, labelled as S.

Take a letter from the left of the string. If possible, move along a
transition arc labelled with that letter.
3.
Repeat step 2 moving through the DFSR until either you ﬁnd that
you cannot move because there is no appropriately labelled arc or the
string is exhausted. If, when the string is exhausted you have reached
the halt state (marked as H in a square box) then the string has been
accepted. If, when the string is exhausted you have not reached the
halt state, or if at any point there are no legal moves, then the string
is not accepted.

(b)

Solution
(a)
We ﬁnd a path from S to H along arcs labelled abbc. To do this, we
travel along arcs in the following order SS, SA, AB, BH. As this
path begins with S and ends with H we have shown that the DFSR
recognizes the string abbc.
(b)
We look at the path labelled abbb beginning at S. The only possible
path is: SSAB. As this path does not end at H we have shown that
the DFSR does not recognize the string abbb.
(c)
We look for a path labelled ababab. No such path exists as it would
begin with the arcs SS, SA and then there is no arc out of A labelled
‘b’. As there are no more legal moves we have shown that the string
is not accepted.

Language theory

Introduction
Weallusenaturallanguagetocommunicate. Inanaturallanguage, thereis
no strictly formal way of deciding exactly what is or is not an acceptable
sentence. This is because natural language is constantly evolving and
subject to cultural diversities. The meaning of a sentence in a natural
language is yet another problem. A sentence may have different meanings
in different parts of the world or because of ambiguities arising from its
structure. If I say ‘I locked my car keys in my boot’ in England I have
accidentally left my car keys in the boot (trunk) of my car. In America I
have cleverly forced them into a lockable shoe. If I say ‘Green ﬁelds like
a wet blanket’ I could be making a poetic reference to the covering of
dew or rain being helpful for keeping a ﬁeld green or I could be making
disparaging comments about a cricket ﬁelder called Green. Meanings
associated with language are called semantics whereas its structure forms
the syntax of the language.
There are reasons for requiring a simpler deﬁnition of language to use
in formal situations. For instance, there are programming languages used
for writing computer instructions. We would hope that the decision as
to whether a particular sequence of symbols forms a program could be
exactly determined. Also we would like to reduce any ambiguities as to its
meaning so that any computer faced with the same program might take
the same actions. Even in natural language it can be desirable to have
rules that can be applied to the language to produce a generally accepted
version of the language. This can be used for cross-cultural exchange
and such a formalized version of a language can also simplify translation
from one natural language to another.
A formal language consists of a set of sequences of symbols called
sentences. The membership of the language set is usually deﬁned by
using grammar rules. Using the grammar rules to determine whether a
particular string of symbols constitutes a sentence is called parsing. One
way to do this would be to repeatedly use the grammar rules to list all
the sentences in the language and stop if our sentence appears. This is
not very practical because the number of sentences in a languages can
be very large or even inﬁnite. A reﬁnement of this approach would be to
use the grammar rules to ﬁnd all sentences at least as long as the string
of symbols we are interested in and check whether our sentence appears.
These are called top-down approaches because we start with the rules
and derive sentences. Alternatively, we could try and start with a string
of symbols and test whether it obeys the grammar rules provided. This
is a bottom-up approach which involves applying the grammar rules in
reverse. We ﬁnd that only certain sorts of grammars are easy, or possible,
to use in reverse in this manner. For these grammars, which are easier
to parse, we can deﬁne a procedure to test whether any given string is
a sentence. The procedure that is used is called a parser. Identifying
TLFeBOOK

480
Language theory
grammars with simple parsing procedures is an important consideration
when designing a new computer language.
We look at eXtensible Markup Language (XML) as a method of
deﬁning a markup language. There are many easily accessible tools for
checking whether an XML document is well formed and it is therefore
ideal as a way of communicating data.
20.2 Languages
and grammars
Deﬁnitions
A language is a set of sequences of symbols. A sequence of symbols is
called a string.
An element of the language set is called a sentence. Some texts refer
to the element of the language as a word or sometimes a well-formed
formula or well-formed document depending on the type of language
being discussed. For instance, logical expressions involving propositions
or predicates, which we looked at in Chapter 3, can be regarded as sen-
tences in the language of logic. In this case an expression which makes
sense is called a well-formed formula or wff (pronounced ‘woof’). An
example of a logical sentence or wff is ‘p∧q⇒p’ but ‘p⇔∧q’ is not
a sentence.
A symbol which forms part of a sentence is called a terminal symbol.
For instance, the terminal symbols in the sentence ‘The cat sat on the
mat’ are ‘The’, ‘cat’, ‘sat’, ‘on’, ‘the’ and ‘mat’. The terminal symbols
in ‘p ∧q⇒p’ are ‘p’, ‘∧’, ‘q’ and ‘⇒’.
Other symbols are used to express the grammar rules for the language.
These symbols are called non-terminal symbols. In a natural language we
could say that a simple sentence is made up of a noun phrase followed
by a verb phrase possibly followed by a noun phrase. Then symbols
representing ‘simple sentence’, ‘noun phrase’ and ‘verb phrase’ would
be amongst our non-terminal symbols. In logic, we could say that a binary
operation consists of a proposition followed by a binary operator followed
by a proposition. Then symbols representing ‘proposition’ and ‘binary
operator’ would be amongst our non-terminal symbols.
The grammar rules for the language give rules for replacing symbols
by other symbols. For instance, in a natural language we might replace
‘noun phrase’ by ‘article’, ‘adjective’, and ‘noun’. These grammar rules
are called rewriting rules or productions.
When we write the rewriting rules or productions we will write
one symbol followed by another. This indicates the operation of
concatenation. Concatenation is the process of writing two or more
symbols as one.
We carry on using rewriting rules or productions to replace symbols
until we ﬁnd a sequence of symbols that only contains terminal symbols.
Then we have found a sentence.
In order to use the rewriting rules we must have a starting point. The
starting point of the grammar is called the initial or start symbol. This is
a symbol which represents an entire sentence. For a computer program it
would represent the whole program.
We can now state that a grammar consists of four things:
1.
A set of terminal symbols.
2.
A set of non-terminal symbols.
3.
A set of rewriting rules or productions. Every rule has a left-hand side
and right-hand side. The meaning of a rule is that you can substitute
its right-hand side for its left-hand side.
4.
A designated start symbol.
TLFeBOOK

Language theory
481
Terminal symbols are often represented by lowercase letters and
non-terminal symbols by uppercase letters.
A sentence is grammatical if it can be produced by a series of rewritings
such that
1.
It starts with the start symbol.
2.
It uses grammar rules to get from one rewriting to the next.
3.
It does not contain any non-terminals.
A grammar rule or production is a pair of strings of terminal and
non-terminal symbols (P, Q). P is called the left-hand side of the rule
and Q the right-hand side. This means that P may be replaced by Q. This
is often represented as
P→Q
A derivation, of one string of symbols, Y, from another string of sym-
bols, X, is a sequence of application of productions which derives one
string from another. If Y can be derived from X then we can write X⇒∗Y.
The notation ‘⇒∗’ indicates zero or more steps and ‘⇒’ indicates a
single step.
A string of terminal symbols is a sentence if it can be derived from the
start symbol.
Example 20.1
A language, L, over the symbols a and b, is deﬁned by
the following grammar rules, where S is the start symbol.
S→aSb
S→ab
Find a deﬁnition of the set L.
Solution
We start with the symbol S and use either one of the grammar
rules to make a replacement. We choose the rule
S→aSb
to get
S⇒aSb
Using the rule S→aSb again to give
S⇒aSb⇒aaSbb
continuing using the same rule and we can see that we get
S⇒∗an−1S bn−1
after n−1 applications of the rule. Here, an−1 has been used as shorthand
for the repetition of ‘a’ n-1 times. There is still at least one non-terminal
symbol in the right-hand side. We would need to use the second rule
S→ab
to obtain
S⇒∗anbn
We can see that the language consists of a number of ‘a’s followed by the
same number of ‘b’s and so
L = {anbn where n > 0}.
TLFeBOOK

482
Language theory
Example 20.2
The language of the Boolean expressions over the set
{0,1} with the binary operations of + and · with brackets, (,), can be
deﬁned with the following grammar rules
S →(S)B(S)
S →(S)
S →NBN
S →(S)BN
S →NB(S)
S →N
N →0
N →1
B →+
B →·
(a) Show that 1 · 10 is not a sentence.
(b) Show that (1 · 1) is a sentence.
Solution
(a) We will ﬁnd all the sentences of four terminal symbols. To
do this, we repeatedly use the given grammar rules. For convenience, we
can summarize the grammar rules by using ‘|’ to represent ‘or’. Then we
can combine rules with the same left-hand side as follows:
S →(S)B(S) | (S)BN | NB(S) | (S) | NBN | N
N →0 | 1
B →+ | ·
As none of the production rules have more symbols on the left than on
the right and as we are looking for sentences of four terminal symbols,
we only need to consider production rules with up to four symbols on the
right-hand side. For this reason we only need to consider:
S →(S) | NBN | N
N →0 | 1
B →+ | ·
Substituting + or · for B and 0 or 1 for N in S →NBN gives the following
derivations:
S ⇒∗0 + 0
S ⇒∗0 + 1
S ⇒∗1 + 0
S ⇒∗1 + 1
S ⇒∗0 · 0
S ⇒∗0 · 1
S ⇒∗1 · 0
S ⇒∗1 · 1
Substituting for B and N in S →N gives the following derivations:
S ⇒∗0
S ⇒∗1
If we start with the production S →(S) and then apply S →NBN to give
S ⇒∗(NBN) we can substitute for NBN as found above which gives:
S ⇒∗(0 + 0)
S ⇒∗(0 + 1)
S ⇒∗(1 + 0)
S ⇒∗(1 + 1)
S⇒∗(0 · 0)
S⇒∗(0 · 1)
S⇒∗(1 · 0)
S⇒∗(1 · 1)
TLFeBOOK

Language theory
483
Similarly, we can start with S →(S) and then substitute S →N followed
by N →0 or N →1, to give:
S⇒∗(0)
S⇒∗(1)
So the language consists of only the following sentences of length less
than or equal to 4
0 + 0
0 + 1
1 + 0
1 + 1
0 · 0
0 · 1
1 · 0
1 · 1
0
1
(0)
(1)
We can see that the string 1 · 10 does not appear in this list of sentences
and so 1 · 10 is not a sentence.
(b) To show that (1.1) is a sentence we need to look at sentences of ﬁve
symbols. In our solution to (a) we already found (1.1) to be a sentence
as we derived S⇒∗(1.1) by using S →(S) followed by S →NBN with
N replaced by ‘1’ on both occurrences and B replaced by ‘·’ So we have
the derivation S⇒(S)⇒(NBN)⇒(1.1). We have shown that S⇒∗(1.1).
This string contains only terminal symbols and therefore (1.1) is a
sentence.
Context-free languages
Formal grammars were studied by a linguist, Noam Chomsky, in the
1950s. Chomsky proposed a classiﬁcation of grammars of which the most
important classiﬁcation, for our current interest, is that of context-free
languages. Grammars that allow only a single non-terminal and nothing
else on the left-hand side of the rule are called context free.
Chomsky proposed a transformation procedure to transform gram-
mars of context-free languages to Chomsky Normal Form. His work
inﬂuenced John Backus, who realized that programming languages are
mostly context free. He used context-free grammars to describe the syn-
tax of programs, and developed what is now called ‘Backus Normal
Form’ or ‘Backus Naur Form’. It has since been further revised and
extended so nowadays programming language speciﬁcations are written
in EBNF, Extended Backus-Naur Form. Before looking at EBNF we look
at derivation graphs and derivation trees.
20.3
Derivations and
derivation trees
A derivation can be represented using a digraph. We draw a vertex for the
start symbol, a vertex for each production at each step of the derivation
and a vertex for each symbol on the right-hand side of each step of the
derivation. The following example is for a context-sensitive language.
Example 20.3
A language is deﬁned over the symbols {a,b} with the
following productions (labelled r1–r5):
r1 : S →SBba
r2 : bBa →aAb

Represent the derivation
S⇒SBba⇒SbBaa⇒SaAba⇒bBaAba
as a digraph.
Solution
We draw a digraph with a vertex for the start symbol, for each
production used and for each symbol on the right-hand side of each step
of the derivation. The productions used in this case are
S ⇒SBba
Using r1
SBba ⇒SbBaa
Using r4
SbBaa ⇒SaAba
Using r2
SaAba ⇒bBaAba
Using r5
This is represented as a digraph in Figure 20.1.
Context-free grammars have a single symbol on the left-hand side of
each production. In this case the derivation graph is always a derivation
tree. We do not need to include a vertex for each rule, but just for the start
symbol and for each symbol on the right-hand side of each step of the
derivation.

Using the grammar of Example 20.1:
S →(S)B(S) | (S)BN | NB(S) | (S) | NBN | N
N →0 | 1

draw the derivation tree for

Solution
The derivation is as follows:
S ⇒(S)
(S) ⇒(NBN)
(NBN) ⇒(1 · 1)
The derivation tree is shown in Figure 20.2.
We are able to show that the derivation of a context-free grammar can
be represented as a derivation tree. However, we want to efﬁciently solve
the problem of deciding whether a particular string is a sentence in a
context-free language. At the end of Chapter 19, we looked at DFSRs
as an example of the use of state transition diagrams. These are able to
decide whether a string is a sentence in some regular language. Regular
languages are a sub-class of context-free languages where the right-hand
side of all productions are of the form of either a single terminal or
a terminal followed by a non-terminal. These languages are useful for
deﬁning the syntax of regular expressions but are not powerful enough to
be used to deﬁne the syntax of a programming language. To build a parser
for a context-free language we use the idea of a pushdown recognizer.
This is a machine with a ﬁnite number of states, as before, but it also
has the use of a stack. A stack can be compared to a stack of plates.
You can only place plates on the top of the stack, when the operation is
called pushing, and remove them again from the top, called popping. The
TLFeBOOK

bottom of the pile is inaccessible. In this way, any number of symbols
can be pushed onto the top of the stack. When they are popped off again
the last one pushed will be the ﬁrst one popped. Stacks are often referred
to as LIFOs (last in, ﬁrst out).
Efﬁcient parsers can be written if the grammar of the context-free
language is converted to Extended Backus-Naur Form.
20.4 Extended
Backus-Naur
Form (EBNF)
Any grammar in EBNF is context-free. Each rule of the grammar deﬁnes
one symbol of the form.
symbol ::= expression
In the above symbol and expression are non-terminals and represent
syntactic categories. Terminal symbols, or string literals, are given inside
quotes, for example “string” or ‘string’ is a literal string as given inside
the quotes. Brackets (. . .) can be used to group constituents.
Symbols may be combined to represent more complex patterns as in
Table 20.1.
Not all grammars can be converted to EBNF and a full description of
methods of conversion, when possible, is outside the scope of this book.
The following procedure works in simple cases.
To convert a grammar to EBNF:
1.
Remove left recursion, that is
N ::= E | NF
replace by N ::= E | EF∗.
We can see that applying the rule N ::= NF twice gives N := NFF.
As this is a recursive rule we can continue applying it any number of
times, giving N ::= NFFF, N ::= NFFFF, N ::= NFFFFF, and so
on. The only way to have a right-hand side which does not include
N, that is, to remove the left recursion is to replace the N by E and
ﬁnally we get N ::= E | EF∗.
2.
Left factor the grammar
N ::= EFG | EF′G
replace by N ::= E(F | F′)G.
3.
If N ::= E is not recursive remove it and replace all occurrences of
N in the grammar with E.

4.
Reduce the grammar until there is a single production rule for each
non-terminal symbol, using optional expressions where necessary.
Example 20.5
Express the grammar of Example 20.1, that is
S →(S)B(S) | (S)BN | NB(S) | (S) | NBN | N
N →0 | 1
B →+ | ·
in EBNF.
Solution
First, we change the notation, using quotes for literals and the
::= instead of →
S ::= “(”S“)”B“(”S“)” | “(”S“)”BN | NB“(”S“)” | “(”S“)” | NBN | N
N ::= “0” | “1”
B ::= “ + ” | “ · ”
There is no left recursion. We left factor the grammar for the ﬁrst
expression and use optional expressions to reduce it to a single production
rule. To do left factoring notice that three productions for S begin “(“S”)”
and another three begin with N so we have:
S ::= “(”S“)”(B(“(”S“)” | N))? | N(B(“(”S“)” | N))?
N ::= “0” | “1”
B ::= “ + ” | “ · ”
where the productions for N and B were already in EBNF.
We can see why this form is easy for a parser to use to develop an
algorithm for checking strings for validity by representing each of the
productions in EBNF as a directed tree so that the grammar forms a forest.
We use a different node for each of the non-terminals in the expression
and join following on non-terminal symbols with arcs. If the production
has one or more terminal symbols then label the arc with the terminal
symbols. The ﬁnal symbol in an expression of the production has a halt
node attached. This is pictured in Figure 20.3.
Strings are checked for validity in the following manner. Start at the
start symbol with an ingoing arc and take a symbol from the left of the
string, which we call ‘t’. If there is an arc marked with ‘t’ then follow
that arc. If not then examine each of the possible nodes at the other end
of an unmarked arc, which we will call N, and check whether ‘t’ would
be accepted by N. To do this use the sub-tree which has a start symbol
N. Continue within that sub-tree until the halt state is reached and then
return to the main sub-tree at our previous position at the node with label
N. Continue in this manner until the string is exhausted or there are no
further legal moves. If, when the string is exhausted, there is an unmarked
arc leading to a halt state or we have already reached a halt state, then the
string is accepted.
Example 20.6
Use Figure 20.3 to show that (1 · 1) is a valid sentence
in the language.
Solution
We begin at the start symbol marked S with an incoming arc.
Take the ﬁrst symbol from “(1·1)” and this is “(”. There is an arc labelled

“(” so we follow that to the node marked S. We enter the sub-graph for
S, back at the original incoming arc, and take the next symbol from the
string “1”. The only possibility is to follow the arc to N. We check that N
will accept “1” by going into its sub-graph. The sub-graph for N has an
arc labelled “1” leading to a halt state and therefore N accepts “1”. We
take the next symbol from the string “·” and move on from N to B. We
check that B accepts “·” which it does because the sub-graph for B has an
arc labelled “·” leading to a halt symbol. We take the next symbol from
the string “1” and move on from B to N. We check that N will accept
“1” by going into its sub-graph. We have now reached a halt state in S
so we have shown that the sub-string “1 · 1” has been accepted by S. We
are back into the main graph at the S node following the “(”. We take the
next symbol from the string “)” and this leads to a halt state. As we have
reached the end of the string we have shown that the string “(1 · 1)” is
accepted.
This parsing algorithm is called LR parsing where LR stands for ‘Left
to Right Rightmost’. This is a bottom-up parsing technique which derives
the parsing tree for a string in reverse, reducing the string by replacing
right-hand sides of a production by its left-hand side until the string has
been reduced to the start symbol of the grammar. This particular example
is LR(1) because it is only ever necessary to lookahead by one symbol in
order to take the decision as to which production should be used for the
reduction.
There are programs that will take a context-free grammar as input
and output the code for the corresponding parser. Such parser genera-
tors are called compiler compilers. Some examples of these are YACC
(Yet Another Compiler Compiler) developed by Bell labs. The GNU
version is called Bison. The Java Compiler Compiler, JavaCC, origi-
nally developed by Sun Microsystems, can be downloaded free from
http://www.webgain.com/products/java_cc/ and runs on most systems.
20.5 Extensible
markup
language (XML)
Embedding mark-up in a document is not a new idea.
Proof-
readers refer to marking up a document in order to indicate the
changes that are to be made.
Using a precise set of symbols
makes the interpretation of the proofreaders instructions much eas-
ier. Early word processing languages made extensive use of mark-up
to deﬁne how the document was to be laid out. Markup became an
expression that entered into almost everyone’s (non-formal) vocabu-
lary with the introduction of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
TLFeBOOK

488
Language theory
which allowed easy exchange of document information over the
Internet which could be displayed by browsers specially built to
interpret HTML.
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a meta-language, a tool for
deﬁning markup languages using tags enclosed in angle brackets < · · · >
to start an element of the language and < / · · · > to close an ele-
ment. The elements may have properties, called attributes, and child
elements. The main reasons for the importance of the development
of XML is:
1.
XML is a tool for deﬁning markup languages.
2.
XML languages can be used to develop standards for the interchange
of data.
3.
There are many XML parsers available which will check an XML
document for well-formedness and validity.
4.
The structure of XML lends itself easily to a tree representation –
showing the derivation tree of the document.
An XML document has an associated deﬁnition of the allowed
elements, element embeddings, that is, the possible parent-child relation-
ships, and attributes. This is called a document type deﬁnition (DTD).
The parser can check any XML document in two possible ways, either
simply for well-formedness or it can also validate it against its DTD. A
well-formed document must follow the general rules for any XML doc-
ument whereas a valid document must also agree with the constraints
deﬁned in its DTD. We give an example here of a well-formed document
and not concern ourselves at present with the structure of a DTD.
We might want to represent the following information about books:
Publisher, Title, Author, ISBN, Category. As all books have a publisher
then we could say that a book is a child of the publisher. In this case, we
could represent some information in the following XML fragment.
<publisher name=“The Book Company”>
<book ISBN=“0–07–707975–2” category=“Engineering
Mathematics”>

This fragment would constitute a well-formed XML document. We have
indented it so it is clear the structure of document. We can see it as a tree
displayed with the root of the tree on the left-hand side – this is pictured
in Figure 20.4.

20.6 Summary
1.
A language is a set of sequences of symbols. A sequence of symbols
is called a string. An element of the language set is called a sentence.
A symbolwhichformspartofasentenceiscalledaterminalsymbol.
2.
Other symbols are used to express the grammar rules for the
language. These symbols are called non-terminal symbols.
3.
A grammar consists of four things:
(a)
A set of terminal symbols.
(b)
A set of non-terminal symbols.
(c)
A set of rewriting rules or productions. Every rule has a left-
hand side and right-hand side. The meaning of a rule is that
you can substitute its right-hand side for its left-hand side.
(d)
A designated start symbol.
4.
A sentence is grammatical if it can be produced by a series of
rewritings such that
(a)
It starts with the start symbol.
(b)
It uses grammar rules to get from one rewriting to the next.
(c)
It does not contain any non-terminals.
5.
A derivation, of one string of symbols, Y, from another string of
symbols, X, is a sequence of applications of productions which
derives one string from another. If Y can be derived from X then we
can write X⇒∗Y. The notation ‘⇒∗’ indicates zero or more steps
and ‘⇒’ indicates a single step.
6.
Grammars that allow only a single non-terminal and nothing else
on the left-hand side of the rule are called context-free.
7.
A derivation can be represented using a digraph. A derivation of a
context-free grammar can be represented as a directed tree called
the derivation tree.
8.
ExtendedBackus-NaurForm(EBNF)isusedtorepresentthesyntax
of programming languages. Any grammar in EBNF is context-free.
This form of a grammar lends itself to the easy development of
a parser to check strings for validity.
9.
To convert a grammar to EBNF then remove left recursion, left
factor the grammar, if a rule N ::= E is not recursive remove it
and replace all occurrences of N in the grammar with E. Reduce the
grammar until there is a single production rule for each non-terminal
symbol, using optional expressions where necessary.

Introduction
Consider a system of computers and communication networks supporting
a bank’s cash dispensing machines. The machines provide instant money
on the street on production of a cash card and a personal identiﬁcation
code with the only prerequisite being that of a positive bank balance.
The communication network must be reliable – that is, not subject too
often to break downs. The reliability of the system, or each part of the
system, will depend on each component part.
A very simple system, with only two components, can be conﬁgured
in series or in parallel. If the components are in series then the system
will fail if one component fails (Figure 21.1).
If the components are in parallel then only one component need func-
tion (Figure 21.2) and we have built in redundancy just in case one of the
components fails.
A network could be made up of tens, hundreds, or even thousands
of components. It is important to be able to estimate the reliability of
a complex system and therefore the rate of replacement of components
necessary and the overall annoyance level of our customers should the
system fail.
The reliability will depend on the reliability of each one of the com-
ponents but it is impossible to say exactly how long even one single
component will last.
We would like to be able to answer questions like:
1.
What is the likely lifetime of any one element of the system?
2.
How can we estimate the reliability of the whole system by
considering the interaction of its component parts?

Probability and statistics
This is just one example of the type of problem for which we need the
ideas of probability and statistics. Others are, a factory produces 1000
electronic components each day where we wish to be able to estimate how
many defective components are produced each day or a company with
eight telephone lines where we wish to say whether that is a sufﬁcient
number, in general, for the number of calls likely to be received at any
one time.
All of these questions are those that need the ideas of probability and
statistics. Statistics is used to analyse data and produce predictions about
it . Probability is the theory upon which statistical models are built.
For the engineering situations in previous chapters we have considered
that we know all the factors that determine how a system will behave, that
is, we have modelled the system deterministically. This is not very realis-
tic. Any real situation will have some random element. Some problems,
as the one we have just introduced, contain a large random element so
that it is difﬁcult to predict the behaviour of each part of the system. How-
ever, it is possible to say, for instance, what the average overall behaviour
would be.
21.2 Population
and sample,
representation
of data, mean,
variance and
standard
deviation
In statistics, we are generally interested in a ‘population’ that is too large
for us to measure completely. For instance, we could be interested in all
the light bulbs that are produced by a certain manufacturer. The manufac-
turer may claim that her light bulbs have a lifetime of 1500 h. Clearly this
cannot be exact but we might be satisﬁed to agree with the manufacturer
if most of the bulbs have a lifetime greater than 1500 h. If the factory
produces half a million light bulbs per year then we do not have the time
to test them all. In this case we test a ‘sample’. The larger the sample, the
more accurate will be the comparison with the whole population.
We have recorded the lifetimes of samples of light bulbs in Table 21.1.
We can build up a table to give information about our sample. Columns 8
and 9 are given for comparison with statistical modelling and columns 4,
6, and 7 are to help with the calculation. The following describes each
column of Table 21.1, beginning with a list of the ‘raw’ data.
Column 1: the class intervals
Find the minimum and the maximum of the data. The difference between
these gives the range of the data. Choose a number of class intervals
(usually up to about 20) so that the class range can be chosen as some
multiple of 10, 100, 1000, etc. (like the class range of 100 above). The
data range divided by the class range and then rounded up to the integer
above gives the number of classes. The class intervals are chosen so that
the lowest class minimum is less than the minimum data value. In our
example, the lowest class minimum has been chosen as 900. Add the class
range of 100 to ﬁnd the class interval, for example, 900–1000. Carry on
adding the class range to ﬁnd the next class interval until you pass the
maximum value.
Column 2: the class midpoint
The class midpoint is found by the maximum value in the class interval –
the minimum value in the class interval divided by 2. For the interval
1300–1400, the class midpoint is (1400 −1300)/2 = 1350.
The class midpoint is taken as a representative value for the class. That
is, for the sake of simplicity we treat the data in the class 1300–1400 as

Probability and statistics
though there were 47 values at 1350. This is an approximation that is not
too serious if the classes are not too wide.
Column 3: class frequency and the
total number in the sample
The class frequency is found by counting the number of data values that
fall within that class range. For instance, there are 47 values between
1300 and 1400. You have to decide whether to include values that fall
exactly on the class boundary in the class above or the class below. It
does not usually matter which you choose as long as you are consistent
within the whole data set.
The total number of values in the sample is given by the sum of the
frequencies for each class interval.
Column 4: fixi and the mean of the
sample, ¯x
This is the product of the frequency and the class midpoint. If the class
midpoint is taken as a representative value for the class then fixi gives
the sum of all the values in that class. For instance, in the eighth class,
with class midpoint 1650, there are 190 values. If we say that each of the
values is approximately 1650 then the total of all the values in that class is
1650×190 = 313 500. Summing this column gives the approximate total
value for the whole sample = 1 682 700 h. If we only used one light bulb
at a time and changed it when it failed then the 1000 light bulbs would last
approximately 1 682 700 h. The mean of the sample is this total divided
by the number in the sample, 1000. Giving 1 682 700/1000 = 1682.7 h.
The mean is a measure of the central tendency. That is, if you wanted a
simple number to sum up the lifetime of these light bulbs you would say
that the average life was 1683 h.
Column 5: the cumulative frequency
The cumulative frequency gives the number that falls into the current
class interval or any class interval that comes before it. You could think
of it as ‘the number so far’ function. To ﬁnd the cumulative frequency
for a class, take the number in the current class and add on the previous
cumulative frequency for the class below, for example, for 1900–2000
we have a frequency of 92. The cumulative frequency for 1800–1900 is
859. Add 859 + 92 to get the cumulative frequency of 951. That is, 951
light bulbs in the sample have a lifetime below 2000 h. Notice that the
cumulative frequency of the ﬁnal class must equal the total number in the
sample. This is because the ﬁnal class must include the maximum value
in the sample and all the others have lifetimes less than this.
Column 6: (xi −¯x)2, the squared
deviation
This column is used in the process of calculating the standard deviation
(see column 7). (xi −¯x) represents the amount that the class midpoint
differs from the mean of the sample. If we want to measure how spread
out around the mean the data are, then this would seem like a useful
number. However, adding up (xi −¯x) for the whole sample will just give
zero, as the positive and negative values will cancel each other. Hence,

we take the square, so that all the numbers are positive. For the sixth class
interval the class midpoint is 1450; subtracting the mean, 1682.7, gives
−232.7, which when squared is 54149.2. This value is the square of the
deviation from the mean, or just the squared deviation.
Column 7: fi(xi −¯x)2, the variance and
the standard deviation
For each class we multiply the frequency by the squared deviation, cal-
culated in column 6. This gives an approximation to the total squared
deviation for that class. For the sixth class we multiply the squared devia-
tion of 54 149 by the frequency 103 to get 5 577 347. The sum of this
column gives the total squared deviation from the mean for the whole
sample. Dividing by the number of sample points gives an idea of the
average squared deviation. This is called the variance. It is found by sum-
ming column 7 and dividing by 1000, the number in the sample, giving a
variance of 39 120. A better measure of the spread of the data is given by
the square root of this number, called the standard deviation and usually
represented by σ. Here σ =
√
39 120 ≈198.
Column 8: the relative frequency
If instead of 1000 data values in the sample we had 2000, 10 000, or 500,
we might expect that the proportion falling into each class interval would
remain roughly the same. This proportion of the total number is called
the relative frequency and is found by dividing the frequency by the total
number in the sample. Hence, for the third class, 1100–1200, we ﬁnd
5/1000 = 0.005.
Column 9: the cumulative relative
frequency
By the same argument as above we would expect the proportion with a
lifetime of less than 1900 h to be roughly the same whatever the sample
size. This cumulative relative frequency can be found by dividing the
cumulative frequency by the number in the sample. Notice that the cumu-
lative relative frequency for the ﬁnal class interval is 1. That is, the whole
of the sample has a lifetime of less than 2000 h.
The data can be represented in a histogram as in Figure 21.3, which
gives a simple pictorial representation of the data. The right-hand side
has a scale equal to the left-hand scale divided by the number in the
sample. These readings, therefore, give the relative frequencies and the
cumulative relative frequency as given in Table 21.1.
We may want to sum up our ﬁndings with a few simple statistics.
To do this we use a measure of the central tendency and the dispersion
of the data, which are calculated as already described above. These are
summarized below.

Hence, the standard deviation is

Can we agree with the manufacturer’s claim that the light bulbs have a
lifetime of 1500 h? The number with a lifetime of less than 1500 h is 180
(the cumulative frequency up to 1500 h). This represents only 0.18, less
than 20% of the sample. However, this is probably an unreasonable num-
ber to justify the manufacturers claim as nearly 20% of the customers will
get light bulbs that are not as good as advertised. We might accept a small
number, say 5%, failing to live up to a manufacturer’s promise. Hence,
it would be better to claim a lifetime of around 1350 h with a relative
cumulative frequency between 0.03 and 0.077. Approximately 0.053 or
just over 5% would fail to live up to the manufacturer’s amended claim.

Group the data in class intervals and represent it using a table and a
histogram. Calculate the mean resistance and the standard deviation.
Solution
We follow the method of building up the table as described
previously.
Column 1: class intervals. To decide on class intervals look at the range
of values presented. The minimum value is 1995 and the maximum is
2006. A reasonable number of class intervals would be around 10, and in
this case as the data are presented to the nearest whole number, the small-
est possible class range we could choose would be 1 
. A 1-
 class range
would give 12 classes, which seems a reasonable choice. If we choose
the class midpoints to be the integer values then we get class intervals of
1994.5–1995.5, 1995.5–1996.5, etc. We can now produce Table 21.2.

The other columns are ﬁlled in as follows:
Column 2. To ﬁnd the frequency, count the number of data values in
each class interval. The sum of the frequencies gives the total number in
the sample; in this case 100.
Column 3. The cumulative frequency is given by adding up the fre-
quencies so far. The number of resistances up to 1995.5 is 1. As there
are three in the interval 1995.5–1996.5, add 1 + 3 = 4 to get the num-
ber up to a resistance of 1996.5. The number up to 1997.6 is given by
4 + 5 = 9, etc.
Column’s 4, 6, and 7 help us calculate the mean and standard devia-
tion. To ﬁnd column 4 multiply the frequencies (column 3) by the class
midpoints (column 2) to get fixi.
The sum of this column is an estimate of the total if we added all the
values in the sample together. Therefore, dividing by the number of items
in the sample gives the mean:
Mean = (1 × 1995 + 3 × 1996 + 5 × 1997 + 13 × 1998
+ 17 × 1999 + 19 × 2000 + 16 × 2001 + 15 × 2002
+ 4 × 2003 + 4 × 2004 + 2 × 2005 + 1 × 2006)/100
= 200 015/100 = 2000.15.
To ﬁnd the standard deviation we calculate the variance ﬁrst. The variance
is the mean squared deviation. Find the difference between the mean and
each of the class intervals and square it. This gives column 6. Multiply by
the class frequency to get column 7. Finally, add them all up and divide
by the total number. This gives the variance:
σ 2 = 446.5
100 = 4.465
and the standard deviation
σ =
√
446.5 ≈2.11.
The relative frequency (given in column 8) is the fraction in each
class interval; that is, the frequency divided by the total number. For
example, the relative frequency in the class interval 2000.5–2001.5 is
16/100 = 0.16
The cumulative relative frequency is the cumulative frequency divided
by the total number n. The cumulative frequency up to 2000.5 is 58.
Divided by the total number gives 0.58 for the relative cumulative
frequency.
We can sum up this sample by saying that the mean resistance is
2000.15 with a standard deviation of 2.11. These simple ﬁgures can be
used to sum up how closely the claim that they are resistors of 2000
can be justiﬁed. We can also picture the frequency distribution using a
histogram as in Figure 21.4
Returning to the lifetimes of the light bulbs we might want to ask what
average lifetime and standard deviation might lead to less than 5% of the
light bulbs having a lifetime less than 1500 h?
To answer this sort of problem we need to build up a theory of statistical
models and use probability theory.
21.3 Random
systems and
probability
We are dealing with complicated systems with a number of random fac-
tors affecting its behaviour; for instance, those that we have already
seen, production of resistors, lifetimes of bulbs. We cannot determine
the exact behaviour of the system but using its frequency distribution we
can estimate the probabilities of certain events.
TLFeBOOK

502
Probability and statistics
Figure 21.4
Histogram of the frequency distribution of the resistances given in Table 21.2.
Relative frequency and probability
The probability of an event is related to its relative frequency. If I chose
a light bulb from the sample in Section 21.2, then the probability of its
lifetime being between 1400 and 1500 h is 0.103. This is the same as the
relative frequency for that class interval, that is, the number in the class
interval divided by the total number of light bulbs in the sample. Here,
we have assumed that we are no more likely to pick any one light bulb
than any other, that is, each outcome is equally likely. The histogram of
the relative frequencies (Figure 21.3 using the right-hand scale) gives the
probability distribution function (or simply the probability function) for
the lifetimes of the sample of light bulbs.
As an introduction to probability, examples are often quoted involving
throwing dice or dealing cards from a pack of playing cards. These are
used because the probabilities of events are easy to justify and not because
of any particular predilection on the part of mathematicians to a gambling
vocation!
Example 21.2
A die has the numbers one to six marked on its sides.
Draw a graph of the probability distribution function for the outcome
from one throw of the die, assuming it is fair.
Solution
If we throw the die 10 000 times we would expect the number
of times each number appeared face up to be roughly the same. Here, we
have assumed that the die is fair; that is, any one number is as likely to
be thrown as any other. The relative frequencies would be approximately
1/6. The probability distribution function, therefore, is a ﬂat function with
a value of 1/6 for each of the possible outcomes of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This is
shown in Figure 21.5
Notice two important things about the probabilities in the probability
distribution for the die:
1.
each probability is less than 1;
2.
the sum of all the probabilities is 1:
1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1.
Example 21.3
A pack of cards consists of four suits, hearts, diamonds,
spades, and clubs. Each suit has 13 cards; that is, cards for the numbers
1 (the ace) to 10 and a Jack, Queen, and King. Draw a graph of the
probability distribution function for the outcome when dealing one card

fromthepack, whereonlythesuitisrecorded. Assumethecardisreplaced
each time and the pack is perfectly shufﬂed.
Solution
If a card is selected, the suit recorded hearts, spades, clubs, or
diamonds, the card is placed back in the pack and the pack is shufﬂed.
If this is repeated (say 10 000 times) then we might expect that each suit
will occur as often as any other, that is, 1/4 of the time. The probability
distribution function again is a ﬂat distribution, and has the value of 1/4
for each of the possible four outcomes. The probability distribution for
suits is given in Figure 21.6.
Notice again that in Example 21.3 each probability is less than 1 and
that the sum of all the probabilities is 1:
1
4 + 1
4 + 1
4 + 1
4 = 1.
We have seen that a probability distribution can be represented using a
graph. Each item along the x-axis has an associated probability. Prob-
ability is a function deﬁned on some set. The set is called the sample
space, S, and contains all possible outcomes of the random system. The
probability distribution function is often abbreviated to p.d.f.
Some deﬁnitions
A trial is a single observation on the random system, for example,
one throw of a die, one measurement of a resistance in the example
in Section 21.2.
The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes, for example, for
the die it is the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and for the resistance problem it is
the set of all possible measured resistances. This set may be discrete or
continuous. An event is a set of outcomes. For instance, A is the event
of throwing less than 4 and B is the event of throwing a number greater
than or equal to 5.
An event is a subset of the sample space S.
TLFeBOOK

504
Probability and statistics
Notice that in the case of a continuous sample space an event is also
a continuous set, represented by an interval of values. For example, C is
the event that the resistance lies in the interval 2000 ± 1.5.
Probability
The way that probability is deﬁned is slightly different for the case of a
discrete sample space or a continuous sample space.
Discrete sample space
The outcome of any trial is uncertain; however, in a large number of trials
the proportion showing a particular outcome approaches a certain number.
We call this the probability of that outcome. The probability distribution
function, or simply probability function, gives the value of the probability
that is associated with each outcome. The probability function obeys two
important conditions:
1.
all probabilities are less than, or equal to 1, that is, 0 ⩽p(x) ⩽1,
where x is any outcome in the sample space;
2.
the probabilities of the individual outcomes sum to 1, that is,
 p(x) = 1.
Continuous sample space
Considering a continuous sample space. We assign probabilities to inter-
vals. We ﬁnd the probability of, for instance, the resistance being in the
interval 2000 ± 0.5. Hence, we assign probabilities to events and not to
individual outcomes. In this case, the function that gives the probabilities
is called the probability density function and we can ﬁnd the probability of
some event by integrating the probability density function over the inter-
val. For instance, if we have a probability density function f (x), where
x can take values from a continuous sample space, then the probability
of x being in the interval a to b is given by, for example,
P(a < x < b) =
 b
a
f (x) dx.
The probability density function obeys the condition:
 ∞
−∞
f (x) dx = 1
that is, the total area under the graph of the probability density function
must be 1.
Equally likely events
If all outcomes are equally likely then the probability of an event E from
a discrete sample set is given by
The number of outcomes in E
The total number of outcomes in S.
TLFeBOOK

Probability and statistics
505
That is, the probability of E is equal to the proportion of the whole sample
space that is in E, when each of the outcomes are equally likely.
Example 21.4
What is the probability on one throw of a die getting a
number less than 3?
Solution
Give this event the name A. Then A = {1, 2} and S =
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The number in A is 2 and the number in S is 6. There-
fore, as each outcomes is equally likely, p(A), the probability of A is
2/6 = 1/3.
This particular result leads to another way of representing probability –
by using area.
If we use a rectangle to represent the set of all possible outcomes, S,
then an event is a subset of S, that is, one section of the rectangle and if
all outcomes are equally likely then its probability can be pictured by the
proportion of S that is in A. We will put a dotted line around the picture
representing the set A to indicate the number in A or the area of A (see
Figure 21.7).
Figure 21.7
A ⊆S (A is a
subset of S) where all the
outcomes in S are equally
likely. The probability of A can
be pictured as the proportion
of S than is in A: the ratios of
the areas.
This way of picturing the probability of an event can help in
remembering some of the probabilities of combined events.
21.4 Addition
law of
probability
Disjoint events
Disjoint events are events with no outcomes in common. They cannot
happen simultaneously.
Example 21.5
A is the event that a card chosen from a playing pack is
under 6 (counting ace as low, i.e. = 1) and B is the event of choosing
a picture card (Jack, Queen, or King). Find the probability that a card
chosen from the pack is under 6 or is a picture card.
Solution
A = {1n, 2n, 3n, 4n, 5n, 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o, 5o, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m,
1p, 2p, 3p, 4p, 5p}
B = {Jn, Qn, Kn, Jo, Qo, Ko, Jm, Qm, Km, Jp, Qp, Kp}.
A and B are disjoint. As each outcome is considered to be equally likely
the probabilities are easy to ﬁnd:
p(A) = Number in A
Number in S .
There are 52 cards; therefore, 52 possible outcomes in S, so
p(A) = 20
52 = 5
13.
Also
p(B) = Number in B
Number in S = 12
52 = 3

p(A ∪B) = Number in A ∪B
Number in S
= 32
52 = 8

Number in A + number in B
Number in S
= Number in A
Number in S + Number in B
Number in S
p(A ∪B) = p(A) + p(B)

13 = 5
13 + 3
13.
We can also see this by using the idea of area to picture it, as in Figure 21.8.
We can also consider the probability of A not happening; that is, the
probability of the complement of A, which we represent by A′. As A and
A′ are disjoint.
p(A′) + p(A) = 1
p(A′) = 1 −p(A).
This is shown in Figure 21.9.

21.5 Repeated
trials,
outcomes, and
probabilities
Supposing we start to consider more complicated situations, like throw-
ing a die twice. Then the outcomes can be found by considering all the
possible outcomes of throwing the die the ﬁrst time combined with all
the possible outcomes of throwing the die the second time. As there are
six possible outcomes for the ﬁrst throw and six possible outcomes for
the second throw, then there are 6 × 6 = 36 outcomes of throwing the
die twice.
If we would like to ﬁnd the probability that the ﬁrst throw is a 5 and the
second throw is a 5 or 6 then we can do this by listing all the 36 outcomes
and ﬁnding the proportion that fall into our event.
The set S of all possible outcomes has 36 elements:
S = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4),
(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2),
(4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6),
(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)}
and each has an equally likely outcome. E = the ﬁrst throw is a 5 and the
second is a 5 or 6. Hence
E = {(5, 5), (5, 6)}
p(E) = Number in A
Number in S = 2
36 = 1
18.
This sort of problem can be pictured more easily using a probability tree.
21.6 Repeated
trials and
probability trees
Repeatedly tossing a coin
The simplest sort of trial to consider is one with only two outcomes;
for instance, tossing a coin. Each trial has the outcome of head or tail
and each is equally likely.
We can picture repeatedly tossing the coin by drawing a probability
tree. The tree works by drawing all the outcomes and writing the proba-
bilities for the trial on the branches. Let us consider tossing a coin three
times. The probability tree for this is shown in Figure 21.11.
There are various rules and properties we can notice.
Rules of probability trees and
repeated trials
1.
The probabilities of outcomes associated with each of the vertices
can be found by multiplying all the probabilities along the branches
leading to it from the top of the tree. HTH has the probability
1
2 × 1
2 × 1
2 = 1
8
2.
At each level of the tree, the sum of all the probabilities on the vertices
must be 1.
3.
The probabilities along branches out of a single vertex must sum to 1.
Forexample, aftergettingaheadontheﬁrsttrialwehaveaprobability
of 1/2 of getting a head on the second trial and a probability of 1/2
of getting a tail. Together they sum to 1.

Figure 21.11
A probability tree for three tosses of a coin.
The fourth property is one that is only true when the various repeated
trials are independent, that is, the result of the ﬁrst trial has no effect on
the possible result of the second trial, etc.
4.
For independent trials, the tree keeps repeating the same structure
with the same probabilities associated with the branches. Here, the
event of getting a head on the third toss is independent of the event
of getting a head on the ﬁrst or second toss.
Using the tree we can ﬁnd various probabilities,
as we see in
Example 21.7.
Example 21.7
What is the probability on three tosses of the coin that
exactly two of them will be heads?
Solution
Count up all the ways that we could have two heads and one
tail, looking at the foot of the probability tree in Figure 21.11. We ﬁnd
three possibilities:
HHT, HTH, THH
each of these has probability of 1
8. Therefore, the probability of exactly
two heads is 3
8.
Picking balls from a bag without
replacement
We have 20 balls in a bag. Ten are red and ten are black. A ball is picked
out of the bag, its colour recorded and then it is not replaced into the bag.
There are two possible outcomes of each trial, red (R) or black (B). Let us
consider three trials and their associated outcomes in a probability tree,
as shown in Figure 21.12.
To ﬁnd the probabilities we consider how many balls remain in each
case. Iftheﬁrstballchosenisredthenthereareonly19ballsleftofwhich9
are red and 10 are black; therefore, the probability of picking a red ball on
the second trial is only 9/19 and the probability of picking black is 10/19.
TLFeBOOK

Probability and statistics
Figure 21.12
Probability tree for three trials of picking a ball out of a bag without replacement.
The ﬁrst three rules given in the last example apply.
1.
The probabilities of outcomes associated with each of the vertices
can be found by multiplying all the probabilities along the branches
leading to it from the top of the tree. BRB has the probability:
10
20 × 10
19 × 9
18 = 900
6840 = 1
76.
2.
At each level of the tree the sum of all the probabilities on the vertices
must be 1; for example, at the second level we have
90
380 + 100
380 + 100
380 + 90
380 = 9 + 10 + 10 + 9
38
= 38
38 = 1.
3.
The probabilities along branches out of a single vertex must sum to 1;
for example, after picking red on the ﬁrst trial we have a probability
of 9/19 of picking red and 10/19 of picking black. Together they sum
to 1.
The fourth property is no longer true as the various repeated trials are
not independent. The result of the ﬁrst trial has an effect on the possible
result of the second trial, etc.
Using the tree we can ﬁnd the probability of various events as in
Example 21.8.
Example 21.8
Of 20 balls in a bag 10 are red and 10 are black. A ball
is picked out of the bag, its colour recorded and then it is not replaced
into the bag. What is the probability that of the ﬁrst three balls chosen
exactly two will be red?
Solution
We can use the probability tree in Figure 21.12 to solve this
problem. We look at the foot of the tree, which gives all the possible
outcomes after three balls have been selected.
The ways of getting two red are RRB, RBR, BRR and the associated
probabilities are
900
6840, 900
6840, 900
6840
or
10
76, 10
76, 10
76.
Summing these gives the probability of exactly two reds being chosen
out of the three as 30/76.

Conditional
probability and
probability trees
The probabilities we have been writing along the branches of the
probability tree are called conditional probabilities.
Example 21.9
What is the probability that the ﬁrst throw of a die will
be a 5 and the second throw will be a 5 or 6?
Solution
A is the set of those outcomes with the ﬁrst throw a 5 and B
is the set of those outcomes with the second throw a 5 or 6. We can use a
probability tree in the following way. After the ﬁrst throw of the die either
A is true or not, that is, we have only two possibilities, A or A′. After
that, we are interested in whether B happens or not. Again we either get
B or B′. We get the probability tree as in Figure 21.13.
Here, p(B|A) means the probability of B given A, similarly p(B|A′)
means the probability of B given (not A). We can ﬁll in the probabilities
using our knowledge of the fair die. The probability of A is 1/6. The
second throw of the die is unaffected by the throw ﬁrst throw of the die;
therefore
p(B) = p(throwing a 5 or a 6 on one throw of the die) = 2
6 = 1
3.
Working out the other probabilities gives the probability tree in
Figure 21.14.
The probability that the ﬁrst throw of a die will be a 5 and the second
throw will be a 5 or 6 is p(B ∩A), given from the tree in Figure 21.14 as
2
6 × 1
3 = 1
18.
Notice that the probability we have calculated is the intersection of the two
events A and B, that is, we calculated the probability that both occurred.
When multiplying the probabilities on the branches of the probability tree
we are using the following:
p(A ∩B) = p(A)p(B|A).
Furthermore, because of independence we have used the fact that
p(B|A) = p(B). That is, the probability of B does no depend on whether
A has happened or not: B is independent of A. We, therefore, have the
following important results.

Probability tree for Example 21.10.
Multiplication law of probability
p(A ∩B) = p(A)p(B|A)
This law applies for any two events A and B. It is the law used in ﬁnding
the probabilities of the vertices of the probability trees.
Example 21.10
It is known that 10% of a selection of 100 elec-
trical components are faulty. What is the probability that the ﬁrst
two components selected are faulty if the selection is made without
replacement?
Solution
The probability we are looking for is:
p(ﬁrst faulty ∩second faulty)
= p(ﬁrst faulty)p(second faulty | ﬁrst faulty)
Here there are only two possibilities at each stage, faulty or not faulty.
The probability tree is as shown in Figure 21.15.
Notice that their are only 99 components left after the ﬁrst trial and
whether the ﬁrst was faulty or not changed the probability that the second
is faulty or otherwise. Each branch of the tree, after the ﬁrst layer,
represents a conditional probability.
The answer to our problem is therefore
p(ﬁrst faulty ∩second faulty)
= p(ﬁrst faulty)p(second faulty | ﬁrst faulty)
= 10
100 × 9
99 =
1
110.
Condition of independence
If two events A and B are independent then
p(B|A) = p(B).
Noticethatthemultiplicationlawchangesinthiscase, asdescribedbelow.
Multiplication law of probability for
independent events
p(A ∩B) = p(A)p(B).
There is one other much-quoted law of probability that completes all the
basic laws from which probabilities can be worked out. That is Bayes’s
theorem and it comes from the multiplication law.
TLFeBOOK

Probability and statistics
513
Bayes’s theorem
As p(A ∩B) = p(A)p(B|A) then as A ∩B = B ∩A we can also
write p(B ∩A) = p(B)p(A|B) and putting the two together gives
p(A)p(B|A) = p(B)p(A|B) or
p(B|A) = p(A|B)p(B)
p(A)
.
Bayes’s theorem is important because it gives a way of swapping condi-
tional probabilities that may be useful in diagnostic situations where not
all of the conditional probabilities can be found directly.
Example 21.11
In a certain town there are only two brands of ham-
burgers available, Brand A and Brand B. It is known that people who eat
Brand A hamburger have a 30% probability of suffering stomach pain and
those who eat Brand B hamburger have a 25% probability of suffering
stomach pain. Twice as many people eat Brand B compared to Brand A
hamburgers. However, no one eats both varieties. Supposing one day you
meet someone suffering from stomach pain who has just eaten a ham-
burger, what is the probability that they have eaten Brand A and what is
the probability that they have eaten, Brand B?
Solution
First we deﬁne the sample space S, and the other simple events.
S = people who have just eaten a hamburger
A = people who have eaten a Brand A hamburger
B = people who have eaten a Brand B hamburger
C = people who are suffering stomach pains
We are given that:
p(A) = 1
3
p(B) = 2
3
p(C|A) = 0.3
p(C|B) = 0.25.
Note also that S = A ∪B.
As those who have stomach pain have either eaten Brand A or B,
then A ∩B = ∅
p(C) = p(C ∩S) = p(C ∩A) + p(C ∩B)
= p(C|A)p(A) + p(C|B)p(B)
= 0.3 × 1
3 + 0.25 × 2
3 = 8
30.
Then
p(A|C) = p(C|A)p(A)
p(C)
= 0.3 × (1/3)
8/30
= 3
8
and
p(B|C) = p(C|B)p(B)
p(C)
= 0.25 × (2/3)
8/30
= 5
8.
Hence, if they have stomach pain the probability that they have eaten
Brand A is 3/8 and the probability that they have eaten Brand B is 5/8.

Application of
the probability
laws to the
probability of
failure of an
electrical circuit
Components in series
We denote ‘The probability that A does not fail’ as p(A). Then the
probability that S fails is p(S′) = 1 −p(S).
As they are in series (see Figure 21.16), S will function if both A and
B function: S = A ∩B. Therefore
p(S) = p(A ∩B)
as A and B are independent
p(S) = p(A)p(B)
p(S′) = 1 −p(A)p(B).
Example 21.12
An electrical circuit has three components in series (see
Figure 21.17). One has a probability of failure within the time of operation
of the system of 1/5; the other has been found to function on 99% of
occasions and the third component has proved to be very unreliable with
a failure once for every three successful runs. What is the probability that
the system will fail on a single operation run.
Solution
Using the method of reasoning above we call the components
A, B, and C. The information we have is
p(A′) = 1
5
p(B) = 0.99
p(C′):p(C) = 1 : 3.
The probability we would like to ﬁnd is p(S′), the probability of failure
of the system and we know that the system is in series so S = A ∩B ∩C;
that is, all the components must function for the system to function. We
can ﬁnd the probability that the system will function and subtract it from
1 to ﬁnd the probability of failure:
p(S′) = 1 −p(S).
As all the components are independent,
p(A ∩B ∩C) = p(A)p(B)p(C).
We can ﬁnd p(A), p(B), and p(C) from the information we are given:
p(A) = 1 −p(A′) = 1 −1/5 = 0.8 and p(B) is given as 0.99.
Given that p(C′) : p(C) = 1 : 3, C fails once in every 1+3 occasions,
so p(C′) = 1/4 = 0.25 and p(C) = 1 −p(C′) = 0.75.
We can now ﬁnd p(A)p(B)p(C) = 0.8 × 0.99 × 0.75 = 0.594. This
is the probability that the system will function, so the probability it will
fail is given by 1 −0.594 = 0.406.

Components in parallel
If a system S consists of two components A and B in parallel, as in
Figure 21.18, then S fails if both A and B fail.
Figure 21.18
Two
components in parallel. S fails
if both A and B fail.
Again denote ‘The probability that A does not fail’ as p(A). Then the
probability that S fails is
p(S′) = 1 −p(S).
As they are in parallel, S will function if either A or B functions: S =
A ∪B. Therefore
p(S) = p(A ∪B).
A and B are independent, but not disjoint. They are not disjoint because
both A and B can function simultaneously. From the addition law of
probabilities given in Section 21.4
p(A ∪B) = p(A) + p(B) −p(A ∩B).
As A and B are independent,
p(A ∩B) = p(A)p(B).
Therefore
p(S) = p(A ∪B) = p(A) + p(B) −p(A)p(B)
p(S′) = 1 −(p(A) + p(B) −p(A)p(B))
= 1 −p(A) −p(B) + p(A)p(B).
As this is a long-winded expression it may be more useful to look at the
problem the other way round. S fails only if both A and B fail: S′ =
A′ ∩B′. So
p(S′) = p(A′ ∩B′) = p(A′)p(B′)
as A and B are independent. Finally, p(S′) = p(A′)p(B′).
This is a simpler form that we may use in preference to the previous
expression we derived. It must be equivalent to our previous result, so we
should just check that by substituting p(A′) = 1 −p(A) and p(B′) =
1 −p(B). Hence
p(S′) = p(A′)p(B′)
p(S′) = (1 −p(A))(1 −p(B))
p(S′) = 1 −p(A) −p(B) + p(A)p(B)
which is the same as we had before.
Let us try a mixed example with some components in series and others
in parallel.
Example 21.13
An electrical circuit has three components, two in par-
allel, components A and B, and one in series, component C. They are
arranged as in Figure 21.19. Component’s A and B are identical com-
ponents with a 2/3 probability of functioning and C has a probability of
failure of 0.1%. Find the probability that the system fails.
TLFeBOOK

Figure 21.19

We denote ‘The probability that A functions’ as p(A).
The information we have is
p(A) = 2
3
p(B) = 2
3
p(C′) = 0.001
⇒
p(C) = 0.999.
The probability we would like to ﬁnd is p(S′), the probability of failure
of the system and we know that the system will function if (either A or
B function) and C functions. So
S = (A ∪B) ∩C.
From the multiplication law for independent events we have:
p((A ∪B) ∩C) = p(A ∪B)p(C).
From the addition law for non-disjoint events (A and B are not disjoint
because both A and B can occur), we have:
p(A ∪B) = p(A) + p(B) −p(A)p(B)
p(A ∪B) = 2
3 + 2
3 −2
3 × 2
3 = 8
9 ≈0.8889.
So p(S) = p(A ∪B)p(C) = 0.8889 × 0.999 = 0.888. Hence, the
probability that the system functions is 0.888.
21.9 Statistical
modelling
Suppose, as in Example 21.2, we have tested 5000 resistors and recorded
the resistance of each one to an accuracy of 0.01
. We may wish to
quickly decide whether the manufacturers claim of producing 2000-
resistors is correct. One way of doing this is to divide our resistors into
class intervals and draw up a table and a histogram. We can then count the
percentage of resistors that are outside of acceptable limits and assume
that the population behaviour is the same as the sample behaviour. Hence,
if 98% of the resistors lie between 2000 ± 0.1% we may be quite happy.
A quicker way of doing this is to use a statistical model. That is, we can
guess what the histogram would look like based on our past experience.
To use such a model we probably only need to know the population mean,
µ, and the population standard deviation, σ.
In the rest of this chapter, we will look at four possible ways of
modelling data, the normal distribution, the exponential distribution,
both continuous models, and the binomial distribution and the Poisson
distribution which are discrete models.
TLFeBOOK

Probability and statistics

21.10 The
normal
distribution
The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean. It is bell-shaped
and the fatness of the bell depends on its standard deviation. Examples
are given in Figure 21.20 and 21.21.
The normal distribution is very important because of the following
points:
1.
Many practical distributions approximate to the normal distribution.
Look at the histograms of lifetimes given in Figure 21.3 and of resis-
tances given in Figure 21.4 and you will see that they resemble the
normal distribution. Another common example is the distribution
of errors. If you were to get a large group of students to measure
the diameter of a washer to the nearest 0.1 mm, then a histogram of
the results would give an approximately normal distribution. This is
because the errors in the measurement are normally distributed.
2.
The central limit theorem. If we take a large number of samples from
a population and calculate the sample means then the distribution of
the sample means will behave like the normal distribution for all pop-
ulations (even those populations which are not distributed normally).
This is as a result of what is called the central limit theorem. There
is a project exploring the behaviour of sample means given in the
Projects and Investigations available on the companion website for
this book.
3.
Many other common distributions become like the normal distribu-
tion in special cases. For instance, the binomial distribution, which
we shall look at in Section 21.12, can be approximated by the normal
when the number of trials is very large.
Finding probabilities from
a continuous graph
Before we look at the normal distribution in more detail we need to ﬁnd
out how to relate the graph of a continuous function to our previous idea
of probability. In Section 21.3, we identiﬁed the probability of a class
with its relative frequency in a frequency distribution. That was all right
when we had already divided the various sample values into classes.
The problem with the normal distribution is that is has no such divisions
along the x-axis and no individual class heights, just a nice smooth curve.

distribution with µ = 0 and

The value of
the cumulative distribution
F(a) marked as an area on
the graph of the probability
density function, f(x), of a
continuous distribution.
To overcome this problem we deﬁne the probability of the outcome lying
in some interval of values, as the area under the graph of the probability
function between those two values as shown in Figure 21.22.
As we found in Chapter 7, the area under a curve is given by the integral;
therefore, for a continuous probability distribution, f (x), we deﬁne
p(x lies between a and b) =
 b
a
f (x) dx.
The cumulative distribution function gives us the probability of this value
or any previous value (it is like the cumulative relative frequency). A
continuous distribution thus becomes the ‘the area so far’ function and
therefore becomes the integral from the lowest possible value that can
occur in the distribution up to the current value.
The cumulative distribution up to a value a is represented by
F(a) =
 a
−∞
f (x) dx
and it is the total area under to graph of the probability function up to a;
this is shown in Figure 21.23.
We can also use the cumulative distribution function to represent prob-
abilities of a certain interval. The area between two values can be found
by subtracting two values of the cumulative distribution function as in
Figure 21.24.
However, there is a problem with the normal distribution function in
that is not easy to integrate! The probability density function for x, where
x is N(µ, σ 2) is given by
f (x) =
1

2πσ

where f (z) is the probability distribution with 0 mean (µ = 0) and
standard deviation of 1 (σ = 1). This is shown in Figure 21.25 and
tabulated in Table 21.3. In order to use these values we need to use ideas
of transformation of graphs from Chapter 2 to transform any normal
distribution into its standardized form.
The standardized normal curve
The standardized normal curve is obtained from the normal curve by the
substitution z = (x −µ)/σ and it converts the original distribution into
one with zero mean and standard deviation 1. This is useful because we
can use a table of values for z given in Table 21.3 to perform calculations.
Finding the probability that x lies
between a given range of values
Supposing we have decided that a sample of resistors have a mean of
10.02 and a standard deviation of 0.06, then what percentage lie inside
an acceptable tolerance of 10 ± 0.1?
We want to ﬁnd the area under the normal curve N(10.02, 0.062)
between x = 9.9 and x = 10.1, that is, the shaded area in Figure 21.26.
First, convert the x values to z values, by using z = (x −µ)/σ:
x = 9.9 ⇒z = 9.9 −10.02
0.06
= −2
x = 10.1 ⇒z = 10.1 −10.02
0.06
= 1.3333
So we now want to ﬁnd the shaded area for z values (which will be the
same area as above), shown in Figure 23.27.

shown in Figure 21.26.
Figure 21.28
The area outside
of the tolerance limits as given in
Figure 21.27.
In order to use Table 21.3, we need to express the problem in terms of
the proportion that lies outside of the tolerance limits, as in Figure 21.28.
We use the table of the standardized normal distribution to ﬁnd the
proportion less than z = −2. As the curve is symmetric this will be the
same as the proportion greater than z = 2. From the table this gives
0.02275.
The proportion greater than z = 1.33 from the table is 0.09176. Hence,
the proportion that lies outside of our limits is
0.02275 + 0.09176 = 0.11451.
As the total area is 1, the proportion within the limits is 1 −0.11451 =
0.88549.
21.11 The
exponential
distribution
The exponential distribution is also named as the failure rate function, as
it can be used to model the rate of failure of components.
Consider a set of 1000 light bulbs, a similar make to those tested in
Section 21.1. However, now consider a batch of bulbs at random that
have already been in use for some, unknown time. They are, therefore,
of mixed ages. On measuring the time of failure we get Table 21.4.
These data are represented in a histogram given in Figure 21.29, giving
the frequencies and relative frequencies, and Figure 21.30, giving the
cumulative frequencies and relative cumulative frequencies.
Notice that Figure 21.29 looks like a dying exponential. This is not
unreasonable as we might expect failure rates to be something like the
problem of radioactive decay of Chapter 8, that is, a dying exponential.
We could think of it in a similar way to a population problem. The pro-
portion that have failed after time t is given by the cumulative distribution
function F. The proportion that are still functioning is therefore 1 −F.
The increase in the total proportion of failures is given by the failure rate
multiplied by the number still functioning, if λ is the failure rate this gives
dF
dt = λ(1 −F).
This differential equation can be solved to give:
F = 1 −A e−λt.
Using the fact that at time 0 there are no failures then we ﬁnd A = 1.
This gives the cumulative distribution of the exponential distribution as
F = 1 −e−λt

where λ is the failure rate, that is, the proportion that will fail in unit time.
The probability distribution can be found from the cumulative distribution
by differentiating, giving
f = dF
dt = λ e−λt
Mean and standard deviation of
a continuous distribution
We can ﬁnd the mean and standard deviation of a continuous distribution
by using integration to replace the summation over all values. The mean
is given by
µ =

xf (x) dx
where the integration is over all values in the sample space for x. For the
exponential distribution this gives
µ =

xλ e−λx dx.
which can be found by using integration by parts (Chapter 7) to be 1/λ.
The standard deviation is given by
σ =

(x −µ)2f (x) dx
where the integration is over all values of x. For the exponential
distribution this gives
σ =
 ∞
0
(x −1/λ)2 λ e−λx dx.
Again using integration by parts, we obtain σ = 1/λ.
So we see that the mean is 1/λ, as is the standard deviation for the
exponential distribution.
Comparison of the data with the model
We can now compare a statistical model with the data given in Table 21.4.
To do this we calculate the cumulative frequencies for the maximum
value in each of the class intervals. The mean of the sample is 638.3.
We calculated that the mean of the exponential distribution is given by
1/λ the inverse of the failure rate.
638.3 = 1
λ
⇒λ = 1.567 × 10−3.
Using F(t) = 1 −e−λt
F(200) = 1 −e−1.567×10−3×200 ≈0.269
P(0 < x < 200) = F(200) −F(0) = 0.269
F(400) = 1 −e−1.567×10−3×400 ≈0.466
P(200 < x < 400) = F(400) −F(200) = 0.197
and so on, giving the values as in Table 21.5. The model’s predictions
agree quite well with the data. To ﬁnd the model predicted frequencies
and cumulative frequencies we multiply by the number in the sample,
1000.

21.12 The
binomial
distribution
Consider a random system with a sequence of trials, the trials being
such that:
1.
Each trial has two possible outcomes (e.g. non-defective, defective),
which we assign the outcomes of 1 (success) and 0 (failure). This
type of trial is called a Bernoulli trial.
2.
On each trial p(1) = θ and p(0) = 1 −θ and θ is the same on all
trials.
3.
The outcome of the n trails are mutually independent.
pn(r) is the outcome of r successes in n trials and
pn(r) =
n
r

θr(1 −θ)n−r
where
n
r

= nCr =
n!
(n −r)!r! = n(n −1) . . . (n −r + 1)
r!
.
Setting α = 1 −θ, the probability of r successes in n trials is given by
the rth term in the binomial expansion:
(θ + α)n = αn + nθαn−1 + n(n −1).
2!
θ2αn−2
+ n(n −1) . . . (n −r + 1)
r!
θrαn−r . . . + θn.
Hence, the term binomial distribution.
Example 21.14
In ﬁve tosses of a coin ﬁnd the probability of obtaining
three heads.

Mean and variance of a single trial
The mean of a discrete distribution can be found by using µ =  xp(x)
and the variance is
σ 2 =

(x −µ)2p(x)
where the summation is over the sample space.
We can use these to ﬁnd the mean and variance of a single trial with only
two outcomes, success or failure. The outcome of success has the value 1
and occurs with probability θ and the outcome of failure has the value 0
with probability 1−θ. Then, the mean is given by 1×θ +(1−θ)×0 = θ.
The variance of a single trial is given by
(1 −θ)2θ + (0 −θ)2(1 −θ) = θ −2θ2 + θ3 + θ2 −θ3 = θ(1 −θ).

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:

The mean and standard deviation of
the binomial distribution
The expressions involving a summation over the entire sample space
can be used to ﬁnd the mean and standard deviation of the binomial
distribution but they take a bit of manipulation to ﬁnd. Instead, we can
take a short cut and use the fact that each trial is independent. The mean
of the union of n trials is given by the sum of the means of the n trials.
Similarly (for independent trials only), the variance of the union of the n
trials is given by the sum of the variances.
Therefore, the mean of the binomial distribution for n trials is given
by the number of trials × mean for a single trial = nθ. The variance is
given by nθ(1 −θ) and therefore the standard deviation is
σ =

nθ(1 −θ).
Example 21.15
A ﬁle of data is stored on a magnetic tape with a parity
bit stored with each byte (8 bits) making 9 bits in all. The parity bit is set
so that the 9 bits add up to an even number. The parity bit allows errors
to be detected, but not corrected. However, if there are two errors in the
9 bits then the errors will go undetected, three errors will be detected,
four errors undetected, etc. A very poor magnetic tape was tested for the
reproduction of 1024 bits and 16 errors were found. If on one record on
the tape there are 4000 groups of 9 bits, estimate how many bytes will
have undetected errors.

Probability and statistics
Solution
Call 1 the outcome of a bit being in error and 0 that it is correct.
We are given that in 1024 (n) trials there were 16 errors. Taking 16 as the
mean over 1024 trials and using
1024θ = 16
θ =
16
1024 = 1
64.
Errors go undetected if there are 2, 4, 6, etc. The probability of two errors
in 9 bits is given by
P9(2) =

θ2(1 −θ)7 = 9!
7!2!
 1
64
2 63

7
= 0.0078717.
Multiplying by the number of data bytes of 4000 gives approximately 31
undetected errors.
The probability of four errors will obviously be much less.
P9(4) =

θ4(1 −θ)5 = 9!
4!5!
 1
64
4 63
64
5
= 0.0000008.
This probability is too small to show up only 4000 bytes. As the prob-
ability of six or eight errors is even smaller then they can safely be
ignored.
The probable number of undetected errors is 31.
21.13 The
Poisson
distribution
The Poisson distribution is used to model processes where the distribution
of the number of incidents occurring in any interval depends only on the
length of that interval. Examples of such systems are:
1.
incoming telephone calls to an exchange during a busy period;
2.
customers arriving at a checkout counter in a supermarket from 4 to
6 p.m.;
3.
accidents on a busy stretch of the M1;
4.
number of misprints in a book.
When modelling situations in a Poisson process we use four assump-
tions:
1.
If A is the event of n incidents in an interval and B the event of
m incidents in another non-overlapping interval then A and B are
independent, that is, p(A ∩B) = p(A)p(B).
2.
If A is the event of n incidents in an interval then P(A) depends only
on the length of the interval – not on the starting point of the interval.
3.
The probability of exactly one incident in a small interval is approx-
imately proportional to the length of that interval, that is, P1(t) ≈λt
for small t.
4.
The probability of more than one incident in a small interval is
negligible. Thus, for small t, P2(t) ≈0 and we can also say that
lim
t→0
Pn(t)
t
= 0
for n > 1.
It follows that P0(t) + P1(t) ≈1 and as by assumption (3), P1(t) ≈λt,
we get P0(t) ≈1 −λt. We now think about the number of incidents in
an interval of time of any given length, (0, t), where t is no longer small.
We can divide the interval into pieces of length h, where h is small, and
use the assumptions above. We can see that in each small interval of
TLFeBOOK

Probability and statistics
527
length h there is either no event or a single event. Therefore, each small
interval is approximately behaving like a Bernoulli trial. This means that
we can approximate the events in the interval (0, t) by using the Binomial
distribution for the number of successes r in n trials. The probability of
r incidents in n intervals, where the probability of an incident in any one
interval is λh, is given by
Pr(t) = lim
h→0
n

(λh)r(1 −λh)n−r.
Substituting h = t/n gives
Pr(t) = lim
n→∞
n!
(n −r)!r!

We can reorganize this expression, by taking out of the limit terms not
involving n

Now we notice that the ﬁrst term inside the limit is made up of the product
of r fractional expressions, which each have a term in n on the top and
bottom lines. These will all tend to 1 as n tends to ∞. The last term is
similar to the limit that we saw in Chapter 7 when calculating the value
of e. There, we showed that
lim


1 + 1
n
n

and by a similar argument we could show that

It, therefore follows that
lim
n→∞

1 −λt
n
n
= e−λt.
The last expression involves a negative power of (1 −λt/n), which will
tend to 1 as n tends to ∞.
This gives the Poisson distribution as
Pr(t) = (λt)r
r! e−λt.
This is an expression in both r and t where r is the number of events and
t is the length of the time interval being considered. We usually consider
the probability of r events in an interval of unit time, which gives the
Poisson distribution as
Pr = λr
r! e−λ
where λ is the expected number of incidents in unit time.

Probability and statistics
The mean and variance of
the Poisson distribution
The Poisson distribution was introduced by considering the probability
of a single event in a small interval of length h as (λh). We then used
the binomial distribution, with θ = λh and h = t/n and n tending to
∞, to derive the expression for the Poisson distribution. As the mean of
the binomial distribution is nθ, it would make sense that the mean of the
Poisson distribution is nλh. Using n = t/h we get the mean as λt over
an interval of length t and therefore the mean is λ over an interval of unit
length.
By a similar argument we know that the variance of the Binomial
distribution is nθ(1 −θ). Substituting θ = λh we get the variance as
nλh(1 −λh). As n tends to inﬁnity and h to 0 we get the limit λt.
Therefore, the variance in unit time is λ.
Example 21.16
The average number of ‘page not found’ errors on a
web server is 36 in a 24-h period. Find the probability in a 60-min period
that:
(a)
there are no errors;
(b)
there is exactly one error;
(c)
There are at most two errors;
(d)
there are more than three errors.
Solution
Assuming that the above process is a Poisson process, then
we have that the average number of errors in 24 h is 36 and therefore the
average is 1.5 in 1 h. As the mean is λ, we can now assume that the number
of errors in 1 h follows a Poisson distribution with λ = 1.5, giving
Pr = (1.5)r
r!
e−1.5.
(a)
We want to ﬁnd P(no errors) = P0 = ((1.5)0/0!)e−1.5 = e−1.5 ≈
0.2231.
(b)
We want to ﬁnd P(exactly one error) = P1 = (1.5)1/1! e−1.5 =
1.5e−1.5 ≈0.3347.
(c)
P(at most two errors) = P0 + P1 + P2 = 0.2231 + 0.3347 +
(1.5)2/2! e−1.5 = 0.8088.
(d)
P(more than three errors) = 1 −P (at most three errors) =
1 −(P0 + P1 + P2 + P3).
Using the result from Part (c) we get
P(more than three errors) = 1 −0.8808 −(1.5)3/3! e−1.5
≈1 −0.8808 −0.1255 = 0.0657.

The square of the standard deviation is called the variance.
3.
The cumulative frequency is found by summing the values of the
current class and all previous classes. It is the ‘number so far’.
4.
The relative frequency of a class is found by dividing the frequency
bythe numberofvaluesinthedatasample–thisgivestheproportion

by dividing the relative frequency by the number in the sample.
5.
In probability theory the set of all possible outcomes of a random
experiment is called the sample space. The probability distribution
function, for a discrete sample space, is a function of the outcomes
that obeys the conditions:
0 ⩽p(xi) ⩽1
where xi is any outcome in the sample space and

i
p(xi) = 1
where the summation is over all outcomes in the sample space.
6.
An event is a subset of the sample space. The probability of an event
(if all outcomes are equally likely) is
p(E) =
The number of outcomes in the event
The number of outcomes in the sample space.
7.
The addition law of probability is given by P(A ∪B) = P(A) +
P(B) −(A ∩B) for non-disjoint events.
If A∩B = ∅this becomes P(A∪B) = P(A)+P(B) for disjoint
events.
8.
Multiplication law of probabilities: p(A ∩B) = p(A)p(B|A) if
events A and B are not independent.

The deﬁnition of independence is that B is independent of A if
the probability of B does not depend on A: p(B|A) = p(B) if B

is independent of A. In this case the multiplication law becomes
p(A ∩B) = p(A)p(B), where A and B independent events.

11.
The normal, or Gaussian, distribution is a bell-shaped distribu-
tion. Many things, particularly involving error distributions, have a
probability distribution that is approximately normal.
12.
To calculate probabilities using a normal distribution we use areas
of the standard normal distribution in table form, so the variable
must be standardized by using the transformation
z = x −µ
σ
where µ is the mean and σ the standard deviation of the distribution.
13.
The exponential distribution is used to model times to failure.
14.
The probability density function of the exponential distribution is
f (t) = λ e−λt and the cumulative density function is given by
F = 1 −e−λt.
15.
The mean and standard deviation of a continuous distribution can
be found by
µ =

xf (x) dx
and
σ =

(x −µ)2f (x) dx
where the integration is over the sample space. For the exponential
distribution these give µ = 1/λ, that is, the mean time to failure is
the reciprocal of the failure rate. Also σ = 1/λ.
16.
The binomial distribution is a discrete distribution that models
repeated trials where the outcome of each trial is either success
or failure and each trial is independent of the others. Its probability
function is

The mean of a discrete distribution is given by µ =  xp(x) and
the variance is σ 2 =  (x −µ)2p(x). The mean of the binomial
distribution, for n trials, is nθ, the variance is nθ(1 −θ), and the
