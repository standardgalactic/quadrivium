Now set up a proportion to determine how long it takes this signal to travel

Therefore,

To solve this problem we use a product of ratios to change units from
dollars/year to dollars/millisecond. We begin by expressing $10 billion in
scientiﬁc notation:
$100 billion = $100 ⇥109.
Now we determine the number of milliseconds in one year, again using a
product of ratios:

Remember from Eq. 1.2, current is the time rate of change of charge, or i = dq
dt
In this problem, we are given the current and asked to ﬁnd the total charge.
To do this, we must integrate Eq. 1.2 to ﬁnd an expression for charge in terms
of current:
q(t) =
Z t
0 i(x) dx.
We are given the expression for current, i, which can be substituted into the
above expression. To ﬁnd the total charge, we let t ! 1 in the integral. Thus
we have
qtotal =

Recall from Eq. 1.2 that current is the time rate of change of charge, or
i = dq

ﬁnd the maximum current. First we will ﬁnd an expression for the current
using Eq. 1.2:

Now that we have an expression for the current, we can ﬁnd the maximum
value of the current by setting the ﬁrst derivative of the current to zero and
solving for t:
di
dt = d
dt(te−↵t) = e−↵t + t(−↵)e↵t = (1 −↵t)e−↵t = 0.
Since e−↵t never equals 0 for a ﬁnite value of t, the expression equals 0 only
when (1 −↵t) = 0. Thus, t = 1/↵will cause the current to be maximum. For
this value of t, the current is
i = 1
↵e−↵/↵= 1
↵e−1.

0.03679e−1 ⇠= 10 A.
AP 1.5
Start by drawing a picture of the circuit described in the problem statement:
Also sketch the four ﬁgures from Fig. 1.6:
[a] Now we have to match the voltage and current shown in the ﬁrst ﬁgure
with the polarities shown in Fig. 1.6. Remember that 4A of current
entering Terminal 2 is the same as 4A of current leaving Terminal 1. We
get
(a) v = −20 V,
i = −4 A;
(b) v = −20 V,
i = 4 A;
(c) v = 20 V,
i = −4 A;
(d) v = 20 V,
i = 4 A.
[b] Using the reference system in Fig. 1.6(a) and the passive sign convention,
p = vi = (−20)(−4) = 80 W.
[c] Since the power is greater than 0, the box is absorbing power.
AP 1.6
[a] Applying the passive sign convention to the power equation using the
voltage and current polarities shown in Fig. 1.5, p = vi. To ﬁnd the time
at which the power is maximum, ﬁnd the ﬁrst derivative of the power
with respect to time, set the resulting expression equal to zero, and solve
for time:
p = (80,000te−500t)(15te−500t) = 120 ⇥104t2e−1000t;
dp
dt = 240 ⇥104te−1000t −120 ⇥107t2e−1000t = 0.
Therefore,
240 ⇥104 −120 ⇥107t = 0.

Solving,
t = 240 ⇥104
120 ⇥107 = 2 ⇥10−3 = 2 ms.
[b] The maximum power occurs at 2 ms, so ﬁnd the value of the power at 2
ms:
p(0.002) = 120 ⇥104(0.002)2e−2 = 649.6 mW.
[c] From Eq. 1.3, we know that power is the time rate of change of energy, or
p = dw/dt. If we know the power, we can ﬁnd the energy by integrating
Eq. 1.3. To ﬁnd the total energy, the upper limit of the integral is
inﬁnity:
wtotal =

AP 1.7
At the Oregon end of the line the current is leaving the upper terminal, and
thus entering the lower terminal where the polarity marking of the voltage is
negative. Thus, using the passive sign convention, p = −vi. Substituting the
values of voltage and current given in the ﬁgure,
p = −(800 ⇥103)(1.8 ⇥103) = −1440 ⇥106 = −1440 MW.
Thus, because the power associated with the Oregon end of the line is
negative, power is being generated at the Oregon end of the line and
transmitted by the line to be delivered to the California end of the line.

First we use Eq. 1.2 to relate current and charge:

Therefore, dq = 24 cos 4000t dt.

we substitute x for q on the left side of the integral, and y for t on the right

12 V battery(the current i ﬂows into the + terminal of the battery of
Car B). Therefore using the passive sign convention,

convention to get p = vi, since the current i is ﬂowing into the + terminal of
the voltage v. Now we just substitute the values for v and i into the equation
for power. Remember that if the power is positive, B is absorbing power, so
the power must be ﬂowing from A to B. If the power is negative, B is

[a] We can ﬁnd the time at which the power is a maximum by writing an
expression for p(t) = v(t)i(t), taking the ﬁrst derivative of p(t)
and setting it to zero, then solving for t. The calculations are shown below:

p = 0

when t2 −40t + 266.67 = 0;
t1

t2 = 31.547 s;
(using the polynomial solver on your calculator)
p(t1)
=
4(8.453) −0.3(8.453)2 + 0.005(8.453)3 = 15.396 W;
p(t2)
=
4(31.547) −0.3(31.547)2 + 0.005(31.547)3 = −15.396 W.
Therefore, maximum power is being delivered at t = 8.453 s.
[b] The maximum power was calculated in part (a) to determine the time at
which the power is maximum: pmax = 15.396 W (delivered).
[c] As we saw in part (a), the other “maximum” power is actually a
minimum, or the maximum negative power. As we calculated in part (a),
maximum power is being extracted at t = 31.547 s.
[d] This maximum extracted power was calculated in part (a) to determine
the time at which power is maximum: pmax = 15.396 W (extracted).

power, whereas is the power is negative, the circuit element is developing

together — if the power balances, these power sums should be equal:
X
Pdev = 918 + 810 + 12 = 1740 mW;
X
Pabs = 400 + 224 + 1116 = 1740 mW.
Thus, the power balances and the total power developed in the circuit is 1740

ptotal = 0.175 + 0.375 + 0.150 −0.320 + 0.160 + 0.120 −0.660 = 0.
Thus, the power balances.

elements a, b, c, e, and f have positive power, these elements are
absorbing power.

Pabs and the subordinate engineer is correct.
[b] The di↵erence between the power delivered to the circuit and the power
absorbed by the circuit is
96,975 −60,975 = 36,000.
One-half of this di↵erence is 18,000 W, so it is likely that pc or pf is in
error. Either the voltage or the current probably has the wrong sign. (In
Chapter 2, we will discover that using KCL at the top node, the current
ic should be 30 A, not −30 A!) If the sign of pc is changed from negative
to positive, we can recalculate the power delivered and the power
absorbed as follows:

Pdel

Now the power delivered equals the power absorbed and the power
balances for the circuit.

vaia −vbib −vfif + vgig + vhih
= (120)(−10) −(120)(10) −(−120)(3) + 120ig + (−240)(−7) = 0.

so
ig = 360
120 = 3 A.
Thus, if the power in the modiﬁed circuit is balanced the current in
component g is 3 A.

[a] Note that the current ib is in the same circuit branch as the 8 A current
source; however, ib is deﬁned in the opposite direction of the current
source. Therefore,
ib = −8 A.
Next, note that the dependent voltage source and the independent
voltage source are in parallel with the same polarity. Therefore, their
voltages are equal, and
vg = ib
4 = −8
4 = −2 V.
[b] To ﬁnd the power associated with the 8 A source, we need to ﬁnd the
voltage drop across the source, vi. Note that the two independent sources
are in parallel, and that the voltages vg and v1 have the same polarities,
so these voltages are equal:
vi = vg = −2 V.
Using the passive sign convention,
ps = (8 A)(vi) = (8 A)(−2 V) = −16 W.
Thus the current source generated 16 W of power.

ﬂow in opposite directions. Therefore
↵vx = −15 A.
Solve the above equation for ↵and substitute for vx,
↵= −15 A
vx

−25 V = 0.6 A/V.
[b] To ﬁnd the power associated with the voltage source we need to know the
current, iv. Note that this current is in the same branch of the circuit as
the dependent current source and these two currents ﬂow in the same
direction. Therefore, the current iv is the same as the current of the
dependent source:
iv = ↵vx = (0.6)(−25) = −15 A.
Using the passive sign convention,
ps = −(iv)(25 V) = −(−15 A)(25 V) = 375 W.
Thus the voltage source dissipates 375 W.

[a] The resistor and the voltage source are in parallel and the resistor voltage

Note from the circuit that the current through the resistor is ig = 5 mA.
Use Ohm’s law to calculate the value of the resistor:
R = vR
ig
= 1 kV
5 mA = 200 k⌦.
Using the passive sign convention to calculate the power in the resistor,
pR = (vR)(ig) = (1 kV)(5 mA) = 5 W.
The resistor is dissipating 5 W of power.
[b] Note from part (a) the vR = vg and iR = ig. The power delivered by the
source is thus
psource = −vgig
so
vg = −psource
ig

75 mA = 40 V.
Since we now have the value of both the voltage and the current for the
resistor, we can use Ohm’s law to calculate the resistor value:
R = vg
ig

75 mA = 533.33 ⌦.
The power absorbed by the resistor must equal the power generated by
the source. Thus,
pR = −psource = −(−3 W) = 3 W.
[c] Again, note the iR = ig. The power dissipated by the resistor can be
determined from the resistor’s current:
pR = R(iR)2 = R(ig)2.
Solving for ig,

R = 480 mW

top, because the current source and the conductance are also in parallel

Now that we know the voltage drop across the current source, we can

A KCL equation at the upper right node gives i2 = i5; a KCL equation at
the bottom right node gives i5 = −i1; a KCL equation at the upper left
node gives is = −i2. Now replace the currents i1 and i2 in the Ohm’s law
equations with i5:
v2 = 3i2 = 3i5;
v5 = 7i5;
v1 = 2i1 = −2i5.
Now substitute these expressions for the three voltages into the ﬁrst
equation:
24 = v2 + v5 −v1 = 3i5 + 7i5 −(−2i5) = 12i5.
Therefore i5 = 24/12 = 2 A.
[b] v1 = −2i5 = −2(2) = −4 V.
[c] v2 = 3i5 = 3(2) = 6 V.
[d] v5 = 7i5 = 7(2) = 14 V.
[e] A KCL equation at the lower left node gives is = i1. Since i1 = −i5,
is = −2 A. We can now compute the power associated with the voltage
source:
p24 = (24)is = (24)(−2) = −48 W.
Therefore 24 V source is delivering 48 W.
AP 2.6
Redraw the circuit labeling all voltages and currents:
We can ﬁnd the value of the unknown resistor if we can ﬁnd the value of its
voltage and its current. To start, write a KVL equation clockwise around the
right loop, starting below the 24 ⌦resistor:
−120 V + v3 = 0.
Use Ohm’s law to calculate the voltage across the 8 ⌦resistor in terms of its
current:
v3 = 8i3.
Substitute the expression for v3 into the ﬁrst equation:
−120 V + 8i3 = 0
so
i3 = 120

Also use Ohm’s law to calculate the value of the current through the 24 ⌦
resistor:
i2 = 120 V
24 ⌦= 5 A.
Now write a KCL equation at the top middle node, summing the currents
leaving:
−i1 + i2 + i3 = 0
so
i1 = i2 + i3 = 5 + 15 = 20 A.
Write a KVL equation clockwise around the left loop, starting below the
voltage source:
−200 V + v1 + 120 V = 0
so
v1 = 200 −120 = 80 V.
Now that we know the values of both the voltage and the current for the
unknown resistor, we can use Ohm’s law to calculate the resistance:
R = v1

[a] Plotting a graph of vt versus it gives
Note that when it = 0, vt = 25 V; therefore the voltage source must be

Problems

[b] Draw the circuit model from part (a) and attach a 25 ⌦resistor:
To ﬁnd the power delivered to the 25 ⌦resistor we must calculate the
current through the 25 ⌦resistor. Do this by ﬁrst using KCL to recognize
that the current in each of the components is it, ﬂowing in a clockwise
direction. Write a KVL equation in the clockwise direction, starting
below the voltage source, and using Ohm’s law to express the voltage
drop across the resistors in the direction of the current it ﬂowing through
the resistors:
−25 V + 100it + 25it = 0
so
125it = 25
so
it = 25
125 = 0.2 A.
Thus, the power delivered to the 25 ⌦resistor is
p25 = (25)i2
t = (25)(0.2)2 = 1 W.
AP 2.8
[a] From the graph in Assessment Problem 2.7(a), we see that when vt = 0,
it = 0.25 A. Therefore the current source must be 0.25 A. Since the plot
is a straight line, its slope can be used to calculate the value of resistance:
R = ∆v
∆i = 25 −0
0.25 −0 = 25
0.25 = 100 ⌦.

so
5vt = 25,

vt = 5 V;
p25 = v2

25 = 1 W.
AP 2.9
First note that we know the current through all elements in the circuit except
the 6 k⌦resistor (the current in the three elements to the left of the 6 k⌦
resistor is i1; the current in the three elements to the right of the 6 k⌦resistor
is 30i1). To ﬁnd the current in the 6 k⌦resistor, write a KCL equation at the
top node:
i1 + 30i1 = i6k = 31i1.
We can then use Ohm’s law to ﬁnd the voltages across each resistor in terms
of i1. The results are shown in the ﬁgure below:
[a] To ﬁnd i1, write a KVL equation around the left-hand loop, summing
voltages in a clockwise direction starting below the 5 V source:
−5 V + 54,000i1 −1 V + 186,000i1 = 0.
Solving for i1
54,000i1 + 186,000i1 = 6 V
so
240,000i1 = 6 V.
Thus,
i1 =
6
240,000 = 25 µA.
[b] Now that we have the value of i1, we can calculate the voltage for each
component except the dependent source. Then we can write a KVL
equation for the right-hand loop to ﬁnd the voltage v of the dependent
source. Sum the voltages in the clockwise direction, starting to the left of
the dependent source:
+v −54,000i1 + 8 V −186,000i1 = 0.

Thus,
v = 240,000i1 −8 V = 240,000(25 ⇥10−6) −8 V = 6 V −8 V = −2 V.

[c] The total power generated in the circuit is the sum of the negative power
values in the power table:
−125 µW + −25 µW + −6000 µW = −6150 µW.
Thus, the total power generated in the circuit is 6150 µW.
[d] The total power absorbed in the circuit is the sum of the positive power
values in the power table:
33.75 µW + 3603.75 µW + 1500 µW + 1012.5 µW = 6150 µW.
Thus, the total power absorbed in the circuit is 6150 µW.
AP 2.10 Given that iφ = 2 A, we know the current in the dependent source is
2iφ = 4 A. We can write a KCL equation at the left node to ﬁnd the current in
the 10 ⌦resistor. Summing the currents leaving the node,
−5 A + 2 A + 4 A + i10⌦= 0
so
i10⌦= 5 A −2 A −4 A = −1 A.
Thus, the current in the 10 ⌦resistor is 1 A, ﬂowing right to left, as seen in
the circuit below.

CHAPTER 2. Circuit Elements
[a] To ﬁnd vs, write a KVL equation, summing the voltages counter-clockwise
around the lower right loop. Start below the voltage source.
−vs + (1 A)(10 ⌦) + (2 A)(30 ⌦) = 0
so
vs = 10 V + 60 V = 70 V.
[b] The current in the voltage source can be found by writing a KCL equation
at the right-hand node. Sum the currents leaving the node
−4 A + 1 A + iv = 0
so
iv = 4 A −1 A = 3 A.
The current in the voltage source is 3 A, ﬂowing top to bottom. The
power associated with this source is
p = vi = (70 V)(3 A) = 210 W.
Thus, 210 W are absorbed by the voltage source.
[c] The voltage drop across the independent current source can be found by
writing a KVL equation around the left loop in a clockwise direction:
−v5A + (2 A)(30 ⌦) = 0
so
v5A = 60 V.
The power associated with this source is
p = −v5Ai = −(60 V)(5 A) = −300 W.
This source thus delivers 300 W of power to the circuit.
[d] The voltage across the controlled current source can be found by writing a
KVL equation around the upper right loop in a clockwise direction:
+v4A + (10 ⌦)(1 A) = 0
so
v4A = −10 V.
The power associated with this source is
p = v4Ai = (−10 V)(4 A) = −40 W.
This source thus delivers 40 W of power to the circuit.
[e] The total power dissipated by the resistors is given by
(i30⌦)2(30 ⌦) + (i10⌦)2(10 ⌦) = (2)2(30 ⌦) + (1)2(10 ⌦) = 120 + 10 = 130 W.

P 2.1
The interconnection is valid. The 10 A current source has a voltage drop of
100 V, positive at the top, because the 100 V source supplies its voltage drop
across a pair of terminals shared by the 10 A current source. The right hand
branch of the circuit must also have a voltage drop of 100 V from the left
terminal of the 40 V source to the bottom terminal of the 5 A current source,
because this branch shares the same terminals as the 100 V source. This
means that the voltage drop across the 5 A current source is 140 V, positive at
the top. Also, the two voltage sources can carry the current required of the
interconnection. This is summarized in the ﬁgure below:
From the values of voltage and current in the ﬁgure, the power supplied by the

The interconnection is not valid. Note that the 3 A and 4 A sources are both
connected in the same branch of the circuit. A valid interconnection would
require these two current sources to supply the same current in the same
direction, which they do not.
P 2.4
The interconnect is valid since the voltage sources can all carry 5 A of current
supplied by the current source, and the current source can carry the voltage
drop required by the interconnection. Note that the branch containing the 10
V, 40 V, and 5 A sources must have the same voltage drop as the branch
containing the 50 V source, so the 5 A current source must have a voltage
drop of 20 V, positive at the right. The voltages and currents are summarize

First there is no violation of Kirchho↵’s laws, hence the interconnection is

Kirchho↵’s voltage law requires

so
v1 −v2 = −40 V.
The conservation of energy law requires
−(5 ⇥10−3)v2 −(15 ⇥10−3)v2 −(20 ⇥10−3)(20) + (20 ⇥10−3)(60) + (20 ⇥10−3)v1 = 0

Hence any combination of v1 and v2 such that v1 −v2 = −40 V is a valid
solution.
P 2.6
[a] The voltage drop from the top node to the bottom node in this circuit
must be the same for every path from the top to the bottom. Therefore,
the voltages of the two voltage sources are equal:
−↵i∆= 6.
Also, the current i∆is in the same branch as the 15 mA current source,
but in the opposite direction, so
i∆= −0.015A.
Substituting,
−↵(−0.015) = 6
!
↵=
6
0.015 = 400.
The interconnection is valid if ↵= 400 V/A.
[b] The voltage across the current source must equal the voltage across the 6
V source, since both are connected between the top and bottom nodes.
Using the passive sign convention,
p = vi = (6)(0.015) = 0.09 = 90 mW.
[c] Since the power is positive, the current source is absorbing power.
P 2.7
[a] Because both current sources are in the same branch of the circuit, their
values must be the same. Therefore,
v1

v1 = 0.4(50) = 20 V.
[b] p = v1(0.4) = (20)(0.4) = 8 W (absorbed).
P 2.8
The interconnection is invalid. In the middle branch, the value of the current
ix must be 50 mA, since the 50 mA current source supplies current in this
branch in the same direction as the current ix. Therefore, the voltage supplied
by the dependent voltage source in the right hand branch is 1800(0.05) = 90
V. This gives a voltage drop from the top terminal to the bottom terminal in
the right hand branch of 90 + 60 = 150 V. But the voltage drop between these
same terminals in the left hand branch is 30 V, due to the voltage source in
that branch. Therefore, the interconnection is invalid.

CHAPTER 2. Circuit Elements
First, 10va = 5 V, so va = 0.5 V. Then recognize that each of the three
branches is connected between the same two nodes, so each of these branches
must have the same voltage drop. The voltage drop across the middle branch
is 5 V, and since va = 0.5 V, vg = 0.5 −5 = −4.5 V. Also, the voltage drop
across the left branch is 5 V, so 20 + v9A = 5 V, and v9A = −15 V, where v9A
is positive at the top. Note that the current through the 20 V source must be
9 A, ﬂowing from top to bottom, and the current through the vg is 6 A ﬂowing
from top to bottom. Let’s ﬁnd the power associated with the left and middle
branches:
p9A = (9)(−15) = −135 W;
p20V = (9)(20) = 180 W;
pvg = −(6)(−4.5) = 27 W;
p6A = (6)(0.5) = 3 W.
Since there is only one component left, we can ﬁnd the total power:
ptotal = −135 + 180 + 27 + 3 + pds = 75 + pds = 0
so pds must equal −75 W.
Therefore,

Pdev =

Pabs = 210 W.
P 2.10
[a] Yes, Kirchho↵’s laws are not violated. (Note that i∆= −8 A.)
[b] No, because the voltages across the independent and dependent current
sources are indeterminate. For example, deﬁne v1, v2, and v3 as shown:
Kirchho↵’s voltage law requires
v1 + 20 = v3;
v2 + 100 = v3.
Conservation of energy requires
−8(20) −8v1 −16v2 −16(100) + 24v3 = 0
or
v1 + 2v2 −3v3 = −220.
Now arbitrarily select a value of v3 and show the conservation of energy

v2 = 150i2,
v3 = 250i2.
Substituting,
−100i1 + 150i2 + 250i2 = 0
so
−100i1 + 400i2 = 0.
Solving the two equations for i1 and i2 simultaneously,
i1 = 1.2 A

[a] Write a KVL equation clockwise aroud the right loop, starting below the
300 ⌦resistor:
−va + vb = −0
so
va = vb.
Using Ohm’s law,
va = 300ia
and
vb = 75ib.
Substituting,
300ia = 75ib
so
ib = 4ia.
Write a KCL equation at the top middle node, summing the currents
leaving:
−ig + ia + ib = 0
so
ig = ia + ib = ia + 4ia = 5ia.
Write a KVL equation clockwise around the left loop, starting below the
voltage source:
−200 V + v40 + va = 0.
From Ohm’s law,
v40 = 40ig
and
va = 300ia.
Substituting,
−200 V + 40ig + 300ia = 0
Substituting for ig:
−200 V + 40(5ia) + 300ia = −200 V + 200ia + 300ia = −200 V + 500ia = 0.
Thus,
500ia = 200 V
so
ia = 200 V
500
= 0.4 A.
[b] From part (a), ib = 4ia = 4(0.4 A) = 1.6 A.

Label the unknown resistor currents and voltages:
[a] KCL at the top node:

KVL around the right loop:
−vo + v2 −5 = 0.
Use Ohm’s law to write the resistor voltages in the previous equation in
terms of the resistor currents:
−5000i1 + 2000i2 −5 = 0
!
−5000i1 + 2000i2 = 5.
Multiply the KCL equation by −2000 and add it to the KVL equation to
eliminate i2:
−2000(i1 + i2) + (−5000i1 + 2000i2) = −2000(0.02) + 5
!
−7000i1 = −35.
Solving,
i1 =

−7000 = 0.005 = 5 mA.
Therefore,
vo = Ri1 = (5000)(0.005) = 25 V.

[a] Start with the 22.5 ⌦resistor. Since the voltage drop across this resistor is
90 V, we can use Ohm’s law to calculate the current:
i22.5 ⌦= 90 V
22.5 ⌦= 4 A.
Next we can calculate the voltage drop across the 15 ⌦resistor by writing
a KVL equation around the outer loop of the circuit:

so
v15 ⌦= 240 −90 = 150 V.
Now that we know the voltage drop across the 15 ⌦resistor, we can use
Ohm’s law to ﬁnd the current in this resistor:
i15 ⌦= 150 V
15 ⌦= 10 A.
Write a KCL equation at the middle right node to ﬁnd the current

[b] We can calculate the current in the voltage source, ig by writing a KCL

Now that we have both the voltage and the current for the source, we can

Start from the right hand side of the circuit and make series and parallel
combinations of the resistors until one equivalent resistor remains. Begin by
combining the 6 ⌦resistor and the 10 ⌦resistor in series:
6 ⌦+ 10 ⌦= 16 ⌦.
Now combine this 16 ⌦resistor in parallel with the 64 ⌦resistor:
16 ⌦k64 ⌦= (16)(64)
16 + 64 = 1024

This equivalent 12.8 ⌦resistor is in series with the 7.2 ⌦resistor:

Finally, this equivalent 20 ⌦resistor is in parallel with the 30 ⌦resistor:
20 ⌦k30 ⌦= (20)(30)
20 + 30 = 600
50 = 12 ⌦.
Thus, the simpliﬁed circuit is as shown:

CHAPTER 3. Simple Resistive Circuits
[a] With the simpliﬁed circuit we can use Ohm’s law to ﬁnd the voltage across
both the current source and the 12 ⌦equivalent resistor:
v = (12 ⌦)(5 A) = 60 V.
[b] Now that we know the value of the voltage drop across the current source,
we can use the formula p = −vi to ﬁnd the power associated with the
source:
p = −(60 V)(5 A) = −300 W.
Thus, the source delivers 300 W of power to the circuit.
[c] We now can return to the original circuit, shown in the ﬁrst ﬁgure. In this
circuit, v = 60 V, as calculated in part (a). This is also the voltage drop
across the 30 ⌦resistor, so we can use Ohm’s law to calculate the current
through this resistor:
iA = 60 V
30 ⌦= 2 A.
Now write a KCL equation at the upper left node to ﬁnd the current iB:
−5 A + iA + iB = 0
so
iB = 5 A −iA = 5 A −2 A = 3 A.
Next, write a KVL equation around the outer loop of the circuit, using
Ohm’s law to express the voltage drop across the resistors in terms of the
current through the resistors:
−v + 7.2iB + 6iC + 10iC = 0.
So
16iC = v −7.2iB = 60 V −(7.2)(3) = 38.4 V.
Thus
iC = 38.4
16 = 2.4 A.
Now that we have the current through the 10 ⌦resistor we can use the
formula p = Ri2 to ﬁnd the power:
p10 ⌦= (10)(2.4)2 = 57.6 W.

[a] We can use voltage division to calculate the voltage vo across the 75 k⌦
resistor:
vo(no load) =
75,000
75,000 + 25,000(200 V) = 150 V.
[b] When we have a load resistance of 150 k⌦then the voltage vo is across the
parallel combination of the 75 k⌦resistor and the 150 k⌦resistor. First,
calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination:
75 k⌦k150 k⌦= (75,000)(150,000)
75,000 + 150,000 = 50,000 ⌦= 50 k⌦.
Now use voltage division to ﬁnd vo across this equivalent resistance:
vo =
50,000
50,000 + 25,000(200 V) = 133.3 V.
[c] If the load terminals are short-circuited, the 75 k⌦resistor is e↵ectively
removed from the circuit, leaving only the voltage source and the 25 k⌦
resistor. We can calculate the current in the resistor using Ohm’s law:
i = 200 V
25 k⌦= 8 mA.
Now we can use the formula p = Ri2 to ﬁnd the power dissipated in the
25 k⌦resistor:
p25k = (25,000)(0.008)2 = 1.6 W.
[d] The power dissipated in the 75 k⌦resistor will be maximum at no load
since vo is maximum. In part (a) we determined that the no-load voltage
is 150 V, so be can use the formula p = v2/R to calculate the power:
p75k(max) = (150)2
75,000 = 0.3 W.

[a] We will write a current division equation for the current through the 80⌦
resistor and use this equation to solve for R:
i80⌦=
R
R + 40 ⌦+ 80 ⌦(20 A) = 4 A
so
20R = 4(R + 120).
Thus
16R = 480
and
R = 480
16 = 30 ⌦.
[b] With R = 30 ⌦we can calculate the current through R using current
division, and then use this current to ﬁnd the power dissipated by R,
using the formula p = Ri2:
iR =
40 + 80
40 + 80 + 30(20 A) = 16 A
so
pR = (30)(16)2 = 7680 W.
[c] Write a KVL equation around the outer loop to solve for the voltage v,
and then use the formula p = −vi to calculate the power delivered by the
current source:
−v + (60 ⌦)(20 A) + (30 ⌦)(16 A) = 0
so
v = 1200 + 480 = 1680 V.
Thus,
psource = −(1680 V)(20 A) = −33,600 W.
Thus, the current source generates 33,600 W of power.

Thus,
Req = 10 ⌦.
Now we can use voltage division to ﬁnd the voltage vo:
vo =

40 + 10 + 70(60 V) = 20 V.
[b] The current through the 40 ⌦resistor can be found using Ohm’s law:
i40⌦= vo
40 = 20 V
40 ⌦= 0.5 A.
This current ﬂows from left to right through the 40 ⌦resistor. To use
current division, we need to ﬁnd the equivalent resistance of the two
parallel branches containing the 20 ⌦resistor and the 50 ⌦and 10 ⌦
resistors:
20 ⌦k(50 ⌦+ 10 ⌦) = (20)(60)
20 + 60 = 15 ⌦.
Now we use current division to ﬁnd the current in the 30 ⌦branch:
i30⌦=
15
15 + 30(0.5 A) = 0.16667 A = 166.67 mA.
[c] We can ﬁnd the power dissipated by the 50 ⌦resistor if we can ﬁnd the
current in this resistor. We can use current division to ﬁnd this current
from the current in the 40 ⌦resistor, but ﬁrst we need to calculate the
equivalent resistance of the 20 ⌦branch and the 30 ⌦branch:
20 ⌦k30 ⌦= (20)(30)
20 + 30 = 12 ⌦.
Current division gives:
i50⌦=
12
12 + 50 + 10(0.5 A) = 0.08333 A.
Thus,
p50⌦= (50)(0.08333)2 = 0.34722 W = 347.22 mW.

the voltmeter:

[a] Using the condition for a balanced bridge, the products of the opposite
resistors must be equal. Therefore,
100Rx = (1000)(150)
so
Rx = (1000)(150)
100
= 1500 ⌦= 1.5 k⌦.
[b] When the bridge is balanced, there is no current ﬂowing through the
meter, so the meter acts like an open circuit. This places the following
branches in parallel: The branch with the voltage source, the branch with
the series combination R1 and R3 and the branch with the series
combination of R2 and Rx. We can ﬁnd the current in the latter two
branches using Ohm’s law:
iR1,R3 =
5 V
100 ⌦+ 150 ⌦= 20 mA;
iR2,Rx =
5 V
1000 + 1500 = 2 mA.
We can calculate the power dissipated by each resistor using the formula
p = Ri2:
p100⌦= (100 ⌦)(0.02 A)2 = 40 mW;
p150⌦= (150 ⌦)(0.02 A)2 = 60 mW;
p1000⌦= (1000 ⌦)(0.002 A)2 = 4 mW;
p1500⌦= (1500 ⌦)(0.002 A)2 = 6 mW.
Since none of the power dissipation values exceeds 250 mW, the bridge
can be left in the balanced state without exceeding the power-dissipating
capacity of the resistors.

CHAPTER 3. Simple Resistive Circuits
The circuit with these new ∆-connected resistors is shown below:
From this circuit we see that the 70 ⌦resistor is parallel to the 28 ⌦resistor:
70 ⌦k28 ⌦= (70)(28)
70 + 28 = 20 ⌦.
Also, the 17.5 ⌦resistor is parallel to the 105 ⌦resistor:
17.5 ⌦k105 ⌦= (17.5)(105)
17.5 + 105 = 15 ⌦.
Once the parallel combinations are made, we can see that the equivalent 20 ⌦
resistor is in series with the equivalent 15 ⌦resistor, giving an equivalent
resistance of 20 ⌦+ 15 ⌦= 35 ⌦. Finally, this equivalent 35 ⌦resistor is in
parallel with the other 35 ⌦resistor:
35 ⌦k35 ⌦= (35)(35)
35 + 35 = 17.5 ⌦.
Thus, the resistance seen by the 2 A source is 17.5 ⌦, and the voltage can be
calculated using Ohm’s law:
v = (17.5 ⌦)(2 A) = 35 V.

Let Re = R2kRL =

Thus, R2 = 300 ⌦
and
R1 = 4(300) = 1200 ⌦.
[b] The resistor that must dissipate the most power is R1, as it has the largest
resistance and carries the same current as the parallel combination of R2
and the load resistor. The power dissipated in R1 will be maximum when
the voltage across R1 is maximum. This will occur when the voltage
divider has a resistive load. Thus,
vR1 = 40 −7.5 = 32.5 V;
pR1 = 32.52
1200 = 880.2 m W.
Thus the minimum power rating for all resistors should be 1 W.
P 3.15
Refer to the solution to Problem 3.14. The voltage divider will reach the
maximum power it can safely dissipate when the power dissipated in R1 equals
1 W. Thus,
v2

so
vR1 = 34.64 V.

Thus, (300)RL

Begin by using KCL at the top node to relate the branch currents to the
current supplied by the source. Then use the relationships among the branch
currents to express every term in the KCL equation using just i2:
0.05 = i1 + i2 + i3 + i4 = 0.6i2 + i2 + 2i2 + 4i1 = 0.6i2 + i2 + 2i2 + 4(0.6i2) = 6i2.
Therefore,
i2 = 0.05/6 = 0.00833 = 8.33 mA.
Find the remaining currents using the value of i2:
i1 = 0.6i2 = 0.6(0.00833) = 0.005 = 5 mA;
i3 = 2i2 = 2(0.00833) = 0.01667 = 16.67 mA;
i4 = 4i1 = 4(0.005) = 0.02 = 20 mA.
Since the resistors are in parallel, the same voltage, 25 V, appears across each
of them. We know the current and the voltage for every resistor so we can use
Ohm’s law to calculate the values of the resistors:
R1 = 25/i1 = 25/0.005 = 5000 = 5 k⌦;
R2 = 25/i2 = 25/0.00833 = 3000 = 3 k⌦;

branch are in series and the voltage drop across each branch is 21 V:
is =
21 V
800 ⌦+ 600 ⌦+
21 V
1200 ⌦+ 900 ⌦= 25 mA.
[c] We can use Ohm’s law to ﬁnd the current in each branch:
ileft =
21
800 + 600 = 15 mA;
iright =
21
1200 + 900 = 10 mA.
Now we can use the formula p = Ri2 to ﬁnd the power dissipated by each
resistor:
p800 = (800)(0.015)2 = 180 mW
p600 = (600)(0.015)2 = 135 mW;
p1200 = (1200)(0.01)2 = 120 mW
p900 = (900)(0.01)2 = 90 mW.
Thus, the 800 ⌦resistor absorbs the most power; it absorbs 180 mW of
power.
[d] From the analysis in part (c), the 900 ⌦resistor absorbs the least power; it
absorbs 90 mW of power.

Begin by transforming the ∆-connected resistors (10 ⌦, 40 ⌦, 50 ⌦) to
Y-connected resistors. Both the Y-connected and ∆-connected resistors are
shown below to assist in using Eqs. 3.15 – 3.17:
Now use Eqs. 3.15 – 3.17 to calculate the values of the Y-connected resistors:
R1 =
(40)(10)
10 + 40 + 50 = 4 ⌦;
R2 =
(10)(50)
10 + 40 + 50 = 5 ⌦;
R3 =
(40)(50)
10 + 40 + 50 = 20 ⌦.
The transformed circuit is shown below:
The equivalent resistance seen by the 24 V source can be calculated by making
series and parallel combinations of the resistors to the right of the 24 V source:
Req = (15 + 5)k(1 + 4) + 20 = 20k5 + 20 = 4 + 20 = 24 ⌦.
Therefore, the current i in the 24 V source is given by
i = 24 V
24 ⌦= 1 A.
Use current division to calculate the currents i1 and i2. Note that the current
i1 ﬂows in the branch containing the 15 ⌦and 5 ⌦series connected resistors,
while the current i2 ﬂows in the parallel branch that contains the series
connection of the 1 ⌦and 4 ⌦resistors:
i1 =
4
15 + 5(i) = 4
20(1 A) = 0.2 A,
and
i2 = 1 A −0.2 A = 0.8 A.
Now use KVL and Ohm’s law to calculate v1. Note that v1 is the sum of the
voltage drop across the 4 ⌦resistor, 4i2, and the voltage drop across the 20 ⌦
resistor, 20i:
v1 = 4i2 + 20i = 4(0.8 A) + 20(1 A) = 3.2 + 20 = 23.2 V.

v2 = 5i1 + 20i = 5(0.2 A) + 20(1 A) = 1 + 20 = 21 V.

Use current division to calculate i1:
i1 =

22 + 18 + 4 + 6(5 A) = 40
50(5 A) = 4 A.
[b] Return to the original circuit and write a KVL equation around the upper
left loop:
(22 ⌦)i22⌦+ v −(4 ⌦)(i1) = 0;
so
v = (4 ⌦)(4 A) −(22 ⌦)(5 A −4 A) = −6 V.
[c] Write a KCL equation at the lower center node of the original circuit:
i2 = i1 + v
60 = 4 + −6
60 = 3.9 A.
[d] Write a KVL equation around the bottom loop of the original circuit:
−v5A + (4 ⌦)(4 A) + (10 ⌦)(3.9 A) + (1 ⌦)(5 A) = 0.
So,
v5A = (4)(4) + (10)(3.9) + (1)(5) = 60 V.

Adding this expression to Eq. 3.12 and solving for R1 gives
R1 = RcRb/(Ra + Rb + Rc).
To ﬁnd R2, subtract Eq. 3.14 from Eq. 3.12 and add this result to Eq. 3.13.
To ﬁnd R3, subtract Eq. 3.12 from Eq. 3.13 and add this result to Eq. 3.14.

Solving for Rb gives Rb = (R1R2 + R2R3 + R3R1)/R2. To ﬁnd Ra: First use
Eqs. 3.15–3.17 to obtain the ratios (R1/R3) = (Rc/Ra) or Rc = (R1/R3)Ra
and (R1/R2) = (Rb/Ra) or Rb = (R1/R2)Ra. Now use these relationships to
eliminate Rb and Rc from Eq. 3.13. To ﬁnd Rc, use Eqs. 3.15–3.17 to obtain
the ratios Rb = (R3/R2)Rc and Ra = (R3/R1)Rc. Now use the relationships to
eliminate Rb and Ra from Eq. 3.12.

y = (1 −β)py.
Remember that the value of y is capped at (py −1).

x = (1 −↵)px = (1 −0.2)(480) = 384;
y = (1 −β)py = (1 −0.75)(800) = 200.
Therefore, the touch occurred in the upper right corner of the screen.

P 3.75
From the results of Problem 3.74, the voltages corresponding to the touch
point (480, 192) are
Vx1 = 2 V;
Vy1 = 6.5 V.
Now calculate the voltages corresponding to the touch point (240, 384):
x = (1 −↵)px
so
↵= 1 −x
px
= 1 −240
640 = 0.625;
Vx2 = ↵VS = (0.625)(8) = 5 V;
y = (1 −β)py

β = 1 −y
py

1024 = 0.625;
Vy2 = βVS = (0.625)(8) = 5 V.

Problems

When the screen is touched at two points simultaneously, only the smaller of
the two voltages in the x direction is sensed. The same is true in the y
direction. Therefore, the voltages actually sensed are
Vx = 2 V;
Vy = 5 V.
These two voltages identify the touch point as (480, 384), which does not
correspond to either of the points actually touched! Therefore, the resistive
touch screen is appropriate only for single point touches.

Therefore the 80 V source is delivering 400 W to the circuit.

pds = −(−3vφ)i2 = 3(12)(−1) = −36 W.
Thus, the dependent source is delivering 36 W, or absorbing −36 W.

The mesh current equations are:

2ib + 8(ib −ic) + 6(ib −ia)
=
0;
5iφ + 8(ic −ia) + 8(ic −ib)

The dependent source constraint equation is iφ = ia. We can substitute this
simple expression for iφ into the third mesh equation and place the equations
in standard form:
14ia −6ib −8ic

−6ia + 16ib −8ic

Thus, vo = 8(ia −ic) = 8(4 −2) = 16 V.

p2 ⌦= (6)2(2) = 72 W.
Thus, the 2 ⌦resistors dissipates 72 W.
AP 4.11 Redraw the circuit and identify the mesh currents:
There are current sources on the perimeters of both the ib mesh and the ic

The remaining mesh current equation is
−75 + 2(ia + 10) + 5(ia −0.4vφ) = 0.
The dependent source requires the following constraint equation:

Place the mesh current equation and the dependent source equation is

The 2 A current source is shared by the meshes ia and ib. Thus we combine
these meshes to form a supermesh and write the following equation:

The other mesh current equation is
−6 + 1ic + 2(ic −ia) + 2(ic −ib) = 0.
The supermesh constraint equation is
ia −ib = 2.
Place these three equations in standard form:
2ia + 4ib −4ic

−2ia −2ib + 5ic

ia −ib + 0ic

30ix + 5i2 + 6(i2 −i1) + 3(i2 −4)

The constraint equation due to the dependent source is

Substitute the constraint equation into the second mesh equation and place
the resulting two mesh equations in standard form:

AP 4.17 We begin by performing a source transformation, turning the parallel
combination of the 15 A source and 8 ⌦resistor into a series combination of a
120 V source and an 8 ⌦resistor, as shown in the ﬁgure on the left. Next,
combine the 2 ⌦, 8 ⌦and 10 ⌦resistors in series to give an equivalent 20 ⌦
resistance. Then transform the series combination of the 120 V source and the
20 ⌦equivalent resistance into a parallel combination of a 6 A source and a
20 ⌦resistor, as shown in the ﬁgure on the right.
Finally, combine the 20 ⌦and 12 ⌦parallel resistors to give
RN = 20k12 = 7.5 ⌦. Thus, the Norton equivalent circuit is the parallel
combination of a 6 A source and a 7.5 ⌦resistor.
AP 4.18 Find the Th´evenin equivalent with respect to A, B using source
transformations. To begin, convert the series combination of the −36 V source
and 12 k⌦resistor into a parallel combination of a −3 mA source and 12 k⌦
resistor. The resulting circuit is shown below:
Now combine the two parallel current sources and the two parallel resistors to
give a −3 + 18 = 15 mA source in parallel with a 12 kk60 k= 10 k⌦resistor.
Then transform the 15 mA source in parallel with the 10 k⌦resistor into a
150 V source in series with a 10 k⌦resistor, and combine this 10 k⌦resistor
in series with the 15 k⌦resistor. The Th´evenin equivalent is thus a 150 V
source in series with a 25 k⌦resistor, as seen to the left of the terminals A,B
in the circuit below.

Also, using Ohm’s law for the 8 ⌦resistor,
ix = vTh

Substituting the second equation into the ﬁrst and solving for vTh yields
vTh = 8 V.
Now calculate RTh. To do this, we use the test source method. Replace the
voltage source with a short circuit, the current source with an open circuit,
and apply the test voltage vT, as shown in the circuit below:
Write a KCL equation at the middle node:
iT = ix + 3ix + vT/2 = 4ix + vT/2.
Use Ohm’s law to determine ix as a function of vT:

Thus, the Th´evenin equivalent is a 30 V source in series with a 10 ⌦resistor.
AP 4.21 First ﬁnd the Th´evenin equivalent circuit. To ﬁnd vTh, create an open circuit

Solving, vTh = 120 V, v1 = 80 V, and vφ = 60 V.
Now create a short circuit between nodes a and b and use the mesh current
method with the circuit below:
The mesh current equations are

−vφ + 4i2 + 4(i2 −isc) + 4(i2 −i1)

AP 4.22 Sustituting the value R = 3 ⌦into the circuit and identifying three mesh

Solving, i1 = 30 A, i2 = 20 A, i3 = 20 A, and vφ = 40 V.
[a] p100V = −(100)i1 = −(100)(30) = −3000 W. Thus, the 100 V source is
delivering 3000 W.
[b] pdepsource = −vφi2 = −(40)(20) = −800 W. Thus, the dependent source is
delivering 800 W.
[c] From Assessment Problem 4.21(b), the power delivered to the load resistor
is 1200 W, so the load power is (1200/3800)100 = 31.58% of the
combined power generated by the 100 V source and the dependent source.

[a] 11 branches, 8 branches with resistors, 2 branches with independent
sources, 1 branch with a dependent source.
[b] The current is unknown in every branch except the one containing the 8 A

[c] 9 essential branches: R4 −R5 forms an essential branch as does R8 −10 V.
The remaining seven branches are essential branches that contain a single

6 window panes or meshes.
P 4.2 [a] From Problem 4.1(d) there are 8 essential branches where the current is
unknown, so we need 8 simultaneous equations to describe the circuit.

CHAPTER 4. Techniques of Circuit Analysis
[d] We must avoid using the topmost mesh and the leftmost mesh. Each of
these meshes contains a current source, and we have no way of
determining the voltage drop across a current source.
P 4.3 [a] There are eight circuit components, seven resistors and the voltage source.
Therefore there are eight unknown currents. However, the voltage source
and the R1 resistor are in series, so have the same current. The R4 and
R6 resistors are also in series, so have the same current. The R5 and R7
resistors are in series, so have the same current. Therefore, we only need
5 equations to ﬁnd the 5 distinct currents in this circuit.
[b]
There are three essential nodes in this circuit, identiﬁed by the boxes. At
two of these nodes you can write KCL equations that will be independent
of one another. A KCL equation at the third node would be dependent
on the ﬁrst two. Therefore there are two independent KCL equations.
[c] Sum the currents at any two of the three essential nodes a, b, and c. Using
nodes a and c we get
−i1 + i2 + i4 = 0;
i1 −i3 + i5 = 0.
[d] There are three meshes in this circuit: one on the left with the
components vs, R1, R2 and R3; one on the top right with components R2,
R4, and R6; and one on the bottom right with components R3, R5, and
R7. We can write KVL equations for all three meshes, giving a total of
three independent KVL equations.

At node b:

At node c:
i1 −i3 + i5 = 0.
[b] There are many possible solutions. For example, adding the equations at
nodes a and c gives the equation at node b:
(−i1 + i2 + i4) + (i1 −i3 + i5) = 0
so
i2 −i3 + i4 + i5 = 0.
This is the equation at node b with both sides multiplied by −1.

At node b:

At node c:
i1 −i3 −i5 = 0;
At node e:
i3 + i4 −i2 = 0.
Add the equations at nodes b and c to give

The 2 A source delivers 75 W.
[c] The choice of a reference node in part (b) resulted in one simple KCL
equation, while the choice of a reference node in part (a) resulted in a

Both methods give the same result but the choice of reference node in
part (b) yielded fewer equations to solve, so is the preferred method.

The supermesh equation is:

The supermesh constraint equation is :

Since these equations are uncoupled, each can be solved separately:
5i1 = 60
·. .
i1 = 60/5 = 12A;
15i2 = 90
·. .
i2 = 90/15 = 6A.
Since the currents are the same as in part (a), the power will be the same
as calculated in part (a). Thus, the power dissipated in the circuit is
again 1260 W.
[c] As noted in part (a), the 6 A source has zero voltage drop, so is equivalent
to a short circuit (which has no voltage drop by deﬁnition) carrying 6 A
of current, as in the circuit of part (b).

P 4.54 [a] If the mesh-current method is used, then the value of the lower left mesh
current is io = 0. This shortcut will simplify the set of KVL equations.
The node-voltage method has no equivalent simplifying shortcut, so the

P 4.55 [a] There are 4 essential nodes so using the node voltage method requires 3
KCL equations. There are 4 meshes, but the currents in two of those

and is thus the preferred analysis method.

CHAPTER 4. Techniques of Circuit Analysis
But if the power associated with the 4 A source is zero, the voltage drop
across the source must be zero. This means that the voltage drop across
the 15 ⌦resistor is also zero, so the 15 ⌦resistor is e↵ectively removed
from the circuit. Once this happens, i2 = −4 A. Substitute this value
into the ﬁrst equation and solve for i1:
32i1 −20(−4) = 240
·. .
32i1 = 160
so
i1 = 5A.
Now substitute this value for i1 into the second equation and solve for idc:
−20(5) + 125(−4) + 50idc = −60
so
50idc = −60 + 100 + 500 = 540;

idc = 540/50 = 10.8A.

currents. Use the mesh current method to minimize the number of

Place the equations in standard form:

=
25;
i1(−1000) + i2(5000 + 1000 + 1000)
=

Solving, i1 = 6 mA;
i2 = 8 mA
Find the power in the 1 k⌦resistor:
i1k = i1 −i2 = −2 mA;
p1k = (−0.002)2(1000) = 4 mW.
[c] No, the voltage across the 10 A current source is readily available from the
mesh currents, and solving two simultaneous mesh-current equations is
less work than solving three node voltage equations.
[d] vg = 2000i1 + 1000i2 = 12 + 8 = 20 V;
p10mA = −(20)(0.01) = −200 mW.
Thus the 10 mA source develops 200 mW.

the three simultaneous equations for one unknown voltage provided the
connection at either the top or bottom of the circuit is used as the

Therefore, the 10 mA source is developing 133.33 mW.
P 4.58 [a] The node voltage method requires summing the currents at two
supernodes in terms of four node voltages and using two constraint
equations to reduce the system of equations to two unknowns. If the
connection at the bottom of the circuit is used as the reference node,
then the voltages controlling the dependent sources are node voltages.
This makes it easy to formulate the constraint equations. The current in
the 20 V source is obtained by summing the currents at either terminal of
the source.
The mesh current method requires summing the voltages around the two
meshes not containing current sources in terms of four mesh currents. In
addition the voltages controlling the dependent sources must be
expressed in terms of the mesh currents. Thus the constraint equations

are more complicated, and the reduction to two equations and two
unknowns involves more algebraic manipulation. The current in the 20 V
source is found by subtracting two mesh currents.
Because the constraint equations are easier to formulate in the node
voltage method, it is the preferred approach.

io = 0.2 −v2

P 4.101 [a] In studying the circuit in Fig. P4.101 we note it contains six meshes and
six essential nodes. Further study shows that by replacing the parallel
resistors with their equivalent values the circuit reduces to four meshes
and four essential nodes as shown in the following diagram.

CHAPTER 4. Techniques of Circuit Analysis
The node-voltage approach will require solving three node voltage
equations along with equations involving vx, vy, and ix.
The mesh-current approach will require writing one mesh equation and
one supermesh equation plus ﬁve constraint equations involving the ﬁve
sources. Thus at the outset we know the supermesh equation can be
reduced to a single unknown current. Since we are interested in the
power developed by the 50 V source, we will retain the mesh current ib
and eliminate the mesh currents ia, ic and id.
The supermesh is denoted by the dashed line in the following ﬁgure.
[b] Summing the voltages around the supermesh yields
−1.25vx + (100/3)ia + (200/3)ib + 50 + 50ib + 250(ic −id) + 50ic = 0.
The remaining mesh equation is
50ix + 350id −250ic = 0.
The constraint equations are
vy
25 = ib −ic;
0.9 = ic −ia;
vx = −(200/3)ib;
vy = 50ib;
ix = ic −id.
Solving,
ia = −0.3 A;
ib = −0.6 A;
ic = 0.6 A;
id = 0.4 A.
Finally,
p50V = 50ib = −30 W.
The 50 V source delivers 30 W of power.

Thus, v2 = 90 + 12.5 = 102.5 V.

The Operational Ampliﬁer
Assessment Problems
AP 5.1 [a] Derive the expression for the output voltage using circuit analysis:

vo = −5vs;

vo( V)

−15.0
3.0
8.0
10.0;
Two of the values, 3.5 V and −2.4 V, cause the op amp to saturate.
[b] Use the negative power supply value to determine the largest input
voltage:
−15 = −5vs,
vs = 3 V.
Use the positive power supply value to determine the smallest input
voltage:
10 = −5vs,
vs = −2 V;
Therefore
−2 V vs 3 V.
AP 5.2 From Assessment Problem 5.1
vo = (−Rf/Ri)vs = (−Rx/16,000)vs = (−Rx/16,000)(−0.640)
= 0.64Rx/16,000 = 4 ⇥10−5Rx.
Use the negative power supply value to determine one limit on the value of Rx:
4 ⇥10−5Rx = −15
so
Rx = −15/4 ⇥10−5 = −375 k⌦.
5–1

5–2
CHAPTER 5. The Operational Ampliﬁer
Since we cannot have negative resistor values, the lower limit for Rx is 0. Now
use the positive power supply value to determine the upper limit on the value
of Rx:
4 ⇥10−5Rx = 10
so
Rx = 10/4 ⇥10−5 = 250 k⌦.
Therefore,
0 Rx 250 k⌦.
AP 5.3 [a] This is an inverting summing ampliﬁer so
vo = (−Rf/Ra)va + (−Rf/Rb)vb = −(250/5)va −(250/25)vb = −50va −10vb
Substituting the values for va and vb:
vo = −50(0.1) −10(0.25) = −5 −2.5 = −7.5 V.
[b] Substitute the value for vb into the equation for vo from part (a) and use
the negative power supply value:
vo = −50va −10(0.25) = −50va −2.5 = −10 V.
Therefore
50va = 7.5,
so
va = 0.15 V.
[c] Substitute the value for va into the equation for vo from part (a) and use
the negative power supply value:
vo = −50(0.10) −10vb = −5 −10vb = −10 V;
Therefore
10vb = 5,
so
vb = 0.5 V.
[d] The e↵ect of reversing polarity is to change the sign on the vb term in
each equation from negative to positive.
Repeat part (a):
vo = −50va + 10vb = −5 + 2.5 = −2.5 V.
Repeat part (b):
vo = −50va + 2.5 = −10 V;
50va = 12.5,
va = 0.25 V.
Repeat part (c), using the value of the positive power supply:
vo = −5 + 10vb = 15 V;
10vb = 20;
vb = 2.0 V.
AP 5.4 [a] Write a node voltage equation at vn; remember that for an ideal op amp,
the current into the op amp at the inputs is zero:
vn
4500 + vn −vo
63,000 = 0.

Problems
5–3
Solve for vo in terms of vn by multiplying both sides by 63,000 and
collecting terms:
14vn + vn −vo = 0
so
vo = 15vn.
Now use voltage division to calculate vp. We can use voltage division
because the op amp is ideal, so no current ﬂows into the non-inverting
input terminal and the 400 mV divides between the 15 k⌦resistor and
the Rx resistor:
vp =
Rx
15,000 + Rx
(0.400.)
Now substitute the value Rx = 60 k⌦:
vp =
60,000
15,000 + 60,000(0.400) = 0.32 V.
Finally, remember that for an ideal op amp, vn = vp, so substitute the
value of vp into the equation for v0
vo = 15vn = 15vp = 15(0.32) = 4.8 V.
[b] Substitute the expression for vp into the equation for vo and set the
resulting equation equal to the positive power supply value:
vo = 15
 
0.4Rx
15,000 + Rx
!
= 5;
15(0.4Rx) = 5(15,000 + Rx)
so
Rx = 75 k⌦.
AP 5.5 [a] Since this is a di↵erence ampliﬁer, we can use the expression for the
output voltage in terms of the input voltages and the resistor values
given in Eq. 5.22:
vo = 20(60)
10(24)vb −50
10va.
Simplify this expression and subsitute in the value for vb:
vo = 5(vb −va) = 20 −5va.
Set this expression for vo to the positive power supply value:
20 −5va = 10 V
so
va = 2 V.
Now set the expression for vo to the negative power supply value:
20 −5va = −10 V
so
va = 6 V;
Therefore
2 va 6 V.

CHAPTER 5. The Operational Ampliﬁer
[b] Begin as before by substituting the appropriate values into Eq. 5.8:
vo = 8(60)
10(12)vb −5va = 4vb −5va.
Now substitute the value for vb:
vo = 4(4) −5va = 16 −5va.
Set this expression for vo to the positive power supply value:
16 −5va = 10 V
so
va = 1.2 V.
Now set the expression for vo to the negative power supply value:
16 −5va = −10 V
so
va = 5.2 V;
Therefore
1.2 va 5.2 V.
AP 5.6 Ra = Rc = 1.5 ⌦;
Rb = 12 ⌦.
Then,
Acm = 1.5Rd −1.5(12)
1.5(1.5 + Rd
;
Adm = Rd(13.5) + 12(1.5 + Rd)

Set the CMRR equal to 100 and solve for Rd:
CMRR = Adm
Acm
=
Rd(13.5) + 12(1.5 + Rd)
3(1.5 + Rd)
1.5Rd −18
1.5(1.5 + Rd)

3Rd −36
= 100.
Therefore,
Rd = 13.18 kV.
Set the CMRR equal to −100 and solve for Rd:
CMRR = 25.5Rd + 18
3Rd −36
= −100.
Therefore,
Rd = 11 kV.
Thus,
11 kV Rd 13.18 kV.

AP 5.7 [a] Replace the op amp with the more realistic model of the op amp from Fig.

Write the node voltage equation at the left hand node:
vn
500,000 + vn −vg
5000

100,000 = 0.
Multiply both sides by 500,000 and simplify:
vn + 100vn −100vg + 5vn −5v0 = 0
so
21.2vn −vo = 20vg.
Write the node voltage equation at the right hand node:
vo −300,000(−vn)
5000

100,000 = 0.
Multiply through by 100,000 and simplify:
20vo + 6 ⇥106vn + vo −vn = 0

CHAPTER 5. The Operational Ampliﬁer
[c] The resistance seen at the input to the op amp is the ratio of the input
voltage to the input current, so calculate the input current as a function
of the input voltage:
ig = vg −vn
5000

Solve for the ratio of vg to ig to get the input resistance:
Rg = vg
ig

5000
1 −6.9995 ⇥10−5 = 5000.35 ⌦.

the ratio of the feedback resistance to the input resistance:
vo
vg

5000

Since this is now an ideal op amp, the voltage di↵erence between the two
input terminals is zero; since vp = 0, vn = 0
Since there is no current into the inputs of an ideal op amp, the
resistance seen by the input voltage source is the input resistance:
Rg = 5000 ⌦.

P 5.1
[a] The ﬁve terminals of the op amp are identiﬁed as follows:
[b] The input resistance of an ideal op amp is inﬁnite, which constrains the
value of the input currents to 0. Thus, in = 0 A.
[c] The open-loop voltage gain of an ideal op amp is inﬁnite, which constrains
the di↵erence between the voltage at the two input terminals to 0. Thus,
(vp −vn) = 0.
[d] Write a node voltage equation at vn:
vn −2.5

But vp = 0 and vn = vp = 0. Thus,

vo = −10 V.
P 5.2
[a] Let the value of the voltage source be vs:

10,000 + vn −vo
40,000 = 0.
But vn = vp = 0. Therefore,
vo = −40,000
10,000vs = −4vs.
When vs = −6 V, vo = −4(−6) = 24 V; saturates at vo = 15 V.
When vs = −3.5 V, vo = −4(−3.5) = 14 V.
When vs = −1.25 V, vo = −4(−1.25) = 5 V.
When vs = 1 V, vo = −4(1) = −4 V.
When vs = 2.4 V, vo = −4(2.4) = −9.6 V.
When vs = 5.4 V, vo = −4(5.4) = −21.6 V; saturates at vo = −15 V.
[b] −4vs = 15
so
vs = 15
−4 = −3.75 V;
−4vs = −15

The range of source voltages that avoids saturation is

Since the current into the inverting input terminal of an ideal op-amp is zero,
the voltage across the 3.3 M⌦resistor, positive on the left, is
(3.3 ⇥106)(2.5 ⇥10−6) or 8.25 V. Therefore the voltmeter reads −8.25 V.

[a] The gain of an inverting ampliﬁer is the negative of the ratio of the
feedback resistor to the input resistor. If the gain of the inverting
ampliﬁer is to be 2.5, the feedback resistor must be 2.5 times as large as
the input resistor. There are many possible designs that use a resistor
value chosen from Appendix H. We present one here that uses 3.3 k⌦
resistors. Use a single 3.3 k⌦resistor as the input resistor. Then
construct a network of 3.3 k⌦resistors whose equivalent resistance is
2.5(3.3) = 8.25 k⌦by connecting two resistors in parallel and connecting
the parallel resistors in series with two other resistors. The resulting
circuit is shown here:
[b] To amplify signals in the range −2 V to 3 V without saturating the op
amp, the power supply voltages must be greater than or equal to the
product of the input voltage and the ampliﬁer gain.
−2.5(−2) = 5 V
and
−2.5(3) = −7.5 V.
Thus, the power supplies should have values of −7.5 V and 5 V.

We want the following expression for the output voltage:
vo = −(8va + 4vb + 10vc + 6vd).
This is an inverting summing ampliﬁer, so each input voltage is ampliﬁed by a
gain that is the ratio of the feedback resistance to the resistance in the
forward path for the input voltage. Pick a feedback resistor with divisors of 8,
4, 10, and 6 – say 120 k⌦:

Solve for each input resistance value to yield the desired gain:

Ra = 120,000/8 = 15 k⌦
Rc = 120,000/10 = 12 k⌦;
Rb = 120,000/4 = 30 k⌦
Rd = 120,000/6 = 20 k⌦.
Now create the 5 resistor values needed from the realistic resistor values in
Appendix H. Note that Rf = 120 k⌦, Ra = 15 k⌦, and Rc = 12 k⌦are already
values from Appendix H. Create Rb = 30 k⌦by combining two 15 k⌦resistors
in series. Create Rd = 20 k⌦by combining two 10 k⌦resistors in series. Of
course there are many other acceptable possibilities. The ﬁnal circuit is shown
here:

va = 3.818 V.
Set vo to the negative power supply voltage and solve for va:

[c] As long as the op-amp is operating in its linear region iL is independent of
RL. From (b) we found the op-amp is operating in its linear region as
long as RL 6 k⌦. Therefore when RL = 6 k⌦the op-amp is saturated.
We can estimate the value of iL by assuming ip = in ⌧iL. Then
iL = 20/(4000 + 16,000) = 1 mA. To justify neglecting the current into
the op-amp assume the drop across the 50 k⌦resistor is negligible, since
the input resistance to the op-amp is at least 500 k⌦. Then

[d] Yes, the operational ampliﬁer serves several useful purposes:
• First, it enables the source to control 16 times as much power
delivered to the load resistor. When a small amount of power controls
a larger amount of power, we refer to it as power ampliﬁcation.
• Second, it allows the full source voltage to appear across the load
resistor, no matter what the source resistance. This is the voltage
follower function of the operational ampliﬁer.
• Third, it allows the load resistor voltage (and thus its current) to be
set without drawing any current from the input voltage source. This
is the current ampliﬁcation function of the circuit.

Simplify:

From the input,

Substituting into the equation written at the output,
20vo + 16vo −256,000(vg −vn) + vo −vn = 0.
Now let vg = 1 V; plug this value into both the input and output
equations and simplify into two simultaneous equations:
19.75vn −6.25vo = 1;
255,999vn + 37vo = 256,000.

P 6.29
[a] Combine a 470 pF capacitor and a 10 pF capacitor in parallel to get a 480
pF capacitor:
(470 p) in parallel with (10 p) = 470 p + 10 p = 480 pF.
[b] Create a 1200 nF capacitor as follows:
(1 µ) in parallel with (0.1 µ) in parallel with (0.1 µ)
= 1000 n + 100 n + 100 n = 1200 nF.
Create a second 1200 nF capacitor using the same three resistors. Place
these two 1200 nF in series:
(1200 n) in series with (1200 n) = (1200 n)(1200 n)
1200 n + 1200 n = 600 nF.
[c] Combine two 220 µF capacitors in series to get a 110 µF capacitor. Then
combine the series pair in parallel with a 10 µF capacitor to get 120 µF:
[(220 µ) in series with (220 µ)] in parallel with (10 µ)
= (220 µ)(220 µ)
220 µ + 220 µ + 10 µ = 120 µF.

When the switch is opened the induced voltage is negative at the dotted
terminal. Since the voltmeter kicks downscale, the induced voltage across the
voltmeter must be negative at its positive terminal. Therefore, the voltage is
negative at the positive terminal of the voltmeter.
Thus, the upper terminal of the unmarked coil has the same instantaneous
polarity as the dotted terminal. Therefore, place a dot on the upper terminal
of the unmarked coil.
P 6.43
[a] Dot terminal 2; the ﬂux is up in coil 1-2, and right-to-left in coil 3-4.
Assign the current into terminal 4; the ﬂux is right-to-left in coil 3-4.

[b] Dot terminal 1; the ﬂux is down in coil 1-2, and down in coil 3-4. Assign
the current into terminal 4; the ﬂux is down in coil 3-4. Therefore, dot
terminal 4. Hence, 1 and 4 or 2 and 3.

When the touchscreen in the mutual-capacitance design is touched at the point

way that resistances combine in parallel. The resulting mutual capacitance is

P 6.52
[a] The self-capacitance and the touch capacitance are e↵ectively connected in
parallel. Therefore, the capacitance at the x-grid electrode closest to the
touch point with respect to ground is

The same capacitance exists at the y-grid electrode closest to the touch
point with respect to ground.

[c] In the self-capacitance design, touching the screen increases the
capacitance being measured at the point of touch. For example, in part
(a) the measured capacitance before the touch is 30 pF and after the
touch is 45 pF. In the mutual-capacitance design, touching the screen
decreases the capacitance being measured at the point of touch. For
example, in part (b) the measured capacitance before the touch is 30 pF
and after the touch is 10 pF.

Assessment Problems
AP 7.1 [a] The circuit for t < 0 is shown below. Note that the inductor behaves like a
short circuit, e↵ectively eliminating the 2 ⌦resistor from the circuit.
First combine the 30 ⌦and 6 ⌦resistors in parallel:
30k6 = 5 ⌦.
Use voltage division to ﬁnd the voltage drop across the parallel resistors:

Now ﬁnd the current using Ohm’s law:

[b] w(0) = 1
2Li2(0) = 1
2(8 ⇥10−3)(12.5)2 = 625 mJ.
[c] To ﬁnd the time constant, we need to ﬁnd the equivalent resistance seen

remains connected to the inductor. Thus,

Using current division,

Use the initial inductor current and the time constant to ﬁnd the current

t ≥0.
Use current division to ﬁnd the current in the 10 ⌦resistor:
io(t) =

4 + 10 + 6(−i) = 4
20(−4e−10t) = −0.8e−10t A,

AP 7.3 [a] The circuit for t < 0 is shown below. Note that the capacitor behaves like
an open circuit.
Find the voltage drop across the open circuit by ﬁnding the voltage drop
across the 50 k⌦resistor. First use current division to ﬁnd the current
through the 50 k⌦resistor:
i50k =
80 ⇥103
80 ⇥103 + 20 ⇥103 + 50 ⇥103(7.5 ⇥10−3) = 4 mA.
Use Ohm’s law to ﬁnd the voltage drop:
v(0−) = (50 ⇥103)i50k = (50 ⇥103)(0.004) = 200 V.
[b] To ﬁnd the time constant, we need to ﬁnd the equivalent resistance seen
by the capacitor for t > 0. When the switch opens, only the 50 k⌦
resistor remains connected to the capacitor. Thus,
⌧= RC = (50 ⇥103)(0.4 ⇥10−6) = 20 ms.

2(0.4 ⇥10−6)(200e−50t)2 = 8e−100t mJ.
The initial energy is 8 mJ, so when 75% is dissipated, 2 mJ remains:

e100t = 4,
t = (ln 4)/100 = 13.86 ms.

CHAPTER 7. Response of First-Order RL and RC Circuits
Find the current in the loop and use it to ﬁnd the initial voltage drops
across the two RC circuits:
i =
15
75,000 = 0.2 mA,
v5(0−) = 4 V,
v1(0−) = 8 V.
There are two time constants in the circuit, one for each RC subcircuit.
⌧5 is the time constant for the 5 µF – 20 k⌦subcircuit, and ⌧1 is the time
constant for the 1 µF – 40 k⌦subcircuit:
⌧5 = (20⇥103)(5⇥10−6) = 100 ms;
⌧1 = (40⇥103)(1⇥10−6) = 40 ms.
Therefore,
v5(t) = v5(0−)e−t/⌧5 = 4e−t/0.1 = 4e−10t V,
t ≥0;
v1(t) = v1(0−)e−t/⌧1 = 8e−t/0.04 = 8e−25t V,
t ≥0.
Finally,
vo(t) = v1(t) + v5(t) = [8e−25t + 4e−10t] V,
t ≥0.
[b] Find the value of the voltage at 60 ms for each subcircuit and use the
voltage to ﬁnd the energy at 60 ms:
v1(60 ms) = 8e−25(0.06) ⇠= 1.79 V,
v5(60 ms) = 4e−10(0.06) ⇠= 2.20 V;
w1(60 ms) = 1
2Cv2
1(60 ms) = 1
2(1 ⇥10−6)(1.79)2 ⇠= 1.59 µJ;
w5(60 ms) = 1
2Cv2
5(60 ms) = 1
2(5 ⇥10−6)(2.20)2 ⇠= 12.05 µJ;
w(60 ms) = 1.59 + 12.05 = 13.64 µJ.
Find the initial energy from the initial voltage:
w(0) = w1(0) + w2(0) = 1
2(1 ⇥10−6)(8)2 + 1
2(5 ⇥10−6)(4)2 = 72 µJ.
Now calculate the energy dissipated at 60 ms and compare it to the
initial energy:
wdiss = w(0) −w(60 ms) = 72 −13.64 = 58.36 µJ;
% dissipated = (58.36 ⇥10−6/72 ⇥10−6)(100) = 81.05 %.
AP 7.5 [a] Use the circuit at t < 0, shown below, to calculate the initial current in
the inductor:
i(0−) = 24/2 = 12 A = i(0+).
Note that i(0−) = i(0+) because the current in an inductor is continuous.
[b] Use the circuit at t = 0+, shown below, to calculate the voltage drop
across the inductor at 0+. Note that this is the same as the voltage drop
across the 10 ⌦resistor, which has current from two sources — 8 A from
the current source and 12 A from the initial current through the inductor.

v(0+) = −10(8 + 12) = −200 V.
[c] To calculate the time constant we need the equivalent resistance seen by
the inductor for t > 0. Only the 10 ⌦resistor is connected to the inductor
for t > 0. Thus,
⌧= L/R = (200 ⇥10−3/10) = 20 ms.
[d] To ﬁnd i(t), we need to ﬁnd the ﬁnal value of the current in the inductor.
When the switch has been in position a for a long time, the circuit
reduces to the one below:
Note that the inductor behaves as a short circuit and all of the current
from the 8 A source ﬂows through the short circuit. Thus,
if = −8 A.
Now,
i(t) = if + [i(0+) −if]e−t/⌧= −8 + [12 −(−8)]e−t/0.02
= −8 + 20e−50t A,
t ≥0.
[e] To ﬁnd v(t), use the relationship between voltage and current for an
inductor:
v(t) = Ldi(t)
dt
= (200 ⇥10−3)(−50)(20e−50t) = −200e−50t V,
t ≥0+.
AP 7.6 [a]
From Example 7.6,
vo(t) = −60 + 90e−100t V.
Write a KCL equation at the top node and use it to ﬁnd the relationship
between vo and vA:
vA −vo

vA
160,000 + vA + 75
40,000 = 0;
20vA −20vo + vA + 4vA + 300 = 0;
25vA = 20vo −300;
vA = 0.8vo −12.
Use the above equation for vA in terms of vo to ﬁnd the expression for vA:
vA(t) = 0.8(−60 + 90e−100t) −12 = −60 + 72e−100t V,
t ≥0+.

AP 7.10 [a] Prior to switch a closing at t = 0, there are no sources connected to the
inductor; thus, i(0−) = 0.
At the instant A is closed, i(0+) = 0.
For 0 t 1 s,
The equivalent resistance seen by the 10 V source is 2 + (3k0.8). The
current leaving the 10 V source is

2 + (3k0.8) = 3.8 A.

The ﬁnal current in the inductor, which is equal to the current in the
0.8 ⌦resistor is
IF =

Therefore,

For part (b) we need the value of i(t) at t = 1 s:
i(1) = 3 −3e−0.5 = 1.18 A.

[b] For t > 1 s
Use current division to ﬁnd the ﬁnal value of the current:

Opening the inductive circuit causes a very large voltage to be induced across
the inductor L. This voltage also appears across the switch (part [d] of
Problem 7.41), causing the switch to arc over. At the same time, the large
voltage across L damages the meter movement.

[c] The output voltage will also repeat. This follows from the observation that
at t = 4 µs the output voltage is zero, hence there is no energy stored in
the capacitor. This means the circuit is in the same state at t = 4 µs as it
was at t = 0, thus as vg repeats itself, so will vo.

[a] T2 is normally ON since its base current ib2 is greater than zero, i.e.,
ib2 = VCC/R when T2 is ON. When T2 is ON, vce2 = 0, therefore ib1 = 0.
When ib1 = 0, T1 is OFF. When T1 is OFF and T2 is ON, the capacitor C
is charged to VCC, positive at the left terminal. This is a stable state;
there is nothing to disturb this condition if the circuit is left to itself.
[b] When S is closed momentarily, vbe2 is changed to −VCC and T2 snaps
OFF. The instant T2 turns OFF, vce2 jumps to VCCR1/(R1 + RL) and ib1
jumps to VCC/(R1 + RL), which turns T1 ON.
[c] As soon as T1 turns ON, the charge on C starts to reverse polarity. Since
vbe2 is the same as the voltage across C, it starts to increase from −VCC
toward +VCC. However, T2 turns ON as soon as vbe2 = 0. The equation

[a] While T2 has been ON, C2 is charged to VCC, positive on the left terminal.
At the instant T1 turns ON the capacitor C2 is connected across b2 −e2,
thus vbe2 = −VCC. This negative voltage snaps T2 OFF. Now the polarity
of the voltage on C2 starts to reverse, that is, the right-hand terminal of
C2 starts to charge toward +VCC. At the same time, C1 is charging

toward VCC, positive on the right. At the instant the charge on C2
reaches zero, vbe2 is zero, T2 turns ON. This makes vbe1 = −VCC and T1
snaps OFF. Now the capacitors C1 and C2 start to charge with the
polarities to turn T1 ON and T2 OFF. This switching action repeats itself
over and over as long as the circuit is energized. At the instant T1 turns
ON, the voltage controlling the state of T2 is governed by the following
circuit:
It follows that vbe2 = VCC −2VCCe−t/R2C2.
[b] While T2 is OFF and T1 is ON, the output voltage vce2 is the same as the
voltage across C1, thus
It follows that vce2 = VCC −VCCe−t/RLC1.
[c] T2 will be OFF until vbe2 reaches zero. As soon as vbe2 is zero, ib2 will
become positive and turn T2 ON. vbe2 = 0 when VCC −2VCCe−t/R2C2 = 0,
or when t = R2C2 ln 2.
[d] When
t = R2C2 ln 2,
we have
vce2 = VCC −VCCe−[(R2C2 ln 2)/(RLC1)] = VCC −VCCe−10 ln 2 ⇠= VCC.

In the above equation, t is the number of seconds it takes to charge the
capacitor to 0.75VS, so it is a period. We want to calculate the heart rate,
which is a frequency in beats per minute, so H = 60/t. Thus,

CHAPTER 8. Natural and Step Responses of RLC Circuits
We know both v(0) and dv(0+)/dt will be real numbers. To facilitate the
algebra we let these numbers be K1 and K2, respectively. Then our two
simultaneous equations are
K1 = A1 + A2;
K2 = (−↵+ j!d)A1 + (−↵−j!d)A2.
The characteristic determinant is
∆=
'''''''
1
1
(−↵+ j!d) (−↵−j!d)
'''''''
= −j2!d.
The numerator determinants are
N1 =
'''''''
K1
1
K2 (−↵−j!d)
'''''''
= −(↵+ j!d)K1 −K2
and
N2 =
'''''''
1
K1
(−↵+ j!d) K2
'''''''
= K2 + (↵−j!d)K1.
It follows that
A1 = N1
∆= !dK1 −j(↵K1 + K2)
2!d
;
and
A2 = N2
∆= !dK1 + j(↵K1 + K2)
2!d
.
We see from these expressions that
A1 = A⇤
2.
P 8.23
By deﬁnition, B1 = A1 + A2. From the solution to Problem 8.22 we have
A1 + A2 = 2!dK1
2!d
= K1.
But K1 is v(0), therefore, B1 = v(0), which is identical to Eq. 8.16.
By deﬁnition, B2 = j(A1 −A2). From Problem 8.22 we have
B2 = j(A1 −A2) = j[−2j(↵K1 + K2)]
2!d
= ↵K1 + K2
!d
.
It follows that
K2 = −↵K1 + !dB2,
but
K2 = dv(0+)
dt
and
K1 = B1.

Hence the 37.5 mA current circulates between the current source and the ideal
inductor in the equivalent circuit. In the original circuit the 7.5 V source
sustains a current of 37.5 mA in the inductor. This is an example of a circuit
going directly into steady state when the switch is closed. There is no
transient period, or interval.

At t = 0 the voltage across each capacitor is zero. It follows that since the
operational ampliﬁers are ideal, the current in the 500 k⌦is zero. Therefore
there cannot be an instantaneous change in the current in the 1 µF capacitor.
Since the capacitor current equals C(dvo/dt), the derivative must be zero.

Therefore the addition of the 10 m⌦resistance does not change the
frequency of oscillation.
[d] Because of the added resistance, the oscillation now occurs within a
decaying exponential envelope (see Fig. 8.9). The form of the
exponential envelope is e−↵t = e−106t. Let’s assume that the oscillation is
described by the function Ke−106t cos 1010t, where the maximum
magnitude, K, exists at t = 0. How long does it take before the
magnitude of the oscillation has decayed to 0.01K?
Ke−106t = 0.01K
so
e−106t = 0.01;
·. .
t = ln 0.01
−106 = 4.6 ⇥10−6 s = 4.6 µs.
Therefore, the oscillations will persist for only 4.6 µs, due to the presence
of a small amount of resistance in the circuit. This is why an LC
oscillator is not used in the clock generator circuit.

Solving these equations for VTh gives VTh = 10/45◦V. To ﬁnd the Th´evenin

1 + j!RC −!2LC
= (R + j!L)(1 −!2LC −j!RC)
(1 + !2LC)2 + !2R2C2

The denominator in the above expression is purely real, so set the
imaginary part of the expression’s numerator to zero and solve for !:

[a] In order for vg and ig to be in phase, the impedance to the right of the
500 ⌦resistor must be purely real:
Zeq = j!Lk(R + 1/!C) = j!L(R + 1/j!C)
j!L + R + 1/j!C

j!L(j!RC + 1)
j!RC −!2LC + 1
=
(−!2RLC + j!L)(1 −!2LC −j!RC)
(1 −!2LC + j!RC)(1 −!2LC −j!RC).
The denominator of the above expression is purely real. Now set the
imaginary part of the numerator in that expression to zero and solve for
!:
!L(1 −!2LC) + !3R2LC2 = 0.

The circuit with the mesh currents identiﬁed is shown below:
The mesh current equations are:
−(15 + j20) −j50I1 + 150(I1 −I2) = 0;
15 + j10 + 150(I2 −I1) + j20I2 = 0.
In standard form:
I1(150 −j50) + I2(−150) = 15 + j20;
I1(−150) + I2(150 + j20) = −(15 + j10).
Solving on a calculator yields:

Thus,

[a] To ﬁnd the power used by an appliance, divide the yearly kW-hours used
by the product of the number of hours per month used and the number
of months:
central AC = 1080 k
(120)(3) = 3000 W;
dishwasher =
293 k
(30)(12) = 813.89 W;
refrigerator =
533 k
(720)(12) = 61.7 W;
microwave = 101 k
(9)(12) = 935.2 W.
The total power consumed by these four appliances is
P4 = 3000 + 813.89 + 61.7 + 035.2 = 4810.76 W.
When 120 V(rms) is used, the amount of current required is
I4 = 4810.8
120
= 40.1 A(rms).
Therefore, the 50 A current breaker will not interrupt the current.

Balanced Three-Phase Circuits
Assessment Problems
AP 11.1 Make a sketch:
We know VAN and wish to ﬁnd VBC. To do this, write a KVL equation to
ﬁnd VAB, and use the known phase angle relationship between VAB and VBC
to ﬁnd VBC.
VAB = VAN + VNB = VAN −VBN.
Since VAN, VBN, and VCN form a balanced set, and VAN = 240/−30◦V, and
the phase sequence is positive,
VBN = |VAN|//VAN −120◦= 240/−30◦−120◦= 240/−150◦V.
Then,
VAB = VAN −VBN = (240/−30◦) −(240/−150◦) = 415.46/0◦V.
Since VAB, VBC, and VCA form a balanced set with a positive phase sequence,
we can ﬁnd VBC from VAB:
VBC = |VAB|/(/VAB −120◦) = 415.69/0◦−120◦= 415.69/−120◦V.

CHAPTER 11. Balanced Three-Phase Circuits
Thus,
VBC = 415.69/−120◦V.
AP 11.2 Make a sketch:
We know VCN and wish to ﬁnd VAB. To do this, write a KVL equation to
ﬁnd VBC, and use the known phase angle relationship between VAB and VBC
to ﬁnd VAB.
VBC = VBN + VNC = VBN −VCN.
Since VAN, VBN, and VCN form a balanced set, and VCN = 450/−25◦V, and
the phase sequence is negative,
VBN = |VCN|//VCN −120◦= 450/−23◦−120◦= 450/−145◦V.
Then,
VBC = VBN −VCN = (450/−145◦) −(450/−25◦) = 779.42/−175◦V.
Since VAB, VBC, and VCA form a balanced set with a negative phase
sequence, we can ﬁnd VAB from VBC:
VAB = |VBC|//VBC −120◦= 779.42/−295◦V.
But we normally want phase angle values between +180◦and −180◦. We add
360◦to the phase angle computed above. Thus,
VAB = 779.42/65◦V

Problems

[a] We can ﬁnd the line current using Ohm’s law, since the a-phase line
current is the current in the a-phase load. Then we can use the fact that
IaA, IbB, and IcC form a balanced set to ﬁnd the remaining line currents.
Note that since we were not given any phase angles in the problem
statement, we can assume that the phase voltage given, VAN, has a phase
angle of 0◦.
2400/0◦= IaA(16 + j12)
so
IaA = 2400/0◦
16 + j12 = 96 −j72 = 120/−36.87◦A.
With an acb phase sequence,
/IbB = /IaA + 120◦
and
/IcC = /IaA −120◦
so
IaA = 120/−36.87◦A;
IbB = 120/83.13◦A;
IcC = 120/−156.87◦A.
[b] The line voltages at the source are Vab Vbc, and Vca. They form a
balanced set. To ﬁnd Vab, use the a-phase circuit to ﬁnd VAN, and use
the relationship between phase voltages and line voltages for a
y-connection (see Fig. 11.9[b]). From the a-phase circuit, use KVL:
Van = VaA + VAN = (0.1 + j0.8)IaA + 2400/0◦
= (0.1 + j0.8)(96 −j72) + 2400/0◦= 2467.2 + j69.6
= 2468.18/1.62◦V.
From Fig. 11.9(b),
Vab = Van(
p
3/−30◦) = 4275.02/−28.38◦V.
With an acb phase sequence,
/Vbc = /Vab + 120◦
and
/Vca = /Vab −120◦
so
Vab = 4275.02/−28.38◦V;
Vbc = 4275.02/91.62◦V;
Vca = 4275.02/−148.38◦V.

Problems

Note that these three voltages form a balanced set with an abc phase
sequence. First, use KVL to ﬁnd VAB:
VAB = VAN + VNB = VAN −VBN
= (169.71/26◦) −(169.71/−94◦) = 293.95/56◦V.
With an abc phase sequence,
/VBC = /VAB −120◦
and
/VCA = /VAB + 120◦
so
VAB = 293.95/56◦V;
VBC = 293.95/−64◦V;
VCA = 293.95/176◦V.
To get back to the time domain, perform an inverse phasor transform of the
three line voltages, using a frequency of !:
vAB(t) = 293.95 cos(!t + 56◦) V;
vBC(t) = 293.95 cos(!t −64◦) V;
vCA(t) = 293.95 cos(!t + 176◦) V.

CHAPTER 11. Balanced Three-Phase Circuits
P 11.11 Make a sketch of the three-phase line and load:
Z` = 0.25 + j2 ⌦/φ;
ZL = 30.48 + j22.86 ⌦/φ.
[a] The line currents are IaA, IbB, and IcC. To ﬁnd IaA, ﬁrst ﬁnd VAN and use
Ohm’s law for the a-phase load impedance. Since we are only concerned
with ﬁnding voltage and current magnitudes, the phase sequence doesn’t
matter and we arbitrarily assume a positive phase sequence. Since we are
not given any phase angles in the problem statement, we can assume the
angle of VAB is 0◦. Use Fig. 11.9(a) to ﬁnd VAN from VAB.
VAN = 660
p
3
/(0 −30◦) = 381.05/−30◦V.
Now ﬁnd IaA using Ohm’s law:
IaA = VAN
ZL
= 381.05/−30◦
30.48 + j22.86 = 8 −j6 = 10/−36.87◦V.
Thus, the magnitude of the line current is
|IaA| = 10 A.
[b] The line voltage at the source is Vab. From KVL on the top loop of the
three-phase circuit,
Vab = VaA + VAB + VBb
= Z`IaA + VAB + Z`IBb
= Z`IaA + VAB −Z`IbB
= (0.25 + j2)(10/−36.87◦) + 660/0◦−(0.25 + j2)(10/−156.87◦)
= 669.3/2.9◦V.
Thus, the magnitude of the line voltage at the source is
|Vab| = 669.3 V.

[c] The phase voltage at the load in the a-phase is VAN. Calculate its value
using IaA and the load impedance:
VAN = IaAZL = (4 −j3)(19.9 + j14.2) = 122.2 −j2.9 = 122.23/−1.36◦V (rms).

The total instantaneous power is pT = pa + pb + pc, so
pT = VmIm[cos !t cos(!t −✓φ) + cos(!t −120◦) cos(!t −✓φ −120◦)
+ cos(!t + 120◦) cos(!t −✓φ + 120◦)].
Now simplify using trigonometric identities. In simplifying, collect the
coeﬃcients of cos(!t −✓φ) and sin(!t −✓φ). We get
pT = VmIm[cos !t(1 + 2 cos2 120◦) cos(!t −✓φ)
+2 sin !t sin2 120◦sin(!t −✓φ)]

Yes. The initial inductor current is zero by hypothesis, the initial resistor
current is zero because the initial capacitor voltage is zero by hypothesis.
Thus at t = 0 the source current appears in the capacitor.

Since i1 is a dc current at t = 1 there is no voltage induced in the 10 H
inductor; hence, i2 = 0. Also note that i1(0) = 0 and i2(0) = 0. Thus our
solutions satisfy the condition of no initial energy stored in the circuit.

iL(ss)(t) = 36.69 cos(120⇡t + 56.61◦) mA.
[b] The steady-state response is the second term in the expression for iL(t)
derived in the Practical Perspective. This matches the steady-state
response just derived in part (a).
P 12.57 The transient and steady-state components are both proportional to the
magnitude of the input voltage. Therefore,
K =
40
42.26 = 0.947.
So if we make the amplitude of the sinusoidal source 0.947 instead of 1, the
current will not exceed the 40 mA limit. A plot of the current through the
inductor is shown below with the amplitude of the sinusoidal source set at
0.947.
P 12.58 We begin by using the Laplace transform of the describing di↵erential
equation for the circuit in Fig. 12.19. Change the right-hand side so it is the

Plot the expression above with K = 1:
The maximum value of the inductor current is 0.068K mA. Therefore,
K =

0.068 = 588.
So the inductor current rating will not be exceeded if the input to the RLC

i2(max) = 1.25[e−0.549 −e−3(0.549)] = 481.13 mA.
[b] Solving the mesh current equations from Example 13.7 are
(3 + 2s)I1 + 2sI2 = 10;
and
2sI1 + (12 + 8s)I2 = 10.
Solving for I1,
I1 =
5(s + 2)
(s + 1)(s + 3).
A partial fraction expansion leads to the expression
I1 =

Therefore we get

AP 13.12 From Assessment Problem 13.9:

Therefore

Also

R1
= 0,
therefore
Vo = 2V1 −Vg.
Now solving for Vo/Vg, we get
H(s) = R2Cs −1
R2Cs + 1.
It follows that
H(j50,000) = j −1
j + 1 = j1 = 1/90.◦
Therefore
vo = 10 cos(50,000t + 90◦) V.
[b] Replacing R2 by Rx gives us
H(s) = RxCs −1
RxCs + 1.
Therefore
H(j50,000) = j20 ⇥10−6Rx −1
j20 ⇥10−6Rx + 1 = Rx + j50,000
Rx −j50,000.

[e] Calculating the time when the capacitor voltage drop ﬁrst reaches 1000 V:
30t + 20 −20e−3t = 1000
or
30t −40 + 40e−3t = 1000.
Note that in either of these expressions the exponential tem is negligible
when compared to the other terms. Thus,
30t + 20 = 1000
or
30t −40 = 1000.
Thus,
t = 980
30 = 32.67 s
or
t = 1040
30
= 34.67 s.
Therefore, the breakdown will occur at t = 32.67 s.

Problems

vo = 20 cos(2t −90◦) = 20 sin 2t;
vo = [20 sin 2t]u(t) V.
[d] Let us begin by noting i1 jumps from 0 to (80/3) A between 0−and 0+
and in this same interval i2 jumps from 0 to (40/3) A. Therefore in the
derivatives of i1 and i2 there will be impulses of (80/3)δ(t) and
(40/3)δ(t), respectively. Thus
di1
dt = 80
3 δ(t) −40
3 sin 2t A/s;
di2
dt = 40
3 δ(t) −80
3 sin 2t A/s.
From the circuit diagram we have
20δ(t) = 1di1
dt −0.5di2
dt
= 80
3 δ(t) −40
3 sin 2t −20δ(t)
3
+ 40
3 sin 2t
= 20δ(t).
Thus our solutions for i1 and i2 are in agreement with known circuit
behavior.
Let us also note the impulsive voltage will impart energy into the circuit.
Since there is no resistance in the circuit, the energy will not dissipate.
Thus the fact that i1, i2, and vo exist for all time is consistent with
known circuit behavior.
Also note that although i1 has a dc component, i2 does not. This follows
from known transformer behavior.
Finally we note the ﬂux linkage prior to the appearance of the impulsive
voltage is zero. Now since v = dλ/dt, the impulsive voltage source must
be matched to an instantaneous change in ﬂux linkage at t = 0+ of 20.
For the given polarity dots and reference directions of i1 and i2 we have
λ(0+) = L1i1(0+) + Mi1(0+) −L2i2(0+) −Mi2(0+);
λ(0+) = 1

vo(t) = 1.01 cos(200,000t −88.84◦) V.
P 14.40 [a] In analyzing the circuit qualitatively we visualize vi as a sinusoidal voltage
and we seek the steady-state nature of the output voltage vo.
At zero frequency the inductor provides a direct connection between the
input and the output, hence vo = vi when ! = 0.
At inﬁnite frequency the capacitor provides the direct connection, hence
vo = vi when ! = 1.
At the resonant frequency of the parallel combination of L and C the
impedance of the combination is inﬁnite and hence the output voltage
will be zero when ! = !o.
At frequencies on either side of !o the amplitude of the output voltage
will be nonzero but less than the amplitude of the input voltage.

q
(5088.522 −5353.272)2 + [(5353.27)(1533.10)]2

It is not a coincidence that these two magnitudes are the same. The
frequencies in both bands of the DTMF system were carefully chosen to
produce this type of predictable behavior with linear ﬁlters. In other
words, the frequencies were chosen to be equally far apart with respect to
the response produced by a linear ﬁlter. Most musical scales consist of
tones designed with this dame property – note intervals are selected to
place the notes equally far apart. That is why the DTMF tones remind
us of musical notes! Unlike musical scales, DTMF frequencies were
selected to be harmonically unrelated, to lower the risk of misidentifying
a tone’s frequency if the circuit elements are not perfectly linear.
[c] The high-band frequency closest to the low-frequency band is 1209 Hz.
The amplitude of a tone with this frequency is
|V1209Hz| = |Vpeak| =
(7596.37)(1533.10)
q
(5088.522 −7596.372)2 + [(7596.37)(1533.10)]2
= 0.344|Vpeak|.
This is less than one half the amplitude of the signals with the low-band
cuto↵frequencies, ensuring adequate separation of the bands.
P 14.52 The cuto↵frequencies and bandwidth are
!c1 = 2⇡(1209) = 7596 rad/;s
!c2 = 2⇡(1633) = 10.26 krad/s;

Again it is not coincidental that this result is the same as the response of the
low-band ﬁlter to the lowest of the high-band frequencies.
P 14.53 From Problem 14.51 the response to the largest of the DTMF low-band tones
is 0.948|Vpeak|. The response to the 20 Hz tone is
|V20Hz| =
|Vpeak|(125.6)(1533)
[(50892 −125.62)2 + [(125.6)(1533)]2]1/2
= 0.00744|Vpeak|;

|V20Hz|
|V770Hz| = |V20Hz|
|V852Hz| = 0.00744|Vpeak|
0.948|Vpeak|

·. .
|V20Hz| = 63.7|V770Hz|.
Thus, the 20Hz signal can be 63.7 times as large as the DTMF tones.

[d] As ! ! 0 the two capacitor branches become open and the circuit reduces
to a resistive inverting ampliﬁer having a gain of −R2/R1.
As ! ! 1 the two capacitor branches approach a short circuit and in
this case we encounter an indeterminate situation; namely vn ! vi but
vn = 0 because of the ideal op amp. At the same time the gain of the
ideal op amp is inﬁnite so we have the indeterminate form 0 · 1.
Although ! = 1 is indeterminate we can reason that for ﬁnite large
values of ! H(j!) will approach −C1/C2 in value. In other words, the
circuit approaches a purely capacitive inverting ampliﬁer with a gain of
(−1/j!C2)/(1/j!C1) or −C1/C2.

[d] It is apparent from the calculations in part (c) that as n increases the
amplitude characteristic at the cuto↵frequency decreases at a much
faster rate for the Butterworth ﬁlter.
Hence the transition region of the Butterworth ﬁlter will be much
narrower than that of the cascaded sections.

[c] From the transfer function the gain is down 19.99 + 3.89 or 23.88 dB at
200 Hz. Because the upper cut-o↵frequency is nine times the lower
cut-o↵frequency we would expect the high-pass stage of the ﬁlter to
predict the loss in gain at 200 Hz. For a 3nd order Butterworth
GAIN = 20 log10

q
1 + (500/200)6 = −23.89 dB.
1500 Hz is in the passband for this bandpass ﬁlter. Hence we expect the
gain at 1500 Hz to nearly equal 20 dB as speciﬁed in Problem 15.44.
Thus our scaled transfer function conﬁrms that the ﬁlter meets the
speciﬁcations.

P 15.48 [a] At very low frequencies the two capacitor branches are open and because
the op amp is ideal the current in R3 is zero. Therefore at low frequencies
the circuit behaves as an inverting ampliﬁer with a gain of R2/R1. At
very high frequencies the capacitor branches are short circuits and hence
the output voltage is zero.

CHAPTER 15. Active Filter Circuits
For very small frequencies the capacitors behave as open circuits and
therefore vo is zero. As the frequency increases, the capacitive branch
impedances become small compared to the resistive branches. When this
happens the circuit becomes an inverting ampliﬁer with the capacitor C2
dominating the feedback path. Hence the gain of the ampliﬁer
approaches (1/j!C2)/(1/j!C1) or C1/C2. Therefore the circuit behaves
like a high-pass ﬁlter with a passband gain of C1/C2.
[b] Summing the currents away from the upper terminal of R2 yields
VaG2 + (Va −Vi)sC1 + (Va −Vo)sC2 + VasC3 = 0
or
Va[G2 + s(C1 + C2 + C3)] −VosC2 = sC1Vi.
Summing the currents away from the inverting input terminal gives
(0 −Va)sC3 + (0 −Vo)G1 = 0
or
sC3Va = −G1Vo;
Va = −G1Vo
sC3
.
Therefore we can write
−G1Vo
sC3
[G2 + s(C1 + C2 + C3)] −sC2Vo = sC1Vi.
Solving for Vo/Vi gives
H(s) = Vo

P 15.55 [a] Interchanging the Rs and Cs yields the following circuit.
At low frequencies the capacitors appear as open circuits and hence the
output voltage is zero. As the frequency increases the capacitor branches
approach short circuits and va = vi = vo. Thus the circuit is a unity-gain,
high-pass ﬁlter.
[b] The s-domain equations are
(Va −Vi)sC1 + (Va −Vo)G1 = 0;
(Vo −Va)sC2 + VoG2 = 0.
It follows that
Va(G1 + sC1) −G1Vo = sC1Vi
and Va = (G2 + sC2)Vo

[c] Since x and y are both at the same potential, they can be shorted together,
and the circuit in Fig. 15.34 can thus be drawn as shown in Fig. 15.64(c).
[d] The feedback path between Vo and Vs containing the resistance R4 + 2R3
has no e↵ect on the ratio Vo/Vs, as this feedback path is not involved in
the nodal equation that deﬁnes the voltage ratio. Thus, the circuit in
Fig. P15.64(c) can be simpliﬁed into the form of Fig. 15.2, where the
input impedance is the equivalent impedance of R1 in series with the
parallel combination of (1 −↵)/sC1 and (1 −↵)R2, and the feedback
impedance is the equivalent impedance of R1 in series with the parallel
combination of ↵/sC1 and ↵R2:

R3(R4 + Ro).
If R4 ≫Ro

Thus, when β = 1 we have ampliﬁcation or “boost”. When β = 0
|H(j1)|β=0 = R3(R4 + Ro)
Ro(R4 + R3).

CHAPTER 15. Active Filter Circuits
If R4 ≫Ro
|H(j1)|β=0 ⇠= R3
R0
< 1.
Thus, when β = 0 we have attenuation or “cut”.
Also note that when β = 0.5
|H(j!)|β=0.5 = (0.5R4 + Ro)(0.5R4 + R3)
(0.5R4 + R3)(0.5R4 + Ro) = 1.
Thus, the transition from ampliﬁcation to attenuation occurs at β = 0.5. If
β > 0.5 we have ampliﬁcation, and if β < 0.5 we have attenuation.
Also note the ampliﬁcation an attenuation are symmetric about β = 0.5. i.e.
|H(j!)|β=0.6 =
1
|H(j!)|β=0.4
.
Yes, the circuit can be used as a treble volume control because
• The circuit has no e↵ect on low frequency signals;
• Depending on β the circuit can either amplify (β > 0.5) or attenuate
(β < 0.5) signals in the treble range;
• The ampliﬁcation (boost) and attenuation (cut) are symmetric around
β = 0.5. When β = 0.5 the circuit has no e↵ect on signals in the treble
frequency range.

circuit designer knows that gain or cut will be within 3 dB of the

Now let t = x −T/2 in the ﬁrst integral, then dt = dx, x = 0 when t = −T/2

CHAPTER 17. The Fourier Transform
i60k(0+) = 30
60 = 0.5 mA;
io(0+) = 5.5 + 0.5 = 6 mA,
which agrees with our solution.
We also know io(1) = 0, which agrees with our solution.
The time constant with respect to the terminals of the capacitor is RThC
Thus,
⌧= (10,000)(2 ⇥10−6) = 20 ms;

This makes sense because there cannot be an instantaneous change in the
voltage across a capacitor.

P 17.33 [a]
From the plot of vg note that vg is −10 V for an inﬁnitely long time
before t = 0. Therefore
vo(0−) = −10 V.
There cannot be an instantaneous change in the voltage across a
capacitor, so
vo(0+) = −10 V.

Problems

From the circuit at t = 0+ we see that vo must be −800 V, which is
consistent with the solution for vo obtained in part (a).
It is informative to solve for either the current in the circuit or the
voltage across the capacitor and note the solutions for io and vC are
consistent with the solution for vo
The solutions are
io = 10e10tu(−t) + [20e−5t + 80e−20t −90e−10t]u(t) A;
vC = 100e10tu(−t) + [900e−10t −400e−5t −400e−20t]u(t) V.
