About the Author
Rod Powers joined the U.S. Air Force in 1975 intending to become a spy. He 
was devastated to learn that he should’ve joined the CIA instead because the 
military doesn’t have that particular enlisted job. Regardless, he fell in love 
with the military and made it both a passion and a career, retiring with 23 
years of service. Rod spent 11 of those years as a fi rst sergeant, helping to 
solve the problems of the enlisted corps.
During Rod’s military career, he traveled the world — twice. He’s been 
assigned or deployed to so many countries that he doesn’t even remember 
them all. He’s a veteran of the Korea “Tree War,” Grenada, Desert Shield, 
and Desert Storm. He’s a distinguished graduate of the Air Force Leadership 
School, the Noncommissioned Offi cer Academy, the Senior Noncommissioned 
Offi cer Academy, and the Air Force First Sergeant Academy.
Since his retirement from the military in 1998, Rod has become a world-
renowned military careers expert. Through hundreds of articles on his highly 
popular U.S. Military Information Web site at About.com (usmilitary.
about.com), Rod has advised thousands of troops about all aspects of U.S. 
armed forces careers. Veteran Beneﬁ ts For Dummies is his third military-related 
book. One of his other books, ASVAB For Dummies, was published by Wiley.
Rod is the proud single-parent father of twin girls, both of whom enjoy suc-
cessful careers in the U.S. Air Force. Rod currently lives in Daytona Beach, 
Florida, where he gratefully enjoys the devoted attentions of his girlfriend, 
Jackie, and his pet tomato plant, Oscar. Even today, Rod tries to run his life 
according to long-lived military ideals and standards, but he gets a bit con-
fused about why nobody will obey his orders anymore. Not even Oscar.

Author’s Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I offer my most sincere gratitude, appreciation, and 
respect to our nation’s veterans. Without your sacrifi ces, dedication, and loy-
alty to our country, this book, nor any freedom of expression, would not be 
possible.
Many thanks to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of 
Defense for their invaluable information and assistance. Special thanks to 
Scott Langhoff for reviewing the manuscript for technical accuracy and keep-
ing me informed on the latest changes to veterans benefi ts.
I am grateful to Barb Doyan, my literary agent, for her encouragement, sup-
port, and hard work in getting this project off the ground. Thanks to Mike 
Baker, acquisition editor at Wiley, and likewise to my project and copy edi-
tors, Natalie Harris and Vicki Adang, both editors par excellence. Their contri-
butions to this book cannot be overstated. 
Finally, to my girlfriend, Jackie Gatton, who stuck with me and had faith in 
me, even when I sometimes had to break a date to meet a deadline.

Introduction
I
f you’re reading this book, there’s a very good chance that you’re a mili-
tary veteran or you have a close friend or family member who is. Perhaps 
you’ve always wondered what our nation offers in the way of thanks to those 
who have defended our country, or perhaps you want the lowdown on a spe-
cific benefit you may have heard about.
Numerous benefits are available to those who have served our country. 
There are also many benefits available for family members of such veterans. 
However, it can be frustrating to look for information about specific benefits, 
including what the benefit is all about and who qualifies for it, when you have 
to decipher paragraphs and paragraphs full of government gobbledygook. 
You shouldn’t have to hire a lawyer to have a veterans benefit explained to 
you in order to figure out whether you qualify. If only there were a single 
resource that explained veterans benefits in clear, simple, everyday language.
That’s why I decided to write this book. I’ve spoken to hundreds of veterans 
across the country. Although most knew about veterans benefits, many didn’t 
believe they qualified for one reason or another, and many others had heard 
the horror stories of how the government and the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA) have screwed up the system so badly that it’s nearly impossible to 
apply for benefits.
I won’t lie to you. The VA’s record of benefits administration, in many cases, 
has been dismal. At the time of publication of this book, more than 512,000 
benefit claims are waiting to be processed, and more than 90,000 benefit 
appeals have not yet been decided. Gather together a group of veterans and 
ask them to talk about the problems they’ve had when dealing with the VA, 
and you may as well get comfortable. They’ll still be talking when the beer 
and chips run out.
But there’s good news. Most benefit claims are delayed or denied because the 
veteran didn’t fully understand the qualification criteria or failed to provide 
the correct documents and supporting evidence. That’s not the veteran’s 
fault. Wading through the pages and pages of legal language to find out how 
to submit a simple benefit claim can be a daunting task. That’s where Veterans 
Benefits For Dummies comes in. I explain each benefit in everyday terms, list 
the eligibility requirements, and let you know exactly what forms and support-
ing documents you need to gather to support your claim for benefits.

Veterans Benefits For Dummies 
About This Book
The full-disclosure doctrine requires that I inform you that you probably 
won’t find any new or secret information in this book. The information I pres-
ent here is readily available on both the VA and Department of Defense’s 
(DOD) massive Web sites, as well as in various federal laws, regulations, and 
other publications that are also available on the Internet.
So why should you spend some of your hard-earned money on this book? 
Because here you find all this information laid out in one place in a logical 
manner, with the details explained in a way that won’t give you a headache. 
Veterans Benefits For Dummies will save you loads of time, and think of all the 
money you’ll save on aspirin.
I’m not going to waste your time by pointing out what’s wrong with the 
system and what I think the government should do to fix it. I leave that to 
other authors. My goal is to help you understand the benefits, determine 
whether you qualify, and work within the current system so you can get the 
benefits you want and deserve.
Although you won’t read anything new here, I can absolutely, 100 percent 
fully guarantee that Veterans Benefits For Dummies contains enough valuable 
information to hold the covers apart.
Conventions Used in This Book
I include a lot of Web addresses where you can find the necessary forms 
to apply for benefits. (You can identify a Web address by its appearance in 
monofont.) When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have 
needed to break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I 
haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. 
So when using one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see 
in this book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
As you move through this book, you may encounter new terms. Wherever 
necessary, I define italicized terms for you.

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
This book has a number of sidebars (the shaded gray boxes) sprinkled 
throughout. They’re full of interesting information about benefit(s) described 
in that chapter, but you don’t have to read them if you don’t want to. They 
don’t contain anything you simply must know about the benefit(s).
You also run across special icons, titled Technical Stuff, from time to time. 
These paragraphs include concise, detailed information, which is usually 
interesting, but is a little more technical or in-depth about the topic at hand. 
You can skip these tidbits if you wish.
Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, I made a few assumptions about you — namely, who 
you are and why you picked up this book. I assume the following:
 
✓ You aren’t a dummy. You just want information about veterans benefits.
 
✓ You’re a veteran or the friend or family member of a veteran, and you’re 
interested in applying for a specific benefit or group of benefits.
 
✓ You’re tired of government bureaucratese and prefer your information 
in easy-to-take doses.
How This Book Is Organized
There’s a method to my madness, the reason why this book is organized the 
way you see it today. I’ve arranged this book according to subject matter. 
Benefits relating to pensions and finances are grouped together, benefits 
relating to education and employment are grouped together, and so on.
Part I: Benefiting From Benefits
If you’re not sure what a veteran is or whether you meet the basic qualifica-
tions for veterans, turn to this part. This part also tells you how to work with 
the VA and military service departments, how to gather your supporting 
documentation, and what to do if your claim for benefits is denied.

Veterans Benefits For Dummies 
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care 
and Compensation Programs
In Part II you find out how the DOD and the VA can take care of your medical 
needs and your pocketbook after your discharge or retirement from the U.S. 
military. You can read about the VA healthcare program, available to most 
veterans, and the DOD healthcare system, known as Tricare, for military 
retirees and their family members. You also get the lowdown on pensions for 
low-income veterans, compensation for disabilities, and military retired pay. 
There’s also information for families of deceased veterans, regarding survivor 
compensation, education, insurance, and medical programs, and how they 
can lay their loved ones to rest with the dignity and respect they deserve.
Part III: Understanding Education 
and Employment Programs
A free education is a terrible thing to waste. Part III explains how you can 
take full advantage of education programs available to veterans. Not only can 
you get a free college degree, but you may qualify for special vocational train-
ing programs available to certain disabled veterans.
After you’ve earned a degree or completed a training program, it’s time to 
enter the real world and earn a living. Many veterans qualify for special pref-
erence when applying for federal government jobs, so Part III also explains 
what you need to do to qualify for one of these positions. If you’d rather work 
for yourself, you can obtain a small business loan guarantee from the Small 
Business Administration.
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — 
Except When You’re Traveling!
This part tells you how the VA can help you get a low-interest loan to finance 
your dream house. It also informs you about services available to homeless 
veterans, and I outline how you can spend your golden years in a garden-spot 
military retirement home.
Also included in Part IV is valuable information about shopping on military 
bases and how you can spend your next vacation in a luxury condo or vaca-
tion resort available only to military members, certain veterans, and their 
family members. Part IV even tells you whether you qualify to fly around the 
world for free on military aircraft.

 Introduction
Part V: The Part of Tens
It wouldn’t be a For Dummies book if I didn’t include a Part of Tens. If you 
want to get right down to it and find out where you can get help with vet-
eran benefits, turn to Part V. I give you a list of organizations that can assist 
you on your benefits crusade. This part also has tips about improving your 
chances of getting your claim approved and some pointers for traveling on 
the military’s dime.
Part VI: Appendixes
Here you find contact information for state veterans offices, VA medical cen-
ters, cemeteries, vet centers, and regional offices.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book I’ve added icons to help you use the material to your 
best advantage. Here’s a rundown on what they mean:
 
This icon alerts you to helpful hints regarding the subject at hand. Tips can 
help you save time and avoid frustration.
 
This icon reminds you of important information you should read carefully.
 
This icon flags information that may prove hazardous to your plan of apply-
ing for a specific benefit. Often this icon accompanies common mistakes 
people make when applying for a veterans benefit. Pay special attention to the 
Warning icon so you don’t fall into one of these pitfalls.
 
This icon points out information that is interesting, enlightening, or in-depth 
but isn’t necessary for you to read. You don’t need this information to under-
stand or apply for a benefit, but knowing these facts may make you a better 
informed applicant.

Veterans Benefits For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to read this book from cover to cover to understand and 
apply for veterans benefits. You may be interested in a specific benefit, or 
only a few of the benefits. If so, feel free to read only those chapters that 
apply to the benefit(s) you’re interested in.
If you decide to skip around, look over the table of contents and choose your 
favorite benefit. You’ll find all the information you need to know about that 
benefit in the chapter indicated.
Before applying for a benefit, however, I do recommend that you read Chapters 
2 and 3. These chapters provide invaluable information about ensuring your 
eligibility status and getting your supporting documentation in order.
No matter where you start, I wish you all the best in getting the benefits 
you’ve earned. Thank you, from a fellow veteran, for your sacrifice and 
dedication to our country.

Benefit ing From 
Benefits

In this part . . .

f you’re like most veterans, you’re proud of your mili-
tary service and proud to call yourself a veteran. But 
the title of “veteran” and 35 cents will buy you much more 
than a cup of coffee. You may be eligible for a world of 
benefits — more than you probably thought possible — 
available only to those who have served in the military. 
But to get your hands on them, you need to know what 
they are and what you need to do to get them. The chap-
ters in Part I are here to help you get started. They give 
you the basics on the type of coverage available for you 
and your loved ones, how to qualify, how to work with the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and more. Read on!

Chapter 1
The Wonderful World 
of Veterans Benefits
In This Chapter
▶ Preparing to receive benefits
▶ Taking a joyride through the benefits playground
E
xactly what is a benefit? My handy-dandy pocket dictionary says it’s “a 
theatrical performance or other public entertainment to raise money 
for a charitable organization or cause.” Wait a minute, that’s not right. Sorry, 
wrong definition. It’s also defined as “something that is advantageous or 
good, or a payment or gift.”
Okay, I can live with that. That means a veterans benefit is something good, 
and this book is chock-full of good things available only to veterans (and 
sometimes their spouses and dependents too).
If you thought this book was going to be about how the government takes 
advantage of veterans, or how hard it is to get veterans benefits, or how the 
system is all messed up, I’m afraid you’re going to be disappointed. Plenty of 
that negative attitude is already available between the covers of other books 
and on the pages of magazines, newspapers, and Web sites. I’m not going to 
add to that. This book is all about what benefits are available and how you — 
the veteran or veteran’s family member — can get your hands on them.
In my extensive travels throughout the United States in recent years, I’ve 
spoken to hundreds of veterans. After the obligatory war stories about how 
we each individually saved the world a time or two, the topic often turned 
to veterans benefits. I was surprised to find out how many veterans have no 
clue about the benefits they’re entitled to in exchange for the services they 
gave and the sacrifices they made in defense of their country.

10
Part I: Benefiting From Benefits  
That’s my goal in writing this book. It’s not to lambaste the powers-that-be 
for not doing enough. I’m not going to criticize the Department of Veterans 
Affairs or the Department of Defense. I’m not going to tell you horror stories 
of veterans who have been tangled up in the system for years. If that’s what 
you’re looking for, you can pick up one of the other books out there in book 
land that address those topics.
I have a brand-new approach, one that’s never been tried before. In this 
book, I tell you in simple, plain language what veterans benefits are available 
to you and what you need to do to apply for them. Sounds fun, right? I knew 
you’d agree.
Getting Familiar with the 
Benefits You Deserve
I think you’re going to be surprised at the number and types of benefits that 
are available to you. Of course, nobody is going to walk up to your door and 
hand them to you. That would be too easy. Instead, you have to know what 
benefits there are, you must find out what the eligibility criteria is to receive 
a particular benefit, you need to know which government agency is in charge 
of that benefit, and then you have to ask for the benefit.
 
You would think, by now, that our government would agree on who is entitled 
to call themselves a veteran. You’d think so, but you’d be wrong. As you read 
Chapter 2, you discover that there’s no single legal definition for the term 
veteran when it comes to veterans benefits. Because different benefits were 
enacted into law at different times by different Congresses, each benefit has 
varying qualification criteria. You can qualify for some benefits with just one 
day of military service. Other benefits require you to serve a minimum amount 
of time. Still others require that you meet certain conditions, such as having a 
disability resulting from military service.
You’d also think that the government would have some kind of massive 
computer system that would have all the details about your service in the 
United States military. You would think Uncle Sam would know when you 
served, where you served, how long you served, what medals you may have 
earned, and what kind of discharge you received. Once again, you’d be wrong. 
Maybe in the future, but right now if you want a particular benefit, it’s up to 
you to prove your status as a veteran. You do this by providing copies of 
your military discharge paperwork. Chapter 2 tells you what paperwork you 
need and — if you don’t have it — how you can get it.

11
 Chapter 1: The Wonderful World of Veterans Benefits
You may be one of those who think that you need an honorable discharge 
to qualify for a veterans benefit. Many veterans believe that. If you’re in this 
camp and you don’t have an honorable discharge, you’ll be very glad you 
bought this book. The information in Chapter 2 dispels that myth. Some ben-
efits require an honorable discharge, but there are many benefits you can 
receive with a general or other than honorable discharge as well.
Breaking Down Your Benefits
You may be surprised to find out how many goodies are available to veter-
ans and their family members. Some of these benefits are well-known, such 
as medical care and disability compensation. You may have never heard 
of other benefits, ranging from loans to open a small business to free head-
stones when you finally move on to that big battlefield in the sky.
Other goodies include free or low-cost medical care, cash payments directly 
from Uncle Sam, plans designed to help you get a college degree or voca-
tional training, programs that assist you in finding and getting your dream 
job, programs that help you buy a house or find a place to live in your golden 
years, shopping and travel perks, memorial and burial benefits, and services 
and programs available to surviving family members.
In the beginning, there were veterans benefits
I was planning to title this sidebar “In the begin-
ning, there were no veteran benefits” because I 
thought it would be a catchy title. Turns out, how-
ever, that statement’s not true. We Americans 
began offering benefits to our soldiers even 
before our founding fathers got together and 
told the British to take a hike. In 1636, the folks in 
Plymouth Colony, when they weren’t busy wear-
ing funny hats and shooting at turkeys, declared 
that any soldier who received a disabling injury 
while defending the colony would be taken care 
of by the colony for life.
In 1780, during the Revolutionary War, the 
Continental Congress attempted to boost 
recruitment by promising officers half pay for 
seven years and enlisted soldiers a mustering-
out bonus of $80 if they served to the conclu-
sion of the war. The Congress also provided 
pensions for those disabled in the conflict. 
Other soldiers and sailors were promised land 
deeds in exchange for their military service. We 
Americans have a proud tradition of taking care 
of our veterans.

12
Part I: Benefiting From Benefits  
Meeting your healthcare needs
Most veterans are eligible for healthcare, either through the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) or through the Department of Defense (DOD). It may or 
may not be cost free, depending on your particular status and annual income. 
In today’s world of rising healthcare costs, this is a very valuable benefit.
The VA’s healthcare program is designed to meet the basic medical needs of 
all veterans, whether they have an injury or illness related to their service 
in the military or not. As with most modern healthcare programs, the VA’s 
system emphasizes preventive care, including examinations, vaccinations, 
primary care, emergency care, hospitalizations, surgeries, mental health 
care, counseling services, and more. Some veterans may even be eligible for 
free eyeglasses, hearing aids, and dental services.
Under the VA system, the government will even pay your travel expenses to 
receive healthcare in certain circumstances. When’s the last time you heard 
“No” doesn’t always mean no
You may ask for a benefit and be told no. You 
may be told that you’re not eligible for the ben-
efit because of this or that, even though you 
read this book from cover to cover and believe 
that you meet the eligibility criteria. Maybe you 
asked for a benefit years ago, only to be told 
you don’t qualify, so you gave up.
Maybe you were told no, and you don’t even 
know why. The Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) has developed a bad habit over the years 
of phrasing its rejection letters in such a way 
that even legal eagles couldn’t understand 
them. Fortunately, the agency isn’t allowed 
to do that anymore. A brand-new law (passed 
in September 2008 by your friendly neighbor-
hood Congress critters) now requires the VA 
to use plain, simple, everyday language when 
it rejects a benefit claim. Wow! What a great 
idea! I wonder why nobody ever thought of this 
before?
Even if the VA says no in simple, plain, every-
day language, it doesn’t mean that it’s right. 
Most of the time when the VA rejects a claim, 
it’s because you didn’t provide the correct 
paperwork — what the VA calls supporting 
evidence. Chapter 3 not only helps you avoid 
that mistakes by getting your ducks in a row 
before you apply in the first place, but it also 
tells you what you can do if the VA says no 
and you think it’s wrong (you’d be surprised to 
know how often the VA is wrong).
You can ask the VA to take another look at your 
case, and if it still says no (stubborn little rascal, 
isn’t it?), you can appeal the decision. There’s 
even a federal court that does nothing else but 
hears appeals for veterans benefit claims.

13
 Chapter 1: The Wonderful World of Veterans Benefits
of a healthcare program that paid you to go see the doctor? That’s pretty 
cool, if you ask me. You can read all about it in Chapter 4.
 
A special group of veterans, known as military retirees, has access to a sepa-
rate healthcare system managed by the DOD, called Tricare. Of course, most 
of these retirees are eligible for the VA system as well, but Tricare gives 
you more options when selecting medical providers, and — unlike the VA 
program — it’s available to immediate family members as well. The bad news 
is that it’s not available to all veterans, just those who served for 20 or more 
years in the military. Chapter 5 tells you everything you ever wanted to know 
about Tricare.
Pocketing a monthly check
Millions upon millions of military veterans qualify to receive a monthly check 
from the government. Well, it’s not really a check . . . these days everything is 
done by direct deposit. Oh, well, think of the trees we’re saving.
Veterans who can show that they have a disability or medical condition that 
was caused or made worse by their service in the military may qualify for a 
special monthly payment, called disability compensation. The VA rates such 
disabilities on a rating scale of 10 percent to 100 percent, in 10 percent incre-
ments, depending on how severe the condition is.
The amount of disability compensation depends on the severity of the rated 
disability and other factors, such as number of dependents who live with the 
veteran. The minimum monthly payment is currently $117 per month (vet-
eran with no dependents and a 10 percent service-connected disability), but 
some veterans may receive more than $7,000 per month. Does that sound 
interesting? If so, take a look at Chapter 6.
 
Even if you don’t have a service-connected disability, you may still qualify for 
monthly payments from the VA. Veterans with even one day of wartime ser-
vice who are 100 percent disabled or over the age of 65 and have a low income 
may be eligible for a VA pension. Chapter 6 has information on this program 
as well.
Anyone who’s ever stepped foot in a military recruiter’s office knows that if 
you serve for 20 or more years in the military, you receive monthly military 
retirement pay for life. But did you know that, in some cases, it’s possible 
to retire from the military before 20 years of service? Or did you know that 
ex-spouses may be entitled to a portion of your military retirement pay? You 
can read all about it in Chapter 7.

Part I: Benefiting From Benefits  
Sometimes old soldiers do die: Memorial 
benefits and taking care of survivors
With all due respect to General MacArthur, he was wrong. Dying is a part 
of life and a part that nobody can avoid. Veterans may die, but that doesn’t 
mean they’re forgotten or that benefits stop.
We not only owe our nation’s veterans a debt of gratitude, but their family 
members deserve our thanks as well. Chapter 8 includes programs available 
to surviving family members of military veterans. Various life insurance pro-
grams are available only to veterans, and survivors may also be eligible for 
medical care, pensions, and education benefits.
A host of burial and memorial benefits are available for most deceased vet-
erans, including free burial services, no-cost markers and headstones, reim-
bursement for funeral and burial expenses, free national and state veterans 
cemeteries, and military funeral honors performed by a precision military 
honor guard. You can read all about these benefits in Chapter 9.
Getting educated about education benefits
You’ve probably heard of the GI Bill. It’s been around in one form or another 
since World War II. But the GI Bill education program you know of may not 
bear any resemblance to the GI Bill today. My, oh my, has this program 
changed over the years. There’s even a brand-new GI Bill, created in 2008, 
called the GI Bill of the 21st Century. It’s applicable to most veterans who have 
active-duty service after September 11, 2001. If you served in the military 
after 9/11, you most certainly want to read all about this valuable education 
program in Chapter 10.
 
Even if you got out of the military before 9/11, there may be a GI Bill program 
applicable to your situation. However, you’ll want to hurry to check out the 
information in Chapter 10. The GI Bill isn’t forever — there’s a time limit on 
how long you have to use it.
If you’re not eligible for education benefits under the GI Bill, you may still be 
eligible to go to college or receive vocational training on the government’s 
dime if you have a service-connected disability that affects your ability to get 
and hold a job. Details about this program are in Chapter 11.

 Chapter 1: The Wonderful World of Veterans Benefits
Take this job and . . . well, 
just take this job
Want to know who’s the largest employer in the United States? I’ll give you a 
hint: It’s not Walmart (although it’s the largest private employer in the U.S.). 
The single largest employer in the United States is the federal government. 
The U.S. government has more than 1.8 million employees, and that doesn’t 
even count the 785,989 folks who work for the U.S. Postal Service. Walmart 
only has a measly 1.1 million employees.
Did you know that some veterans may qualify for special hiring preference 
for federal government jobs? It’s true. Most veterans are eligible for additional 
points when competing for federal jobs. If you served during certain periods, 
you can get even more hiring points.
You say that you don’t want a government job? Well, I can’t say that I blame 
you. The only government job I’m personally interested in is becoming the 
president, and that’s probably not going to happen (plus, veterans prefer-
ence points don’t apply for that particular job).
Perhaps you’d like to own your own business, instead? Ah, that would be the 
life. You could take expensive business trips and lord over the peons you 
hire to do your bidding. The Small Business Administration has a program 
that may help you fulfill your dreams. Veterans can receive preferential treat-
ment and reduced interest rates for small business loans guaranteed by the 
federal government.
Chapter 12 has more information about these two valuable benefits.
There’s no place like home
Everyone wants to own their own home one day. I know I do. I can’t live with 
my children for the rest of my life. I’m just kidding. I don’t live with my kids — 
there’s no way that they’d put up with me. Writers are no fun to live with. 
We’re often cranky; we’re lazy; and sometimes we forget to shower.
When I’m ready to buy my own home, I’m certainly going to take advantage 
of the VA Home Loan Program. Every eligible veteran should, in my opinion. 
Under this program, the government doesn’t actually lend you any money, 
but it guarantees the loan. In other words, if you default, the government 

16
Part I: Benefiting From Benefits  
pays off the loan (up to a certain amount). That makes you a very attractive 
candidate to certain mortgage lenders. It’s kind of like having Big Brother 
as a co-signer. If you’re eligible for this program, you may find it easier and 
cheaper to finance your next dream house. But you’ll certainly want to read 
Chapter 13 first.
When I reach my golden years, I may consider giving my dream home to 
my kids (if they continue to be nice to me and remember my birthday, and 
they stop asking me for an allowance) and move into a military retirement 
home. You say you’ve never heard of such a place? The federal government 
operates two retirement homes for certain veteran enlisted members; several 
private, nonprofit organizations offer retirement communities for officers. If 
the thought of golf and shuffleboard and trips and home-cooked meals when 
you’re old and gray tickles your fancy, check out Chapter 14.
Shopping and sight-seeing
My personal copy of Writing Dummies Books For Dummies says I should 
avoid sexism. I’m sorry, but I can’t help engaging in a little sexism here. Many 
women love to shop. The only thing they seem to love more than shopping is 
finding huge discounts when they shop. I know my own girlfriend is certainly 
hard-wired for shopping. Fortunately for her (and my wallet), tons of shop-
ping and discount opportunities are available to military retirees and certain 
other veterans.
Want to buy a diamond bracelet for 50 bucks or a new TV for $10? I’m sorry, 
but that’s not going to happen on a military base — this is a benefit, not a 
pipedream. However, you can save up to 30 or 40 percent by shopping on 
military bases or through the military exchange system’s Internet sites. 
Ready to snag a bargain? Take a look at the information in Chapter 15.
My girlfriend may love to shop, but I love to travel. I’d spend every waking 
moment traveling if I could. I love to see things I’ve never seen before and 
meet people I’ve never met before. It’s lucky for me that many veterans 
qualify for military travel benefits, including free aircraft flights, discount 
luxury condominium rentals in exotic locations, Armed Forces Recreation 
Centers, and cheap overnight stays in military hotels. Chapter 16 has the 411 
on these benefits.

W
hen I was a kid, I thought I knew what a military veteran was. They 
were all those old people hanging out at the American Legion or the 
local VFW, right? Then my dad told me that he was a veteran, having served 
during the Korean War. I was confused because my dad never hung out at 
these two clubs. Confusion being the natural state of my life at that age, I 
didn’t let it hinder me. I wrote an article about veterans for my high school 
newspaper during the week of Veterans Day. Not only did I learn a lot about 
military veterans, but that article got me a date with Lori Geller, who thought 
the article was “far out.”
The truth is, millions upon millions of veterans are living in the United States. 
Some veterans are very vocal about their status, active in veterans affairs, 
and belong to various veteran organizations, while others go quietly through 
their lives, never even mentioning their status as an American veteran of the 
armed forces.
You probably know several veterans, whether you know them to be veterans 
or not. Perhaps your neighbor, teacher, doctor, lawyer, dog catcher, or best 
friend is a veteran. As I said, I didn’t even know my own dad was a veteran 
until the year of that glorious date with Lori Geller.

18
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits  
Many veterans never take advantage of benefits available to them. My dad 
certainly didn’t. It’s possible that Dad didn’t even know about most of them. 
To my dad, veterans benefits were just for those who were “shot up during 
the war.” Not true, Father. Not true.
This chapter explains who can be called a veteran and how that status relates 
to benefits, and tells you what proof you need to show to get the benefits 
you’re entitled to.
What Is a Veteran? The Legal Definition
What exactly is a veteran? Are you a veteran if you spend one week in the mil-
itary and are then discharged because you’re injured in basic training? Are 
you a veteran if you spend four years in the National Guard or Reserves, but 
never spend any time on active duty? Are you a veteran if you spend 15 years 
on active duty, but are then given a dishonorable discharge?
My handy-dandy pocket dictionary defines the term veteran as “(1) a person 
who has served in the armed forces; (2) an old soldier who has seen long 
service.” That can’t be true. The first definition would mean that everyone 
who has ever seen a day of military service would qualify, even if they receive 
a dishonorable discharge. The latter would imply that only “old soldiers” 
could qualify as veterans.
Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations defines a veteran as “a person who 
served in the active military, naval, or air service and who was discharged or 
released under conditions other than dishonorable.”
That makes sense to me. In other words, a veteran is someone who, at one 
point in his or her life, wrote a blank check made payable to the United States 
of America for an amount “up to and including my life.”
This probably all seems very simple, right? Well, when it comes to benefits, 
the legal definition of veteran sometimes isn’t enough. You need to consider 
other things, such as the type of service involved, or even where you served. 
More on those issues in the following sections.

19
 Chapter 2: Determining Veteran Status and Qualifying for Benefits
Understanding the Difference between 
Types of Military Service
You’d be surprised how many people I meet who don’t know the difference 
between active-duty service, service in the Reserves, and National Guard 
service. If I had a dime for every time I’ve had to explain the differences, well, 
I’d have a lot of dimes. But because you’ve given up quite a few dimes for this 
book, I happily review the distinctions between these types of services in the 
following sections.
Full-time warriors
Active-duty service is full-time service. This is generally what most people 
think of when someone says he was in the military. Except when on leave 
(vacation) or pass (authorized time off), active-duty members are subject to 
duty 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Think of it as a full-time job.
These folks serve in the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast 
Guard. These military branches fall under the direction of the U.S. 
Department of Defense.
 
Active-duty service counts toward length-of-service requirements when quali-
fying for veterans benefits.
Weekend warriors
Members of the Reserves and National Guard normally perform duty one 
weekend per month, plus two weeks of training per year. It’s actually not fair 
to refer to them as weekend warriors anymore. Ever since the United States 
jumped onto the sand with both feet during the first Gulf War in 1990, these 
warriors have been spending more and more time called to full-time active 
duty in support of contingency operations.
The average National Guard or Reserve enlistment contract is for six years. 
These days, a Guard or Reserve member can expect to spend about two 
years of that six-year enlistment period performing full-time active duty.

20
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits  
Reserves
Each of the military services has a Reserve branch. There’s an Army Reserve, 
Air Force Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Coast Guard 
Reserve. Like the active-duty forces, the Reserves fall under the auspices of 
the Department of Defense, so they are federal agencies. The primary purpose 
of the Reserves is to provide additional support and manpower to the active-
duty forces in times of need.
When you join the Reserves, you first attend basic training and military job 
school full time. This is called active duty for training, or ADT, and doesn’t 
count as active-duty time for most veterans benefits.
Upon completion of basic training and military job school, reservists return 
to their home, resume their lives and normal civilian jobs, but train (drill) 
with their unit one weekend per month. Once per year, they receive 14 days 
of full-time training. The weekend drills are called inactive duty training (IDT), 
and the annual training falls into the category of ADT. Neither IDT nor ADT 
counts toward service requirements for veterans benefits.
The president and the secretary of defense can recall reservists to active 
duty at any time to support military missions. In fact, at any given time, about 
65,000 reservists are performing active duty in support of military contin-
gency operations. Active duty of this type does count toward veterans benefit 
service requirements.
National Guard
There are only two National Guard services: the Army National Guard and 
the Air National Guard. The Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard don’t have 
National Guard branches.
The main difference between the National Guard and the Reserves is that the 
Reserves belong to the federal government, while the National Guard units 
belong (primarily) to the individual states.
Like reservists, National Guard members attend basic training and military 
job school full time under ADT (active duty for training). They then return 
to their homes, where they drill with their units one weekend per month 
(inactive duty training [IDT]), plus 15 full-time training days per year. As with 
Reserve duty, this ADT/IDT time doesn’t count toward veterans benefit ser-
vice requirements.
State governors can call National Guard members to active duty in response 
to state emergencies, such as disaster relief or protection of property and 
people, when it’s beyond the scope of local law enforcement agencies. This 

21
 Chapter 2: Determining Veteran Status and Qualifying for Benefits
is officially known as a “Title 38 Call-up,” and is commonly referred to as state 
duty. State duty doesn’t count toward veterans benefit service requirements.
National Guard members can also be called to active duty by the president 
or secretary of defense in support of military contingency operations. This is 
called “Title 10 Call-up,” or federal duty. This type of duty does count toward 
service requirements for veterans benefits. During any given month, about 
40,000 members of the Air and Army National Guard are performing federal 
duty in such garden spots as Afghanistan and Iraq.
Active Guard/Reserves
Some members of the Reserves and National Guard perform full-time active 
duty, just like active-duty members. This program is called the Active Guard/
Reserves, or AGR. AGR members provide day-to-day operational support 
needed to ensure that National Guard and Reserve units are ready to mobi-
lize when needed. For veterans benefit service requirements, AGR duty is the 
same as full-time active-duty service (see the “Full-time warriors” section).
Individual Ready Reserve
It may surprise you to find out that everyone who joins the U.S. military for 
the first time incurs a minimum eight-year military service obligation. Yep. 
When you sign that enlistment contract, you’re obligating yourself to the mili-
tary for a total of eight years. Whatever time isn’t spent on active duty or in 
the Guard/Reserves must be spent in the inactive reserves, officially known 
as the Individual Ready Reserves (IRR).
Say you enlist in the Navy for four years. You serve your four years and get 
out. You’re really not “out.” You’re transferred to the IRR for the next four 
years. Members of the IRR don’t perform weekend drills or annual training, 
and they don’t get paid. However, IRR members can be recalled to active 
duty at any time in support of military operations. Time in the IRR doesn’t 
count toward veterans benefit service requirements, but if you’re recalled to 
active duty, that time does count.
An average of about 15,000 IRR members have been recalled to active duty 
each and every year since 2004, the vast majority by the Army and 
Marine Corps.

Digging Into the Details: Other 
Considerations for Benefits
Each time Congress passes a new veterans benefit law, the lawmakers estab-
lish specific eligibility criteria for that particular benefit. It can be confusing, 
to say the least. Luckily, you made the wise decision to buy this book.
For the purpose of benefits, being a veteran is not enough. Whether you 
qualify for benefits, or certain types of benefits, depends on several factors:
 
✓ Your length of service
 
✓ Where and when you served
 
✓ Your discharge characterization
More on these in the following sections. I cover the individual benefit issues 
in the other chapters.
Length of service
Eligibility for most veterans benefits requires a minimum length of mili-
tary service. Take a gander at Table 2-1. As you can see, to qualify for full 
Montgomery GI Bill education benefits, you have to serve for a minimum of 
36 months.
On the other hand, you could qualify for VA disability compensation or VA 
medical care with only one day of active duty. Don’t get too excited, because 
for disability or medical care, you have to meet a slew of other qualification 
requirements. Chapters 4 and 6 give you the complete lowdown on these two 
programs. (And if you’re wondering about the “Discharge Characterization” 
column, I cover that topic later in this chapter.)

Where and when you served
I don’t know why Congress can’t make things simple. Just to complicate 
things, where and when you served in the military can have an impact on 
your eligibility for certain veterans benefits.
Take another look at Table 2-1. To qualify for the VA Home Loan Program, 
you need at least 90 days of active-duty service if you served during the 
Vietnam War. However, if your military service was during the Gulf War, you 
must have at least 24 months of continuous active-duty service to qualify. A 
member of the National Guard or Reserves must have at least six years of 
Guard/Reserve service to qualify (unless they otherwise qualify due to active-
duty service).
Service discharges
I’m always amazed at how many people, including military people, think that 
there are only two types of military discharges (sometimes called character-
izations): honorable and dishonorable. I mean, really . . . didn’t anyone ever 
watch JAG on TV? I’ve lost track of the times that veterans, many with several 
years of military service, have said to me, “I want to apply for benefits, but I 
think I got a dishonorable discharge.”

26
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits  
Trust me. If you received a dishonorable discharge, you’d know it. This is 
the worst kind of military discharge possible, and it can only be imposed by 
a general court-martial (the most serious kind of military court-martial). It’s 
only given for serious crimes and is almost always accompanied by a lengthy 
stay in a military prison.
Military discharges come in two basic flavors:
 
✓ Administrative: Administrative discharges are granted by the discharge 
authority, who is usually a high-ranking commanding officer.
 
✓ Punitive: Punitive discharges can be imposed only by a military 
court-martial.
More on each in the next two sections.
Administrative discharges
The vast majority of those who serve in the military receive an administrative 
discharge, of which there are four types:
 
✓ Honorable discharge: Most people receive an honorable discharge 
(HD) following their service in the military. An HD means your command 
feels that you generally met the standards of conduct and performance 
of duty during your time in the military. It’s also granted if your service 
was otherwise so meritorious that any other characterization would be 
clearly inappropriate. For example, if you received a military medal for 
valor or bravery on the battlefield, you would usually be given an HD, 
even if you were a bit of a troublemaker otherwise.
 
✓ General (under honorable conditions) discharge: Usually simply 
referred to as a “general discharge,” or GD, this type of discharge is 
granted if your commander determines that your service has been 
honest and faithful, even if you got into a bit of trouble here and there. 
If you were discharged for reasons such as failure to progress in train-
ing; failure to maintain military standards, such as dress, appearance, 
weight, or fitness; or minor disciplinary infractions, you may have 
received this discharge characterization.
 
✓ Other than honorable discharge: This is the worst type of administrative 
discharge you can receive. Other than honorable (OTH) discharges 
are warranted when the reason for discharge is based upon a pattern 
of behavior that constitutes a significant departure from the conduct 
expected of members of the military services. Examples of factors 
that may be considered include an act of serious misconduct, abuse 
of authority, fraternization, or a pattern of continued misconduct. 
Individuals who receive court-martial convictions that don’t include 
punitive discharges are often given this discharge characterization.

27
 Chapter 2: Determining Veteran Status and Qualifying for Benefits
 
✓ Entry-level separation: This type of discharge isn’t actually a character-
ization. In fact, an entry-level separation (ELS) has no characterization at 
all. It’s not honorable, it’s not general, and it’s not other than honorable. 
Commanders may grant an ELS only for members who have been in 
the military for less than 180 days. It’s the commander’s way of saying, 
“Look, we tried you out, and you didn’t make it. However, I don’t know 
you well enough to fairly judge you.”
 
 If you were discharged with less than 180 days of service, don’t assume 
you received an ELS. Commanders may elect this option only if they feel 
it’s the most appropriate. If you punched out your drill instructor after 
only five days in basic training, it’s doubtful you received an ELS.
Punitive discharges
Only special and general courts-martial have the authority to impose a puni-
tive discharge. Summary courts can’t impose discharges. However, if you’re 
convicted of an offense by any court-martial, and the court doesn’t (or can’t) 
impose a punitive discharge, your commanding officer can elect to initiate 
administrative discharge proceedings as a separate matter (see the preced-
ing section for more on these).
There are three kinds of punitive discharges:
 
✓ Bad conduct discharge: A bad conduct discharge, or BCD, can be 
imposed by both special and general courts. However, it can only be 
given, as part of the court punishment, to enlisted members. Officers 
can’t receive a BCD. This discharge is usually given for convictions of 
such crimes as absent without leave, drunk on duty, driving while under 
the influence, adultery, bad checks, disorderly conduct, and so on.
 
✓ Dismissal: Dismissal from military service can only be imposed on 
officers. Special and general courts may impose this on officers when 
the maximum punishment listed in the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) 
includes a BCD (bad conduct discharge). Dismissal is the officer version 
of a BCD.
 
✓ Dishonorable discharge: A dishonorable discharge (DD) is the worst 
type of military discharge you can receive. It can be imposed only by 
a general courts-martial, and then only if the MCM (Manual for Courts-
Martial) authorizes a DD for the offense you’ve been convicted of. In most 
cases, a DD is accompanied by a very long vacation in a military prison.
How discharges affect eligibility
If you received an honorable or general discharge, you’re eligible for most 
veterans benefits, assuming you meet the other qualifying factors for that 

28
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits  
benefit. A few benefits, such as GI Bill education benefits (see Chapter 10), 
require an honorable discharge.
If you received a dishonorable discharge, a bad conduct discharge, or a dis-
missal from a general court-martial, you’re not entitled to veterans benefits.
If you received an OTH administrative discharge, or a BCD or dismissal 
imposed by a special court-martial, you may or may not be eligible for veter-
ans benefits. In these cases, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) makes 
a determination as to whether your service was “other than honorable.” 
In making this determination, the VA is required by law to apply the stan-
dards set forth by Congress in Title 38, Section 3.12, of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR).
 
You can view the CFR online at edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/
julqtr/pdf/38cfr3.12.pdf.
Generally, the VA evaluates your military service as “other than honorable” if
 
✓ You were discharged as a conscientious objector who refused to per-
form military duty, wear the uniform, or comply with lawful order of 
competent military authorities.
 
✓ You resigned as an officer for the “good of the service.”
 
✓ You accepted an OTH discharge rather than face a trial by general 
court-martial.
 
✓ You were discharged for desertion. The crime of desertion is defined 
as absent without leave (AWOL) with the intent to remain away 
permanently.
 
✓ You were discharged for AWOL in excess of 180 continuous days.
 
✓ You were discharged for the offense of mutiny or spying.
 
✓ You were discharged for an offense involving moral turpitude (or 
depravity). This includes, generally, conviction of a felony.
 
✓ You were discharged for willful and persistent misconduct.
 
✓ You were discharged for homosexual acts involving aggravating circum-
stances or other factors affecting the performance of duty. Examples 
include child molestation, homosexual prostitution, homosexual acts 
or conduct accompanied by assault or coercion, and homosexual acts 
or conduct taking place between service members of different ranks, or 
when a service member has taken advantage of his or her superior rank.
 
You can have your military discharge characterization upgraded, or even have 
your reason for discharge changed. For details, see Chapter 3.

29
 Chapter 2: Determining Veteran Status and Qualifying for Benefits
 
You may be eligible for VA medical care (see Chapter 4) even if the VA deter-
mines that your discharge doesn’t qualify for benefits. To qualify, the VA must 
find that you have a medical condition that was caused or aggravated by your 
military service.
Changing your discharge
If you have a disqualifying discharge characterization, does it mean you’re 
out of luck for receiving benefits? Not necessarily. If you believe your dis-
charge characterization or your reason for discharge to be inequitable or 
improper, you can apply to the appropriate Discharge Review Board (DRB) 
for a discharge upgrade or to change your reason for discharge.
 
✓ Inequitable means the reason for or characterization of the discharge isn’t 
consistent with the policies and traditions of the service. An example 
would be, “My discharge was inequitable because it was based on one 
minor, isolated incident in 28 months of service with no other problems.”
 
✓ Improper means that the reason for or characterization of the discharge is 
in error (that is, it’s false or violates a regulation or a law). An example is, 
“I was discharged because I failed the physical fitness test one time, and 
the regulation requires that I be given three chances before being 
discharged.”
There are separate DRBs, depending on which branch issued your military 
discharge. The Army, Air Force, and Coast Guard have separate boards. The 
Navy operates the board for Navy personnel and members of the U.S. Marine 
Corps. Members of the board are civilians, not military members. They are 
appointed to the board by the secretary of the corresponding service branch.
To apply for a discharge upgrade or a change of reason for discharge, you 
use DD Form 293, Application for Review of Discharge from the Armed Forces 
of the United States. You can download this form online at www.dtic.mil/
whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd0293.pdf. The form is 
also available at VA regional offices (see Appendix B) or by sending a written 
request to Army Review Boards Agency (ARBA), ATTN: Client Information 
and Quality Assurance, Arlington, VA 22202-4508.
You should complete the form by typing or clearly printing the requested 
information. Attach copies of statements or records that are relevant to your 
case. The board will upgrade your discharge only if you can prove that your 
discharge is inequitable or improper. You do this by providing evidence, such 
as signed statements from you and other witnesses or copies of records that 
support your case. (Chapter 3 has more information about submitting 
reliable documents and evidence.) It’s not enough to provide witnesses’ 

30
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits  
names because the board won’t contact them to obtain statements. You 
should contact your witnesses to get their signed statements, and then 
submit them with your request.
 
Requesting a review of your discharge isn’t a means of clemency or “time off 
for good behavior.” The board isn’t interested in your behavior after you left 
the military. Restrict your statements to the periods that were directly related 
to your military service.
Sign the completed form and mail it to the appropriate board address located 
on the back of the form.
If the board denies your request, there is no further appeal, except through 
the federal court system (you’d have to file a lawsuit against the Department 
of Defense). However, you can request that the board reconsider your case, 
but only if you provide newly discovered relevant evidence that wasn’t avail-
able when you filed your original application. Re-argument of the same evi-
dence won’t get your case reconsidered.
 
If your discharge is more than 15 years old, you can only change it by using 
the procedures for fixing errors in military records, as described in Chapter 3.
Service Records: Proving Your Eligibility
You can’t just walk into a VA office and say, “Here I am. Give me my benefits.” 
You first have to prove that you’re entitled to them. This is accomplished by 
presenting an official copy of your DD Form 214/215, or NGB 22/22A.
These forms are among the most important documents the military will ever 
give you. They are your key to participation in all VA programs as well as sev-
eral state and federal veterans benefits programs.
DD Forms 214 and 215
DD Forms 214 and 215 are used for certification of military service for active-
duty members and members of the Reserves. DD Form 214, Certificate of 
Release or Discharge, displays reserve and active-duty time, military job, 
awards, education, dates and places you entered and left the military, military 
assignments, and, at the bottom of the form, why you left the service and what 
your discharge characterization was. DD Form 215 is used to correct errors or 
make additions to a DD Form 214 after the original has been delivered.

31
 Chapter 2: Determining Veteran Status and Qualifying for Benefits
There are two versions of these forms:
 
✓ The deleted version: You can show this version to future civilian 
employers when you apply for a job. It excludes your discharge char-
acterization and the reason for your discharge (on the assumption you 
may not want your future employer to know this information).
 
✓ The undeleted version: The undeleted version must be used when 
applying for VA benefits. It includes your discharge characterization and 
the reason for your discharge.
You should receive a copy of both the deleted and undeleted versions of DD 
Form 214 when you process for separation from the military. However, the 
military being the military, this doesn’t always happen. If you didn’t receive 
a copy, or you lost it, you can request a replacement from the National 
Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri (see the next section).
Getting replacement copies
The National Personnel Records Center maintains copies of all active-duty 
and reserve military records. You can request a copy of any portion of your 
military records, including your DD Form 214/215, by submitting a signed 
copy of SF Form 180, Request Pertaining to Military Records. You can down-
load this form at www.archives.gov/research/order/standard-
form-180.pdf. Mail the completed form to
National Personnel Records Center
Military Personnel Records
9700 Page Ave.
St. Louis, MO 63132-5100
 
You can now complete a records request online at www.archives.gov/
veterans/evetrecs/index.html. You must still print and sign a signature 
verification form (and mail or fax it), because federal law requires a signature 
on all records request. However, completing the application online can be 
easier and faster than completing SF Form 180.
How long does it take?
Not all that long ago, turnaround time for military records was miserable. It 
wasn’t unusual for a simple DD Form 214/215 request to take up to 180 days.
However, in the past couple of years, the National Personnel Records Center 
has received some extra money from Congress to upgrade its computers. As 
a test, I requested a copy of my DD Form 214 in June 2008, using the online 
system. I was pleasantly surprised to receive my DD Form 214 copy in just 
seven days.

32
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits  
However, the folks at the center are still busy bees. They process nearly 
20,000 requests per week. Turnaround times for records requested from the 
National Personnel Records Center can vary greatly depending on the nature 
of the request, so please have a little patience.
NGB Forms 22 and 22A
What DD Forms 214 and 215 are for active-duty and reserve service, NGB 
Forms 22 and 22A are for service in the Army and Air National Guard. Like 
its active-duty/reserve counterpart, NGB Form 22, Report of Separation and 
Military Service, includes information about your National Guard service 
time, military job, decorations, reason for discharge, and discharge char-
acterization. NGB Form 22A is used to document changes to your military 
records after the fact.
 
Because the National Guard belongs to the individual state, not to the federal 
government, there’s not a central repository for National Guard records.
To obtain a copy of your NGB Form 22/22A, you have to contact the National 
Guard Adjutant General’s Office for the particular state in which you per-
formed National Guard service. For contact information, visit www.ngb.
army.mil/resources/states.aspx.
Military medical records
Anyone who has ever spent even one day in the military has a military medi-
cal record. The first entry in your medical record is the details of the physi-
cal examination you underwent as part of the process of joining the military. 
After that, every single time you received medical care from a military medi-
cal facility, the details were entered into your military medical record.
The VA relies heavily on military medical records when making determina-
tions as to whether you have a medical condition that was caused or aggra-
vated by military service.
You can request a copy of your military medical record by sending a written 
request to
National Personnel Records Center
Military Personnel Records
9700 Page Ave.
St. Louis, MO 63132-5100

33
 Chapter 2: Determining Veteran Status and Qualifying for Benefits
 
If you plan to file a claim for medical benefits (see Chapter 4) or disability 
compensation (see Chapter 6) with the VA, you don’t need to request a copy 
of your military medical record. When you file a claim, the VA will request the 
record automatically as part of the claims process. Likewise, if you’ve ever 
filed a claim for disability benefits from the VA, it already has a copy of your 
medical records. You can request a copy from the VA regional office having 
jurisdiction over your claim. See Appendix B for VA regional office locations.
Protecting Your Paperwork
You should take steps to protect your DD Form 214/215 or NGB Form 22/22A 
as you would any other sensitive document (wills, marriage and birth certifi-
cates, insurance policies, and so on). You may want to store it in a fireproof 
lock box at your home, a safe-deposit box at your bank, or at some other 
secure location where it will be protected.
 
In most states, you can register or record your separation documents just like 
a land deed or other significant document. So as soon as you separate from 
the military, consider registering these documents with your county recorder 
or town hall. If you register your documents, you can quickly retrieve them 
later for a nominal fee.
 
To ensure documents will be safeguarded from viewing by unauthorized 
individuals, ask the registering agency whether state or local law permits the 
public to access the recorded document. If public access is authorized and 
you register your separation documents, a member of the public could obtain 
a copy for an unlawful purpose (for example, to obtain a credit card in your 
name). If public access is permitted, you may choose not to register your 
separation document.

Navigating Your Way through the 
Red Tape of Claims and Appeals
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a close look at the VA and military service departments
▶ Staking your claim to benefits
▶ Preparing your paperwork
▶ Navigating the appeals maze
▶ Taking your case to court
I
f I’ve heard it once, I’ve heard it a hundred times: “You can’t fight city 
hall.” It’s a good thing that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and 
the Department of Defense (DOD) military service offices aren’t city hall. You 
actually can fight them. Well, you can consider several avenues of appeals if 
your claim for veterans benefits is denied.
Actually, you may be pleasantly surprised when working with the VA and 
DOD. The old days of “baffle them with bureaucracy” is fast fading away. The 
new days of “let’s see if we can help you with this” seems to be taking hold. 
Perhaps this reflects the fact that the American people seem to have become 
proud and supportive of our veterans again.
However, it’s still not all a bed of roses. The VA is seriously overworked, and this 
can be frustrating when you’re trying to make a benefits claim. As of September 
2008, the VA had a backlog of 512,700-plus claims pending and 90,800-plus 
appeals pending. The average new-claim processing time for disability com-
pensation and pensions is a little over six months, while appeals may take 
several years. This backlog is frustrating and unacceptable to everyone con-
cerned, especially veterans and their families. The reasons for this backlog 
are numerous, complex, and in all fairness to the VA, beyond its immediate 
control.

36
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits 
Only Congress can fix this. The VA needs loads of additional funds to hire 
and train more claims processors and to bulk up its appeal divisions. So get 
out your No. 2 pencils and crayons, boys and girls, and let your representa-
tives know that you want the VA to receive more funding (Congress has this 
annoying habit of adding new veterans benefits, but then not providing any 
money to the VA to provide those benefits). In the meantime, in this chapter I 
give you some pointers on how to navigate your way through the morass and 
get what you need.
Meeting the Two Main Benefits Agencies
Two government agencies have pretty much cornered the market when it 
comes to veterans benefits. Virtually all benefits are managed by either the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or the Department of Defense (DOD).
Okay, there are two exceptions: the veterans’ preference program for gov-
ernment jobs is managed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 
and the veterans small business loan program belongs to the Small Business 
Administration. Chapter 12 has complete information about those two programs. 
For now, here’s an introduction to the VA and DOD, starting with the VA.
The Department of Veterans Affairs
The VA has been around in one form or another since it was created as the 
Veterans Administration by President Herbert Hoover on July 21, 1930. Today 
the VA is huge. It has an annual budget of about $86 billion and employs 
about 230,000 people. It operates 1,357 facilities, including regional offices, 
vet centers, medical centers, and outpatient clinics, throughout the United 
States and its territories.
The VA has staked its claim for most veterans benefits. This includes, but is 
not limited to
 
✓ VA healthcare, as explained in Chapter 4
 
✓ Disability compensation, as explained in Chapter 6
 
✓ The GI Bill education program, detailed in Chapter 10
 
✓ VA pensions, as explained in Chapter 6
 
✓ Veteran survivor benefits, as outlined in Chapter 8
About 5.3 million veterans are enrolled in the VA’s healthcare program, and 
more than 3.7 million veterans receive disability compensation and pensions 
through the agency. The VA processes an average of 805,000 new claims 

37
 Chapter 3: Navigating Your Way through the Red Tape of Claims and Appeals
for disability compensation or pensions each year (and the number keeps 
rising). Millions of other veterans are served through the VA’s other benefit 
programs.
With the exception of medical care, when you apply for a VA benefit, you usu-
ally work with the VA regional office closest to where you live. Counselors 
are also available at VA veterans centers, scattered throughout most cities. 
These counselors can assist you in filling out paperwork and getting your 
documents in order. Appendix B shows a complete list of VA regional offices 
and vet centers.
For VA medical care, you generally apply through a VA medical center. 
Appendix C shows where you can find your closest VA medical center.
The Department of Defense 
and military services
If you’re retired from the military (that is, you have more than 20 years of mil-
itary service, as explained in Chapter 7), you receive many of your benefits 
through the Department of Defense (DOD) or your individual military service 
branch. The DOD covers all five military branches:
 
✓ Army
 
✓ Air Force
 
✓ Navy
 
✓ Marine Corps
 
✓ Coast Guard
Each of these branches has an active-duty component (full-time service) 
and a reserve component (part-time service). The Army and the Air Force 
also have a National Guard, which is organized under the parent branch and 
under the individual state.
What the DOD covers
Benefits covered by the DOD include
 
✓ Military retirement pay, as explained in Chapter 7
 
✓ Shopping and travel benefits, as explained in Chapters 14 and 15
 
✓ Military healthcare (Tricare), as explained in Chapter 5
 
✓ Combat-related special compensation, as explained in Chapter 6

38
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits 
 
The key to many military retiree benefits is the military retired identification 
card (see Chapter 15). Retirees and their family members receive this card at 
the Pass & ID section of any military base. You don’t need to go to your parent 
service base to do this. In other words, if you retired from the Air Force and 
you happen to live close to an Army base, you can go to the Army base to 
renew or replace your military ID card.
Getting help from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service
Retiree pay matters can’t be resolved by visiting a military base. Retirees 
have to contact the appropriate branch of the Defense Finance and 
Accounting Service (DFAS). Its Web site is www.dfas.mil. You also can ask 
questions, get answers, and resolve problems with your military retired pay 
by contacting DFAS at 800-321-1080.
 
DFAS also has a nifty online system, called myPay, that retirees can use to 
access their pay information and make changes to their retiree pay account. 
The system is available on the DFAS Web site at www.dfas.mil.
Double-Checking Your Documentation 
and Eligibility
One reason the veterans benefit claims system is so backlogged is that many 
veterans apply for benefits that they aren’t eligible for. The VA has to take 
extra time to make sure the person is ineligible for the benefit and then write 
a rejection letter.
Each and every VA benefit has different eligibility rules. Why? Each and every 
veterans benefit represents a different law, passed by Congress, at a differ-
ent time. Eligibility for a particular benefit depends on what the lawmakers’ 
whims were when they wrote the specific law to authorize that benefit.
For example, to qualify for the Montgomery GI Bill education program 
(Chapter 10), you need an honorable discharge. If you have a general 
(under honorable conditions) discharge, you’re not eligible. However, 
for many other veterans benefits, a general discharge is qualifying. See 
Chapter 2 for more information about discharge characterizations and 
how they affect VA benefits.
It’s a good thing you’ve shown the forethought, intelligence, and good ol’ 
common sense to buy this book. You’re well on your way to understanding 
the rules for each benefit.

39
 Chapter 3: Navigating Your Way through the Red Tape of Claims and Appeals
Collecting your documents
Another factor that affects the VA’s backlog of veterans benefit claims is 
insufficient documentation or incorrect documentation. For most claims, you 
must prove two things:
 
✓ That you meet the qualifications of military service and discharge 
characterization for that benefit. You prove your status as a veteran 
by providing a copy of your military discharge form, such as your DD 
Form 214. The form includes information about when you served in the 
military, where you served, medals and awards you earned, and your 
discharge characterization. If you don’t have a copy of this form, you can 
get a replacement. Chapter 2 explains how to request a copy of your 
discharge form.
 
 For almost any benefit, you’ll need to provide a copy of DD Form 214, or 
its equivalent, to prove you meet the active-duty service and discharge 
requirements to be eligible for the benefit.
 
✓ That you meet any other criteria required for that benefit (for example, 
a service-connected disability). This is where many veterans run into 
trouble. There’s no all-inclusive list of necessary supporting documen-
tation because it differs for each situation, but common sense plays a 
large part. Remember that, for the most part, the burden of proof to 
show eligibility for a particular benefit lies with you.
Supplying examples of proof
There is no all-inclusive list of possible documents you can use to support 
your benefit claim. It depends on your particular situation and the benefit 
you’re applying for.
Citations from military medals and decorations may help. For example, if you 
submit a citation for the award of the Purple Heart, which is a decoration 
awarded only to those who are wounded in combat, that makes a pretty clear 
case that you received an injury in the line of duty.
Sworn witness statements may also help your case, but be careful with those. 
If they’re not worded correctly and are vague, they may actually hurt your 
case (see the next section).
It’s quality, not quantity, that counts
It’s not the amount of supporting documentation that’s important, but whether 
that documentation supports your claim. The best supporting evidence is

40
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits 
 
✓ Specific: Your documentation and witness statements should relate 
directly to the benefit you’re claiming and contain as much specific 
information as possible. Exact dates and times are more persuasive than 
“sometime around March of 1976.” A doctor’s report that says, “The 
patient is suffering from a wound that was caused by shrapnel injury, 
consistent with wounds often received in combat zones,” is a whole lot 
better than, “The patient hurt his knee.”
 
✓ Verifiable: Anyone can write something on a piece of paper and sign 
it. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s true. The evidence you provide 
should be verifiable. That means you should be able to support it from 
other sources. If you claim you were injured during a combat operation 
in Afghanistan, you should be able to provide evidence that you were 
actually deployed to Afghanistan (deployment orders, unit rosters, and 
so forth).
 
✓ Authoritative: Witness statements signed by your mom, best friend, or 
postal carrier aren’t going to help you much. A witness statement signed 
by your commanding officer or platoon leader is going to carry more 
weight than a witness statement signed by your best combat buddy. 
Statements signed by medical corpsmen or doctors about treatment 
received in the combat zone are similarly effective.
For example, if you submit a sworn statement from your former command-
ing officer that says, “On July 17, 2003, my unit was undergoing simulated 
combat training at Dicklehead Army Post. I personally witnessed a tank run 
over Private Hurtsalot’s foot. I immediately summoned medical care, and he 
was transported to the medical facility with a crushed foot,” that would be 
acceptable documentation.
On the other hand, if you submit 20 sworn witness statements, which all state 
something along the lines of, “We were practicing war games a few years ago, 
and tanks were running around everywhere. I didn’t actually see his foot get 
run over, but I remember hearing him scream, and the next day I noticed a 
bandage on his foot,” that probably wouldn’t be very helpful to your case.
Using the VA’s “duty to assist”
Under the law, the burden of proof for benefit eligibility falls directly on your 
shoulders. However, you don’t have to do it all alone. In the year 2000, the 
thoughtful folks who roam the halls of Capitol Hill got together and passed a 
new law, obligating the VA to assist you in gathering supporting documenta-
tion. This is referred to as the VA’s duty to assist.
First and foremost, the law requires the VA to tell you, in simple words, 
exactly what evidence is required to support your claim. That’s a big help 
in itself. You don’t have to guess what evidence you should and shouldn’t 
submit. The VA will tell you exactly what you need.

41
 Chapter 3: Navigating Your Way through the Red Tape of Claims and Appeals
The law also requires the VA to make a “reasonable effort” to obtain the evi-
dence for you. The standard by which the VA must apply this is slightly dif-
ferent depending on the sources of the records.
 
✓ Federal records: The VA must make a continued reasonable effort to 
try to obtain those records. The VA can stop pursuing the records only 
after it is reasonably sure the records don’t exist or that a continued 
effort to get the records would be futile. If the VA comes to this determi-
nation, the law requires the agency to notify you and inform you of pos-
sible alternatives.
 
✓ Nonfederal records: The VA must make a reasonable effort to get records 
such as private doctor records or sworn witness statements. The law 
requires the VA to send a request for such documents, and if it doesn’t 
receive them within two months, it must make another request. If there is 
still no response, the VA must continue to request the records, unless it 
has reason to believe that the records are unobtainable.
 
 For nonfederal records, you should make every attempt to obtain them 
yourself, especially medical records. It’s not uncommon for medical 
facilities to ignore such requests unless they come from the patient. 
Additionally, some of these facilities charge a fee to copy the records, 
and the VA isn’t allowed to pay such fees.
Submitting Your VA Claim
It would be nice if the VA had just one claim form that said, “Gimme all the 
benefits I’m entitled to.” Unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way. For each 
and every veterans benefit, there is a different claim form requiring different 
information. And most forms are submitted to different locations.
Luckily, I’ve hooked you up. As I explain each benefit in this book, I include 
information about what form you should fill out, where you can get the form, 
the minimum supporting documentation required, and where you submit the 
completed claim.
 
Most VA claims are delayed or denied because of lack of supporting evidence. 
I can’t emphasize this point enough. Before you officially submit your claim 
for a benefit, you should be 100 percent positive that you’ve included all the 
paperwork you need.
You need to be very careful when submitting a claim. The VA makes its deci-
sion based on your claim’s individual merits. If you submit an application and 
the VA denies it based on the merits of the evidence, it may be very difficult 
to reopen the claim in the future. You may have to submit new and material 
evidence, which can be difficult. Additionally, even if your claim isn’t denied 

42
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits 
right off the bat, your claim may be delayed for months if the VA has to stop 
processing it to request additional records.
Take full, and I mean full, advantage of the VA’s duty to assist before you 
submit your claim. Take another look at the “Using the VA’s ‘duty to assist’” 
section earlier in this chapter. This advice alone is worth the price of the book.
You can visit any VA regional office or VA veterans center (see Appendixes B 
and D), and counselors there are required by law to do everything possible 
to help you get your supporting evidence in shape. Make sure you take them 
up on this offer. It’s the most important thing you can do to speed up your 
claim and give it the best possible chance of approval.
 
When taking advantage of the VA’s duty to assist, always try to work with 
the same office and the same counselor so your representative knows what’s 
being submitted. Being inconsistent can cause problems with your claim.
Playing the Waiting Game: 
The Big Decision
After you submit your claim, get ready to wait. In many cases, get ready to 
wait a long, long time. Exactly how long depends on which benefit you’re 
applying for.
For example, the VA averages about 23 days to make decisions on claims con-
cerning Montgomery GI Bill benefits (see Chapter 10). Claims for VA medical 
benefits (enrolling in the VA healthcare program, as detailed in Chapter 4) 
are generally processed within 30 days. On the other hand, claims for disabil-
ity compensation and pensions, which are often the most difficult claims to 
decide, average 183 days.
The good news is that the VA has a goal to process all claims within 73 days. 
The bad news is that that goal was established in 2001, and the VA’s not even 
close yet.
So be prepared to wait. Decisions for most claims aren’t made at the main 
headquarters in Washington, D.C. Instead, decisions are made at the VA 
regional office that serves the area where you live.
An advantage of this setup is that claims can be processed faster, but the 
system has undergone substantial criticism because it often results in dis-
parities from one state to another. A veteran in California may have a claim 
approved, while a veteran with the exact same condition and supporting 
documentation in Wyoming may have his claim denied. However, that’s what 

43
 Chapter 3: Navigating Your Way through the Red Tape of Claims and Appeals
the appeals process is for, because appeals decisions are made by HQ in 
Washington (see the later “Deciding to Appeal” section).
Ultimately, the VA regional office sends you a decision, either approving your 
claim or denying it. You can either accept the decision or appeal it.
Fixing Errors in Your Military Record
What if an error in your military record, such as on your DD Form 214, makes 
you ineligible for a certain benefit? Perhaps DD Form 214 doesn’t include all 
of your active-duty service or maybe it’s missing a critical medal, such as the 
Purple Heart.
When you’re getting ready to leave the military, one of the final out-processing 
actions you accomplish is to sit down with a military personnel clerk and go 
over your DD Form 214 in detail. You’re supposed to make sure everything is 
correct before you sign it. However, we all know how that goes. You’ve got a 
thousand things on your mind, and you’re in the middle of going to about 2 
million out-processing appointments. It’s easy to miss something, especially 
if you’re not thinking about possible veterans benefits in the future.
Each service has its own Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR) 
that handles the correction of records. The Navy establishes the board for 
sailors and Marines. Board members are high-ranking civilian employees of 
the service and are assigned to the board by the secretary of the service. 
Board members are assigned to three-person panels that decide the cases.
Knowing the grounds for 
requesting a change
To apply for a change of your military record, you must convince the board 
that the information in your record is in error or that it has resulted in an 
injustice.
 
✓ In error is pretty obvious. It simply means the information in your record 
isn’t correct. For example, you performed 26 months of active duty, but 
your record shows you performed only 20 months.
 
✓ An example of an injustice would be if there were a letter of reprimand or 
a negative performance report in your record that was written by a
military supervisor who clearly was out to get you.

44
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits 
 
You should submit your request within three years of discovering, or reason-
ably could have discovered, the error or injustice. The boards review the 
merits of untimely applications. If the board finds your case to be meritorious, 
it can waive the timeliness in the interest of justice. You shouldn’t assume, 
however, that a waiver will be granted.
Submitting the proper paperwork
You submit your request by using DD Form 149, Application for Correction of 
Military Record. This form is available from VA regional offices (see Appendix 
B) and online at www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/
eforms/dd0149.pdf. Mail the completed application to the appropriate 
board address listed on the second page of the form.
You should be very careful when you complete this form. Attach copies of 
statements or records that are relevant to your case. For example, if your DD 
Form 214 includes an error concerning your active-duty service time, you’d 
want to submit copies of your military orders placing you on active duty.
Your own statement is important. Begin with item 9 of DD Form 149 and 
continue to item 17, if necessary. You may also put your statement on plain 
paper and attach it to the form. Limit your statement to no more than 25 
pages. Explain what happened and why it is an error or injustice in simple, 
direct terms.
Providing evidence is important!
Normally, the best evidence is statements from people who have direct 
knowledge of or involvement with the situation. For example, you can submit 
statements from people in your rating chain if you’re contesting a perfor-
mance report. Another example would be a statement from the person who 
counseled you if you are alleging improper counseling.
 
The board will correct your military record only if you can prove that you’re 
the victim of error or injustice. This decision is made solely on the evidence 
you provide. You can’t simply include witnesses’ names. The board won’t con-
tact them. You need to obtain and provide the statements yourself.
Understanding the advisory opinion
After your application is received, one or more offices within your military 
service (Judge Advocate General’s office, military hospital, personnel center, 
and so on) will prepare an advisory opinion on your case. The advisory 

45
 Chapter 3: Navigating Your Way through the Red Tape of Claims and Appeals
opinion is sent to the board with your case file. If the advisory opinion rec-
ommends denial of your request, the board will send it to you for comment.
 
The advisory opinion is only a recommendation. The board actually makes the 
decision in your case.
You have 30 days to submit your comments on the advisory opinion. You 
may request an additional 30 days if you need it. The board usually grants 
reasonable requests for additional time.
 
It may be unnecessary for you to comment on the advisory opinion. If you 
have nothing further to say, don’t bother to respond. Failure to comment on 
an advisory opinion doesn’t mean you agree, nor does it prevent a full and fair 
consideration of your application.
If the board denies your request, there is no appeal, except if you decide 
to sue the Department of Defense in federal court. However, if you provide 
newly discovered relevant evidence that you didn’t know about when you 
filed your original application, the board may agree to reconsider your case.
Do You Need a Lawyer 
or Additional Help?
If you can afford a lawyer, you may as well hire one to help you. A knowledge-
able attorney can be very beneficial to your case, especially if your claim 
is denied and you have to enter the appeals process (see the “Deciding to 
Appeal” section). Many attorneys out there in lawyer land specialize in VA 
claims and in submitting requests for discharge upgrades or changes in mili-
tary records. However, they don’t work for free (well, I don’t know of any who 
do), and I don’t know very many rich veterans.
If you decide to go the lawyer route, check with your state’s bar association 
and ask for a list of local attorneys who specialize in veterans legal issues. 
You can usually find your state bar in the white pages of the phone book. Or 
go to www.romingerlegal.com/natbar.htm on the Web for a listing of all 
state bar associations.
If you want some help but not as much as an attorney would provide, or you 
don’t want to pay for advice, you can turn to a veterans service organization 
(VSO). Many VSOs, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), American 
Legion, and Disabled Veterans of America (DVA), have veterans representa-
tives who are experienced in the confusing world of veterans benefit claims. 
These representatives can represent you for free. So what’s the downside? 
VSOs receive thousands of requests for representation each year. They’re 
swamped. That means their representation is often limited to looking over 

46
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits 
your package and giving you advice. Usually, you’ve still got to do all the run-
ning around and getting your paperwork together yourself.
I include a list of VSOs that can provide representation service, as well as 
their contact information, in Chapter 17.
Many state veterans offices also have representatives who can assist veter-
ans from that state with VA claims and appeals. A list of state veterans offices 
can be found in Appendix A.
 
If you decide to go with a VSO or state veterans office, make sure your repre-
sentative is accredited with the VA General Counsel’s Office. These represen-
tatives have received special training and have been certified by the VA that 
they know what they’re doing. Such representatives carry a photo identifica-
tion card issued by the VA regional office, as well as a card signed by the VA 
general counsel, attesting to their accreditation.
Additionally, counselors at VA regional offices and vet centers (see 
Appendixes B and D) can be a big help in putting your claim together. See the 
“Using the VA’s ‘duty to assist’” section earlier in this chapter.
Deciding to Appeal
An appeal is a request for the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA) to review 
the VA regional office’s decision made on your claim. The BVA is part of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs and is located in Washington, D.C. You may 
appeal any decision that you aren’t satisfied with.
The vast majority of appeals (more than 90 percent) are made by veterans 
who are dissatisfied with their VA regional office’s decision concerning eli-
gibility for disability compensation, disability ratings, or pension. The two 
most common reasons for appeal are
 
✓ The VA denied you benefits for a disability that you believe is service 
connected (see Chapter 6 for more information about service-connected 
disabilities).
 
✓ You believe that your disability is more severe than the VA rated it 
(Chapter 6 has information about the VA disability rating system).
However, you can appeal for any reason.
 
Well, not quite any reason. Under the law, decisions concerning the need for 
medical care or the type of medical treatment needed, such as a physician’s 
decision to prescribe (or not to prescribe) a particular drug or whether 
to order a specific type of treatment, can’t be appealed through the VA 
appeals process. You need to address such matters to the director of the 

47
 Chapter 3: Navigating Your Way through the Red Tape of Claims and Appeals
VA medical center concerned. However, decisions concerning eligibility to 
enroll in the VA healthcare program (see Chapter 4) can be appealed.
Getting the appeals process rolling
You start the appeals process by submitting a Notice of Disagreement, often 
called an NOD, to the VA regional office that denied your claim. There’s no 
specific form used for an NOD. It’s simply a written statement from you to the 
VA regional office stating in simple, clear terms why you disagree with the 
decision.
 
The NOD must be submitted within one year of the date the VA regional office 
mailed you its original decision denying your claim.
Receiving a thumbs up or thumbs down
After the VA regional office receives your NOD, it will take another look at 
your case. It’s possible that it will agree with your argument in the NOD and 
approve your claim. If the folks at the regional office disagree, they’ll prepare 
a Statement of the Case (SOC).
The SOC is the VA regional office’s way of telling you that the board isn’t 
reversing the original decision and why. The SOC will summarize the evi-
dence and applicable laws and regulations, and include a detailed discussion 
of the reasons for the decision.
The SOC will also explain that to continue with your appeal, you must 
submit a VA Form 9, Appeal to Board of Veterans’ Appeals. This form will be 
included in the mailing from the regional office with the SOC.
Preparing to send your 
appeal up the chain
Up to this point, all decisions have been made by the VA regional office that 
serves your area. If you still disagree with them, it’s time to jack it up a notch 
and take your case to Washington, D.C., or more specifically, the Board of 
Veterans Appeals (BVA).
 
At this point in the process, about 90 percent of all veterans decide to seek 
representation to help them through the appeals process and represent their 
case (see the “Do You Need a Lawyer or Additional Help?” section). About 85 
percent of all veterans select a representative from a veterans service orga-
nization (VSO) or state veterans office, probably because they work for free. 

48
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits 
If you want someone to represent you on your appeal, you need to submit 
VA Form 21–22, Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant’s 
Representative, to authorize a VSO to represent you, or VA Form 21-22a, 
Appointment of Individual as Claimant’s Representative, to authorize an attor-
ney to represent you. Your VA regional office can provide these forms, or you 
can download them from www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA_21-22-
ARE.pdf and www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/21-22a.pdf, respectively.
You begin your appeal to the BVA by completing VA Form 9, Appeal to Board 
of Veterans’ Appeals. You should have received a copy of this form with 
the Statement of the Case (SOC; see the “Receiving a thumbs up or thumbs 
down” section). You can also get a copy of this form at your nearest VA 
regional center (see Appendix B) or online at www.va.gov/vaforms/va/
pdf/VA9.pdf.
When you fill out VA Form 9, you should state the benefit you want, any 
mistakes you find in the SOC, and whether you want a personal hearing. You 
send the completed Form 9 to the VA regional office that denied your claim.
 
You must submit VA Form 9 within 60 days of when the VA regional office 
mailed the SOC or within one year of when the regional office notified you of 
the original denial of your claim, whichever date is later. If you fail to meet 
these deadlines, you may lose your right to appeal.
If you submit new information or evidence with your VA Form 9, the VA 
regional office will again reconsider your case. It’s possible that the new 
evidence or information will cause it to reverse its decision and grant your 
claim. If not, it will prepare a Supplemental Statement of the Case, or SSOC. An 
SSOC is similar to the Statement of the Case, but it addresses the new infor-
mation or evidence you submitted. If you aren’t satisfied with the SSOC, you 
have 60 days from the date when the SSOC is mailed to you to submit, in writ-
ing, what you disagree with.
 
At any time during this process, you (or your representative, if you have one) 
can request a local office hearing. As its name implies, a local office hearing 
is a meeting held at the VA regional office between you and a hearing officer 
from the local office’s staff. To arrange a local office hearing, contact your 
local VA regional office or your appeal representative as early in the appeals 
process as possible.
 
A face-to-face meeting probably won’t add weight to your claim, nor will it 
speed up the claims process, but it gives you the opportunity to ask ques-
tions. It’s often helpful in determining the strength of your claim and whether 
you need additional supporting documentation.

49
 Chapter 3: Navigating Your Way through the Red Tape of Claims and Appeals
Getting on with the appeal
After you (or your representative) get finished passing SOCs, SSOCs, and 
responses back and forth, everything (your VA Form 9, all the evidence, 
SOCs, SSOCs, your responses, and a check for $10,000 — no, I’m kidding 
about that last item!) is gathered together by the VA regional office and 
placed into your claims folder. All of this paperwork is the basis for your
official appeal to the BVA.
When the VA regional office sends your appeal to Washington, it sends you 
a letter letting you know that you have 90 days from the date of the letter 
during which you can add more evidence to your file, request a hearing with 
the VBA, or select (or change) your representative. This is known as the 
90-Day Rule.
 
Each time you submit new information or evidence, the VA regional office will 
take a fresh look at your case. If it still disagrees, it’ll write an SSOC, to which 
you have 60 days to respond. All of this delays the time your appeal is sent 
to the BVA. This is why it’s very important to submit all relevant information 
when you first make your claim. See the “Submitting Your VA Claim” section.
When your appeal finally reaches the Washington center, it’s placed on the 
BVA’s docket. The docket is the record of all appeals awaiting the BVA’s 
review, listed in the order of receipt. When your appeal is placed on the 
docket, it’s assigned the next higher docket number than the one received 
before it. This is important because the BVA reviews appeals in the order 
in which they were placed on the docket. The lower the docket number, 
the sooner the appeal will be reviewed. It’s kind of like when you visit the 
Department of Motor Vehicles and the sign says to take a number.
Your claims folder actually remains at the VA regional office until three to 
four months before your docket number is expected to come up, after which 
it is transferred to the board’s office in Washington. The VA regional office 
will notify you in writing when your paperwork is ready to be transferred. 
Then the BVA will notify you in writing when it receives your file.
 
Until your file is transferred to the board, your local VA regional office is the 
best place to get information about your appeal. If your file is at the board, 
you can call 202-565-5436 to check on its status.
When your docket number finally comes up, your case is assigned to a board 
member who decides on your appeal. Think of him as a judge. These board 
members, who are attorneys experienced in veterans law and in reviewing 
benefit claims, are the only ones who can issue board decisions. Staff attor-
neys, also trained in veterans law, review the facts of each appeal and assist 
the board members.

50
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits 
Trying to speed up the waiting game
Get ready for a very, very long wait. There is a huge backlog of appeals on the 
docket, waiting for their turn to come up. In 2008, the average length of time 
it took to get an appeal decision after it had been placed on the docket was 
1,608 days, or nearly 4½ years. Yikes!
If you believe your case should be decided sooner than others that were filed 
before yours, you can request to have your case advanced on the docket. To 
submit a motion to advance on the docket, write directly to the board (not 
the VA regional office) and explain why your appeal should be moved ahead 
of other appeals.
Because most appeals involve some type of hardship, you need to show 
convincing proof of exceptional circumstances before your case can be 
advanced. Some examples of exceptional circumstances are terminal illness, 
danger of bankruptcy or foreclosure, or a VA error that caused a signifi-
cant delay in the docketing of an appeal. To file a motion to advance on the 
docket, send your request to Board of Veterans Appeals (014), Department of 
Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20420.
 
Don’t get your hopes up. Over the years, the BVA has granted fewer than 3 out 
of every 20 requests for advancement on the docket.
Making your case at a board hearing
In addition to a local office hearing (see the earlier “Preparing to send your 
appeal up the chain” section), you also have the right to present your case in 
person to a BVA member. In most areas, you can choose whether you want 
to have the BVA hearing at the local VA regional office, called a Travel Board 
hearing, or at the BVA office in Washington. Most VA regional offices are also 
equipped to hold BVA hearings by videoconference. Check with your regional 
office to see if a videoconference hearing is a possibility in your area.
Experts disagree about whether a personal hearing is advantageous to your 
claim. On one hand, it gives you the chance to verbally clarify and add to the 
supporting documentation submitted with your claim, and the transcript of the 
hearing is reviewed before a claims decision is made. On the other hand, the 
supporting evidence is the prime factor when making an appeal, not the hear-
ing, and requesting a hearing can add several months to the appeals process.
 
When deciding whether you want your hearing held at the BVA office in 
Washington or locally, keep in mind that the VA can’t pay for any of your 
expenses — such as lodging or travel — in connection with a hearing.

51
 Chapter 3: Navigating Your Way through the Red Tape of Claims and Appeals
VA Form 9 has a section for requesting a BVA hearing, and this is the usual 
way to request a hearing. However, if you didn’t ask for a BVA hearing on 
VA Form 9, you can still request one by writing directly to the board. This is 
subject to the 90-Day Rule, as explained in the “Getting on with the appeal” 
section. Make your request to Board of Veterans Appeals (014), Department 
of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20420.
 
If you want a BVA hearing, be sure you state whether you want it held at the 
regional office or at the board’s office in Washington, D.C. You can’t have a 
BVA hearing in both places.
When a hearing will be held depends on what type of hearing you request 
and where you request that it be held.
The scheduling of Travel Board hearings is more complicated because board 
members must travel from Washington to regional offices to conduct the 
hearings. Factors that affect when Travel Board hearings can be scheduled 
include the docket number, the total number of requests for hearings at a 
particular regional office, how soon the board will be able to review the cases 
associated with the hearings, and the resources, such as travel funds, avail-
able to the board.
 
Because videoconference hearings don’t involve travel by board members, 
they are less complicated to arrange and can be scheduled more frequently 
than Travel Board hearings.
Hearings held at the board’s offices in Washington, will be scheduled for a 
time close to when BVA will consider the case — ideally about three months 
before the case is reviewed.
Bracing yourself for the ultimate decision
When your appeal’s docket number is reached, your file is examined by a 
board member and a staff attorney who check for completeness and review 
all of your evidence and arguments, as well as the regional office’s Statement 
of the Case (and Supplemental Statement of the Case, if there is one), the tran-
script of your hearing (if you had one), the statement of your representative 
(if you have one), and any other information included in the claims folder. The 
staff attorney, at the board member’s direction, may also conduct additional 
research and prepare recommendations for the board member’s review.
The board member then decides whether to approve your appeal, deny 
your appeal, or remand it. A remand is an appeal that is returned to the VA 
regional office, usually to perform additional work on the case. After 

52
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits 
performing the additional work, the regional office may issue a new decision. 
If a claim is still denied, the case is returned to the board for a final decision. 
Your case keeps its original place on BVA’s docket, so it’s reviewed soon 
after it’s returned to the board.
If your claim is approved, the board notifies the VA regional office that has 
jurisdiction over your case, and it will start your benefits automatically. You 
won’t have to reapply to receive them.
If your appeal is denied, the board will send you a Notice of Appellate Rights 
letter that describes additional actions you can take.
 
Your decision will be mailed to the home address that the board has on file 
for you, so it’s extremely important that you keep the VA informed of your 
correct address. If you move or get a new home or work phone number, you 
should notify the regional office handling your appeal.
When All Else Fails: Appealing 
the Appeal
If the Board of Veterans Appeals denies your appeal, you’re not dead in 
the water yet. If you still believe that you’re entitled to the benefit(s) you 
claimed, you have three options: Ask the board to reconsider, ask the local 
VA regional office to reopen your appeal, or appeal the board’s decision to 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. I explain each of these options 
in the following sections.
Motion to reconsider
If you can demonstrate that the board made an obvious error of fact or law 
in its decision, you can file a written motion to reconsider your appeal. If you 
were represented at the time of the decision, you may want to consult with 
your representative for advice about whether you should file a motion (and 
for assistance in preparing one). There’s no specific VA form for this action.
If you do file a motion to reconsider, it should be sent directly to the board, 
not to your local VA regional office. Send the motion to Board of Veterans 
Appeals (014), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Ave., NW, 
Washington, DC 20420.

53
 Chapter 3: Navigating Your Way through the Red Tape of Claims and Appeals
 
You should not submit a motion to reconsider simply because you disagree 
with the BVA’s decision. You need to show that the board made a mistake in 
fact or law and that the board’s decision would have been different if the mis-
take had not been made.
Reopening an appeal
You can request that your VA regional office reopen your appeal, but only if 
you can submit new and material evidence. Because the VA is the king, and 
the king makes the rules, the VA decides whether your evidence is new and 
material. To be considered new and material, the evidence you submit must 
be information related to your case that wasn’t included in the claims folder 
when your case was decided.
For example, if your appeal was denied because the VA considers your dis-
charge characterization to be under dishonorable conditions (see Chapter 2), 
and you then persuade the Discharge Review Board to change your discharge 
characterization or discharge reason, this would be an example of new and 
material evidence.
If the VA regional office agrees to reopen your case, this starts the whole 
appeals process all over again.
U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims
Taking your appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is your 
final option. The court is an independent federal court that’s not part of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. You may appeal to the court only if the BVA 
has denied some or all of your benefits. You may not appeal a BVA decision 
to remand your claim back to the VA regional office.
Normally, to appeal a BVA decision, you must file the Notice of Appeal with 
the court within 120 days from the date the board’s decision is mailed.
 
If you filed a motion to reconsider with the BVA (see the “Motion to recon-
sider” section) within the 120-day time frame and that motion was denied, you 
have an additional 120 days to file the Notice of Appeal with the court. This 
120-day period begins on the date the BVA mails you a letter notifying you that 
it has denied your motion to reconsider.

54
Par t I: Benefiting From Benefits 
Filing your court appeal
You must file your appeal by mail or by fax. The court doesn’t accept 
electronic submissions. Send your Notice of Appeal, including your name, 
address, phone number, and the date of the BVA decision, to Clerk of the 
Court, U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, 625 Indiana Ave., NW, 
Washington, DC 20004, or fax it to 202-501-5848.
To be or not to be a lawyer: That is the question
Although you don’t have to have a lawyer to file an appeal, remember that 
this is a full-blown federal court, and it requires certain forms and has certain 
legal ways of doing things, just like any other court. I can guarantee that the 
VA is going to have its lawyer there to argue its side of the case. If you decide 
to represent yourself, you’ll be at a distinct disadvantage.
 
There is an old lawyers’ saying that a man who represents himself has a fool 
for a client.
 
If you do decide to represent yourself, at the very least, take a thorough look 
at the court’s Web site at www.vetapp.uscourts.gov.
Finding representation
The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims isn’t a criminal court, so the court 
can’t appoint an attorney to represent you. However, the clerk of the court 
maintains a list of attorneys who have been admitted to practice before the 
court and have expressed an interest in representing veterans who want to 
appeal denied claims. Although most of these lawyers charge a fee to repre-
sent clients, some of them will collect a fee only if you win your case or will 
accept the case without charging a fee. To view this list of attorneys, visit 
www.vetapp.uscourts.gov/practitioners.
 
In addition to the court’s list of attorneys, Congress, recognizing the difficul-
ties veterans and their dependents face in proceeding in a court case without a 
lawyer, has funded the Veterans Consortium Pro Bono Program. This program 
is a private, nonprofit organization that helps find lawyers who will represent 
veterans before the court free of charge. You can contact the organization 
through its Web site at www.vetsprobono.org or by calling 888-838-7727.

A Healthy Look at 
Medical Care and 
Compensation Programs

In this part . . .
I 
know of very few people who don’t worry about their 
healthcare needs and how they’re going to pay for 
medical care in the future. I also know of very few people 
who don’t care how much money they make each month. 
The two topics seem to go hand in hand. You need money 
(or a very good healthcare plan) to pay for your medical 
care, and you need to be in good health to earn the money 
to pay for your medical needs.
Many veterans are eligible for free or reduced-cost health-
care from the government for life. Have you checked into 
the cost of a doctor’s visit lately? These healthcare plans 
are valuable benefits that aren’t available to just anyone.
Additionally, depending on your situation, you may be eli-
gible to receive monthly payments from good old Uncle 
Sam. Through programs such as disability compensation, 
veterans pensions, and military retirement, the U.S. gov-
ernment puts millions of bucks into veterans’ pockets 
every single month. The chapters in this part tell you 
whether you qualify for these benefits. It also gives you 
information on the unpleasant-but-necessary topics of 
coverage for your survivors and burial and memorial 
benefits.

Chapter 4
Veterans Affairs Healthcare
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a peek at the VA medical package
▶ Qualifying for medical benefits
▶ Prioritizing your healthcare
▶ To pay or not to pay: That is the question
T
he Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system has gotten a 
bad rap through the years. For several years after Vietnam, Americans 
didn’t think very much of the military or veterans. This negative attitude was 
reflected in the amount of money that Congress made available to provide 
healthcare benefits for those who had served in the military. In short, the VA 
medical system was in an underfunded, understaffed shambles.
Oh, what a difference three decades (and a few extra billion bucks) make. 
Today, the VA operates one of the largest, most respected healthcare sys-
tems in the country. It treats about 5.3 million patients per year. About two-
thirds of physicians practicing in the U.S. received part or all of their medical 
training at VA medical centers. The VA trained more than 90,000 healthcare 
professionals in 2007 alone. The medical system is, by far, the largest benefit 
program the VA administers. Eighty-eight percent of VA employees work at 
VA medical centers.
Many veterans mistakenly believe that they can receive medical care from the 
VA only if they suffer from a medical condition that was caused by military ser-
vice. That’s incorrect. All veterans who meet the eligibility criteria I outline in 
this chapter are eligible for VA medical care. Have I gotten your attention yet? 
Now, aren’t you glad you made the wise decision to buy this book?

58
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Medical Benefits Package: The 
Backbone of the System
The VA medical system has changed over the years. It used to be reactive. 
In other words, the philosophy was, “Wait until it breaks, and then see if you 
can fix it.”
In October 1996, Congress passed the Veterans’ Health Care Eligibility 
Reform Act of 1996. This legislation paved the way for the creation of a 
Medical Benefits Package, a standard enhanced health benefits plan available 
to all veterans enrolled in it. The new philosophy is, “Let’s see if we can keep 
it from breaking.”
Once enrolled, veterans receive their healthcare at 155 VA medical centers 
(hospitals) and 881 outpatient clinics located throughout the United States 
and its territories. Appendix B has a complete list of VA medical centers.
VA medical centers and their associated outpatient clinics employ more than 
16,000 physicians and 62,000 nurses, who are willing and able to meet your 
healthcare needs.
When you first enroll (see the “Making your case for VA medical care” section), 
you’re assigned to the VA medical center closest to where you live. The fine 
folks who work there become your primary provider, and you receive most of 
your medical care from that VA medical facility or one of its outpatient clin-
ics. That doesn’t mean you get all your care there. If your chosen facility can’t 
provide the care you need in a reasonable period of time, it can refer you to 
another facility that can meet your needs.
 
You can also use your VA healthcare benefits when you travel. That’s right, 
they’re portable! Enrolled veterans who are traveling or who spend time away 
from their primary treatment facility may obtain care at any VA healthcare 
facility across the country without having to reapply (see the “VA Medical 
Care Eligibility and Enrollment” section).
What’s covered
Like other standard healthcare plans, the Medical Benefits Package empha-
sizes preventive and primary care, offering a full range of outpatient and 
inpatient services. I cover some of these in more detail in later sections, but 
for now here’s the main list:
 
✓ Outpatient and inpatient medical, surgical, and mental healthcare, 
including care for substance abuse.

59
 Chapter 4: Veterans Affairs Healthcare
 
✓ Prescription drugs, including over-the-counter drugs and medical and 
surgical supplies, when prescribed by a VA physician.
 
✓ Immunizations.
 
✓ Physical examinations, healthcare assessments, and screening tests.
 
✓ Health education programs.
 
✓ Emergency care in VA facilities.
 
✓ Dental care for eligible veterans.
 
✓ Bereavement counseling.
 
✓ Comprehensive rehabilitative services other than the vocational ser-
vices explained in Chapter 11.
 
✓ Consultation, professional counseling, training, and mental health ser-
vices for the veteran’s immediate family members or legal guardian.
 
✓ Durable medical equipment and prosthetic and orthotic devices. This 
includes eyeglasses and hearing aids for some veterans.
 
✓ Reconstructive (plastic) surgery required as a result of a disease or trauma, 
but not including cosmetic surgery that’s not medically necessary.
 
✓ Respite, hospice, and palliative care.
 
✓ Pregnancy and delivery service, to the extent authorized by law. This 
means the VA can provide services to the pregnant veteran, up to and 
including delivery, but can’t provide free services for the child. The 
veteran must reimburse the VA for any services associated with the 
child after birth.
What’s not covered
The preceding list of covered services probably seems to include everything 
but the kitchen sink, right? It really doesn’t. Under current laws, the VA isn’t 
allowed to provide the following services:
 
✓ Abortions and abortion counseling
 
✓ Cosmetic surgery except where determined by the VA to be medically 
necessary for reconstructive or psychiatric care
 
✓ Drugs, biologicals, and medical devices not approved by the FDA unless 
the treating medical facility is conducting formal clinical trials
 
✓ Gender alteration
 
✓ Health club or spa membership
 
✓ In vitro fertilization

60
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
 
✓ Services not ordered and provided by licensed or accredited 
professionals
 
✓ Special private-duty nursing
 
✓ Hospital and outpatient care for a veteran who is a patient or inmate in 
an institution of another government agency if that agency is required to 
provide care or services
 
✓ Emergency care in non-VA facilities, except as explained in the section 
“Emergency care in non-VA facilities” later in this chapter
Military sexual trauma counseling
The VA provides counseling and treatment to help male and female veterans 
overcome psychological trauma resulting from sexual trauma while serving 
on active duty. This counseling is usually conducted at VA vet centers. In 
addition to counseling, related services are available at VA medical facilities. 
You can find listings of VA medical facilities and vet centers in Appendix C 
and Appendix D, respectively.
You don’t have to enroll in the VA healthcare program to receive these ser-
vices. Veterans can receive care at no charge for conditions related to mili-
tary sexual trauma.
Bereavement counseling
VA healthcare facilities offer bereavement counseling to veterans who are 
enrolled in the VA healthcare program. This counseling is also available to 
their family members.
Bereavement counseling is also provided to parents, spouses, and children of 
armed forces personnel who died in the service of their country. Also eligible 
are family members of Reservists and National Guardsmen who die while on 
duty. Counseling is provided at VA vet centers located throughout the United 
States. Check out Appendix D to find the nearest vet center location.
Assistance for blind veterans
In addition to other healthcare benefits listed in this chapter, blind veterans 
may be eligible for additional services or for admission to a VA blind rehabili-
tation center or clinic. Services are available at all VA medical facilities 
(see Appendix C). Aids and services for blind veterans include:

61
 Chapter 4: Veterans Affairs Healthcare
 
✓ A total health and benefits review by a VA visual impairment services team
 
✓ Adjustment-to-blindness training
 
✓ Home improvements and structural alterations to homes
 
✓ Specially adapted housing and adaptations
 
✓ Low-vision aids and training in their use
 
✓ Electronic and mechanical aids for the blind, including adaptive comput-
ers and computer-assisted devices such as reading machines and elec-
tronic travel aids
 
✓ Guide dogs, including the expense of training the veteran to use the dog 
and the cost of the dog’s medical care
 
✓ Talking books, tapes, and Braille literature
Prosthetics and adaptive automobiles
Enrolled veterans receiving VA care for any condition may receive medi-
cally necessary VA prosthetic appliances, equipment, and devices, such as 
artificial limbs, orthopedic braces and shoes, wheelchairs, crutches and 
canes, and other durable medical equipment and supplies. If you need the 
prosthetic items for a service-connected disability or you have been rated 
as being 50 percent disabled by the VA (as explained in Chapter 6), you 
may receive prosthetic items from the VA, even if you’re not enrolled in the 
healthcare program.
You may qualify for adaptive automobile assistance from the VA if you have 
any of the following:
 
✓ A service-connected loss or permanent loss of use of one or both hands 
or feet
 
✓ A permanent impairment of vision of both eyes to a certain degree
 
✓ Entitlement to VA disability compensation (see Chapter 6) for ankylosis 
(immobility) of one or both knees or one or both hips
The VA provides a one-time payment of not more than $11,000 toward the 
purchase of an automobile or other vehicle. The VA also pays for adaptive 
equipment and for repair, replacement, or reinstallation required because of 
your disability.

Taking care of your smile: VA dental care
VA dental care may or may not be something you want to smile about, 
depending on your situation. It’s not available to all veterans enrolled in the

 Chapter 4: Veterans Affairs Healthcare
All the better to see and hear 
you with: Eyes and ears
Although you can get vision and hearing exams while enrolled in the VA 
healthcare program, you can’t get free eyeglasses or hearing aids for normal 
vision and hearing loss unless you
 
✓ Receive an increased pension for regular aid and attendance or being 
permanently housebound, as explained in Chapter 6
 
✓ Receive disability compensation for a service-connected disability (see 
Chapter 6)
 
✓ Are a former prisoner of war
 
✓ Received a Purple Heart medal
Getting your meds from VA pharmacies
The VA will provide you with medications that are prescribed by VA provid-
ers in conjunction with VA medical care. Medications are prescribed from 
an approved list of medications called a formulary. When your VA physician 
writes a prescription, you get it filled at the pharmacy located within the VA 
medical facility. Appendix C has a listing of such facilities.
Getting your fill of refills
The VA doesn’t provide routine refills at its pharmacy windows unless there 
are special circumstances. You can get refills of your VA-prescribed medica-
tions in two ways:
 
✓ Through the routine refill program: You can request medication refills 
by mailing the refill notice provided to you at the time of your original 
fill. Your order will be processed through the VA’s pharmacy mail-out 
program. To ensure you receive your medication promptly, you’ll want 
to order refills at least 20 days before you run out of medication.
 
 Some VA pharmacies have toll-free automated telephone refill systems. 
Check with the VA pharmacy that filled your original prescription to see 
if it has this capability.
 
✓ Online through the VA’s “MyHealtheVet” Web site: This is probably 
the easiest way to manage your prescription refills. The prescription 
service on the site is designed exclusively for VA patients to manage 
medications prescribed by VA doctors. To access Prescription Refill, you 
need to be a registered user of My HealtheVet. The service is available at 
www.myhealth.va.gov.

64
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
What about filling non-VA prescriptions?
The VA won’t fill or rewrite prescriptions prescribed by your private physician. 
If you see a non-VA provider and want to have prescriptions filled by the VA, 
you must meet all the following conditions:
 
✓ You must be enrolled in VA healthcare. See the “Making your case for 
VA medical care” section.
 
✓ You need to have a primary-care provider assigned by the VA.
 
✓ You must provide your VA healthcare provider with your medical 
records from your non-VA provider.
 
✓ Your VA healthcare provider has to agree with the medication 
prescribed by your non-VA provider.
 
Your VA healthcare provider is under no obligation to prescribe a medication 
recommended by a non-VA provider.
Emergency care in non-VA facilities
Certain conditions must be met in order for the VA to pay for emergency care 
you may receive in non-VA facilities. You’re eligible for emergency care in a 
non-VA medical facility if the care is provided in connection with a disability 
or medical condition that the VA has determined to be connected with your 
service in the military, according to the procedures explained in Chapter 6.
To reimburse for such care, the VA must determine that VA healthcare facili-
ties weren’t readily available; that a delay in medical attention would have 
endangered your life or health; and that you’re personally liable for the cost 
of the services.
For example, if you have a service-connected injury to your leg and a car hits 
you and aggravates the injury, the VA wouldn’t pay for the care if the driver 
of the car was liable for your injury. On the other hand, if you slipped and fell 
in the bathtub and aggravated the injury, the VA would pay, assuming you 
had no other healthcare plan that would pay.
Congress has also given the VA authority to pay for emergency care in 
non-VA facilities for veterans enrolled in the VA healthcare system under cer-
tain circumstances. This benefit pays for emergency care rendered for non-
service-connected conditions for enrolled veterans who have no other source 
of payment for the care. To qualify you must meet all the following criteria:
 
✓ You received emergency care in a non-VA medical facility, such as a 
hospital emergency room.
 
✓ You’re enrolled in the VA healthcare system. See the “Making your case 
for VA medical care” section.

65
 Chapter 4: Veterans Affairs Healthcare
 
✓ You have been provided care by a VA healthcare provider within the 
last 24 months.
 
✓ You’re financially liable to the provider of the emergency treatment for 
that treatment.
 
✓ You have no other form of healthcare insurance, including Medicare, 
Medicaid, state programs, or Tricare (which is explained in Chapter 5).
 
✓ You have no other contractual or legal recourse against a third party 
that will pay all or part of the bill.
 
✓ VA or other federal facilities (such as military hospitals) weren’t readily 
available at time of the emergency.
 
✓ The medical condition required immediate care. If delaying treatment 
in order to use a VA facility would have been hazardous to your life or 
health, the VA will pay for emergency room care in a non-VA facility. The 
VA isn’t going to pay for your treatment if you go to the emergency room 
for a hangnail.
 
You shouldn’t cancel any current healthcare insurance just to be eligible 
for non-VA emergency treatment. Remember that your spouse and children 
don’t qualify for the VA healthcare program. If you cancel your current insur-
ance, your family may not retain health insurance coverage. If you’re covered 
by Medicare Part B and you decide to cancel it, it can’t be reinstated until 
January of the next year.
If you are hospitalized after emergency care, the VA will be in regular contact 
with your physician at the private hospital. As soon as your condition 
stabilizes, the VA will arrange to move you to a VA or VA-designated facility.
 
The VA will pay for your emergency care services only until your condition is 
stabilized. If you voluntarily stay beyond that point, you will assume responsi-
bility for the payment of costs associated with treatment.
VA Medical Care Eligibility 
and Enrollment
Like most veterans benefits, in order to be eligible for VA medical care, you 
must first have a military discharge that the VA determines is other than 
dishonorable. (I explain how the VA makes this determination in Chapter 2.) If 
you’re good to go on your discharge characterization, you must meet the 
minimum military service requirements. After you’ve established your eli-
gibility, you need to know what priority group you fit into, how and where 
to enroll, and when you can begin to use the VA’s healthcare service. These 
topics are covered in the upcoming sections.

66
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Minimum service requirements
If you have even one day of active-duty service before September 8, 1980, as 
an enlisted member, or before October 17, 1981, as an officer, you’re eligible 
for benefits.
Otherwise, you must have 24 months of continuous active-duty military service 
to be eligible for VA medical benefits, unless you meet one of the following 
exceptions:
 
✓ You were a Reservist or member of the National Guard who was called 
to federal active duty, and you completed the entire term for which you 
were called.
 
✓ You were discharged from active duty for reasons of a hardship.
 
✓ You were discharged with an early out (that is, during a time when the 
military was undergoing a downsizing).
 
✓ You were discharged or released from active duty for a disability that 
began in the service or got worse because of the service.
 
✓ You have been determined by the VA to have a service-connected dis-
ability, entitling you to compensation as I explain in Chapter 6.
 
✓ You were discharged for a reason other than disability, but you had a 
medical condition at the time that was disabling and, in the opinion of a 
doctor, would have justified a discharge for disability. In this case, the 
disability must have been documented in your military medical records. 
(See Chapter 2 for more information about military medical records.)
You also don’t have to meet the minimum service requirements if you are 
only seeking medical benefits for or in connection with
 
✓ A service-connected condition or disability (see Chapter 6)
 
✓ Treatment and/or counseling of sexual trauma that occurred while on 
active military service (see the earlier section in this chapter)
 
✓ Treatment of conditions related to ionizing radiation
 
✓ Head or neck cancer related to nose or throat radium treatment while in 
the military
Make sure you join the right group!
Just because you’re eligible for VA healthcare doesn’t necessarily mean 
you’re going to get it. The number of veterans who can be enrolled in the 
healthcare program is determined by the amount of money Congress gives 

67
 Chapter 4: Veterans Affairs Healthcare
the VA each year. Because Congress never gives the VA as much money as 
it needs, the VA has established priority groups to make sure that certain 
groups of veterans can be enrolled before others. There are eight catego-
ries, with Group 1 as the highest priority for enrollment in the VA healthcare 
system.
 
If you’re eligible for more than one category, the VA places you in the highest 
category for which you are eligible.
Some of the groups contain requirements that are a bit complicated, but 
most are pretty straightforward. Here’s an overview of each group:
 
✓ Group 1, 50 percent disabled: Veterans whom the VA has rated as 50 per-
cent or more disabled with a service-connected disability, as described in 
Chapter 6, receive this highest category rating. Also included are veter-
ans whom the VA has determined to be unemployable, as explained in 
Chapters 6 and 11.
 
✓ Group 2, 30 percent disabled: Veterans with VA-rated service-
connected disabilities of 30 or 40 percent disabling (see Chapter 6) are 
placed in Group 2.
 
✓ Group 3, 10 percent disabled: Veterans whom the VA has determined 
have a 10 or 20 percent service-connected disability, as described in 
Chapter 6, are placed into this category. Also included in this category are
 
• Veterans who are former prisoners of war (POWs)
 
• Veterans awarded a Purple Heart
 
• Veterans whose discharge was for a disability that happened or 
was aggravated in the line of duty
 
• Veterans who became disabled because of treatment or vocational 
rehabilitation from a VA facility
 
✓ Group 4, Veterans receiving aid: Veterans who receive a VA pension, 
along with additional monthly compensation from the VA because they 
require in-home aid and assistance or are housebound, make up the 
majority of Group 4 participants. (I explain these programs in Chapter 6.)
 
 Also included in this category are veterans whom the VA considers to be 
catastrophically disabled, even if the disability is not service-connected.
 
 Catastrophically disabled means a severe, permanent disability that requires 
personal or mechanical assistance to leave the bed or house, or 
requires constant supervision to avoid harm.
 
✓ Group 5, Veterans receiving pensions: This group includes veterans 
who receive a VA pension or those eligible to receive a VA pension, as 
explained in Chapter 6.

68
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
 
 Also included are veterans who have income and assets below the VA’s 
national income limit, as detailed in the “Addressing Financial Concerns” 
section.
 
 Veterans who are eligible for state Medicaid programs are also eligible 
for Group 5.
 
✓ Group 6, Special periods of service: This category is for World War I 
veterans and veterans who served in a combat zone after November 11, 
1998, as follows:
 
• Veterans discharged from active duty on or after January 28, 2003, 
who were enrolled in the VA healthcare system as of January 28, 2008.
 
• Veterans who apply for enrollment after January 28, 2008. Such 
veterans may enroll and be placed automatically in Group 6 for five 
years post-discharge.
 
• Veterans discharged from active duty before January 28, 2003, who 
apply for enrollment after January 28, 2008, until January 27, 2011.
 
 To be automatically qualified for Group 6 placement for service after 
November 11, 1998, you must have served at least one day in a 
designated combat zone.
 
 Veterans who have a service-connected medical condition or disabil-
ity that is rated as zero percent disabling by the VA, as explained in 
Chapter 6, are also eligible for this category.
 
 Veterans who were exposed to ionizing radiation as a result of testing, 
development, or employment of the atom bomb in World War II are also 
qualified for Group 6. Atomic veterans may have been exposed to ioniz-
ing radiation in a variety of ways at various locations. Veterans exposed 
at a nuclear device testing site (the Pacific Islands, Bikini, New Mexico, 
Nevada, and so on) or during the occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 
Japan, are included.
 
 Group 6 also includes Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent 
Orange while serving in Vietnam. To be eligible, you must have served 
on active duty in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, and 
suffer from one of the following conditions that the National Academy of 
Sciences found evidence of a possible association with herbicide exposure:
 
• Acute and subacute peripheral neuropathy
 
• Adult-onset (Type 2) diabetes
 
• Chloracne
 
• Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
 
• Hodgkin’s disease
 
• Multiple myeloma
 
• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma

69
 Chapter 4: Veterans Affairs Healthcare
 
• Porphyria cutanea tarda
 
• Primary amyloidosis
 
• Prostate cancer
 
• Respiratory cancers (cancer of the lung, bronchus, larynx, or tra-
chea)
 
• Soft-tissue sarcoma (other than osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, 
Kaposi’s sarcoma, or mesothelioma)
 
 Gulf War veterans, including those who served in Operations Desert 
Shield, Desert Storm, and Iraqi Freedom, who suffer from any of the sev-
eral medical conditions grouped together into what is called “Gulf War 
Illness,” are placed in Group 6.
 
 For more information than you’ll ever want to know concerning Gulf War 
Illness, visit the VA’s Web site at www1.va.gov/gulfwar.
 
 Also included in Group 6 are veterans who were participants in Project 
112/SHAD (you know who you are).
 
 For those of you who don’t know about Project 112/SHAD, I can tell you, 
but if you read further, I’ll have to kill you. I’m just kidding. This project 
was declassified years ago. Project SHAD, an acronym for Shipboard 
Hazard and Defense, was part of a larger effort called Project 112, 
which was conducted during the 1960s. Project SHAD consisted of tests 
designed to identify U.S. warships’ vulnerabilities to attacks with chemi-
cal or biological warfare agents and to develop procedures to respond 
to such attacks while maintaining a war-fighting capability. Participants 
on Navy ships were exposed to various chemical and biological “simu-
lates.” Unfortunately, it was later found that many of these “simulates” 
weren’t as medically harmless as was thought at the time.
 
✓ Group 7, Veterans with low incomes: This category is for veterans who 
don’t qualify for Groups 1 through 6 and have an annual income or net 
worth above the VA’s national income limit, but their income is below 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) income 
threshold for the area in which they live. More details about the VA’s 
national income limits and the geographical income threshold are in the 
“Addressing Financial Concerns” section.
 
 Veterans with income limits below both the national income limits and 
HUD’s geographic income threshold are placed in Group 5.
 
 Veterans placed in Group 7 must agree to pay co-pays, as explained in 
the “Addressing Financial Concerns” section.
 
✓ Group 8, All others: This includes veterans who don’t fit into one of 
the first seven categories. It mostly includes veterans who have an 
annual income or net worth above both the VA’s national income limit 
and HUD’s geographic income threshold. See the “Addressing Financial 

70
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Concerns” section for more information about these two income 
measurements.
 
 As with Group 7, veterans in Group 8 must agree to pay for a portion of 
their medical care, as described in the “Addressing Financial Concerns” 
section.
 
 Effective January 16, 2003, the VA no longer accepts new enrollments in 
Group 8. Veterans who enrolled in the VA healthcare system before this 
date, and remain enrolled, are still eligible for this category. For example, 
if you were enrolled in Group 7, but your income level increases beyond 
the limits required for that category, you can still be moved to 
Category 8. This policy only affects new enrollments.
Making your case for VA medical care
You can apply for VA healthcare by completing VA Form 10-10EZ, Application 
for Health Benefits. You can obtain this form from any of the VA medical centers 
listed in Appendix C. You can also request that a copy of this form be mailed 
to you by calling the VA’s Health Benefits Service Center toll free at 877-222-
VETS (877-222-8387) Monday through Friday between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. (east-
ern time). The VA Form 10-10EZ is also available for download at https://
www.1010ez.med.va.gov/sec/vha/1010ez/Form/vha-10-10ez.pdf.
Mail the completed form to the VA medical center of your choice.
 
You can also apply in person at the VA medical center of your choice. This 
may be a good idea because VA staff members can assist you in completing 
the form.
If you’re not already enrolled in the VA system (that is, you’ve not applied for 
other VA benefits), you should also include proof of your military service and 
discharge characterization. Chapter 2 has information about these important 
documents.
The VA will notify you by mail when you’re enrolled and inform you which 
priority group you’ve been placed in (see the “Make sure you join the right 
group!” section).
Not everyone is required to enroll
Most veterans must enroll in the VA healthcare program to receive medi-
cal benefits. However, every rule has its exceptions, as I sometimes tell the 
police officer who stops me for speeding. You don’t have to be enrolled if you

71
 Chapter 4: Veterans Affairs Healthcare
 
✓ Have been determined by the VA to be 50 percent or more disabled from 
service-connected conditions (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Are seeking care for a VA-rated, service-connected disability only.
 
✓ Were discharged less than one year ago for a disability that the military 
determined was a result of or aggravated by your service, but that the 
VA has not yet rated (see Chapter 6).
If any of these situations applies to you, you can contact any VA medical 
center (see Appendix C) and make an appointment for medical care, even if 
you’re not enrolled in the VA healthcare program.
Making your first appointment
You don’t have to wait until your enrollment is approved to make your first 
appointment for medical care. If you’re applying in person, you can make an 
appointment when you apply. If you’re not applying in person, the application 
form has an area where you can request that an appointment be scheduled.
Not all veterans are created equal. When scheduling appointments, the VA 
uses a priority system. Those with service-connected disabilities of 50 per-
cent or more and those seeking care for a service-connected medical condi-
tion get first crack. The VA guarantees to make them an appointment within 
30 days (although it’s usually much sooner). All other veterans are scheduled 
for a primary-care appointment as soon as one becomes available.
Seeking Extended Care
Extended care is care outside of the traditional hospital environment. The VA 
extended care program includes such services as nursing homes, domicili-
aries, and other programs.
Depending on your financial situation, VA extended care may cost you. For 
more information about possible co-pays, see the “Addressing Financial 
Concerns” section.
The VA’s nursing home programs include
 
✓ Community living centers: These centers are designed for veterans with 
chronic stable conditions including dementia, those requiring rehabilita-
tion or short-term specialized services such as respite or intravenous 
therapy, or those who need comfort and care at the end of life. The 

72
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
centers’ primary purpose is to restore residents to maximum function, 
prevent further decline, maximize independence, or provide comfort 
when dying. Generally, they are designed to provide short-term, 
restorative, and rehabilitative care up to 100 days.
 
✓ Contract community nursing homes: Intended for longer-term care than 
community living centers, community nursing homes are commercial 
operations that are under contract to a VA medical center to provide 
nursing home services to enrolled veterans who reside in the community. 
They provide compassionate care and an entire range of medical services 
to veterans who can no longer care for themselves.
 
✓ State veterans homes: A state home is owned and operated by a state. 
The home may provide nursing home care, domiciliary care, and/or 
adult day care. The VA pays a percentage of the cost of construction or 
renovation and/or per diem costs to the state. In addition, the VA checks 
up on state homes through annual inspections, audits, and reconcilia-
tion of records to make sure the state veterans homes are meeting VA 
standards for quality of care.
To receive extended care under the VA nursing home program, you must be
 
✓ A veteran who has a service-connected disability rating of 70 percent or 
more. See Chapter 6 for information about service-connection and dis-
ability ratings.
 
✓ A veteran who has a 60 percent service-connected disability rating and 
is unemployable, or has an official rating of “permanent and totally dis-
abled.” Again, Chapter 6 has more details.
 
✓ A veteran with a combined disability rating of 70 percent or more. 
Chapter 6 includes a table that shows how the VA computes combined 
disability ratings.
 
✓ A veteran whose service-connected disability is clinically determined to 
require nursing home care.
 
✓ A veteran with a service-connected or non-service-connected disability 
with income and assets below the VA’s national income limits and HUD’s 
geographical income threshold, explained in the “Addressing Financial 
Concerns” section.
 
✓ If space and resources are available, other veterans on a case-by-case 
basis with priority given to veterans with service-connected disabilities 
and those who need care for rehabilitation, respite, hospice, geriatric 
evaluation and management, or spinal cord injury.

73
 Chapter 4: Veterans Affairs Healthcare
Domiciliary care is a residential rehabilitation program that provides short-
term rehabilitation and long-term health maintenance to veterans who 
require minimal medical care while they recover from medical, psychiatric, 
or psychosocial problems. Most domiciliary patients return to the commu-
nity after a period of rehabilitation. An example would be a residential drug 
or alcohol treatment program.
Other services under the VA’s extended care program include
 
✓ Hospice/palliative care, which provides comfort and support in the 
advanced stages of a terminal disease.
 
✓ Respite care, which temporarily relieves the spouse or other caregiver 
from the burden of caring for a chronically ill or disabled veteran at home.
 
✓ Geriatric evaluation and management (GEM), which evaluates and 
manages older veterans with multiple medical, functional, or psycho-
logical problems and those with particular geriatric problems. Veterans 
enrolled in this program receive assessment and treatment from an 
interdisciplinary team of VA health professionals.
 
✓ Community residential care, which provides room, board, limited per-
sonal care, and supervision to veterans who don’t require hospital or 
nursing home care but can’t live independently because of medical or 
psychiatric conditions, and who have no family to provide care.
 
✓ Home healthcare, which provides long-term primary medical care to 
chronically ill veterans in their own homes under the coordinated care 
of an interdisciplinary treatment team.
 
✓ Adult day care, which provides health maintenance and rehabilitative 
services to veterans in a group setting during daytime hours.
 
✓ Homemaker/home health aide services, which provides health-related 
services for veterans needing nursing home care. These services are 
provided by public and private agencies under a case management 
system provided by VA medical staff.
Addressing Financial Concerns
I know you’re probably concerned about your finances. I know I always am. 
You’re probably wondering how much all these health goodies will cost? 
That depends on several factors. In some cases, there may be no cost at 
all. In other cases, you may have to share a portion of the costs for your VA 
healthcare. In still other cases, the VA may even pay you to come see them. 
When’s the last time you were in a healthcare plan that paid you to go see the 
doctor?

74
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Travel reimbursement
In some cases, the VA pays you to travel to the VA medical facility to receive 
care. You’re eligible for travel reimbursement of 28.5 cents per mile if you 
meet one of the following conditions:
 
✓ You have a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more, as 
detailed in Chapter 6.
 
✓ You’re traveling for treatment of a service-related condition.
 
✓ You receive a VA pension, described in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Your income doesn’t exceed the maximum annual VA pension rate (see 
Chapter 6).
 
✓ You’re traveling for a scheduled examination to determine your 
eligibility for VA disability compensation or pension (Chapter 6).
You are eligible to receive reimbursement for special transportation (ambu-
lance, wheelchair van, and so on) if you meet one of the first four criteria listed 
here and the travel is preauthorized by the VA (preauthorization isn’t neces-
sary for emergencies if a delay would be hazardous to your life or health).
If you are traveling for medical care under one of the first two conditions, 
your travel is subject to a deductible of $7.77 per one-way trip ($15.54 for 
a round trip). However, the maximum deductible you’d have to pay in one 
month is $46.62. After that amount is reached, the rest of your trips during 
that month aren’t subject to the deductible.
 
If, through no fault of your own, you must return to the VA medical facility, to 
repeat a lab test, X-ray, or other exam to obtain VA disability compensation 
or VA pension (see Chapter 6), the VA will pay you 17 cents per mile in travel 
reimbursement. This payment isn’t subject to the travel deductible.
Co-pays for medical care
If you’re in priority Groups 1 through 5 (see the “Make sure you join the right 
group!” section), you’re not required to share in the costs of your inpatient or 
outpatient medical care obtained through the VA.
If you’ve been placed in Group 6, you don’t have to pay any cost-share for VA 
medical treatment you receive for a service-connected medical condition or 
disability. However, if you receive medical care from the VA for conditions 
that aren’t connected to your military service, you’re required to pay the full 
co-pay amounts shown in Table 4-2.

Veterans in Group 7 must pay 80 percent of the co-pay rates listed in Table 4-2 
for inpatient care and the full rate for outpatient care. Those in Group 8 pay the 
full co-pay.
For specialty care, which includes services provided by a clinical specialist 
such as a surgeon, radiologist, audiologist, optometrist, and cardiologist, as 
well as specialty tests such as magnetic resonance imagery (MRI), computer-
ized axial tomography (CAT) scan, and nuclear medicine studies, the co-pay 
is $50 per visit.
 
Co-pays don’t apply to publicly announced VA health fairs or outpatient visits 
solely for preventive screening, health education classes, smoking secession 
programs, and/or immunizations. Laboratory, flat film radiology, and electro-
cardiograms are also exempt from co-pays.
Co-pays for extended care
If you’re enrolled in Groups 1 through 4 (see the “Make sure you join the right 
group!” section), you don’t have to pay anything to receive extended care 
(see the “Seeking Extended Care” section).
Those in Group 5 must pay a co-pay, unless they receive a VA pension or 
have assets and income levels that would qualify them for a VA pension (see 
Chapter 6). Veterans placed in Group 6 must pay the co-pay, unless they are 
receiving extended care for a service-connected disability or condition that 
resulted in their placement in Group 6. If you’ve been placed in Group 7 or 8, 
you must pay the applicable co-pay for extended care.
 
Unlike co-pays for medical treatment and prescriptions, there are no set fees 
for extended care co-pays. Instead, the VA determines your co-pay (up to the 
maximum amount allowed) based on your particular income level and assets.
The VA makes this determination based on financial information you pro-
vide on VA Form 10-10EC, Application for Extended Care Services. This form 

76
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
is available at any VA medical facility (see Appendix C) or online at www.
va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/vha-10-10EC-fill.pdf.
The maximum co-pay for inpatient extended care facilities, which includes 
nursing homes, respite centers, geriatric evaluation centers, community 
residential care, home healthcare, and homemaker/home health aid services, 
is $97 per day. Outpatient extended care can include geriatric evaluation, 
respite, adult day care, and hospice/palliative services. The maximum co-pay 
for these services is $15 per day. The maximum amount you can be required 
to pay for domiciliary care is $5 per day.
 
Co-pays for extended care services start on the 22nd day of care. The first 21 
days are free.
Co-pay for VA medications
You may also be required to pay a share of the costs for prescription medica-
tions and refills you receive from the VA.
Those in Group 1 or 4 aren’t required to pay a co-pay for their VA medications. 
(See the section, “Make sure you join the right group!” earlier in this chapter.) 
If you’re in Group 2, 3, or 5, you don’t have to share in the costs of your medi-
cation if you are an ex-prisoner of war, require medication for treatment of a 
service-connected medical condition, or have an income below the VA pen-
sion level, as described in Chapter 6. Veterans who are placed in Group 6 may 
receive free medication if it’s required to treat a medical condition associated 
with their placement in Group 6. Individuals in Group 7 or 8 must pay the 
medication co-pay amount of $8 per 30-day supply.
 
There is a medication co-pay cap (the most you will have to pay) of $960 per 
calendar year for all enrolled veterans except those in Group 7 or 8.
 
All co-pays are subject to change at the whims of Congress. For current co-pay 
amounts, visit the VA’s Web site at www.va.gov/healtheligibility/
Library/pubs/CopayGlance/CopayGlance.pdf.
Using private health insurance
If you have other healthcare insurance, the VA is required to bill your private 
health insurance provider for medical care, supplies, and prescriptions pro-
vided for treatment of non-service-connected conditions. This includes your 
spouse’s healthcare insurance, if you are covered under it. Generally, 
however, the VA can’t bill Medicare, but it can bill Medicare supplemental 
health insurance for covered services.

77
 Chapter 4: Veterans Affairs Healthcare
When you apply for VA medical care (see the “Making your case for VA medi-
cal care” section), you’re required to provide information on other health 
insurance coverage, including coverage provided under your spouse’s policy.
 
This doesn’t mean you should dump your private medical insurance to make 
sure the VA will pay for all your care. Remember, you may have a spouse or 
family member covered under a private plan. Also, there’s no guarantee that 
in subsequent years Congress will appropriate sufficient funds for the VA to 
provide care for all enrollment priority groups (see the “Making sure you join 
the right group!” section). If this happens and you’re enrolled in one of the 
lower priority groups, you’d be without healthcare coverage.
Dealing with VA income limits
The VA uses two financial means to determine veteran placement into 
Groups 7 and 8 (see the “Making sure you join the right group!” section ear-
lier in the chapter). You’re eligible for placement in Group 7 if your income 
is above the VA’s national income limit but below the geographical income 
threshold; you can be placed in Group 8 if it’s above both standards.
National income limits
The national income limits measure your household income and total assets 
against the national mean. The maximum household income limits also affect 
whether you receive free VA medical care or are subject to co-pays.
Income includes all gross household income (money earned by you, your 
spouse, and any kids who live at home), including Social Security, retirement 
pay, unemployment insurance, interest and dividends, workers’ compensa-
tion, black lung benefits, and any other gross household income. The 2008 
national income limits are shown in Table 4-3.

In addition to the income levels shown in Table 4-3, you must have a net 
worth of $80,000 or less. Net worth includes assets such as the market value 
of property (excluding your primary residence), stocks, bonds, notes, indi-
vidual retirement accounts, bank deposits, savings accounts, and cash.
 
These rates can change. For the latest rates, see www.va.gov/
healtheligibility/Library/pubs/VAIncomeThresholds/
VAIncomeThresholds.pdf.
Geographical income threshold
The VA also compares your financial assessments with geographically based 
income thresholds. If your income is above the VA national means test (Table 
4-3) but below the geographic income threshold, you qualify to be placed 
in Group 7, which means you get a 20 percent reduction in inpatient co-pay 
rates (see the “Co-pays for medical care” section).
The geographic rates depend on where you live, right down to the indi-
vidual county. Because there are a few thousand counties and parishes in 
the United States, reproducing the list here would make this book massive, 
thereby significantly increasing its cost. See how I look out for your wel-
fare? You’re very welcome. You can look up the latest limits online at www.

In This Chapter
▶ Pursuing a positive medical plan

▶ Taking a dose of medicine
▶ Preparing yourself for what you’ll pay
▶ Details about dental and vision care
I
’m probably not the best person in the world to write this chapter. I hate 
going to the doctor. I absolutely despise going to the dentist. To me, doc-
tors and dentists are evil. They spend most of your allotted appointment 
time telling you that you’re no longer allowed to do the things you love to 
do, instructing you to start doing things that you hate to do, and command-
ing that you not eat the foods you love to eat. They do things to you that are 
uncomfortable and sometimes downright painful. Then they have the gall to 
charge you for all of this.
However, as age continues to creep up on me, I’m discovering that doctors 
and dentists are often necessary. My girlfriend is a nurse and informs me that 
such medical professionals can be extremely beneficial at times. Who am I to 
argue with her? I never win arguments with her, in any case.
At least I don’t have to pay an arm and a leg for the services of these medical 
professionals. I belong to that special group of veterans who are authorized 
to participate in Tricare, the military’s version of health insurance. So I have 
some personal knowledge of the program as I give you details about the dif-
ferent plans and their costs in this chapter.

80
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Tricare: Pick a Plan, Any Plan
Tricare is the military’s health insurance program that covers everyone — 
active-duty members, retirees, and their families. However, retirees and their 
dependents have to chip in for the cost of coverage (see “How Much Does All 
of This Cost?” for more details); medical care is free for those who are still 
serving and their families. Because this is a book about veterans benefits, and 
because I have to keep this guide from becoming a novel (even though I’ve 
always wanted to write a novel), I’m limiting the information in this chapter 
to that which affects the veteran and the veteran’s family members — in 
other words, those no longer in the military.
For veterans and their authorized family members, Tricare comes in four 
flavors, depending on your needs:
 
✓ Tricare Prime
 
✓ Tricare Extra
 
✓ Tricare Standard
 
✓ Tricare for Life
Tricare Prime: An HMO by another name
The Tricare Prime option is very much like an HMO, or health maintenance 
organization. Like an HMO, you’re assigned to a primary care provider (PCP). 
This is usually, although not always, a military medical facility (on-base hos-
pital or medical clinic). You receive most of your healthcare needs through 
the PCP. Like most HMOs, in order to receive care from a specialist you must 
first receive a referral from your PCP.
Tricare Prime requires you to enroll and pay an annual enrollment fee; plus 
you pay a small fee (called a cost-share in the military) each time you receive 
medical care (see the “How Much Does All of This Cost?” section in this chap-
ter). When you receive medical care under Tricare Prime, you don’t have to 
file a reimbursement claim. The provider automatically does this for you.
 
Tricare Prime is the most cost-effective Tricare option, but you generally have 
to live close to a military base to take advantage of it. However, many military 
retirees choose to live near a military base because of the on-base shopping 
discounts they receive (see Chapter 15).
To enroll in Tricare Prime, you must fill out some paperwork. Enrollment 
forms are available online at www.tricare.mil/mybenefit/Forms.do or 
at any military medical facility.

81
 Chapter 5: Tricare: The Military’s Health Insurance
Tricare Extra: When an HMO just won’t do
The Tricare Extra program gives you more flexibility than Tricare Prime, but 
it can result in additional costs. If you’re eligible for Tricare benefits, you 
don’t need to enroll in advance to use Tricare Extra. You’re enrolled automat-
ically the first time you use any benefits and present your military or depen-
dent ID card as an insurance card to the provider.
Under this program, you can go to any Tricare network provider (TNP), 
present your military or dependent ID card, and receive medical care. 
There are thousands of TNPs across the country. You can find a TNP close 
to you by visiting www.tricare.mil/mybenefit/home/Medical/
FindingAProvider. The TNPs have a contract with the military to limit 
costs to designated amounts.
Under Tricare Extra, you pay an annual deductible. After the deductible 
is paid, Tricare pays 80 percent of the medical expenses, and you pay 20 
percent of the authorized costs (see the “How Much Does All of This Cost?” 
section for details). TNPs have also agreed to do all the paperwork for you. 
Under Tricare Extra, you don’t have to file claims to be reimbursed.
Tricare Standard: A little more cost 
equals much more freedom
The Tricare Standard program gives you the greatest flexibility, but it costs 
the most. Under this program, you can see just about any medical provider 
you want. As with Tricare Extra, you pay an annual deductible. In addition to 
the deductible, you have to pay 25 percent of what Tricare says the medical 
service should cost (see the “How Much Does All of This Cost” section).
 
If you want to find out what the Tricare allowable cost is for a particular 
medical procedure, use the nifty search tool at www.tricare.mil/
allowablecharges.
Medical providers under Tricare Standard can be broken into two groups:
 
✓ Participating providers: Participating providers, although they’re not 
under contract as a TNP (Tricare network provider), have agreed to file 
claims for you, accept payment directly from Tricare, and accept the 
Tricare allowable charge, less any applicable cost-shares paid by you, as 
payment in full for their services.

82
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
 
 There’s no national list of participating providers. You need to ask your 
provider if she participates in the Tricare program. The general rule is, 
if the provider fills out the claims paperwork for you, she’s a participat-
ing provider. If you have to fill out the claim form yourself, she’s a non-
participating provider.
 
✓ Nonparticipating providers: Nonparticipating providers have not 
agreed to accept the Tricare allowable charge for services or file your 
claims. Under the law, nonparticipating providers may charge up to 15 
percent above the Tricare allowable charge for services (in addition to 
your regular cost-shares). This amount is your responsibility and isn’t 
shared by Tricare.
 
 If you see a nonparticipating provider, you may have to pay the provider 
first and file a claim with Tricare for reimbursement. To file a claim, you 
need DD Form 2642, Patient’s Request for Medical Payment. The form is 
available online at www.tricare.mil/mybenefit/Download/Forms/
dd2642.pdf, or you can call 303-676-3400 and ask to have a copy mailed 
to you.
 
You don’t have to enroll in Tricare Standard. You’re enrolled automatically 
the first time you use any benefits and present your military or dependent ID 
card as an insurance card to the provider.
 
Be sure to check with the provider to see if she is a participating or nonpar-
ticipating provider. The doctor may decide to participate on a claim-by-claim 
basis. This means that for one type of service, the provider will participate 
(agree to accept the Tricare allowable charge and file claims on your behalf), 
but for another she won’t. Using a participating provider is your best option if 
you use Tricare Standard.
Tricare for Life: Medicare plus 
Tricare equals free care
Until a few years ago, when a retiree or retiree family member reached 
the age of 65, they were no longer eligible for Tricare. Instead, they were 
expected to receive medical care under the provisions of Medicare. This 
changed in 2001 with the introduction of Tricare for Life.
To remain eligible for Tricare benefits, you must enroll in Medicare Part B. 
This is the Medicare program where you pay monthly premiums ($96.40 in 
2009) in exchange for receiving medical care from authorized Medicare 
providers.
Under Tricare for Life, you receive your medical care from Medicare providers, 
but Tricare becomes a secondary insurer and picks up any costs that Medicare 
doesn’t cover. You pay no annual deductible or cost-share under this program.

83
 Chapter 5: Tricare: The Military’s Health Insurance
Checking Your Tricare Eligibility
More than 9.3 million people are eligible for Tricare. For brevity’s sake, I’m 
limiting the lists here to veterans who are no longer in the military and their 
family members.
As a veteran, you’re eligible for Tricare benefits if you
 
✓ Are a retired active-duty member. See Chapter 7 for information about 
military retirement.
 
✓ Are retired from the reserves or National Guard and are age 60 or older. 
Again, Chapter 7 has more information.
 
✓ Served in the military (for any length of time) and were awarded the 
Medal of Honor, our nation’s highest military award.
If you’re a spouse or dependent of a veteran, you’re entitled to Tricare 
benefits if you are
 
✓ A spouse or child of an eligible veteran (see the preceding list). Children 
include
 
• Unmarried children under the age of 21
 
• Those under the age of 23 if attending college and the parent(s) 
provide at least 50 percent of their support
 
 A child may be covered beyond these limits if he is severely disabled 
and the condition existed prior to his 21st birthday, or if the condition 
occurred between the ages of 21 and 23 while the child was enrolled in 
college.
 
✓ A surviving spouse of a military member who died on active duty. In 
this case, your Tricare benefits expire three years after the death of the 
active-duty member.
 
✓ An ex-spouse of a military member or retiree, if — as of the date of the 
divorce — you were married to the member or veteran for at least 20 
years, and your ex was in the military for at least 20 years of the 
marriage.
 
✓ An ex-spouse of a military member or retiree, if — as of the date of the 
divorce — you were married to the member or veteran for at least 20 
years, and your ex was in the military for at least 15 years, but less 
than 20 years, of the marriage. In this case, your Tricare benefits expire 
one year after the date of the divorce.
 
If you are a surviving spouse or a former spouse and you remarry, you lose 
your Tricare benefits. Unlike many veterans benefits, you do not regain Tricare 
if that subsequent marriage later ends.

84
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Enrolling in DEERS
No, I don’t mean Bambi. In addition to meeting the eligibility criteria outlined 
in the previous section, veterans and family members need to ensure they 
are enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). 
This is the massive computer system that tracks military members, veterans, 
and family members who are eligible for military benefits.
If you’re eligible for Tricare, you’re probably already enrolled in DEERS, but it 
doesn’t hurt to make sure the information is up to date. Mistakes or outdated 
information in the DEERS database can cause problems with Tricare claims.
You can verify and update your DEERS information in several ways:
 
✓ In person: To add or remove family members, or to change your mailing 
address, phone number, or e-mail address, visit a local ID card office. ID 
card offices are located on all military bases.
 
✓ By phone: Call the Defense Manpower Data Center Support Office at 
800-538-9552 to update your mailing address, e-mail address, and phone 
number. You can’t add or remove family members over the phone.
 
✓ By fax: Fax any mailing address, e-mail address, or phone number 
changes to the Defense Manpower Data Center Support Office at 831-
655-8317. To add or remove family members, you have to fax supporting 
documentation (marriage certificate, birth certificate, divorce decree, or 
death certificate).
 
✓ By mail: Mail changes to the Defense Manpower Data Center Support 
Office. You must also mail supporting documentation if you are adding 
or removing a family member. The address is Defense Manpower Data 
Center Support Office, Attn: COA, 400 Gigling Road, Seaside, CA 
93955-6771.
 
✓ Online: Visit the DEERS Web site at https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/
appj/address/index.jsp, and follow the steps to update your 
mailing address, e-mail address, and phone numbers online. You can’t 
add or remove family members online.
Getting Your Medication
Tricare eligible participants have a host of options for getting their meds. 
Depending on which option you select, your medications may be free or 
provided at the ridiculously low cost of $3 per prescription, or they may 
cost you big bucks.

85
 Chapter 5: Tricare: The Military’s Health Insurance
If you get your medications from a military pharmacy, Tricare network phar-
macy, or the mail-order pharmacy, you don’t have to file a reimbursement 
claim. The provider automatically does this for you.
If you get your drugs from a non-network pharmacy, the pharmacy may not 
file a claim on your behalf. In that case, you have to file your own claim for 
reimbursement, using DD Form 2642, Patient’s Request for Medical Payment. 
The form is available online at www.tricare.mil/mybenefit/Download/
Forms/dd2642.pdf, or you can call 303-676-3400 and ask to have a copy 
mailed to you.
Meds on military bases
Picking up your prescriptions from an on-base pharmacy is the best option 
if you live close to a military base. Your prescriptions filled at these pharma-
cies are completely free!
However, your nearby on-base pharmacy may not stock all the medications 
you need. Whether it does depends on the size of the military base, and 
therefore on the size of the military medical facility that supports that base.
 
Military regulations require each on-base military pharmacy to stock medica-
tions that are on a list called the Basic Corps Formula (BCF) listing. Depending 
on the size of the military pharmacy, it may stock medications on the Extended 
Core Formula (ECF) list as well. To see a current listing of medications on both 
lists, visit www.pec.ha.osd.mil/BCF/BCFclass.htm.
Choosing your own pharmacy
You can elect to fill your prescriptions at any civilian pharmacy. If you’re 
smart enough to use one of the 54,000 pharmacies in the Tricare network, 
your prescriptions will only cost you $3 per prescription or refill (up to a 
30-day supply) for generic drugs and $9 for name-brand items.
If you choose to use a commercial pharmacy that isn’t part of the Tricare 
network, be prepared to pay more — possibly a lot more. Additionally, you’ll 
probably have to pay the full amount of your prescription upfront, and then 
file a claim with Tricare to get your covered costs back. Tricare will reim-
burse you $9 or 20 percent of the authorized cost for the medication, which-
ever is greater.

86
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
 
If you’re enrolled in Tricare Prime and elect to use a commercial non-network 
pharmacy (why would you?), there’s an annual deductible of $300 per person 
or $600 per family before you receive any reimbursement. If you use Tricare 
Extra or Tricare Standard for your medical needs and elect to use a non-network 
pharmacy, the annual deductible is part of the Tricare Extra or Standard 
annual deductible.
Mail-order pharmacy: 
The med’s in the mail
Using the mail-order pharmacy is a great option if your medication isn’t 
urgent and you are lazy (I mean “physically conservative”), like me, and don’t 
feel like going down the street to the pharmacy.
You can order your prescription or refill by mail or online, and Tricare’s mail-
order pharmacy will send your meds right to your door. Your cost-share is 
the same as using a Tricare network pharmacy — $3 for a generic drug and 
$9 for name-brand pharmaceuticals. However, you get more bang for your 
buck by using the mail-order service because you can receive a 90-day supply 
for that price, instead of a 30-day supply, with this option.
 
You can enroll in the mail-order pharmacy online at www.express-scripts.
com/custom/dod/ben_message. You can also enroll by going to the Web 
site and printing out the mail-order registration form. Then mail it to Express 
Scripts Inc., P.O. Box 52150, Phoenix, AZ 85072; or fax it to 877-895-1900.
How Much Does All of This Cost?
Your costs under Tricare depend on which Tricare program you elect to par-
ticipate in (see the “Tricare: Pick a Plan, any Plan” section). In the following 
sections, I give you the approximate prices you can expect for each program.
Looking at the plans’ costs side by side
You know you’re eligible for Tricare, and you know you want to use one of 
the plans. But in terms of cost, which one is right for your pocketbook? 
Table 5-1 shows you how the costs line up for Tricare Prime, Extra, and 
Standard. Because Tricare for Life works in conjunction with Medicare, I 
address the costs of that plan in the next section. (If you want to know how 
much you’d pay for prescription drugs, see the “Getting Your Medication” 
section.) Note: The costs for services under Tricare Extra and Tricare Prime 
are what you pay after you’ve met your deductible.

Costs of services under Tricare for Life
Tricare for Life combines Medicare Part B benefits and Tricare benefits. 
Under this program, you pay a Medicare monthly Part B premium, which in 
2009 is $96.40 per month. You must also pay the annual Tricare deductible, 
which is $150 per individual or $300 for a family, but you don’t have to pay 
the Medicare annual deductible.
If you obtain your medical care from an authorized Medicare provider, 
Medicare covers a majority of the costs, and Tricare pays the remainder. The 
result is no additional cost to you. In effect, you’re receiving complete and 
total healthcare coverage for the price of your monthly Medicare Part B pay-
ments and the annual Tricare deductible.
 
There may be instances where a medical service is covered by Medicare but 
not Tricare, or vice versa (although these situations are rare). In such cases, 
if the service is covered by Medicare but not Tricare, you pay the standard 
Medicare co-pays. If the treatment is authorized by Tricare but not Medicare, 
you pay the co-pays listed under Tricare Extra or Tricare Standard, depending 
on whether you’re receiving the treatment from a Tricare network provider.
Catastrophic cap
The maximum amount that you have to pay out-of-pocket per fiscal year 
(October 1–September 30) for Tricare-covered medical services is called the 
catastrophic cap. The cap applies to all covered services: annual deductibles, 
pharmacy co-payments, inpatient and outpatient cost-shares, and other costs 
based on Tricare allowable charges.
After you meet the catastrophic cap, Tricare pays your portion of the Tricare 
allowable amount for all covered services for the rest of the fiscal year. This 
protection keeps you from going into the poorhouse in the event of long-term 
illness or injury.
What Isn’t Covered by Tricare?
Tricare covers most inpatient and outpatient care that’s medically necessary 
and considered proven. However, there are special rules or limits on certain 
types of care, while other types of care aren’t covered at all. Some services or 
treatments require prior authorization.

89
 Chapter 5: Tricare: The Military’s Health Insurance
A few examples of medical procedures that aren’t covered are
 
✓ Abortions (unless the mother’s life is at risk).
 
✓ Condoms. However, other forms of birth control that require a prescrip-
tion, such as birth control pills, are covered.
 
✓ Cosmetic surgery or drugs used for cosmetic purposes (such as Botox). 
However, cosmetic surgery to correct a disfigurement, such as the result 
of an accident or burn, is covered.
 
✓ Nonsurgical treatment for obesity or weight control.
 
✓ Smoking cessation products and treatment.
 
✓ Most dental work. (The military has a separate insurance program for 
dental care — see the “Smiling about Dental Care” section.) However, 
dental care that is medically necessary in the treatment of an otherwise 
covered medical (not dental) condition is covered.
Using Tricare Overseas
The only Tricare program that can be used in foreign countries (by eligible 
veterans and their family members) is Tricare Standard. Tricare Prime can 
be used overseas by current military members and their families, but Tricare 
Prime isn’t available overseas to others. Tricare Extra can’t be used in for-
eign countries because there are no Tricare network providers outside of the 
United States. You can’t use Tricare for Life in non-U.S. states and territories 
overseas because of Medicare restrictions.
Under Tricare Standard, the military pays 75 percent of the authorized cost. 
If the overseas provider charges more than what Tricare authorizes for the 
procedure, you have to pay the difference out of your own pocket.
 
If you’re age 65 or older, you must still enroll in Medicare Part B and pay the 
monthly Medicare premiums to use Tricare Standard overseas.
Smiling about Dental Care
The Tricare Retiree Dental Program (TRDP) is a separate, voluntary coverage 
program available to eligible users of Tricare (see the “Checking Your Tricare 
Eligibility” section earlier in this chapter). Under this program, you pay a 
monthly premium in exchange for dental care benefits, which are managed 
by a company called Delta Dental.

Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
 
If after you read the following sections you decide you want to enroll, go to 
www.trdp.org/pro/index.html. You can get more information about the 
dental program there. You can also enroll by calling 888-838-8737 between 6 
a.m. and 6 p.m. (Pacific time) Monday through Friday.
Counting the costs
The dental program is a separate, voluntary benefit, and it isn’t free. If you 
elect to participate, you pay a monthly premium in exchange for dental 
coverage. How much you pay depends on where you live and the number of 
people in your family that you elect to have covered.
For example, using the 2009 rates, if you live in Daytona Beach, Florida, your 
monthly premium would be $31.46 per person, or $102.55 for a family of 
three or more. If you live the good life in Los Angeles, your monthly premium 
would be $46.46 or $150.83 for a family of three or more. To search for pre-
mium rates where you live, visit www.trdp.org/pro/premiumSrch.html.
Using a desirable dentist
Delta Dental has a listing of more than 100,000 network providers. If you use 
a network provider, the provider files your insurance claims for you and 
doesn’t charge more than the plan’s authorized amount.
You can, of course, use any dentist you want, but your coverage is based on 
the authorized amount. If your non-network dentist charges more than this, 
you’ll have to dig into your pocket to pay the difference. You can find a list of 
Delta Dental network providers online at www.trdp.org/findadentist.

Covering your coverage
Under the Tricare dental program, you have to pay an annual deductible. For 
the TRDP, the deductible is $50 per person with a $150 cap per family. After 
the deductible is met, you receive the coverage shown in Table 5-2.

Using dental benefits overseas
Here’s some good news for military retirees and their family members who 
live overseas. While you and I were sitting around picking our teeth (pun 
intended), your friendly neighborhood Congress critters decided to expand 
retiree dental benefits to those living in foreign countries. How cool is that? 
This expansion of benefits became effective October 1, 2008.
 
You should carefully weigh your options when considering whether to enroll 
in the TRDP overseas. In some cases, you may not get back what you pay into 
it. Generally, the monthly premiums are significantly higher than the amount 
charged for those who live in the United States. For instance, average out-of-
pocket expenses for dental care in the Philippines are generally much less 
than monthly insurance premiums. In some countries, if you’re married to a 
citizen of that country, you may be eligible for national healthcare, which may 
include free dental care. So do a little bit of homework before you enroll.
Looking Into Vision Care
Veterans enrolled in Tricare Prime are allowed one comprehensive eye exam-
ination every two years. Veterans who use Tricare Standard, Tricare Extra, 
and Tricare for Life do not qualify for free or reduced-cost eye examinations.
Regardless of the plan, Tricare only pays for eyeglasses and contacts for the 
following conditions:
 
✓ Infantile glaucoma
 
✓ Keratoconus
 
✓ Dry eyes
 
✓ Irregularities in the shape of the eye
 
✓ Loss of human lens function resulting from eye surgery or congenital 
absence

M
ilitary service is not the safest job in the world. In addition to the 
dangers of combat, military members often travel to corners of the 
world where they can be exposed to all kinds of nasty environments and icky 
germs. Sometimes this results in a lifelong medical condition or disability 
that can interfere with a veteran’s ability to get and hold a good job.
The U.S. government takes care of veterans who have disabilities and medi-
cal conditions that were caused or worsened by military service by providing 
monthly disability compensation. It also takes care of low-income veterans 
who are totally and permanently disabled due to non-service-connected 
medical conditions and disabilities by providing a monthly disability pension. 
Finally, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides a lifelong pension 
to veterans who have earned our nation’s highest military decoration — the 
Medal of Honor. Keep reading for more details.
Checking Your Eligibility for
Disability Compensation
The VA provides monthly disability compensation to certain veterans. To be 
eligible
 
✓ Your disability or medical condition must have been caused or made 
worse by your service in the military, as determined by the VA. The VA 

94
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
makes determinations based on service connection and presumed 
service connection (see the upcoming sections for more on these).
 
✓ You must have a disability or a medical condition that the VA has 
assigned a disability rating to. The amount of monthly tax-free disability 
compensation you can receive is based primarily on the disability rating 
you receive from the VA. The VA rates medical conditions and disabilities 
on a scale of 10 percent to 100 percent in 10-percentage-point intervals (in 
other words, 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent, and so on).
 
✓ You must have either an honorable or general discharge. If you have any 
other kind of a discharge, such as an other than honorable conditions 
(OTHC) or a bad-conduct discharge awarded by a special court-martial, 
then the VA must determine that your discharge wasn’t under dishon-
orable conditions. (You can read about discharge characterizations in 
Chapter 2.)
Establishing the service connection
To qualify for VA disability compensation, the VA must determine that your 
medical condition was caused or aggravated by your military service. Service 
connection for a disability or death can be established through many ways. 
The four most common are
 
✓ The disability or condition was incurred in military service. These 
determinations are usually cut and dry because the evidence should be 
in your military medical records. An example would be if you were shot 
or were wounded by an explosion during combat.
 
✓ The aggravation of a before-service disability during service. This can 
be harder to determine because it precludes prior-service conditions 
that get worse due to the natural progression of the disease or condi-
tion.
 
 For example, if you had mild asthma when you joined the military, and 
then you spent four years of service working behind a desk in Maryland 
during which time your asthma got worse, it’s unlikely that the VA 
would conclude this had anything to do with your military service. On 
the other hand, if you were deployed to Kuwait when all those oil wells 
were on fire, it would be easy for the VA to conclude that your condition 
was aggravated due to your service.
 
 When making a determination, the VA considers the places, types, and 
circumstances of your military service as documented in your service 
records (see Chapter 2 for information about service records). The VA 
gives particular weight to combat duty and other hardships of service.

95
 Chapter 6: Disability Compensation and Pensions 
 
✓ Because of a service-connected disability, a secondary condition has 
occurred. It’s been scientifically proven that some medical conditions 
can cause other medical conditions. For example, it’s medically known 
that individuals who have had an amputation of the leg at or above the 
ankle are prone to develop heart disease. In such cases, the condition 
(heart disease) caused by the service-connected disability (amputation) 
can be rated as a service-connected disability by the VA.
 
✓ Presumption that the disease or disability was incurred in military 
service. In certain cases, the VA can make a presumption that a medical 
condition or disability is service connected. You can read more about 
this in the next section.
 
In all cases, there must be evidence of a current disability.
Making a presumptive service connection
The VA presumes that specific disabilities diagnosed in certain veterans were 
caused by their military service, so it issues a presumptive service-connection 
determination. The VA does this because of the unique circumstances of 
the veteran’s military service. If you fit into one of the following groups and 
are diagnosed with one of the listed conditions, the VA presumes that the 
circumstances of your service caused the condition, and it awards disability 
compensation.
 
✓ Veterans within one year of release from active duty: If you are diag-
nosed with a chronic disease (such as arthritis, diabetes, or hyperten-
sion), the VA can presume the condition is service connected, even in 
the absence of any evidence of service connection.
 
✓ Veterans with ALS: If you served in the Persian Gulf (Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi 
Arabia, or other nearby locations) from August 2, 1990, to July 31, 1991, 
and are diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, otherwise known 
as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, the VA considers that condition to be 
service connected. Additionally, the VA presumes a service connection 
if you served on active duty (anywhere) for 90 or more days and are 
diagnosed with ALS.
 
✓ Former prisoners of war for any length of time: If you were a POW for 
any length of time and are diagnosed with a disability that’s at least 10 
percent disabling for any of the following conditions, your condition is 
considered service connected:
 
• Dysthymic disorder (clinical depression)
 
• Heart disease or hypertensive vascular disease and its complications
 
• Mental health conditions

96
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
 
• The aftereffects of frostbite
 
• Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease)
 
• Stroke and its aftereffects
 
✓ Former prisoners of war for at least 30 days: If you were a POW for at 
least 30 days and are diagnosed with a disability that’s at least 10 per-
cent disabling for any of the following conditions, your condition is con-
sidered service connected:
 
• Avitaminosis (any disease caused by chronic or long-term vitamin 
deficiency)
 
• Beriberi (a nervous system ailment caused by thiamine deficiency)
 
• Pellagra (disease caused by lack of niacin)
 
• Any other nutritional deficiency
 
• Chronic dysentery (severe, bloody diarrhea)
 
• Cirrhosis of the liver
 
• Helminthiasis (infested with worms)
 
• Irritable bowel syndrome
 
• Malnutrition
 
• Peptic ulcer disease
 
• Peripheral neuropathy (numbness of the fingers, toes, hands, or 
feet)
 
✓ Vietnam veterans: If you served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, 
and May 7, 1975, and were exposed to the herbicide known as Agent 
Orange, the VA assumes service connection for the following medical 
conditions:
 
• Peripheral neuropathy (numbness of the fingers, toes, hands, or 
feet) if it manifests within one year of exposure to Agent Orange
 
• Chloracne (acne-like eruption of blackheads and cysts caused by 
over-exposure to chemicals) or other diseases similar to chloracne 
if it manifests within one year of exposure to Agent Orange
 
• Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
 
• Hodgkin’s disease (type of lymphoma cancer)
 
• Multiple myeloma (cancer of plasma cells)
 
• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
 
• Porphyria cutanea tarda (blistering of the skin) if it manifests 
within one year of exposure to Agent Orange
 
• Primary amyloidosis (protein fibers imbedded in tissues and 
organs, causing them harm)

97
 Chapter 6: Disability Compensation and Pensions 
 
• Prostate cancer
 
• Respiratory cancers (lung, bronchus, larynx, trachea)
 
• Soft-tissue sarcomas (cancer of the soft tissues of the body)
 
• Type 2 diabetes
 
✓ Gulf War veterans: If you served in the Persian Gulf and have developed 
any of the following conditions (it must be diagnosed before December 
31, 2011), the VA will assume you have Gulf War Syndrome, which is 
considered to be service connected:
 
• Chronic fatigue syndrome
 
• Fibromyalgia (widespread pain)
 
• Irritable bowel syndrome
 
• Any diagnosed or undiagnosed illness that the secretary of 
Veterans Affairs determines warrants a presumption of service 
connection
 
 At the present time, signs or symptoms of an undiagnosed illness 
include fatigue, skin symptoms, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, 
neurological symptoms, respiratory symptoms, sleep disturbance, 
GI symptoms, cardiovascular symptoms, weight loss, and men-
strual disorders.
 
✓ Other presumptive conditions: The VA may presume a condition is ser-
vice connected in many other situations, based on the date and place of 
military service. The complete list is contained in Title 38 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR), in sections 3.307, 3.308, and 3.309:
 
• Section 3.307 can be read online at www.warms.vba.va.gov/
regs/38CFR/BOOKB/PART3/S3_307.DOC.

Determining your disability rating
The VA has a massive (and I do mean massive!) listing of medical conditions 
and disabilities, along with rules and conditions, and more rules and more 
conditions, and required rules and required conditions that ultimately result 
in the assignment of a disability rating.
To reprint the VA’s entire Schedule for Rating Disabilities, I would need to 
persuade my publisher to print a second volume of this book several hun-
dred pages long. Good thing I invented the Internet a few years ago. You can 

98
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
see the entire list online at www.warms.vba.va.gov/bookc.html. The 
Schedule for Ratings Disabilities can be found in Part 4 of Title 38. (Okay, I 
really didn’t personally invent the Internet, but I would have if somebody else 
hadn’t beaten me to it.)
Employability matters
The ability to overcome a disability varies widely among individuals. The 
VA rating schedule is based primarily on how much the earning capacity is 
reduced due to the disability. The VA doesn’t consider the veteran’s personal 
ability to overcome the disability when it determines employability and com-
pensation.
Sometimes the disability rating schedule calls for a disability rating of less 
than 100 percent disabled, but due to individual circumstances, the VA deter-
mines that the veteran is unemployable. In such cases, the VA may award 
disability compensation equal to 100 percent. This can be done only under 
certain circumstances however. The basic rules are:
 
✓ In the VA’s opinion, the veteran’s service-connected disability must pre-
vent him from landing or keeping a decent-paying job.
 
✓ If a veteran has only one service-connected disability, it must be rated at 
60 percent or more.
 
✓ If a veteran has two or more service-connected disabilities, at least one 
of the disabilities must be rated at 40 percent or more, and the com-
bined disability rating (see the next section) must be at least 70 percent 
or more.
Combined ratings
It’s possible that you could have more than one service-connected medical 
condition or disability, each with its own rating. How does the VA determine 
what your total rating is in such cases? You’d think they would simply add 
the ratings together. But, no — that would be too simple for the government. 
If it were that easy, then anyone could do it.
 
I should probably mention here that, as far as the VA is concerned, you can’t 
be more than 100 percent disabled. That’s true even if you have multiple dis-
abilities, each rated at 100 percent. Remember, the VA rates a disability or 
combination of disabilities based on how it would affect the average person’s 
employability. Someone with a 100 percent disability rating is considered to 
be completely unemployable, and you can’t be more unemployable than that.
The VA uses a chart that, when properly used, results in a combined disability 
rating. I’ve reproduced the VA’s chart in Table 6-1.

99
 Chapter 6: Disability Compensation and Pensions 
The chart may look a bit complicated, but it’s not too hard to follow. To find 
the combined disability rating when multiple ratings are involved, take the 
highest rating and locate it at the top of the chart. Then take the next highest 
rating and locate it on the left side of the chart. Where the two lines intersect 
is the combined disability rating.
If there are more than two disabilities, take the next highest disability rating 
(not including the combined rating) and locate it at the top of the chart. Then 
take the previous combined rating and find it on the left side. Where the 
lines intersect is the combined rating for the three disabilities. You continue 
this process until all the ratings are combined. After you’ve combined all 
the ratings, you round the final result to the nearest multiple of 10. This final 
number is your combined disability rating.

How about an example? Assume you’ve been granted a rating of 10 percent 
for one condition, a rating of 20 percent for another condition, and a rating of 
40 percent for still another disability:
 
1. Take the highest rating (40), and locate it at the top of the chart.
 
2. Take the next highest rating (20), and locate it at the left of the chart.
 
 The lines for these two ratings intersect at a combined rating of 52.
 
3. Now take the final rating (10) and locate it at the top of the chart.

102
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
 
4. Locate the combined rating (52) on the left side.
 
 The combined rating for all three conditions is 57. Rounding to the near-
est multiple of 10 gives you a combined disability rating of 60 percent.
 
Although not depicted in Table 6-1, a disability rating of 10 percent plus a dis-
ability rating of 10 percent equals a combined disability rating of 19 percent.
 
Don’t round to the nearest multiple of 10 until all the disability ratings have 
been combined.
How Much Is Your Disability 
Compensation?
If you have a disability rating awarded by the VA for a service-connected 
condition (see “Determining your disability rating” earlier in the chapter), 
you are eligible for monthly (tax-free) disability compensation from the gov-
ernment. The amount of basic benefits paid ranges from $117 to $2,527 per 
month (2008 rates), depending on how disabled you are.
Unless you’re rated as 10 or 20 percent disabled, you receive even higher 
compensation for dependents (spouse, children, and dependent parents), 
and even more if your spouse is seriously disabled and requires special aid 
and assistance (A/A) in the home.
Figuring monthly rates
Your monthly disability compensation depends primarily on your disability 
rating. For those rated at 30 percent or more, rates increase based on the 
number of dependents you have.
If you’re rated at 10 percent disabled, your 2008 monthly disability rate is $117 
per month. If you’re 20 percent disabled, it’s $230 per month.
If you’re rated as 30 percent disabled or more, the 2008 monthly entitlements 
are shown in Table 6-2 and Table 6-3. Table 6-2 shows the rates for veterans 
who don’t have children, while Table 6-3 displays the rates for veterans with 
children.

As with most veterans benefits, children are considered to be those under the 
age of 18, or under the age of 23 if attending a college or university as a full-
time student. Also included are children who are incapable of self-care if the 
incapability happened before the age of 18 (or 23 if enrolled in school).
 
The rates shown in Tables 6-2 and 6-3 are for the year 2008. The VA adjusts the 
rates on December 1 of each year to account for inflation. For the latest rates, visit 
the VA’s Web site at www.vba.va.gov/bln/21/Rates.

105
 Chapter 6: Disability Compensation and Pensions 
Special monthly compensation
Through special monthly compensation (SMC), the VA can pay additional 
compensation to a veteran who, as a result of military service, incurred the 
loss or loss of use of specific organs or extremities. The additional compensa-
tion can range from $3,145 per month to $7,556 per month (2008 rates). The 
exact amount payable depends on several factors, including the exact medi-
cal condition (or combination of conditions) and number of dependents.
Loss, or loss of use, is described as either an amputation or having no effec-
tive remaining function of an extremity or organ. The disabilities that the VA 
can consider for SMC include:
 
✓ Loss or loss of use of a hand or foot
 
✓ Immobility of a joint or paralysis
 
✓ Loss of sight or an eye (having only light perception)
 
✓ Loss or loss of use of a reproductive organ
 
✓ Complete loss or loss of use of both buttocks
 
✓ Deafness in both ears (having absence of air and bone conduction)
 
✓ Inability to communicate by speech (complete organic aphonia)
 
✓ Loss of a percentage of tissue from a single breast or both breasts from 
mastectomy or radiation treatment
The VA will pay higher rates for combinations of these disabilities, such as 
loss or loss of use of the feet, legs, hands, and arms, in specific monetary 
increments, based on the particular combination of the disabilities. There are 
also higher payments for various combinations of severe deafness with bilat-
eral blindness.
If you have a service-connected disability rated at 100 percent, and you are 
housebound, bedridden, or so helpless that you need the aid and attendance 
of another person, you can also receive SMC.
Current SMC rates can be found on the VA’s Web site at www.vba.va.gov/
bln/21/Rates/comp02.htm.
 
As you read through the charts online, you’ll note that the particular condi-
tions are coded, such as SMC L, SMC N, or SMC L. These correspond to spe-
cific disabilities listed under federal law in United States Code (USC), Title 38, 
Section 1114. You can look up these definitions online at www4.law.cornell.
edu/uscode.

Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Concurrent receipt: Military retired 
pay and disability compensation
It used to be that in order to receive VA disability compensation, a military 
retiree was forced to waive an equivalent amount of her retirement pay. After 
years and years and years of veteran complaints, Congress finally agreed that 
this was a bummer and changed the law in 2004 to allow concurrent receipt. 
Simply put, concurrent receipt means you can receive the full amount of your 
military retired pay (as explained in Chapter 7) and the full amount of any VA 
disability compensation you may be entitled to.
However, veterans didn’t get everything they asked for (when do they?). The 
change only applies to veterans who have service-connected disability rat-
ings of 50 percent or more. Veterans who have disability ratings of less than 
50 percent must still waive an equivalent amount of their military retirement 
pay to receive VA disability compensation
 
Waiving military retirement pay to receive VA disability compensation is a 
good choice because military retirement pay is taxable, while disability com-
pensation is not.
Also, the change hasn’t been fully implemented yet. To save money 
(Congress critters often use that as an excuse), the change is being phased 
in. Each year, the percentage of military retirement pay exempt from concur-
rent receipt restrictions is increased. The phase-in will be complete in 2014, 
when the full amount of military retirement pay will be exempt.
Combat-Related Special Compensation
Veteran lobby groups really hoped that Congress would expand the concur-
rent receipt law (see the preceding section) to include veterans with service-
connected disabilities of less than 50 percent.
But Washington’s waskely wabbits had a different idea. They created a new 
program called Combat-Related Special Compensation, or CRSC. Under this 
program, any veteran with a combat-related disability can be paid a monthly 
special pay that is intended to reduce or eliminate the offset of military 
retirement pay.
 
For the purpose of this program, the individual military service, not the VA, 
decides whether a disability is considered combat related.

107
 Chapter 6: Disability Compensation and Pensions 
You’re eligible for monthly CRSC payments if you receive military retirement 
pay, as explained in Chapter 7, and you have a disability incurred as a direct 
result of
 
✓ Armed conflict (gunshot wounds, Purple Heart, so on)
 
✓ Training that simulates war (exercises, field training, so on)
 
✓ Hazardous duty (flight, diving, parachute duty)
 
✓ An instrumentality of war (combat vehicles, weapons, Agent Orange, so on)
Table 6-4 shows the authorized amounts of monthly CRSC payments for 2008. 
Like VA disability compensation, CRSC payments aren’t subject to income taxes.

CRSC is intended to reduce or eliminate the concurrent receipt restrictions. 
Therefore, the amount of CRSC plus the amount of retirement pay you receive 
can’t exceed the amount of full retirement pay you would be authorized to 
receive if not for the offset.
Updating Your Home to Accommodate 
Your Disability
If you suffered a disability while you were serving, chances are you need to 
make some structural changes to your home. The good news is that the 

108
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
government has put some programs in place to help you. The VA has four 
main grant programs designed to assist disabled veterans with necessary 
home modifications:
 
✓ The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant
 
✓ The Special Home Adaptation (SHA) grant
 
✓ The Temporary Residence Adaption (TRA) grant
 
✓ The Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) grant
To find out how to apply for any of these grants, flip to the “Adaptive housing 
grants” section at the end of the chapter.
Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant
The goal of the Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant Program is to provide 
a barrier-free living environment that gives a disabled veteran a level of inde-
pendent living that he may otherwise not enjoy. This grant is available if you 
have a service-connected disability for any of the following:
 
✓ The loss or loss of use of both legs so that you can’t move without the 
aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair
 
✓ Blindness in both eyes, having only light perception, plus the loss or 
loss of use of one leg
 
✓ The loss or loss of use of one leg together with (1) residuals of organic 
disease or injury, or (2) the loss or loss of use of one arm, which affects 
your balance or movement so that you can’t get around without the aid 
of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair
 
 A residual is doctor-talk for aftereffects. For example, if you had lung 
cancer that was cured by surgery or radiation, your lungs may still have 
scarring, which could affect your ability to breathe. Doctors would call 
this condition a residual of the lung cancer.
 
✓ The loss or loss of use of both arms at or above the elbow
The grant can be used to pay for the construction of an adapted home or 
modification of an existing home to meet your adaptive needs. The SAH grant 
is generally used to create a wheelchair-accessible home. This grant is cur-
rently limited to $60,000.

109
 Chapter 6: Disability Compensation and Pensions 
Special Home Adaptation (SHA) grant
If you are permanently and totally (100 percent) disabled with a service-
connected disability for blindness (vision of no better than 5/200 when cor-
rected with glasses), or you suffer from the anatomical loss or loss of use of 
both hands or arms below the elbow, you may be eligible to receive a Special 
Home Adaptation (SHA) grant of up to $12,000.
This grant is generally used to assist veterans with mobility throughout their 
homes.
Temporary Residence Adaptation 
(TRA) grant
If you’re eligible for SAH or SHA, you can use part of that money to modify a 
family member’s home to fit your needs if you’re temporarily living with her. 
You can use up to $14,000 of the maximum SAH assistance or up to $2,000 of 
the maximum SHA assistance for this purpose.
 
Under current law, the Temporary Residence Adaption (TRA) Grant Program 
ends June 15, 2011. Of course, Congress could decide to extend this deadline 
in future legislation.
Home Improvements and Structural 
Alterations (HISA) grant
The Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) grant is avail-
able to veterans with service-connected disabilities and those with non-
service-connected disabilities. The purpose of the grant is to make any home 
improvement necessary for the continuation of treatment or for disability 
access to the home and bathroom facilities.
To be eligible, a VA doctor must indicate that improvements and structural 
alterations are necessary or appropriate for the effective and economical 
treatment of your disability (see Chapter 4). You can receive up to $4,100 if 
you have a service-connected disability and up to $1,200 if you have a 
non-service-connected disability.

110
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Clothing Allowance: Replacing 
Your Wardrobe
Any veteran who is entitled to receive disability compensation for a service-
connected disability for which he uses prosthetic or orthopedic appliances 
may receive an annual clothing allowance.
The allowance also is available to any veteran whose service-connected skin 
condition requires prescribed medication that damages the veteran’s outer 
garments. The clothing allowance rate as of 2008 is $641 per year.
To find out how to apply for this allowance, flip to the later “Clothing allow-
ance” section.
Looking into VA Pensions
A VA pension is a benefit paid to wartime veterans who have limited or no 
income and are age 65 or older, or if under 65, are permanently and totally 
disabled.
VA disability compensation (see the “How Much Is Your Disability 
Compensation?” section) is payable to veterans who have service-connected 
disabilities that have been rated by the VA to be at least 10 percent disabling 
(see the “Checking Your Eligibility for Disability Compensation” section). You 
can’t receive VA disability compensation for disabilities that aren’t service-
connected.
VA pensions, on the other hand, are payable to many veterans who have at 
least one day of wartime service, even if they don’t have a service-connected 
disability.
Generally, you may be eligible for the VA pension if you meet all the following 
criteria:
 
✓ You were discharged from service under conditions other than 
dishonorable (see Chapter 2 for information about how the VA makes 
this determination).
 
✓ You served at least 90 days of active military service, one day of 
which was during a wartime period. If you entered active duty after 
September 7, 1980, generally you must have served at least 24 months 
or — if you’re a member of the Reserves or National Guard — the full 
period for which called or ordered to active duty.

111
 Chapter 6: Disability Compensation and Pensions 
 
✓ Your countable family income is below a yearly limit set by law (the 
yearly limit on income is set by Congress).
 
✓ You are age 65 or older, or you are permanently and totally disabled, not 
due to your own willful misconduct. The disability doesn’t have to be 
service connected.
To receive a VA pension, you must have an annual household income below 
the limits shown in Table 6-5.

Congress usually changes these limits on December 1 of each year to account 
for inflation. For the current limits, see www.vba.va.gov/bln/21/Rates.
Counting your income
Your countable income includes income received by you or your dependents, 
if any, from most sources. It includes earnings, disability and retirement pay-
ments, interest and dividends, and net income from farming or business.
There is a presumption that all your child’s income is available to or for you. 
However, you can exclude a portion of your child’s income. For 2008, the 
annual exclusion limit is $8,950.
 
Some income is not counted toward the yearly limit. For example, welfare 
benefits, food stamps, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) aren’t counted. 
Additionally, you’re allowed to deduct certain medical and educational 

112
Par t II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
expenses. When you apply for a VA pension (see the “Applying in All the Right 
Places” section), you should include all income and deductions. The VA will 
exclude any income and include all deductions allowed by law when comput-
ing your annual family income.
Receiving payment
Assuming you qualify, your annual pension is the difference between your 
countable family income (after exclusions and deductions) and the income 
limits shown in Table 6-5. This amount is then divided by 12 and rounded 
down to the nearest dollar. This gives you the amount of your monthly 
pension payment. VA pensions are exempt from income taxes.
 
You can’t receive a VA non-service-connected pension and service-
connected disability compensation (see the “How Much Is Your Disability 
Compensation?” section) at the same time. However, if you apply for the pen-
sion and are awarded payments, the VA will pay you whichever benefit is the 
greater amount.
Medal of Honor pensions
Veterans who have earned our nation’s highest military decoration, the 
Medal of Honor, receive a lifelong pension, beginning when they retire or 
separate from the military. This pension is paid in addition to any other 
monetary benefits they may be entitled to, such as military retirement (see 
Chapter 7) or VA disability compensation (see the section “How Much Is 
Your Disability Compensation?”).
The pension rate for 2008 is $1,129 per month. The Medal of Honor pension is 
not subject to income taxes.
 
Congress generally changes this rate on December 1 of each year to account 
for inflation. For the current rates, see www.vba.va.gov/bln/21/Rates/
special1.htm.
Applying in All the Right Places
You guessed it. You can’t get any of the goodies described in this chapter 
without paperwork. Exactly what paperwork, where you get it, and where you 
send it depend on the specific benefit that you’re applying for.

To apply for either VA disability compensation or a VA pension, use VA Form 
21-526, Veteran’s Application for Compensation and/or Pension. If available, 
attach copies of dependency records (marriage and children’s birth certifi-
cates), as well as proof of military service and discharge characterization 
(see Chapter 2).
You can obtain the form from any VA regional office (see Appendix B) or 
download it from the VA’s Web site at www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/
VBA-21-526-ARE.pdf. Return the completed application, along with the 
supporting evidence, to your closest VA office.
Combat-Related Special Compensation
To receive this benefit, you must apply through your individual military ser-
vice. The application is made on DD Form 2860, Claim for Combat-Related 
Special Compensation (CRSC). The form is available at the Military Pay and 
Finance section on any military base, or you can download it online at www.
dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd2860.pdf.
Along with the application, include any documentation that you feel is rel-
evant. Examples of documentation you may want to send include copies of 
the following:
 
✓ Retirement orders
 
✓ 20-year letter or statement of service (for reservists)
 
✓ Relevant pages in your VA or military medical records
 
✓ VA ratings determinations
 
✓ Purple Heart decoration award citations (if applicable)
 
✓ Retirement Form DD Form 214 (see Chapter 2)
The Department of Defense (DOD) guidance doesn’t provide an exhaustive 
list of relevant documentation but instead states that decisions will be made 
on the significance of available documents. Keep in mind that the quality of 
the information is more important than the quantity.
 
Be sure to send copies — not original documents. Original documents won’t 
be returned.

M
ilitary service is a tough life. Sure, it has advantages. You get to travel 
and see the world — lovely garden spots such as Kuwait, Afghanistan, 
Bosnia, and Kosovo. Hours are often long, but on the bright side, the work is 
hard. There’s no overtime pay. You uproot your family every couple of years 
and move to another location. If you lose it and yell at your boss, you not 
only will be fired (discharged), but you could wind up in jail as well. And it 
seems as if someone is always shooting at you. Ah, how I miss it all.
Those who can adjust to this rigorous lifestyle and live it 20 or more years 
are rewarded for the rest of their lives with a monthly military retirement 
check.
Military retirement pay is unlike civilian retirement pay systems. There’s no 
vesting, no matching funds, no interest, and no special retirement accounts. 
A retired military member is subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice 
(UCMJ), that code of laws that applies only to military members. That means, 
for example, that a military retired member can be court-martialed for mis-
conduct committed as a retired member. Additionally, a military member can 
be involuntarily “un-retired” (that is, returned to active duty) for any reason 
that the military feels is appropriate. Other than these minor inconveniences, 
getting a monthly check for the rest of your life is a pretty sweet deal.

116
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Understanding Retainer versus Retired
After you’ve put in so many years of military service, you can retire. However, 
the number of years you have to serve differs between the branches. (As I’m 
sure you’re well aware, nothing’s ever simple with the military.)
If you serve in the Army, Air Force, or Coast Guard, you can retire after 20 
years of military service. After you pick up your retirement orders and have 
that final farewell bash with your buddies, you’re called a retired member.
Of course, the Navy and the Marine Corps have elected to be different. For 
Navy and Marine Corps members, you are considered to be a retired member 
for classification purposes if you are
 
✓ An enlisted member with more than 30 years of service
 
✓ A warrant or commissioned officer with 20 or more years of military 
service
Enlisted Navy and Marine Corps members with less than 30 years of service 
but more than 20 years are transferred to the Fleet Reserve/Fleet Marine 
Corps Reserve, and their pay is referred to as retainer pay.
When an enlisted Navy or Marine Corps member completes 30 years, includ-
ing time on the retired rolls in receipt of retainer pay, the Fleet Reserve 
status is changed to retired status, and he begins receiving retired pay.
Don’t get confused about this. A rose by any other name . . . The law treats 
retired pay and retainer pay exactly the same way. The amount of retainer 
pay you receive is the exact same amount as retired pay.
So why do these two branches insist on calling it “retainer pay” for some of 
their members? Good question! Keep reading for the answer.
Becoming “unretired:” 
Recall to active duty
One of the reasons that the Navy and Marine Corps use the term “retainer” 
for some of their retirees is that they want to emphasize to the member, to 
Congress, and to the general public that the military retirement system is 
different. Members — especially those who have recently retired — can be 
recalled to active duty anytime the service wants them. For this reason, mili-
tary officials often refer to military retirement/retainer pay as “reduced pay 
for reduced services.”

117
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Military Retirement Pay
Younger retirees who are healthy are more likely to be recalled to active duty 
in times of need than older retirees or those with a disability.
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 1352.1 places retirees into one of 
three categories, with Category I the most likely to be recalled during times 
of war, national emergency, or “needs of the service”:
 
✓ Category I: Nondisabled military retirees under age 60 who have been 
retired less than five years.
 
✓ Category II: Nondisabled military retirees under age 60 who have been 
retired five years or more.
 
✓ Category III: Military retirees, age 60 or older, and those retired for 
disability.
Military retired members of any age can be recalled to active duty to face 
court-martial charges. I should emphasize, however, that this doesn’t happen 
very often. In most cases, the military allows the civilian justice system to 
process military retirees who engage in misconduct.
Retirement versus discharge
Another difference between the military retirement program and most civil-
ian retirement systems is that there is no vesting. In other words, it’s all or 
nothing. You either qualify for retirement by honorably serving at least 20 
years in the military, or you do not.
If you’re discharged from the military with 19 years, 11 months, and 27 days 
of service, for example, you don’t qualify for retirement pay (other than a few 
early retirement programs offered during the 1980s and 1990s, which were 
designed to reduce the size of the armed forces).
Additionally, to be entitled to receive retirement pay from the military, your 
service must be characterized as honorable. A general discharge under hon-
orable conditions won’t hack it (see Chapter 2 for information about service 
characterizations).
Figuring Out Your Retirement Pay
Military members receive all kinds of pay, depending on their job, assign-
ment, and other individual factors. As a member of the military, you may 
receive combat pay, subsistence allowance, housing allowance, hazardous 
duty pay, flight pay, jump pay, sea pay, submarine duty pay, and more. When 

118
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
it comes to retirement pay calculation, however, only basic pay counts. 
Everyone in the military receives basic pay. The amount of monthly basic pay 
you receive is based on your rank and how many years of military service 
you have.
In the vast majority of cases, your retirement rank is the same as the rank 
you held at the time you retired. However, if you spent part of your military 
career as a commissioned officer, this may not be the case. To retire in your 
commissioned rank, the law requires that you have at least 10 years of ser-
vice as a commissioned officer.
This won’t affect your retirement pay if you’re under the High 36 program 
(see “The High 36 Retirement Program” later in the chapter) because it’s 
computed using your highest 36 months of basic pay. But if you entered the 
military before September 8, 1980, the amount of time you spent as a commis-
sioned officer could have a significant impact on your retirement pay.
A military member who entered the service prior to September 8, 1980, and 
first enlisted and later became commissioned, but has less than 10 years 
of commissioned service, would retire using the basic pay of the highest 
enlisted rank he held. Because enlisted members generally make much less in 
basic pay than commissioned officers, this could put a serious dent in your 
retirement wallet.
 
Basic pay rates from 1949 to present can be found on the Defense Finance
 and Accounting Web site at www.dfas.mil/militarypay/military
paytables.html.
Retirement pay is calculated differently for those who retire from active 
duty and for those who retire from the National Guard or reserves. That’s 
because folks on active duty serve full time, while those in the Guard and 
Reserves serve a mixture of full-time and part-time duty. Chapter 2 provides 
more information about active-duty vs. Guard/Reserve service. I go into more 
detail on how service time relates to retirement pay later in the chapter.
Calculating active-duty retirement
To retire from active duty you must have at least 20 years of active-duty mili-
tary service. The basic formula to calculate your retirement pay is
Basic Pay × Number of Years Active-Duty Service × 2.5%
Imagine that you’re an E-6 with 20 years of military service, earning a basic 
pay of $3,243.30 per month. Here’s how you’d calculate your retirement pay:
$3,243.30 × 20 years = $64,866
$64,866 × 2.5% = $1,621.65

119
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Military Retirement Pay
Hold on, you’re not done yet. Whether you receive this amount or a slightly 
less averaged amount, casually referred to as “High 3,” depends on when you 
joined the military. You can get all the details on High 3 in the “The High 36 
Retirement Program” section.
Active-duty members begin receiving their retirement pay on the first day 
of the month after their official date of retirement. Unlike active-duty pay, in 
which the monthly earned pay is equally divided between two paydays (the 
1st and the 15th of each month), you receive your retirement pay only on the 
1st of the month. If the 1st falls on a weekend or holiday, you receive your 
monthly retirement pay on the first business day after the 1st.
Computing reserve retirement 
points and pay
The formula used to compute National Guard and Reserve retirement pay is 
the same as for active duty, with one major exception: Because active-duty 
service is full time and Guard/Reserve service is a mixture of part-time and 
full-time duty, you first have to calculate equivalent active-duty time. After all, 
fair is fair, right?
Members of the National Guard and Reserves receive retirement points. At a 
minimum, they’re required to perform one weekend of drill per month, plus 
two weeks of active-duty training per year. Sometimes they spend extra time 
on active duty, such as if they need to attend a military training school or if 
they’re called for deployment.
My, how times have changed
Every year, Congress passes a Defense 
Authorization Act and a Defense Appropriations 
Act, which — among other things — set the 
military basic pay rates for the upcoming year. 
It’s interesting to see how times have changed 
over the years.
My uncle retired from the Army in 1949 in the 
pay grade of E-6 with 20 years of service.
In 1949, an enlisted member in the pay grade of 
E-6 with 20 years of service took home $249.90 
per month in basic pay. A commissioned officer 
in the pay grade of O-6 with 20 years of service 
made $612.75 per month.
In 2008, that same E-6 would have earned 
$3,243.30 per month in basic pay, and the O-6 
would have made a whopping $8,075.10 per 
month.
I retired from the Air Force in 1998 as an E-8 with 
23 years of service. At the time of my retirement, 
my basic pay was $2,873.10 per month. Just in 
case you were wondering.

120
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Guard/Reserve members receive 4 points for each weekend drill and 1 point 
for each day spent on active duty, such as deployments, active duty for train-
ing (ADT) (including the two weeks of training per year), and attending mili-
tary school.
Qualifying years
Like active-duty members, Guard/Reserve individuals must have at least 
20 years of service to qualify for retirement. However, those years must be 
qualifying years. A qualifying year is one in which you earn a minimum of 
50 retirement points.
If you perform the minimum required duty (one weekend per month of drill, 
plus two weeks per year of active-duty training) for a year, you receive a total 
of 62 points, making that a qualifying year for retirement. That actually gives 
you a little buffer zone in case you have to miss a weekend drill or two during 
the year.
60/75 point rule
Can you persuade your commander to let you work every weekend, and 
thereby increase your retirement points for the year? To a point, yes. 
Weekend drill is inactive duty time. That’s an important distinction because 
the law only allows you to accumulate a total of 60 points per year of inactive 
duty time for service prior to 1996, and 75 points per year for duty performed 
after 1996. What a bummer!
 
Full-time duty you spend in military schools and during deployments is active-
duty time, not inactive-duty time, and isn’t subject to the 60/75 point rule. For 
example, if you were deployed to Iraq for a year, you’d earn 365 retirement 
points (366 retirement points if you deployed during a leap year).
Converting points to years
To determine how much retired pay you may be eligible to receive, the first step 
is to calculate the number of equivalent years of service. The formula for com-
puting equivalent years of service for Guard/Reserve retired pay is fairly simple:
Total Number of Retirement Points ÷ 360
The formula computes the number of equivalent years of service the soldier 
has completed (comparable to full-time active-duty service). For example, 
3,600 points equals 10 years of equivalent active-duty service.
The formula to compute your pay is then the same as for active-duty 
retirement pay:
Basic Pay × Number of Years Equivalent Active-Duty Service × 2.5%

121
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Military Retirement Pay
As with active-duty retirement pay, whether you receive this amount or a 
lesser, averaged amount depends on when you first joined the military. See 
the “The High 36 Retirement Program” section.
Knowing when to expect your first check
Members who retire from the National Guard and Reserves don’t receive 
their retirement pay immediately upon retirement. They receive their first 
pay when they reach the age of 60.
That’s the bad news. The good news is that Congress fiddled a little 
with Guard/Reserve retirement in 2008. Under the 2008 National Defense 
Authorization Act, Congress reduced the age for receipt of Guard/Reserve 
retired pay by three months for each 90 days of specified duty performed in 
any fiscal year after January 28, 2008. Specified duty includes active duty for 
deployment to a combat zone and when called to active duty in response to a 
national emergency declared by the president or supported by federal funds. 
Your retired pay eligibility age, however, can’t be reduced below the age of 50.
The High 36 Retirement Program
During the 1980s, Congress decided that military retirement pay benefits 
were too generous, so they did something about it while trimming the fed-
eral budget a bit along the way. Congress enacted a provision, the High 36 
Retirement Program, that could affect the final retirement pay you receive. 
Some folks call this the “High 3” program because 36 months equals 3 years.
If you joined the military before September 8, 1980, you’re not affected by the 
High 36 program. Your retirement pay is your final base pay multiplied by the 
number of years of active-duty service multiplied by 2.5 percent.
On the other hand, if you joined the military on or after September 8, 1980, 
your retirement pay will be reduced significantly under High 36.
Under High 36, instead of using your final base pay in the formula, you use the 
average of your highest 36 months of basic pay. The exact amount of retired 
pay varies with each individual because of pay increase factors during the 
member’s final 36 months of service. For example, military members receive 
a cost of living allowance (COLA) every January, which increases their basic 
pay. Also, their basic pay increases when they have more time-in-service. 
Finally, if they get promoted during their final 36 months of service, that 
increases their basic pay. On average, High 36 retirement pay is about 10 per-
cent less than retirement pay for those who aren’t subject to High 36.

122
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Is it taxable?
I run into civilians all the time who think that my military retirement pay is 
tax free. Not so, folks. Military retirees pay their fair share of the costs of run-
ning our government.
Military retirement pay is subject to federal income tax. The amount 
deducted from your pay for federal withholding tax each month is based 
on the number of exemptions you indicate on your W-4 after retirement. 
Whether your retirement pay is subject to state income tax depends on your 
state’s laws. Some states exempt military retired pay from state income 
taxes. Contact your state’s veterans office (see Appendix B) for more infor-
mation about state taxes and military retirement pay.
 
You can change the amount of tax withheld from your retirement pay each 
month by completing a new W-4 at any time. See “Keeping DFAS Up-to-Date.”
Although military retirement pay is subject to federal income tax, it’s not sub-
ject to FICA (Social Security) deductions.
Medical retirement pay is tax free if you joined the military before September 24, 
1975. It’s also tax free if the military makes a determination that your medical 
condition is combat related.
How retired pay fits with Social Security 
and other money matters
The question I’m probably asked the most from military retirees who have 
not yet reached the age of 65 is, “Will military retired pay affect my Social 
Security benefits?” The answer, thankfully, is no. Your military retirement 
pay isn’t reduced when you receive Social Security, nor are your Social 
Security benefits reduced because you receive military retirement pay.
If you’re receiving disability compensation from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA), your military retirement pay is reduced by the amount of VA 
disability compensation you receive, unless you qualify for an offset because 
your disability rating is 50 percent or more, or you’re eligible for Combat-
Related Special Compensation. Both of these program are explained in 
Chapter 6.
Unlike active-duty and National Guard/Reserve pay, military retired pay can’t 
be garnished for commercial debts (credit cards, automobile loans, and the 
like). Military retirement pay can, however, be garnished for alimony, child 
support, IRS tax levies, and debts owed to the government.

123
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Military Retirement Pay
Also, if you retire from the military and elect to get a federal government job 
(see Chapter 12), you may continue to receive your military retirement pay 
during your federal employment. However, if or when you retire from federal 
civil service, you can waive your future military retired pay to include your 
military service in the computation of your civil service annuity. Depending 
on which of the dozens of civil service retirement programs you fall under, 
this could be a good deal.
 
If you elect to combine your military retirement with your civil service retire-
ment, you no longer qualify for the disability compensation offset or the 
Combat-Related Special Compensation programs explained in Chapter 6.
Taking the bonus
In 2001, Congress made another significant change to the military retirement 
system. The program is called Career Status Bonus (and is commonly referred 
to as Redux). Under Redux, active-duty military members can elect to take a 
lump-sum bonus of $30,000 when they have 15 years of military service, in 
exchange for an agreement to accept a decreased retirement pay amount.
This is a good deal — for the government, not for the veteran. Congress’s 
goal in establishing this program was to save hundreds of millions of dollars 
in future retirement obligations. It works well, but at the veteran’s expense. 
In fact, it could be argued that no payday lender has ever ripped off a military 
member as the government has done with this program.
For a 20-year military career, High 3 provides retirement pay equal to 50 
percent of your average basic pay over your three highest income years (see 
the section “The High 36 Retirement Program” for details). Redux pays only 
40 percent for a 20-year retiree. The percentage gap narrows for each year 
of military service performed past 20 years, so that for 30 years of service, 
both plans pay 75 percent of the average of 36 months of basic pay. But most 
members don’t serve 30-year careers. Redux also includes a cap on annual 
retirement pay cost of living allowances (COLA). See the “Getting a yearly pay 
raise” section.
While other military retirees receive an annual COLA equal to the cost of 
inflation, Redux retirees have their COLA capped by a full percentage point 
below the inflation rate. Redux does provide a one-time catch-up in purchas-
ing power at age 62, but then the capped COLAs continue until death.
Several military and government think tanks have dissected this program 
north and south. Their conclusions? It’s a bad deal. The average loss in 
retirement pay over a normal life span is about $300,000.
Consider a typical enlisted member who takes the $30,000 bonus at 15 years 
of service. The amount received, after taxes, is actually about $25,500. If you 

124
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
retired at 20 years in the pay grade of E-7 at age 38, the lifetime retirement 
loss would be $344,400, or 13 times the value of the bonus.
Look at it this way: If you finance a home for 30 years, you’d typically pay 
the mortgage lender about 21/2 times the loan’s value. However, in accepting 
the Redux bonus, you would be agreeing to pay back 13 times the amount of 
money you “borrowed.” Take my advice: Walk away from this particular bribe.
Getting a yearly pay raise
A military member in the pay grade of E-7 who retired after 20 years of ser-
vice in 1980 earned about $609.60 per month in retirement pay. How would 
you like to try to live on that today?
Fortunately for the retiree in the example, he doesn’t have to. Military retir-
ees receive an annual cost of living adjustment, or COLA, on December 1 of 
each year.
The amount of the COLA is equal to the inflation rate for that year, based on 
the consumer price index (CPI). The purpose of the annual COLA is to help 
retirees maintain the same purchasing power from year to year.
 
If you accepted the Career Status Bonus (also known as Redux), your COLA 
will be capped at one full percentage point below the rate of inflation. See the 
“Taking the bonus” section earlier in this chapter.
Getting a Handle on Medical Retirement
Military service is a dangerous business. Sometimes a serious injury or ill-
ness may interrupt a successful military career. In such cases, military 
medical authorities may decide that medical retirement is appropriate if the 
medical condition is severe enough to interfere with the proper performance 
of your military duties.
Medical evaluation boards
When a military doctor determines that you have a medical condition that 
may interfere with the performance of your military duties, he refers the case 
to a Physical Evaluation Board (PEB). This medical board consists of active-
duty physicians (not personally involved in your medical care) who review 

125
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Military Retirement Pay
the clinical case file and decide whether you should be returned to duty or 
medically separated or retired using the published medical standards for 
continued military service.
 
You can see the list of medical conditions that are generally considered 
incompatible with continued military service online at usmilitary.about.
com/od/theorderlyroom/l/blmedstandards.htm.
The PEB’s recommendations are forwarded to a central medical board that 
uses four factors to determine whether your disposition is fit for duty, sepa-
ration, permanent retirement, or temporary retirement (see the next section 
for more on disposition types):
 
✓ Whether you can perform your military job
 
✓ Your assigned disability rating
 
✓ The stability of your medical condition
 
✓ Years of active-duty service in the case of preexisting conditions
You can appeal the central medical board’s decision, and you’re allowed to 
have legal counsel at these hearings.
The military is required by law to rate your disability using the “Department 
of Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities.” However, DOD 
Instruction 1332.39 allows the military to modify the rating schedule, based 
on conditions that are unique to the military. Ratings can range from 0 to 100 
percent, rising in increments of 10.
 
Don’t confuse disability ratings granted by the military with disability ratings 
awarded by the VA (see Chapter 6). While both the DOD and the VA use the 
“Department of Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities,” not all the 
general policy provisions set forth in the rating schedule apply to the military. 
Consequently, disability ratings may vary between the two. The military rates 
only conditions determined to be physically unfitting, compensating for loss 
of a military career. The VA may rate any service-connected impairment, thus 
compensating for loss of civilian employability.
Types of disposition
Depending on several factors, the central medical board may order that you 
be returned to duty, medically separated without severance pay, medically 
separated with severance pay, permanently medically retired, or temporarily 
medically retired. Here’s the lowdown on each of these:

126
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
 
✓ Fit for duty: The board judges you to be fit for duty when you can rea-
sonably perform the duties of rank and military job. If the board finds 
you to be medically unfit to perform the duties of your current military 
job, it can order medical retraining into a job you are medically qualified 
to perform.
 
✓ Separated without severance pay: Separation without severance benefits 
occurs if your medical condition existed prior to service, wasn’t perma-
nently aggravated by military service, and you have less than eight years 
of active-duty service (or equivalent Guard/Reserve retirement points).
 
 It is also imposed if you suffered your disability while you were absent 
without leave (AWOL) or while engaged in an act of misconduct or will-
ful negligence.
 
✓ Separated with severance pay: Medical separation with severance pay 
occurs if you’re found unfit for duty, have fewer than 20 years of ser-
vice, and the board awards a disability rating of less than 30 percent. 
Disability severance pay equals 2 months of basic pay for each year of 
service not to exceed 12 years of service. You may also be eligible to 
apply for monthly disability compensation from the VA if it determines 
your disability is service connected. See Chapter 6 for details.
 
 If you are approved for disability compensation from the VA, the law 
requires the VA to recoup your military severance pay before paying 
your disability compensation benefits.
 
✓ Permanent medical retirement: Permanent disability retirement occurs 
if you are found unfit, and your disability is determined permanent and 
stable and is rated at a minimum of 30 percent. You may also be eligible 
for VA disability compensation if the VA determines your medical condi-
tion constitutes a service-connected disability. (Chapter 6 provides com-
plete information about VA disability compensation.)
 
 You can also be medically retired if you have 20 or more years of mili-
tary service, regardless of disability rating. For National Guard and 
Reserve members, this means at least 7,200 retirement points. See 
“Computing reserve retirement points and pay” earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Temporary medical retirement: Temporary medical retirement occurs 
if the board finds you are unfit and entitled to permanent medical retire-
ment except that your disability is not stable for rating purposes. Stable 
for rating purposes refers to whether the condition will change within the 
next five years so as to warrant a different disability rating. When this 
happens, you are placed on the temporary disability retirement list (TDRL). 
When on the TDRL, you are subject to medical reevaluation every 18 
months and limited to 5 years max on the TDRL. At the 5-year point, if not 
sooner during a reevaluation, you are removed from the TDRL and either 
found fit and returned to duty, or permanently medically retired.

127
 Chapter 7: Getting Your Military Retirement Pay
Medical retirement pay compensation
For permanent retirement or placement on the TDRL, your compensation is 
based on the higher of two computations: Disability rating × retired pay base; 
or 2.5 × years of service × retired pay base. Veterans on the TDRL receive no 
less than 50 percent of their retired pay base.
 
The computation of your retired pay base depends on when you joined the 
military. If you joined prior to September 8, 1980, retired pay base is computed 
from your military basic pay at the time of medical retirement. For those who 
entered after September 7, 1980, it’s the average of the high 36 months of 
basic pay. See “The High 36 Retirement Program.”
Divorce and Its Effects on 
Military Retirement Pay
If you’re married, I hope you’re living the “happily ever after” part. 
Unfortunately, the military divorce rate is about the same as the U.S. civilian 
divorce rate: about 50 percent.
In 1981, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that military retirement pay couldn’t be 
divided as community property by state divorce courts. When the decision 
was announced, military retirees shouted for joy, while ex-spouses sent up 
cries of protest.
In its decision, however, the court was very clear that division of military 
retired pay wasn’t necessarily unconstitutional, but that current federal laws 
(at the time) prohibited treating military retired pay as joint property.
Once again, Congress came to the rescue. In 1982, Congress passed the 
Uniformed Services Former Spouse Protection Act (USFSPA). This act allows 
state courts to treat disposable retired pay either as property solely of the 
member, or as property of the member and his spouse in accordance with 
the laws of the state court.
Contrary to popular belief, there is no “magic formula” contained in the act 
to determine the appropriate division of retired pay. A state court can divide 
retired pay in any way it chooses (subject to state laws). For example, it 
would be perfectly legal for a court to divide military retired pay fifty-fifty for a 
marriage that only lasted two months (again, subject to the laws of that state). 
A state could also decide to award a majority of the retired pay to the former 
spouse if the state laws allowed such a division. Conversely, a court may also 
choose to treat retired pay as the exclusive property of the military member.

128
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
The myth of a “magic formula” derives from a section of the law that allows 
the DOD to pay the ex-spouse directly, but only under specific circumstances:
 
✓ The ex-spouse must have been married to the military member for a 
period of at least ten years, with at least ten years of the marriage over-
lapping a period of military service creditable to retired pay.
 
✓ Direct payments won’t be made for division of retired pay in excess of 50 
percent. (If there is more than one divorce, it’s first come, first served — 
no more than 50 percent will be paid as division of retired pay. For exam-
ple, if a court awards ex-spouse number one 40 percent of retired pay, 
and another court awards ex-spouse number two 40 percent of retired 
pay, DOD Finance will directly pay ex-spouse number one 40 percent and 
will directly pay ex-spouse number two 10 percent.)
However, these guidelines only restrict when the DOD can pay the ex-spouse 
directly. In other situations, the member receives the retirement pay and 
must directly pay the ex-spouse her share or otherwise face a contempt of 
court charge.
The moral of the story is don’t get divorced. The only ones who get rich are 
the lawyers.
Keeping DFAS Up-to-Date
After you’re retired, you need to keep the Defense Finance and Accounting 
Service (DFAS) informed of any changes in your account, such as change 
of address or number of exemptions you’d like to claim for tax withholding 
purposes.
The toll-free number that may be used for any calls made within the United 
States, including Alaska and Hawaii, is 800-321-1080. The commercial number 
for calls made from outside these areas is 216-522-5955.
All telephone lines are staffed Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 
7:30 p.m. (eastern time).
These telephone numbers can be used for general questions about your 
account and for notifications, such as a change of address. You must sign 
requests that involve monetary changes. Therefore, you can’t make monetary 
changes over the telephone. You can make monetary changes by mail or by 
using DFAS’s secured myPay Web site at mypay.dfas.mil.

Chapter 8
Carrying On: Payments and 
Benefits for Survivors
In This Chapter
▶ Categorizing your life insurance
▶ Paying the bills with pensions and compensation programs
▶ Getting smart about education programs
▶ Staying healthy with VA medical care
L
ife goes on, and — in some cases — so do veterans benefits. Many fed-
eral benefits are available to survivors of certain veterans. For the most 
part, “certain veterans” means those who have died on active duty, died 
as a result of a service-connected medical condition, or have been rated as 
totally and permanently disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
However, that’s not true in all cases, so please read through this chapter to 
see which benefits may be applicable to you.
Veterans benefits for survivors are offered by both the VA and the Department 
of Defense (DOD). They range from life insurance programs to educational 
benefits to monthly compensation to medical care. Some surviving spouses 
can even finance a home through the VA. I touch on all these topics in this 
chapter.
Ensuring the Family Future: Veterans 
Life Insurance Programs
Veterans life insurance programs are valuable benefits offered by the govern-
ment to qualified veterans. The government has established these programs 
because military members and veterans may find it hard to enroll in civilian 
life insurance programs because of the risks of military service and the possi-
bility of service-connected disabilities and medical conditions. Depending on 
your status, you can choose from several programs.

130
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Servicemembers’ Group 
Life Insurance (SGLI)
Members of active duty, the Reserves, and National Guard are automatically 
enrolled in the Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program at the 
maximum coverage, unless they elect (in writing) a reduced amount or no 
coverage at all.
SGLI premiums are currently $0.065 per $1,000 of insurance, regardless of the 
member’s age, up to a maximum of $400,000 worth of coverage. That means 
the full coverage costs $27 per month. That’s quite a deal.
 
SGLI rates are subject to change. Check out www.insurance.va.gov/
sgliSite/SGLI/sgliPremiums.htm for the current rates.
As an added bonus, coverage of $10,000 is also automatically provided for 
dependent children of members insured under SGLI with no premium required.
Unfortunately, in most cases SGLI coverage ends 120 days after release from 
the military. Service members with SGLI coverage have two options upon 
their release from service:
 
✓ They can convert their SGLI coverage to term insurance under the 
Veterans’ Group Life Insurance program (see the “Veterans’ Group Life 
Insurance [VGLI]” section).
 
✓ They can convert to a permanent plan of insurance with a participat-
ing commercial insurance company. For a list of commercial insurance 
companies that work with the VA, see www.insurance.va.gov/
sgliSite/forms/ParticList.htm.
 
As a result of a law passed by Congress in 2005, service members who have an 
SGLI policy and are totally disabled when they separate from service can now 
keep their SGLI coverage for up to two years after separation at no cost.
Traumatic Servicemembers’ Group 
Life Insurance (TSGLI)
All service members and veterans who are enrolled in the Servicemembers’ 
Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program are automatically covered for 
Traumatic Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (TSGLI) and pay a monthly 
premium of $1. TSGLI provides financial assistance to covered members 
during their recovery period from a serious traumatic injury. Coverage 
ranges from $25,000 to $100,000, depending on the nature of the injury. For 
a list of payments, see www.insurance.va.gov/sgliSite/popups/
ScheduleOfLosses.htm.

131
 Chapter 8: Carrying On: Payments and Benefits for Survivors
Coverage ends when the SGLI terminates, which in most cases is 120 days 
after separation from the military. See the “Servicemembers’ Group Life 
Insurance (SGLI)” section.
 
You don’t have to apply for this separate coverage. If you’re enrolled in SGLI, 
you’re enrolled in TSGLI automatically.
 
For a deceased member to be eligible for payment under the TSGLI program, 
he must have suffered a qualifying traumatic injury and survived for at least 
seven full days from the date of the traumatic injury. Insurance proceeds will 
then be paid to the beneficiary named by the member on his SGLI application.
Family Servicemembers’ Group 
Life Insurance (FSGLI)
Family Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (FSGLI) is a program extended 
to the spouses and dependent children of members insured under the SGLI 
program. (See the “Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance [SGLI]” section.)
FSGLI provides a maximum of $100,000 of insurance coverage for spouses, 
not to exceed the amount of SGLI the insured member has, and $10,000 for 
dependent children.
FSGLI is a service member benefit for which the member pays the premium 
and is the beneficiary of the policy. Monthly rates depend on the amount of 
coverage selected and the age of the spouse. See www.insurance.va.gov/
sgliSite/FSGLI/fsgliPremiums.htm for a table of current rates.
FSGLI is only available for family members of those currently in the military. 
To enroll your family members, contact your unit or base personnel office.
Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI)
Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI) is a program of post-separation insur-
ance that allows a veteran to convert his SGLI coverage to renewable term 
insurance. You can convert your SGLI coverage to VGLI upon your discharge 
from the military or within 485 days of discharge. If you convert within 120 
days of separation, you don’t have to show proof of health. However, if you 
wait longer to enroll in VGLI, you’ll need to show evidence of good health.
VGLI coverage is issued in multiples of $10,000 up to $400,000. However, your 
VGLI coverage amount can’t exceed the amount of SGLI you had at the time 
of separation from the military.

132
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Monthly premium rates depend on your age and the amount of coverage you 
elect. Premiums can range from as low as $0.80 per month to a whopping $1,800 
per month. That’s not a typo, folks. A veteran over the age of 75 would have to 
pay $1,800 per month for the maximum coverage under VGLI. For this reason, 
many veterans don’t consider VGLI to be such a good deal, unless you plan on 
dying soon after you get out of the military. For a list of current premium rates, 
see www.insurance.va.gov/sgliSite/VGLI/VGLI%20rates.htm.
You can apply for VGLI coverage at the time of your military discharge through 
your unit or base personnel office, or online at giosgli.prudential.com/
osgli/web/OSGLIMenu.html.
 
Although VGLI may not be the best choice for most veterans, it’s a very valu-
able benefit for those who are medically discharged or retired from the mili-
tary due to a potentially life-threatening condition, because most civilian life 
insurance plans won’t cover such pre-existing conditions.
Service-Disabled Veterans’ 
Insurance (S-DVI)
Service-Disabled Veterans’ Insurance (S-DVI) is designed specifically for 
veterans with service-connected disabilities. (See Chapter 6 for information 
about service-connected disabilities and disability ratings.) S-DVI is available 
as term insurance and in a variety of permanent plans as well. The maximum 
amount of coverage is $10,000.
You can apply for S-DVI if you meet the following four criteria:
 
✓ You were released from active duty on or after April 25, 1951, with a 
discharge that the VA considers to be other than dishonorable. (See 
Chapter 2 for information about discharge characterizations.)
 
✓ You were rated for a service-connected disability.
 
✓ You are in good health except for any service-connected conditions.
 
✓ You apply within two years from the date the VA grants your service-
connected disability.
Monthly premiums depend on your age, the amount of coverage you elect, 
and the specific insurance plan you choose. You can review the current rates 
at www.insurance.va.gov/inForceGliSite/forms/29-9.pdf.
If you’re eligible, you can apply for S-DVI by completing a VA Form 29-4364, 
Application for Service-Disabled Veterans Life Insurance. You can obtain this 
form from any VA regional office (see Appendix B for locations). You can also 
download the form from the VA’s Web site at www.insurance.va.gov/
inForceGliSite/forms/29-4364.pdf.

133
 Chapter 8: Carrying On: Payments and Benefits for Survivors
Veterans’ Mortgage Life 
Insurance (VMLI)
Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI) is a life insurance program 
designed to pay off the home mortgages of severely disabled veterans in the 
event of their death.
Only veterans who have received a Specially Adapted Housing Grant from the 
VA are eligible for VMLI. This grant helps a disabled veteran build or modify a 
home to accommodate his disabilities. Chapter 6 has more information about 
this program.
The amount of VMLI coverage equals the amount of the outstanding mort-
gage balance still owed by the veteran or $90,000, whichever is the lesser 
amount. VMLI is term insurance that decreases as the mortgage balance is 
reduced by regular payments.
Premiums are based on age, the outstanding balance of the mortgage at the 
time of application, and the number of years remaining on the mortgage. 
The VA has an online premium calculator at insurance.va.gov/inForce
GliSite/VMLICalc/VMLICalc.asp.
If you’re an eligible veteran (that is, you’ve received a Specially Adapted 
Housing Grant from the VA), you can apply for this insurance program 
by completing VA Form 29-8636, Application for Veterans’ Mortgage Life 
Insurance. You can obtain this form at any VA regional office (see Appendix 
B), or online at www.insurance.va.gov/inForceGliSite/forms/
29-8636.pdf.
Survivor Benefit Program (SBP)
The Department of Defense (DOD), not the VA, manages the Survivor Benefit 
Program (SBP). When a retired member of the military dies, his retirement pay 
stops. (See Chapter 7 for information about the military retirement program.)
At the time of retirement, military members can enroll in the Survivor Benefit 
Program. Under this program, a retiree forfeits 6.5 percent of “covered” 
retirement pay each month in premiums. In return, when the retiree dies, the 
surviving spouse or minor children get an annuity equal to 55 percent of the 
covered retirement pay.
You can elect to have any portion, up to 100 percent of your military retired 
pay, covered under SBP. Assume your military retirement pay is $2,000 per 
month. If you want, you can cover 100 percent of that, meaning you would 
have 6.5 percent of the entire $2,000 ($130) deducted from your retirement 
pay each month, and your spouse or children would receive 55 percent of 

134
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
the $2,000 ($1,100) per month upon your death. On the other hand, you could 
elect to cover only 50 percent of your retired pay under SBP. In that case, 
your retired pay would be reduced by 6.5 percent of that $1,000 amount 
($65), but your family would only receive 55 percent of $1,000, or $550 per 
month, upon your demise.
At the time you out-process from the military for retirement, you must sign 
a form either accepting or declining the SBP option (your friendly neighbor-
hood military personnel clerk will make sure you do so).
 
If you are married and you decline SBP, your spouse must also sign, agreeing 
to the declination. Otherwise, you’ll be automatically enrolled in the SBP.
 
If your spouse remarries before age 55, SBP payments stop. However, if the 
remarriage ends, SBP payments can be reestablished.
 
Under the law, SBP payments are reduced by any amount of Dependency 
and Indemnity Compensation received (see the “Dependency and Indemnity 
Compensation [DIC]” section of this chapter). Many members of Congress 
want to eliminate this offset. However, even Congress critters don’t always get 
everything they want. Some members tried to eliminate the offset in 2007 but 
accepted a compromise instead. As part of the 2008 Defense Authorization Act, 
a new payment called “Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance” was created.
The VA pays $50 a month to a surviving spouse who is eligible for both 
DIC and SBP. The $50 allowance is set to increase by $10 a year on October 
1 each year through 2012 — and then cease on February 28, 2016, unless 
Congress takes action to make the allowance permanent or to eliminate the 
offset altogether.
Filing a life insurance claim
Claims for veterans life insurance programs are filed with the VA. You file a 
claim for SBP with the DOD.
Veterans life insurance claims
To file a death claim for a veterans life insurance program, you need to com-

Understanding Death Pensions
The VA will pay a death pension to a spouse who has not remarried or to an 
unmarried child of a deceased wartime veteran. This is a needs-based benefit 
and is payable only to eligible dependents who have annual income below a 
yearly limit set by law.
You may be eligible to receive a VA death pension if all the following condi-
tions are met:
 
✓ You are the unmarried spouse or unmarried child of a deceased veteran. 
To be eligible, a child must be under the age of 18, be in school and 
under 23, or have been incapable of self support before the age of 18.
 
✓ You have an annual “countable income” less than the limit set by law 
(see the next two sections for more on countable income).
 
✓ The deceased veteran served at least one day during a period of war. 
For the purposes of this benefit, periods of war include:
 
• World War I: April 6, 1917, through July 2, 1921
 
• World War II: December 7, 1941, through December 31, 1946
 
• Korean conflict: June 27, 1950, through January 31, 1955
 
• Vietnam era: The period beginning February 28, 1961, and ending 
May 7, 1975, for service within Vietnam, and August 5, 1964, 
through May 7, 1975, in all other cases
 
• Persian Gulf War: August 2, 1990, through a date yet to be 
determined
 
✓ The deceased veteran joined the military on or before September 7, 
1980, and served on active duty for at least 90 days, or joined the mili-
tary after September 7, 1980, and served on active duty for at least 24 
months or (for National Guard and Reserve members) for the full period 
called to active duty.
 
✓ The deceased veteran was discharged from the military with a discharge 
characterization that the VA does not consider dishonorable (see 
Chapter 2 for information about military discharge characterizations).

136
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
To apply for the VA death pension, you need to complete VA Form 21-534, 
Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, Death Pension 
and Accrued Benefits by Surviving Spouse or Child. The form is available 
at any VA regional office (see Appendix B) or online at www.vba.va.gov/
pubs/forms/VBA-21-534-ARE.pdf.
Mail the completed form to the VA regional office which has responsibility for 
the state in which you live. Appendix B lists the addresses. If available, attach 
copies of dependency records (marriage or children’s birth certificates).
Checking the rates and income limits
To be eligible, the surviving spouse or dependent child must have countable 
income less than that prescribed by Congress (the “Deciphering your count-
able income” section lists what is and isn’t considered countable). Table 8-1 
shows the income limits for 2008. The VA pays you the difference between 
your countable income and the yearly income limit for your situation. This 
difference is generally paid in 12 equal monthly payments rounded down to 
the nearest dollar.
Table 8-1 
Annual Death Pension Income Limits for 2008
If You Are a . . .
Your Yearly Income 
Must Be Less Than . . .
Surviving spouse with no dependent children
$7,498
Surviving spouse with one dependent child
$9,815
Housebound surviving spouse with no dependents

Housebound surviving spouse with one dependent
$11,478
Surviving spouse who needs aid and attendance with

Surviving spouse who needs aid and attendance with 
one dependent
$14,298
Surviving child (no eligible parent)
$1,909
Note: For each additional child
Add $1,909 to the limit
For example, using the rates shown in Table 8-1, a surviving spouse with 
one child with a countable annual income of $3,000 would be paid an annual 
death pension of $6,815, or $567 per month.
Congress generally changes the annual income limits once a year to account 
for inflation. For the latest rates, visit www.vba.va.gov/bln/21/Rates/
pen02.htm.

137
 Chapter 8: Carrying On: Payments and Benefits for Survivors
Deciphering your countable income
Countable income includes income received from most sources by the 
surviving spouse and any eligible children. It includes earnings, disability 
and retirement payments, Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), 
Survivor Benefit Program (SBP) payments, interest and dividends, and net 
income from farming or business. Also, the VA presumes that all of a child’s 
income is available to or for the surviving spouse. The VA may grant an 
exception in hardship cases.
Watch out for exclusions and deductions
Some income doesn’t count when computing your countable income, and 
some expenses may be deducted.
Examples of noncountable income include public assistance, such as 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI), food stamps, or welfare. Deductions that 
you may take to decrease your countable income include medical expenses, 
final expenses relating to the deceased veteran’s last illness paid by the sur-
vivor, burial expenses paid by the survivor, and certain educational expenses 
for the surviving spouse and children.
Examining your net worth
Net worth means the net value of the assets of the surviving spouse and her 
children. It includes such assets as bank accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual 
funds, and any property other than the surviving spouse’s residence.
There is no set limit on how much net worth you can have for this benefit, 
but under the law, net worth can’t be excessive. The VA makes this determi-
nation on a case-by-case basis. When making this decision, the VA decides 
whether your assets are sufficiently large that you could live off them for a 
reasonable period of time. Remember, the death pension is a needs-based 
program, and it’s not intended to protect substantial assets or build up an 
estate for the benefit of heirs.
Dependency and Indemnity 
Compensation (DIC)
Dependency Indemnity Compensation, or DIC, is a monthly benefit paid to eli-
gible survivors — the spouse, unmarried child, and in some cases, parent — 
of certain deceased veterans.

138
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
The deceased veteran must meet one of the following criteria:
 
✓ A veteran who died on active duty
 
✓ A veteran whose death resulted from a service-related injury or disease
 
✓ A veteran whose death resulted from a non-service-related injury or dis-
ease, and who was receiving, or was entitled to receive, VA compensa-
tion for a service-connected disability that was rated as totally disabling 
(this includes veterans who were receiving 100 percent disability com-
pensation due to “unemployability,” as explained in Chapter 6)
 
• For at least 10 years immediately before death
 
• Since the veteran’s release from active duty and for at least five 
years immediately preceding death
 
• For at least one year before death if the veteran was a former pris-
oner of war who died after September 30, 1999
Eligible spouses include those who meet one of the following conditions:
 
✓ Married the veteran before January 1, 1957
 
✓ Was married to a service member who died on active duty
 
✓ Married the veteran within 15 years of discharge from the period of 
military service in which the disease or injury that caused the veteran’s 
death began or was aggravated
 
✓ Was married to the veteran for at least one year
 
✓ Had a child with the veteran and lived with the veteran continuously until 
the veteran’s death or, if separated, was not at fault for the separation
 
Spouses who remarry before the age of 57 lose their entitlement to benefits, 
unless that marriage ends. However, due to a change in the law, this doesn’t 
apply to those who remarry on or after December 16, 2003.
If there is no eligible spouse, surviving children of the deceased veteran 
are eligible for DIC in their own right. Eligible children include unmarried 
children under the age of 18, or age 23 if attending school. Also eligible are 
unmarried children who became physically or mentally incapable of self-care 
before age 18.
Surviving parents with low incomes may be eligible to receive DIC payments. 
The term parent includes biological, adoptive, and foster parents. A foster 
parent is a person who stood in the relationship of a parent to the veteran for 
at least one year before the veteran’s last entry into active duty.

139
 Chapter 8: Carrying On: Payments and Benefits for Survivors
Like the death pension benefit, this program is needs-based, and only parents 
with a countable income less than the limit established by law are eligible. 
(See the “Understanding Death Pensions” section of this chapter for an expla-
nation of countable income.)
Payment rates and income limits for DIC
DIC payment rates depend on several factors, the most significant being 
when the veteran died. The 2008 basic monthly rate for surviving spouses of 
eligible veterans who died on or after January 1, 1993, is $1,091. The rate is 
increased for each dependent child, and also if the surviving spouse is house-
bound or in need of aid and attendance. See Table 8-2 for 2008 rates.

2008 DIC Rates for Veterans Who Died 
 
on or after January 1, 1993
If You Are a . . .
Monthly DIC Rate Is

Surviving spouse who needs aid and attendance

$1,362
Surviving spouse who needs aid and attendance

$1,633
Note: For each additional qualifying child
Add $271
In addition to the rates shown in Table 8-2, the VA pays a transitional benefit 
of $250 to the surviving spouse’s monthly DIC if there are children under age 
18. The amount is based on a family unit, not on the number of children.
An additional allowance of $233 per month is also paid if, at the time of death, 
the veteran was entitled to receive 100 percent disability compensation for 
a service-connected disability (including a rating based on individual unem-
ployability) for a continuous period of at least eight years immediately pre-
ceding death and the surviving spouse was married to the veteran for those 
same eight years. (See Chapter 6 for information about the VA disability com-
pensation program.)

140
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
When there is no surviving spouse, eligible children are entitled to DIC, pay-
able in equal shares, at the following monthly rates divided by the number of 
children:
 
✓ One child, $462
 
✓ Two children, $663
 
✓ Three children, $865
 
✓ More than three children, $865, plus $165 for each child in excess of 
three
DIC rates for veterans who died before January 1, 1993, vary according to 
the military rank the veteran held at the time of discharge from the military. 
Current rates can be found on the VA’s Web site at www.vba.va.gov/
bln/21/Rates/comp03.htm.
The DIC is a needs-based program, and a veteran’s parents are eligible only 
if their annual income is below established levels. Monthly DIC rates depend 
on the parents’ annual countable income. Current rates can be read online at 
www.vba.va.gov/bln/21/Rates/comp04.htm.
For 2008 the income limits are
 
✓ Sole surviving parent unmarried or remarried living with spouse: $7,449
 
✓ One of two parents not living with spouse: $5,649
 
✓ One of two parents living with spouse or other parent: $6,362
Applying for DIC
The magic wand for applying for DIC is VA Form 21-534, Application for 
Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, Death Pension and Accrued 
Benefits by Surviving Spouse or Child. You can pick up this form at any VA 
regional office (see Appendix B) or download it from the VA’s Web site at 
www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-534-ARE.pdf.
Mail the completed form to the VA regional office that has responsibility for 
the state where you live. Appendix B has addresses for all VA regional offices.
Making Use of Education Benefits
Survivors’ & Dependents’ Educational Assistance is an education benefit for 
eligible spouses and children of certain veterans. Unlike most other benefits 
in this chapter, the veteran does not have to be deceased for dependents to 
take advantage of the VA’s generosity.

141
 Chapter 8: Carrying On: Payments and Benefits for Survivors
Eligible persons can receive up to 45 months of full-time or equivalent 
benefits for
 
✓ College, business, technical, or vocational courses; high school diploma 
or GED; independent study; or distance learning courses
 
✓ Correspondence courses (spouses only); apprenticeship/on-the-job 
training
 
✓ Remedial, deficiency, and refresher training (in some cases)
 
✓ The cost of tests for licenses or certifications needed to get, keep, or 
advance in a job
To be eligible for this education program, you must be the son, daughter, or 
spouse of
 
✓ A veteran who is rated by the VA with a 100 percent service-connected 
disability. (See Chapter 6 for information about disability ratings and 
service-connection.)
 
✓ A veteran who died from any cause while such a service-connected dis-
ability was in existence.
 
✓ A service member missing in action or captured in the line of duty by a 
hostile force.
 
✓ A service member forcibly detained or interned in the line of duty by a 
foreign government or power.
 
✓ A service member who is hospitalized or receiving outpatient treatment 
for a service-connected, 100 percent permanent disability and is likely to 
be discharged for that disability.
After finding a program approved for VA training, complete VA Form 22-5490, 
Application for Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance. The form 
is available at VA regional offices (see Appendix B) and online at www.vba.
va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-5490-ARE.pdf.
You should submit the form to the VA regional office that serves the state 
where you will train. Appendix B has the addresses.
How much does the VA pay?
The amount the VA pays is based on the type of training program and train-
ing time (full time, half time, so on). This program works much like the 
military GI Bill explained in Chapter 10. You receive 45 months of full-time 
benefits. If you go to school half time, you receive 90 months of half-time 
benefits, and so on. Tables 8-3 through 8-5 show the education rates, effective 
October 1, 2008, depending on the type of training.

 Chapter 8: Carrying On: Payments and Benefits for Survivors
Expiration of benefits
Spouses and surviving spouses have ten years from the date VA establishes 
eligibility to use the benefit. Surviving spouses of veterans who died while 
on active duty have 20 years from the date of the veteran’s death to use the 
benefit.
Children may use the benefit while they are between the ages of 18 and 26.
VA Medical Care for Your Family
Family members of certain veterans may be eligible for a medical insur-
ance program managed by the VA. The program is called the Civilian Health 
and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Because that’s a 
mouthful, it is generally just referred to as CHAMPVA.
CHAMPVA works a whole lot like Medicare. After you’re enrolled, you pay an 
annual deductible and a co-pay for medical care you obtain.
In general, the CHAMPVA program covers most healthcare services and 
supplies that are medically and psychologically necessary. Though not a 
complete list, the program covers ambulance, ambulatory surgery, durable 
medical equipment (DME), family planning and maternity, hospice, inpatient 
services, mental health services, outpatient services, pharmacy, skilled nurs-
ing care, and transplants.
The program doesn’t cover all medical procedures. Remember, the VA must 
consider the treatment to be medically or psychologically necessary. A few 
examples of non-covered services are most dental work, private hospital 
rooms, abortion counseling, cosmetic surgery, cosmetic drugs, artificial 
insemination, custodial care (such as bathing and feeding), routine eye and 
hearing examinations, eyeglasses and contact lenses, hypnosis, and pre-
employment physicals.
 
Long-term care is not a covered CHAMPVA benefit. Long-term care is also 
known as custodial care and is usually provided in nursing homes, assisted-
living facilities, or adult day care, or at a patient’s home. It involves assistance 
with activities of daily living or supervision of someone who is cognitively 
impaired. Because CHAMPVA doesn’t cover custodial long-term care and it can 
be very expensive, you should consider obtaining long-term-care insurance.

144
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
To be eligible for CHAMPVA, you must be in one of these categories:
 
✓ The spouse or child of a veteran who has been rated as permanently 100 
percent disabled for a service-connected disability (see Chapter 6)
 
✓ The surviving spouse or child of a veteran who died from a VA-rated 
service-connected disability
 
✓ The surviving spouse or child of a veteran who was at the time of death 
rated permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected disability
 
✓ The surviving spouse or child of a military member who died in the line 
of duty, not due to misconduct
Eligible children include those unmarried children who are under the age of 
18, or age 23 if attending school, and those who became mentally or physi-
cally incapable of self-care prior to age 18.
As with most survivor benefits, surviving spouses who remarry before age 55 
lose eligibility for this benefit. However, if the new marriage ends, you may 
reestablish eligibility.
 
If you’re eligible for Tricare, the medical program for military retirees and 
their family members, you’re not eligible for CHAMPVA. For details about 
Tricare, see Chapter 5.
If you are eligible for Medicare (age 65 or older), you must enroll in Medicare 
Part B (where you pay monthly premiums) to remain eligible to participate 
in CHAMPVA. Medicare then becomes your primary insurer, and CHAMPVA 
picks up any costs that Medicare doesn’t pay for.
If you meet the eligibility criteria, you can enroll in CHAMPVA by complet-
ing VA Form 10-10d, Application for CHAMPVA Benefits. The form can be 
obtained from any VA regional office (see Appendix B) or downloaded online 
at www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/vha-10-10d-fill.pdf.
Deductibles and co-pay
CHAMPVA is an excellent healthcare program, but it’s not free. Like 
Medicare, there is an annual deductible, and you pay a co-pay for any medi-
cal treatment you receive. The annual deductible is $50 per family member, 
not to exceed $100 for an entire family.
 
There is no deductible for inpatient services, ambulatory surgery facility ser-
vices, partial psychiatric day programs, hospice services, or services provided 
by VA medical facilities.

145
 Chapter 8: Carrying On: Payments and Benefits for Survivors
After the annual deductible has been paid, the VA will pay 75 percent of the 
“allowable cost” for the medical treatment. You pay a co-pay of 25 percent. 
The VA sets a maximum amount for each type of medical treatment covered 
under CHAMPVA. Some medical providers agree not to charge more than 
the allowable cost, and other medical providers charge whatever the market 
will bear. If you use one of the latter providers, the VA pays 75 percent of the 
allowable amount, and you pay the remainder of the bill. More about this in 
the “Understanding how medical providers work with CHAMPVA” section.
To provide financial protection against the impact of a long-term illness 
or serious injury, the VA has established an annual limit for out-of-pocket 
expenses for covered services paid by you. This is the maximum out-of-pocket 
expense you and your family can incur for CHAMPVA-covered services and 
supplies in a calendar year. Upon meeting the limit, you or your family’s 
co-pay for covered services for the remainder of the calendar year is waived, 
and the VA pays 100 percent of the CHAMPVA allowable amount for covered 
services for the remainder of the calendar year.
Understanding how medical providers 
work with CHAMPVA
When you are accepted for enrollment in CHAMPVA, you receive a CHAMPVA 
insurance card. This is your passport to CHAMPVA medical benefits. When 
you obtain medical care, you present this card to the provider you’re seeing. 
What happens next depends on the type of medical provider you’re using.
You have three options: You can obtain medical care from a provider who 
agrees to accept CHAMPVA assignments; you can obtain care from any other 
provider; or you can (in some cases) receive care from a VA medical facility.
CHAMPVA assignments
When you go to a medical provider, find out if the provider accepts 
CHAMPVA. Providers most often refer to it as accepting assignment. What that 
means is the provider will bill CHAMPVA directly for covered services, items, 
and supplies. They do all the paperwork and submit the claim for you. What’s 
even better is that doctors or providers who agree to accept assignment are 
agreeing to accept the CHAMPVA allowable amount and can’t charge more 
than that amount for the services provided to you.
Unfortunately, the VA doesn’t maintain a network of providers who have 
agreed to accept CHAMPVA assignments. However, most Medicare provid-
ers also accept CHAMPVA. Also, most Tricare (the military retiree health-
care system) providers also accept CHAMPVA assignments. You can find 

146
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Medicare providers on the Medicare Web site at www.medicare.gov/
Physician/Search/chooseprovider.asp. See Chapter 5 for information 
about locating a Tricare provider.
Other providers
If assignment isn’t accepted, you can still see the medical provider. But 
if you do, you will likely have to pay the entire charge at the time of ser-
vice. Additionally, you may be charged more than the CHAMPVA allowable 
amount. To obtain reimbursement, you’ll have to submit the itemized bill 
from the provider with a CHAMPVA claim form (see the “Submitting claims” 
section). When the claim is processed, the VA will send you 75 percent of the 
allowable amount. So when the medical provider doesn’t accept assignment, 
your cost will be not only for your share of the CHAMPVA allowable amount 
but also for any charges over your allowable amount.
VA medical facilities
Many VA medical centers (VAMCs) participate in a program called the 
CHAMPVA Inhouse Treatment Initiative, or CITI (pronounced “city”) for short. 
Depending on the CITI programs a VAMC has available, you may be able to 
receive all or a portion of your medical care through the CITI program. The 
care may include inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, durable medical equip-
ment, and mental health services. Over half of all VA medical facilities partici-
pate in the CITI program, so there’s a good chance that a VAMC near you is a 
participant. See Appendix C for addresses and phone numbers for VA medi-
cal centers.
Covering your medication
CHAMPVA also covers medication prescribed by your doctor. The catch is, 
however, that to use the CHAMPVA pharmacy program, you can’t have any 
other type of medical insurance (including Medicare Part D) that provides 
for pharmacy coverage. If you are enrolled in CHAMPVA and don’t have such 
additional insurance, you have three options: VA network pharmacies, non-
network pharmacies, or the Meds by Mail program.
 
You may find this information very similar to the Tricare pharmacy program 
explained in Chapter 5. They are similar because Congress designed this pro-
gram using the Tricare system as a model. However, don’t confuse the two. 
The Tricare program is managed by the Department of Defense (DOD), while 
this program is managed by the VA. Although they’re similar, they are sepa-
rate programs with separate pharmacies, contacts, and required forms.

147
 Chapter 8: Carrying On: Payments and Benefits for Survivors
VA network pharmacies
The VA maintains a network of more than 45,000 pharmacies. It does this 
through a contract with a pharmacy network company called SXC Health 
Solutions Inc. If you don’t have another health insurance plan that includes 
pharmacy coverage and you’re enrolled in CHAMPVA, you can use this net-
work of pharmacies. You only pay your co-pay for the medication (after your 
outpatient deductible has been met), and there are no claims for you to file.
You can find out if a pharmacy near you is a network provider by calling 
800-880-1377. You can also search for network providers near you on the 
SXC Health Solutions Web site at https://vahac.rxportal.sxc.com/
rxclaim/VAH/index.html.
Non-network pharmacies
You can choose any pharmacy. The CHAMPVA insurance card is your proof 
of coverage, but you need to tell the pharmacy that CHAMPVA currently 
doesn’t have a special drug coverage card for prescriptions. When using 
a pharmacy that’s not part of the network, the pharmacy most likely will 
ask you to pay the full amount of the prescription. In that case, you need 
to request reimbursement from the VA by submitting a claim form (see the 
“Submitting claims” section) along with an itemized pharmacy statement.
Meds by Mail
This is by far the most cost-effective way for you to receive your non-urgent, 
maintenance medications if you’re enrolled in CHAMPVA and don’t have 
another health insurance plan with pharmacy coverage (to include Medicare 
Part D). There are no co-payments, no deductible requirements, and no 
claims to file. Your medication is free and is mailed to your home. The disad-
vantage is that, being a mail program, it’s not very fast, so it’s not suitable for 
use for urgent medications. You can still use your local pharmacy for urgent 
care medications.
To begin using Meds by Mail, fill out the Meds by Mail Order Form and 
Patient Profile form available by visiting the VA Web site at www.va.gov/
hac/forms/forms.asp. You can also call 800-733-8387 and select the self-
service option to request that forms be mailed to you.
Submitting claims
To submit a claim for reimbursement for medical services under CHAMPVA, 
use VA Form 10-7959a, CHAMPVA Claim Form, which is available online at 
www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/vha-10-7959a-fill_061507.pdf. 

148
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
You can also request a copy of the form to be mailed to you by calling 800-
733-8387. When submitting your claim, make sure you include an itemized bill 
for services received. Mail the completed form to VA Health Administration 
Center, CHAMPVA, P.O. Box 65024, Denver, CO 80206-9024.
 
Claims must be filed no later than one year after the date of service or, in the 
case of inpatient care, within one year of the discharge date.
If you use a provider who accepts CHAMPVA assignment or one of the VA’s 
network pharmacies, it will file the claim form for you.
Home Loan Guarantees
Surviving spouses of certain veterans are eligible to obtain loans under the 
VA Home Loan program. So I don’t have to explain the home loan program all 
over again, please refer to Chapter 13 for details about this program.
You’re eligible for a VA home loan if you
 
✓ Are an unmarried spouse of a veteran who died while in service or from 
a service-connected disability (see Chapter 6 for information about 
disabilities)
 
✓ Are a spouse of a serviceperson missing in action or who is a prisoner 
of war
 
A surviving spouse who remarried before December 16, 2003, and on or after 
reaching age 57 loses eligibility for the VA Home Loan program. However, if 
that marriage ends, eligibility may be reestablished.

H
ave you ever attended a military funeral? If so, I think you’ll agree when 
I say it’s one of the most dignified and respectful ways to be laid to 
rest. It’s an experience you never forget.
When taps is played and the members of the honor guard give the final salute 
to their fallen comrade, it’s impossible not to reflect on this solemn final trib-
ute offered to our veteran loved ones who were not only heroes in our hearts, 
but heroes to our nation’s freedom as well. When the United States flag is 
folded and respectfully presented to the next of kin, you hear the words, “As 
a representative of the United States Army (Air Force/Navy/Marine Corps/
Coast Guard), it is my high privilege to present you this flag. Let it be a 
symbol of the grateful appreciation this nation feels for the distinguished ser-
vice rendered to our country and our flag by your loved one.”
We all pass on at some time. That’s the universal truth of life. A funeral can 
cost thousands of dollars, and a huge funeral bill isn’t the final gift I want 
to give my daughters. I would rather they use the money to throw a huge 
party in my honor — to celebrate my life, not mourn my passing. However, 
I do want to be placed in my final resting place with a modicum of dignity 
and respect. To that end, I plan to make sure they keep a copy of this book 
handy, so when the time comes (hopefully not soon), they can turn to this 
chapter and take advantage of the free burial and memorial benefits available 
to veterans.

150
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Eligibility for Military Burial
Most, but not all, veterans are eligible for veterans burial and memorial ben-
efits. You’re eligible if you fall into one of the following categories:
 
✓ President or former presidents of the United States, based on their ser-
vice as commander in chief. If you’ve ever been president of the U.S., 
you probably don’t need to read any further in this chapter. Presumably, 
someone will take care of your funeral arrangements for you.
 
✓ Veterans who die while on active duty. This includes active duty for 
training for members of the reserves and National Guard. See Chapter 2 
for information about Guard and Reserve duty.
 
✓ Veterans who have active-duty service on or before September 7, 1980 
(enlisted), and on or before October 16, 1981 (officers), and have a dis-
charge characterization that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
doesn’t consider dishonorable. See Chapter 2 for information about dis-
charge characterizations.
 
✓ Veterans with service beginning after September 7, 1980, as an enlisted 
person, and service after October 16, 1981, as an officer, with at least 24 
months of continuous, active-duty service. Again, such veterans must 
have a discharge characterization that the VA doesn’t consider dishon-
orable, as explained in Chapter 2.
 
✓ Members of the National Guard or Reserves who were called to active 
duty for less than 24 months and served during the entire period of the 
call-up. These veterans must also have a discharge characterization that 
the VA doesn’t consider dishonorable, according the criteria listed in 
Chapter 2.
 
✓ Reservists and National Guard members who, at the time of death, were 
entitled to retired pay, or would have been entitled, but for being under the 
age of 60. Chapter 7 has information about the military retirement system.
 
✓ Reservists who die due to an injury or illness incurred or aggravated by 
military service.
Meeting conditions for burial expenses
If a veteran is buried or inurned in a private cemetery, the government is 
willing to pick up some of the expenses, as long as the veteran meets certain 
criteria. In addition to the eligibility criteria for burial listed in the preceding 
section, at least one of the following conditions must be met:
 
✓ The veteran died because of a service-related disability.
 
✓ The veteran was receiving VA pension or compensation at the time of 
death.

151
 Chapter 9: Burial and Memorial Benefits
 
✓ The veteran was entitled to receive VA pension or compensation, but 
decided not to reduce his military retirement or disability pay.
 
✓ The veteran died while hospitalized by the VA or while receiving care 
under VA contract at a non-VA facility.
 
✓ The veteran died while traveling under proper authorization and at VA 
expense to or from a specified place for the purpose of examination, 
treatment, or care.
 
✓ The veteran had an original or reopened claim pending at the time of 
death, and the VA ruled he was entitled to compensation or pension 
from a date before the date of death.
 
✓ The veteran died on or after October 9, 1996, while a patient at a 
VA-approved state nursing home.
Getting into Arlington
Arlington National Cemetery has strict eligibility criteria. For one thing, eligi-
ble veterans must have a fully honorable discharge, not just a discharge that 
the VA considers to be other than dishonorable. (For details about discharge 
characterizations, see Chapter 2.)
Burial at Arlington National Cemetery is an exclusive honor, restricted to 
those who fit one of the following categories:
 
✓ Service members who die on active duty, except those on duty-for-
training purposes only.
 
✓ Active-duty retirees. See Chapter 7 for information about the military 
retirement system.
 
✓ Reserve and National Guard retirees age 60 and older who are drawing 
retired pay at the time of death and who have served a period of active 
duty for more than training purposes. Again, Chapter 7 has complete 
information about military retirement.
 
✓ Veterans who have been awarded the Medal of Honor, Distinguished 
Service Cross, Air Force Cross, Navy Cross, Distinguished Service Medal, 
Silver Star, or Purple Heart.
 
✓ Former prisoners of war who died on or after November 30, 1993.
 
✓ Widows and widowers of service members who are officially determined 
missing in action.
 
✓ Spouses, widows, widowers, minor children, permanently dependent 
children, and certain unmarried adult children of eligible veterans. 
(When spouses or children die first, service members must agree in writ-
ing to be buried at the same site.)

152
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
A Final Place to Rest: 
Selecting a Cemetery
The VA operates 141 national cemeteries throughout the United States and 
its territories. Take a look at Appendix E for locations and contact informa-
tion for all national cemeteries.
The United States has been doing this for quite a while now. On July 17, 1862, 
Congress enacted legislation that authorized the president to purchase “cem-
etery grounds” to be used as national cemeteries “for soldiers who shall have 
died in the service of the country.” Fourteen cemeteries were established 
that first year. To date, more than 3 million Americans, including veterans of 
every war and conflict — from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War — are 
honored by burial in U.S. national cemeteries. Approximately 17,000 acres 
of land from Hawaii to Maine, and from Alaska to Puerto Rico are devoted 
to the memory of those who served our nation. More than 300 recipients of 
the Medal of Honor (our nation’s highest military medal) are buried in U.S. 
national cemeteries.
Most states operate one or more cemeteries dedicated or reserved for 
military veterans. Eligibility criteria, services provided, and costs can vary 
greatly from one state to another. For a complete list of state-sponsored vet-
erans cemeteries, including links to eligibility criteria, services, and an appli-
cation, see www.cem.va.gov/cem/scg/lsvc.asp.
In addition to national and state cemeteries, certain veterans may be eligible 
for burial in other veterans cemeteries, such as Arlington or National Park 
Service cemeteries, as well. I explain more in the following sections.
Who can be buried where?
Eligible veterans (see the “Eligibility for Military Burial” section) can be 
buried for free in any of the 141 national cemeteries with available space. 
Services include opening and closing of the grave, perpetual care, a govern-
ment headstone or marker, a burial flag, and a presidential memorial certifi-
cate at no cost to the family.
Cremated remains are buried or inurned in national cemeteries in the same 
manner and with the same honors (see the “Giving a Final Salute with Military 
Funeral Honors” section) as casketed remains.

153
 Chapter 9: Burial and Memorial Benefits
Spouses and dependents of eligible veterans are also eligible for burial in 
national cemeteries. This is true even if they predecease the veteran. Benefits 
include burial with the veteran and perpetual care. The spouse or depen-
dent’s name and date of birth and death are inscribed on the veteran’s head-
stone. Again, there is no cost to the family for these services.
 
The spouse or surviving spouse of an eligible veteran can be buried in a 
national cemetery, even if that veteran isn’t buried or memorialized in a 
national cemetery. In addition, the surviving spouse of a member of the armed 
forces whose remains are unavailable for burial is also eligible for burial. In 
this case, the spouse would be eligible for a free headstone from the VA.
A surviving spouse who remarries a nonveteran may be buried in a national 
cemetery, as long as the death of the veteran’s surviving spouse occurred 
after January 1, 2000.
For the most part, eligible dependents are unmarried children under the age 
of 21. If the child is a full-time student, the cutoff age is 23.
Also eligible are the unmarried adult children of eligible veterans if the indi-
vidual is permanently physically or mentally disabled and incapable of self-
support. The disability must have occurred before the age of 21 (or age 23 if 
a full-time student).
When certain conditions are met, service members may be buried in the 
same grave with a close relative already buried at some cemeteries, includ-
ing Arlington. This generally requires approval of the cemetery staff and 
approval by the next of kin of the previously deceased relative.
National Park Service cemeteries
The National Park Service (NPS), under the U.S. Department of Interior, main-
tains 14 cemeteries nationwide. These include
 
✓ Andersonville National Historic Site, Andersonville, Georgia
 
✓ Andrew Johnson National Historic Site, Greenville, Tennessee
 
✓ Antietam National Cemetery, Sharpsburg, Maryland
 
✓ Battleground National Cemetery, Washington, D.C.
 
✓ Colonial National Historical Park, Yorktown, Virginia
 
✓ Fort Donelson National Battlefield, Dover, Tennessee

154
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
 
✓ Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County Battlefield Memorial National 
Military Park, Fredericksburg, Virginia
 
✓ Gettysburg National Military Park, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania
 
✓ Jean Lafitte National Historical Park, New Orleans, Louisiana
 
✓ Little Bighorn Battle National Monument, Crow Agency, Montana
 
✓ Petersburg National Cemetery, Petersburg, Virginia
 
✓ Shiloh National Military Park, Shiloh, Tennessee
 
✓ Stones River National Battlefield, Murfreesboro, Tennessee
 
✓ Vicksburg National Military Park, Vicksburg, Mississippi
Only two of these NPS cemeteries, Andersonville National Historic Site and 
Andrew Johnson National Historic Site, are classified as active, meaning they 
continue to bury veterans and their dependents.
Veterans who meet the eligibility criteria (see the “Eligibility for Military 
Burial” section) and their dependents may elect to be buried in either of 
these cemeteries. As with national cemeteries, there’s no cost to the family.
To apply for burial benefits at Andersonville National Historic Site or 
Andrew Johnson National Historic Site, contact the Department of Interior 
at Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 1849 C St., NW, 
Washington, DC 20240, or phone 202-208-4747.
Arlington National Cemetery: 
A special case
More than 285,000 people have been laid to rest at Arlington National 
Cemetery. Across its rolling hills stand the unadorned headstones of vet-
erans from the Revolutionary War to the current struggles in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.
Arlington may be a national cemetery, but it’s not managed by the VA. 
Arlington is managed and operated by the U.S. Army and has additional eli-
gibility criteria (see the “Getting into Arlington” section earlier in the chap-
ter). For information about making burial arrangements at Arlington, see the 
“Applying for Arlington” section later in the chapter.
Those eligible for burial can also opt for inurnment. Also eligible for inurn-
ment are any veterans with a fully honorable discharge, their spouses, and 
their dependent children. Each niche has room for two urns and is sealed 
with a marble plaque that bears the names and years of birth and death of 
those within.

 Chapter 9: Burial and Memorial Benefits
What the VA Does and Doesn’t Cover
When a veteran or his qualifying dependents are buried or inurned in a 
national cemetery, Arlington, or a National Park cemetery, the government 
will pay for opening and closing of the grave, perpetual care, a headstone or 
marker, and a burial flag.
If the veteran or his qualifying dependents are buried in a state veterans cem-
etery, burial services are provided by the individual state, not by the VA, and 
available services can vary widely from one state to another, and even from 
one state veterans cemetery to another within the same state. But what if the 
veteran is buried or inurned in a private cemetery? Will the government pick 
up the cost?
The government probably won’t cover all the costs, but you may be eligible 
for reimbursement from the VA for burial expenses if you paid for a veteran’s 
burial or funeral and you have not been reimbursed by another government 
agency or some other source, such as burial insurance or the deceased vet-
eran’s employer. The VA also provides headstones and markers, presidential 
memorial certificates (PMCs), and burial flags. More on those later in this 
section.
What the VA doesn’t cover
Regardless of where a veteran or eligible family member is buried, the VA 
doesn’t pay for cremation, preparation of the deceased (embalming), casket 
or urn, or transportation to the cemetery. Of course, some of these expenses 
may be reimbursed if the veteran meets the eligibility criteria listed in the 
next section. However, in certain situations, the government will cover some 
of these costs. Here are the exceptions:
 
✓ When a military member dies while on active duty, the military ser-
vice (not the VA) will pick up most of the costs, including cremation, 
embalming, casket or urn, funeral director services, and transportation 
of remains. In fact, the military will even pay for a family member to 
accompany the remains from the place of death to the funeral home. For 
Reserve and National Guard members, this includes active duty for train-
ing (ADT) and inactive duty training (IDT), as explained in Chapter 2.
 
✓ The military will pay to transfer the remains of military retirees and their 
family members who die while admitted to a military hospital, provided 
the place of burial is no farther than the deceased’s last residence.
 
✓ If a veteran dies while admitted to a VA facility, such as a VA medical 
center or nursing home, the VA will pay the cost of transporting the 
remains to a national cemetery, provided the cemetery is no farther 
than the deceased’s last residence.

156
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
How much does the VA pay?
The costs covered by the VA depend on whether the death was related to the 
veteran’s military service. The VA pays more for veterans who die because of a 
service-related medical condition or injury than it does for non-service-related 
deaths. When the cause of death is not service related, the reimbursements are 
generally described as two payments:
 
✓ A burial and funeral expense allowance
 
✓ A plot or interment allowance
For a service-related death, the VA will pay up to $2,000 toward burial 
expenses for deaths on or after September 11, 2001. The VA will pay up to 
$1,500 for deaths prior to September 10, 2001. If the veteran is buried in a VA 
national cemetery, some or all of the cost of transporting the deceased may 
be reimbursed.
For a non-service-related death, the VA will pay up to $300 toward burial and 
funeral expenses and a $300 plot-interment allowance for deaths on or after 
December 1, 2001. The plot-interment allowance is $150 for deaths prior to 
December 1, 2001. If the death happened while the veteran was in a VA hos-
pital or under VA-contracted nursing home care, some or all of the costs for 
transporting the veteran’s remains may be reimbursed.
 
The VA doesn’t pay these benefits in advance. You must have copies of the 
funeral bills, and they must show that they have been paid in full to qualify for 
reimbursement. Additionally, if the cause of death wasn’t service-related, you 
must file your claim within two years from the date of death. There is no time 
limit for service-connected claims.
Furnishing markers and headstones
When someone is buried or memorialized in a national cemetery, state vet-
erans cemetery, or National Park cemetery, a headstone or marker is part of 
the package. However, the VA also furnishes, upon request, a government 
headstone or marker for the unmarked grave of any deceased eligible veteran 
in any cemetery around the world. (See the “Eligibility for Military Burial” 
section for eligibility criteria.)
Because of a change in the law, the VA also provides for eligible veterans who 
died on or after November 1, 1990, a headstone or marker for graves already 
marked with a private headstone or marker.

157
 Chapter 9: Burial and Memorial Benefits
As with other veteran burial benefits, the VA doesn’t charge for the head-
stones or markers it provides. However, like all things governmental, you 
need to submit the proper paperwork. See the “Obtaining markers and head-
stones” section later in the chapter for details.
 
Although there’s no charge for the headstone or marker itself, arrangements 
for placing it in a private cemetery are the applicant’s responsibility, and all 
setting fees are at private expense.
The VA offers several types of markers and headstones, including upright 
headstones, flat grave markers, bronze niche markers, and a new headstone 
medallion that the VA plans to have available in 2009:
 
✓ Upright headstones: These headstones are 42 inches high, 13 inches 
wide, and 4 inches thick. They weigh about 230 pounds and are available 
in marble or granite.
 
✓ Flat grave markers: The flat grave markers are available in bronze, 
marble, or granite. The flat bronze grave marker is 24 inches long and 
12 inches wide, with a 3/4-inch rise, and weighs about 18 pounds. The flat 
granite and flat marble grave markers are 24 inches long, 12 inches wide, 
and 4 inches thick. Weight is approximately 130 pounds.
 
 Anchor bolts, nuts, and washers for fastening to a base are furnished 
with the marker. However, the government doesn’t furnish a base.
 
✓ Bronze niche marker: This niche marker is 81/2 inches long and 51/2 
inches wide, with a 7/16-inch rise, and weighs approximately 3 pounds. As 
with the flat grave markers, mounting bolts and washers are furnished 
with the marker.
The VA is also developing a medallion to be affixed to an existing privately 
purchased headstone or marker to signify the deceased’s status as a veteran. 
When available, it can be furnished in lieu of a traditional government head-
stone or marker to those veterans who died on or after November 1, 1990, 
and whose grave is marked with a privately purchased headstone or marker.
 
Spouses and dependents aren’t eligible for a government-furnished headstone 
or marker unless they are buried in a national cemetery, National Park Service 
cemetery, Arlington, or state veterans cemetery.
Adding an inscription
Mandatory items of inscription on government-furnished headstones at gov-
ernment expense are legal name, branch of service, year of birth, and year of 
death.

158
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
In addition to the mandatory facts, you can request that optional information 
be included at government expense. Optional items include month and day 
of birth; month and day of death; highest rank attained; medals earned; war 
service; and emblem of belief.
 
War service includes active-duty service during a recognized period of war, 
but the individual does not have to have served in the actual place of war. For 
example, “Vietnam” may be inscribed if the veteran served during the Vietnam 
War period, even though the individual never served in Vietnam itself.
You can also request that space be reserved for future inscriptions at pri-
vate expense, such as a spouse or dependent’s data. Only two lines of space 
may be reserved on flat markers due to space limitations. Reserved space is 
unnecessary on upright marble or granite headstones because the reverse 
side is available for future inscriptions.
You may request additional items on the headstone or marker if space is 
available. Examples of acceptable items include terms of endearment, nick-
names (in expressions such as “Our beloved Poppy”), and military or civilian 
credentials or accomplishments, such as “Doctor,” “Reverend,” and so on. All 
requests for additional items at government expense are subject to approval 
by the VA.
Replacing headstones and markers
Headstones and markers previously furnished by the government may be 
replaced at government expense if badly deteriorated, illegible, stolen, or 
vandalized. The VA will also replace the headstone or marker if the inscrip-
tion is incorrect, if it was damaged during shipping, or if the material or work-
manship doesn’t meet government contract specifications.
 
If a government headstone or marker in a private cemetery is damaged by 
cemetery personnel, the cemetery should pay all replacement costs.
Providing presidential 
memorial certificates
A presidential memorial certificate (PMC) is an engraved paper certificate, 
signed by the current president, to honor the memory of honorably discharged 
veterans. The certificate is available in memory of any deceased veteran, as 
long as he received a military discharge that the VA doesn’t consider dishonor-
able. (See Chapter 2 for information about discharge characterizations.)

159
 Chapter 9: Burial and Memorial Benefits
This program was initiated in March 1962 by President John F. Kennedy and 
has been continued by all subsequent presidents.
 
If you’re the next-of-kin, family member, loved one, or even a friend of an eli-
gible deceased veteran, you may request a PCM from the VA. More than one 
certificate may be issued, and there is no time limit for requesting one. To find 
out how to obtain a certificate, see the “Requesting a presidential memorial 
certificate” section later in the chapter.
Receiving a burial flag
The VA provides a United States flag, at no cost, to drape the casket or 
accompany the urn of a deceased eligible veteran (See the “Eligibility for 
Military Burials” section). It is furnished to honor the memory of a veteran’s 
military service to his country.
Generally, the flag is given to the next of kin as a keepsake after its use 
during the funeral service (see the “Giving a Final Salute with Military Funeral 
Honors” section). When there is no next of kin, the VA can furnish the flag to 
a friend who requests it.
Memorial flags can’t be replaced at government expense if they are lost, dam-
aged, or stolen. The law allows for only one burial flag to be furnished at gov-
ernment expense.
 
Most family members elect to display the memorial flag in a specially con-
structed flag case. Several varieties are available in military surplus stores and 
for purchase on the Internet.
 
The memorial flag isn’t suitable for flying on a flag pole or displaying outdoors 
because of its size and fabric. It’s made of cotton and can easily be damaged 
by weather.
Giving a Final Salute with 
Military Funeral Honors
Military funeral honors aren’t provided by the VA, but rather by the 
Department of Defense (DOD). The military services have a long tradition 
of providing funeral honors for fallen veterans of their branches. However, 
during the military drawdowns of the late ’80s and ’90s, as resources began 
to stretch, the DOD found this harder and harder to do.

160
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
That’s when various veteran organizations, such as the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars (VFW) and the American Legion, stepped in to pick up the slack. These 
organizations volunteered to conduct funeral honors for fallen deceased 
veterans when the DOD was forced to decline due to lack of manpower and 
resources.
Many members of Congress thought this was atrocious (even though the 
congressionally mandated downsizing of the military caused the problem in 
the first place). In 1999, Congress passed a law requiring the military services 
to provide funeral honors for eligible veterans (see the “Eligibility for Military 
Burial” section).
Under the law, the DOD must provide, upon request, an honor guard consisting 
of at least two military members to provide funeral honors for fallen eligible 
veterans. The law requires that at least one member of the detail be a rep-
resentative of the parent armed service of the deceased veteran. The honor 
detail must, at a minimum, perform a ceremony that includes the folding and 
presenting of the American flag to the next of kin and the playing of taps.
For information about requesting an honor guard at a veteran’s funeral, see 
the later section “Setting up military funeral honors.”
Meeting military honor guards
Almost every military installation has an honor guard team. Members of the 
honor guard are trained in military drill and ceremonies, and provide memo-
rial honors, upon request, at the funerals of eligible veterans.
It may surprise you to know that military honor guard teams are comprised 
almost exclusively of volunteers who practice, drill, and perform funeral 
honors in their off-duty time. Although the military pays for their honor 
guard uniforms, equipment, and transportation expenses, most of these dedi-
cated individuals also have other full-time military jobs.
Each of the services do have one or two full-time honor guard units. These 
are the teams you often see on TV at major ceremonial events or in front of 
the White House to welcome distinguished visitors. They also often perform 
funeral honors for deceased U.S. presidents and other high-ranking officials.
However, most military funeral honors are performed by individual honor 
guard teams stationed at most military bases. My hat is off to these silent 
heroes, who dedicate their own time to honor our fallen military comrades.

161
 Chapter 9: Burial and Memorial Benefits
 
The law requires the DOD to provide a minimum of two honor guard members 
to conduct honors at a veteran’s funeral. However, usually a funeral detail 
consists of between four and seven members. Much depends on the capabili-
ties of the local honor guard unit, available resources, and manpower. Other 
factors, such as if there are other veteran funerals occurring in the area at the 
same time, may also affect availability.
Knowing what honors are provided
The law requires the DOD to play taps, fold the U.S. flag, and present the flag 
to the next of kin. However, other honors, such as honor guard pallbearers 
and a rifle volley, may be offered, depending on the resources available to the 
honor guard unit and desires of the family. Here are the specifics of what’s 
involved:
 
✓ Taps: Taps is the customary bugle call played at military funerals. The 
law requires taps to be played by a bugler, if available, but very few 
buglers are in the military these days, so it’s usually played by elec-
tronic means. During the playing of taps, the honor guard presents a 
final salute to the deceased veteran.
 
✓ Flag folding: The U.S. flag is carefully removed from the coffin and sol-
emnly folded by members of the honor guard team. When completely 
folded, the flag forms a triangle, which is representative of the tri-
cornered hats worn by colonial soldiers during the Revolutionary War. 
The procedure involves 13 folds, representing the original colonies. 
When all the folds have been made, no red or white stripes are visible, 
leaving only the honor field of blue and stars.
 
✓ Flag presentation: The folded flag is given to an honor guard member 
who is in the same military branch as the deceased veteran. The ser-
vice representative marches slowly to the next of kin and presents the 
flag with the words, “As a representative of the United States Army (Air 
Force/Navy/Marine Corps/Coast Guard), it is my high privilege to pre-
sent you this flag. Let it be a symbol of the grateful appreciation this 
nation feels for the distinguished service rendered to our country and 
our flag by your loved one.”
 
 If there is no next of kin, the flag may be presented to a friend of the 
deceased.
 
✓ Pallbearers: If manpower is available, family members can request that 
members of the honor guard act as pallbearers, in addition to providing 
other funeral honors.

162
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
 
✓ Rifle volley: At military funerals, you often see three volleys of shots 
fired in honor of the deceased veteran. This tradition is performed by 
honor guard teams, based on family desires and available resources. 
The rifle volley is often mistaken by nonmilitary folks as a 21-gun salute, 
although it’s entirely different. In the military, a gun is a large-caliber 
weapon. The three volleys are fired from rifles, not guns. Therefore, the 
three volleys aren’t any kind of gun salute at all. The firing team can con-
sist of any number, but it’s usually made up of seven or eight members. 
Whether the team consists of three, eight, or ten, each member fires 
three times (three volleys).
 
 The three volleys come from an old battlefield custom. The warring 
sides would cease hostilities to clear their dead from the battlefield, and 
the firing of three volleys meant that the dead had been properly cared 
for and the side was ready to resume the battle.
 
 The honor guard often slips three shell-casings into the folded flag 
before presenting the flag to the family. Each casing represents one 
volley.
Arranging Military Funerals
When it’s time to lay a veteran to rest, you have a couple of options. Your 
choice affects how arrangements are made:
 
✓ A veteran can be buried in a national cemetery, Arlington, a National 
Park Service cemetery, or a state veterans cemetery (see Appendix E 
for contact information for national cemeteries). If one of these rest-
ing places is chosen, the funeral director will take care of most of the 
arrangements for you, and the government will handle most of the 
expenses. However, proof of the veteran’s eligibility, such as DD Form 
214 (see Chapter 2), must be presented.
 
✓ If the veteran is buried in a private cemetery, the funeral director can 
help you set up the military arrangements, and you will have to seek 
reimbursement for the expenses. You will have to provide proof of the 
veteran’s eligibility, such as DD Form 214 (see Chapter 2), to receive 
military funeral honors.
 
When supplying proof of eligibility or other official records, do not send origi-
nal documents because they will not be returned.
The following sections explain how to arrange for specific details of a military 
funeral service and burial.

163
 Chapter 9: Burial and Memorial Benefits
Seeking reimbursement for 
private funeral expenses
If you choose to have your loved one buried in a private cemetery and you 
want to be reimbursed for funeral and burial expenses, you can apply by fill-
ing out VA Form 21-530, Application for Burial Benefits. You may download 
the form from the VA’s Web site at www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-
21-530-ARE.pdf. You should attach a copy of the veteran’s military dis-
charge document, death certificate, and funeral/burial bills. The bills should 
show that they have been paid in full. The completed form may be submitted 
to any VA regional office. See Appendix B for office locations.
 
A claim for non-service-connected burial expenses or plot allowance must 
be filed with the VA within two years of the date of the veteran’s permanent 
burial or cremation. There is no time limit for service-connected deaths.
Setting up military funeral honors
You can arrange for military funeral honors by contacting the honor guard 
representative for the branch of the military in which the deceased served. 
Table 9-1 gives the phone numbers for each branch’s honor guard teams, 
arranged by state or U.S. territory.
 
Veteran service organizations, such as the American Legion or Veterans 
of Foreign Wars (VFW), can often assist with arranging military funeral 
honors. This is especially true if the deceased veteran was a member of the 
organization.

If you have difficulty reaching the appropriate point of contact, call 877-MIL-
HONR (877-645-4667). A service representative will help you get in touch with 
the appropriate honor guard unit.
Applying for Arlington
When a veteran wants to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery, arrange-
ments, including burial site selection, are made only upon the individual’s 
death. Arrangements are typically coordinated between staffs at the 
deceased’s funeral home and the cemetery. Cemetery staff can also help 
schedule use of the nearby Fort Myer Chapel, as well as arrange for a military 
chaplain when a family minister isn’t preferred.

167
 Chapter 9: Burial and Memorial Benefits
Upon the veteran’s death, you should contact a local funeral home to arrange 
for any desired services in the hometown. The funeral director should call 
the Interment Office at Arlington (703-607-8585) to arrange for the burial. 
Before scheduling the service, the cemetery staff will need to determine the 
veteran’s eligibility (see the earlier “Getting into Arlington” section), so you 
need to have proof of the veteran’s service, such as a DD Form 214, on hand. 
You can fax any documents that prove eligibility to the cemetery at 703-607-
8583. Upon verification of eligibility, the Arlington cemetery staff will sched-
ule the funeral.
The next available gravesite or niche is assigned on the afternoon before the 
burial service. The Arlington cemetery staff assigns graves and niches with-
out regard to the veteran’s military rank, race, color, creed, or gender. The 
family may request a burial location close to other family members buried or 
inurned within the cemetery; however, limited space may prevent the cem-
etery from accommodating such requests.
Obtaining markers and headstones
When burial is in a national cemetery, National Park cemetery, or state vet-
erans cemetery, the cemetery officials order a headstone or marker and use 
inscription information provided by the next of kin.
When burial is in a private cemetery, the next of kin or a representative, such 
as a funeral director, must submit VA Form 40-1330, Application for Standard 
Government Headstone or Marker for Installation in a Private Cemetery or a 
State Veterans Cemetery, along with the veteran’s military discharge docu-
ments, to request a government-provided headstone or marker.
You can obtain VA Form 40-1330 from any VA regional office (see Appendix B 
for contact information). The form is also available online at www.va.gov/
vaforms/va/pdf/40-1330.pdf. Send the completed form and proof of 
military service by mail to Memorial Programs Service (41A1), Department of 
Veterans Affairs, 5109 Russell Road, Quantico, VA 22134-3903; or fax to 800-
455-7143.
Requesting a presidential 
memorial certificate
To request a presidential memorial certificate, you’ll need a copy of the 
deceased’s death certificate and proof of honorable military service, such as 
the veteran’s DD Form 214.

168
Part II: A Healthy Look at Medical Care and Compensation Programs 
Complete a VA Form 40-0247, Presidential Memorial Certificate Request Form, 
which is available from any VA regional office (see Appendix B) and online 
at www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA40-0247.pdf. Mail it, along with 
proof of honorable service and a copy of the death certificate, to Presidential 
Memorial Certificates (41A1C), National Cemetery Administration, 5109 
Russell Road, Quantico, VA 22134-3903. You may also fax the required docu-
ments to 800-455-7143.
 
The funeral home may order a certificate for you. Additionally, some state vet-
erans cemeteries automatically order a PMC, so you’ll want to check with the 
cemetery administrator before ordering.
Obtaining a burial flag
You may apply for the flag by completing VA Form 21-2008, Application for 
United States Flag for Burial Purposes, which is available online at www.vba.
va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA21-2008.pdf. The form is also available from VA 
regional offices (see Appendix B) and any United States Post Office. You may 
take the completed form, along with proof of military service, such as a DD 
Form 214, to any VA regional office or U.S. Post Office and receive the flag.
 
Generally, the funeral director will help you obtain the flag. If burial is in a 
national cemetery, National Park Service cemetery, or state veterans cem-
etery, the flag will usually be obtained by the cemetery staff.

Understanding 
Education and

In this part . . .
W
ant a free college education? How about voca-
tional training? Thanks to veterans benefits, not 
only can you get a free college degree, you may be able to 
get special vocational training. And after you’ve earned a 
degree or completed a training program, you can get help 
entering the real world and earning a living. 
Many veterans qualify for special preference when apply-
ing for federal government jobs, so the information in this 
part also tells you how qualify for one of these positions. 
Or, if you’d rather work for yourself, you can obtain a 
small business loan guarantee from the Small Business 
Administration. Read on to find out how!

H
ave I got a deal for you! What would you say if I asked you to give me 
$1,200, and in exchange I would give you $47,556 to go to college? Or, if 
you don’t like that deal, how about if you give me nothing, and I provide you 
with $11,844 worth of education benefits?
Still not excited? How about if you pay nothing, and I pay your full tuition, 
a monthly housing stipend, and up to $1,000 per academic year for books 
and fees?
These deals describe the Active-Duty and Selected Reserve Montgomery GI 
bills and the new GI Bill of the 21st Century, in a nutshell. Of course, to get 
the money, you may have to agree to forgo some of your military pay, serve 
for so many months, and choose an educational program that the military 
deems acceptable. And if you have active-duty service after September 11, 
2001, you may qualify for the mega-bonuses offered by the GI Bill of the 
21st Century.
Okay, using the GI Bill in any one of its forms is not really as simple as it 
sounds. After all, these are government-administered programs, and under 
the rules of bureaucracy, it’s not allowed to be that simple. Don’t worry. I’m 
here to uncomplicate the complicated.

172
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
Getting Cash for College: 
The Active-Duty GI Bill
Under the Active-Duty Montgomery GI Bill (ADMGIB), active-duty members for-
feit $100 per month of their military pay for their first 12 months of active-duty 
service. In exchange, they receive 36 months of full-time education benefits.
 
If you enlist on active duty on or after August 1, 2009, you’ll no longer be 
allowed to enroll in the ADMGIB. Your educational entitlements will be cov-
ered under the brand-new GI Bill of the 21st Century. For details, see the “GI 
Bill of the 21st Century” section later in this chapter.
You must either accept or decline the ADMGIB in writing during the first 
couple of weeks of military basic training. If you accept the ADMGIB, your 
military pay is reduced by $100 per month for the first 12 months of active-
duty service, and then you can receive education benefits if you otherwise 
qualify. More about that in the following sections.
 
If you decline the ADMGIB in basic training, that’s it. No second chances. Well, 
that’s not entirely true. Every once in a while, Congress makes an exception. 
During the late ’80s, Congress offered an open period during which service 
members and veterans who originally elected not to participate could change 
their minds. In the late ’80s and early ’90s, veterans who were discharged as 
part of the military’s drawdown were offered ADMGIB benefits as part of their 
incentive package.
Doing the time and double-checking 
other eligibility requirements
The original GI Bill only required you to perform a minimum of 90 days of 
active-duty service to establish eligibility. Times change.
If your initial service obligation (enlistment contract, commissioning agree-
ment, and so on) is for three or more years of active-duty service, you must 
serve on active duty for at least three years before establishing eligibility to 
use your ADMGIB benefits. If your initial service obligation is for less than 
three years, you must serve on active duty for at least two years before 
you’re eligible to apply for benefits.
If you separate before performing the minimum required active-duty service, 
you may still be eligible for partial or even full benefits, depending on the 
reason for your active-duty discharge. For details, see “Meeting your service 
obligation” later in this section.

173
 Chapter 10: Advancing Your Education through the GI Bill
Don’t drop out: The need for a high school education
You don’t need a high school education to enroll in the ADMGIB, but before 
you can apply for benefits under the program, you must first obtain a high 
school diploma or equivalency certificate, or complete a minimum of 12 
hours toward a college degree.
 
Congress made a change in eligibility rules that took effect November 1, 2000. 
If you weren’t previously eligible because you didn’t meet the high school 
diploma requirement, the change may provide a second chance. You may be 
eligible if you now meet the high school requirement and reapply for ADMGIB 
benefits. If eligible, you have until November 2, 2010, or ten years from the 
date of your last discharge from active duty, whichever is later, to use your 
benefits.
Checking your discharge characterization
Most veterans benefits managed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
don’t require an honorable discharge. As long as the VA determines that 
your service was not other than honorable, you may be eligible for benefits. I 
explain this in detail in Chapter 2.
Setting up the modern GI Bill
The active-duty GI Bill — fondly referred to 
as ADMGIB — has been around in one form 
or another since 1944. The Servicemen’s 
Readjustment Act of 1944 — commonly known 
as the GI Bill of Rights — provided up to $500 
per school year to honorably discharged veter-
ans. The program was a dramatic success. By 
1947, military veterans accounted for 49 percent 
of all college admissions in the United States. 
As of 1956, 7.8 million of 16 million World War 
II veterans had participated in an education or 
training program under the GI Bill.
In 1952, the original GI Bill was replaced by the 
Veterans’ Readjustment Act, providing educa-
tion benefits for veterans of the Korean conflict. 
This benefit, in turn, was updated in 1966, by 
what is commonly referred to as the “Vietnam-
era GI Bill.” This version provided not only edu-
cation benefits, but also living expenses for the 
veteran and his dependents while attending 
college.
In 1976, the Vietnam-era GI Bill was replaced by 
the Veterans Educational Assistance Program 
(VEAP). This marked the first time that service 
members were required to contribute funds 
in order to receive education benefits. Under 
VEAP, service members could deposit $100 
per month (up to a total of $2,700) into a fund 
and receive 36 months of full-time education 
benefits.
In 1984, former Mississippi Congressman 
Gillespie V. “Sonny” Montgomery sponsored 
legislation to replace VEAP with a new GI Bill, 
which has been known as the “Active Duty 
Montgomery GI Bill” ever since.
In June 2008, Congress enacted new legisla-
tion that dramatically expanded the GI Bill. 
Congress called this new GI Bill the “GI Bill of 
the 21st Century.” You, lucky reader, are going 
to be among the first to read about this new 
program.

174
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
Eligibility for the ADMGIB, on the other hand, is an exception to this general 
rule. To use ADMGIB after you’re separated from active duty, your discharge 
must be fully honorable. Discharges under honorable conditions and general 
discharges don’t establish eligibility for ADMGIB.
However, if you have more than one period of service and receive an other-
than-honorable discharge from one period, you may be able to qualify for 
ADMGIB if you receive an honorable discharge from another period of ser-
vice. (A period from which you were discharged in order to reenlist may 
meet the eligibility requirements.)
Meeting your service obligation
 
If your initial active-duty service obligation is for three or more years, you 
must serve on active duty for at least three years to retain your ADMGIB eligi-
bility. If your active-duty contract is for less than three years, you must serve 
at least two of those years on active duty to keep your benefits.
However, there are certain exceptions to the minimum service rule. If you 
don’t complete the required period of service, you may still be eligible if you 
were separated early for one of the following reasons:
 
✓ Convenience of the government: Discharge reasons that fall under 
this category include early release to further education, early release to 
accept public office, pregnancy or childbirth, parenthood, conscientious 
objection, and surviving family member.
 
 To retain your full ADMGIB benefits (36 months) if you were discharged 
under this category, you must have 30 months of continuous active 
duty if your obligation was 3 or more years, or 20 months of continuous 
active duty if your obligation was less than 3 years.
 
✓ Service-connected disability: You’d think that veterans who were dis-
charged early because of a disability they suffered because of active-
duty service would retain full ADMGIB benefits, but — for reasons 
known only to lawmakers — that’s not the way Congress worded the 
ADMGIB law. Veterans discharged early with a service-connected dis-
ability receive one month’s ADMGIB benefit for each month served on 
active duty (up to the maximum entitlement of 36 months).
 
✓ Hardship: If you request it and Uncle Sam agrees, you can be discharged 
early when genuine dependency or undue hardship exists. Veterans dis-
charged early for approved hardships receive reduced ADMGIB benefits 
at the rate of one month’s education benefit for each month served on 
active duty (up to 36 months).

175
 Chapter 10: Advancing Your Education through the GI Bill
 
✓ Previously existing medical conditions: Sometimes a military member 
is discharged before the end of his term because he has a medical 
condition that existed prior to joining the military, and it’s later deter-
mined that the condition interferes with properly performing military 
duties. Veterans discharged for this reason retain one month’s worth of 
ADMGIB benefits for each month they served on active duty prior to dis-
charge (up to 36 months).
 
✓ Other medical or mental health conditions: Veterans who are dis-
charged early for medical or mental health conditions that interfered with 
their duties are eligible for partial benefits, even if the condition doesn’t 
amount to a disability. Such veterans receive one month’s worth of educa-
tion benefits for each month served on active duty (up to 36 months).
 
✓ Sole survivor: If you were discharged after September 11, 2001, under 
the Sole Survivor program, you’re eligible for one month’s worth of 
education benefits for each month you served on active duty (up to 36 
months). Sole survivors are those who request and receive an honorable 
discharge because they had an immediate family member killed or seri-
ously disabled due to military service.
 
✓ Reduction-in-force (RIF): A RIF can occur if a particular military service 
branch has more people on active duty than the law allows. Only certain 
RIFs qualify for partial benefits. If you were separated due to a reduction-
in-force, check with the VA regional office that serves your state to see if 
you qualify. See Appendix B for VA regional office locations.
 
You must receive an honorable discharge to retain your ADMGIB benefits. See 
the “Checking your discharge characterization” section for more details.
Your reason for discharge can be found on your DD Form 214, Certificate of 
Release or Discharge From Active Duty, in block 23. See Chapter 2 for com-
plete information about the DD Form 214.
 
If you’re currently on active duty and plan to leave early, don’t assume your 
separation reason meets the requirements for the ADMGIB! Check with your 
education services officer or education counselor well in advance of separat-
ing to make sure you don’t lose your ADMGIB benefits!
Officers beware: The effects of commissioning programs
The military services have several programs in which they will pay for your 
college education so you can become a commissioned officer. If you received 
a commission by attending a service academy (such as the U.S. Military 
Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy, or the Air Force Academy), 
you’re not eligible for ADMGIB benefits unless you’re already eligible because 
of prior military service.

176
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
Likewise, if you were commissioned through a Reserve Officer Training Corps 
(ROTC) scholarship program, you’re also ineligible unless your eligibility was 
established by service before you entered the scholarship program.
 
If you received a commission as an ROTC scholarship graduate after 
September 30, 1996, and received $3,400 or less during any one year of your 
scholarship program, you’re still eligible to participate in the ADMGIB.
Knowing your costs: This isn’t a free deal!
To enroll in the ADMGIB, you must agree to give up $1,200 of your military 
pay at the rate of $100 per month for your first 12 months of active-duty ser-
vice. You’re required to make this decision during the first couple of weeks of 
military basic training (or officer accession training).
 
Your decision whether to enroll in the ADMGIB is a one-shot deal. You can’t 
change your mind later. If you elect to enroll in the ADMGIB and later fail 
to qualify (such as if you receive a general discharge), you don’t get your 
$1,200 back.
 
ADMGIB rates are automatically adjusted for inflation at the beginning of each 
fiscal year (October 1). The rates I list in the following sections reflect the 
FY2008 rates which were in effect at the time this book went to press. You 
can find the current rates on the VA’s Web site at www.gibill.va.gov/
GI_Bill_Info/rates.htm.
The effects of college loan repayments
Each of the military services offers a college loan repayment program to 
certain enlistees as an enlistment incentive. Under these programs, the mili-
tary pays all or part of qualifying student loans obtained before joining the 
military. The amounts vary, from a maximum of $65,000 for certain Army and 
Navy active-duty enlistment programs to $10,000 for some Air Force active-
duty enlistments.
Here’s the rub: The law doesn’t allow you to participate in the college loan 
repayment program and qualify for benefits under the ADMGIB during the 
same enlistment period.
To participate in the college loan repayment program, the services require 
recruits in basic training to sign a statement declining participation in the 
ADMGIB. Remember when I said earlier that accepting or declining the 
ADMGIB is a one-shot deal?
However, thousands of service members fell through the cracks. The ser-
vices didn’t require them to sign a statement declining the ADMGIB in basic 
training, and they still participated in the service’s college loan repayment 
program.

177
 Chapter 10: Advancing Your Education through the GI Bill
If you didn’t decline ADMGIB and received loan repayments, you can still be 
eligible for ADMGIB. But the number of months made on your loan repayment 
will be subtracted from your total months of ADMGIB benefits.
The maximum number of months you receive under ADMGIB is 36. So if 
the military service made three annual payments toward your college loan, 
you would have no ADMGIB entitlement. If the military made two annual 
payments toward your loan repayment, you could still have 12 months of 
ADMGIB entitlement.
However, if you received loan repayment for one period of active duty, you 
can still be eligible for up to 36 months of benefits based on a second period 
of active duty as long as you haven’t declined ADMGIB.
Deciphering entitlements and rates
I think that to work for the federal government, employees must take a 
special course in how to make things sound more complicated than they 
actually are.
When the VA explains ADMGIB rates, they use the term entitlement to mean 
the number of months of benefits you may receive. Under the ADMGIB, you’re 
entitled to 36 months worth of full-time benefits at the rate of $1,321 per 
month (if your active-duty contract was for three or more years) or $1,073 per 
month (for those who joined for less than three years of active duty).
If you go to college full time and receive $1,321 ($1,073), you use one month’s 
worth of entitlement. If you go to college half time, you receive half of the 
maximum monthly amount, or $660.50 ($536.50), and use a half month’s 
entitlement.
In other words, if you attend college full time, you receive the full monthly 
benefit for each month you attend courses, up to 36 months. If you attend 
college half time, you receive half of the full monthly benefits each month for 
up to 72 months. If you attend college one quarter of the time, you receive 
one quarter of the maximum monthly benefit for up to 144 months.
Good thing I don’t work for the federal government. There’s a much simpler 
way to look at it: If you served active duty for three or more years, your 
ADMGIB benefit totals $47,556. If your active-duty contract was for less 
than three years, your benefits total $38,628. When you go to college, you’ll 
receive a monthly amount, as explained in the following section. When you’ve 
used up all the money, your benefits stop. Simple, huh?
Rates for institutional training
When the VA talks about paying for education at a college or university, it 
refers to rates for “institutional training.” Sounds like you’ve been committed 
to an asylum, doesn’t it? Come to think of it, many colleges could probably be 
considered asylums, especially if you live in the dormitories.

178
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
Table 10-1 shows the monthly ADMGIB benefit for those attending colleges 
and universities. For the latest rates, check out the VA’s Web site at www.
gibill.va.gov/GI_Bill_Info/rates.htm.

Note: When you enroll at less than half time, you’re reimbursed only for 
tuition and fees, up to the maximum monthly amounts shown in Table 10-1. 
When you enroll at least half time, you’re paid the monthly amount shown, 
regardless of the cost of your college courses.
Full time means taking at least 12 credit hours in a term, or 24 clock hours 
per week. Three-quarters time is defined as at least 9 credit hours in a term, 
or 18 clock hours per week. Half time means taking at least 6 credit hours in 
a term, or 12 clock hours per week. One-quarter time means taking at least 3 
credit hours in a term, or 6 clock hours per week.
 
The rates shown in the table are for veterans using their ADMGIB benefits 
after they leave the military. Using the ADMGIB while still on active duty pays 
substantially less, as explained in the “Using the program while still in the mili-
tary: Not a good deal” section later in this chapter.
Rates for apprenticeship and on-the-job training
The ADMGIB also pays for apprenticeship and on-the-job training programs 
(see the section “The GI Bill Is a Terrible Thing to Waste: Where You Can Use 
It” later in the chapter for details). However, these benefits are less than the 
amount paid for attending college full time (see the preceding section). Rates 
as of late 2008 are shown in Table 10-2. (For rate updates, go to the VA’s Web 
site at www.gibill.va.gov/GI_Bill_Info/rates.htm.)

Correspondence courses, tests for licenses 
or certifications, and flight training
In these cyberspace days, I doubt that very many people study by mail 
anymore. But if you choose to do so, the ADMGIB will pay for 55 percent of 
the approved charges for the course, up to your ADMGIB entitlement (see 
the “Deciphering entitlements and rates” section for the specific amounts). 
Payments for correspondence courses are made quarterly (every three 
months), instead of monthly.
If you require a license or certification, such as a state teaching certification, 
to get a job, the ADMGIB will pay up to $2,000 for each test or certification, 
up to your ADMGIB entitlement. There is no limit to the number of tests or 
re-tests you can take. However, the ADMGIB doesn’t pay for tests (or college 
courses) that you fail, nor does it pay for license renewals.
Unfortunately, the ADMGIB won’t pay for you to obtain your private pilot 
license. However, the program will make monthly payments based on 60 per-
cent of the approved charges for advanced flight training courses, such as a 
commercial flight license, instrument rating, instructor pilot rating, and so 
on, up to the maximum monthly amounts shown in Table 10-2.
 
Before taking flight training, tests for licenses or certifications, or costly high-
tech programs, consider carefully your remaining entitlement to ADMGIB ben-
efits. For example, assume you have ten months ($13,210) of ADMGIB benefits 
remaining, and you decide to enroll in flight training for an instrument rating 
and commercial pilot license. The total cost of the approved course charges is 
$20,210. Sixty percent of the approved charges is $12,126. Your ADMGIB would 
pay $13,210 (10 × $1,321). You would have to pay the remaining $6,790 out of 
your own pocket. Can you say “ouch”?

180
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
Getting the most for your money: Increases above the basic rates
Two programs allow active-duty members to increase their ADMGIB benefits:
 
✓ The contribution program: Members on active duty can contribute up 
to an additional $600 to their ADMGIB. For every $20 you contribute, you 
receive an additional $5 on your monthly ADMGIB full-time rate. If you’re 
eligible for the maximum 36 months of ADMGIB benefits, contributing 
the total $600 increases your total benefit by $5,400.
 
 You must make these contributions while you’re on active duty. Neither 
VA nor the military can collect them after you’ve left active duty.
 
✓ The College Fund: Many of the services offer a college fund as an enlist-
ment incentive. Usually, to be eligible for a college fund, you must agree 
to enlist in a critical occupation specialty. A critical occupation specialty 
is a military job that your service branch considers to be critically 
undermanned. Each recruiting service maintains its own listing of criti-
cal occupation specialties. The amount of the fund varies according 
to the current occupational needs of the service, but it can range from 
$5,000 to $50,000. You don’t receive your College Fund money in one 
lump-sum payment. Instead, it’s divided into monthly payments that are 
added to your basic ADMGIB rate. It’s prorated for part-time training, 
just as the basic ADMGIB benefit is.
 
 You can’t receive your College Fund money without receiving the 
ADMGIB. The college fund isn’t a separate benefit, but an add-on, or 
kicker, to your ADMGIB benefit.
 
 If you lose eligibility to the ADMGIB, you also lose the college fund! 
Check with your education service officer or education counselor before 
separating to make sure you don’t lose your ADMGIB (including College 
Fund) eligibility!
You aren’t limited to one type of increase. For example, if eligible, you can 
receive both the College Fund money and the increase based on contributions.
Using the program while still in 
the military: Not a good deal
You can begin using your ADMGIB benefits while still in the military for off-duty 
college courses. To be eligible, you must first complete two years of active-
duty service. However, going to college on the ADMGIB while still on active 
duty is not a wise move because your benefits are reduced dramatically.
For active-duty members going to school, the VA only pays the cost of tuition 
and fees (up to your allowed monthly amount). However, if tuition and fees 
for the course cost less than your monthly benefit, the VA subtracts the entire 
maximum monthly amount from your benefit entitlements.

181
 Chapter 10: Advancing Your Education through the GI Bill
For example, assume you’re enrolled in three college courses (a total of 9 
credit hours) for a three-month term. The tuition and fee costs for the three 
courses total $1,500. If you use your ADMGIB benefits for these courses after 
you get out of the military, you would receive a total of $2,972.25 from your 
ADMGIB benefits (three-quarter enrollment at a rate of $990.75 per month for 
three months). If you take these same courses while still on active duty, the VA 
only reimburses $1,500 (the cost of tuition and fees), but $2,972.25 is still sub-
tracted from your ADMGIB benefits. Now that’s a bum deal if I ever heard one!
 
You don’t have to use your ADMGIB entitlements to attend college while still 
on active duty. Each of the services has a tuition assistance program, which 
pays 100 percent of tuition (up to $250 per semester hour and $4,500 per year) 
for college courses taken by military members on active duty. For this reason, 
most active-duty members use tuition assistance while still in the military and 
save their ADMGIB benefits for after they separate from the service.
Transferring your benefits
In 2001, Congress amended the ADMGIB law to allow the individual active-
duty branches to let their members transfer up to half of their ADMGIB ben-
efits to their spouses and/or dependent children. Congress didn’t mandate 
the establishment of such programs, but allowed the services to do so if they 
wished.
In 2002, the Air Force offered a pilot (meaning trial, not someone who flies 
a plane) program for transferring ADMGIB benefits to a spouse and/or chil-
dren. The program was available to a limited number of participants and was 
ended in 2003.
At press time, the Army is the only branch with an ADMGIB transfer program. 
It implemented the transfer of entitlement option effective July 21, 2006. The 
Army is offering transfer of entitlement as a reenlistment incentive option 
for service members reenlisting after 6 years of service and with less than 14 
years of service. The Army’s program allows for transfer of entitlement to an 
individual’s spouse only and doesn’t allow transfer to dependent children.
Under an Army test program, effective November 1, 2007, certain enlisted 
soldiers can transfer up to 18 months of their ADMGIB to their spouse and/or 
dependent children. To be eligible, the soldier must have served at least six 
years on active duty and agree to reenlist for at least four years in an occupa-
tional field that the Army considers critical.
For many years, Congress has debated requiring all the military branches 
to develop programs for transferring benefits, but that’s now a dead issue 
because the new GI Bill of the 21st Century makes such a requirement. 
Therefore, Congress is unlikely to make further changes to the ADMGIB.

182
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
GI Bills aren’t forever: 
Expiration of benefits
Your eligibility for the ADMGIB (including the College Fund if you qualify for 
it) generally ends ten years from the date of your last separation from active 
duty, or when you use all your months of entitlement, whichever is earlier.
The VA can extend your ten-year period by the amount of time you were 
prevented from taking classes during that period because of a disability or 
because you were held by a foreign government or power.
The VA can also extend your ten-year period if you reenter active duty for 90 
continuous days or more (not counting any period of active duty for train-
ing). Your new ten-year eligibility period begins after your last separation 
from active duty.
If you serve two or more years on active duty and serve four or more years in 
the Selected Reserve, you have ten years from your release from active duty 
or ten years from the completion of the four-year Selected Reserve obligation 
to use your benefits, whichever is later.
If your benefits expire but you still have ADMGIB money available while still 
attending school, the VA can extend your entitlement to the end of a term, 
quarter, or semester if the ending date of your entitlement falls within a 
term, quarter, or semester. If the school doesn’t operate on a term basis and 
you’ve completed at least one-half of your program, the VA can extend your 
entitlement for 12 weeks.
The Selected Reserve Montgomery 
GI Bill: A Free Cash Cow
The Reserve GI Bill, otherwise known as the Selected Reserve Montgomery 
GI Bill (SRMGIB), is an educational assistance program enacted by Congress 
in 1984 to attract high-quality men and women into the Reserve branch of 
the armed forces. This program is for members of the Selected Reserve of 
the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, and the Army and 
Air National Guard. The SRMGIB doesn’t require service in the active armed 
forces to qualify.
 
The ADMGIB is being phased out, in favor of the new GI Bill of the 21st Century 
(for details, see the “GI Bill of the 21st Century” section later in this chapter). 
Active-duty recruits who enlist on or after August 1, 2009, will no longer be eli-
gible for the ADMGIB. At press time, there has still been no announcement as 
to whether the SRMGIB will follow suit. Because the SRMGIB doesn’t require 

183
 Chapter 10: Advancing Your Education through the GI Bill
any active-duty time to participate, and the new GI Bill of the 21st Century 
requires at least 90 days of active duty in order to be eligible, there’s a good 
chance that the SRMGIB will remain.
Eligibility: Who can play 
on this ball field?
A primary difference between the ADMGIB and the SRMGIB is that while the 
VA determines benefit eligibility for those who participate in the active-duty 
program, the agency does not determine eligibility for the SRMGIB.
Your Reserve or Guard component determines your eligibility and, if you 
qualify, will code your eligibility into the Department of Defense (DOD) per-
sonnel system. The VA makes the payments, but it can’t pay benefits without 
eligibility information from your Reserve or Guard component.
Here are the eligibility requirements you must meet to qualify for SRMGIB 
benefits:
 
✓ Service commitment: You must enter into a six-year obligation to serve 
in the Selected Reserve. If you’re an officer, you must agree to serve 
six years in addition to any service obligation you agreed to when you 
became an officer.
 
✓ Selected Reserve status: To use your benefits, you must serve in a drilling 
Selected Reserve unit and remain in good standing (by participating in 
all required weekend drills and training periods). If your component noti-
fies you that you have failed to participate satisfactorily in the Selected 
Reserve, your eligibility is suspended. It can be restored only when your 
component determines that you have participated satisfactorily.
 
✓ Military scholarships: You can’t receive the SRMGIB when you’re receiv-
ing a scholarship through the Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps 
(SROTC) program to become an active-duty officer. If you receive only a 
monthly stipend (versus a scholarship), you’re still eligible for SRMGIB 
benefits. If you receive an ROTC scholarship under section 2107a of Title 
10, U.S. Code, you’re still eligible for the SRMGIB. Individuals receiving 
this type of ROTC scholarship agree to serve as officers in either the 
Army Reserve or the Army National Guard.
 
 Interestingly, although officers who graduate from military service acad-
emies are ineligible for active-duty MGIB benefits, nothing in the law 
makes them ineligible for the SRMGIB.
 
✓ Active Guard and Reserve: Your SRMGIB benefits are suspended if you 
enter AGR (Active Guard and Reserve) status. You can resume SRMGIB 
eligibility after your AGR status ends if you return to the Selected 
Reserve within one year. You can be eligible for the ADMGIB based on 
your AGR service.

184
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
 
If you disagree with a decision about your basic eligibility, the VA can’t help 
you. You must contact your Reserve or Guard unit’s education officer for 
assistance.
Rates: Pays less, but heck, it’s free
The great news for Reservists is that you don’t have to pay anything to par-
ticipate in the SRMGIB (unlike the ADMGIB, which requires a reduction in pay 
of $1,200). On the negative side, the reserve program pays significantly less 
than the active-duty program.
You’re entitled to 36 months of full-time education benefits under the 
SRMGIB, at the rate of $329 per month, which means you can receive up to 
$11,844 toward your college education.
 
SRMGIB rates are automatically adjusted for inflation at the beginning of each 
fiscal year (October 1). The rates I include in the following sections reflect the 
FY2008 rates, which were in effect when this book went to press. You can find 
the current rates on the VA’s Web site at www.gibill.va.gov/GI_Bill_
Info/rates.htm.
Institutional training
What you and I would call traditional attendance at a four-year college or 
university, the VA calls “institutional training.” But who cares what it’s called 
when the government is willing to pay for it, right? Table 10-3 shows the 
monthly benefit rates for SRMGIB participants who are enrolled in college or 
university courses.
Table 10-3 
SRMGIB Education Rates (Effective October 1, 2008)
Training Time
Monthly Rate
Full time
$329.00
Three-quarters time
$246.00
Half time
$163.00
Less than half time
$82.25
Full time means taking at least 12 credit hours in a term, or 24 clock hours per week. Three-quarters time 
is defined as at least 9 credit hours in a term, or 18 clock hours per week. Half time means taking at least 6 
credit hours in a term, or 12 clock hours per week.
As with the ADMGIB, you are charged for a month of entitlement for each month 
of full-time benefits you receive. If you attend school part time, the VA adjusts 
your entitlement charge according to your course load. For example, if you 
receive full-time benefits for 12 months, the charge is 12 months of entitlement. 
If you receive half-time benefits for 12 months, the charge is only 6 months.

185
 Chapter 10: Advancing Your Education through the GI Bill
Apprenticeship and on-the-job training
You can use your SRMGIB benefits to pay for apprenticeship and on-the-job 
training programs. The amount of benefits you receive depends on what 
stage of the program you’re in, as shown in Table 10-4.
Table 10-4 
Apprenticeship and On-the-job Training Rates 
 
(Effective October 1, 2008)
Training Period
Monthly Rates
First six months of training
$246.75
Second six months of training
$180.95
Remaining pursuit of training
$115.15
Correspondence courses, tests for licenses 
or certifications, and flight training
Just like the ADMGIB, you can use the SRMGIB to enroll in correspondence 
courses. The SRMGIB will pay for 55 percent of the approved charges for the 
course, up to your SRMGIB entitlement.
In January 2006, Congress amended the law to allow participants in the 
SRMGIB to be reimbursed for approved licenses or certifications. Prior to 
this, only those in the active-duty program could use this benefit.
You can receive reimbursement from your SRMGIB entitlement for the cost 
of a license or certification test, up to $2,000 per test. You may take as many 
tests as you need, and you don’t have to pass a test to receive benefits. You 
can receive benefits to retake a test you failed and to renew or update your 
license or certificate.
The SRMGIB won’t pay for you to get a private pilot’s license. But if you 
already have a license, the SRMGIB will pay up to 60 percent of approved 
advanced flight training (up to your SRMGIB entitlement), such as commer-
cial flight license, instrument rating, instructor pilot rating, and so on, up to 
the maximum monthly amounts shown in Table 10-4.
Patience, Grasshopper: When you 
can start using the benefits
You officially become eligible for the SRMGIB and can begin using the ben-
efits when you complete initial entry training for the Selected Reserves. Your 
training generally is considered complete after you finish basic training and 
school for your military job, and return to your unit for monthly drills.

186
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
 
Some people join the National Guard or Reserves under a program called split 
option. Under this program, a person enlists in the National Guard or Reserves, 
attends basic training, and then returns to drill with her unit for up to one 
year before attending military job training. If you enlisted under this program, 
you’re not entitled to SRMGIB benefits until you’ve completed the job portion 
of your military training.
Converting to the Active-Duty GI Bill
If you’re called up to active duty under Title 10 of the United States Code 
(federal duty), you can convert your SRMGIB benefits to the ADMGIB, as long 
as you’re called up for two years or more and you don’t decline the ADMGIB 
in writing. Of course, if you elect this option, you have to request it (see 
your local education office) and agree to have your pay reduced by $100 per 
month for your first 12 months of active-duty service. (To find out the details 
of the ADMGIB, check out the earlier section “Getting Cash for College: The 
Active-Duty GI Bill.”)
A call-up to full-time National Guard duty under Title 32, U.S. Code (state 
authority) won’t qualify you for the ADMGIB, unless the purpose of the 
duty is for organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the 
National Guard. Duty under Title 32, U.S. Code for the purpose of performing 
operations (such as drug interdiction or disaster relief) isn’t qualifying duty 
for the ADMGIB.
When time runs out: Expiration of benefits
In most cases, you must use your SRMGIB while you’re still in the Selected 
Reserves. If you leave the Selected Reserves, generally your benefits end 
the day you separate. However, there are a couple of exceptions to this 
general rule.
If you leave the Selected Reserve and you meet the following requirements, 
you generally are still eligible for a full 14 years from the date you became 
eligible:
 
✓ You were separated because you had a disability that wasn’t caused by 
misconduct, or
 
✓ Your unit was inactivated or you were otherwise involuntarily separated 
between October 1, 1991, and December 31, 2001.
Even if you stay in the Selected Reserves, there is a time limit for using your 
SRMGIB benefits. Your benefits expire 14 years from your eligibility date.

187
 Chapter 10: Advancing Your Education through the GI Bill
If you stay in the Selected Reserves and you’re called up for federal active 
duty under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, the VA will extend your eligibility for the 
length of your active duty, plus four months. You’ll receive a separate exten-
sion for each call-up. Unfortunately, the law doesn’t permit the VA to grant 
extensions for call-ups under Title 32 (state authority).
Additionally, the VA can extend your eligibility if it expires while you’re 
enrolled in classes or a program. Eligibility is usually extended to the end of a 
term, quarter, or semester. If the school doesn’t operate on a term basis, the 
VA can generally extend your eligibility for 12 weeks.
Finally, the VA can extend your eligibility if you couldn’t train because of a 
disability caused by Selected Reserves service.
The GI Bill of the 21st Century
If you’re a veteran with at least 90 days of active-duty service after September 
11, 2001, have I got great news for you! On June 20, 2008, Congress stopped 
bickering long enough to pass a new GI Bill with significantly expanded ben-
efits, including up to 100 percent tuition, payment for books and fees, and 
even a monthly housing allowance while you attend college!
Congress is calling this the GI Bill of the 21st Century (GIB21C), and it goes 
into effect August 1, 2009. Actually, the new program is technically in effect 
now, but Congress has given the VA until August 1, 2009, to come up with the 
new rate tables.
The GIB21C doesn’t change where or how education benefits can be used 
(see the “The GI Bill Is a Terrible Thing to Waste: Where You Can Use It” 
section later in this chapter), but boy, oh, boy does it change the amount of 
money available to you for your education.
 
The new law requires the military services to establish a program to allow 
military members to transfer a portion of their GI Bill benefits to their spouses 
or dependent children. However, the law doesn’t go into specifics. How vari-
ous military service branches will implement this provision is still unknown at 
press time. Most likely, you’ll be required to reenlist to be eligible to transfer 
benefits.
Claiming what’s yours: Eligibility
You’re eligible for the new benefit if you have performed active-duty service 
after September 11, 2001, for

188
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
 
✓ At least 90 continuous days, or
 
✓ Six or more months of total days
If you have post-9/11 active-duty service of less than 24 months, you can’t use 
your initial entry training (IET) time to qualify. IET active duty means active 
duty you performed in basic training or initial military job training school. If 
you have 24 or more months of post-9/11 active-duty service, your time in IET 
does count when computing benefit entitlement and how much you’ll receive 
(see the upcoming “Post-9/11 active-duty time” section).
Good news for officers: Everyone who meets the post-9/11 active-duty 
requirements is eligible for the GIB21C. However, officers can’t use their 
active-duty time while in initial training status to qualify. (Under the ADMGIB, 
officers who obtained their commission through a military service academy 
or ROTC scholarship weren’t eligible, unless they qualified for benefits for 
previous active-duty service.)
 
As with the ADMGIB and the SRMGIB, you must first have a high school 
diploma or GED to begin using benefits under the GIB21C.
No more contributions
Unlike the ADMGIB, you don’t have to contribute $1,200 of your military pay 
to participate in the new program. If you’re currently on active duty and 
paying into the ADMGIB, you can stop. You’ll still be eligible for the GIB21C 
program on August 1, 2009 (assuming you have the prerequisite active-duty 
time; see the earlier “Claiming what’s yours: Eligibility” section).
Unfortunately, the new law doesn’t provide for refunds. If you’ve already con-
tributed to the ADMGIB, you won’t get your money back.
Converting to the new GI Bill
If, on August 1, 2009, you are eligible for the ADMGIB and/or the SRMGIB and 
you qualify for the GIB21C, you may make an irrevocable election to receive 
benefits under the GIB21C. After you elect to receive benefits under the 
GIB21C, you’re no longer eligible to receive benefits under the program(s) 
from which you elected the GIB21C.
 
Before you elect to convert, carefully consider your education objectives and 
how you plan to achieve them. For example, if you plan to receive your degree 
online, the ADMGIB may actually pay more. That’s because the GIB21C doesn’t 
pay the housing allowance component for online education.

189
 Chapter 10: Advancing Your Education through the GI Bill
Assuming you’re eligible for the new program and you elect to convert, you 
only receive the number of months of education benefits you had available 
under your old program. For example, if you have 22 months of ADMGIB 
benefits remaining at the time you convert, you would receive 22 months of 
benefits under the new program.
Entitlements: More cash for college
Your education benefits under the GIB21C vary, according to several factors, 
but — on the whole — the new program pays a whole lot more than does the 
ADMGIB and SRMGIB.
Like the other GI Bill programs, you’re entitled to 36 months of full-time edu-
cation benefits. If you go to school half time, you’d receive 72 months of half 
benefits.
 
If you’ve already used some of your benefits under the ADMGIB or SRMGIB, 
the amount will be subtracted from your total benefits when you convert to 
the GIB21C. For example, if you’ve already used 12 months of your ADMGIB 
benefits, you will have only 24 months of GIB21C benefits when you convert.
Post-9/11 active-duty time
The percentage of the total authorized benefits you receive depends on the 
amount of post-9/11 active-duty time you have under your belt. The percent-
ages are
 
✓ 100 percent for 36 or more total months
 
✓ 100 percent for 30 or more consecutive days with a disability-related 
discharge
 
✓ 90 percent for 30 total months
 
✓ 80 percent for 24 total months
 
✓ 70 percent for 18 total months
 
✓ 60 percent for 12 total months
 
✓ 50 percent for 6 total months
 
✓ 40 percent for 90 or more consecutive days
Tuition
The GIB21C pays 100 percent of the full tuition rate set by your state for 
public schools (subject to the percentage restrictions shown in the preced-
ing section). An added feature of this tuition payment plan is that the tuition 
will be paid directly to the school, relieving you of the responsibility.

190
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
At press time, the tuition rates weren’t available because the VA has until 
August 1, 2009, to produce tuition rate charts for each state. When available, 
you can view the rates on the VA’s GI Bill Web site at www.gibill.va.gov.
Books and fees
The GIB21C pays $1,000 per academic year for books and fees (subject to the 
percentage restrictions shown in the “Post-9/11 active-duty time” section). 
You’ll receive a lump-sum payment the first month of each quarter, semester, 
or term, depending on how your school divides the academic year.
Housing stipend
A very attractive feature of the new GI Bill is payment of a monthly housing 
stipend. Subject to the percentage restrictions shown in the “Post-9/11 active-
duty time” section, the amount payable is the same as the housing allowance 
given to active-duty enlistment members in the pay grade of E-5 at the “with 
dependent” rate. The military’s active-duty housing allowance depends on 
location, and it changes each January 1, depending on the rise or fall of aver-
age housing costs. Current rates can be found on the Department of Defense 
Per Diem Web site at perdiem.hqda.pentagon.mil/perdiem/bah.html.
The average housing allowance for an E-5 with dependents in 2008 was $1,400 
per month.
 
Veterans who attend school through distance learning don’t receive the hous-
ing stipend. Additionally, military members who use the benefit while still on 
active duty don’t receive the housing stipend because their housing needs are 
already being taken care of by the military.
More time to use the benefits
The ADMGIB expires ten years after your last discharge from the military. 
The SRMGIB expires upon your discharge from the Reserves. If you’re eligible 
for the new GI Bill, you retain your benefits until you use them up or for 15 
years after your last discharge from the military, whichever occurs first.
The GI Bill Is a Terrible Thing to 
Waste: Where You Can Use It
You can use your GI Bill benefits to pay for almost any education program 
that leads to an accredited college degree or to an occupational objective.

191
 Chapter 10: Advancing Your Education through the GI Bill
 
Benefits under the new GIB21C can only be used for programs offered by 
schools in the United States that are authorized to grant an associate’s degree 
or higher. That means, for example, you can’t use the new program to pay for 
overseas college educations, nor for apprenticeship and on-the-job training 
programs, unless those programs are offered by a degree-granting institution 
in the United States. The ADMGIB and the SRMGIB can often be used for these 
purposes. This is another factor you should consider before deciding whether 
to convert to the GIB21C.
The programs listed here are examples of the types of approved training pro-
grams for which GI Bill benefits are payable:
 
✓ An undergraduate or graduate degree at a college or university, including
 
• An accredited independent study program (which may be offered 
through distance education) leading to a standard college degree.
 
• A cooperative (co-op) training program (a full-time program alter-
nating school instruction and job training in a business or indus-
trial establishment).
 
✓ A certificate or diploma from a business, technical, or vocational school, 
including co-op programs.
 
✓ An accredited independent study course leading to a certificate from a 
college, university, or other degree-granting educational institution.
 
✓ An apprenticeship or on-the-job training (OJT) program offered by a 
company or union. Apprenticeships or OJT programs offer an alterna-
tive to college or vocational school for helping you gain experience in 
the field you choose.
 
✓ A correspondence course.
 
✓ Flight training. You must have a private pilot certificate and meet the 
medical requirements for the desired certificate when you begin training.
 
✓ Qualified programs overseas that lead to a college degree.
 
A state agency or the VA must approve each program offered by a school or 
company.
Although the GI Bills can be used to pay for a variety of education and train-
ing programs, there are certain restrictions on where or how the benefits can 
be used. You may not receive benefits for the following courses:
 
✓ Bartending and personality development courses
 
✓ Nonaccredited independent study courses
 
✓ Any course given by radio

192
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
 
✓ Self-improvement courses such as reading, speaking, woodworking, 
basic seamanship, and English as a second language
 
✓ Farm cooperative courses
 
✓ Audited courses
 
✓ Courses paid in whole or in part by the military tuition assistance or 
other armed forces program
 
✓ Courses that are recreational in character
 
✓ Courses that don’t lead to an educational, professional, or vocational 
objective
 
✓ Courses you’ve taken before and successfully completed
 
✓ Courses you take as a federal employee under the Government 
Employees’ Training Act
In addition to the course restrictions, you can’t use the ADMGIB or SRMGIB 
under the following circumstances:
 
✓ Imprisonment: Individuals who are in a federal, state, or local prison 
after being convicted of a felony may receive only the cost of tuition, 
fees, necessary books, equipment, and supplies (up to your maximum 
monthly entitlement). I guess Congress figured that’s all you need if 
you’re in prison, because your bed and breakfast are already being 
taken care of.
 
✓ Denial of admission to degree program: If you seek a college degree, 
the school must admit you to a degree program by the start of your 
third term.
 
✓ Position of influence at a proprietary school: You can’t use VA educa-
tion benefits if you’re an owner or official of the school.
 
✓ Fugitive felon status: The VA can’t pay education benefits for any period 
during which federal or state law enforcement identifies you as a fugi-
tive felon. A person is considered a fugitive felon if he has an outstanding 
warrant for a felony.
Dual Duty: Combining the GI Bills
If you’re eligible for both the ADMGIB and the SRMGIB, you may receive a 
maximum of 48 months of benefits. However, you can’t use both benefits at 
the same time. You must choose which program you want to use.

193
 Chapter 10: Advancing Your Education through the GI Bill
For example, if you’re eligible for both benefits and elect to use the ADMGIB, 
you would have 12 months of SRMGIB benefits remaining when your ADMGIB 
benefits are used up.
You can’t combine the ADMGIB or the SRMGIB with the new GIB21C. 
However, you can convert any remaining entitlements under the ADMGIB 
and/or the SRMGIB to GIB21C benefits. See the “Converting to the new GI Bill” 
section earlier in this chapter.
Get That Cap and Gown Ready: 
Applying for the Benefits
Applying for ADMGIB, SRMGIB, and GIB21C benefits is rather easy, consider-
ing this is a program administered by the federal government. Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Find out if the program you want to participate in is approved for VA 
education benefits.
 
 You can check with the school’s financial aid office or training facility 
employment office, or contact the VA (see Appendix B). If the facility 
hasn’t requested approval before, ask the school or training facility offi-
cial to contact the VA to request approval.
 
2. Complete VA Form 22-1990 and submit it to the appropriate VA 
regional office (see Appendix B).
 
 You can get the application form in several ways:
 
• If the school or facility you want to attend is already approved 
for VA education benefits, the financial aid office will likely have 
copies.
 
• You can also get the form online. Just go to www.gibill.va.gov 
and click “Education Benefits,” then “How to Apply for Benefits.” 
From here, you can print the form and mail it, or you can fill it out 
online and submit it electronically.
 
 If you apply online, you must still print the signature page and 
send it to the VA, because the agency needs your original signature 
to begin payments. If you’re on active duty, your education ser-
vices officer must also sign your application.
 
• You can call 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551) and request an applica-
tion. (You may have difficulty getting through quickly, especially 
when school enrollments are heavy. You may have more success 
by going to the Internet site.)

194
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
 
3. Ask the school or training official to certify your enrollment to VA.
 
 If the program has been approved for VA benefits, check in with the 
school or training facility official who certifies enrollments for VA ben-
efits. At a school, this certifying official may be in one of the following 
offices: financial aid, veterans affairs, registrar, admissions, counseling, 
or others. For on-the-job training or an apprenticeship, the official may 
be in the training, finance, personnel, or other office.
 
 The certifying official at the school or education facility isn’t a VA 
employee and can’t make decisions about your eligibility for VA benefits.
 
4. The VA will review your application and let you know whether any-
thing else is needed to begin payments.
 
If you haven’t decided on a program or simply want a determination of 
your eligibility for the GI Bill, just submit the application to the appropriate 
VA regional office. If you’re eligible, you’ll receive a Certificate of Eligibility 
showing how long you’re eligible and how many months of benefits you can 
receive. See Appendix B for VA regional office locations.

Chapter 11
Aid and Vocational Training for 
Disabled and Homeless Veterans
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing what Chapter 31 benefits are available
▶ Getting a little help with expenses
▶ Applying for benefits
▶ Providing help for homeless veterans
I
f you’re a military veteran who has a disability that was caused or aggra-
vated by your military service, and your disability prevents you from land-
ing a steady job, don’t despair (for too long, anyway). The U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) has a program designed to fit your needs.
The VA has helped thousands of disabled veterans prepare for and find jobs. 
It can help you determine what kind of job you’re best suited for, assist you 
in preparing your resume and applying for jobs, and — in certain cases — 
even pay for you to get a college degree or receive job-related training in 
order to become employable. In some cases, the VA even helps pay your 
living expenses while you’re improving your mind in a training program.
In addition to helping disabled veterans, Congress has established several 
programs within the VA to address homelessness among veterans. The 
primary goal for these programs is to return homeless veterans to self-
sufficiency and stable independent living. The VA provides healthcare to 
about 100,000 homeless veterans, and compensation and pensions to nearly 
40,000 annually. The department also offers homeless veterans employment 
assistance and help obtaining foreclosed homes and excess federal property, 
including clothes, footwear, blankets, and other items. In this chapter, I 
give you an overview of who the homeless veterans are and explain available 
programs and what they provide.

196
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
 
In addition to the programs detailed in this chapter, many states operate 
separate programs to assist homeless veterans. For details, contact the 
appropriate state veterans affairs office (see Appendix A).
The Chapter 31 Program: What It Offers
The VA’s Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) Program helps 
veterans who have service-connected disabilities get and keep a job. The 
program has placed vets in positions ranging from sales associate at the 
mega-superstore up the road to production manager at an international 
corporation. The program is a result of a law enacted by Congress under 
Title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 31. Because of this, the 
program is commonly referred to as the Chapter 31 Program.
The program offers a variety of services that can help fit you into the right 
job, including:
 
✓ Interest and aptitude testing: Remember when you took the Armed 
Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) when you first joined the 
military? That test measured your aptitude for learning various military 
jobs. The VA offers a similar test that can tell you where your aptitude 
lies in civilian job fields. Who knows? Maybe you have the makings of an 
electronic engineer!
 
✓ Occupational exploration: There are thousands of jobs out there in job 
land. The VA can help you explore those opportunities to determine 
what the qualifications are, where the jobs are located, how much they 
pay, and what particular fields have the greatest need.
 
✓ Setting occupational goals: Sometimes you may know what kind of 
career you want, but you may not know how to get from here to there. 
The VA can help you establish a set of goals, ultimately leading to your 
dream job.
 
✓ Locating the right type of training program: You may require additional 
training to qualify for your career choice. The VA can help you deter-
mine the training program that is best suited to your needs and capabili-
ties. In some cases, the VA can even pay for your tuition and fees.
 
✓ Exploring education and training facilities: After you know the type 
of training program you require, the next step is finding a school or 
training facility that offers what you need. The VA can help you locate 
schools that fit your budget, time, location, and capabilities to achieve 
your occupational goal.

197
 Chapter 11: Aid and Vocational Training for Disabled and Homeless Veterans
Examining Your Eligibility 
for Chapter 31
 
Not all veterans are eligible for the Chapter 31 Program (see the previous 
section for details on this program). In fact, you may meet the basic eligibility 
criteria but still not be entitled to benefits under the VR&E program. Even if 
the VA finds you’re entitled to other benefits under the program (I list these 
additional benefits in the “Using Benefits beyond Education and Training” 
section later in this chapter), a counselor may decide you’re not entitled to 
vocational training or education. I cover this in more detail in the “Knowing 
what you’re entitled to,” section a little later in this chapter.
Meeting the basic requirements
Three factors determine whether you meet the basic eligibility requirements 
to participate in the VR&E program:
 
✓ Service characterization: You must have been discharged (or will soon 
be discharged) from the military under circumstances that the VA 
doesn’t determine to be dishonorable. See Chapter 2 for information 
about how the VA makes this determination.
 
✓ Disability rating: The VA must have awarded you a disability rating of at 
least 10 percent. If you have not yet been discharged from the military, 
your expected disability rating must be at least 20 percent. Additionally, 
the disability must be service-connected (a result of your military ser-
vice). Read Chapter 6 for more information about VA disability ratings.
 
✓ Time period: You have a limited time in which you can apply for bene-
fits under the VR&E program. This is generally 12 years from the date 
the VA notified you that you had at least a 10 percent service-connected 
disability.
Knowing what you’re entitled to
After you submit your application (see “Applying for Chapter 31 Benefits” 
later in this chapter), you meet with a VA vocational rehabilitation counselor 
(VRC) who determines if you’re entitled to program benefits.

198
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
In order to be entitled to benefits, the VRC must find that you have at least 
a 20 percent service-connected disability with an employment handicap, 
or you have at least a 10 percent service-connected disability with a serious 
employment handicap. Here’s how the VA defines these two terms:
 
✓ Employment handicap: This means your disability impairs your ability 
to get a job in the field where your interests, experience, and aptitude 
lie. Your disability may not preclude you from all employment in this 
field, but it may limit advancements and promotions, or impact your 
ability to perform some tasks in the field.
 
✓ Serious employment handicap: Your disability severely limits or com-
pletely prevents you from obtaining employment in the job field that you 
have experience, training, and aptitude in.
I know these definitions sound subjective. That’s because they are. There 
isn’t any go/no-go list that the VRC uses to establish your degree of employ-
ment handicap. Each and every case is evaluated on an individual basis. The 
VRC uses many individual factors, including the exact nature of the disability, 
your previous training and work experience, your interests and occupational 
goals, and so on, in establishing your degree of employment handicap. Of 
course, like most VA programs, if you disagree with the VRC’s determination, 
you can file an appeal. Chapter 3 includes information about filing an appeal.
 
Although the VRC determines your degree of employment handicap, your 
disability rating and whether it’s service connected are established by the VA 
under a separate process. I discuss disability rates and service connection in 
Chapter 6.
I’m afraid that’s not the end of it. Even if the VRC determines that you’re enti-
tled to benefits under Chapter 31, she may determine that you don’t require 
education or vocational training programs to become employable. In that 
case, you’d be entitled to other benefits under the VR&E program, including 
vocational counseling, rehabilitation planning, and job referral services. See 
the “Using Benefits beyond Education and Training” section later in this 
chapter.
Footing the Bill: What the VA Pays For
Assuming the VRC determines you’re entitled to Chapter 31 benefits and that 
you require education or vocational training to help you become employable 
(see the previous sections), the VA will pay for a variety of education and 
training programs.

199
 Chapter 11: Aid and Vocational Training for Disabled and Homeless Veterans
If a VA counselor determines that you need training to reach your vocational 
goal, you may train in a vocational school, a special rehabilitation facility, 
an apprenticeship program, an on-the-job training position, a college, or a 
university. In addition to covering the costs or tuition of your training pro-
gram, the VA may pay for fees, books, equipment, tools, or other supplies 
you need to succeed in your program.
You may be breathing a sigh of relief that the government picks up the costs 
for much of this training. But wait! I’ve got more good news. During your 
program, you may qualify for a monthly subsistence allowance to help you 
meet your living expenses. The allowance you receive depends on
 
✓ The type of training you receive and where you receive it
 
✓ Your rate of attendance (full-time versus part-time enrollment)
 
✓ The number of dependents you have
See the “Monthly subsistence allowance rates” section in this chapter for 
more details about how much money Uncle Sam will kick in to help you cover 
other expenses. You’ll receive this allowance in addition to any VA compen-
sation or military retired pay you may receive. Additionally, the VA will 
provide medical and dental care while you’re enrolled in a training program. 
I’m afraid that your dependents aren’t covered for medical care or dental 
care under this program, however.
 
You can’t use more than one VA education program at a time. If you’re going 
to college on the GI Bill (see Chapter 10), the VA can’t pay education benefits 
under Chapter 31. Additionally, if you have remaining GI Bill benefits, you 
can’t receive free education under this program. You have to use your GI Bill 
benefits first.
Monthly subsistence allowance rates
In addition to paying for fees, tuition, books, tools, supplies, and other 
equipment while you’re participating in a training program, the VA may 
determine that you qualify for a monthly subsistence allowance. You don’t 
apply separately for this benefit. If you’re approved for VA-funded education, 
the VA determines whether you need the subsistence allowance, based 
on your household income. The rates vary depending on where you train, 
your enrollment status, and the number of dependents you have. You can 
use this money however you need to while you’re training for your new gig.

200
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
The subsistence allowance is paid monthly, via direct deposit to your bank 
account on the first of every month, and it’s not subject to income taxes.
The rates listed in the tables in the following sections are as of October 1, 
2007. For the latest rates, go to www.vba.va.gov/bln/vre/sa.htm.
Institutional training
These subsistence allowance rates are paid if you are enrolled in an institu-
tion of higher learning, such as a college or university. Table 11-1 shows the 
monthly subsistence rates you may receive if you are enrolled in college or 
university courses.

Full time means taking at least 12 credit hours in a term, or 24 clock hours per week. Three-quarters 
time is defined as at least 9 credit hours in a term, or 18 clock hours per week. Half time means 
taking at least 6 credit hours in a term, or 12 clock hours per week.
Work-experience programs
If you enroll in a nonpay or nominal-pay work experience program in a 
federal, state, local, or federally recognized Indian tribe agency, the monthly 
rates are the same as the institutional training rates shown in Table 11-1.
Public Law 102-477 allows federal, state, or local recognized Indian tribes to 
use federal grants to establish work-experience programs for members of 
their tribe. Of course, to participate in one of these work-education programs 
and receive the subsistence rates shown in Table 11-1, you would have to be 
a veteran entitled to Chapter 31 benefits and also be a member of the tribe.
 
When computing entitlement for such work-experience programs, full time 
equates to 40 hours per week, three-quarters time means 30 hours per week, 
and half time is equal to 20 hours of work per week.

201
 Chapter 11: Aid and Vocational Training for Disabled and Homeless Veterans
Nonpay on-the-job training programs
The government pays a monthly subsistence allowance only for full-time 
training in the following training programs:
 
✓ Nonpay or nominal pay on-the-job training in a federal, state, or local 
program or a federally recognized Indian tribe agency.
 
✓ Training in the home: This includes distance learning courses and 
correspondence courses that aren’t part of an accredited college or 
university program.
 
✓ Vocational course in a rehabilitation facility or sheltered workshop: 
As an essential part of their programs, many shelters and rehabilitation 
facilities include vocational courses. Training received in these types of 
facilities may qualify you for the monthly subsistence allowance.
 
✓ Institutional nonfarm cooperative: A cooperative is a business that is 
owned and controlled equally by the people who use its services or who 
work at it. They are often referred to as a co-op.
 
You may be confused about what constitutes a work-experience program (see 
the preceding section) and what an on-the-job training (OJT) program is. A 
work-experience program provides you with job experience that you can then 
put on a resume or job application to make you more employable. OJT, on the 
other hand, is a formal training program that leads to a job in the same agency 
after the OJT period is complete.
The monthly rates for subsistence allowance when you’re in a nonpay on-the-
job training program are shown in Table 11-2.

Farm cooperative, apprenticeship, or other on-the-job training
Monthly subsistence rates for farm cooperative, apprenticeship, or other 
on-the-job training programs are reduced because you receive a salary 
to participate in such programs. Rates, shown in Table 11-3, are paid for 
full-time enrollment only.

Farm cooperatives are just like nonfarm cooperatives (see the preceding 
section), except they exist in the fields of agriculture and livestock. The 
majority of America’s 2 million farmers and ranchers belong to one or more 
farm cooperatives. Because of the tax breaks these cooperatives receive, 
they are required to pay salaries to Chapter 31 Program veterans who are 
training with them.
Apprenticeship and OJT programs lead to full-time employment after the 
apprenticeship or OJT period is completed.
Other types of programs
Subsistence allowance is also paid for nonfarm cooperative institutional 
training and nonfarm cooperative on-the-job training that’s not operated by a 
recognized Indian tribe. If you’re enrolled in a nonfarm cooperative institu-
tional training program, you’ll receive the full-time rates listed in Table 11-1, 
but only full-time rates apply. Those enrolled in a nonfarm cooperative 
on-the-job training program receive the rates listed in Table 11-3.
Buckling down and participating 
in a VA work-study program
Veterans who are participating in the Chapter 31 Program and training at the 
three-quarters or full-time rate may participate in the VA’s work-study pro-
gram. In this type of program, you work during or between periods of enroll-
ment in your vocational training or education program. When you participate 
in the VA’s work-study program, you’re working both sides of the fence, so to 
speak. You’re using the VA’s benefits to master a new skill or knowledge 
(that’s the study part). As far as the work half of the program goes, you may 
provide VA outreach services, prepare and process VA paperwork, work at a 
VA medical facility, or perform other VA-approved activities.

203
 Chapter 11: Aid and Vocational Training for Disabled and Homeless Veterans
Under this program, you earn an hourly wage equal to the federal minimum 
wage or your state’s minimum wage, whichever is greater. As much as 
40 percent of the total of your work-study allowance may be paid in advance.
You can arrange with the VA to work any number of hours you want during 
your enrollment, but the total number of hours you work can’t be more than 
25 times the number of weeks in your enrollment period.
Applying for Chapter 31 Benefits
Unlike many other VA programs, you can’t apply online for Chapter 31 train-
ing benefits. You can, however, download VA Form 28-1900, Disabled 
Veterans Application for Vocational Rehabilitation, from the VA’s Web site 
at www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-28-1900-ARE.pdf.
After you complete the application, sign it and mail it to your nearest VA 
regional office (found in Appendix B). The VA will review your application 
and arrange for you to meet with a vocational rehabilitation counselor.
 
You can apply for the program while you’re still in the military. If you are 
pending medical discharge from the military for a condition that is reasonably 
expected to be 20 percent or more disabling, you can submit your application 
before discharge.
Using Benefits beyond Education 
and Training
As I mention in the “Examining Your Eligibility for Chapter 31” section, the 
VA may determine that you’re entitled to participate in the program but that 
you don’t need education or vocational training to meet your employment 
objectives. In such cases, the program offers several other valuable benefits:
 
✓ Comprehensive rehabilitation evaluation to determine abilities, skills, 
interests, and needs: These include tests and interviews designed to 
help you discover what occupational field you may be best suited for.
 
✓ Vocational counseling and rehabilitation planning: VA counselors can 
help you plan a course of action and a set of goals, leading to your 
dream job.

204
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
 
✓ Employment services such as job-seeking skills, resume development, 
and other work readiness assistance: To find a job, you need to know 
where to look, and VA counselors can help with that. They can also 
assist you with preparing that perfect resume in order to land the job of 
your choice.
 
✓ Assistance finding and keeping a job, including the use of special 
employer incentives: Some employers give special job preference to 
veterans. The federal government is the perfect example (see Chapter 12). 
The VA can help you locate employers who prefer to hire veterans.
 
✓ Supportive rehabilitation services, including case management, 
counseling, and referral: While enrolled in the Chapter 31 Program, 
you receive ongoing support, counseling, and feedback from the VA, 
leading to the day when you cash that first paycheck.
 
✓ Independent living services: If you’re a veteran with a serious disabil-
ity, one severe enough to require assistance to perform your daily 
living activities, the VA has programs that can help you transition to an 
independent living status.
Giving Homeless Veterans 
a Helping Hand
About 250 community-based organizations are dedicated to helping the 
homeless veteran. Most of these organizations work with the VA, other gov-
ernment agencies, veterans organizations, and community groups to help 
provide support, resources, and opportunities to America’s homeless veter-
ans. The services offered by these organizations vary widely, limited only 
by available funds and the imagination of the organizers. Some of them offer 
traditional homeless services, such as overnight shelters and soup kitchens, 
while others provide counseling and referral services, and still others offer 
medical screenings and limited medical care.
 
For a list of these community-based service providers, see the National 
Coalition for Homeless Veterans Web site at www.nchv.org/network.cfm.
The VA has established homeless veteran coordinators in every state. The 
coordinators work with local community-based organizations to provide 
services to homeless veterans, but the coordinators are available to answer 
questions and provide referrals to individual veterans as well.
 
You can find your state’s homeless veteran coordinator by visiting the VA’s 
Web site at www1.va.gov/homeless/page.cfm?pg=21, or by calling the 
VA’s toll-free services line at 800-827-1000.

205
 Chapter 11: Aid and Vocational Training for Disabled and Homeless Veterans
I explain some of the services available to homeless veterans in the following 
sections.
Examining the plight of the homeless veteran
According to the VA, in urban, suburban, and 
rural communities throughout America, one of 
every three adult males sleeping under bridges, 
in alleys, and in abandoned buildings or living in 
shelters or other community-based organiza-
tions has served our nation in the armed 
forces.
If I knew all the answers, I’d be the king of the 
authors. Unfortunately, nobody knows for sure 
why there are so many homeless veterans. 
Many veterans are homeless because of the 
complex set of factors that affect all homeless 
people: extreme shortage of affordable hous-
ing, livable income, limited access to health-
care, and a lack of family and social support 
networks.
A large number of homeless veterans live with 
the lingering effects of post traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse, and 
that’s likely the key. PTSD is an insidious thing; 
it creeps into the mind. It doesn’t always affect 
the veteran right away, nor are veterans neces-
sarily homeless right after discharge. Many 
times, it takes years for depression, anxiety, 
substance abuse, and bad economic situations 
to take their toll, driving veterans to the street.
A person doesn’t always know that he’s suffer-
ing from PTSD. If you know a veteran who is 
suffering from depression, drug or alcohol 
abuse, or mental health issues, please try to 
get them to seek help at a VA medical center. 
See Chapter 4 for information about receiving 
medical care from the VA.
The vast majority of homeless veterans are 
single men, although service providers are 
reporting an increased number of veterans, 
both women and men, with children seeking 
their assistance. Beyond that, the statistics for 
homeless veterans are alarming:
 ✓ 23 percent of America’s homeless are 
veterans
 ✓ 33 percent of all male homeless in America 
are veterans
 ✓ 47 percent served during the Vietnam era
 ✓ 17 percent served after Vietnam
 ✓ 15 percent served before the Vietnam era
 ✓ 67 percent served three or more years
 ✓ 33 percent were stationed in war zones
 ✓ 25 percent have used VA homeless 
services
 ✓ 85 percent have completed high school or 
received their GED compared with 56 per-
cent of nonveteran homeless
 ✓ 89 percent received an honorable 
discharge
 ✓ 79 percent reside in central cities
 ✓ 16 percent reside in suburban areas
 ✓ 5 percent reside in rural areas
 ✓ 76 percent experience alcohol, drug, or 
mental health problems
 ✓ 46 percent are white males compared with 
34 percent of nonveteran homeless
 ✓ 54 percent are people of color
 ✓ 46 percent are age 45 or older compared 
with 20 percent of nonveteran homeless

Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
The grant and per diem program
This program doesn’t provide money to the individual veteran. Instead, 
the VA’s Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program provides funding 
to community-based agencies so they can provide essential services to 
homeless veterans.
In order to be eligible, organizations must provide supportive housing (up to 
24 months) to homeless veterans or must offer support services that
 
✓ Help homeless veterans achieve residential stability
 
✓ Increase their skill levels and/or income
 
✓ Obtain greater self-determination
Such services include, but are not limited to
 
✓ Case management
 
✓ Education
 
✓ Crisis intervention
 
✓ Counseling
Grants
The VA provides grants to organizations to pay for the cost of constructing, 
renovating, or acquiring a facility to use for homeless veterans transitional 
housing, or establishing a homeless veterans service center.
The grant limit is 65 percent of the cost. Organizations must find other 
sources for the remaining 35 percent of the costs.
The number of grants issued each year depends in large part on the amount 
of funding that Congress approves for the program.
Grants can’t be used to pay for operational costs or salaries. That’s the pur-
pose of the per diem portion of the program, as explained in the next section.
Per diem
Per diem may be paid by the VA to community-based agencies that provide 
services for homeless veterans to supplement salaries and operational costs. 
Per diem is simply a fancy VA word for additional funding that’s based on the 
actual number of homeless veterans receiving service from the agency.

207
 Chapter 11: Aid and Vocational Training for Disabled and Homeless Veterans
Organizations that received a grant (see the preceding section) get first 
priority to available per-diem funds.
For organizations that provide housing, the maximum amount of per diem 
paid is $33.01 per day for each veteran housed. These are the rates for 2008. 
The VA may adjust these rates periodically, based on the funding it receives 
each year from Congress. Organizations that provide support services only 
may receive one-eighth of the daily cost of care, not to exceed the current VA 
State Home rate for rehabilitation and treatment care, and not to exceed 
eight hours in any one day.
Applying for the program
Organizations interested in applying for the VA’s Homeless Providers Grant 
and Per Diem Program should call 877-332-0334 or write to VA Homeless 
Providers Grant and Per Diem Program, Office of Mental Health Services 
(116E), VAHQ, 810 Vermont Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20420.
Stand Downs for homeless veterans
Stand Downs are usually organized by local veterans groups, with support 
from the VA. It’s a case of veterans helping veterans. Since 1988, when the 
first Stand Down was organized in San Diego by a group of Vietnam veterans, 
the program has helped more than 200,000 homeless veterans and their 
families.
The name Stand Down comes from a program used during the Vietnam 
War to provide a safe retreat for troops returning from combat operations. 
Combat units would be relocated to a secure base camp area, where they 
could take care of personal hygiene, get clean uniforms, enjoy warm meals, 
receive medical and dental care, mail and receive letters, and enjoy the cama-
raderie of friends in a safe environment. Stand Downs gave weary soldiers the 
chance to renew their spirit, health, and overall sense of well-being.
This is also the purpose of the Stand Down programs for homeless veterans. 
Today’s Stand Downs are organized by grass-roots, community-based 
organizations and are designed to give the homeless veteran a respite from 
“combat” life on the streets. Stand Downs can be a one-, two-, or three-day 
event. Although some are conducted indoors, the majority are held on 
football fields, in parks, or in other wide-open spaces. During Stand Downs, 
homeless veterans can simply show up and receive a broad range of services, 
including food and clothing; medical, legal, and mental health assistance; job 
counseling and referrals; and companionship and camaraderie.

208
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
The VA supports Homeless Veteran Stand Downs in major cities throughout 
the United States. If you’re a homeless veteran, you don’t have to register, 
sign up, apply, or fill out any forms to attend a Stand Down. Simply show up. 
If you know a homeless veteran, why don’t you do him a big favor and take 
him to the next Stand Down hosted in your community?
 
To see a list of scheduled Stand Downs in your area, visit www1.va.gov/
homeless/page.cfm?pg=6 or call 202-461-7401.
If you are part of a community-based organization and would like to conduct a 
Stand Down in your area, the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans would 
love to help you get started. You can contact them at National Coalition for 
Homeless Veterans, 3331/2 Pennsylvania Ave., SE, Washington, DC 20003-1148; 
phone 202-546-1969; e-mail nchv2@nchv.org; Web site www.nchv.org.
Veterans industry: Group homes
The VA operates a Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) program at 162 loca-
tions throughout the nation. This program allows at-risk, disadvantaged, and 
homeless veterans to live in supervised group homes while working for pay.
Professional CWT staff provides state-of-the-art vocational rehabilitation 
services; job matching and employment support; and case management 
for the transitioning veteran. The VA contracts with private companies 
and government agencies to provide jobs for these veterans. Participants 
learn new job skills and successful work habits, and they regain a sense of 
self-worth and self-esteem.
The average length of stay in the program is 174 days, and veterans work 
about 33 hours per week, earning approximately $732 per month. Out of that, 
the veteran pays an average of $186 per month for rent at the group home.
 
A list of program locations is available on the VA’s Web site at www1.va.gov/
vetind/page.cfm?pg=4. Veterans can apply for the program through their 
VA regional office (see Appendix B).
Drop-in centers
Drop-in centers aren’t homeless shelters in the traditional sense. They 
don’t provide overnight accommodations. They are community-organized 
programs, supported by the VA, that provide a daytime sanctuary where 

209
 Chapter 11: Aid and Vocational Training for Disabled and Homeless Veterans
homeless veterans can clean up, wash their clothes, and participate in 
a variety of therapeutic and rehabilitative activities. Some facilities offer 
additional services, such as meals or an address where homeless veterans 
can have their mail sent. The centers can also provide referral services to 
longer-term assistance.
 
To find the location of your nearest drop-in center, check with your state’s 
homeless veteran coordinator by visiting the VA’s Web site at www1.va.gov/
homeless/page.cfm?pg=21 or by calling the VA’s toll-free services line at 
800-827-1000.
Donations of excess government property
The VA collects excess government personal property, such as hats, 
coats, parkas, socks, footwear, gloves, sleeping bags, and other items, and 
distributes them to homeless veteran programs throughout the United 
States. The program’s name is a mouthful: the VA Excess Property for 
Homeless Veterans Initiative.
An interesting aspect of this program is that the main distribution center at 
the Medical Center in Lyons, New Jersey, is staffed entirely by formerly home-
less veterans working there under a Compensated Work Therapy Program 
(see the “Veterans industry: Group homes” section for more details).
Foreclosure help and prevention
Housing foreclosures made big news in 2008. Perhaps you know a friend, 
relative, or neighbor who has lost her home through foreclosure. It’s a fact of 
life with a volatile job and housing market. Fortunately, for veterans, help is 
available.
VA financial counselors at 11 regional loan centers throughout the United 
States can assist veterans in avoiding foreclosure through counseling and 
special financing arrangements. The centers are located at
 
✓ Atlanta, Georgia: 888-768-2132
 
✓ Cleveland, Ohio: 800-729-5772
 
✓ Denver, Colorado: 888-349-7541
 
✓ Honolulu, Hawaii: 808-433-0481
 
✓ Houston, Texas: 888-232-2571

✓ St. Petersburg, Florida: 888-611-5916
 
✓ Winston/Salem, North Carolina: 888-244-6711
The counseling isn’t limited to veterans who have VA home loans (see 
Chapter 13); veterans with other types of home loans can also receive 
assistance. VA counselors have helped about 74,000 veterans, active-duty 
members, and survivors keep their homes since 2000.
 
To obtain help from a VA financial counselor, call the number listed for the 
center near you, or you can call the VA toll-free at 877-827-3702.
The Residential Rehabilitation 
and Treatment Program
The VA’s Residential Rehabilitation and Treatment Program provides a full 
range of treatment and rehabilitation services to many homeless veterans. 
This program is designed for homeless veterans with health problems, 
including mental health conditions.
The average length of stay in the program is four months. In addition to 
health treatment, the facilities conduct outreach and referral; vocational 
counseling and rehabilitation; and post-discharge community support.
VA has established 34 rehab and treatment facilities, providing 1,873 beds. 
More than 71,000 homeless veterans have received medical treatment 
through this program since 1987.
 
To locate a facility, contact your state’s homeless veterans coordinator by 
visiting the VA’s Web site at www1.va.gov/homeless/page.cfm?pg=21 or 
by calling the VA’s toll-free services line at 800-827-1000.
 
Homeless veterans, like other veterans, may also be eligible for the VA health-
care program, as explained in Chapter 4, and disability and pension programs, 
as detailed in Chapter 6.

T
here is a working life after the military. Every single person I know who 
got out of uniform, even if he retired after 20 or more years of service, 
got a civilian job sooner or later. Unless you’re lucky enough to win the 
lottery while you’re in the military, you’re not going to make enough money 
from your military service to set you up for life. (Don’t laugh about the 
lottery thing, though; I know three people who won the lottery while in the 
service.)
Fortunately for veterans who don’t have a rich, dying relative, two veterans 
benefits can help you get on with your life — your working life, that is.
The first is the veterans’ preference system, which gives certain veterans a 
head start when applying for many federal government jobs. The program 
gives veterans bonus points in the job-hiring process, just for being a 
veteran. Unfortunately, it doesn’t apply to all federal jobs, and there are 
a few catches (when isn’t there a catch or two?). More on that later in this 
chapter.
Second is the Patriot Express Small Business Loan Initiative, which was 
established in June 2007. It provides loan guarantees of up to $500,000 
for veterans and certain family members who want to start a small business. 
It also provides small business loans to those who already own a small 
business. Read on for more information!

Veterans’ Preference: A Leg 
Up for Federal Jobs
Did you know that veterans hold a far higher percentage of jobs in the gov-
ernment than they do in private industry? It’s true. This is due in large part 
to a conglomerate of federal laws that together form the veterans’ preference 
system.
Unlike most veterans benefit programs, this benefit isn’t managed by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It’s run by the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM), which is the government organization in charge of 
hiring and firing for most federal jobs.
Veterans’ preference doesn’t mean a veteran is placed in every vacant 
federal job. The program doesn’t guarantee a job for veterans. It simply gives 
veterans a slight advantage over nonveterans who apply for the same job.
Why veterans get preference
Military veterans have been given some degree of preference in appoint-
ments to federal jobs ever since the Civil War. Recognizing their sacrifice, 
Congress enacted laws to prevent veterans seeking federal employment from 
being penalized for their time in military service. Veterans’ preference
 
✓ Recognizes the economic loss suffered by citizens who have served 
their country in uniform
 
✓ Restores veterans to a favorable competitive position for government 
employment
 
✓ Acknowledges the larger obligation owed to disabled veterans
Veterans’ preference is not so much a reward for being in uniform as it is a 
way to help make up for the economic loss suffered by those who answered 
the nation’s call to arms. Historically, preference has been reserved by 
Congress for those who have been disabled or who served in combat areas.
Qualifying: The veterans’ 
preference point system
Not all military veterans qualify for preference. To qualify, you must meet the 
criteria established by law. Assuming you’re eligible for veterans’ preference 
and you meet the minimum qualification requirements of the position, 5 or 10 
points are added to your score on the civil service examination.

213
 Chapter 12: Veterans’ Job Preference & Small Business Loans
 
Entitlement to veterans’ preference doesn’t guarantee a job. An agency 
has many ways to fill a vacancy other than by appointment from a list of 
candidates.
 
Military retirees at or above the rank of major or equivalent aren’t entitled to 
preference unless they qualify for 10-point preference as disabled veterans.
5-point preference
If you’re an honorably discharged veteran and you served on active duty 
during certain periods of time or during certain campaigns, you may qualify 
for 5-point veterans’ preference. In this case, an honorable discharge means 
you must have received an honorable or general discharge (see Chapter 2 for 
a description of military discharge characterizations). Additionally, active 
duty for training (such as weekend Guard or Reserve duty) doesn’t count. To 
qualify, you must have served during any one of the following periods:
 
✓ During any war (this means a war declared by Congress, the last of 
which was World War II).
 
✓ Between April 28, 1952, and July 1, 1955 (the Korean War).
 
✓ For more than 180 consecutive days, any part of which occurred after 
January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976 (the Vietnam War).
 
✓ During the Gulf War period beginning August 2, 1990, and ending 
January 2, 1992.
 
✓ For more than 180 consecutive days, any part of which occurred during 
the period beginning September 11, 2001, and ending on the date 
prescribed by presidential proclamation or by law as the last day of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom.
 
✓ In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been 
authorized, such as El Salvador, Lebanon, Granada, Panama, Southwest 
Asia, Somalia, and Haiti. (See the nearby sidebar for a complete listing.)
If you are a medal holder or Gulf War veteran who originally enlisted after 
September 7, 1980, or entered active duty on or after October 14, 1982, you 
must have completed at least 24 months of continuous active duty to qualify 
for 5-point preference.
10-point preference
To qualify for 10-point preference, you must have an honorable or general 
discharge and be one of the following:
 
✓ A disabled veteran with a present service-connected disability
 
✓ A Purple Heart medal recipient
 
✓ The spouse of a veteran who is unable to work because of a service-
connected disability

214
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
 
✓ The unmarried widow of a veteran who died in service or from a 
service-connected disability
 
✓ The mother of a veteran who died in service or is permanently and 
totally disabled
U.S. military campaigns and expeditions
The United States military has participated 
in many combat campaigns and expeditions 
over the years. The campaigns and expeditions 
listed here qualify for 5-point veterans’ 
preference:
 ✓ Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (AFEM): 
A veteran’s DD Form 214 showing the award 
of any Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal 
is acceptable proof. The DD Form 214 
doesn’t have to show the name of the the-
ater or country of service for which the 
medal was awarded.

How candidates are chosen
When the government wants to hire a new employee, several factors are 
considered. For scientific and professional positions in grade GS-9 or higher 
(see the “How the VRA works” section for more on job grades), names of all 
candidates are listed in order of their total ratings (civil service examination, 
qualifications, work experience, and so on). For all other positions, the names 
of 10-point preference candidates who have a service-connected disability 
of 10 percent or more are placed ahead of the names of all other applicants. 
Other candidates are then listed in order of their total earned ratings. A 
preference-eligible candidate is listed ahead of a nonpreference-eligible 
candidate with the same score.

Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
The federal agency doing the hiring must select from the top three candi-
dates. This is known as the Rule of 3 (creative, eh?). The agency may not 
pass over a preference eligible in favor of a lower-ranking nonpreference 
eligible without sound reasons that relate directly to the veteran’s fitness for 
employment. The agency may, however, select a lower-ranking preference 
eligible over a disabled veteran within the Rule of 3.
 
If you’re preference eligible and are passed over for a federal position, you can 
request a copy of the agency’s reasons for the pass-over and the examining 
office’s response.
If the preference-eligible veteran is 30 percent or more disabled, the agency 
must notify the veteran and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) of 
the proposed pass-over. The veteran has 15 days from the date of notification 
to respond to the OPM. The OPM then decides whether to approve the pass-
over based on all the facts available and notifies the agency and the veteran.
Finding and filling federal jobs
One way to find a federal job is to directly contact the agency where you 
want to work and inquire about opportunities. For example, if your dream is 
to work in rain, snow, sleet, or gloom of night, you should contact the United 
States Postal Agency’s personnel office. If you qualify for one of the special 
appointing authorities (such as the VRA; see the section “Veterans Recruit-
ment Appointment” later in this chapter), be sure to let the agency personnel 
office know.
 
Federal law also requires OPM to list all competitive vacancies with state 
employment offices. So if you’re looking for federal employment in your 
particular state, this would be the place to start.
The federal government’s Employment Information System is a wonderful 
employment resource. Available at www.usajobs.gov, this online site gives 
you access to federal job vacancies, employment information fact sheets, 
and job applications and forms. It also has online resume development and 
electronic transmission capabilities, so you can apply for many federal 
jobs online.
Two categories of federal jobs
Virtually all federal jobs can be divided into one of two categories: competi-
tive civil service and excepted service. Veterans can be given preference for 
both types of jobs:

217
 Chapter 12: Veterans’ Job Preference & Small Business Loans
 
✓ Competitive civil service: This type of job is exactly what it sounds like. 
Individuals compete with other individuals for a specific job vacancy, 
and the one with the best overall qualifications is supposed to get the 
job. Points are granted for various factors, including experience, qualifi-
cations, and score achieved on the civil service examination.
 
 When considering whom to hire, government agencies are bound by 
complicated federal laws. Some jobs must be filled by candidates who 
are already in the civil service (merit promotion); some jobs can be 
filled by applicants outside the civil service (competitive); and some 
jobs must be filled under one of the special appointing authorities 
(special appointments; see the “Veterans Recruitment Appointment” 
section for more on special appointments that apply to veterans).
 
• Merit promotion appointment: This type of appointment happens 
when a particular government agency plans to fill a vacancy by 
promoting from within. Sometimes the agency promotes from 
within the agency, and at other times it opens the appointment to 
employees of other federal agencies. When an agency decides on 
the latter, veterans can apply for the vacancy, even if they aren’t 
currently civil service employees. However, when competing 
for merit promotion vacancies, veterans don’t receive veterans’ 
preference points. They compete on a merit-to-merit basis with 
the other candidates. The advantage to veterans, under this 
type of appointment, is that veterans who aren’t current civil 
service employees can apply, while nonveterans/noncivil service 
employees are ineligible.
 
• Competitive appointment: A competitive appointment is one in 
which the veteran competes with others from a list of eligible 
candidates. This is the normal entry route into the civil service for 
most employees. Before a job is filled by competitive appointment, 
OPM must announce the job opening to the public. Veterans’ 
preference applies in this situation, and those veterans who qualify 
for veterans’ preference have 5 or 10 extra points added to 
their passing score on a civil service examination. Therefore, the 
veteran has a slight advantage over nonveteran applicants.
 
✓ Excepted service: Excepted service jobs, as the name suggests, are 
excepted from most or all of the civil service laws for various reasons. 
Positions are excepted by law, by presidential executive order, or by 
federal regulations. For example, certain entire agencies, such as the 
Postal Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Central 
Intelligence Agency, are excepted by law. In other cases, certain jobs or 
classes of jobs in an agency are excepted by federal regulations. These 
include attorneys, chaplains, student trainees, and others. Veterans may 
or may not receive veterans’ preference, depending on the specific 
hiring practices of the agency or program.

Applying for the job
You can apply for most jobs with a resume or the Optional Application for 
Federal Employment (OF-612), which can be downloaded at www.opm.gov/
FORMS/pdf_fill/of612.pdf.
If you decide to apply using a resume, make sure you include the following 
information, as a minimum:
 
✓ Job information: Announcement number, title, and grade.
 
✓ Personal information: Full name, mailing address (with zip code), day 
and evening phone numbers (with area code), Social Security number, 
country of citizenship, veterans’ preference, reinstatement eligibility, 
highest federal civilian grade held.
 
✓ Education: High school name, city, and state; college or university name, 
city, and state; majors and type and year of any degrees received (if you 
didn’t earn a degree, show the total credits earned and indicate whether 
they were semester or quarter hours).
 
✓ Work experience: Job title, duties and accomplishments, employer’s 
name and address, supervisor’s name and phone number, starting and 
ending dates (month and year), hours per week, salary, and whether 
your current supervisor may be contacted. Prepare a separate entry for 
each job.
 
✓ Other qualifications: Job-related training courses (title and year), skills, 
certificates and licenses, honors, awards, and special accomplishments.
Veterans Recruitment Appointment
Congress has written a slew of laws that, in some cases, allow a government 
agency to noncompetitively hire under a special appointment authority. In 
other words, the agency directors can pretty much hire anyone they want to, 
as long as the candidate falls within the scope of that particular special 
appointment authority.
One such authority is known as the Veterans Recruitment Appointment 
(VRA) authority. Veterans who are disabled or who served in certain cam-
paigns may be hired if an agency elects to select a candidate under this 
authority. Veterans who are eligible under this special authority have a 
significant advantage over others who want to work for the government — 
the veterans don’t have to compete against anyone for the job (this is called 
a noncompetitive appointment).

219
 Chapter 12: Veterans’ Job Preference & Small Business Loans
An agency that wants to hire through the VRA can simply appoint the eligible 
veteran to any position for which the veteran is qualified. There is no red 
tape or special appointment procedure.
How the VRA works
The Veterans Recruitment Appointment allows a federal agency to appoint 
an eligible veteran without competition. This appointment can only be 
made to a position that would otherwise be a competitive appointment (see 
the “Two categories of federal jobs” section for more on this type of appoint-
ment). If you’re hired for a federal job under this authority, you convert to a 
career appointment in the competitive service after two years of satisfactory 
performance as a government employee.
When two or more VRA applicants are preference eligible, the agency must 
apply veterans’ preference points before deciding whom to hire. (Just 
because you may qualify for VRA, doesn’t necessarily mean you qualify for 
veterans’ preference points; see the next section for details on qualifying 
for VRA.)
VRA candidates may be appointed to any position up to GS-11 or equivalent. 
Of course, you must be able to meet the qualification requirements for the 
position. The good news is that for GS-3 positions or equivalent, any military 
service experience is considered qualifying.
Once onboard, VRA appointees are treated like any other competitive service 
employee and may be promoted, reassigned, or transferred. VRA appointees 
with less than 15 years of education must complete a training program 
established by the agency.
 
Just as the military has ranks, civil service also has a rank system (sort of). 
Blue-collar workers fall under a pay scale called wage grade, or WG. Federal 
employees considered to be white-collar workers — such as professional, 
technical, administrative, and clerical positions — are under the general 
schedule (GS). There are 15 grades of GS, ranging from GS-1 to GS-15. Higher 
numbers mean higher rank (and more pay).
VRA eligibility criteria
Up until recently, only veterans who had a 30 percent or greater service-
connected disability could qualify for a VRA appointment. This changed in 
2007 when Congress passed the Jobs for Veterans Act. Under this law, you 
now qualify if you
 
✓ Are a disabled veteran
 
✓ Served on active duty in the armed forces during a war, or in a campaign 
or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized

220
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
 
✓ Participated on active duty in a U.S. military operation for which an 
Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded
 
✓ Have been separated from active duty for less than 180 days
If you claim eligibility on the basis of service in a campaign or expedition for 
which a medal was awarded, you must be able to prove that you earned the 
campaign badge or medal.
 
Your DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, lists 
your earned medals in Block 13. See Chapter 2 for more information.
In addition to meeting the listed criteria, you must have been separated 
under honorable conditions (that is, received either an honorable or general 
discharge).
 
To maximize your opportunities, if you’re eligible for both preference and 
noncompetitive appointments you should, where possible, make sure you are 
being considered both competitively through a civil service examination and 
noncompetitively under special authority such as the VRA.
Patriot Express Veterans 
Small Business Loans
Maybe you don’t want a cushy government job. Perhaps, after years of listen-
ing to superiors giving you orders, you don’t want any job in which you’re 
not the boss. Maybe your post-military dream is to own your own business. 
In most cases, however, starting a small business requires money, sometimes 
lots of money. Where can you get the bucks to start your dream business?
The answer may be the Patriot Express Veterans Small Business Loan pro-
gram. This program provides loans for veterans who want to start a small 
business or expand a small business they already own. Patriot Express isn’t 
managed by the VA; it’s administered by the U.S. Small Business 
Administration (SBA).
Patriot Express is a pilot program that officially started in June 2007, but it 
didn’t really get off the ground and start making loans until February 2008. 
Because it’s a pilot program, nobody knows how long it will last, but it will 
continue at least until December 31, 2010. At that time, the SBA will evaluate 
the program and determine whether it should be retained, modified, or 
eliminated. If you’re thinking of starting your own small business, you may 
want to get in while the getting is good.

221
 Chapter 12: Veterans’ Job Preference & Small Business Loans
The SBA definition of a small business
When the U.S. Congress first established SBA, the fundamental question was 
just what numerical definition SBA should use to define small businesses, 
industry by industry, to determine what businesses were eligible for SBA’s 
programs. Over the years SBA has established and revised numerical 
definitions for all for-profit industries, and this numerical definition is called 
a size standard.
The most common size standards are as follows:
 
✓ 500 employees or fewer for most manufacturing and mining industries
 
✓ 100 employees or fewer for all wholesale trade industries
 
✓ $6.5 million or less for most retail and service industries
 
✓ $31 million or less for most general and heavy construction industries
 
✓ $13 million or less for all special trade contractors
 
✓ $750,000 or less for most agricultural industries
If you plan to apply for a loan through the Patriot Express program, your 
business must meet one of these standards.
Borrowing up to a half a million bucks!
You can borrow up to $500,000 under the Patriot Express program. The SBA 
will guarantee up to 85 percent of the borrowed amount for loans of $150,000 
or less and up to 75 percent for loans over $150,000 up to $500,000.
The U.S. government doesn’t actually lend you the money. Instead, it guaran-
tees a large percentage of your loan to the lender. In other words, if you 
default, the government repays the lender the lion’s share of the loan. Think 
of it as having your favorite Uncle Sam as your co-signer. (This is also how 
the VA Home Loan program is set up. You can read more about that in 
Chapter 13.)
You don’t need to provide collateral for many loans, but for loans above 
$350,000, lenders are required to take all available collateral.
Interest rates can vary, depending on certain factors, but the SBA guarantees 
it will use its lowest small business loan rates under the Patriot Express 
program. These rates are generally 2.25 to 4.75 percent over prime, depend-
ing on the loan’s size and time to maturity. Interest rates are usually on the 
high end for larger loans and loans with a longer repayment period.

222
Part III: Understanding Education and Employment Programs 
Checking your eligibility
Most veterans, and even some spouses of veterans, are eligible for the Patriot 
Express program. Eligibility includes
 
✓ Veterans (except those with a dishonorable discharge). See Chapter 2 
for information about discharge characterizations.
 
✓ Service-disabled veterans. You can find out more about service-
connected disabilities in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Active-duty members eligible for the military’s Transition Assistance 
Program. This includes military retirees within 24 months of separation 
and other active-duty members within 12 months of separation.
 
✓ Reservists and National Guard members.
 
✓ Current spouses of any of these folks.
 
✓ The widowed spouse of a service member or veteran who died during 
service or of a service-connected disability.
Making your business plan
You can’t just walk into a lender and get a small business loan, even under 
the guarantees of programs such as Patriot Express. The lender wants to 
know that your business is likely to succeed and that you’ll be able to repay 
the loan. In other words, they want to see a solid business plan.
A business plan precisely defines your business, identifies your goals, and 
serves as your firm’s resume. Its basic components include a current and 
pro forma balance sheet, an income statement, and a cash flow analysis. 
A business plan helps you allocate resources properly, handle unforeseen 
complications, and make the right decisions. Because it provides specific 
and organized information about your company and how you will repay 
borrowed money, a good business plan is a crucial part of any loan package. 
Additionally, it tells your sales personnel, suppliers, and others about your 
operations and goals.
Writing a solid business plan isn’t an easy task and is beyond the scope of 
this book. The SBA has an excellent tutorial on writing the perfect business 
plan for your small business. You can access the tutorial online at www.sba.
gov/smallbusinessplanner/plan/index.html. (You can also check 
out Business Plans For Dummies or Business Plan Kits For Dummies, both 
published by Wiley.)

In this part . . .
A
re high prices, expensive airline flights, and outra-
geous hotel rates holding you back from your dream 
of owning a home, traveling, or just owning nice things? If 
you fall into that special category of military veteran or 
family member, privileged to possess the enchanted mili-
tary identification card, you’ve got a distinct advantage 
over many other people.
In this part, I take you on a trip through the home loan 
program, military shopping, and the wonderful world of 
military veterans travel benefits. Here you can discover 
how to travel for free on military aircraft to almost any 
country in the world. You also find out how to stay cheap 
at military motels, rest and relax at luxurious military 
vacation resorts, or even rent a condominium at more 
than 3,500 locations for the unbelievably low price of $329 
per week. So what are you waiting for? Take a ride with 
me on the veterans travel train!

Chapter 13
Financing Your Dream House: 
VA Home Loan Guarantees
In This Chapter
▶ Guaranteeing a place to live with the home loan guarantee
▶ Discovering how much you can borrow
▶ Claiming your spot on the eligibility list
▶ Steps for successful home buying
▶ Knowing the program’s limits
P
art of the American Dream includes buying your own home. Owning 
your own home can give you a sense of security and stability, and it 
makes a whole lot more sense than putting money into a landlord’s pocket 
each month.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has made this dream come true for 
countless veterans over the years. Since 1944, when the program was first 
established by law, the VA Home Loan Program has guaranteed more than 18 
million loans to veterans to purchase or construct a home or to refinance 
another home loan on more favorable terms.
Under the foundation law — Public Law 78-346 — the maximum amount of 
guaranty was limited to 50 percent of the loan, not to exceed $2,000. That 
wouldn’t pay for a bathroom in a mobile home today!
Fortunately, the program has kept up with the times. Today, eligible veterans 
can finance as much as $417,000 ($729,000 in some high-cost areas) without a 
down payment.
Despite the benefits of the VA Home Loan Program, many people who qualify 
don’t use it. If you plan to purchase a home in the future, you can’t afford not 
to educate yourself about this valuable veteran benefit. This chapter contains 
the basics of what you need to know.

228
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
It’s Not a Loan, but Guaranteed 
Financing
Despite its name, VA Home Loan Program, the VA doesn’t actually lend you 
the money to buy a house. You don’t get a dime from Uncle Sam. Instead, 
the VA guarantees a portion of the loan amount to the lender, making you a 
much more favorable candidate for a loan in the lender’s eyes.
Because the lender is protected against financial loss in the event that you 
stop making mortgage payments and the lender is forced to foreclose on 
your house, credit and income standards are generally not as strict as they 
can be with other home loan programs. Additionally, having a portion of 
the loan guaranteed gives you much more flexibility in negotiating the best 
possible interest rate. (See the “Knowing How Much Uncle Sam Will 
Guarantee” section for details about amounts.)
You may use VA-guaranteed financing
 
✓ To buy a home
 
✓ To buy a townhouse or condominium unit in a project that has been 
approved by the VA
 
✓ To build a home
 
✓ To repair, alter, or improve a home
 
✓ To simultaneously purchase and improve a home
 
✓ To refinance an existing mortgage under more favorable terms
 
✓ To improve a home through installment of a solar heating and/or 
cooling system or other energy-efficient improvements
 
✓ To buy a manufactured (mobile) home and/or lot
 
✓ To buy and improve a lot on which to place a manufactured home that 
you already own and occupy
 
✓ To refinance a manufactured home loan in order to acquire a lot
You can also use the VA Home Loan Program to buy or construct a residen-
tial property containing more than one family unit. But there are restrictions. 
The total number of separate units can’t be more than four if one veteran is 
buying. If more than one veteran is buying, then one additional family unit 
may be added to the basic four for each veteran participating; thus, one 
veteran could buy four units; two veterans, six units; three veterans, seven 
units; and so on.
In addition, if the veteran must depend on rental income from the property to 
qualify for the loan, the veteran must

229
 Chapter 13: Financing Your Dream House: VA Home Loan Guarantees
 
✓ Show that she has the background or qualifications to be successful as a 
landlord. For example, the VA would want to know if the veteran has 
been a successful landlord in the past or has experience working with a 
rental agency.
 
✓ Have enough cash reserves to make the loan payments for at least six 
months without help from the rental income.
Knowing How Much Uncle 
Sam Will Guarantee
If you meet the eligibility requirements for a VA Home Loan (see the “Military 
Service Requirements for a VA Home Loan” section), your basic entitlement 
is $36,000. That means the VA will guarantee up to $36,000 of your home 
loan for loans of $417,000 or less. That’s the same as making a $36,000 down 
payment from the lender’s point of view. If you need less than $36,000, then 
the VA will only guarantee the amount you borrow.
If you need to borrow more than $417,000, the VA guarantees 25 percent of 
what a company called Freddie Mac (which, as of September 2008, had been 
taken over by the federal government) says is the conforming loan limit for 
the county in which your new home is located.
The conforming loan limit is the amount that Freddie Mac (now the federal 
government) advises banks to limit mortgage loans to for homes located in 
specific parts of the country. In 2008, the limit was $417,000 in the continental 
United States and $625,000 in Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands. Now that the Feds are running things, the Federal Housing Admini-
stration (FHA) is picking up the ball and will publish new rates on January 1 
of each year. Beginning January 1, 2010, rates should be available on the 
FHA’s Web site at portal.hud.gov.
So if the FHA says the maximum conforming loan limit for the area where 
your new dream house is located is $550,000, the VA would guarantee 
25 percent, or $137,500, of that amount.
 
Under current law, the maximum amount that the VA can guarantee is 25 
percent of $729,000, no matter what.
Of course, other types of mortgages are available. To find out more about 
them and for help determining which one is right for your situation, pick 
up a copy of Mortgages For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Eric Tyson and Ray 
Brown (Wiley).

Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
Military Service Requirements 
for a VA Home Loan
The U.S. government believes it’s so important for its current and former 
service members (and their spouses in certain situations) to own their own 
homes that it’s almost impossible to be ineligible for the home loan program. 
To confirm your eligibility, check out the following categories of service.
 
Regardless of category (unless you’re still in the military), you must have a 
discharge that the VA does not consider “dishonorable.” Chapter 2 explains 
how the VA makes such determinations.
The categories for eligibility include:
 
✓ Wartime service: Veterans who served at least 90 days on active 
duty during the periods listed here are eligible. For these periods, the 
active-duty time is not required to be continuous.
• World War II: September 16, 1940, to July 25, 1947
 
• Korean War: June 27, 1950, to January 31, 1955
• Vietnam War: August 5, 1964, to May 7, 1975
 
✓ Peacetime service: To qualify for the VA Home Loan Program for peace-
time service, you must have served at least 181 days of continuous active 
duty during the following periods. Active duty for training doesn’t count.
 
• July 26, 1947, to June 26, 1950
 
• February 1, 1955, to August 4, 1964
 
• May 8, 1975, to September 7, 1980 (enlisted)
 
• May 8, 1975, to October 16, 1981 (officer)
 
✓ September 7, 1980 (enlisted) or October 16, 1981 (officer): If you are 
a veteran who joined the military for the first time after these dates, 
you must meet certain minimum active-duty requirements to qualify. 
You qualify if at least one of the following points applies to your time 
of service:
 
• Completed 24 months of continuous active duty
 
• Served the full period (at least 181 days) for which you were 
ordered or called to active duty from the reserves or National 
Guard
 
• Completed at least 181 days of active duty and were discharged 
for a hardship or a voluntary early-separation program
 
• Were discharged with less than 181 days of service due to an 
involuntary reduction in force, certain medical conditions, or in 
some instances, for the convenience of the government

231
 Chapter 13: Financing Your Dream House: VA Home Loan Guarantees
 
✓ Gulf War service: If you served on active duty during the Gulf War 
(October 2, 1990, to a date yet to be determined), you’re eligible if you 
meet any of the following conditions:
 
• Completed 24 months of continuous active duty
 
• Served the full period (at least 90 days) for which you were 
ordered or called to active duty from the Reserves or National 
Guard
 
• Completed at least 90 days of active duty and were discharged for 
a hardship or a voluntary early-separation program
 
• Were discharged with less than 90 days of service due to an 
involuntary reduction in force, certain medical conditions, or in 
some instances, for the convenience of the government
 
✓ Reserves and National Guard: If you have completed a total of six years 
in the Selected Reserves or National Guard (that means you were a 
member of an active unit and attended required weekend drills and the 
annual two-week training), you’re eligible if you
 
• Received an honorable discharge
 
• Were placed on the retired list
 
• Were transferred to the Standby Reserve or an element of the 
Ready Reserve other than the Selected Reserve after service 
characterized as honorable service
 
• Continue to serve in the Selected Reserves
 
 If you qualify based solely on your Reserve or National Guard service as 
shown here and you’re no longer in the Guard/Reserves, you must have 
an honorable discharge. See Chapter 2 for information about discharge 
characterizations.
 
 If you were discharged in any of these first five categories due to a 
service-connected disability before you completed the required time, 
you’re still eligible for the VA Home Loan Program. Chapter 6 provides 
more information about service-connected disabilities.
 
✓ Active-duty members: If you’re still in the military, you can benefit 
from the VA Home Loan Program before discharge. To qualify, you must 
have served at least 90 days. This will change to at least 181 days after 
the president establishes an end period for Gulf War service.
 
✓ Spouses: Spouses of certain veterans, including veterans of the 
Reserves and National Guard, are also eligible to receive a VA Home 
Loan guarantee. You’re eligible if you are
 
• An unmarried spouse of a veteran who died while in service or 
from a service-connected disability
 
• A spouse of a serviceperson missing in action or a prisoner of war

232
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
 
 The law concerning surviving widows changed in 2003. A surviving 
spouse who remarries upon or after turning 57 and on or after December 
16, 2003, retains her eligibility for the VA Home Loan Program. However, 
a surviving spouse who remarried before December 16, 2003, and upon 
or after reaching age 57, is not eligible.
Using the VA Home Loan 
Program, Step by Step
It’s actually easier to finance a home under the VA Home Loan Program 
than it is under many commercial loan programs. Imagine that! A government-
managed program that’s relatively easy! What will they think of next? 
(If you want more details about the home-buying process in general, check 
out Home Buying For Dummies by Eric Tyson and Ray Brown [Wiley].)
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Obtain counseling.
 
 This isn’t required under the VA Home Loan Program, but it’s certainly 
a good idea — especially for the first-time home buyer. Prepurchase 
counseling gives you information on
 
• The process of buying a home
 
• The key players in the home-buying process
 
• Debt management
 
 Housing counseling is usually free. The Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD) maintains a toll-free number and Web site 
for this purpose. To locate a nearby housing counseling office, call 
800-569-4287, or visit HUD’s Web site at www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/
sfh/hcc/hccprof14.cfm.
 
2. Find a home.
 
 Some people love the hunt for a new home; others hate it. But regard-
less of which camp you fall into, you can’t proceed until you find that 
potential home, sweet home. After you’ve found the place, discuss the 
purchase with the seller or selling agent. It’s perfectly okay to sign a 
purchase contract at this point, as long as it’s conditioned on approval 
of your VA home loan.
3. Select a lender.
 
 Finding a lender who participates in the VA Home Loan Program isn’t 
difficult because virtually all of them do. It’s a good idea to shop 
around to find the best possible terms. Remember, all lenders are not 
created equal.

233
 Chapter 13: Financing Your Dream House: VA Home Loan Guarantees
 
4. Obtain a Certificate of Eligibility.
 
 To obtain a VA home loan, the VA must first certify that you’re eligible 
for the program. This is done by issuing a Certificate of Eligibility.
 
 Maybe you think I should have listed this step first, but there’s a method 
to my madness. Many lenders can obtain this certificate for you, easily 
and almost instantly, through the Automated Certificate of Eligibility 
(ACE) system. This Internet-based application can establish eligibility 
and issue an online Certificate of Eligibility in a matter of seconds. Not 
all cases can be processed through ACE — only those for which the VA 
has sufficient data about the applicant in its records. However, I strongly 
encourage you to ask your lender about this method because it can save 
weeks of time.
 
 If your lender doesn’t have access to ACE, you can apply for a Certificate 
of Eligibility by submitting a completed VA Form 26-1880. You can obtain 
this form from any VA regional center (see Appendix B) or print it from 
the VA’s Web site at www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-26-1880-
ARE.pdf.
 
 You should also include proof of your military service (see Chapter 2) 
along with your request. In some cases it may be possible for the VA to 
establish eligibility without your proof of service. However, to avoid any 
possible delays, it’s best to provide such evidence. Mail the completed 
application to VA Loan Eligibility Center, P.O. Box 20729, Winston-Salem, 
NC 27120. For overnight delivery, VA Loan Eligibility Center, 251 N. Main 
St., Winston-Salem, NC 27155.
 
5. Get a VA appraisal.
 
 The lender will ask the VA to assign a licensed appraiser to determine 
the reasonable value for the property. The appraiser will issue a 
Certificate of Reasonable Value.
 
 Although the VA appraiser must view the property from both the 
exterior and the interior to determine its overall condition, the appraisal 
process isn’t an inspection of the property. You should hire your 
own licensed inspector to satisfy yourself that the home you intend to 
purchase is in a condition that is acceptable to you. The VA guarantees 
only the loan, not the condition of the property. It’s your responsibility 
to be an informed buyer and assure yourself that what you are buying is 
satisfactory to you in all respects.
 
 You may be required to pay for the appraisal unless the seller agrees 
to pay. However, many lenders allow you to include this fee as part of 
the loan.
 
6. Play the waiting game.
 
 The lender will let you know the decision on the loan. You should be 
approved if the home’s established value and your credit and income 
are acceptable.

234
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
 
 Sometimes it may take longer than you expect for the lender or VA to 
process your loan application. For instance, your current or former 
employer may be slow in returning an employment verification form, 
or it may take some time to obtain a credit rating from out-of-state 
creditors. Ordinarily, you should plan on four to six weeks to obtain a 
decision on your application.
 
 Do not make any commitments based on an expected approval of your 
loan. You should not, for example, give notice to your landlord until the 
loan is approved by the lender and the VA. If you jump the gun, you may 
find yourself without a place to live.
 
7. Attend the loan closing.
 
 You (and your spouse) need to attend the loan closing. The lender or 
closing attorney will explain the loan terms and requirements, as well as 
where and how to make the monthly payments. During this meeting, you 
sign the note, mortgage, and other related papers.
 
8. Move in!
 
 You can now move into your new property. The loan is sent to the 
VA for guaranty. The VA annotates your Certificate of Eligibility to 
reflect the use of entitlement (the $36,000 or whatever amount was 
approved; see the “Knowing How Much Uncle Sam Will Guarantee” 
section for details) and returns it to you. Congratulations! You’re now a 
homeowner.
Before You Sign up: VA Home 
Loan Restrictions
The VA Home Loan Program sounds pretty nifty, doesn’t it? Unfortunately, 
it’s not all a bed of roses. You should be aware of several factors when 
deciding whether a VA home loan is the best option for you.
 
✓ Defaulting is a no-no. Just because the VA guarantees a portion of your 
loan doesn’t mean that guarantee is a gift to you. It must be repaid, 
just as you must repay any money you borrow. The VA guaranty, which 
protects the lender against loss, encourages the lender to make a loan 
with terms favorable to the veteran. If you fail to make the payments you 
agreed to make, you may lose your home through foreclosure, and you 
and your family would probably lose all the time and money you had 
invested in the house. If the lender does take a loss, VA must pay the 
guaranty to the lender, and you then owe that amount to the federal 
government.
 
 Trust me, owing the government money is not a situation you want 
to be in. It can result in liens against property and bank accounts, 
garnishment of wages, and forfeiture of any future income tax refunds.

235
 Chapter 13: Financing Your Dream House: VA Home Loan Guarantees
 
 If your loan closed on or after January 1, 1990, you will only owe the 
government if the default involved fraud, misrepresentation, or bad 
faith on your part. The VA makes the determination on a case-by-case 
basis. For example, if you’re still in the military and you knew you had 
change of assignment orders that would preclude you from meeting the 
initial occupancy requirements, the VA considers that “bad faith.” Of 
course, if you disagree with the VA’s decision, you can appeal it using 
the procedures explained in Chapter 3.
 
 If you default on a VA home loan, you can’t get another one until you 
repay the VA for its losses. This is true even if the VA determines you 
aren’t required to repay the government.
 
✓ You can’t use the benefit again until your loan is paid in full. You can 
reestablish your eligibility to use the VA Home Loan Program as long as 
the property you previously financed under the program has been sold 
and the loan has been paid in full. Alternatively, if you sell the home to 
another qualified veteran, and that veteran agrees to assume the remain-
ing loan balance using her VA home loan eligibility, you can use the 
benefit again.
 
 If you have repaid the prior VA loan in full and you still own the prop-
erty, you can get another loan guaranteed by the VA. You can use this 
special provision only once in a lifetime.
 
 Any loss suffered by the VA (for example, a claim paid to a lender if a 
loan goes to foreclosure) must be repaid in full before the entitlement 
used on the loan can be restored.
 
✓ You have to pay a funding fee. A principle disadvantage of the VA 
Home Loan Program is that the law requires you to pay a funding fee. 
The fee you pay goes toward the cost of this benefit, reducing the cost 
to taxpayers.
 
 Often a lender will roll this fee into the amount of the loan. The amount 
of the fee depends on your status and the amount of down payment for 
the loan. Take a look at the following table to see what the funding fee 
will run you.

✓ You have to buy American. The VA home loan can’t be used to pur-
chase homes or properties outside of the United States and its territo-
ries (Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Northern 
Mariana Islands).
 
✓ You must live on the property, at least for a while. The purpose of the 
VA Home Loan Program isn’t to provide veterans with an avenue for 
purchasing investment property. One of the program’s rules is that you 
or your spouse must occupy the property within a reasonable time after 
closing. Reasonable time is defined as within 60 days after closing. In 
unusual cases, this time period can be extended with VA approval; 
however, anything beyond 12 months will not be considered reasonable.
 
 This doesn’t mean you have to live on the property for the duration of 
the loan, but you must be the first ones to live there. The law doesn’t 
prevent you from moving out and renting the property after the initial 
period of occupancy. The law doesn’t define how long you have to live 
there, but keep in mind that if you move out too quickly, the VA may 
consider this bad faith on your part if it determines that the certification 
you signed stating your intent to occupy the home was a sham.

T
he U.S. government operates two retirement homes for certain military 
veterans. The Gulfport campus, located in Gulfport, Mississippi, was 
originally established as the Naval Asylum in 1834, until the name was 
changed to the Naval Home in 1880. Primarily, its residents were veteran 
enlisted sailors and marines. The Soldiers’ Home in Washington, D.C., was 
established in 1851 as an “asylum for old and disabled veterans.” In 1947, 
when the Air Force became a separate service, the name was changed to the 
Soldiers’ and Airmen’s Home. Most who lived there were veteran enlisted 
Army soldiers and enlisted Air Force members.
Today these two retirement facilities are known as the Armed Forces 
Retirement Home – Gulfport and the Armed Forces Retirement Home – 
Washington. In this chapter, I describe the Washington, D.C., facility and 
let you know what you can expect from it — and how to apply!
I wish I could give you a tour of the Gulfport facility as well, but at press 
time, this new facility was still under construction after being damaged 
by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and nobody yet knows what it will offer. The 
Gulfport home is scheduled to reopen in late 2010 or early 2011. You can 
track the progress of the home’s reconstruction on the Armed Forces 
Retirement Home – Gulfport Web site at www.afrh.gov/afrh/gulf/gulf
campus.htm.

Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
 
In addition to the programs explained in this chapter, most states have one or 
more state-operated veterans retirement homes. These are often called “VA 
Homes.” For more information, contact the appropriate state veterans agency 
listed in Appendix A.
Moving In: Do You Qualify?
Not all military veterans are eligible to reside at the AFRH. Eligibility factors 
include your military rank, military status, age, physical and mental health at 
the time of admission, and criminal history.
What’s a retired officer to do?
Those who have spent more than 50 percent of 
their military careers as an officer aren’t eligible 
to reside at the Armed Forces Retirement 
Home.
In fact, there are no federally operated 
military retirement homes for veteran military 
officers. However, a few nonprofit agencies 
offer retirement communities specifically for 
former officers:
 ✓ Air Force Village West: This community is 
located adjacent to March Field in Riverside, 
California. This nonprofit community 
accepts career, reserve, or honorably 
discharged officers, as well as widows or 
widowers of officers from any service 
branch. For complete information, visit 
www.afvw.com.
 ✓ The Air Force Villages: This nonprofit retire-
ment community, located in San Antonio, 
Texas, accepts retired and honorably 
separated officers of all uniformed services 
and their spouses, widows, widowers, 
and senior family members, age 62 and 
up. You can visit its Web site at www.
airforcevillages.com.
 ✓ Falcons Landing: This nonprofit community 
accepts retired military officers, their 
spouses, and surviving spouses who 
haven’t remarried. The retirement home 
is located in Washington, D.C. More 
information is available at www.falcons
landing.org.
 ✓ Knollwood: Also located in Washington, 
D.C., this unique retirement community is 
for male and female officers and their 
female relatives. Regular and reserve male 
and female military officers of all uniformed 
services, their spouses, sisters, daughters, 
mothers, and mothers-in-law are eligible 
for residency. Visit the Knollwood Web site 
at www.armydistaff.org.
 ✓ Vinson Hall: This home is located just three 
miles from the nation’s capital in McLean, 
Virginia. Eligibility includes those who have 
served as a commissioned officer (includ-
ing warrant officer) in the uniformed 
services, and the widows, widowers, former 
spouses, dependents, or immediate family 
members of such officers. For details, visit 
www.vinsonhall.org.

239
 Chapter 14: There’s No Place Like (A Military Retirement) Home
Here are the basics on each qualification:
 
✓ Military rank: The Armed Forces Retirement Homes are not for commis-
sioned officers. Only those who spent at least 50 percent of their military 
service as an enlisted member, warrant officer, or what the Navy and 
Marines call a “limited-duty officer” are eligible. I list retirement home 
options for commissioned officers in the nearby sidebar “What’s a 
retired officer to do?”
 
✓ Military status: Your status as a veteran also plays a role in your eligibil-
ity. You can move into an AFRH if you’re a
 
• Veteran with 20 years or more of active-duty service and at least 60 
years old
 
• Veteran unable to earn a livelihood due to a service-connected 
disability (see Chapter 6)
 
• Veteran unable to earn a livelihood due to injuries, disease, or dis-
ability, and who served in a war theater or received hostile-fire pay
 
• Female veteran who served prior to 1948
 
✓ Staying fit for admission: At the time of admission, you need to be 
capable of self-care. That means
 
• Full mental competency (in other words, able to make rational 
decisions)
 
• Able to take care of your own personal needs
 
• Able to attend a central dining facility for meals
 
• Able to keep all medical appointments
 
• An ability to speak, hear, and see (with or without aids) to perform 
basic functions
 
• The ability to care for your own room (for example, make the bed 
and clean the bathroom, floors, and windows)
 
• Freedom from alcoholism, drug addictions, or mental disorders
 
 If you have a history of excessive alcohol or drug use, you’ll have to 
prove you’ve been sober for at least one continuous year. The sobriety 
must be documented in the form of three letters from rehab profession-
als, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) staff, or medical personnel (not from 
friends or neighbors). These letters must indicate that your treatment 
was successful and you are maintaining sobriety. Even so, such docu-
mentation doesn’t guarantee your acceptance at the AFRH. The admis-
sion staff decides on a case-by-case basis.

240
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
 
 If you qualify and are interested in residing at the AFRH, make your 
decision early. Don’t wait until it’s too late. If you wait until you develop 
a serious illness or are unable to take care of yourself, it’s too late to 
apply to live at the AFRH.
 
 If you require increased healthcare after you become a resident, 
assisted-living and long-term care are available at the campus.
 
 You need some kind of medical insurance to live at the AFRH, be it 
Medicare, Tricare (military healthcare; see Chapter 5), or a commercial 
insurance program. For more details, see the “Factoring in medical 
insurance” section.
 
✓ Married couples: Married couples are welcome at the AFRH, but both 
must be eligible in their own right.
 
✓ Criminal history: If you’ve been convicted of a felony, whether by 
civilian or military court, at any time in your life, you’re not eligible to 
reside at the AFRH. A felony is defined as any state, federal, or military 
offense in which the maximum permissible punishment exceeds one 
year in prison.
Two Homes, No Waiting
Members of Congress have long felt it was inefficient for the military services 
to operate their own retirement homes. (Remember when the Department of 
Defense was spending $500 on hammers and $2,000 on toilet seats?) In 1999, 
having nothing better to do that particular legislative year, Congress moved 
the responsibility for operations and maintenance of the two homes from 
the Department of the Navy and Department of the Army to an independent 
establishment in the executive branch of the federal government known as 
the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH).
Not through fiddling with it, two years later Congress declared it wasn’t 
right having soldiers and airmen living in Washington, D.C., and sailors and 
marines living on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Why can’t we all just get 
along? Again, they waived their magical legislative wands and renamed the 
U.S. Naval Home and the U.S. Soldiers’ and Airmen’s Home as the Armed 
Forces Retirement Home – Gulfport and the Armed Forces Retirement 
Home – Washington, respectively. Now eligible veterans of any branch can 
live in either home. Of course, that was true before, but with the name 
changes, it’s more evident.

241
 Chapter 14: There’s No Place Like (A Military Retirement) Home
Gulfport: Whacked by a Hurricane, 
but on the Road to Recovery
Unfortunately, the Gulfport facility isn’t there right now. But don’t worry, it’ll 
be back! On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina visited her destructive fury 
on the Gulf Coast, decimating the 44-acre Gulfport campus. More than 150 
years of history and tradition were wiped out in a single day as the massive 
storm roared through. Like many in that devastated part of the country, the 
416 veteran residents of the Gulfport AFRH were left homeless.
Plans were implemented immediately to rescue the stranded veterans. The 
independent-living residents were bused to the Washington campus, while 
those who required assisted care were flown there from nearby Maxwell Air 
Force Base. Long-term care residents were relocated to Lynnwood Nursing 
Home in Mobile, Alabama.
All retirement homes are not created the same
When you think of a retirement home, maybe 
you envision a cross between a hospital and a 
jail: plain, unimpressive facilities consisting of 
white walls, devoid of décor and personality; 
long, gleaming corridors of shining, yellow tile; 
the entire structure smelling of stale disinfec-
tant. Inmates — I mean, residents — are told 
when to sleep, when to wake up, when to eat, 
and what “fun,” rigidly organized activities they 
will endure that particular day of the week.
My grandmother lived for several years in 
such a facility. When I would visit on one of my 
infrequent trips to my hometown, it was always 
easy to find her; she would be in her room 
(which she shared with two other residents), 
the dining room, or the organized activities 
room. I hated that she had to live there, but 
when your only income is Social Security, what 
are the alternatives?
One time on a business trip to our nation’s cap-
ital, at my mother’s insistence, I visited my 
Uncle Tim, a military veteran who resides at the 
Armed Forces Retirement Home. While I most 
certainly love my uncle and wanted to see him, 
I dreaded the visit because of the dark, gloomy 
mood I knew the facility would leave me in. Was 
I ever in for a shock! When I first entered the 
campus, I was stunned by the majestic build-
ings, rolling hills, and tranquil lakes that adorn 
the 272 acres of pristine grounds.
Want to know where I finally found my 
beloved uncle? He was on the second hole of 
the facility’s private, nine-hole golf course. The 
only gloomy mood I was in for that day was 
when my 76-year-old uncle beat me by three 
strokes.

242
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
For more than a year, Congress debated the future of the Gulfport 
home. Many lawmakers wanted to close the Gulfport campus, expand the 
Washington facility, and operate just one military retirement home. A few 
wanted to repair the existing facilities. Congress finally agreed that the best 
option was to completely rebuild on the existing grounds.
In October 2007, the storm-damaged facility was imploded. Army engineers 
really love it when they get to set off explosives. In February 2008, construc-
tion began on the $140 million, 660,000-square-foot main facility. When the 
project is completed in late 2010 or early 2011, the Gulfport campus will 
have space for 584 residents, including independent living, assisted care, and 
long-term care. The new grounds will feature controlled parking and com-
plete landscaping of the entire site, including walking paths, outdoor areas, 
and recreation areas.
Visiting the Washington Campus
The Washington campus of the Armed Forces Retirement Home is located on 
272 acres, smack-dab in the heart of our nation’s capital. The campus is just 
minutes away from the White House, the Capitol, and many other national 
monuments. The main building has housed four U.S. presidents, so if you see 
a sign that says, “Lincoln slept here,” it’s really true!
 
I can’t possibly cover everything about the Washington AFRH in these pages. 
To see photos of the campus and to get more details about what it offers, 
check out www.afrh.gov/afrh/wash/washcampus.htm.
Living the high life in retirement
I live in a fairly upscale private community. In other words, they charge me 
an arm and a leg to live here. I wish we had even a tenth of the amenities 
offered by the Armed Forces Retirement Home. The Washington campus is 
actually a city within a city, featuring everything you could need for daily 
living. Check out the following sections for the lowdown on the luxuries.
The necessities
When it comes down to what you need from a retirement home, you want a 
place to lay your head and have a meal. Having someone to take care of you 
when you’re under the weather is nice, too. Here’s what the AFRH offers:
 
✓ 1,021 private rooms for independent living: Each room is air condi-
tioned and equipped with a twin bed, desk, chair, and a reading lamp. If 
you want, you can even bring some of your own furniture so you won’t 
miss that favorite recliner.

243
 Chapter 14: There’s No Place Like (A Military Retirement) Home
 
 All new residents are assigned to the Scott Building, in which the 
average room size is about 130 square feet of living space, plus a private 
bathroom, shower, and walk-in closet. After you become a resident, you 
can put your name on the waiting list to reside in the Sheridan Building, 
where the rooms are 180 square feet. The rooms are wired for cable 
and telephone, but if you want such services, you’ll have to arrange 
that yourself with local cable and telephone companies. The home also 
provides linens and towels, which are laundered by a private contractor. 
Don’t expect maid service, though. You have to keep your own room 
clean, just like Mom made you do when you were a kid. This isn’t a 
hotel, after all.
 
✓ Dining facilities: The AFRH features not one, but two full-service dining 
facilities, both serving three meals a day, planned by licensed nutrition-
ists. Nutritional counseling is available.
 
 The meals are served buffet style (all-you-can-eat — like a cruise ship). 
You can choose which line to go through — the regular one for home-
style meals or the diet line for those who prefer low-calorie choices. 
If you don’t like the entrée on the buffet, the short-order station is 
happy to take your order for hamburgers, hot dogs, grilled chicken 
sandwiches, grilled cheese, and fries. And if you’re a diabetic, you can 
head to a separate meal station for specialized food for your condition.
 
 The staff provides individual table service for those who can’t serve 
themselves through the buffet stations. Each meal period lasts about 
three hours, and you can come and go as you please.
 
 If you get a case of the munchies or want to join your friends for a tall, 
cold one, you can hit the lounge, which stays open late into the evening 
hours and serves beer and snacks.
 
✓ Medical facilities: You can receive basic medical, dental, and vision 
care and physical therapy on campus. Services that aren’t available on 
campus are offered at nearby facilities. You can also get your prescrip-
tions filled at the campus pharmacy. I cover the specifics of medical care 
in the “Examining Your Healthcare Options” section later in this chapter.
Exercise and outdoor activities
You can keep up your active lifestyle after you move into the Armed Forces 
Retirement Home. Whether you want to fish, join a fitness class, or take quiet 
walks by yourself, you can find an activity that suits your interests.
 
✓ Golf course: There’s nothing quite like sinking the first putt on a lush, 
green golf course on a perfect balmy day. The AFRH features a nine-hole 
golf course nestled among its grounds. At 2,530 yards, the course isn’t 
long, but it’s challenging. The course plays to a par of 35; the first hole is 
a 460-yard par 5, and then you tee off on two challenging par 3s and six 
par 4s that range from 225 to 370 yards. You can even play the golf 
course twice from two sets of tees to make an 18-hole round.

244
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
 
 If one day you don’t feel like moving around the course, you can take a 
few swings at the driving range instead. Clubs and golf carts are avail-
able to residents.
 
✓ Bowling alley: How many retirement homes have their own bowling 
alleys? The AFRH most certainly does. It’s not very large, consisting of 
only six lanes, but how many lanes do you need, really? The center hosts 
bowling leagues almost nightly and tournaments throughout the year for 
the community’s residents.
 
✓ Fitness center: If the legendary Jack LaLanne were a resident of the 
AFRH, he would certainly be impressed by the modern fitness center. 
The spacious center includes several treadmills, stationary bikes, 
resistance training equipment, and much more. In addition to the many 
pieces of exercise equipment, you can also take advantage of fitness 
classes, personal trainers, and free weights.
 
 If indoor fitness isn’t your cup of sports drink, you can take your 
exercise regimen outside to several walking trails, including a life trail. 
(This is a walking/jogging trail with various low-impact exercise stations 
interspersed along the trail.)
 
 After an energizing workout, you can take a few minutes to relax those 
tired muscles and clear the stress from your mind in the fitness center 
sauna.
 
✓ Fishing ponds: Have you heard about the big one that got away? Well, 
there’s nowhere for the fish to run in AFRH’s two fishing ponds. The 
ponds are generously stocked with crappie, bass, bream, and catfish, 
which means you won’t have to wait too long between bites.
 
 Want to prove you’re the champion fisherman? Fishing rodeos are 
conducted frequently throughout the year. Be nice to the kitchen staff 
and maybe they’ll even agree to cook up your catch for lunch.
Entertainment and educational resources
If you like to be entertained and educated, you won’t be disappointed by 
the AFRH’s offerings. You can catch the latest movie, borrow the newest 
bestseller, and hit your favorite Web sites.
 
✓ Movie theater: No need to go out and spend 50 bucks for a movie and 
stale gummi bears. The AFRH has its own movie theater. This 667-seat, 
fully equipped theater not only hosts the latest movies, but also serves 
as the gathering place for periodic community meetings, bingo, special 
events, and live entertainment.
 
✓ Library: Unlike many commercial retirement homes, this isn’t just a 
room in the corner with a few old paperbacks. The AFRH boasts a huge, 
full-service library with thousands of books, and it even employs a full-
time librarian to keep things organized and help you find what you need. 
Maybe you’ll even find a copy of Veterans Benefits For Dummies there. 
Also available for checkout are all kinds of movies in both VHS and DVD 
format.

245
 Chapter 14: There’s No Place Like (A Military Retirement) Home
 
✓ Computer room: It seems as if none of us can live without our comput-
ers these days. At the AFRH, you don’t have to. Residents are welcome 
to bring their own computers to surf the Internet from their rooms 
via DSL, or you can take advantage of the facility’s 24-hour computer 
room. There’s also a computer lab where you can learn to become a 
professional driver on the information superhighway.
Everything else
It would take this entire book to fully describe all the amenities offered 
to residents at the AFRH (and then I’d have to change the title of the book). 
The list of goodies available goes on and on:
✓ Art studio
✓ Auto hobby shop
✓ Bank
✓ Barber shop
✓ Beauty salon
✓ Bike shop
✓ Card rooms
✓ Ceramics studio
✓ Chapel
✓ Convenience store
✓ Craft cottage
✓ Garden plots
✓ Ham radio room
✓ Listening room
✓ Puzzle room
✓ Sports lounge
✓ Woodshop
Is smoking allowed?
If you smoke, you should quit. All the doctors 
say so, and we want to keep you around so you 
can read more great For Dummies books, like 
this one.
However, if you’re unwilling or unable to quit, 
the AFRH offers smoking rooms, as well as des-
ignated smoking areas within the facility. 
Nonsmokers can request to be assigned to a 
nonsmoking room or even a nonsmoking floor.

246
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
Going out and about: Cars 
and transportation
Residents at the AFRH are free to come and go as they please. If you’ve got a 
hot date and don’t get home until 2 a.m., no problem. Some residents have 
jobs in the area and spend all day off campus. Many others choose to enjoy 
the world-class theaters, museums, restaurants, and attractions in the 
metropolitan area. Some even periodically jaunt over to nearby Andrews Air 
Force Base and jump on a military aircraft for space-available, free flights to 
Europe.
If you’re medically capable of driving and have a valid driver’s license, you 
can have your own car at the AFRH. The facility has plenty of free parking for 
residents. If you’re handy with a wrench, you can even change the oil at the 
auto hobby shop.
If you don’t have a car or don’t want to hassle with driving in the city’s traffic, 
you can catch the Washington, D.C., Metrobus, which stops right outside of 
the front gate. From there it’s just a short ride to the D.C. Metrorail stations 
at Fort Totten and Brookland. From those two stations, you can travel to 
almost anywhere in the D.C. area.
In addition, the AFRH provides scheduled daily transportation to nearby 
hospitals, including Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Washington 
VA Medical Center.
Trips and special events are planned each month. Residents can sign up 
for daytrips to local events and attractions almost any day of the week, 
as well as take advantage of overnight trips. Not long ago, the staff of the 
AFRH Recreation Services Division hosted an eight-day cruise to the 
Caribbean.
Getting there
The folks at the AFRH love it when prospective residents come to visit. In 
fact, you, as a retired veteran considering taking up residence there, and 
your family are entitled to complimentary lodging in a guest room for two 
nights and a limited number of meals at the Washington campus. You can 
schedule a visit by calling 800-422-9988 and making an appointment.
 
Guest rooms are not available just for prospective residents. Friends and 
family visiting residents at the Washington campus can also reserve guest 
rooms. The prices range from $25 to $40 per night, depending on the type of 
room. Try to match that price anywhere else in Washington, D.C.! Meals are 
very reasonable too, at $6 per meal (all-you-can-eat), and children under 3 eat 
free. Call 202-730-3014 for a reservation.

Paying for Your New Home
The cost of residing at the AFRH depends on how much money you make 
each month — both taxable and nontaxable income.
 
✓ Taxable income means all income reportable as adjusted gross income 
(AGI) on your U.S. income tax return.
 
✓ Nontaxable income includes benefits administered by the Department 
of Veterans Affairs, Social Security Administration, disability retired 
pay, pensions, annuities, and IRA distributions that aren’t included in 
your AGI.
Actual cost is based on a percentage of your income and the level of care you 
require:
 
✓ Independent-living residents: 35 percent of total current income, but 
not to exceed $1,170 each month
 
✓ Assisted-living residents: 40 percent of total current income, but not to 
exceed $1,754 each month
 
✓ Long-term care residents: 65 percent of total current income, but not to 
exceed $2,924 each month

Like anything else in life, these rates are subject to change. For the latest 
rates, visit www.afrh.gov/afrh/newres/elig/elig_fees.htm.
 
When you first move in to the AFRH, you must be capable of independent care 
(see the earlier section “Moving In: Do You Qualify”). When and if your care 
needs change, your cost will increase accordingly.
 
Believe it or not, no taxpayer money is used in the operations of the AFRH. 
How do the administrators offer such an array of amenities at such a modest 
cost? The AFRH is one of the few veteran benefits that potential future recipients 
pay for while they’re still in the military. Fifty cents per month is deducted 
from the military pay of all active-duty enlisted members. The mandatory 
deduction, along with funds garnered from fines and forfeitures of military 
disciplinary actions, are placed in the AFRH trust fund.
Examining Your Healthcare Options
The AFRH provides a continuum of care, including outpatient, dental, and 
medical services; hospital care; and long-term nursing care.
Staying on campus for treatment
Services for primary care and basic dental, vision, and podiatry services are 
available on the campus. Additionally, there are on-campus programs in 
urology, psychiatry, internal medicine, and COPD. There’s even a pharmacy 
on the campus.
For those requiring special treatment for a disability, the home has trained 
and licensed therapists for physical therapy, occupational therapy, recre-
ational therapy, and speech-language pathology.
The on-site, 200-bed King Health Center for primary, intermediate, and skilled 
healthcare is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of 
Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO).
Going off campus for care
Off-site care is provided by the renowned Washington Hospital Center, the 
Washington VA Medical Center, the George Washington Hospital, and Walter 
Reed Army Medical Center. Of course, the AFRH provides free transportation 
to these facilities, which certainly helps with your gas, taxi, or bus budget.

249
 Chapter 14: There’s No Place Like (A Military Retirement) Home
Factoring in medical insurance
There’s no such thing as a free lunch. The same is true of medical care 
offered at the AFRH. It’s not free. You’ll need some type of medical insurance 
to be accepted as a resident. The exact type depends on your status:
 
✓ Medicare A & B are mandatory prior to admission to AFRH for those 
who qualify.
 
✓ Military retirees under 65 with no Medicare benefits are required to 
obtain Tricare Prime at their cost. See Chapter 5 for more information 
about Tricare.
 
✓ Military retirees under 65 with Medicare benefits must obtain Tricare 
Prime as secondary coverage. There’s no cost for this coverage.
 
✓ Military retirees over 65 with no Medicare benefits are required to 
obtain Tricare Prime.
 
✓ Nonmilitary retirees with Medicare benefits are required to have a 
Medicare supplement, enroll in a Medicare HMO if available, or enroll in 
Medicaid if eligible.
 
✓ Nonmilitary retirees with a 100 percent service-connected disability 
are required to use the nearby VA or military facilities, which support 
the AFRH.
 
✓ Nonmilitary retirees under 65 with no Medicare and VA benefits and 
who are ineligible for Medicaid would need to purchase a major medical 
insurance policy.
What Are You Waiting For? Apply Now!
At the time of this publication, there was no waiting list for the Armed Forces 
Retirement Home in Washington, D.C. Assuming you qualify, you can apply 
now and be enjoying luxury retirement living in three or four weeks.
The application process involves three basic steps: gathering your docu-
ments, obtaining a physical, and completing your application.
Gathering the required documents
The Armed Forces Retirement Home is, of course, a government organiza-
tion, which means it can’t operate without paperwork. Here are the 
documents you should gather before submitting your application:
 
✓ DD Form 214, Record of Military Service, or Statement of Service 
summary. See Chapter 1 for more information.

250
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
 
✓ A copy of your federal tax return for the most recent tax year. If you’re 
exempt from filing, you must provide verification of all income for the 
most recent year (W-2s, 1099s, all investments and savings).
 
✓ Documentation of the gross amount you’re entitled to from all federal 
payments (civil service retired pay, military retired pay, Social Security, 
VA compensation or pension, and so on).
 
✓ Verification of current year Medicare Part B premium and supplemental 
insurance payment (or proof of Tricare enrollment).
 
✓ Proof of payment for other health insurance.
Obtaining a medical physical
As mentioned in the “Moving In: Do You Qualify?” section earlier in this 
chapter, you must be capable of self-care when you first move into the AFRH. 
To certify that you meet the minimum medical standards for admission, you 
must obtain a physical from your doctor.
You can download a copy of the medical examination form at the AFRH 
Web site at www.afrh.gov/afrh/forms/forms_medical.pdf, or call 
800-422-9988 and ask for an application packet.
The physical must include a PPD screening test for tuberculosis. A positive 
result won’t necessarily deny you residency, but a chest X-ray will be 
required.
Completing your application
You can download the six-page application for admission at www.afrh.gov/
afrh/forms/forms_app.pdf, or obtain one by calling 800-422-9988. To 
avoid delays, make sure you provide thorough and accurate information. 
Mail the completed application and supporting documents to AFRH, PAO/
Marketing #1305, 3700 N. Capitol St., NW, Washington, DC 20011-8400.
 
The online application form is interactive. You can complete the application 
while online, and then print and sign it to include in your application packet.
Upon receipt of your packet, the AFRH takes four to six days to process the 
application and make a decision. That’s pretty darn fast for a government 
agency.
After the decision is made, the staff at the Armed Forces Retirement Home 
will call you and follow up in writing with an official notification. Then all you 
have to do is pack your bags, notify your friends and relatives of your new 
address, and move into your new home. Good luck!

M
y girlfriend loves this chapter because it’s all about shopping. That 
woman treats shopping like it’s a full-time career. Shopping For 
Dummies? I think I need to give my publisher a call.
Everyone loves a good bargain. Even in times of high gas prices, I know 
people who will drive halfway across town because soda is on sale.
Some of the best bargains around can be found on military bases. Established 
primarily for active-duty members and their dependents, on-base exchanges 
and commissaries sell goods and services at a substantial discount over their 
civilian competitors.
But you don’t have to be a current member of the military to share in this 
shopping bonanza. Certain categories of veterans and family members are 
also entitled to shop on military installations. In this chapter, I tell you more 
about this military perk and who is qualified to use it.
Getting Familiar with the Military 
Exchange System
I run into civilians all the time who think, as a military retiree, I can buy a 
suit at the Base Exchange for $20 or pick up a $2,000 stereo system for $500. 
Although military exchanges can save you money, they certainly don’t 

252
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
produce the gigantic savings that many civilians think they do. However, 
savings can be especially substantial for large-ticket items because they’re 
located on federal military bases, and sales are not subject to state sales tax.
 
The military exchange system is most certainly the king of nonappropriated 
fund activities. Nonappropriated fund activities are government activities 
that don’t use taxpayer money. The exchange systems fund their operating 
budgets (civilian employee salaries, inventory investments, utilities, and 
capital investments for equipment, vehicles, and facilities) from the sale of 
merchandise, food, and services to customers.
There are four exchange systems:
 
✓ The Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES)
 
✓ The Navy Exchange Service (NEXCOM)
 
✓ The Marine Corps Exchange (MCX)
 
✓ The Coast Guard Exchange (CGX)
Why four? Because it’s always been that way. There has been some talk 
about combining the four systems into one exchange service, but so far 
that’s all it’s been, just talk. Even though there are four separate exchanges, 
qualified veterans and family members can use any of them. In other words, 
if you’re an Air Force veteran, you can still shop in Marine Corps exchanges 
and vice versa.
The exchange systems operate most of the shopping activities on military 
installations, including the BXs, PXs, gas stations, movie theaters, food 
concessions, uniform sales, and liquor stores. More on those in the following 
sections.
 
Exchanges are located on military bases. Even tiny little military bases will 
have an exchange, although it may be the size of a 7-Eleven gas station. 
The general rule is the bigger the military base, the larger the exchange. 
A listing of major military bases located in the United States can be found at 
usmilitary.about.com/od/theorderlyroom/l/blstatefacts.htm.
Saving money at BXs, PXs, and other Xs
A rose by any other name would still require fertilizer, and the same holds 
true for a military store’s name. Soldiers call it a PX, which is short for post 
exchange. Airmen say BX, for base exchange. Sailors call it a ship’s store when 
afloat and NEX when in port. Marines say MCX; to the Coast Guardsmen, it’s 
CGX. I mention all of these so if you need to ask for directions, you can call 
the store by its military name. That way some snooty person won’t correct 
your use of terminology.

253
 Chapter 15: Shopping Until You Drop
Regardless of whether it’s called a BX or PX, the stores are the military’s 
version of Wal-Mart. Exchanges can be very, very large, or relatively modest, 
depending on the size and type of community (active duty, retired, and 
dependent) they are designed to support.
The military claims that customers who shop at BXs and PXs save an average 
of 17 to 20 percent compared with off-base stores. That is over and above the 
savings derived from the exclusion of sales taxes. From time to time, you can 
find off-base establishments selling an item on sale, cheaper than the BX/PX, 
but the exchanges combat this with a program called price matching. If an 
exchange customer finds an identical item in the local community selling for 
a price lower than the BX/PX’s price, the exchange will match the price.
Not a fly-by-night operation
The exchange services aren’t minor-league 
players in the field of retail sales. The Army and 
Air Force Exchange System alone (AAFES; the 
largest of the four exchange systems) operates 
more than 3,000 facilities worldwide, in more 
than 30 countries, 5 U.S. territories, and 49 
states. (Oregon doesn’t have any Army or Air 
Force bases. It does, however, have Navy and 
Coast Guard bases, so veterans can still get 
their shopping fix.) AAFES operates some 143 
retail stores and more than 2,200 fast-food res-
taurants, such as Taco Bell, Burger King, 
Popeyes, and Cinnabon.
The Navy Exchange (NEXCOM) oversees 107 
Navy Exchange facilities, 344 stores worldwide, 
and 45 Navy Lodges, as well as Ship Stores, the 
Navy Uniform Program, and Navy Family 
Support Program.
The Marine Corps Exchange (MCX) currently 
operates 17 main exchanges, 96 branch and 
convenience stores, 17 package stores, 27 ser-
vices stations, 13 military clothing stores, and 
services like vending machines, dry cleaning, 
and rentals.
The Coast Guard, our nation’s smallest military 
branch, operates exchanges in 23 states and 
one U.S. territory (Puerto Rico). On average, 
Coast Guard exchanges are much smaller than 
their sister-service counterparts. However, 
because Coast Guard bases are often in remote 
locations, their exchanges often offer merchan-
dise at little or no profit to the exchange. Some 
of the best deals can be found in these 
exchanges.
In fiscal year 2007, AAFES revenues totaled $9.7 
billion and earnings totaled $441.7 million. 
NEXCOM garnered $2.5 billion in sales and more 
than $40 million in profits. MCX sales totaled 
$774 million and resulted in profits exceeding 
$45 million.
So what do the exchanges do with all those 
profits? The majority of it (roughly two-thirds) is 
used to fund various military morale, welfare, 
and recreation (MWR) quality-of-life programs, 
such as youth services, Armed Forces 
Recreation Centers, swimming pools, arts and 
crafts, military social functions, and golf 
courses.
The remaining earnings are used to build new 
stores or renovate existing facilities. Funds to 
build these new or replacement facilities come 
entirely from the sale of merchandise and 
services, not taxpayer money.

254
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
BXs and PXs accept MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover credit 
cards. Exchanges also offer their own credit plan through the joint-exchange 
Military Star Card. Exchanges also cash personal checks at no charge with a 
valid military or dependent ID card. More on ID cards later in the chapter.
Name brands galore
The BXs and PXs sell famous name-brand merchandise like American West, 
Babies 1st, Bobby Jones, Dreamgirl, Coach, Gucci, Island Surf, Hot Topic, 
Magic Silk, Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba, and Wearguard at bargain prices.
A common complaint about the BX/PX I’ve heard over the years is that they 
may lean too much toward high-priced, name-brand items. Many low-ranking 
enlisted folks, retirees, and other veterans can’t afford Dooney & Bourke 
handbags, no matter how good the savings. They would rather buy an off-
brand purse from Wal-Mart at half the price. Over the past few years, the 
exchanges have addressed this criticism by offering private-label merchan-
dise, found exclusively at military exchanges, with the same quality as 
national brands at significant savings.
Your mileage may vary. I took my girlfriend shopping with me at the Keesler 
Air Force Base exchange a couple of years ago. She was absolutely thrilled 
with the selections and prices in the BX. That one shopping trip set me back 
several hundred dollars, but I was assured by my sweetie that we scored the 
bargains of the century.
Carousing through the catalog
I remember as a young airman anxiously awaiting the arrival of the annual 
exchange mail-order catalogs. The pages of these giant volumes contained 
thousands of items you could purchase from the exchange, many of which 
were not carried on the shelves of the local BX/PX.
The exchange services still publish the annual mail-order catalogs. Auth-
orized shoppers can browse through the color pages and order merchandise 
to be shipped to their homes. This is handy for veterans who don’t have a 
computer and don’t live close to a military base. Of course, you usually have 
to pay for shipping, but think of the gas you’ll save. Like other exchange 
sales, there’s no sales tax.
 
Catalogs cost five bucks but include a coupon for $10 off your first order. To 
order an exchange catalog, call 800-527-2345. You can also order exchange 
catalogs online. See the next section.
Unveiling merchandise online
I know what you’re thinking. Who shops by mail order these days (see the 
preceding section)? Online shopping is the thing now. Don’t worry. The 

255
 Chapter 15: Shopping Until You Drop
exchanges have kept up with the times. Anything you can buy in the catalogs, 
you can also purchase through the exchange’s online sites. Like catalog sales, 
you’ll usually have to pay for shipping, but there’s no sales tax.
The secure sites will verify your exchange privileges against the Defense 
Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) database. To begin your 
online shopping spree, visit:
 
✓ Army and Air Force Exchange: www.aafes.com
 
✓ Navy Exchange: www.navy-nex.com
 
✓ Marine Corps Exchange: www.usmc-mccs.org/shopping
 
✓ Coast Guard Exchange: www.cg-exchange.com
Giving the gift of shopping
The exchanges sell gift cards in their stores and through their online sites. 
The military exchange system offers a program called Gifts from the Home-
front, through which individuals can buy gift cards for donation to deployed 
troops, who can then use the cards to shop at exchanges in their theater of 
operation.
 
You don’t have to be an authorized exchange shopper to purchase a gift card 
for deployed service members through the Gifts from the Homefront program.
You can’t have everything
One thing you won’t get a great deal on in the BXs and PXs is tobacco 
products. The prices for these products are only marginally cheaper than 
retail stores off-base. This is because of an ongoing Department of Defense 
program to reduce smoking in the military. Under DOD regulations, the 
maximum discount for tobacco products is 5 percent less than the most 
competitive price in the local community for BXs/PXs located in the United 
States. For overseas exchanges, tobacco prices must fall within the range of 
the average U.S. prices.
Also, over the years, Congress has passed various laws that restrict what can 
be sold in military exchanges. This is to protect selected retail industries 
from what they view as “unfair competition.” These restrictions apply 
mostly to BXs and PXs located in the United States. (Apparently Congress 
doesn’t care much about the exchange system competing with overseas 
retail establishments.) Stateside exchanges can’t sell cars, fur coats, or major 
appliances, for example. Congress has also limited the size of diamonds and 
types of furniture that can be sold in exchanges located in the United States. 
Exchanges can sell some finished furniture, although any one piece can’t cost 
more than $900.

256
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
Feasting at eating establishments
After you wander around the BX/PX looking at all the stuff you can buy (see 
the preceding section), you’ll probably start to get hungry. It’s most certainly 
not hard to find something to eat on a military base, and I’m not talking about 
the chow halls. The exchanges operate a variety of eating establishments on 
military installations.
Almost every BX and PX sports a food court, just like the food courts in 
American malls. Here you can satisfy your hunger pangs with salads, 
submarine sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, pizza, ice cream, and more. You 
may even find a Taco Bell here and there. In my humble opinion, a hot 
meatball sub from Robin Hood (a submarine sandwich shop that operates in 
many BX/PX food courts) can’t be beat.
Outside of the food courts, you’ll find familiar fast-food establishments, such 
as McDonald’s, Popeyes, and Burger King, scattered throughout the base. 
These franchises operate through subcontracts with the military exchange 
system.
Shave and a haircut, and dental care, too!
Military bases are like small cities, so they have barber shops, beauty shops, 
video rental stores, one-hour photo shops, laundromats and dry cleaners, 
tailor shops, bookstores, florists, and other essential services for day-to-day 
living. On military bases, these activities are operated by subcontractors that 
are managed by the exchange system.
Several bases have optometry and audiology clinics operated as concessions. 
These clinics are run by private contractors that are overseen by local 
military medical officials. Navy clinics are run by private contractors with 
no military medical oversight.
AAFES even operates a dental clinic for family members at Fort Hood, Texas, 
and the Marine Corps offers the same at Camp Pendleton, California, to help 
relieve a shortage of dental staff there. Fees are comparable to those under 
the Tricare Dental Program (see Chapter 5).
Military clothing: Getting your 
uniform ready for the parade
The military services have regulations that allow certain veterans to wear 
their uniforms at certain times, such as when attending a patriotic event. But 

257
 Chapter 15: Shopping Until You Drop
what’s a veteran going to do if he discovers his valued uniform, which has 
been hanging in the closet for the past 15 years, doesn’t fit quite the way it 
used to? Never fear — a clothing sales store may be near!
The exchange services operate military clothing stores on military bases 
where authorized shoppers can purchase military uniforms and accessories. 
Uniform items can also be purchased through the online exchange sites 
(see the “Unveiling merchandise online” section).
 
Clothing stores base their inventory on the primary population on that partic-
ular base. In other words, it’s going to be hard to find an Air Force uniform 
item on a Marine Corps base. If you need to purchase a new uniform or uni-
form item, it’s best to visit the branch base that corresponds with the item 
needed. If you need an Army uniform, visit an Army post; veteran sailors 
should visit a Navy base clothing store; and so on.
Gassing up at military gas stations
The exchange services also operate the gas stations on military bases. Many 
of these operations also include a car-care center where you can get your car 
fixed if it breaks down.
Unfortunately, you won’t find bargain fuel prices at military gas stations. 
Although the exchange services aren’t subject to sales taxes on other items, 
the Hayden Cartwright Act does require the exchanges to pay fuel taxes. 
Additionally, this is another one of those “unfair competition” deals. Depart-
ment of Defense regulations require the exchanges to periodically survey 
local off-base service stations and set their fuel prices competitively. As such, 
fuel sold to military personnel, veterans, and family members on military 
installations is often sold at nearly the same rate as the rates at nearby civil-
ian locations.
 
Because surveys are generally performed only once or twice per month, it’s 
not uncommon to find stations in surrounding communities selling fuel for 
several cents less per gallon than at the military gas stations.
Locating the liquor
The exchange services also operate liquor stores on military bases. These 
are sometimes called package stores, or Class 6 stores, a tradition carried on 
from before the mid-1980s, when the exchange services took over base liquor 
stores from appropriated fund activities.

258
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
Like tobacco products (see the earlier section “You can’t have everything”), 
you’re not going to get a substantial discount on liquor sales on military 
bases. This is because of the ongoing Department of Defense program to 
deglamorize alcohol use by military personnel. Alcohol sold at exchanges 
can be sold for no less than 10 percent below the best price in Alcohol 
Beverage Control states, and no less than 5 percent below the competitive 
rate at non–Alcohol Beverage Control states.
 
Alcoholic Beverage Control states are those that have a state monopoly over 
the wholesaling and/or retailing of some or all of the categories of alcoholic 
beverages. Non–Alcoholic Beverage Control states are those that leave the 
regulation of alcohol sales to the local community, such as counties and cities. 
The 18 ABC states are Alabama, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, 
Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, 
Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
Taking in a movie at the base theater
If you’d rather kick back and relax while you’re on-base, you can check out 
the base’s movie theater, which is operated by the exchange service. It 
wasn’t that many years ago when seeing a movie on a military installation 
wasn’t worth the time, unless you didn’t have any transportation or were 
stationed overseas. Back then, movies weren’t distributed to military bases 
until about the same time they were available at video rental stores.
Then the exchange services took over the operation of on-base movie 
theaters. The exchanges now operate their own brand-name chain of 
theaters, called Reel Time Theaters.
Movies seen at theaters on military bases today are the same as the ones 
shown at off-base cinemas. For a night at the movies on a military base, 
expect to pay about 20 percent less, on average, than you would off-base. A 
few bases still offer movies for free, and others may occasionally sponsor 
free movie nights.

Commissaries: The Military Supermarket
Seems like the military exchange system has its hand in just about every-
thing, doesn’t it? Not quite. Military grocery stores aren’t operated by the 
exchange system. In fact, unlike military exchanges, the Defense Commissary 
Agency (DeCA) commissaries are appropriated fund activities. By that, I 
mean they are allowed to use taxpayer dollars for their operation and 
construction.

259
 Chapter 15: Shopping Until You Drop
 
DeCA operates 258 commissaries on military installations around the world. 
You can find super grocery savings near you by visiting DeCA’s Web site at 
www.commissaries.com.
Substantial savings on groceries
Commissaries operate under guidelines and procedures incorporated into 
federal law. Unlike the exchange services, which are allowed to make a 
profit, commissaries must sell their items for the same price they purchase 
them. A 5 percent surcharge is added to your purchase to help pay for 
normal operating costs and facility maintenance and construction.
Overall you save about 30 percent for grocery items over off-base retail 
stores. That means a family of four, shopping regularly, can save about $3,000 
per year, and a single member can save about $1,000 per year in grocery 
costs. The savings can be even greater if you live in a state that charges sales 
tax for groceries. Like exchange shopping, the commissary doesn’t charge 
sales tax.
Bragging about bagging
A welcome sight at military commissaries, especially to the older and 
disabled veterans, is the folks who bag the groceries. Baggers are often 
military dependents, off-duty military personnel trying to make a few extra 
bucks, and military retirees. They not only bag your groceries, but also take 
them out and load them into your car! How many supermarkets still do that?
Baggers don’t work for, nor are they paid by, the commissary. Instead, they 
work solely for tips. The average tip is between 5 and 10 percent of your 
grocery purchase.
 
Baggers aren’t paid by the commissary. If you don’t plan to tip, please decline 
the service while at the checkout line and bag your own purchases.
Online grocery shopping?
I wish I could order bread, milk, and snacks online. I hate grocery shopping, 
and I look forward to the day when DeCA will allow me to purchase my 
groceries online and have them delivered to my house.
While that day hasn’t yet arrived, authorized shoppers can purchase 
gourmet food gift packages, such as cheeses, baked goods, and chocolates, 
online through the “virtual commissary.” Simply visit www.commissaries.
com, choose “Shopping” from the pull-down menu, and select “Virtual 

260
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
Commissary.” You’ll be required to log in with your last name, Social Security 
number, and date of birth. Your data will then be compared with the DEERS 
database to ensure that you’re an eligible shopper.
Qualifying for ID Cards
Not all veterans are authorized to participate in shopping opportunities on 
military bases. Congress makes the laws concerning who can and can’t shop 
at military exchanges, commissaries, and other nonappropriated fund activi-
ties. However, there are numerous categories of military members, veterans, 
family members, and others who can enjoy the benefits of shopping on 
military installations.
Authorized customers must possess a military or dependent identification 
card. These are the same ID cards issued for other military benefits, includ-
ing travel (see Chapter 16) and Tricare (see Chapter 5). Customers who can 
have cards are current military members, certain veterans, and family mem-
bers, including
 
✓ Military members on active duty.
 
✓ Members of the active (drilling) National Guard or reserves.
 
✓ Retired active-duty members. Active-duty members can retire after per-
forming at least 20 years of active-duty service. See Chapter 7 for details.
 
✓ Retired National Guard and Reserve members who are receiving retired 
pay. Members of the Guard and Reserve generally begin receiving 
retired pay at age 60. Chapter 7 explains this in more detail.
 
✓ Veterans who have received the Medal of Honor.
 
✓ Honorably discharged veterans who have been rated as 100 percent 
disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) due to a service-
related injury. See Chapter 6 for information about how the VA rates 
disabilities.
 
✓ Dependents of those listed here. Dependents include a veteran’s spouse 
and children. A spouse usually loses entitlement upon divorce, unless 
certain conditions are met (see the “Exceptions for former spouses” 
section). Children include the legitimate, adopted, stepchild, or illegiti-
mate child of the member; illegitimate child of a spouse; or a ward. 
Children lose entitlement when they marry, or at age 21, unless they are 
incapable of self-care. This is extended to age 23 for children who are 
full-time students. It’s also possible to designate a father, mother, father-
in-law, mother-in-law, stepparent, or parent-by-adoption as a dependent, 
if the military member provides more than 50 percent of the relative’s 
support.

 Chapter 15: Shopping Until You Drop
 
Most BXs and PXs allow authorized shoppers to be accompanied by a guest. 
Such guests may not make any purchases, however. All purchases must be 
made by the authorized customer.
Exceptions for former spouses
In most cases of divorce between a military member and his spouse, the non-
military spouse will lose her ID card and privileges when the divorce is final, 
with two exceptions, known as the “20/20/20” rule and the “10/20/10” rule.
Under the 20/20/20 rule, full benefits are extended to an unmarried former 
spouse when all the following conditions are met:
 
✓ The couple had been married for at least 20 years
 
✓ The member performed at least 20 years of service creditable for retired 
pay (see Chapter 7 for more on military retirement)
 
✓ There was at least a 20-year overlap of the marriage and the military 
service
With the 10/20/10 rule, the former spouse retains full benefits if the military 
member was discharged for domestic abuse and the following conditions 
are met:
 
✓ The couple had been married for at least 10 years
 
✓ The member performed at least 20 years of service creditable for 
retired pay
 
✓ There was at least a 10-year overlap of the marriage and the military 
service
If the former spouse remarries, she loses her on-base shopping privileges. 
However, if she becomes widowed or divorces again, she regains the 
privileges.
Surviving family members
Under certain conditions, surviving family members of deceased military 
personnel are authorized to retain their ID cards, and thereby their on-base 
shopping privileges. You qualify if you are a surviving dependent of any of 
the following:
 
✓ Members who died while on active duty under orders that specified a 
period of duty of more than 30 days or members who died while in a 
retired-with-pay status.

262
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
 
✓ National Guard and Reserve members who died from an injury or illness 
that happened or was aggravated while on active duty for a period of 30 
days or less, on active duty for training, or on inactive-duty training, or 
while traveling to or from the place where the member was to perform, 
or performed, such duty.
 
✓ National Guard and Reserve members who qualified for retirement and 
were receiving retirement pay (turn to Chapter 7 for more on retiring).
 
✓ National Guard and Reserve members who qualified for retirement, but 
weren’t receiving pay because they hadn’t reached age 60. Dependents 
of these veterans can receive ID cards and begin their on-base shopping 
privileges on or after the date on which the member would have been 60 
years old had he survived.
 
✓ Honorably discharged veterans rated by the VA as 100 percent disabled 
because of a service-connected injury or disease (head to Chapter 6 for 
more details on disability ratings).
 
✓ Medal of Honor recipients.
 
If you are a surviving spouse who has authorized privileges under one of 
these categories, you lose those privileges if you remarry. If you then become 
widowed or divorced, you regain your shopping privileges.
Other authorized shoppers
Individual military base commanders can authorize other people to shop on-
base, if they determine that the base shopping capabilities won’t be affected. 
Others who may be given shopping privileges include
 
✓ Members in the Delayed Enlistment Program (DEP), waiting to ship out 
to basic training
 
✓ Civilian employees of the military and Red Cross who are working over-
seas at U.S. military installations
 
✓ Members of NATO and other allied forces who are stationed at U.S. 
military bases
 
✓ Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets in their last two years of 
training
 
✓ United Seaman’s Service (USS) personnel in foreign countries
 
✓ Dependents of anyone listed here (except DEP) when living in the same 
household

 Chapter 15: Shopping Until You Drop
How to Apply for Your ID Card
Most people who are eligible to receive a military or dependent ID card 
receive theirs in person at a military installation. A list of major military 
installations located in the United States can be viewed at usmilitary.
about.com/od/theorderlyroom/l/blstatefacts.htm.
When you arrive at the base, ask the guard at the gate to direct you to the ID 
card issuing facility. On most military bases, this is the customer service 
section of the base’s personnel function. Some bases may call this the “Pass 
and ID” section.
Make sure you bring any supporting documentation with you, such as proof 
of military service and disability status, applicable marriage certificates, birth 
certificates, divorce decrees, or expired military ID cards.
 
You may want to call the ID card issuing facility before making the trip to the 
base to ensure you have all the supporting documentation for your particular 
situation. Unfortunately, there’s no easy way to reach the right folks on 
base. The best way is to call information (411 in most places) and ask for the 
number for the base operator for that particular military installation. Ask the 
base operator for the phone number for the base’s ID card issuing facility.
 
When you receive your military or dependent ID card, you’ll be simultane-
ously enrolled in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). 
DEERS includes more than 23 million records pertaining to active-duty and 
reserve military and their family members, military retired, Department of 
Defense (DOD) civil service personnel, and DOD contractors. DEERS is com-
prised of the National Enrollment Database (NED), the Person Data Repository 
(PDR), and several satellite databases. After you’re enrolled in DEERS, you’ll 
no longer have to provide proof of eligibility to obtain a military or dependent 
ID card, or replacement in the future.
Signing on the dotted line
Military regulations require the sponsor (the military member or veteran) to 
sign the application for her own or a dependent’s ID card before the card can 
be issued. The sponsor can visit the ID card issuing facility, apply for his or 
the dependent’s ID card, and sign the application.
If you’re applying for a dependent’s card, you can mail the application to the 
dependent, who can then visit a military base for the card to be issued. In 
fact, this is done all the time for new recruits in basic training who have 
dependents.

264
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
Procedures are in place that allow the services to issue dependent ID cards 
in cases where the spouse is unable or unwilling to sign the application, but 
this process usually takes more time. Contact the ID card issuing facility on 
any military base for assistance.
 
If the folks at the ID card issuing facility tell you that they can’t issue a card 
without your sponsor’s signature, refer them to the Uniformed Services 
Identification Card regulation, page 92, paragraph 8-2.
 
Even though military regulations require the sponsor to sign the ID card 
application for dependents, the sponsor can’t deny ID cards or authorized 
privileges to his dependents. It’s Congress who gets to decide who is and is 
not entitled to benefits, not the individual military member or veteran.
What if you can’t travel?
Sometimes entitled individuals can’t travel to a nearby military installation to 
apply for their ID cards in person. These include
 
✓ People who live far from a military facility
 
✓ Those who are physically handicapped
 
✓ Individuals with no means of transportation
 
✓ People who are hospitalized or sick
In such cases, you can call the nearest ID card issuing facility (see the pre-
ceding section) to obtain its mailing address. You’ll need to provide proof 
of entitlement, an 8-x-10-inch or 5-x-7-inch portrait-type photograph that is 
notarized on the back, along with a listing of your physical characteristics 
(your eye and hair color, weight, and height, for example).
This can take a while because it requires several exchanges via certified mail. 
Additionally, the ID card issuing facility may require verification of your 
inability to travel.
 
Because the by-mail procedure is relatively rare, the personnel at the ID 
card issuing facility may be unfamiliar with the process. In some cases, they 
may even tell you it can’t be done. If this happens, refer them to the Uniformed 
Services Identification Card regulation, page 107, table 11.4. It’s amazing 
how attitudes can change when officials discover that you know what’s in the 
regulations!

I
 love to travel. I served 23 years in the Air Force and have traveled around 
the world — twice. In my second life as a retired military member and 
author, I continue to travel every chance I get. If I won the lottery tomorrow, 
I’d sell my condo and move onto a cruise ship.
Even though those winning numbers continue to elude me, I’ve been able to 
feed the travel monkey who lives on my back without breaking the bank. 
How? I’ve taken advantage of travel benefits offered to military members, 
retired military folks (like me), a few other lucky veterans, and their family 
members.
A select category of veterans and their dependents can travel for free on 
military aircraft, stay cheap in lodging facilities located on military bases, 
vacation at a military-operated recreation center, and even rent a luxury 
vacation condominium at an unbelievably low price. In this chapter, I tell 
you about your travel options and what you need to do to take advantage 
of them.

Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
Leaving on a Jet Plane: Military Space 
Available (Space-A) Travel
As much as I love to travel, I hate flying. I know what you’re thinking: “You 
spent 23 years in the Air Force, and you hate to fly?” Let me clarify: I hate 
the cost of flying, especially now that many major airlines are charging for 
checked baggage! “Fly with us, but leave your clothes at home?” I don’t think 
so. Next thing you know, commercial airlines will start doing away with other 
“luxuries,” such as maintenance, pilot training, and radar.
Fortunately, select veterans who have a flexible travel schedule and spare 
time can travel around the world on military aircraft for free when room 
is available to accommodate them. If I wanted to, I could possibly be on a 
flight to Europe tomorrow. Hmm . . . I wonder if my editor would give me an 
extension on my deadline? I could say it’s research. . . .
Space available travel, or space A, as it’s commonly referred to, is just that: 
space available. Passengers who have signed up for travel through this 
program board only after all duty cargo and required passengers have been 
accommodated. Military members traveling on official orders and cargo 
needed to perform military missions come first, and then — if there’s any 
room left on the aircraft — others can fill that space.
The military services operate thousands of flights per week from military air 
terminals and commercial airports throughout the world. Your free flight 
may be on anything from a prop-driven C-130 cargo aircraft, sitting on “web 
seats” surrounded by cargo, to a modern commercial aircraft, such as a 
DC-9, 707, 747, or 767, complete with flight attendant, meals, and movie (the 
military often charters commercial aircraft to haul military members from 
assignment to assignment).
Of course, you can’t just walk into a military airport and say, “Put me on the 
next flight to the Bahamas.” You’ve got to jump through a few hoops first. But 
don’t worry. I’ve traveled space A several times, and I’m glad to walk you 
through the process.
 
Although space-A travel is free, you must pay a head tax if you depart or arrive 
on a military contract flight at a commercial airport. The tax is $12.40 for 
departure, plus an $11.00 immigration/customs inspection fee for arrival. 
There are no fees for departure or arrival on military aircraft at military base 
air terminals.

267
 Chapter 16: Things to Do, Places to See: Travel Benefits
Checking in: Are you eligible 
to fly the friendly skies?
The military allows all sorts of folks to fly space A on its aircraft. In fact, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) regulation for the space-A program includes 
several pages of eligibility categories, including certain veterans, DOD con-
tractors and employees, Red Cross personnel, public health service, and even 
non-U.S. military personnel who are performing duty on U.S. military bases.
For brevity’s sake and because this is a book about benefits available to 
veterans and their dependents, I list only those categories here. If you’re 
interested in the complete list, you can read the DOD regulation that 
governs the program (all 113 pages of it) online at www.dtic.mil/whs/
directives/corres/pdf/451513r.pdf.
Military members, veterans, and family members who are authorized to fill 
empty seats on military aircraft are
 
✓ Active-duty members who are on official leave (vacation). This 
includes members of the reserves and National Guard who are on 
active-duty status.
 
✓ Reserve members not on active duty. Members of the National Guard 
and Reserves who aren’t on active-duty orders may fly space A on flights 
within the continental United States (CONUS) and between the CONUS, 
Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American 
Samoa; or travel within Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin 
Islands.
 
✓ Retired military members. This includes active-duty members with 
20 or more years of military service, and National Guard and Reserve 
members who have more than 20 years of service and are receiving 
retired pay, which usually begins when they turn 60. It also includes 
those who retired from the military early for medical reasons. (Chapter 7 
explains retirement programs.)
 
✓ Gray-area Reserve and National Guard members. These are retired 
members of the Reserves and Guard who have not yet begun receiving 
retired pay (which usually happens at age 60 — see Chapter 7 for more 
information). If you fall into this category, you can only fly space A on 
flights within the CONUS and between the CONUS and Alaska, Hawaii, 
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa; or 
travel within Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
✓ Veterans who have been awarded the Medal of Honor.
 
✓ Dependents of anyone listed here. Unless otherwise indicated in the 
“Take a number: Priority travel categories” section, dependents must 
travel with the military member in order to jump onto a space-A seat.

268
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
Leave, pass, and temporary duty
Military members who leave their place of duty, 
without authorization, are considered absent 
without leave (AWOL). That’s a bad thing. 
However, that doesn’t mean soldiers and 
sailors can’t ever leave their duty assignment; 
they just have to have permission. Military 
members can travel away from their duty area 
when they are on leave (vacation), pass (time 
off), and when authorized to perform temporary 
duty (TDY).
 ✓ Leave: Leave is simply the military’s word 
for vacation. Active-duty members earn 30 
days of leave per year, at the rate of 2.5 
days for each month of active-duty service. 
For space-A purposes, there are three 
types of leave: ordinary leave, emergency 
leave, and environmental morale leave 
(EML).
 
 Military supervisors can allow their subor-
dinates to take ordinary leave any time the 
military mission and unit workload allows. 
Members on ordinary leave travel space A 
in Category III.
 
 Emergency leave is granted when there is a 
death, serious injury, or life-threatening 
illness in the military member’s (or her 
spouse’s) immediate family. Immediate 
family includes parents (including step-
parents), brothers, sisters, sons, and daugh-
ters. It does not include aunts, uncles, 
or cousins. It also does not include grand-
parents unless the grandparent raised the 
member (or spouse) for at least five years in 
loco parentis (in place of a parent). The 
conditions requiring the emergency leave 
must be verified by the American Red Cross. 
Like ordinary leave, emergency leave is 
charged against the member’s leave 
balance. Emergency leave is almost always 
granted, even if the member’s absence will 
impact the unit mission accomplishment. 
Emergency leave is the highest space-A 
travel category.
 
 Environmental morale leave (EML) is 
granted to members assigned to overseas 
installations where the Department of 
Defense has determined that adverse 
environmental conditions require special 
arrangements for leave in more desirable 
places at periodic intervals. Usually, such 
members receive one EML per year. 
Members on EML are placed in Category II 
for space-A travel. The EML program is one 
of the few exceptions when dependents 
can travel space A without the sponsor.
 ✓ Pass: Pass is time off in the military. When 
a military member gets off work, she is on 
pass until her next duty period. Commanders 
can grant three- and even four-day passes 
to members for outstanding achievement, 
and military members who aren’t required 
to work on weekends and holidays are 
on pass during those times. Pass is not 
charged against a member’s leave balance. 
Active-duty members on pass may not 
travel space A.
 ✓ Temporary duty: Temporary duty (TDY) 
occurs when military members are autho-
rized to perform duties away from their 
home station. There are two types of TDY: 
official TDY and permissive TDY. Official 
TDY is when a member’s travel is funded 
by the military, such as when attending a 
military school or training exercise. Those 
performing official TDY don’t travel space 
A because their travel is funded by the 
military. They travel space required.
 
 Permissive TDY isn’t funded by the military, 
but — because the travel is considered 
advantageous to the military — it’s not 
charged against a member’s leave balance. 
One example of permissive TDY is house 
hunting. Members who are getting ready to 
move from one permanent duty station to 
another are authorized ten days of permis-
sive TDY to visit their new duty station for 

269
 Chapter 16: Things to Do, Places to See: Travel Benefits
Choosing a destination
You can choose not one, not two, but as many as five destinations when 
you sign up for space-A travel (see the later section “Finding a military air 
terminal and signing up for travel”). If you’re really up for an impromptu 
adventure, you can choose All as one of your destination choices. That 
means you would go on the waiting list for all the flights departing that 
particular military air terminal.
 
Instead of listing a specific destination, you can also list countries as your 
destination choices. For example, if you listed Misawa Air Base in Japan as 
your destination choice, you would only be considered for flights to that 
particular military air terminal. But if you listed Japan as your destination 
choice, you would be placed on the space-A waiting list for all flights going 
to Japan. See the later section “Establishing a rigid policy of flexibility” for 
more on this idea.
Waiting on the waiting list
Active-duty members remain on the space-A register for the duration of their 
leave orders or until they reach their destination, whichever occurs first. 
Others, such as authorized veterans, remain on the space-A list for 60 days or 
until they complete travel to their listed destination, whichever comes first. If 
your name reaches the top of the waiting list a few days before you arrive at 
the terminal, you don’t lose your place in line. The 60 days/completed travel 
conditions still apply.
 
Getting on the waiting list is a huge timesaver for non-active-duty folks. You 
can, for example, use the remote sign-up program (see the “Finding a military 
air terminal and signing up for travel” section) and get on the waiting list two 
or three weeks before you want to travel. Then when you arrive at the military 
air terminal, your name will be much closer to the top of the list.
the purposes of arranging living accommo-
dations. Other examples of permissive TDY 
are travel to attend a professional confer-
ence or convention and travel to their 
hometown to participate in the military’s 
recruiter assistance program. Under this 
program, military members get to return to 
their hometown without using any of their 
earned leave in exchange for assisting local 
recruiters in locating potential candidates 
for military service. Individuals traveling 
space A for permissive TDY house hunting 
are placed in Category III. Other permissive 
TDY travelers are assigned to Category IV.

There’s probably a military flight terminal near you. However, not all 
terminals have flights to all locations. You can call the terminals for flight 
schedules, availability of remote sign-up (mentioned later in this section), 
directions, or to check your status on the waiting list.
 
As a general rule, terminals located on the West Coast service the Pacific, such 
as Alaska, Hawaii, Korea, Japan, Australia, Guam, the Philippines, and so on. 
Terminals on the East Coast have more flights to Europe and the Middle East. 
All terminals offer flights to various locations in the continental United States.
The major air terminals are much like commercial airports. Facilities may 
include convenience stores, barber shops, snack bars, pay television (free 
television lounge in some military terminals), traveler assistance, baggage 
lockers or rooms, United Services Organization (USO) lounges, and nurseries. 
At smaller bases with limited air operations, the air terminal may be the size 
of a dentist’s waiting room.
You can sign up for a space-A flight by using one of three methods:
 
✓ In-person sign-up: Many people sign up for space-A travel in person at 
the terminal they’re departing from. This is generally not the best 
option, because it usually means standing in line. However, if you have 
questions about flights, your travel documents, or your eligibility to fly 
space A, a friendly passenger service representative will be waiting at 
the front of the line to help you.
 
✓ Self sign-up: Self sign-up allows you to sign up at a terminal without 
waiting in line. Most locations now provide self-sign-up counters with 
easy-to-follow instructions for registration. If your travel will take 
you to a foreign country, you’ll want to ensure your border clearance 
documentation is up-to-date. If you’re unsure, verify it with a passenger 
service representative on duty.
 
 If you’re on active duty, you can’t sign up until the effective date of your 
leave or pass.
 
✓ Remote sign-up: This is a relatively new program, and I love it. Remote 
sign-up allows you to put your name on the space-A waiting list by faxing 
copies of proper service documentation (such as your ID card), along 
with your desired destination(s) and family members’ first names to the 
aerial port of departure. Some terminals now even accept e-mail sign-up. 
You can call the terminal to find out if it offers remote sign-up.

The fax data header (or e-mail) will establish the date and time of your 
sign-up; therefore, active-duty personnel must ensure the fax (or e-mail) 
is sent no earlier than the effective date of leave.
 
 If applicable, you must include a statement that all required border 
clearance documents are current when using the remote sign-up 
program.
Take a number: Priority travel categories
When you sign up for space-A travel, you’re assigned to one of six priority 
travel categories, depending on your status. By “status,” I don’t mean military 
rank; I mean a combination of factors that determine your place on the 
waiting list. Such factors include whether you are active duty, reserves, or 
retired; whether you are traveling for a family emergency; and other factors. 
One of the great things about space-A travel is that rank doesn’t matter here. 
A four-star general receives the same treatment as a one-stripe private.
Category I: Emergency leave
Travelers are placed in Category I when they are traveling on emergency 
leave due to the death or serious illness or injury of a family member 
(see the “Leave, pass, and temporary duty” sidebar).
 
✓ Military members may travel space A under this category from CONUS 
(continental United States) to CONUS, CONUS to overseas, overseas 
to overseas, or overseas to CONUS. Dependents may travel when accom-
panied by the sponsor.
 
✓ Dependents of military members who are stationed in the CONUS may 
travel space A unaccompanied under this category from CONUS to 
overseas or overseas to CONUS.
 
✓ Dependents of military members residing overseas with the sponsor 
may travel unaccompanied, one-way only, to the emergency destination. 
Return travel isn’t authorized under space A.
 
✓ When retired uniformed services members die overseas, their depen-
dents may travel unaccompanied under Category I. Travel is authorized 
for the purpose of accompanying the remains of the deceased from 
overseas to the CONUS. Return travel is authorized if accomplished 
within one year of arrival in the CONUS.
Category II: Environmental morale leave
Military members and their accompanying dependents who are traveling on 
approved EML (environmental morale leave) orders (see the “Leave, pass, 
and temporary duty” sidebar) may travel in Category II from CONUS to 
CONUS, CONUS to overseas, overseas to overseas, and overseas to CONUS.

274
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
Category III: Ordinary leave, house hunting permissive 
TDY, Medal of Honor holders, and others
Category III travelers include:
 
✓ Uniformed services members on a leave status other than emergency 
leave or EML, and their accompanying dependents. This includes 
members of the Reserves and National Guard on active duty. Travel is 
authorized from CONUS to CONUS, CONUS to overseas, overseas to 
overseas, and overseas to CONUS.
 
✓ Dependent spouses of military personnel who have officially been 
reported missing, and accompanying dependent children and parents, 
when traveling for humanitarian reasons and on approval on a case-by-
case basis by the head of the service concerned. Travel is authorized 
from CONUS to CONUS, CONUS to overseas, overseas to overseas, and 
overseas to CONUS.
 
✓ Uniformed services members and one accompanying dependent travel-
ing under permissive temporary duty orders for house hunting in antici-
pation of a pending assignment change. Travel can be from CONUS to 
CONUS, CONUS to overseas, overseas to overseas, and overseas to 
CONUS.
 
✓ Medal of Honor recipients and their accompanying dependents may 
travel in Category III from CONUS to CONUS, CONUS to overseas, over-
seas to overseas, and overseas to CONUS.
Category IV: Unaccompanied dependents on EML
Unaccompanied dependents traveling on the EML program (environmental 
morale leave; see the “Leave, pass, and temporary duty” sidebar) travel 
space A under the fourth priority travel category. Travel is authorized 
from overseas to CONUS, overseas to overseas, and CONUS to overseas. 
Dependents traveling unaccompanied for EML aren’t authorized to travel 
space A from CONUS to CONUS.
Category V: Permissive TDY (non-house hunting) and students
Military members traveling on permissive TDY (temporary duty) and certain 
dependent children may travel space A under this category:
 
✓ Military personnel traveling on permissive TDY orders other than 
for house hunting may travel CONUS to CONUS, CONUS to overseas, 
overseas to overseas, and overseas to CONUS. Dependents aren’t autho-
rized to accompany sponsors during non-house-hunting permissive TDY 
space-A travel.
 
✓ Dependent children who are college students attending an overseas 
branch of an American university located in the same overseas area in 
which they reside with the sponsor can travel unaccompanied to and 
from their school under this category. Only one round trip each year is 
authorized.

275
 Chapter 16: Things to Do, Places to See: Travel Benefits
 
✓ Unaccompanied spouses of military members stationed in overseas 
areas may travel space A, in response to written requests from school 
officials or when deemed essential by the sponsor’s commander to 
address the needs of family members attending school at an overseas 
location. In this situation, the spouse doesn’t need to be accompanied 
by the sponsor.
Category VI: Retired military, National Guard, and Reserves
This is the category I travel under when I decide to do it the space-A way:
 
✓ Retired military members and their accompanying dependents may 
travel from CONUS to CONUS, CONUS to overseas, overseas to overseas, 
and overseas to CONUS. This includes retired members of the National 
Guard and Reserves who are receiving retired pay (usually at age 60; 
Chapter 7 explains the military retirement program).
 
✓ Reserve and National Guard members who are not on active duty, and 
retired members of the Guard and Reserves who are not yet entitled to 
retired pay may travel space A in the CONUS; directly between the 
CONUS and Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, 
and American Samoa; and within Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. 
Virgin Islands.
Calling all flights! Securing 
available seats
After you’ve signed up for space-A destinations and are assigned to a travel 
category, you compete against others on the waiting list for available seats. 
Category I passengers are assigned seats before Category II passengers, 
who get seats before Category III travelers, and so on.
Within a category, it’s first come, first served. If you and I were both in 
Category VI, and you signed up before me, you would be ahead of me on the 
waiting list.
Space-A seats are normally identified as early as two to three hours and as 
late as 30 minutes prior to departure. You can call the passenger service 
center to find out the space-available showtime for each scheduled flight that 
meets your travel requirements. See “Finding a military air terminal and 
signing up for travel” for information about contacting the passenger service 
centers.
If your name is called and you’re not there, you don’t lose your place on the 
waiting list. This is a great feature of space-A travel because your name 
remains on the list until you reach your destination or for 60 days, whichever 
comes first. So you can sign up for space A weeks in advance and keep 
moving up on the waiting list before you even arrive at the terminal.

276
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
 
Active-duty members must be on official leave orders before they can sign up 
for space A.
 
Each terminal maintains a space-A register (organized alphabetically, by prior-
ity and the date and time of registration for travel) that is updated daily. The 
register is conveniently located in the terminal and is directly accessible to 
you. You can even call the terminal to find where you stand travel-wise. See 
“Finding a military air terminal and signing up for travel” for phone numbers.
The good news is that once you’re assigned a space-A seat, you can’t be 
bumped out of that seat by another space-A passenger, even if he’s in a 
higher category.
The bad news is that you can be bumped at any point during your journey 
by space-required passengers — that is, those military members traveling 
on official orders. If you’re removed en route, you may reregister using your 
original date and time of registration.
 
If you’re removed en route and decide to change your destination, you don’t 
get to keep your original date and time of registration. Passenger agents 
will assign a new date and time when you change or add a country to your 
itinerary.
Getting back home again
At some point after you’ve reached your travel destination, you’ll probably 
want to return home. Or maybe you won’t. I can think of several places I’ve 
visited that I haven’t wanted to leave. In any event, if you’re planning to 
return home at some point, it’s a good idea to sign up for a return flight 
immediately after you reach your destination. Again, your name remains on 
the waiting list for up to 60 days. So while you’re out seeing the sights of 
Europe or Japan, your name will be getting closer and closer to the top of the 
list for your return flight.
 
When traveling on a passport (family members, retired military, reserves, 
and so on), you may return to the continental United States only through 
authorized ports of entry where customs and immigration clearance is 
available. Although you may depart the United States from any military air-
field, reentry locations for passport holders are limited. Active-duty passen-
gers who don’t require immigration clearance have more reentry options.
Packing right by packing light
The military lets you take quite a lot on space-A flights. Each passenger may 
check two pieces of baggage, which can be 70 pounds each, up to 62 linear 
inches (length + width + height) in size. Family members may even pool their 

277
 Chapter 16: Things to Do, Places to See: Travel Benefits
baggage allowances. You are also allowed to hand-carry one article (small 
baggage, backpack, or such) and one personal item (purse, briefcase, teddy 
bear) for storage in the passenger cabin area. Hand-carried items can be no 
larger than 45 linear inches and must fit under your seat or in the overhead 
compartment (if available).
Although the military allows you to take everything but the kitchen sink, it’s 
not a good idea. Space-A travel isn’t exactly like commercial travel. There 
isn’t going to be any curbside check-in or porters. You can’t even check your 
bags until you’ve been called for a seat. That means you’re going to have 
your bags with you in the terminal while waiting for your name to be called.
If you have to go to the bathroom, someone is going to have to watch your 
luggage, or you’re going to have to haul everything to the bathroom with 
you. If your name isn’t called that day, you’ll have to cart your stuff out of the 
terminal to your overnight accommodations. The lighter you pack, the less 
you’ll have to haul around.
 
While packing light is a good idea, if you’re traveling with young children, you 
may encounter delays in places where baby supplies may not be readily 
available, so make sure you have all the little ones’ necessities on hand. It’s 
also a good idea to bring a supply of games and books to keep the kiddies 
from getting too bored. “Are we there yet?”
Establishing a rigid policy of flexibility
Space-A travel success depends on flexibility and good timing. Although 
some travelers sign up and travel the same day, aircraft seats are space 
available, and you may have to wait several days for your name to be called 
for a seat on your flight of choice. You should make sure your finances 
permit for an overnight stay, because most military air terminals close at 
night. If you have to stay overnight, consider staying on-base in the military 
lodging facility. This can save you big bucks. Plus you’ll be closer to the air 
terminal. See the “Sleeping Cheaply at Military Lodging” section for more 
information.
Be as flexible as possible in choosing a destination. For example, if you want 
to get to Ramstein Air Base, Germany, consider a flight to Spangdahlem 
Air Base, Germany, or even Royal Air Force (RAF) Base Mildenhall, United 
Kingdom, as an alternative. At Mildenhall, you can try for another flight 
bound for Germany. For more great tips on making your space-A adventure 
easier and less frustrating, see Chapter 19.

278
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
Sleeping Cheaply at Military Lodging
Bunking down at military lodging is another travel benefit I use all the time. 
I find it especially useful when driving cross-country or for short stays in 
locations that have military bases close by. Why pay $75 or more per night to 
stay in a small motel when you can get the military equivalent for about $35 
per night?
All military bases operate temporary lodging facilities. Think of them as 
motels. The primary purpose of these operations is to provide a temporary 
place to stay for military folks on official business, such as visiting the base 
on official temporary duty or transitioning in or out of the base on official 
permanent change of station moves.
But after these individuals are accommodated, certain veterans and their 
family members can stay in these facilities, too. Like space-A air travel 
(see the “Leaving on a Jet Plane: Military Space Available (Space-A) Travel” 
section in this chapter), getting a room here is space available. That means 
folks traveling on official military business get first crack at available rooms.
Checking in on your eligibility
The key to getting a room, space available, at a military lodging facility lies 
with that all-magic document, the military ID card (see Chapter 15 for more 
on who qualifies for this handy piece of plastic and how to get one). Those 
eligible for this benefit include active-duty military members, members 
of the National Guard and Reserves, Medal of Honor holders, 100 percent 
disabled veterans, military retirees receiving retired pay, and dependents of 
these folks.
 
Although you must meet the eligibility criteria to make reservations and check 
in, guests of those eligible may stay at military lodging facilities provided the 
eligible patron is present at check-in.
Facility types and their rates
There are more types of lodging facilities scattered throughout U.S. military 
bases than you can shake a stick at. Every base is different. You may find 
yourself staying at a very modern, modular-construction, complete house-
keeping unit that sleeps a family of five, or a modern low-rise or high-rise 
hotel. On the other hand, the base may feature reconstructed World War II 
barracks, which have been converted into single rooms with a bathroom 
shared between two rooms.

279
 Chapter 16: Things to Do, Places to See: Travel Benefits
One time when traveling across Europe, I was placed space A for two nights 
in the VIP quarters at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The room featured a 
separate bedroom, sitting room, and kitchen/dining room. It even had a 
minibar! At first I thought they recognized me from my many military books 
and articles, but I later discovered that I just got lucky, and that’s what they 
had space available at the time.
Another time I stayed space available at a very small Army base in Korea and 
received a room about 400 square feet in size with a single steel bed, a small 
desk, and an even smaller dresser. The latrine (the Army word for bathroom) 
was down the hall and was shared by everyone on that floor.
Rates vary widely from place to place and usually reflect the type of accom-
modation. One thing is certain: Rates are always substantially cheaper than 
comparable accommodations off-base. For the privilege of being treated like 
a king during my stay at Ramstein, I paid $65 per night. My time in that prison 
cell in Korea only set me back $6 per night.
Not long ago, when traveling with my family in California, I stayed in the 
Temporary Lodging Facility (TLF) at Edwards Air Force Base. TLFs are 
intended for military families transitioning in to a new base or preparing to 
leave a base for their next assignment. My space-available TLF stay included 
two bedrooms, a living room, large bathroom, private laundry room, and full 
kitchen. Cost? $65 per night.
Reserving your right to rest
I remember the days when staying space available at military lodging facili-
ties was no picnic. You generally would have to wait until 6 p.m., and then 
check with the lobby, in person, to see if any space-available accommoda-
tions were available for the night. If you wanted to stay for more than one 
night, you ran the risk of getting bumped out of your room each day by a 
space-required military member.
Thankfully, those days are long gone. Because of computerized central 
reservation systems, the military lodging facilities now have a handle on 
availability, even a couple of months in advance.
Active-duty members and their dependents who want space-available 
accommodations may make reservations up to 60 days in advance. Other 
authorized space-available participants may reserve rooms up to 30 days 
ahead of their visit. After your reservation is confirmed, you can’t be 
bumped, even by those staying on official travel orders. How cool is that?

Centralized reservation systems for Army, Navy, and Air Force lodging
Three of the five military services operate centralized reservation systems, a 
single contact point for reservations at any of their lodging facilities:
 
✓ To make reservations on any Army post, call 866-363-5771.
 
✓ Reservations to stay on Navy bases can be made by calling 800-NAVY-
INN (800-628-9466).
 
✓ You can reserve rooms at Air Force lodging facilities at 888-AF-LODGE 
(888-235-6343).
The Marine Corps and Coast Guard have to be different. They don’t have 
centralized reservation systems, probably because they have far fewer bases 
than the other three branches.

Getting Some R&R at 
Armed Forces Resorts
Sometimes a clean bed and a shower just aren’t enough. Sometimes you 
need to splurge a little for some rest and recuperation at a luxury vacation 
resort. An Armed Forces Recreation Center (AFRC) may be just what you’re 
looking for.
AFRC resorts are affordable Joint Service facilities operated by the U.S. Army 
Family, Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command and are located at ideal 
vacation destinations. AFRCs offer a full range of resort hotel opportunities 
for those who hold the magic ID card (see Chapter 14 for more on eligibility 
and obtaining one of these gems). If you’re a military member (either active 
duty or reserve), retiree, veteran with a 100 percent service-connected 
disability, have won the Medal of Honor, or a dependent of one of these fine 
citizens, you’re eligible for this perk.
Although not as cheap as military lodging facilities (see the “Sleeping Cheaply 
at Military Lodging” section earlier in this chapter), AFRC room rates are 
affordable. Rates are based on military rank (or the rank you held when you 
separated from the military), room size, and location. There’s no “space 
available” here. Everyone with an ID card is equally eligible, regardless of 
duty status. However, these places are popular, and I mean popular! Reser-
vations are required, often months in advance.

Cape Henry Inn and Beach Club
Ah, how I love the beach. The Cape Henry Inn and Beach Club is located on 
one of the finest beaches in the world — Fort Story near Virginia Beach, 
Virginia, nestled among protected sand dunes, overlooking Chesapeake Bay.
Facilities include 50 spacious hotel rooms with kitchenette and private 
balcony; multiple cottages, bungalows, and log cabins; handicapped-
equipped rooms; two outdoor pools; and a fitness center. Activities range 
from boardwalk strolls, pristine beaches, hiking, whale watching, museums, 
shopping, and fine dining.
The Cape Henry Inn and Beach Club doesn’t have its own restaurant on the 
property, but several dining choices are nearby. It does, however, have a 
large banquet facility that’s suitable for weddings, group functions, events, 
and parties. Catering is available.
Like all AFRCs, rates are based on season, type of room, and your military 
rank (or the rank you held when you left military service), ranging from $75 
to $175 per night.
Reservations can be made up to 52 weeks in advance. Reservations can be 
made by phone at 757-422-8818 or online at www.capehenryinn.com.
Shades of Green at Disney World
For many children, visiting Walt Disney World may be the Mecca of vacation 
spots. Taking pictures and getting autographs with Disney’s finest is one 
thing they may very well remember for their whole lives. What do the 
parents remember, though? Expensive resorts, high-priced meals, and out-of-
this-world attraction prices.
However, for those eligible to stay at AFRCs, there’s an answer to these 
headaches: the Shades of Green Resort. Nestled between the Palm and 
Magnolia golf courses on Walt Disney World property, the Shades of Green 
boasts 586 guest rooms, 10 family and junior suites, two heated pools and a 
hot tub, state-of-the-art fitness center, and transportation to all of Orlando’s 
many attractions. The resort also has an on-site ticket office, which provides 
discounted tickets to dozens of locations, including all Walt Disney World 
theme parks, Universal Studios, Sea World Orlando, and the Kennedy 
Space Center.
 
Exceptional dining options are available throughout the resort and include 
Mangino’s, the Garden Gallery Restaurant, Evergreens Sports Bar and Grill, 
and the Express Cafe.

Hale Koa in Hawaii
Who doesn’t get excited about the prospect of a Hawaiian vacation? What? 
You say it’s not in the budget? If you take advantage of the Armed Forces 
Recreation Center Hale Koa, located on the famous Waikiki Beach, it just may 
become an affordable option.
The Hale Koa’s two towers, Maile and Ilima, house 817 spacious guest rooms. 
Most rooms are furnished with one king, two queen, or two double beds. 
Activities include beach services that rent surf and snorkel equipment, swim-
ming pools, a fitness center, spa services with massage, tennis courts, sand 
volleyball, outdoor racquetball courts, and world-class golfing opportunities 
near the hotel.
 
You can enjoy culinary delights at Koko’s Cafe, Bibas, or the Hale Koa Room 
restaurants, located on the property. Nightly entertainment features magic, 
songs and dances of Polynesia, and the best luau on Waikiki Beach. Okay, I’ve 
only been to one luau on Waikiki Beach, but it seemed like the best to me.
For a luxury beach resort located directly on the most famous beach in the 
world, rates are extremely reasonable, ranging from $87 to $277 per night, 
depending on your rank, the season, and the type of room. For reservations, 
call 800-367-6027, or you can make online reservations at www.halekoa.com.
Edelweiss in Germany
When I tell people about vacationing in the Bavarian Alps a couple of years 
ago, they often look me over as if trying to find out where I hide all my 
money. But when coupled with a free space-A military aircraft hop (see the 
“Leaving on a Jet Plane: Military Space Available (Space-A) Travel” section) 
and reservations at the AFRC Edelweiss Lodge, it was a sweet deal.
Edelweiss Lodge and Resort offers an array of guest amenities, entertain-
ment, and recreation activities. You can enjoy a sightseeing tour of the area 
or spend a day on some of the best slopes ever. Afterward, perhaps a work-
out in the modern fitness club or a therapeutic massage is in order. For the 
water-inclined, there’s an indoor pool and an outdoor hot tub. For your 
dining pleasure, the Edelweiss boasts four restaurants featuring foods from 
around the world, including regional cuisine and all-American favorites.

284
Part IV: Home Is Where the Heart Is — Except When You’re Traveling! 
Depending on the season, type of room, and your military rank, a night at the 
Edelweiss will set you back about $84 to $239. Rustic cabins are available for 
$399 for seven nights, and deluxe cabins can be had for $1,113 for a week’s 
stay. Reservations can be made by calling 011-49-8821-9440 or by visiting 
www.edelweisslodgeandresort.com.
Dragon Hill in South Korea
I spent seven years of my military career stationed in Korea. When I wanted 
to escape the pressures and stress of my duties, my first choice was always a 
stay at the Dragon Hill Lodge, located in the heart of Seoul.
Seoul, Korea, offers some of the best shopping opportunities in the world, 
and when you’re finished getting world-class deals, the lodge provides you 
with a respite where you can enjoy a state-of-the-art health club and pool, 
travel and tour services, a gift store, flower shop, and beauty salon. Dining 
facilities include four full-service restaurants and a deli. There’s even a 
Subway and a Pizza Hut for that fast-food taste of home.
Each of the 394 guest rooms and suites features a queen-size bed and a 
sleeper sofa, private bath, color television with satellite channels, direct-dial 
telephone, ironing board, mini refrigerator, coffee maker, and fireproof safe. 
Each room has high-speed Internet access.
Rates run from $59 to $139 per night, depending on your rank and the type of 
room you select. You can reserve a room at the Dragon Hill Lodge by calling 
011-82-2-7918-222 or going to their Web site at www.dragonhilllodge.com.
Going Condo-Crazy with the Armed 
Forces Vacation Club
Sometimes I need a luxury vacation, but I don’t want to travel to one of the 
five Armed Forces Recreation Centers, and I don’t want to max out my credit 
cards. What do I do then? I take advantage of a little-known veteran travel 
benefit called the Armed Forces Vacation Club (AFVC).
As with staying at military lodging facilities (see the “Sleeping Cheaply at

These lucky veterans and family members can rent luxury condos at more 
than 3,500 locations around the world for the low cost of $329 per week. That 
comes out to $47 per day!
If you’ve got the time, 
they’ve got the place
Thousands of timeshare condos are located throughout the world. Often, 
someone buys a timeshare and then doesn’t have an opportunity to use it. 
These unused timeshare weeks are sometimes rented out by the condo’s 
management association, instead of allowing them to sit empty. The Depart-
ment of Defense’s Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Service has made a special 
deal with many of these management associations to offer unused timeshares 
to military members and eligible veterans and family members for the unbe-
lievable price of $329 per week.
The AFVC has listings for virtually everywhere, including all states, Europe, 
Australia, the Bahamas, Africa, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, 
India, the Pacific . . . pretty much anywhere you want to go.
Claiming your condo
Using the AFVC to locate and reserve a luxury condo for your next leave 
or vacation is simplicity itself. If you’ve never used the AFVC before, you 
must first call the club at 800-724-9988. The hours of operation are Monday 
through Friday 0700 to 2400 hours (7 a.m. to midnight), Saturday 0900 to 2000 
hours (9 a.m. to 8 p.m.), and Sunday 0930 to 2000 hours (9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; 
all times are eastern time).
When you call the first time, the kind folks at the reservation center will issue 
you an account number and password. Write this down and keep it some-
where safe. You can then use this information to log onto the AFVC Web site 
at www.afvclub.com and make your reservations online.
If you prefer not to use the Internet to make reservations, you can use the 
Web site to locate available condo rentals, and then reserve the condo by 
calling 800-724-9988.
Condos may become available to AFVC members anywhere from 2 to 365 
days in advance of the check-in date. As soon as they become available, 
they’re listed on the Web site and can be reserved. After a reservation is 
made, the unit is taken out of the available reservation pool and the unit is 
yours. The reservation is guaranteed. Reservations are made on a first-come, 
first-served basis, so a high-demand location may be available in the morning 
but gone by that afternoon.

Some resorts in Mexico or the Caribbean are all-inclusive resorts. This means 
the resort provides all meals, beverages, entertainment, and sometimes 
day-trips, just like on a cruise ship. Anyone who stays at an all-inclusive resort 
pays a per-person fee for this service (in addition to the $329 per week rental 
fee). At some resorts, this is optional. At others, it’s a mandatory fee. Even 
condo owners at these resorts must pay the fee when they stay in their own 
property. This fee can be very high, sometimes up to $1,000 for the week. 
All-inclusive conditions and rates are set by the resort, and the AFVC has 
no control over them. These resorts are well marked on the Web site, and 
vacation counselors will point out these fees if you make a reservation over 
the phone.

▶ Seeking education and employment help
▶ Visiting with a veterans service organization
G
etting help with veterans benefits isn’t all that difficult, and it’s a 
wonder more veterans don’t do so. Remember when you were in the 
military and were taught how team effort is the key to mission accomplish-
ment? Well, the same is true when the “mission” involves applying for and 
receiving the veterans benefits you’ve earned and deserve.
Going it alone is not the best option. Two heads are better than one, and all 
that. You can get help from all sorts of places, and I list the top ten here.
American Legion
The American Legion was chartered by Congress in 1919 as a patriotic, wartime 
veterans organization devoted to mutual helpfulness. The organization has 
about 3 million members and nearly 15,000 American Legion Posts throughout 
the world. Many of these posts have accredited American Legion representatives 
to help veterans with their VA claims and appeals. These services are free, and 
you don’t have to join the organization to receive these services.

Defense Finance & Accounting Center
The folks at the Defense Finance & Accounting Center are the ones to 
contact if you need help with your military retired pay (see Chapter 7) or 
Combat Related Special Compensation (see Chapter 6). When you were in 
the military, you got help with your pay through the finance section on the 
military base you were assigned to, but that’s not possible after you leave 
military service. Your pay matters are now handled by the Defense Finance 
& Accounting Center, located in Cleveland, Ohio. They maintain all pay 
accounts for military retirees.

of detailed information about military retiree pay issues. It even supports 
an online system called MyPay, where you can make changes to your pay 
account, such as updates to your address, phone number, and tax information.
Disabled American Veterans
The Disabled American Veterans (DAV) is an organization of disabled veter-
ans who are focused on building better lives for disabled veterans and their 
families. The DAV is a veterans service organization (VSO) that is chartered 
by Congress and is authorized by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to 
represent and assist veterans with benefit claims and appeals. Like all VSOs, 
the DAV is a private organization funded by member dues and contributions; 
it’s not an agency of the government.

291
 Chapter 17: Ten Places to Get Help with Veterans Benefits
The DAV staffs 88 offices with a corps of 260 volunteers who are certified and 
authorized to directly represent veterans with claims for benefits from the 
VA and Department of Defense. This free service is available to all veterans.

National Veterans Legal 
Services Program
The National Veterans Legal Services Program (NVLSP) is an independent, 
nonprofit, charitable organization that recruits, trains, and assists thousands 
of volunteer lawyers and veterans advocates to help veterans with their VA 
claims and appeals. The organization also represents veterans and their 
dependents who are seeking benefits from the VA and in court.
The NVLSP manages the Veterans Consortium Pro Bono Program (explained 
in Chapter 3), a great program that can provide pro bono (free) attorneys 
to veterans who are appealing their case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
Veterans Claims.

enhance and maintain the quality of life for noncommissioned and petty offi-
cers in all branches of the armed forces, National Guard, and Reserves. The 

292

NCOA is well known among veterans and military members for employment 
programs. Through its Veterans Employment Assistance program, established 
in 1973, the NCOA has helped more than 60,000 veterans find employment.
Presently, the NCOA has two programs that assist veterans who are seeking 
employment throughout the world. These programs are the National Job Fair 
and the Internet job board located at www.MilitaryJobWorld.com or www.
TheJobLeader.com. No membership requirements or fees are charged to 
veterans for the job assistance services.

State Veterans Offices
Every state and several U.S. territories have their own veterans affairs office, 
division, or bureau that is funded and managed by the individual state gov-
ernment. Although these offices are primarily responsible for processing 
veterans benefits for their residents, many of them have skilled counselors 
who can help veterans obtain federal veterans benefits as well. Often, state 
veterans offices can also assist in preparing for or obtaining employment in 
the state.
It’s most certainly worth your time to find out more about your state’s office. 
You can find a listing of state veterans offices, as well as contact and Web 
information, in Appendix A.
VA Regional Centers and Vet Centers
The VA isn’t there just to process your paperwork. VA regional centers and 
vet centers have highly trained counselors who can help you put together a 
winning veterans benefit claims submission.
Under a law known as the “VA’s duty to assist,” explained further in Chapter 3, 
the VA is required to assist you by telling you exactly what supporting evi-
dence you need to support your claim for benefits, as well as by doing every-
thing in its power to help locate that evidence for you. The smart veteran will 
take advantage of this law by contacting his nearest VA regional center or

293

vet center to sit down with a counselor before submitting his claim. You can 
find your nearest VA regional center or vet center in Appendix B.
Veterans Representatives 
on College Campuses
Most colleges and universities in the United States have a veterans affairs 
office. The folks in these offices are very helpful when you want to apply for 
veterans education benefits, as described in Chapters 10 and 11. Quite often, 
the individuals who work in such offices are veterans themselves, providing 
a “been there, done that” approach to helping veterans achieve their educa-
tional goals.
If you want help getting started with or continuing a college degree or train-
ing program, these are often the best folks to ask. Not only are they knowl-
edgeable about federal benefits, but they have the latest information about 
state veterans education benefits as well. Call your local college or university 
and ask if it has a veterans office.
Veterans of Foreign Wars
The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) was originally founded in 1899 as the 
American Veterans of Foreign Service. With 2.4 million members and more 
than 8,500 VFW posts located around the world, this VSO (veterans service 
organization) strives to be a voice for returning and currently deployed ser-
vice members and their families.
The VFW maintains a nationwide network of service officers, which includes 
full-time professional veteran advocates and trained volunteer advocates, 
each of whom is certified by the VA to represent veterans on matters of 
claims and appeals. They assist more than 120,000 veterans and their families 
each year. These services are free, and you don’t have to join the organiza-
tion to take advantage of them.

Chapter 18
Ten T ips for Avoiding Problems 
with Your VA Benefit Claims
In This Chapter
▶ Instructions about instructions
▶ Communicating with the VA
▶ Dealing with deadlines
W
orking with a government agency — any government agency — can 
be frustrating. It seems at times that government employees must 
attend a special school that teaches methods to make things more compli-
cated. These well-meaning people don’t do this on purpose. I’m sure they 
don’t. It’s just that they’re saddled with a bunch of laws and regulations 
imposed on them by Congress and other high-ranking policy officials. They’re 
required to make sure all the i’s are dotted and all the t’s are crossed. But if 
you follow some simple rules, you’ll find that dealing with the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) is much less frustrating.
Don’t Try to Go It Alone
There are dozens of veterans benefits, and each one has different forms, pro-
cedures, and qualifications. This book helps you understand many of them, 
but it’s still a good idea to get expert advice and help when preparing a claim 
for benefits.
Numerous people and organizations are able to help you, including veterans 
service organizations (VSOs), counselors at VA regional offices and vet cen-
ters, representatives at various state veteran offices, and even lawyers who 
specialize in veterans affairs. Chapter 17 includes a list of folks who can help 
with veterans benefit claims.

296
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Read the Instructions Carefully
Yes, I know reading instructions isn’t much fun. Half the time when I try to 
put something together, I skip reading the instructions, only to find out that I 
did it the hard way. Had I read the instructions in the first place, I would have 
saved hours. VA forms are much the same way. Taking a few extra minutes to 
read the instructions can save you loads of time. Sometimes a particular VA 
form is used to file for more than one benefit. The instructions will tell you 
which part(s) of the form to complete for which benefit(s).
For example, the same form is used to apply for both disability compensation 
and a VA pension (see Chapter 6), but the form has separate areas to fill out 
for each. Because the law says you can’t receive both disability compensa-
tion and a VA pension at the same time, you only need to complete the sec-
tion of the form that applies to the benefit you want. The instructions also 
usually include information about where to file the claim. Sending your claim 
to the wrong place can add months to the processing time.
Answer All the Questions
This may seem obvious, but many people leave a question field blank if they 
think it doesn’t apply to them or they don’t know the information. That’s a mis-
take when dealing with the VA. When the VA employees review the claim, they 
don’t know if you left the question blank on purpose or if you simply didn’t see 
it or if you forgot to answer it. That means they’ll probably stop the process 
and send the form back to you with a letter requesting more information. It’s 
much better to write “Unknown” or “None” or “Not Applicable” on the form 
than to leave the area blank.
 
If you have an unusual situation that requires lengthy answers, feel free to 
attach separate sheets of paper. For example, if the form asks for your child’s 
Social Security number and you don’t have one yet because the child was 
recently born, explain that. Don’t just leave the area blank.
Include Only Relevant Information
Make sure any evidence or information you include with your claim is directly 
related to the claim. Remember, it’s the quality, not the quantity, that counts. 
Including information and background that has nothing to do with your claim 
just wastes time. The reviewing officials then have to sort through the irrele-
vant information to find the stuff that directly supports your claim. That’s not 
only a bummer for them, but it can result in a significant delay of processing 
your claim.

297
 Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Avoiding Problems with Your VA Benefit Claims
Use Your Claim Number
When you file a claim for a VA benefit, you’re issued a claim number. 
Everything is computerized these days, and this number is the VA’s refer-
ence to the location where all of your claim information is located. Write your 
claim number on all correspondence and all forms you complete in relation 
to your existing claim. Otherwise, your information may wander around the 
halls of the VA for a time before it finally reaches the right place.
 
Don’t make the rookie mistake of writing your claim number only on the 
envelope. Usually the envelopes are opened and discarded in the mailroom, 
so the number and the envelope’s contents are forever separated.
Keep the VA Informed
The folks who work at the VA aren’t psychic. They have no way of know-
ing if you moved, changed your phone number, had a kid, got married, got 
divorced, or whatever unless you tell them. Because many of these factors 
affect your eligibility for benefits and how much you may receive in benefits, 
you want to let the VA know about these changes as soon as possible so they 
can be included when considering your claim.
 
Don’t assume that one section of the VA talks to another section. For example, 
if you’re receiving healthcare at a VA medical center (see Chapter 4) and also 
have a claim pending for disability compensation with the VA regional office 
(see Chapter 6), don’t assume that if you change your address at the VA 
medical center that the VA regional center will know about it. You need to 
notify both centers.
Meet the Time Limits
If you receive a letter from the VA about your claim and it states you have a 
certain amount of time to respond, you better take the deadline seriously. In 
most cases, these time limits are established by law. If you fail to respond in 
the required time frame, it may result in an automatic denial of your claim, 
and then you have to start the process all over.
Usually, the time frame (which is normally 30 or 60 days) is established from 
the date the VA mailed the request to you to the date your answer is post-
marked. Remember, you don’t have to wait until the last minute to respond. 
The quicker you respond, the less time your claim is delayed.

298
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Read VA Correspondence Carefully
Correspondence from the VA is often loaded with useful information. For 
example, it may include a required time frame during which you must respond 
to keep your claim open, or it may provide you with information about how 
you can get even more goodies from the VA. Don’t make the mistake of reading 
just the first page. Every page is important.
I knew a veteran who applied for and received VA disability compensation. 
He was excited when his claim was approved, but he failed to read beyond 
the first page of the approval letter, which stated how much money he would 
get. Had he read further, he would have known that if he ever got married (he 
was single at the time), he could apply for an increase in benefits. He didn’t 
find out about that until I told him (several months after his marriage).
Establish a Filing System
Every piece of paper you receive from the VA is important. File a copy of 
everything in one place and arrange it chronologically. Make sure your loved 
ones know where the information is filed in case they have to carry on for 
you if you’re sick or hospitalized. If a problem occurs with your claim, this 
correspondence (arranged chronologically) can help you form an appeal.
When you speak with someone on the phone about your claim, keep notes 
and make sure they’re specific (date, time, subject, and the name of the 
person you talked to). Keep these notes in your filing system.
Keep Your Appointments
If you’re scheduled for an appointment for a hearing on your claim or for 
a physical examination in support of your claim, do everything possible to 
be there. If you miss an appointment for a hearing, you may not get another 
chance to explain your side of the issue. If the VA does agree to reschedule 
the hearing, it could delay your claim or appeal by months. If you miss a 
medical examination in support of your claim, it can also take months to 
reschedule the exam.
Claims and appeals already take long enough to grind their way through the 
system. No need to add to this time just because you decide that you’d rather 
take in a movie instead of going to a boring hearing or medical examination.

Ten T ips for Traveling 
via the Military
In This Chapter
▶ Planning your space-available travel
▶ Arriving at the terminal prepared for adventure
▶ Getting home again
M
any veterans and their family members can travel for free on military 
aircraft by using the space-available travel program (often referred 
to as “space A”; I cover this program in more depth in Chapter 16). Although 
this is a valuable benefit, space-A travel can often be frustrating.
Take it from a space-A travel veteran: Maintaining a strong sense of humor 
and a rigid policy of flexibility is the key to a successful space-A experience. 
Here are some tips designed to keep you from pulling out your hair when 
trying to get from here to there when traveling with the military.
Choose Your Departure Terminal 
with Forethought
Generally speaking, military air terminals on the West Coast have more sched-
uled flights to Pacific locations, such as Japan, Hawaii, Alaska, Korea, Australia, 
and Guam, while terminals on the East Coast have the most flights to Europe 
and the Middle East. You need to plan your travel itinerary accordingly.
Also keep in mind that military terminals located in commercial airports 
are mostly contract flights, and the military generally fills those with space-
required passengers. You have a much better chance of “catching a hop” (to 
use the common military phrase) from a terminal located on a military base 
than from a terminal located in a commercial airport.

300
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Time Your Travel Wisely
If possible, travel during off-peak space-A travel periods. Historically, 
February through March and October through November are low travel peri-
ods, and your chances to get out quickly on a space-A hop are much greater. 
(Peak periods are the summer months when school is out and during the 
Christmas holiday season.)
Sign Up from the Comfort of Home
Don’t waste your time standing in line at the terminal to sign up for a space-
A flight. Most terminals now allow remote signup, which allows you to put 
your name on the space-A waiting list via fax, and sometimes even by e-mail. 
(Flip to Chapter 16 for contact information.) The advantage of this system is 
that your name stays on the waiting list for up to 60 days, getting closer and 
closer to the top every day.
 
I recommend signing up for a space-A flight three to four weeks before your 
desired date of travel. That way when you get to the terminal, you should get a 
seat fairly quickly. You can call the terminal at any time to find out where you 
stand on the waiting list.
Plan for Flexibility
When you want to travel around the world, you can often get where you want 
to go by any number and combination of routes and stops. You may feel like 
you’re playing a game of connect the dots, but with a little patience and flex-
ibility, you will reach your destination.
For example, if you want to get to Japan, consider listing Korea as one of your 
destination choices. You can then sign up for a flight to Japan at the military 
air terminal in Korea. Both Osan and Kunsan air bases in Korea generally 
have several flights per week to Japan.
Double-Check Your Travel Documents
Although active-duty military members can travel to most countries by using 
their military ID card and leave (vacation) orders, family members and 

301
 Chapter 19: Ten T ips for Traveling via the Military
veterans usually need a valid passport. Some countries require a visa or may 
require that certain vaccinations be current. Use the State Department’s Web 
site at www.state.gov to check for required travel documents. Nothing 
is more frustrating than arriving at the military flight terminal, having your 
name called for a space-A flight, and then discovering that you can’t board 
because you don’t have the right travel documents.
Pack Lightly
As a space-A traveler, you can check two pieces of luggage, weighing up to 
70 pounds each, per person. Family members traveling together can pool 
their baggage allowance as long as the total doesn’t exceed the total allow-
ance. However, I strongly recommend that you travel lightly. Take only what 
is essential for your trip. Why? Because you can’t check your bags until your 
name is called for your flight. That means you have to haul your bags with 
you everywhere while you wait.
 
Although some terminals have baggage lockers, many don’t. Additionally, 
because this is space-available travel, you may not get a flight on the same day 
you arrive at the terminal, so you and your bags will be stuck waiting over-
night somewhere. Also, don’t place valuables, medicine, or important docu-
ments in your checked baggage. That’s good advice, no matter how you travel.
Arrive Ready to Go
Call the terminal to find out when the space-A showtime is for your flight. 
(Terminal phone numbers are listed in Chapter 16.) Don’t confuse showtime 
with departure time. The space-A showtime is the listed time that they plan 
to select passengers from the space-A list. If you’re not there to accept when 
your name is called, they move on to the next person on the list, and you 
miss your chance for that flight. Arrive at least one hour before the sched-
uled showtime. Sometimes they call for space A earlier than scheduled.
It can really make your blood pressure rise when you arrive at the terminal 
and lug all of your baggage in, just to find out that all the space-A seats have 
already been taken. When your name is called, sometimes it’s only minutes 
until you go through security for boarding, so be all set and ready to go.

302
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Be Financially Prepared
Remember, you may not travel on the same day you arrive at the terminal. 
You need to have funds available to stay overnight, or possibly for several 
days, because most military terminals close at night. Sometimes veterans 
can stay at an on-base lodging facility for a relatively inexpensive fee (I cover 
these options in Chapter 16). But you can’t count on these being available, so 
you may need to seek commercial lodging off-base.
Additionally, if you have to return home before a certain date, remember that 
your return travel is also space available. If you can’t get a return space-A 
flight that fits your schedule, you need to be prepared to purchase a 
commercial airline ticket.
Purchase an In-Flight Meal
Meals on most commercial airlines leave much to be desired these days. 
Thankfully, I can’t say that about the in-flight meals available for a nominal 
fee on military aircraft.
Often called “boxed lunches” or “boxed meals,” these munchies are very 
good, in my humble opinion. Options include a healthy-heart menu, breakfast 
menu, snacks, and a sandwich meal. Prices usually range from $1.35 to $5.00, 
depending on your choice. You can also bring your own food and drinks 
aboard. Sorry, alcoholic beverages aren’t allowed.
Sign Up Immediately on Arrival 
for Your Return Flight
As soon as you get to your destination, take a few moments before you leave 
the terminal and sign up for your return flight. Your name remains on the 
waiting list for 60 days, which means that while you’re out and about taking 
in the sights and eating too much rich food, you’re getting closer and closer 
to the top of the list for your return flight.
 
It’s often more difficult for veterans and family members to return to the 
United States than to depart from it. That’s because those traveling on pass-
ports must enter the States through designated customs and immigration 
points, whereas active-duty members can enter the United States at virtually 
any military terminal.
