Introduction
T
he Rough Guide Egyptian Arabic dictionary phrasebook is a 
highly practical introduction to the contemporary language. 
Laid out in clear A-Z style, it uses key-word referencing to lead 
you straight to the words and phrases you want – so if you need to 
book a room, just look up ‘room’. The Rough Guide gets straight 
to the point in every situation, in bars and shops, on trains and 
buses, and in hotels and banks.
The main part of the Rough Guide is a double dictionary: 
English-Arabic then Arabic-English. Before that, there’s a section 
called Basic Phrases and to get you involved in two-way com-
munication, the Rough Guide includes, in this new edition, a set 
of Scenario dialogues illustrating questions and responses in key 
situations such as renting a car and asking directions. You can hear 
these and then download them free from www.roughguides.
com/phrasebooks for use on your computer or MP3 player. 
Forming the heart of the guide, the English-Arabic section 
gives easy-to-use transliterations of the Arabic words wherever 
pronunciation might be a problem. Throughout this section, 
cross-references enable you to pinpoint key facts and phrases, while 
asterisked words indicate where further information can be found in 
a section at the end of the book called How the Language Works. 
This section sets out the fundamental rules of the language, with 
plenty of practical examples. You’ll also find here other essentials 
like numbers, dates, telling the time and basic phrases. The Arabic-
English section is in two parts: a dictionary, arranged phonetically, 
of all the words and phrases you’re likely to hear (starting with a 
section of slang and colloquialisms); then a compilation, arranged 
by subject, of various signs, labels, instructions and other basic 
words you may come across in print or in public places.
Near the back of the book too the Rough Guide offers an 
extensive Menu Reader. Consisting of food and drink sections 
(each starting with a list of essential terms), it’s indispensable 
whether you’re eating out, stopping for a quick drink, or brows-
ing through a local food market.
rehla saaeeda!
have a good trip!

Pronunciation
Throughout this book, Arabic words have been transliterated 
into romanized form so that they can be read as though they 
were English bearing in mind the notes on pronunciation 
given below:
Vowels
a	
as in at
ā	
longer a as in car 
ay	
as in say
e	
as in bed
ee	
as in see
i	
as in bit 
ī	
sounds like eye or like the ai in Thai
o	
as in hot
ō	
oa as in moan
ow	 as in now
Consonants
h	
is always pronounced, except in the following com-
binations: gh, kh and sh
j	
as in jam
j	
like the s in leisure
kh	
like the ch in the Scottish word loch
r	
strongly rolled r
s	
as in miss
When double consonants such as bb or mm occur, both letters 
should be pronounced.
Capitals d, s, t and z are like d, s, t and z only more heavily 
pronounced.
Special Sounds
a	
aargh sound, said from the throat, a heavy forced a
gh	
like a French r
h	
an emphatic h, said from the back of the throat
q	
similar to an emphatic pronunciation of ‘cu’ as in cut, 
said from the back of the throat

’	
a glottal stop, similar to that heard in regional forms 
of English when the letter ‘t’ is not pronounced; for 
example, ‘wa’er’ for ‘water’. 
q and ’ represent the same letter in Egyptian Arabic, known 
as the ‘qaf’; however, when represented by q, it is more 
strongly pronounced.
Letters given in bold type indicate the part of the word to be 
stressed.
An asterisk next to a word in the English-Arabic section 
means that you should refer to the How the Language 
Works section for further information.

Arabic and the Arabic alphabet
Classical Arabic, the universal written language of the entire 
Arabic-speaking world, is rarely spoken. Colloquial Arabic 
is the spoken language and its grammar, pronunciation and 
vocabulary vary between countries. The colloquial Arabic 
used in this book is Egyptian.
Arabic is written from right to left. Each letter of the alphabet 
has up to four different forms: one where it stands alone, one at 
the beginning of a word, one in the middle of a word and one 
when it is the final letter. The alphabet as listed below consists 
almost entirely of consonants; Arabic words do not contain 
written short vowels (although the long vowels are written). 
Words consist of a string of consonants and the Arabic speaker 
knows from experience how the vowels must be added in 
speech to make sense. Sometimes, therefore, the same written 
word can often be pronounced in more than one way, but usu-
ally only one version makes sense in a particular context.

Nouns
Gender
All Arabic nouns have one of two genders – masculine or 
feminine. Most nouns ending in -a are feminine:
	
maktaba	
ahwa	
garsona
	
library 	
coffee; café	
waitress
Some nouns that do not end in -a are feminine:
	
bint	
omm	
shams	
floos
	
girl	
mother	
sun	
money
The names of many countries, cities and parts of the body are 
feminine:
	
masr	
aswān	
tanta
	
Egypt	
Aswan	
Tanta
	
rās	
rigl	
eed
	
head	
leg	
hand
Feminine nouns that do not end in -a and are not obviously 
feminine are marked (f) in the English-Arabic section of this 
book.
Some masculine nouns end in -a; these are also indicated in the 
English-Arabic section:
	
howa
	
air (m) 
All other nouns that do not end in -a or fall into the above 
categories can be assumed to be masculine.
Construct Form
Some rules require the final -a of a feminine noun to be 
replaced by -it when two nouns are used together. This is 
known as the construct form:
260
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    N o u n s

	
tarabayza	
akl	
tarabayzit el akl
	
table	
food	
the food table 
	
tazkara	
tīyāra	
tazkarit el tīyāra
	
ticket	
plane	
the plane ticket
The construct form is also used to form the plural of some 
words (see below); it is also used with possessive suffixes (see 
page 268).
Plurals of Nouns
There are three types of plural in Arabic: the dual, the stand-
ard and the collective plural.
Dual Plural
This is used when referring to two of anything. It is formed by 
adding a suffix to the singular form of the noun.
To form the dual plural of masculine nouns and feminine 
nouns that do not end in -a, add -ayn to the noun:
	
mat-haf	
mat-hafayn
	
museum	
two museums
	
atr	
atrayn
	
train	
two trains
To form the dual plural of feminine nouns ending in -a, 
remove the final -a and add -tayn:
	
ezaza	
ezaztayn
	
bottle	
two bottles
	
madrasa	
madrastayn
	
school	
two schools
	
aarabayya	
aarabaytayn
	
car	
two cars
For some nouns, the dual plural is formed by adding -ayn to 
the construct form:
261
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    N o u n s

262
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    N o u n s
	
sha’a	
sha’itayn
	
apartment	
two apartments
	
gizma	
gizmitayn
	
shoe	
two shoes
Standard Plural
To form this, add -een to masculine nouns:

Collective Plural
This plural is used to describe a whole class or group 
of items and it mostly occurs with fruit and vegetables  
collectively and generally. The collective plural of fruit and 
vegetables is more widely used than the singular or standard 
plural. If you need to refer to a singular item, you can do so 
by adding -a to the collective form:
	
toffāh (pl)	
toffāha (sing)
	
apples	
an apple
	
khayār	
khayāra
	
cucumbers	
a cucumber
The singular and standard plural forms of these types of noun 
are only used if it is necessary to specify the number of items:
 
collective plural	
singular 
standard plural
	
mishmish	
mishmisha 	
talat mishmishāt
	
apricots	
an apricot	
three apricots
Further examples of the collective form are: 
	
bayd	
samak	
shaar	
shagar
	
eggs	
fish	
hair

Articles
The definite article (the) is el:
	
magalla	
el magalla
 	
magazine	
the magazine
When the noun begins with d, d, n, r, s, s, sh, t, t, z or z, the 
l is omitted from el and the initial consonant of the noun is 
lengthened. This change is optional for the letters g and k.
Some examples of nouns where el is assimilated:
	
sobh	
es-sobh	
taboor	
et-taboor
	 morning	
the morning	
queue	
the queue
The form of el also changes when it is used with some preposi-
tions:
264
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    A r t i c l e s  /  A d j e c t i v e s
	 bee (by) + el = bil
	 bil gow	
by air
	 fee (in; per) + el = fil
	 fil bahr	
in the sea
	 fil maya	
per cent
	 fil ezāza	
per bottle
	 lee (to) + el = lil
	 lil matār	
to the airport
	 lil fondo’	
to the hotel
	 lil o’sor	
to Luxor
	 aala (on) + el = aalal
	 aalal blāj	
on the beach
	 aalal korsee	on the chair
There is no indefinite article in Arabic. For example:
fondo’ can mean ‘hotel’ or ‘a hotel’
magalla can mean ‘magazine’ or ‘a magazine’
Adjectives
Adjectives come after the noun they describe and agree with 
the noun in gender and number. The masculine form of the 
adjective is given in the English-Arabic and Arabic-English 
sections of this book. The feminine of adjectives is formed by 
adding -a to the masculine:

 
masculine 
feminine
	
beaeed	
beaeeda	
far
	
kebeer	
kebeera	
big
	
el mat-haf beaeed	
el gamaa beaeeda	
	
the museum is far	
the university is far
	
bayt kebeer	
sha’a kebeera	
	
a big house	
a big apartment
Adjectives ending in -ee (for example, adjectives of national-
ity) change as shown below for the feminine:
 
masculine 
feminine
	
amrekānee	
amrekanaya	
American 
 
aarabee	
aarabaya	
Arab 
	
ostrālee	
ostralaya	
Australian 
	
kanadee	
kanadaya	
Canadian 
	
masree	
masraya	
Egyptian 
	
ingleezee	
ingleezaya	
English 
If you use awee (very) with an adjective then this always fol-
lows the adjective it refers to:
el atr sareea awee
the train is very quick
If the definite article is used then it must be repeated in front 
of the adjective(s) that refer to the noun:
	
el mahatta er-ra’eesaya	
el mat-haf el qowmee
	
the main station	
the national museum
	
el gizma es-sōda
	
the black shoes
Plural Adjectives
If a plural noun refers to people then the plural form of the 
adjective must be used. To form this, add -een to the singular 
adjective:
265
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    A d j e c t i v e s

 
sing 
plural
	
momtāz	
momtāzeen	
excellent
	
tabbākheen momtāzeen	
excellent chefs
If a plural noun refers to inanimate objects, the feminine  
singular form of the adjective must be used (irrespective of the 
gender of the noun):
 
feminine	
byoot kebeera	
big houses
 
masculine	 otobeesāt sareeaa	 fast buses
A dual plural noun should always be followed by a plural  
adjective, for example:
	
a’lamayn kobār	
two large pens
Irregular Plural Adjectives
Many plural adjectives are irregular. Here is a list of the most 
common ones:
 
singular 
plural
	
gameel	
gomāl	
beautiful
	
rekhees	
rokhās	
cheap
	
nedeef	
nodāf

ahmar	
homr

soghīyar	
soghār	
small
	
shedeed	
shodād

Comparatives and Superlatives
The comparative (more expensive, bigger etc) and superla-
tive (best, biggest etc) forms of the adjective are the same in 
Arabic. They do not change according to either gender or 
number.
Some common comparatives and superlatives are as follows:
266
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    A d j e c t i v e s

soghīyar	 small	
asghar	 smaller/smallest
	
shemmāma akbar	
el shemmāma el akbar
	
a bigger melon	
the bigger/biggest melon
To compare two things, use the comparative form of the 
adjective and min (than):
	 	
abaad min	
aswān abaad min asyoot
	 	
further than	
Aswan is further (away) than Asiut
Demonstratives
Demonstrative pronouns and adjectives are as follows:
da 	 this (one); that (one) (m sing)
dee 	 this (one); that (one) (f sing); these; those (referring to 
objects or animals)
dōl 	 these; those (referring to people)
Demonstratives agree in number and gender with the noun 
they refer to. The word order when using demonstratives is:
el + noun + demonstrative adjective
	
el gamal da	
el ezāza dee
	
this/that camel	
this/that bottle
267
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    A d j e c t i v e s  /  D e m o n s t r a t i v e s

		
es-sowā’een dōl	
es-settat dōl
		
these/those drivers	
these/those women
		
el hīwanāt dee	
		
these/those animals
When the gender of a demonstrative is uncertain, then  
either dee or da may be used:
	
dee/da ahsan	
	momkin akhod dee/da?
	 that’s better	
can I have that one? 
Possessives
Possessive adjectives are not separate words in Arabic; they 
are in the form of suffixes that are added to the noun to  
indicate the possessive. They are added either to a masculine 
noun or to the construct form of a feminine noun  
(see page 260).
The possessive suffixes are:
	
-ee	 my	
-ha	
her
	
-ak	 your (m sing)	
-na	
our
	
-ik	
your (f sing)	
-koo	
your (pl)
	
-oo	 his	
-hom	 their
	
	
alamee	
tazkartak	
tazkartik
	
my pen	
your ticket	
your ticket 
	
	
(said to a man)	
(said to a woman)
	
aarabayyitna	
bayt-hom
	
our car	
their house
Possession can also be expressed using btāa (of ). There are 
different forms of btāa, depending on whether the object pos-
sessed is masculine or feminine. These forms are also used to 
express the possessive pronoun (mine, yours etc):
 
268
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    D e m o n s t r a t i v e s  /  P o s s e s s i v e s

m object 
f object
	
btāaee	
btaatee	
my; mine
	
btāaak	
btaatak	
your; yours (to a man)
	
btāaik	
btaatik	
your; yours (to a woman)
	
btāaoo	
btaatoo	
his
	
btaaha	
btaait-ha	
her; hers
	
btaana	
btaaitna	
our; ours
	
btaakoo	
btaaitkoo	
your; yours (pl)
	
btaahom	 btaait-hom	 their; theirs
The word order is: definite article + noun + btāa
	
el gizma btaatee	
el korsee btāaee
	
my shoe; the shoe is mine	
my chair; the chair is mine 
	
dee btaatee! (f)	
el kitāb btāaee
	
that/this is mine!	
my book; the book is mine
	
el bayt btāaee
	 my house; the house is mine
btāa should only be used for objects and animals, not when 
referring to people. For example, to say ‘my father’ you must 
use the suffix form of the possessive on page 268. btāa should 
always be used with any word that originates from a foreign 
language:
	
el forsha btaatee
	
my toothbrush
Pronouns
Subject Pronouns
Subject pronouns are as follows:
	 ana	
I	
hayya	
she; it
	 inta	
you (m sing)	
ehna	
we
	 inti	
you (f sing)	
intoo	
you (pl)
	
howa	 he; it	
homma	 they
269
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    P o s s e s s i v e s  /  P r o n o u n s

In Arabic, subject pronouns may be omitted when the form of 
the verb makes it obvious who the subject of the sentence is. 
ana (I) is most likely to be omitted: 
	
katabt	
I wrote
Direct and Indirect Object Pronouns
Direct object (me, you etc) or indirect object (to me, to you 
etc) personal pronouns in Arabic are in the form of suffixes 
that are added to the verb:
 
direct object 
indirect object
	
-ee	
me	
-nee	
to me
	
-ak	
you (m sing)	
-lak	
to you (m sing)
	
-ik	
you (f sing)	
-lik	
to you (f sing)
	
-oo	
him; it	
-loo	
to him; to it
	
-ha	
her; it	
-lha	
to her; to it
	
-na	
us	
-lina	
to us
	
-koo	
you (pl)	
-likoo	
to you (pl)
	
-hom	
them	
-lihom	 to them
	
sallimt aalayhom 	
bahebboo/bahebbaha (m/f)
	 I greeted them	
I like it
	
haddeelak/haddeelik el wahda bekhamsa genayh 	
	 	 (to man/woman)
	 I’ll give it to you for five pounds
When a sentence contains both direct and indirect object pro-
nouns, the word order is the same as in English:
verb + direct object + indirect object
eddeehanee!
give it to me!
Pronouns and Prepositions
Pronoun suffixes are often added to prepositions. The suffixes 
vary depending on whether the preposition ends in a conso-
nant or a vowel: 
270
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    P r o n o u n s

like	
on; against; for
	
da minnoo	
hayya taweela zayik	
da aalashanhom?
 	 that’s from him	
she’s tall like you	
is that for them? 
‘Of’
Phrases such as ‘the name of the street’ are expressed as fol-
lows:
noun (possessed) + el + noun (possessor)
	
ism esh-shārea	
ainwān el mat-haf	 
	
the name of the street	
the address of the museum
	
raqam el otobees	
	
the number of the bus
Feminine nouns that are possessed are in the construct form 
(see page 260):
	
shantit el bint
	
the girl’s bag
To make the phrase indefinite, omit the definite article:
	
hettit aaysh	
mahattit otobees	
	
a piece of bread	
a bus stop

Verbs
Basic Verb Forms
There is no infinitive (to do, to buy etc) in Arabic. Instead, 
the basic form of the verb (the root) is the perfect tense of the 
third person masculine singular. This form is shown in the first 
column in the table of Arabic verbs below.
Where in English sentences you would use an infinitive, in  
Arabic both verbs must agree with the subject of the sen-
tence:
aīzeen nakol 	
 
we want to eat
The table shows the basic form of the verb (third person mas-
culine singular, perfect tense) and the first person singular of 
the two Arabic tenses (see pages 273-275):

Tenses
There are only two true tenses of the verb in Arabic: the 
imperfect (indicates incomplete action in the present or the 
future) and the perfect (indicates completed action in the 
past). Whether the present or future is meant, is indicated by 
the different prefixes added to the imperfect verb form.
Imperfect Tense
The imperfect tense is used to make general statements and 
is formed by adding prefixes and suffixes to the verb stem. 
To obtain the verb stem, remove the initial a- from the first 
person singular imperfect form in the table above:
ashrab (I drink) gives the stem -shrab 
The basic conjugation is obtained by adding the following 
prefixes and suffixes to the stem. 
273
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    Ve r b s

verb stem -shrab
 
prefix/suffix

she drinks
	
ni-	
nishrab	
we drink
	
ti-...-oo	
tishraboo	 you drink (pl)
	
yi-...-oo	
yishraboo	 they drink
You will find that sometimes the first vowel of the verb is pro-
nounced or transliterated as e or i in different verbs, depending 
on the actual sound of the word.
Present Usage 
The imperfect conjugation is used for the equivalent of the 
present tense. The prefix bi- is added to the forms of the 
imperfect tense to indicate that the action is taking place in 
the present:
	 verb stem -shrab
	 biashrab	
I am drinking
	 bitishrab	
you are drinking (m sing)
	 bitishrabee	
you are drinking (f sing)
	 biyishrab	
he is drinking
	 bitishrab	
she is drinking
	 binishrab	
we are drinking
	 bitishraboo	
you are drinking (pl)
	 biyishraboo	
they are drinking
Future Usage
To indicate that an action will take place in the future, use the 
imperfect conjugation as above and modify it as follows, add-
ing the prefix ha-:
274

he will drink
	
hatishrab	
she will drink
	
hanishrab	
we will drink
	
hatishraboo	 you will drink (pl)
	
hīshraboo	
they will drink
Perfect Tense
The perfect tense is used to indicate completed action in the 
past. It is the equivalent of the simple past and the perfect tense 
in English. Therefore, ‘ana kallimtoo’ translates as ‘I spoke to 
him’ or ‘I have spoken to him’ depending on the context.
The perfect tense is formed by adding suffixes to the third 
person masculine singular form.
Most verbs follow the pattern of the perfect conjugation 
below:
verb stem katab-
 
suffix
	
-t	
katabt	
I wrote, I have written
	
-t	
katabt	
you wrote, you have written (m sing)
	
-tee

you wrote, you have written (f sing)
	
	
katab

-it

-na	
katabna	
we wrote, we have written
	
-too	
katabtoo	
you wrote, you have written (pl)
	
-oo	
kataboo

Exceptions are the verbs ‘give’, ‘like’ and ‘put’. For these, 
remove -ayt from the forms in the perfect column on pages 
272-273 to obtain the verb stem and then add the following 
suffixes:

‘To Be’
There is no present tense of the verb ‘to be’ in Arabic:
	
agaztak imta? (to man)	
ana min iskinderaya
	 when is your vacation?	
I’m from Alexandria
 
lit: vacation your (suffix) when 
lit: I from Alexandria
	
el mat-haf el masree kebeer	
kitābak da? 
	 the Egyptian Museum is big	
is this your book?
 
lit: the museum the Egyptian big 
lit: book your (suffix) this
In the past tense the verb ‘to be’ is as follows:
	
ana kont	
I was
	
inta kont	
you were (m sing)
	
inti kontee	
you were (f sing)
	
howa kan	
he was; it was

intoo kontoo	
you were (pl)
	
homma kanoo	
they were
	
kanoo fayn homma?	
where were they?
	
kānit fayn?	
where was it?
Negatives are formed in the standard way (see page 279):
	
inti makonteesh	
you weren’t
	
homma makanoosh	 they weren’t
276
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    Ve r b s

mafeesh	
there isn’t; there aren’t
	
kan fee	
there was; there were
	
makansh fee

‘To Have’
The preposition aand is used with the possessive suffixes to 
form the present tense of ‘to have’:
	
aandee	
I have

all m sing forms	
gī	
rīeh	
fāhim
 
all f sing forms	
gīya	
rīha	
fahma
 
all plural forms	
gīyeen	 rīheen	 fahmeen
For example:
	 ana rīeh	
inti fahma?
	 I’m going	
do you understand?
To make these negative, add the word mish before the  
verbal form:
278
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    Ve r b s

279
H OW  T H E  L A N G UAG E  W O R K S   ■    Ve r b s
	
ana mish rīeh
	 I’m not going
Negatives
To form the negative, add ma- to the beginning of the verb 
and -sh to the end:
	
bashrab	
mabashrabsh
	 I drink	
I don’t drink
	
aamalt	
maaamaltish
	 I did	
I haven’t done
Another way of making a verb negative is to place the word 
mish before the verb:
	
ana māshee	
mish māshee
	 I am going	
I am not going
There are a few verbs which must take the mish form of the 
negative. For example, ‘to want’ and the alternatives of the 
present tense mentioned above (i.e. ‘to go’, ‘to come’ and ‘to 
understand’). 
	
mish rīeh	
mish fāhim	
mish gīya
	 I am not going	
I don’t understand	
I am not coming
Imperative
To form an imperative, take the second person singular or 
plural of the imperfect tense and remove the initial t-:
	
	
ishrab!
	 drink up!
Some other useful imperatives are:
	
o’aod!	
warrehālee	
estanna hena
	 sit down!	
show it to me 	
stay here
	
imshee!	
o’af!	
taaala hena!
	 go away!	
stop!	
come here!

To form the negative imperative take the second person singu-
lar or plural of the verb in the imperfect tense and add ma- at 
the beginning and -sh at the end:
	
matrohsh!	
matestannash	
matbossish
	 don’t go! 	
don’t wait	
don’t look
Questions
To change a statement into a question, use the same  
intonation at the end as you would in English:
	
da tohfa	
da tohfa?
	 it’s an antique	
it’s an antique?
Interrogatives
	
fayn?	
lay?	
imta?	
izzay?
	
where?	
why?	
when?	
how?
Interrogatives usually come at the end of a question. They 
are sometimes used at the beginning of a sentence for special 
emphasis:
	
el mat-haf fayn?	
	
OR fayn el mat-haf?  
	 where is the museum?
Dates
In business, Egypt uses the Western calendar; for Islamic 
holidays and festivals, legal and state affairs the lunar calendar 
is used. 
Use the numbers on pages 284-285 to form dates. For the first 
of the month, the ordinal can also be used. The word order 
for dates is:
day + month + year
