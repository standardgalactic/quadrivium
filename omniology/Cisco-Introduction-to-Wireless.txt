Radio Basics
• Waves are measured by 
frequency of movement
• Radio devices operate in 
bands or a designated 
frequency range
Frequency = f = V / ??(m/sec)

Regulation of Wireless
• Radio Frequency (RF) is a scarce 
and shared resource
Each country regulates the use of the radio 
spectrum by a government agency 
In the U.S. it is the F.C.C. that allocates 
spectrum for use and resolves conflict 
disputes)
Internationally coordinated through 
the ITU (International Telecommunications 
Union)

16
Spectrum Licensing
• Spectrum can be allocated for specific users
Civil, government or military
Acquired via auction or “beauty contest”
• Unlicensed or Industrial, Scientific and 
Medical (ISM) bands
In most countries does not require a license, but 
may require registration
Needs to conform to power and other parameters 
to reduce interference

Transmitting a Signal
• The goal of sending data over RF is to get 
information across with as much data as 
possible, sending it as far as possible and 
as fast as possible
• More data can be placed on a signal in one 
of two ways:
More frequency used
Complex modulation

Radio Modulation
•
High speed modem compresses 
the data to use the same line as an 
old 300 baud modem; this means 
the same bandwidth is available
•
56K modems require a better 
(quieter) phone line to 
communicate at the higher speed
•
If there is noise on the line, the 
modem will drop down in speed 
to connect
•
Mode noise, less speed
•
Complex modulation requires 
better signal strength, therefore 
less coverage is available

Antenna Concepts
• Directionality
Omni (360 degree coverage) directional
Directional (limited range of coverage)
• Gain
Measured in dBi and dBd. (0 dBd = 2.14 dBi)
More gain means more coverage—
in certain directions!
• Polarization
Antennas are used in the vertical polarization

34
Antenna Gain
• In life you never get ‘something for 
nothing,’ the same is true in antenna gain
• If the gain of an antenna goes up, the 
coverage area or angle goes down
• Coverage areas or radiation patterns are 
measured in degrees
• These angles are referred to as 
beamwidth, and have a horizontal and 
vertical measurement

Antenna Theory
• A theoretical antenna 
(Isotropic) has 
a perfect 360 degree 
vertical and  
horizontal beamwidth
• This is a reference for 
all antennas

36
Antenna Theory—Dipole
•
To obtain omnidirectional 
gain from an isotropic 
antenna, the energy lobes 
are ‘pushed in’ from the top 
and bottom, and forced out in 
a doughnut type pattern
•
The higher the gain smaller 
the vertical beamwidth, and 
the more horizontal lobe area
•
This is the typical dipole 
pattern; gain of a dipole is 
2.14dBi (0dBd)

37
High Gain Omnidirectionals
• High gain 
omnidirectional antennas 
will create more 
coverage area in far 
distances, but the energy 
level directly below the 
antenna will become 
lower, and coverage here 
may be poor

38
Directional Antennas
• For directional 
antennas the lobes 
are pushed in a 
certain direction, 
causing the energy to 
move be condensed in 
a particular area
• Very little energy is in 
the back side of a 
directional antenna

Diversity and Multipath
• In a multipath 
environment, signals 
null points are located 
throughout the area
• Moving the antenna 
slightly will allow you 
to move out of a null 
point and receive the 
signal correctly

Multipath and FH
• The distance an RF wave 
travels, how it bounces and 
where the multipath nulls 
occur are based on the 
wavelength of the frequency
• As frequency changes, so 
does the wavelength
• Therefore as frequency 
changes, so will the location 
of the multipath null

Multipath (Cont.)
• Multipath signals can cause 
high RF signal strength, but 
poor signal quality levels
• Bottom line 
Low RF signal strength does not mean 
poor communications
Low signal quality DOES mean poor 
communications

Why Is It Called Cellular?
•
Originally one set of frequencies 
across a metro
•
Limited number of simultaneous 
conversations
•
Idea was to allocate a subset of 
frequencies to small areas or”cells”
•
Allowed re -use of frequency sets as 
long as not adjacent
•
Vastly increased capacity
•
Shrink cell sizes to add even more
•
Mobility (call hand-off) required
•
Roaming

Radio Frequencies
• Licenses are required
• Most common frequency bands are 800, 
900, 1800 and 1900 Mhz
• No single worldwide standard for roaming
Some regions or countries use a single 
standard and frequencies (mandated)
Some countries use more than one standard 
and frequencies (open market or 
less regulated)

Spectrum Allocation for Mobile 
Wireless Services
• GSM, PHS, and PCS are the current systems used for 
digital wireless communications in Europe, Japan, and 
the U.S., respectively
• IMT 2000 (International Mobile Telecommunications) is the 
official term referring to 3G services

The Road to IP
1st Phase: Circuit Data Services
•
BSS routes the call to the MSC
•
MSC recognizes the call as data and initiates a 
V.110 call setup to the PSTN-SS7 network
•
MSC packs the raw asynchronous data into the 
64K ISDN data channel
•
Call is routed to Cisco AS5300 or AS5800 universal 
access servers capable of terminating the V.110 call

•
Higher speed interfaces and “always-on” 
data services, and enable operators to 
charge by packet instead of connect time
•
A PCU (Packet Control Unit) in the BSC 
converts data traffic to packets and steers 
it to the GPRS (in GSM networks) or the 
PDSN (in CDMA systems) where it 
accesses the packet network

• IEEE 802.11B became a standard in 
September 1999
• Three technologies defined:
FHSS—1 Mbps and 2 Mbps
DSSS—2 Mbps and 11Mb
Infrared
• 802.11 defines a high-performance radio
• 802.11 promises true vendor interoperability (over 
the air)

Direct Sequence Modulation
• Each data bit becomes a string of chips 
(chipping sequence) transmitted in parallel 
across a wide frequency range
• Minimum chip rate per the FCC is 10; Aironet 
uses 11 for 1 and 2 MB data rates
If the data bit was: 1001
Chipping code is:   1=00110011011          0=11001100100
Transmitted data would be:
00110011011      11001100100      11001100100    0110011011

Data Rates
• The “over-the-air” data rate at a given range 
and given similar implementations will favor 
DSSS by a factor of 2 to 1  
• A 1 Mbps DSSS system should have twice 
the range of a 1 Mbps FHSS 
• 2 Mbps DSSS system will offer comparable 
range to 1 Mbps FHSS technology 
• For these reasons, the data rate advantage 
goes to DSSS

RANGE—FH vs DS
• Because of this processing gain, the DSSS 
technology will have more range than 
FHSS at a given data rate
