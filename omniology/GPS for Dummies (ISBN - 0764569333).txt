About the Author
Joel McNamara first got involved with digital maps in the early 1980’s. At the
time he was studying archeology and instead of going out and playing Indiana
Jones, he found himself in front of a computer monitor trying to predict
where archeological sites were located based on LANDSAT satellite data.
The lure of computers ultimately led to his defection from academia to the
software industry, where he worked as a programmer, technical writer, and
manager; eventually ending up at a rather large software company based in
Redmond, Washington. Joel now writes and consults on technology he finds
interesting, such as GPS and digital maps.
Over the years he’s had practical experience using GPS and maps for wild-
land firefighting, search and rescue, and disaster response and planning. He’s
also an avid user of the great outdoors (which means there’s way too much
gear in his garage), competes in adventure races and other endurance sports,
and so far has always found his way back home. In his spare time he volun-
teers for a federal Disaster Medical Assistance Team.
This is his second book. The first was Secrets of Computer Espionage: Tactics
& Countermeasures (also published by Wiley), a reference guide for computer
security practitioners and anyone interested in stopping sneaky spies.


Author’s Acknowledgments
First off, thanks to my wife, Darcy, for her support during my work on this
book, especially for putting up with all of the maps, CD-ROMs, cables, manu-
als, and GPS receivers scattered all over the house during the duration.
Next on the list are the folks at Wiley, including Katie Feltman, my acquisi-
tions editor and Pat O’Brien, my project editor. And a special note of appreci-
ation to GPS and map guru Gavin Hoban, who diligently served as my
technical editor.
I’d also like to thank the following manufacturers for supplying review copies
of their products to write about: DeLorme (Caleb Mason), Endless Pursuit
(Jack Robson), Lowrance (Steve Wegrzyn and Luke Morris), Magellan (Angela
Linsey-Jackson), Maptech (Martin Fox), Microsoft, National Geographic, and
TopoFusion (Scott Morris). I especially appreciate the help from the folks
named in the parentheses who went above and beyond the call of duty in
answering questions and providing assistance.
Finally, I’d like to express thanks to the following people for giving me feed-
back on various parts of the book: Bob Daley, Jan Daley, Cynthia Engel, Jeff
Madden, Doug McNamara, and Judy McNamara.

Introduction
A
s you may have guessed from the title, this book is about GPS (the 
satellite-based Global Positioning System) and maps; digital maps 
to be exact.
I remember back in 1989 when Magellan introduced the first handheld GPS
receiver, the NAV 1000. (Don’t worry. This isn’t going to be one of those
“I used to walk 20 miles to school in the snow when I was your age,” stories.)
The NAV 1000 was the size of a brick, and weighed a little less than two
pounds. It was single channel receiver, could only track four satellites, and
just supported latitude and longitude coordinates. It could save 100 way-
points and you could have a single route with up to 10 waypoints. It cost
$2,500.
Fast forward to the present. Now I can go down to my neighborhood sporting
goods store and buy a GPS receiver smaller than a small cell phone. It weighs
a couple of ounces, can track up to 12 satellites, and on a good day tells me
exactly where I’m located to within about 10 feet; and in several different
coordinate systems by the way. It supports 500 waypoints and 20 routes, with
125 waypoints apiece. Best of all it costs around $100.
Maps have followed the same evolutionary path. Paper maps have turned
digital and now you can visit a Web site and print out a map with driving
directions to just about anywhere for free. For under $100 you can buy map-
ping software that has a collection of CD-ROMs with detailed topographic
maps that fully cover any state in the United States. Aerial photographs are
readily available over the Internet, and stunning three-dimensional maps can
be created with a few mouse clicks. Once the exclusive domain of profes-
sional cartographers and GIS (Geographic Information System) specialists,
the average computer user can create and use digital maps with relative ease.
There are a number of free and inexpensive programs that make desktop
mapping a reality for the rest of us.
So, does all this mean we’re entering the dawn of a new era where no matter
where you are it’s going to be hard to get lost? Well, yes and no.

Over the past several years, GPS receivers have become extremely popular
and affordable. Lots of people who venture away from urban areas are carry-
ing them. Cars come installed with GPS navigation systems for negotiating
city streets and highways. Cell phones are even starting to show up with tiny
GPS receivers embedded inside. And even if you don’t have a GPS receiver
you can always go out on the Web and print a map of where you want to go.
But, there are a few hitches in this perfect, always found world:
 GPS receivers tend to boast so many features it’s easy to get lost trying
to figure them all out. Plus, most GPS receiver owners typically only use
a small subset of the available features (and sometimes don’t even know
how to use these features well enough to avoid getting lost).
 GPS receivers have capabilities and limitations that many owners
(or potential owners) really don’t understand. This leads to frustration
or not being able to use the devices to their full potential.
 While many people have a general knowledge of how to read a map, at
least the simple road variety, most don’t know how to really maximize
using a map.
 And finally, the average computer user isn’t aware of the wealth of easy-
to-use, free or inexpensive mapping resources he or she could be using
to stay found.
The purpose of this book is to help you better understand and use GPS
receivers and open your eyes to the world of digital mapping. And hopefully
put you on the path of always staying found or finding what you’re looking for.
Who This Book Is For
If you’re browsing through this book at your favorite bookstore right now,
and are wondering whether this book is for you, ask yourself these questions:
 Are you considering purchasing a GPS receiver?
 Have you recently purchased a GPS receiver?
 Have you owned a GPS receiver for a while, but want to get more out of it?
 Are you interested in using digital maps for your profession or hobby?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, then stop reading and immedi-
ately proceed to the cash register, because this book will make your life
easier (if you’re still not convinced, feel free to continue flipping through the
pages to see what I mean).

GPS For Dummies 

Getting a bit more specific, people in the following groups should find this
book especially useful:
 Recreation – Hikers, hunters, fishers, mountain bikers, trail runners,
cross country skiers, snowshoers, snowmobilers, ATV and 4 x 4 drivers,
prospectors, pilots, paddlers, geocachers, and anyone else who ven-
tures outdoors away from cities and streets (with or without a GPS
receiver).
 Commercial – Land developers and real estate agents who are interested
in the competitive advantage maps can bring them for planning or mar-
keting purposes.
 Government – Emergency response agencies (search and rescue, fire, law
enforcement, disaster relief) and urban planners who use maps as part
of their planning and response activities.
 Environmental – Conservation agencies, organizations, consultants and
scientists (biologists, botanists, and other ists) who use maps for
resource management and research.
 Technology – Anyone who likes to play with cool technology.
You may have noticed I didn’t mention people like surveyors or GIS profes-
sionals. If your job primarily focuses on GPS and/or maps, you’ll probably
discover a few things in the following pages, but just remember that this
book is for the average computer user and GPS receiver owner who doesn’t
have your level of technical experience, proficiency, and skills. Please don’t
expect to find the nuts and bolts and details of using GIS software or preci-
sion surveying electronics.
Setting Some GPS Expectations
Before getting started, I’d like to set a few expectations about the content
you’ll be reading about that relates to GPS receivers, just so we’re all on the
same page:
 This book focuses on handheld, consumer GPS receivers typically used
for land navigation. In addition to these types of GPS receivers there are
larger and less portable consumer and commercial models that are used
in airplanes, boats, and vehicles. There are also restricted-use GPS units
used by the U.S. government and military, and expensive receivers used
for surveying. While some of these GPS receivers are discussed briefly,
don’t expect to find out as much about them as about the portable, con-
sumer models.
3
Introduction

 While most GPS receivers have the same functionality, there are a lot of
differences in manufacturer and model user interfaces. In a way it’s like
sitting someone down in front of three personal computers, one running
Microsoft Windows XP, one running Linux (with the KDE or Gnome inter-
face), and the other a Macintosh, and asking a computer novice volun-
teer to perform an identical set of tasks on each of the computers. Good
luck! Because of this, you’re not going to find detailed instructions on
how to use specific GPS receiver models. What you will find is informa-
tion on how to use most any GPS receiver, with some kindly suggestions
tossed in when it’s appropriate to consult your user’s guide for details.
 Finally, don’t expect me to tell you what’s the best GPS receiver. Like any
consumer electronics product, GPS receiver models are constantly
changing and being updated. Instead of recommending that you buy a
certain brand or model (that could possibly be replaced by something
cheaper and better over the course of a few months), I’ll tell you what
questions to ask when selecting a GPS receiver and give you some hints
on which features are best for different activities. You’ll be able to apply
these questions and selection criteria to pretty much any GPS receiver
(no matter how much the marketplace changes), to pick the right model
for you.
Take comfort in the fact that it’s pretty hard to go wrong when you purchase
a GPS receiver from one of the Big Three manufacturers (Garmin, Magellan,
and Lowrance). All these companies make excellent products, and you can
expect to get a number of years use out of them. (The good news is that GPS
technology and product features haven’t changed as rapidly as personal com-
puters. I can go out and happily use a GPS receiver from 1998, whereas the
same vintage personal computer would have been recycled a long time ago.)
How This Book Is Organized
This book is conveniently divided into several different parts. The content in
each part tends to be related, but by all means, feel free to skip around and
read about what interests you the most.
Part I: All About Digital Maps
This part of the book introduces you to digital maps; actually it presents
some important universal concepts that apply to both paper and digital maps
such as coordinate systems, datums, and how to read and use maps. The
focus is primarily on land maps but there are a few brief mentions of nautical
and aeronautical charts. In this part you’ll find out about different types of
4
GPS For Dummies 

digital maps that are available, especially the free ones you can get from the
Internet and about some of the software you can use for digital mapping.
Part II: All About GPS
This is the part of the book devoted to demystifying GPS and GPS receivers.
You’ll find out about the technology behind GPS (including its capabilities
and limitations), basic GPS concepts such as waypoints, routes, tracks, and
coordinate systems, how to select and use a GPS receiver, how to use GPS
with PDAs (like Pocket PCs and Palms), and all about the popular GPS sport
of geocaching.
Part III: Digital Mapping
on Your Computer
In this part we’ll take some of the theoretical information on digital maps
from Part I, and get practical. This section discusses computer requirements
needed for basic digital mapping and reviews a number of different software
packages you can use to work with aerial photos and topographic and road
maps. Many of these programs support uploading and downloading data to
and from GPS receivers, so we’ll also spend some time talking about how to
interface a GPS receiver to a personal computer.
Part IV: Using Web-Hosted
Mapping Services
Even if you don’t have a GPS receiver or mapping software installed on your
computer, with an Internet connection and a Web browser you can still do a
remarkable amount of digital mapping with free and subscription Web ser-
vices. This section discusses how to access and use online street maps, topo-
graphic maps, aerial photos, and some slick U.S. government-produced maps.
You’ll also discover how to save and edit these Web-based maps.
Part V: The Part of Tens
All Dummies books have a part called The Part of Tens, and this one is no
exception. In this section you’ll find lists of what I consider the best GPS and
digital map Web sites on the Internet, where to find free digital maps, tips and
5
Introduction

hints on printing maps, and if you’re a competitive or recreational athlete,
how to use a GPS receiver in your outdoor workouts.
Icons Used in This Book
Maps use symbols to quickly convey information, and this book does the
same by using icons to help you navigate your way around. They include:
Just a gentle little reminder about something of importance, and because I
can’t be there to mention it in person and give you a friendly but stern look
while wagging my finger, this icon will have to do.
I’ve tried to keep the real geeky, nerdy things to a bare minimum, but because
this is a book about cool electronic gadgets and computer mapping, some-
times the technical stuff does creep in. I’ll either give you a plain-English
explanation or point you off to a Web site where you can get additional details.
This is good stuff designed to make your life easier; usually gained from
practical experience and typically never found in manufacturer user guides
and product documentation; or if it is there, it’s buried in some obscure
paragraph.
The little bomb icon looks like it should signify some pretty bad juju, but in
reality it could represent something as minor as potentially causes a hangnail.
The key here is to pay attention, because there might be something lurking
that causes mental, physical, emotional, or monetary suffering of some
degree. Who would have thought reading GPS and Maps for Dummies could
be an extreme sport?
Some Opening Thoughts
Before you jump into the exciting world of GPS and digital maps, and I know
you can’t wait, there are a couple final things I’d like to mention:
 There are lots of references to Web sites in this book. Unfortunately Web
sites change just about as fast as street maps in a city experiencing a lot
of growth. If for some reason a link doesn’t work, you should have
enough information to find what you’re looking for by using a search
engine such as Google.
 You’re not going to find every GPS and map software title in existence
mentioned in the book. I’ve tried to list and describe many of the more
popular programs, but the realities of page count constraints prevents
6
GPS For Dummies 

this book from turning into an encyclopedia. So please don’t get upset if
I didn’t mention a program you use or you feel slighted because I ended
up talking about one program more than another.
 On some occasions while you’re reading this book you’re probably going
to think I’m starting to sound like a broken record on one point I feel is
very important. If you venture out away from civilization with your GPS
receiver, please bring a compass and a paper map with you, and know
how to use all of them. That means really knowing how to use them, not
just kidding yourself that you do. From many years of doing search and
rescue work and finding lost people, I’ve discovered the following truths:
• GPS receiver batteries die at the most inopportune time; especially
when you didn’t bring spare batteries with you.
• If a GPS receiver breaks or gets lost, it will be at the worst possible
moment.
• GPS receivers are not Star Trek teleporters that will instantly trans-
port you out of the wilderness and trouble (this is also true when it
comes to cell phones).
 All the information in this book should set you on your way to becoming
an expert with a GPS receiver and maps. That is, if you go out and prac-
tice! If you want to have guru status you need to be out there applying
what you discover in this book. Even if you don’t aspire to becoming one
with GPS and a master of maps, in order to get the most use out of your
navigation tools you need to become both comfortable and confident
with them. Discover, experiment, and have fun!

W
hile digital maps are made up of bits and bytes,
they share a number of things in common with
their paper and ink cousins — like datums, coordinates
systems, scales, legends, and compass roses. In fact if you
get some of these concepts down, which hopefully you
will after reading this part, you’ll be at home with just
about any map you encounter, whether it’s displayed on
your PC’s monitor or laying on the front seat of your car.
Paper maps have a certain old school charm, but digital
maps are infinitely cooler. That’s because you can associ-
ate data with a digital map and make it interactive and
smart. This part sets the stage for other chapters in the
book. We’re going to be talking about all sorts of PC, Web-
based, and GPS maps, and it’s important that you under-
stand the basics of how digital maps work and what types
of digital maps are out there; especially the free ones
available on the Internet.

In This Chapter

 Understanding the differences between Geographic Information System (GIS) and 
consumer mapping programs
T
his chapter introduces you to the fundamentals of digital maps. You find
out what a digital map is, the differences between static and smart digital
maps, and the different types of programs available for using digital maps.
What Is a Digital Map?
Any map is a picture of where things are, generally associated with our planet
and its geographic or man-made features. Road maps, hiking maps, maps to
Hollywood stars, and all sorts of other maps provide a sense of place and often
help you get from one place to another.
Most maps are printed on paper. That’s pretty convenient. They can be folded
into a lightweight, compact bundle (if you’ve had a little practice). Digital maps
(maps made on a computer or meant to be used with a computer) serve the
same purpose as their paper cousins. It’s just more difficult to fold a CD.
Digital mapmaking is a significant leap forward from traditional paper maps.
 Maps can be made faster, cheaper, and more accurately.
This is important because of how quickly new roads, subdivisions, and
development projects pop up in fast-growing urban areas. An old street
map isn’t much help in a new subdivision with a couple of hundred
homes. The same problem affects political maps; an example is the
change in national names and borders after the end of the Soviet Union.
 Digital map data can be used with mapping software to make digital
maps on your personal computer.

Read on to discover the many types of digital maps.
Static map
A static map is the simplest form of digital map. Often it’s a paper map that’s
been scanned and turned into a BMP (bitmap) or JPG (graphic) file. Aside
from displaying it, printing it, and perhaps making a few edits, what you can
do with the map is limited.
Static maps used to be the only type; often, a static map is all you need.
Smart map
Smart digital maps (as shown in Figure 1-1) may look like static maps, but
data is associated with map locations. The data can be as basic as the lati-
tude and longitude of a point, or as detailed about vegetation, soil type, and
slope.
Spatial or geospatial data is associated with a place. The place can be 
smaller than a meter or as large as a country. Spatial data can be stored 
two ways:
 Embedded in a map graphic file
 Separate files with references to the locations
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a popular format for storing graphics files.
The GeoTIFF extension embeds geographic tags into map images. If you view
a GeoTIFF file with a standard graphics program, it looks like an ordinary map.
A program that uses the data tags can access the spatial data associated with
each pixel in the image.
12
Part I: All About Digital Maps 
Making maps
Cartography is the art and science of making
maps. Until the 1960s, maps were made the time-
honored, traditional way:
1. Draw an original map by hand, based on land
survey measurements and other information.
2. Print as many copies as you need.
That changed with the advent of computers,
satellite imagery, and Global Positioning System
(GPS), which made making maps much easier.
Most paper maps now are generated or pro-
duced on a computer.

Mapping Programs
Although many different kinds of mapping programs are available, you can
classify map programs in two types: consumer programs and Geographic
Information System (GIS) software. Here is a quick look at each type.
Consumer programs
A consumer mapping program is software that displays street maps, topo-
graphic maps, marine charts, or aeronautical charts. Such mapping programs

Chapter 1: Getting Started with Digital Maps

are easier to use (and much less expensive) than their professional counter-
parts, meeting most computer users’ mapping needs.
This book focuses on mapping programs available to consumers.
GIS (Geographic Information System)
A Geographic Information System (GIS) is an information system that analyzes,
inputs, manipulates, outputs, retrieves, and stores spatial data. GIS is mostly
used by governments; large corporations; and engineering and GIS consulting
firms for land, natural resources, transportation, environmental, and urban
planning and management.
Some people use the terms digital map and GIS interchangeably. This really
isn’t correct. GIS isn’t just about making maps. GIS involves using computers
and special software to help people make decisions by using spatial data.
Distinguishing between consumer mapping programs and GIS programs is
important:
 GIS software, which is sold primarily to governments, corporations, and
consulting firms, is flexible, powerful, and relatively expensive.
 Consumer mapping programs target the needs of average computer users.
These programs are much more limited in scope and functionality — and a
lot less expensive — than GIS programs.
GIS software typically has a steep learning curve; you can earn advanced
degrees in GIS. Consumer mapping programs can mostly be used right
out of the box and can be mastered in a relatively short period of time.
A typical consumer mapping program is a road map program that costs about
$30 and provides exact routing directions to get from one location to another.
This isn’t a static map because it has underlying data (such as street names,
distances, and gas stations), which can lead you to think it’s a GIS program.
Not so. A true GIS program has built-in precision tools that can (for example)
let you input data about traffic flow and vehicle speeds, and then display every
street where traffic volume exceeds 500 cars per hour and vehicle speeds are
.5 miles an hour over the speed limit. The price tag for such a GIS program
would be at least $1,000, not to mention the costs of training people to use it
and gathering all the traffic data to input into the system.
Of course, if you have a burning need for high-end precision and complexity,
it’s still possible to get into GIS on the cheap. A growing community is develop-
ing open source and free GIS programs. Although many of these programs lack
the polish of a commercial product, they do get the job done. The http://
opensourcegis.org and www.freegis.org Web sites are two excellent
resources for finding out more about free GIS programs.

Part I: All About Digital Maps 

Using Digital Maps
There’s an old song that goes, “Anything you can do, I can do better.” If digital
maps could sing that tune to their paper counterparts, they’d be right (for the
most part). Digital mapping software offers all sorts of enhancements over
paper maps, including these capabilities:
 Finding street addresses quickly
 Interfacing with GPS receivers to see where you are or where you were
 Showing driving directions to just about anywhere
 Displaying terrain three-dimensionally
 Annotating maps with pop-up information
 Creating custom maps
 Printing a hard copy map (which is sometimes the most important)
Digital maps do have a few drawbacks, including these:
 You need a computer.
If you have a laptop or personal digital assistant (PDA), you can take
mapping software on the road with you.
 You need software.
This book helps you select and use software packages, particularly map-
ping programs in the free–$100 price range.
 You have to spend time mastering the software.
Most mapping software is readily usable, but all programs have nuances
that sometimes make their features and user interfaces a little tricky.
Mapping Software: The Essentials
The first step for digital mapping is to understand the available types of map-
ping programs and their capabilities and limitations; that’s what this part of
the book is all about.
After you know what software is available, you can match it to your needs. An
invitation to a birthday party may consist only of displaying a screen capture
of a street map on a Web site, editing and saving the map in Paint, and then
e-mailing it to friends. A week-long backpacking expedition would require a
topographic mapping program (showing land features) to plan your route,
view elevation profiles, and upload location data to your GPS receiver.
15
Chapter 1: Getting Started with Digital Maps

Before you can select the right tool for the right job, you need a general
handle on the options that you can include in your digital-mapping tool
chest. This section of the book organizes mapping programs into three 
categories:
 Standalone programs
 Programs bundled with maps
 Web-hosted mapping services
Standalone programs
A standalone program is a program that can open and use digital maps. These
programs typically don’t come with map data, and you’ll need to download
or purchase the maps you’re interested in using.
Like with a word processor or a spreadsheet, a mapping program needs some-
one to input data before it can be useful. In this case, the data is bits and
bytes that describe how a map should be displayed. Fortunately, an amazing
amount of map data is freely available on the Internet, most of it already col-
lected by the government and in the public domain.
A big market exists for commercial map data. People buy data to use with
their mapping programs because
 Free data may not be available for an area or a specific need.
 Commercial data may be enhanced with information unavailable in the
free versions.
 Firing up a CD filled with data is more convenient than searching for free
data and then downloading it.
Many standalone mapping programs aren’t tied to one data type. (Chapter 2
shows which types of digital map data are commonly used.) Figure 1-2 shows
a three-dimensional map of Mount St. Helens created with 3DEM from free U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) digital elevation map (DEM) data. (Mount St. Helens,
an active volcano in Washington State, erupted in 1980.) The elevation map
shows the crater and how the volcano blew out its side.
Map programs are viewers, editors, or both:
 Viewers show only maps.
 Editors can make changes.
Usually you can’t change a base map you’ve opened from a data file, but
you can add text and draw shapes on top of the map.
16
Part I: All About Digital Maps 

Many standalone programs are either free or shareware. Two aspects of such
programs are especially worth noting:
 Some manufacturers offer free (or cheap) limited-feature versions of their
products that are otherwise available as pricy commercial software.
 Standalone mapping programs are mostly suited to a user who has inter-
mediate to advanced computer skills and experience.
Examples of standalone mapping programs include OziExplorer (www.
oziexplorer.com), USAPhotoMaps (http://jdmcox.com), and 3DEM
(www.visualizationsoftware.com/3dem.html). Don’t forget that you 
can also make maps with Paint or any other general-purpose graphics pro-
gram. This book shows how to use these programs and others.
Some free, noncommercial mapping programs have advanced features that
are normally more suited to professional users. Don’t be intimidated by every
feature and option. You can use some commands and features to make maps
for your needs. And you can master those other features if you ever need to.
One big disadvantage to standalone mapping programs is that you need to
search the Internet for the data you need, find and download it, and then
open it with the map program. This process sometimes involves registering a
map so that the coordinates all line up. Also, even with a high-speed Internet
connection, downloading can still be a hassle. And after all that, you still have
to find the map data for an area that you want to view, and then successfully
load all that stuff into the mapping program.

17
Chapter 1: Getting Started with Digital Maps

Programs with bundled maps
Mapping companies bundle software with digital maps. The program comes
with the map data and is distributed on CDs or DVDs; static or smart maps
that have a lot of detail can be quite large in size. You install the mapping
program, and you’re immediately ready to start using the data on the CD.
Data files bundled with software are often in a proprietary file format, which
can be read and used only with the software that comes with the product.
The same usually holds true for maps that you can upload to a GPS receiver;
only maps from the manufacturer can be used.
Sometimes you don’t have much choice between using a standalone program
or one bundled with maps.
 Topographic map data of the United States is widely available for free.
You can use a number of free or shareware programs to view maps.
 Only outdated Census Bureau map data is available for United States
streets and roads. Most free or shareware programs don’t match the
features in commercial products.
Software that comes with bundled maps has gotten incredibly cheap over the
years. With discounts and rebates, you can often find road atlas software for
around $20 that covers the entire United States. For a little under $100, you can
buy programs that come with a full set of detailed digital topographic maps
for an entire state. Considering that a single paper USGS 1:24,000 map costs
around $7 — and there can easily be over a thousand maps per state — that’s
a pretty decent value. Figure 1-3 shows a map made by Terrain Navigator
(www.maptech.com/land/TerrainNavigator), which is a topographic map-
ping program that comes bundled with map data.
Manufacturers that sell bundled map programs (particularly those with
street and road data) usually come out with a new release of their product
every year or so. In addition to enhancements in the software, the map data
contains new roads and updated services information (such as gas stations,
restaurants, and hotels, called POIs, or Points of Interest). Whether you buy an
updated copy of the software every year depends on your circumstances. If
you usually travel on major roads, or in areas that haven’t experienced much
development and growth, you probably don’t need to update every year. On
the other hand, road atlas software is fairly inexpensive, so if you travel a lot
and rely on the program, it can be a cheap investment.
If you have beginning to intermediate computer skills and experience, you can
come up to speed quickly with bundled map programs. The user interfaces
are generally simpler than those found in feature-rich, standalone programs.
Examples of programs that come bundled with maps are DeLorme’s Street
Atlas USA (www.delorme.com), National Geographic’s TOPO! (http://
18
Part I: All About Digital Maps 

maps.nationalgeographic.com/topo), and mapping software from GPS
manufacturers that interfaces with their receivers. These programs and
others like them are discussed in following chapters.
Web-hosted mapping services
A Web-hosted mapping service is a Web site that displays a map. You just need
Internet access and a browser to view street maps, topographic maps, aerial
maps, satellite imagery, and many other types of maps. This eliminates pur-
chasing and installing specialized programs and map data on your hard drive,
swapping CDs to access new map data, and mastering a new program. (Figure
1-4 is a detailed street map of downtown Port Townsend, Washington, using
www.mapquest.com, a Web-hosted mapping service.)
If a map isn’t displayed, check your browser’s Java settings first. A number of
Web-hosted mapping services, in particular the U.S. government sites that all
share the same mapping engine, require Java and/or JavaScript enabled in
your browser before maps can be correctly displayed.
Most Web-hosted mapping services are extremely easy to use. Anyone who
can use an Internet browser should be navigating through maps in no time.
Examples of Web-hosted mapping services include MapQuest (www.mapquest.
com), TerraServer-USA (http://terraserver-usa.com), and TopoZone
(www.topozone.com). You discover how to use these mapping Web sites and
others in other chapters of this book.

Chapter 1: Getting Started with Digital Maps

Although most of these free Web sites don’t have all the features of a map
program that you install on your hard drive, they offer a surprising amount of
capability, especially considering their cost. (Some mapping sites on the Web
charge for advanced services, such as color aerial photographs, larger map
sizes, and enhanced searching.)

M
aps are everywhere. They tell us how to get places we want to go and
give us a better understanding of our surroundings.
Some people think that they can pick up a map and immediately start using
it. If you don’t have a lot of experience using different types of maps, that’s a
little like thinking just because you can read, you can sit down and understand
a book that’s written in French, German, or Spanish even if you’ve never had
a foreign language class in your life. Yes, you may make a little sense of the
book by picking out a few words you recognize or by looking at the pictures,
but in the process, you’re missing out on some important information.
Discovering the Types of Maps
Maps have their own language and a number of dialects depending on the type
of map. To use paper or digital maps effectively, you need at least a tourist’s
understanding of their language. The more you know, the better off you are.
That’s what this chapter is all about — different types of maps, basic map
concepts and principles, and the various kinds of digital maps that you can
access on a computer. By the end of the chapter, you’ll have a handy enough
grasp of conversational map-speak that you can ask the right questions to
avoid getting lost.

Begin by looking at the basic types of maps that you can use to navigate and
better understand your surroundings. (Although there are maps for traveling
under the ocean, visiting the moon, or zooming around in space, it’s unlikely
that you’ll need these anytime soon.)
An important point to consider is that no one universal map type does it all.
Different map types display the different features and details that are suited
for a particular use — or user. A skilled map user always selects a map that
meets his or her specific needs.
Maps are almost always oriented so the top of the map is facing north. If a
map doesn’t follow this convention, a good mapmaker places an arrow on the
map that points north.
Land
Because we spend most of our time with our feet or tires on the ground, land
maps are pretty important to know how to use. In general, the two types of
land maps are topographic and planimetric.

Anatomy of a map
Most maps have elements in common. Here are
some, along with the terms that cartographers
(mapmakers) use to describe them:
Citation: This is information about data sources
used in making the map and when the map was
made.
Collar: This is the white space that surrounds
the neatline (see the upcoming definition) and
the mapped area.
Compass rose: A map has either a simple arrow
that shows north or a full compass rose(an image
that indicates all four directions) so the user can
correctly orient the map to a compass.
Coordinates: Maps usually have either letters
and numbers or coordinates (such as latitude
and longitude values) marked along the borders
so users can locate positions on the map.
Legend: This is a box that shows an explanation
of symbols used on the map. Some maps show all
the symbols; others rely on a separate symbol
guide.
Mapped area: This is the main part of the map,
displaying the geographic area.
Neatline: This is the line that surrounds the
mapped area.
Scale: This distance-equivalence information
(such as “one inch = one mile”) helps you esti-
mate distances on a map and is typically found at
the bottom.
Title: This is usually the name of the map, but it
also tells you which area it’s mapping.

Topographic maps
Topographic maps show natural land features such as lakes, rivers, and moun-
tain peaks as well as man-made features such as roads, railroad tracks, and
canals. These maps also have contour lines that trace the outline of the terrain
and show elevation. Contour lines suggest what the land looks like in three
dimensions.
A contour interval is the distance between contour lines. For example, if a
contour interval is 20 feet, every time you go up one contour line, the eleva-
tion increases by 20 feet. Conversely, every time you go down a contour line,
the elevation decreases by 20 feet. When the contour lines are close together,
the terrain is steep. When they’re spread apart, the terrain is closer to flat.
Different maps have different contour intervals and the distance is usually
noted in the map legend.
The most popular topographic maps for use within the U.S. are made by the
United States Geological Survey (USGS). These maps cover different sizes of
area; the smaller the area, the greater the detail. Topographic maps are often
called topo maps. The topo maps that show the most detail are sometimes
called quad sheets or 7.5 minute maps because they map just one quadrangle
(geographer-speak for rectangular shaped piece of land) that covers 7.5 min-
utes of longitude and latitude. Figure 2-1, for example, is a topographic map
of The Dalles, Oregon.
A compass uses degrees to tell direction. North is 0 or 360 degrees, west is 90
degrees, south is 180 degrees, and east is 270 degrees.

graphic map

Chapter 2: Dissecting Maps

Most topographic maps show magnetic declination. Compass needles point to
magnetic north, but most maps are oriented to true north. Because the earth’s
magnetic field varies from place to place, magnetic north usually isn’t the same
as true north; in the continental United States, the difference can be as much
as 20 degrees. If you don’t account for the magnetic declination, you can get
far off-course trying to navigate someplace with a compass. The declination
tells you how many degrees you need to adjust your compass: If the declina-
tion is west, you subtract the degrees from 360 to get true north; if it’s east,
you add the degrees.
Magnetic declination changes over time, and older USGS maps can have incor-
rect declination information printed on them. Using the wrong declination
can cause all sorts of navigation problems, so check the current declination
for your area at the following Web site: www.ngdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/seg/
gmag/declination1.pl.
If your job or hobby takes you off the beaten path, you definitely need a topo-
graphic map. If you’re staying in your car, driving on paved roads, you proba-
bly don’t need a topographic map.
Planimetric maps
Planimetric maps don’t provide much information about the terrain. Lakes,
rivers, and mountain pass elevations may be shown, but there isn’t any
detailed land information. A classic example of a planimetric map is a state
highway map or a road atlas. Planimetric maps are perfect in cities or on high-
ways, but they’re not suited for backcountry use. Figure 2-2 is a planimetric
map of The Dalles, Oregon, area.

metric map

24
Part I: All About Digital Maps 

When using planimetric maps, you’ll often encounter these terms:
 Atlas: An atlas is a collection of maps, usually in a book.
 Gazetteer: A gazetteer is a geographical dictionary or a book that gives
the names and descriptions of places.
Marine
Marine charts are maps for inland, coastal, and deep-water navigation. Charts
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are com-
monly used for boating. They provide such important information as water
depth, buoy locations, channel markers, and shipping lanes. See www.noaa.
gov/charts.html for more on NOAA charts.
Marine charts aren’t available for all bodies of water. If you’re boating on a
lake or a river, you’ll probably use a topographic map for navigation.
This book focuses on land maps, so there isn’t much detail about marine
charts. Part of a marine chart of San Francisco Bay, California, is shown in
Figure 2-3.
If you’re more of a sailor than a landlubber, check out Marine Navigator at
www.maptech.com. This commercial marine-navigation program displays
NOAA charts, aerial photographs, 3-D ocean-bottom contours, and tide and
current tables.

Aeronautical
Maps designed for aviation use are charts (a term that can also refer to their
marine counterparts). These maps provide pilots with navigation information
including topographic features, major roads, railroads, cities, airports, visual
and radio aids to navigation, and other flight-related data.
You can find such aeronautical chart types as
 VFR (Visual Flight Rules)
 IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) Enroute
 Terminal Area Charts
You can find more about aeronautical charts by visiting the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) at www.
naco.faa.gov.
Figure 2-4 shows a pilot’s-eye view of the Seattle area.
FAA aviation charts aren’t freely available for download. The FAA offers a
monthly service that provides all charts and updates on DVDs for a year, 
but the cost is over $300. A number of companies such as Jeppesen
(www.jeppesen.com) and Maptech (www.maptech.com) make commercial
flight-planning software packages that include digital charts, or you can try
the www.aeroplanner.com, a Web service that provides digital charts and
other services to pilots. Another noncommercial source of FAA sectional
charts is http://aviationtoolbox.org/raw_data/FAA_sectionals.

Figuring Out Map Projections
Making a map is quite a bit more challenging than you may think. A cartogra-
pher’s first challenge is taking something that’s round like the earth (techni-
cally it’s an ellipsoid that bulges in the middle and is flat at the top and bottom)
and transforming it into something that’s flat, like a map.
Cartographers use a projection to reproduce all or part of a round body on 
a flat sheet. This is impossible without some distortion, so a cartographer
decides which characteristic (area, direction, distance, scale, or shape) is
shown accurately and which will be distorted.
Although my high-school geography teacher may smack me on the head with
a globe for saying this, the average map user doesn’t need to know what kind
of projection was used to make a map. There are some exceptions if you’re 
a cartographer or surveyor, but usually you won’t get in trouble if you don’t
know the projection. So don’t panic if you can’t immediately tell a Lambert
conformal from a Mercator or Miller projection. Just keep in mind what a pro-
jection is and that there are different types of map projections.
Map Datums
A map datum is a mathematical model that describes the shape of an 
ellipsoid — in this case, the earth. Because the shape of the earth isn’t uni-
form, over 100 datums for different parts of the earth are based on different
measurements.
Some serious math is involved here for getting into the nuts and bolts of map
datums. If you’re the scholarly type, these Web sites provide lots of details on
projections and datums:
 Datums and Projections: A Brief Guide
http://biology.usgs.gov/geotech/documents/datum.html
 Peter Dana’s excellent Geographer’s Craft site
www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/notes.html
Datums all have names, but they aren’t stuffy sounding. Datums often have
exotic, Indiana Jones-style names such as the Kerguelen Island, Djakarta, Hu-
Tzu-Shan, or Qornoq datums. (The United States uses such boring datums as
NAD 27 and WGS 84.)
27
Chapter 2: Dissecting Maps

You only need to be concerned with datums under a few circumstances, such
as these:
 A location is plotted on two different maps.
 A map and a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver are being used.
 Two different GPS receivers are being used.
In these instances, all the maps and GPS receivers must use the same datum.
If the datums are different, the location ends up in two different physical places
even though the map coordinates are exactly the same.
This is a common mistake: GPS receivers use the WGS 84 datum by default,
and USGS topographic maps use the NAD 27 datum. If you mix the datums,
your location can be off by up to 200 meters (roughly 200 yards, if you’re met-
rically challenged).
Utilities can convert coordinates from one datum to another (some are
described in Chapter 11) but it’s easier just to get all the datums on the 
same map.
Working with Map Coordinate Systems
A coordinate system is a way to locate places on a map, usually some type of
grid laid over the map. Grid systems are a whole lot easier to use and more
accurate than “take the old dirt road by the oak tree for two miles, then turn
left at the rusted tractor, and you’ll be there when the road stops getting
bumpy.”
A simple coordinate system can consist of a vertical row of letters (A, B, C)
on the left side of the map and a horizontal row of numbers (1, 2, 3) at the
bottom of the map. If you want to tell someone where the town of Biggs
Junction is (for example), you put your finger on the city and then move it in
a straight line to the left until you hit the row of letters. Then put your finger
on the city again, but this time move down until you reach the row of num-
bers. You now can say confidently that Biggs Junction is located at A12.
I call this the Battleship Grid System because it reminds me of the game where
you call out coordinates to find your opponent’s hidden aircraft carriers, sub-
marines, and destroyers. “B-3. You sank my battleship!”
A grid may be printed on the map or provide tick marks (representing 
the grid boundaries) at the map’s margins. Often maps have multiple coordi-
nate systems so you can pick one that meets your needs or that you’re 
28
Part I: All About Digital Maps 

comfortable using. For example, USGS topographic maps have latitude and
longitude, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), and township and range
marks.
Most coordinate systems are based on x and y; where x is a horizontal value,
and y is a vertical value. A location’s coordinates are expressed by drawing a
straight line down to x and across to y. Mathematician René Descartes devised
this system in the 1600s.
Letter-and-number coordinate systems are fine for highway maps, road atlases,
and other simple maps where precise locations aren’t needed. However, if you
want to focus on a precise location on a map, you need a more sophisticated
grid system. That’s where coordinate systems such as latitude and longitude
and UTM come in.
When you’re figuring out a location’s coordinates on a paper map, you have a
fair amount of work to do, aligning the location with primary tick marks and
then adding and subtracting to get the exact coordinate. With digital maps on
a computer, that’s usually just a matter of moving the cursor over a location
and watching with relief as the coordinates automatically appear. If you’re
using a paper map, you can make life easier with free overlay grids and rulers
from www.maptools.com. With these, you can print grids and rulers for dif-
ferent coordinate systems on clear transparency sheets.
Latitude/longitude
Latitude and longitude is the oldest map-coordinate system for plotting loca-
tions on the earth. The Roman scholar Ptolemy devised it almost 2,000 years
ago. Ptolemy wrote about the difficulties of accurately representing the earth
on a flat piece of paper and created latitude and longitude as a way of solving
the problem. That’s pretty impressive for a time way before computers and
satellites.
Latitude and longitude are based on a little math, but they’re not really com-
plicated. Angles are measured in degrees, and they’re used for measuring cir-
cles and spheres. Spheres can be divided into 360 degrees; because the earth
is basically a sphere, it can also be measured in degrees. This is the basis of
latitude and longitude, which use imaginary degree lines to divide the surface
of the earth (see Figure 2-5).
The equator is an imaginary circle around the earth; the circles are an equal
distance from the north and south poles and perpendicular to the earth’s
axis of rotation. The equator divides the earth into the Northern Hemisphere
(everything north of the equator) and the Southern Hemisphere (everything
south of the equator).
29
Chapter 2: Dissecting Maps

Latitude
Latitude is the angular distance measured north and south of the equator
(which represents 0 degrees of latitude).
 As you go north from the equator, the north latitude increases to 90
degrees when you arrive at the North Pole.
 As you go south of the equator, the south latitude increases to 90 degrees
at the South Pole.
In the Northern Hemisphere, the latitude is always given in degrees north; in
the southern hemisphere, it’s given in degrees south.
Longitude
Longitude works the same way as latitude, but the angular distances are mea-
sured east and west of the prime meridian (which marks the 0-degrees longitude
line that passes through Greenwich, England, without even disturbing traffic).
 When you travel east from the prime meridian, the longitude increases
to 180 degrees.
 As you go west from the prime meridian, longitude also increases to 180
degrees. (The place where the two 180-degree longitudes meet is known
as the International Date Line.)
 In the Eastern Hemisphere (which is east of the prime meridian to 180
degrees east), the longitude is given in degrees east.
 In the Western Hemisphere (which is west of the prime meridian to 180
degrees west), longitude is expressed in degrees west.
One degree is actually a pretty big unit of measure. One degree of latitude or
longitude is roughly equal to 70 miles.
Degrees are composed of smaller, fractional amounts that sound like you’re
telling time.
Figure 2-5:
Latitude and
longitude
are imag-
inary lines
that provide
a location
reference.
30
Part I: All About Digital Maps 

 Degree: A degree comprises 60 minutes.
One minute is about 1.2 miles.
 Minute: A minute is composed of 60 seconds.
One second is around .02 miles.
These measurement units are abbreviated with the following symbols:
 Degree: °
 Minute: '
 Second: "
If you use minutes and seconds in conjunction with degrees, you can
describe a very accurate location.
These distances are measured at the equator. At higher latitudes, the distance
between longitude units decreases. The distance between latitude degrees is
the same everywhere.
If you are using latitude and longitude to locate Dillon Falls on a map of the
Deschutes River in Oregon, its coordinates are
43° 57' 29.79" N 121° 24' 34.73" W
31
Chapter 2: Dissecting Maps
Too much latitude
Latitude and longitude are pretty straightforward
and logical if you think about it. Unfortunately,
over the years, people have muddied things a
bit by inventing different ways to represent lat-
itude and longitude coordinates.
Latitude and longitude coordinates can be writ-
ten as
 Degrees, minutes, and seconds: This is the
traditional way, with my example of Dillon
Falls expressed as 43° 57' 29.79" N 121° 24'
34.73" W.
 Degrees and decimal minutes: Seconds are
dropped, and the decimal version of minutes
is used along with degrees, so now the falls
are at 43° 57.4965' N 121° 24.5788' W.
 Decimal degrees: Minutes and seconds are
both dropped, and only the decimal repre-
sentation of degrees is used, which puts the
falls at 43.9582750° N 121.4096490° W.
Remember: Although they look different, all these
coordinate notations still point to the same loca-
tion. The math is pretty straightforward if you
want to convert the coordinates from one format
to another. If you want to save time, point your
Web browser to http://nris.state.mt.
us/wis/location/latlong.asp where
the friendly people at the Montana State Library
have a handy conversion calculator online.

That means that Dillon Falls is
 41 degrees, 57 minutes, and 29.76 seconds north of the equator
 121 degrees, 24 minutes, 34.73 seconds west of the prime meridian
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
Universal Transverse Mercator is a modern coordinate system developed in
the 1940s. It’s similar to latitude and longitude, but it uses meters instead of
degrees, minutes, and seconds. UTM coordinates are very accurate, and the
system is pretty easy to use and understand.
Although the United States hasn’t moved to the metric system, the system is
widely used by GPS receivers. UTM coordinates are much easier than latitude
and longitude to plot on maps. The two key values to convert metric measure-
ments are
 1 meter = 3.28 feet = 1.09 yards.
For ballpark measurements, a meter is a bit over a yard.
 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters = 3,280 feet = 1,094 yards = 0.62 miles.
For ballpark measurements, a kilometer is a bit more than half a mile.
32
Part I: All About Digital Maps 
Specialized coordinate systems
Here are a few other coordinate systems so you
know what they are:
MGRS (Military Grid Reference System): A coor-
dinate system used by the U.S. and NATO military
forces. It’s an extension of the UTM system. It
further divides the UTM zones into 100-kilometer
squares labeled with the letters A–Z.
State Plane Coordinate System: A coordinate
system used in the United States. Each state is
divided into at least one State Plane zone. Similar
to the UTM system, it uses feet instead of meters.
Proprietary grids: Anyone can invent a coordi-
nate system for finding locations on a map.
Examples of proprietary systems are ZIP code,
the Maidenhead Locator System (a grid system
for amateur radio operators) and Thomas
Brothers street guides (that match a location
with a page number and grid).
Most coordinate systems try to make navigation
and surveying more accurate and simpler.
GPS is sending less-used coordinate systems the
way of the dinosaur because you can quickly
and easily get precise location positions in either
UTM coordinates or latitude and longitude with
an inexpensive GPS receiver.

The UTM system is based on the simple A, B, C/1, 2, 3 coordinate system. The
world is divided into zones:
 Sixty primary zones run north and south.
Numbers identify the zones that run north and south.
 Twenty optional zones run east to west.
These zones indicate whether a coordinate is in the Northern or
Southern Hemisphere.
Letters designate the east/west zones.
Often the letter is dropped from a UTM coordinate, and only the zone is used
to make things simpler. For example, because most of Florida is in Zone 17 R,
if you were plotting locations in that state, you could just use Zone 17 in your
UTM coordinates. Figure 2-6 shows its UTM zone map.
To provide a precise location, UTM uses two units:
 Easting: The distance in meters to the east from the start of a UTM
zone line
The letter E follows Easting values.
 Northing: The distance in meters from the equator
The letter N follows Northing values.
There’s no such thing as a Southing. Northing is used in the Southern
Hemisphere to describe the distance away from the equator, even though
a location is south of the Equator. (Is that weird, or what?)
Figure 2-6:
The UTM
zone map
for the
world.
33
Chapter 2: Dissecting Maps

Continuing with my example of Dillon Falls, if you use UTM to locate the falls,
the coordinates look like this:
10T 0627598E 4868251N
That means that the falls are in Zone 10T, which is 4,868,251 meters north of
the equator and 627,598 meters east of where the zone line starts. (For those
of you without a calculator in front of you, that’s about 3,025 miles north of
the equator, and about 390 miles east of where the number 10 Zone line starts
out in the Pacific Ocean.)
Township and Range
The Township and Range coordinate system has been used since the 1790s to
survey public lands in the United States. Technically, the official name of this
system is the Public Land Rectangular Survey (PLS), but in practical use, most
people call it Township and Range.
This coordinate system was developed after the American Revolution as a
way to survey and grant title to land that was newly acquired following the
country’s independence. Thomas Jefferson helped develop the system, which
was enacted under the Northwest Land Ordinance of 1785. Township and
Range isn’t used in the eastern United States (or in a few other states)
because land surveys in those states had been completed.
The system is based on the following components, which are shown in
Figure 2-7:
 Meridians and baselines. These lines are the foundation of the
Township and Range system:
• Meridians are imaginary lines that run north to south.
• Baselines are lines that run east to west.
• An initial point is where a meridian and a baseline meet.
The California Bureau of Land Management has a nice online map of all
the meridians and baselines at www.ca.blm.gov/pa/cadastral/
meridian.html.
 Townships: Townships are the horizontal part of the coordinate 
system.
• Each township is six square miles in size.
• Townships are identified by whole numbers starting with 1.
34
Part I: All About Digital Maps 

• The first township at the intersection of a meridian and baseline is
1, the next township is 2, and so on.
• If a township is north of the baseline, it’s identified with an N; if it’s
south of the baseline, it’s designated with an S. For example, the
fifth township north of a meridian and baseline is T. 5 N.
 Ranges: Ranges are the vertical part of the grid scale.
• Ranges are six miles wide.
• Ranges are numbered starting at the intersection of the meridian
and the baseline.
• In addition to a number, a range is identified as being east or west
of a meridian. For example, the third range west of the meridian
and baseline is R. 3 W.
The intersection of a township and range (a 36-square mile parcel of land) also
is also called a township. This bit of semantics shouldn’t have an effect on
you using the coordinate system, but watch out for someone else doing this.
Like other coordinate systems, Township and Range uses smaller measure-
ment units to identify a precise location. These units include
 Sections: A 36-square-mile township is further divided into 36 one-mile
squares called sections.
Sections are numbered 1–36. Number 1 starts in the top, right of the
township, and the numbers sequentially snake back and forth across
the section, ending at number 36 in the bottom-right corner.
 Quarters: Sections are divided even further by slicing them into quarters.
• Quarters are identified by the part of the section they occupy, such
as northwest, northeast, southwest, or southeast.
• You can further narrow the location with quarter quarters or quarter
quarter-quarters.

Chapter 2: Dissecting Maps

Township and Range coordinates are a hodgepodge of abbreviations and
numbers that lack the mathematical precision of latitude and longitude or
UTM. For example, the Township and Range coordinates of Dillon Falls are
SE 1/4 of SW 1/4 of NE 1/4, Sect. 4, T. 19 S, R. 11 E, Willamette Meridian
To describe a location with this coordinate system, you start from the small-
est chunk of land and then work your way up to larger chunks. Some people
ignore this convention and reverse the order, skip the meridian, or use both
halves and quarters. (Hey, it keeps life interesting. . . .)
Although scanned paper maps (such as USGS topographic maps) often show
township and range information, most digital mapping software and GPS
receivers don’t support township and range. This is good news because 
latitude and longitude and UTM are much easier to use.
Township and range information usually is omitted from digital maps because
 The coordinate system is difficult to mathematically model.
 Townships and sections may be oddly shaped because of previously
granted lands, surveying errors, and adjustments for the curvature of
the earth.
Peter Dana’s comprehensive Geographer’s Craft Web site has lots of good
technical information on coordinate systems:
www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/coordsys/coordsys.html
Measuring Map Scales
Most maps have a scale — the ratio of the horizontal distance on the map to
the corresponding horizontal distance on the ground. For example, one inch
on a map can represent one mile on the ground.
The map scale is usually shown at the bottom of the map in the legend.
Often, rulers with the scale mark specific distances for you. A scale from a
USGS topographic map is shown in Figure 2-8.
Many maps use a representative fraction to describe scale. This is the ratio of
the map distance to the ground distance in the same units of measure. For
example, a map that’s 1:24,000 scale means that one inch measured on the
map is equivalent to 24,000 inches on the ground. The number can be inches,
feet, millimeters, centimeters, or some other unit of measure.
The units on the top and bottom of the representative fraction must be the
same. You can’t mix measurement units.
36
Part I: All About Digital Maps 

When you’re dealing with scale, keep these guidelines in mind:
 The smaller the number to the right of the 1, the more detail the 
map has.
A 1:24,000 map has much more detail than a 1:100,000 scale map. A
1:24,000 map is a large-scale map, showing a small area.
 The smaller the number to the right of the 1, the smaller the area the
map displays.
In Figure 2-9, the 1:100,000 scale map shows a much larger area than the
1:24,000 scale map. A 1:100,000 map is a small-scale map, showing a
large area.
All sorts of rulers and measurement tools are calibrated to scale for measur-
ing distance on paper maps. Mapping software makes distances easier and
quicker to determine by offering tools that draw a line between two points
and show an exact distance.

Chapter 2: Dissecting Maps

Looking at Map Symbols
Symbols — icons, lines, and colored shading, as well as circles, squares, and
other shapes — are important parts of a map’s language. They give the map a
more detailed meaning without cluttering up the picture with too many words.
They represent roads, rivers, railroads, buildings, cities, and just about any
natural or man-made feature you can think of. Symbols are either shown on
the map or are compiled in a separate map symbol guide. Some common
symbols found on USGS topographic maps are shown in Figure 2-10.
Whether you’re using a paper or a digital map, always familiarize yourself with
its symbols. The more symbols you know, the better decisions you make when
you’re relying on a map for navigation.
Map symbols aren’t universal. A symbol can have different meanings on dif-
ferent maps. For example, the symbol for a secondary highway on a USGS
topographic map is a railroad on a Swiss map.
These Web sites show what symbols for different types of maps mean:

Digital Map Data
Here I concentrate on digital map data that the U.S. government makes avail-
able for free. You can make your own maps with this data by using freeware
and shareware mapping programs discussed in other chapters of this book.
Although other countries use the same or similar data formats as the U.S. gov-
ernment for producing digital maps, trying to obtain detailed international map
data can be difficult. In some parts of the world, maps and map data are tightly
controlled by the government because they’re are considered a key part of a
country’s national security. Chapter 22 lists a number of Internet resources
where you can get maps and map data for areas outside the United States.
TIGER
The U.S. Census Bureau produces Topologically Integrated Geographic
Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) data for compiling maps with demo-
graphic information. This vector data is a primary source for creating digital
road maps of the United States. Figure 2-11 shows a map of downtown San
Francisco created from Census Bureau TIGER data.
TIGER data is free (check out the Census Bureau Web site at www.census.gov/
geo/www/tiger/index.html) but in some areas isn’t very accurate; roads
don’t appear on the map and addresses aren’t in the right locations. The gov-
ernment is improving the accuracy of the dataset, and plans to provide better
data in the future. You’re better off using some of the free and commercial
street map programs and Web sites discussed in Chapters 12 and 18.

Digital Line Graph (DLG)
Digital Line Graph (DLG) data from the USGS is used to create vector maps.
The data includes transportation networks, hydrography (measuring surface
waters), boundaries, elevation contours, and man-made features. The format
is similar to TIGER data but generally has more accurate roads and other
features.

Mapmaker, mapmaker, make me a map
Data for digital maps comes from government
sources and commercial mapmaking companies,
which license their maps to other companies.
These entities get data from satellites, aerial pho-
tographs, existing maps, or sometimes from folks
driving and walking around with a GPS receiver,
using a laptop to record data. As an example,
here are the main providers of digital map data
for the United States. (Most countries will have
a similar collection of government agencies and
commercial sources that produce map data.)
 USGS: The United States Geological Survey
(USGS) has been making United States land
maps since 1879.

 Census Bureau: The Census Bureau is in
the map-making business because the data
it collects is directly tied to location. Its Web
site has information on its TIGER data.

 States, counties, and cities: States, coun-
ties, and larger cities have Geographic
Information System (GIS) divisions that pro-
duce maps. This data is often available to the

Chapter 2: Dissecting Maps
Raster and vector maps
These two terms describe the underlying format
of a digital map:
Raster maps are composed of a series of pixels
(picture elements) aligned in a grid. Each pixel
(or bit) contains information about the color to
be displayed or printed. Because bitmap images
can be very large, graphics formats such as GIF
(Graphic Interchange Format) and TIFF (Tag
Image File Format) use compression to make
images smaller. An example of a raster map is a
paper map that’s been scanned and saved as
graphic file.
Raster maps tend to show more detail than vector
maps and don’t look as computer-generated.
Figure 2-1 is a raster map.
Vector maps are composed of many individual
objects. The objects are mathematically based.
They can be points, lines, and shapes. Each
object has properties that define its appearance
and attributes, such as color, thickness, and style.
If you’ve used such graphics software as Adobe
Illustrator or CorelDRAW (called object-oriented
drawing programs), you’ve used a vector graph-
ics program. A map can contain thousands of
these objects, but vector maps tend to be smaller
than raster maps because it’s more efficient to
mathematically describe an object than draw it
as a bitmap. Vector maps are scalable, which
means you can resize a vector map without dis-
torting the map’s information. Vector maps
appear to be created with lines and shapes and
are linear looking. Figure 2-2 is a vector map.

Elevation data
You’re likeliest to run into one of these two main data formats used to repre-
sent elevation:
 Digital Elevation Model (DEM): The USGS uses this raster data format to
record elevation information (based on topographic maps) and create
three-dimensional representations of the terrain. Figure 2-13 shows a
map of Mt. Bachelor, Oregon, generated from Digital Elevation Model
data with the 3DEM mapping program.
 National Elevation Dataset (NED): This format shows digital elevation
data in shaded relief. It’s designed for seamless coverage of the United
States in large raster files.
Digital Raster Graphics (DRG)
Digital Raster Graphics (DRG) data is a scanned image of a USGS topographic
map. These digital maps are available for free on the Internet or are sold com-
mercially in collections on CDs or DVDs. Figure 2-14 shows a DRG map from
the TerraServer-USA Web server. This map is a digital version of a 1:24,000
scale topographic map.
These digital maps are scanned at 250 dpi (dots per inch) and stored in a
TIFF file format, using embedded GeoTIFF (geographic information) tags for
location data.

You can view the map by itself or both the map and its location data. Use one
of the following methods:
 View the map by opening the DRG file with any current graphics program
that supports large TIFF files.
 Use the DRG file with a mapping program that supports GeoTIFF to view
the map and access its location data.

Who is Mr. Sid?
This question is more accurately stated as what
is MrSID? MrSID is the Multi-Resolution Seam-
less Image Database. It’s a file format used for
distributing large images over networks, origi-
nally developed by a company called LizardTech.
Graphics in MrSID format are compressed with
a lossless compression algorithm (a method of
compressing data that guarantees the original
data can be restored exactly) designed to pro-
duce relatively small, high-resolution images.
The file format is perfect for aerial and satellite
images that have large file sizes, and the govern-
ment is increasingly using it for distributing data.
(The Library of Congress is even using it for elec-
tronic versions of paper documents.) A number
of free viewers support MrSID; use Google to find
download sites. (One of my favorites is IrfanView,
which is available at www.irfanview.com.)

Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle (DOQ)
Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle (DOQ) data consists of a computer-generated
image of an aerial photograph. The image is corrected so that camera tilt and
terrain relief don’t affect the accuracy. DOQs combine the image characteris-
tics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Figure 2-15 shows
a DOQ map of Mt. Bachelor, Oregon, from the TerraServer-USA Web site.
The USGS has DOQs available for the entire United States. Most are grayscale,
infrared photos; there are higher-resolution color photos for a few large U.S.
metropolitan areas.
A booming business provides high-resolution, color aerial photographs to
individuals, government agencies, corporations, and educational and non-
profit organizations. Companies like AirphotoUSA (www.airphotousa.com),
Keyhole (www.keyhole.com) and DeLorme’s TopoBird subsidiary (www.
topobird.com) provide imagery with quality and resolution that’s close to
what was only available to intelligence agencies. If you want aerial photographs
for business or government purposes, check these commercial sources.
Satellite data
Satellites are the most exotic source of data for digital maps. Orbiting several
hundred miles above the earth, satellites provide photographs and other
sensor data. NASA’s Landsat, the Space Shuttle, and other satellites collect
raster data for most of the earth. It’s available both free and commercially.

Resolution defines the smallest object a satellite can distinguish. A satellite
with one-meter resolution can distinguish objects down to a meter (a little
under 40 inches) in size.
Figure 2-16 is a ten-meter resolution SPOT satellite data of Mt. Bachelor, from
DeLorme’s Spot 10 collection of satellite data. (SPOT, which stands for Systeme
Pour l’observation de la Terre, is a French commercial satellite program that
started in 1986.)
Although most free satellite imagery doesn’t come close to the resolution of
some commercial sources, the government is relying increasingly on private
companies to acquire data. I expect that government sources eventually will
release high-resolution, color imagery to the public.

The highest resolution commercial satellite
imagery available is .61 meters, from Digital-
Globe’s QuickBird satellite (www.digital
globe.com). 
By 2006, commercial satellites are expected to
have resolution as high as 0.25 meters. That’s
pretty close to the resolution of spy satellites,
which are thought to have a resolution of 0.1
meters. (The best spy satellites can reputedly
discern objects about the size of a baseball.
Despite what you see in the movies, license
plate numbers are too small to be read by spy
satellites, especially considering they don’t face
up toward space.)

 Understanding GPS capabilities and limitations
 Types of information you can get from a GPS receiver
 Getting familiar with common GPS receiver features
 Looking into the future of GPS
You’ve heard about GPS and probably know that it has something to do
with handheld gadgets and satellites that tell you where you’re located.
That’s great for starters, but to understand and use GPS, you need a bit more
detailed knowledge. Follow this chapter to go through some of the fundamen-
tals of GPS so you have a better grasp of what it is and how you can use it.
What Is GPS?
GPS stands for Global Positioning System. A special radio receiver measures
the distance from your location to satellites that orbit the earth broadcasting
radio signals. GPS can pinpoint your position anywhere in the world. Pretty
cool, huh? Aside from buying the receiver, the system is free for anyone.
You can purchase an inexpensive GPS receiver, pop some batteries in it, turn
it on, and presto! Your location appears on the screen. No map, compass, sex-
tant, nor sundial is required. Just like magic. It’s not really magic, though, but
has evolved from some great practical applications of science that have come
together over the last 50 years.
Other satellite Global Positioning Systems are either in orbit or planned, but
this book uses the term GPS for the Global Positioning System operated by
the United States government.

How GPS Works
The intricacies of GPS are steeped in mathematics, physics, and engineering,
but you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to understand how GPS works.
GPS is composed of three parts (as shown in Figure 3-1):
50
Part II: All About GPS 
A short history of GPS
Military, government, and civilian users all over
the world rely on GPS for navigation and location
positioning, but radio signals have been used
for navigation purposes since the 1920s. LORAN
(Long Range Aid to Navigation), a position-finding
system that measured the time difference of
arriving radio signals, was developed during
World War II.
The first step to GPS came way back in 1957
when the Russians launched Sputnik, the first
satellite to orbit the Earth. Sputnik used a radio
transmitter to broadcast telemetry information.
Scientists at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics
Lab discovered that the Doppler shift phenome-
non applied to the spacecraft — and almost
unwittingly struck gold.
A down-to-earth, painless example of the
Doppler shift principle is when you stand on a
sidewalk and a police car speeds by in hot pur-
suit of a stolen motorcycle. The pitch of the police
siren increases as the car approaches you and
then drops sharply as it moves away.
American scientists figured out that if they knew
the satellite’s precise orbital position, they could
accurately locate their exact position on Earth by
listening to the pinging sounds and measuring
the satellite’s radio signal Doppler shift. Satellites
offered some possibilities for a navigation and
positioning system, and the U.S. Department of
Defense (DoD) explored the concept.
By the 1960s, several rudimentary satellite-
positioning systems existed. The U.S. Army,
Navy, and Air Force were all working on inde-
pendent versions of radio navigation systems
that could provide accurate positioning and all-
weather, 24-hour coverage. In 1973, the Air Force
was selected as the lead organization to consol-
idate all the military satellite navigation efforts
into a single program. This evolved into the
NAVSTAR (Navigation Satellite Timing and
Ranging) Global Positioning System, which is the
official name for the United States’ GPS program.
The U.S. military wasn’t just interested in GPS for
navigation. A satellite location system can be
used for weapons-system targeting. Smart
weapons such as the Tomahawk cruise missile
use GPS in their precision guidance systems.
GPS, combined with contour-matching radar 
and digital image-matching optics, makes a
Tomahawk an extremely accurate weapon. The
possibility of an enemy using GPS against the
United States is one reason why civilian GPS
receivers are less accurate than their restricted-
use military counterparts.
The first NAVSTAR satellite was launched in 1974
to test the concept. By the mid-1980s, more satel-
lites were put in orbit to make the system func-
tional. In 1994, the planned full constellation of
24 satellites was in place. Soon, the military
declared the system completely operational.
The program has been wildly successful and is
still funded through the U.S. DoD.

 Satellites
 Ground stations
 Receivers
Eyeing satellites
In GPS jargon, a satellite is the space segment. A constellation of 24 GPS satel-
lites (21 operational and 3 spares) orbits about 12,000 miles above the Earth
(as shown in Figure 3-2). The satellites zoom through the heavens at around
7,000 miles per hour. It takes about 12 hours for a satellite to completely orbit
the Earth, passing over the exact same spot approximately every 24 hours.
The satellites are positioned where a GPS receiver can receive signals from at
least six of the satellites at any time, at any location on the Earth (if nothing
obstructs the signals).
A satellite has three key pieces of hardware:
 Computer: This onboard computer controls its flight and other 
functions.
 Atomic clock: This keeps accurate time within three nanoseconds
(around three-billionths of a second).
 Radio transmitter: This sends signals to Earth.

Chapter 3: GPS Fundamentals

GPS satellites don’t just help you stay found. All GPS satellites since 1980
carry NUDET sensors. No, this isn’t some high-tech pornography-detection
system. NUDET is an acronym for NUclear DETonation; GPS satellites have
sensors to detect nuclear-weapon explosions, assess the threat of nuclear
attack, and help evaluate nuclear strike damage.
The solar-powered GPS satellites have a limited life span (around 10 years).
When they start to fail, spares are activated or new satellites are sent into
orbit to replace the old ones. This gives the government a chance to upgrade
the GPS system by putting hardware with new features into space.
GPS radio signals
GPS satellites transmit two types of radio signals: C/A-code and P-code.
Briefly, here are the uses and differences of these two types of signals.
Coarse Acquisition (C/A-code)
Coarse Acquisition (C/A-code) is the type of signal that consumer GPS units
receive. C/A-code is sent on the L1 band at a frequency of 1575.42 MHz.
C/A broadcasts are known as the Standard Positioning Service (SPS).
C/A-code is less accurate than P-code (see the following section) and is easier
for U.S. military forces to jam and spoof (broadcast false signals to make a
receiver think it’s somewhere else when it’s really not).
The advantage of C/A-code is that it’s quicker to use for acquiring satellites
and getting an initial position fix. Some military P-code receivers first track
on the C/A-code and then switch over to P-code.

lation of

satellites

52
Part II: All About GPS 

Precision (P-code)
P-code provides highly precise location information. P-code is difficult to jam
and spoof. The U.S. military is the primary user of P-code transmissions, and
it uses an encrypted form of the data (Y-code) so only special receivers can
access the information. The P-code signal is broadcast on the L2 band at
1227.6 MHz.
P-code broadcasts are known as the Precise Positioning Service (PPS).
Covering ground stations
Ground stations are the control segment of GPS. Five unmanned ground 
stations around the Earth monitor the satellites. Information from the 
stations is sent to a master control station — the Consolidated Space
Operations Center (CSOC) at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado — where
the data is processed to determine each satellite’s ephemeris and timing
errors.
An ephemeris is a list of the predicted positions of astronomical bodies such
as the planets or the Moon. Ephemerides (the plural of ephemeris) have been
around for thousands of years because of their importance in celestial navi-
gation. Ephemerides are compiled to track the positions of the numerous
satellites orbiting the earth.
The processed data is sent to the satellites once daily with ground antennas
located around the world. This is kind of like syncing a personal digital assis-
tant (PDA) with your personal computer to ensure that all the data is in sync
between the two devices. Because the satellites have small built-in rockets,
the CSOC can control them to ensure that they stay in a correct orbit.
GPS receivers
Anyone who has a GPS receiver can receive the satellite signals to determine
where he or she is located.
Satellite data
GPS units receive two types of data from the NAVSTAR satellites.
Almanac
Almanac data contains the approximate positions of the satellites. The data is
constantly being transmitted and is stored in the GPS receiver’s memory.
53
Chapter 3: GPS Fundamentals

Ephemeris
Ephemeris data has the precise positions of the satellites. To get an accurate
location fix, the receiver has to know how far away a satellite is. The GPS
receiver calculates the distance to the satellite by using signals from the
satellite.
Using the formula Distance = Velocity x Time, a GPS receiver calculates the
satellite’s distance. A radio signal travels at the speed of light (186,000 miles
per second). The GPS receiver needs to know how long the radio signal takes
to travel from the satellite to the receiver in order to figure the distance. Both
the satellite and the GPS receiver generate an identical pseudo-random code
sequence. When the GPS receiver receives this transmitted code, it determines
how much the code needs to be shifted (using the Doppler-shift principle) for
the two code sequences to match. The shift is multiplied by the speed of light
to determine the distance from the satellite to the receiver.
Multiple satellites
A GPS receiver needs several pieces of data to produce position information:
 Location: A minimum of three satellite signals is required to find your
location.
 Position: Four satellite signals are required to determine your position
in three dimensions: latitude, longitude, and elevation.
Receiver types
GPS receivers generally fall into five categories.
Consumer models
Consumers can buy practical GPS receivers in sporting goods stores. They’re
easy to use and are mostly targeted for recreational and other uses that
don’t require a high level of location precision. The Big Three manufacturers
in the consumer GPS market are Garmin (www.garmin.com), Magellan (www.
magellangps.com), and Lowrance (www.lowrance.com). Consumer GPS
receivers are reasonably priced, from less than $100 to $400 in the U.S.
This book emphasizes the features of and how to use the consumer-oriented,
handheld types.
When you buy a consumer receiver, opt for a 12-channel GPS model over an
older 8-channel model:
 12-channel parallel receivers: These acquire satellites faster and oper-
ate better under foliage and tree-canopy cover.
 8-channel receivers: These are slow when acquiring satellite signals and
have difficulty operating even under light tree cover.
54
Part II: All About GPS 

Don’t consider purchasing an 8-channel receiver. Even if you were given one
for free, it’s like running the latest version of Windows on a 386 computer.
U.S. military/government models
GPS units that receive P-code and Y-code are available only to the government.
These portable units are Precision Lightweight GPS Receivers (PLGRs — or,
more fondly, pluggers). First-generation PLGRs were big and boxy and provided
accuracy within four meters. The newest precise GPS receivers are DAGRs
(Defense Advanced Global Positioning System Receivers) and are smaller, more
accurate, and have mapping features like consumer GPS units. For the specifi-
cations of U.S. military GPS receivers, including pictures of different units, visit
http://army-gps.robins.af.mil.
Mapping/resource models
These portable receivers collect location points and line and area data that can
be input into a Geographic Information System (GIS). They are more precise
than consumer models, can store more data, and are much more expensive.
Survey models
These are used mostly for surveying land, where you may need accuracy
down to the centimeter for legal or practical purposes. These units are
extremely precise and store a large amount of data. They tend to be large,
complex to use, and very expensive.
55
Chapter 3: GPS Fundamentals
Selective Availability (SA)
The average GPS user didn’t always have 15-
meter accuracy. In the 1970s, studies showed
that the less-accurate C/A-code for nonmilitary
use, was more accurate than the U.S. govern-
ment intended. Originally thought to provide
accuracy within 100 meters, experiments showed
that C/A accuracy was in the range of 20–30
meters. To reduce the accuracy of C/A-code, the
U.S. government developed Selective Availability
(SA). SA adds errors to NAVSTAR satellite data
and prevents consumer GPS receivers from pro-
viding an extremely precise location fix.
Selective Availability was temporarily turned off
in 1990 during the Persian Gulf War. There
weren’t enough U.S. and allies military P-code
GPS receivers, so the Coalition troops used civil-
ian GPS receivers. The Gulf War was the first
use of GPS in large-scale combat operations.
On May 2, 2000, SA was turned off permanently.
Overnight, the accuracy of civilian GPS users
went from 100 meters to 15 meters. Turning off SA
on a global scale was directly related to the U.S.
military’s ability to degrade the C/A-code on a
regional basis. For example, during the invasion
of Afghanistan, the American military jammed
GPS signals in Afghanistan to prevent the
Taliban from using consumer receivers in oper-
ations against American forces.

Commercial transportation models
These GPS receivers, not designed to be handheld, are installed in aircraft,
ships, boats, trucks, and cars. They provide navigation information appropri-
ate to the mode of transportation. These receivers may be part of an
Automated Position Reporting System (APRS) that sends the vehicle’s loca-
tion to a monitoring facility.
Trimble Navigation (www.trimble.com) is one of the biggest players in the
nonconsumer GPS receiver market. If you’re interested in discovering how
commercial and higher-end GPS units work and the features they support,
check out the Trimble Web site.
How accurate is a GPS receiver?
According to the government and GPS receiver manufacturers, expect your
GPS unit to be accurate within 49 feet (that’s 15 meters for metric-savvy
folks). If your GPS reports that you’re at a certain location, you can be rea-
sonably sure that you’re within 49 feet of that exact set of coordinates.
GPS receivers tell you how accurate your position is. Based on the quality of
the satellite signals that the unit receives, the screen displays the estimated
accuracy in feet or meters. Accuracy depends on
 Receiver location
 Obstructions that block satellite signals
Even if you’re not a U.S. government or military GPS user, you can get more
accuracy by using a GPS receiver that supports corrected location data.
Corrected information is broadcast over radio signals that come from either
 Non-GPS satellites
 Ground-based beacons
Two common sources of more accurate location data are
 Differential GPS (DGPS)
 Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)
I cover both DGPS and WAAS in the following section on GPS receiver features.
Table 3-1 shows the accuracy you can expect from a GPS receiver. These
numbers are guidelines; at times, you may get slightly more or less accuracy.

Chapter 3: GPS Fundamentals
GPS errors
A number of conditions can reduce the accuracy
of a GPS receiver. From a top-down perspective
(from orbit down to ground level), the possible
sources of trouble look like this:
 Ephemeris errors: Ephemeris errors occur
when the satellite doesn’t correctly trans-
mit its exact position in orbit.
 Ionosphere conditions: The ionosphere
starts at about 43–50 miles above the Earth
and continues for hundreds of miles. Satellite
signals traveling through the ionosphere
are slowed down because of plasma (a low
density gas). Although GPS receivers attempt
account for this delay, unexpected plasma
activity can cause calculation errors.
 Troposphere conditions: The troposphere is
the lowest region in the Earth’s atmosphere
and goes from ground level up to about 11
miles. Variations in temperature, pressure,
and humidity all can cause variations in how
fast radio waves travel, resulting in relatively
small accuracy errors.
 Timing errors: Because placing an atomic
clock in every GPS receiver is impractical,
timing errors from the receiver’s less-precise
clock can cause slight position inaccuracies.
 Multipath errors: When a satellite signal
bounces off a hard surface (such as a build-
ing or canyon wall) before it reaches the
receiver, a delay in the travel time occurs,
which causes an inaccurate distance cal-
culation.
 Poor satellite coverage: When a significant
part of the sky is blocked, your GPS unit has
difficulty receiving satellite data. Unfortu-
nately, you can’t say that if 50 percent (or
some other percentage) of the sky is blocked,
you’ll have poor satellite reception; this is
because the GPS satellites are constantly
moving in orbit. A satellite that provides a
good signal one day may provide a poor
signal at the exact same location on another
day because its position has changed and
is now being blocked by a tree. The more
open sky you have, the better your chances
of not having satellite signals blocked.
Building interiors, streets surrounded by tall
buildings, dense tree canopies, canyons,
and mountainous areas are typical problem
areas.
If satellite coverage is poor, try moving to a dif-
ferent location to see whether you get any
improvement.

Although survey-grade GPS receivers can provide accuracy of less than two
centimeters, they are very specialized and expensive, require a lot of training,
and aren’t very portable. Their accuracy is achieved with DGPS and post-
processing collected data to reduce location errors. The average GPS user
doesn’t need this level of precision.
Clouds, rain, snow, and weather don’t reduce the strength of GPS signals
enough to reduce accuracy. The only way that weather can weaken signals is
when a significant amount of rain or snow accumulates on the GPS receiver
antenna or on an overhead tree canopy.
Information from GPS Receivers
GPS receivers provide your location and other useful information:
 Time: A GPS receiver receives time information from atomic clocks, so
it’s much more accurate than your wristwatch.
 Location: GPS provides your location in three dimensions:
• Latitude (x coordinate)
• Longitude (y coordinate)
• Elevation
The vertical (elevation) accuracy of consumer GPS receivers isn’t
that great. It can be within 15 meters, 95 percent of time. Some GPS
units incorporate more accurate barometric altimeters for better
elevation information.
Your location can be displayed in a number of coordinate systems, such as
• Latitude/longitude
• Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
I cover coordinate systems in Chapter 2.
 Speed: When you’re moving, a GPS receiver displays your speed.
 Direction of travel: A GPS receiver can display your direction of travel if
you’re moving.
If you’re stationary, the unit can’t use satellite signals to determine
which direction you’re facing.
Some GPS units have electronic compasses that show the direction the
receiver is pointed whether you’re moving or standing still.
 Stored locations: You can store locations where you’ve been or want to
go with a GPS receiver. These location positions are waypoints. Waypoints
are important because a GPS unit can supply you with directions and
information on how to get to a waypoint. A collection of waypoints that
58
Part II: All About GPS 

plots a course of travel is a route, which can also be stored. GPS receivers
also store tracks (which are like an electronic collection of breadcrumb
trails that show where you’re been).
In Chapter 4, I show how to create and use waypoints, routes, and tracks.
 Cumulative data: A GPS receiver can also keep track of information such
as the total distance traveled, average speed, maximum speed, minimum
speed, elapsed time, and time to arrival at a specified location.
All this information is displayed on different pages of the GPS receiver’s dis-
play screen. One page shows satellite status, another page displays a map,
another displays trip data, and so on. With buttons on the receiver, you can
scroll to an information page to view the data that you’re interested in seeing.
GPS Receiver Features
A number of GPS receivers are on the market. Usually a GPS receiver with
more features costs more.
GPS manufacturers have done a pretty good job making user interfaces easy
to use. After you know the basic concepts of GPS receivers and are familiar
with a manufacturer’s user interface, a GPS unit is usually as easy to use as a
cellphone and easier to use than a personal computer.
Display and output
GPS receivers have three choices for information display or data output:
 Monochrome LCD screen: Most GPS receivers have a monochrome
liquid crystal display (LCD) screen.
 Color screen: These are especially useful for displaying maps.
Color screens usually have shorter battery lives than monochrome ones.
 No screen: Some GPS receivers only transmit data through an expansion
slot or a cable; a receiver with a cable is often called a mouse GPS receiver
because it resembles a computer mouse. Such receivers are designed 
to interface with a laptop computer or PDA running special software.
Figure 3-3 shows a DeLorme Earthmate GPS unit attached to a laptop. All
GPS data is sent to the laptop and processed there with mapping soft-
ware. A Magellan SporTrak GPS receiver is shown on top of the laptop
for comparison.
Most GPS receivers that have screens can output data to a PC or PDA.
59
Chapter 3: GPS Fundamentals

A GPS receiver’s screen size depends on the receiver’s size. Smaller, lighter
models have small screens; larger units sport bigger screens.
Generally, a bigger screen is easier to read. Different models of GPS receiver
also have different pixel resolutions; the higher the screen resolution, the
more crisp the display will be. For night use, all screens can be backlit.
Alarms
A GPS receiver alarm can transmit a tone or display a message when you
approach a location that you specify. This feature can be especially useful
when you’re trying to find a place and visibility is limited by darkness or
inclement weather — or you’re busy doing something else and aren’t looking
at the GPS receiver screen.
Built-in maps
Every GPS receiver has an information page that shows waypoints and
tracks. The page is a simple map that plots travel and locations. It doesn’t
show roads, geographic features, or man-made structures. Figure 3-4 shows
two GPS receiver screens: simple location plotting on the left, and a more
sophisticated, uploaded map on the right.

Part II: All About GPS 

Some GPS receivers have maps that show roads, rivers, cities, and other fea-
tures on their screens. You can zoom in and out to show different levels of
detail. The two types of map receivers are
 Basemap: These GPS units have a basemap loaded into read-only
memory that contains roads, highways, water bodies, cities, airports,
railroads, and interstate exits.
Basemap GPS receivers aren’t expandable, and you can’t load more
detailed maps to the unit to supplement the existing basemap.
 Uploadable map: More detailed maps can be added to this type of unit
(in either internal memory or an external memory card). You can install
road maps, topographic maps, and nautical charts. Many of these maps
also have built-in databases, so your GPS receiver can display restau-
rants, gas stations, or attractions near a certain location.
Chapter 9 covers features and how to use GPS receiver manufacturer
mapping programs to upload maps to your GPS unit.
Refer to Figure 3-4 to see screens from a GPS receiver with a simple plot map
and another GPS unit with an uploadable map.
GPS receivers that display maps use proprietary map data from the 
manufacturer. That means you can’t load another manufacturer’s or 
software company’s maps into a GPS receiver. However, clever hackers
reverse-engineered Garmin’s map format. Programs on the Internet can
create and upload your own maps to Garmin GPS receivers; GPSmapper is
popular.
A handheld GPS receiver’s screen is only several inches across. The limita-
tions of such a small display certainly don’t make the devices replacements
for traditional paper maps.

Chapter 3: GPS Fundamentals

Electronic compass
All GPS receivers can tell you which direction you’re heading — that is, as
long as you’re moving. The minute you stop, the receiver stops acting as a
compass. To address this limitation, some GPS receivers incorporate an elec-
tronic compass that doesn’t rely on the GPS satellites.
Operation
Like with an old-fashioned compass, you can stand still and see which direc-
tion your GPS receiver is pointing toward. The only difference is that you see
a digital display onscreen instead of a floating needle.
On some GPS receivers, you need to hold the unit flat and level for the com-
pass to work correctly. Other models have a three-axis compass that allows
the receiver to be tilted.
Paying attention to these factors can improve the performance and conve-
nience of an electronic compass:
 Magnetic fields: Metal objects, cars, and other electronic devices reduce
the accuracy of any electronic or magnetic compass.
 Battery life: Using an electronic compass can impact battery life. Some
GPS receivers have settings that turn off the compass or only use it
when the receiver can’t determine a direction from satellite data.
Calibration
Electronic compasses need to be calibrated whenever you change batteries.
If your GPS unit has an electronic compass, follow your user guide’s instruc-
tions to calibrate it. Usually, this requires being outside, holding the GPS unit
flat and level, and slowly turning in a circle twice.
Altimeter
The elevation or altitude calculated by a GPS receiver from satellite data isn’t
very accurate. Because of this, some GPS units have altimeters, which provide
the elevation, ascent/descent rates, change in elevation over distance or time,
and the change of barometric pressure over time. (The rough-and-ready rule
is that if barometric pressure is falling, bad weather is on the way; if it’s rising,
clear weather is coming.) Calibrated and used correctly, barometric altimeters
can be accurate within 10 feet of the actual elevation. Knowing your altitude
is useful if you have something to reference it to, such as a topographic map.
Altimeters are useful for hiking or in the mountains.
62
Part II: All About GPS 

On GPS units with an electronic altimeter/barometer, calibrating the altimeter
to ensure accuracy is important. To do so, visit a physical location with a
known elevation and enter the elevation according to the directions in your
user’s guide. Airports are good places to calibrate your altimeter or get an
initial base reading; their elevation is posted for pilots to calibrate their air-
planes’ altimeters. If you’re relying on the altimeter/barometer for recre-
ational use, I recommend calibrating it before you head out on a trip.
Increasing accuracy
Some GPS receivers have features that allow you to increase the accuracy of
your location by using radio signals not associated with the GPS satellites. 
If you see that a GPS receiver supports WAAS or Differential GPS, it has the
potential to provide you with more accurate location data.
WAAS
Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) combines satellites and ground sta-
tions for position accuracy of better than three meters. Vertical accuracy is
also improved to three to seven meters.
WAAS is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) system, so GPS can be used
for airplane flight approaches. The system has a series of ground-reference sta-
tions throughout the United States. These monitor GPS satellite data and then
send the data to two master stations — one on the west coast and the other
on the east coast. These master stations create a GPS message that corrects
for position inaccuracies caused by satellite orbital drift and atmospheric
conditions. The corrected messages are sent to non-NAVSTAR satellites in
stationary orbit over the equator. The satellites then broadcast the data to
GPS receivers that are WAAS-enabled.
GPS units that support WAAS have a built-in receiver to process the WAAS
signals. You don’t need more hardware. Some GPS receivers support turning
WAAS on and off. If WAAS is on, battery life is shorter (although not as signifi-
cantly as it is when using the backlight). In fact, on these models, you can’t
use WAAS if the receiver’s battery-saver mode is activated. Whether you turn
WAAS on or off depends on your needs. Unless you need a higher level of
accuracy, you can leave WAAS turned off if your GPS receiver supports tog-
gling it on and off. WAAS is ideally suited for aviation as well as for open land
and marine use. The system may not, however, provide any benefits in areas
where trees or mountains obstruct the view of the horizon.
63
Chapter 3: GPS Fundamentals

Under certain conditions — say, when weak WAAS satellite signals are being
received or the GPS receiver is a long way from a ground station — accuracy
can actually worsen when WAAS is enabled.
WAAS is only available in North America. Other governments are establishing
similar systems that use the same format radio signals such as
 European Euro Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS)
 Japanese Multi-Functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS)
Differential GPS
Surveying and other work that demands a high level of precision use
Differential GPS (DGPS) to increase the position accuracy of a GPS receiver. 
A stationary receiver measures GPS timing errors and broadcasts correction
information to other GPS units that are capable of receiving the DGPS signals.
Consumer GPS receivers that support DGPS require a separate beacon receiver
that connects to the GPS unit. Consumers can receive DGPS signals from free
or commercial sources.
Unless you’re doing survey or other specialized work, you really don’t need
DGPS capabilities. For consumer use, the increased accuracy of DGPS has
mostly been replaced with WAAS.
Coast Guard DGPS
DGPS signals are freely broadcast by a series of U.S. Coast Guard stations in
the United States. Whether you can receive these Coast Guard broadcasts
depends on your location.
For more information on DGPS, including coverage maps, pay a visit to
www.navcen.uscg.gov/dgps/coverage/default.htm.
Commercial DGPS
DGPS services are offered commercially for the surveying market. You can
rent or purchase electronic and radio equipment for gathering precise loca-
tion information in a relatively small area.
Antennas
Well, yes, a GPS unit has to have an antenna to receive radio signals to do you
any good. Several types are available, each with its advantages.
64
Part II: All About GPS 

Internal antennas
All GPS receivers have one of two kinds of built-in antennas. One antenna
design isn’t superior to the other; performance is related to the receiver’s
antenna size. (Cough . . . bigger is better.)
Patch
An internal patch antenna is a square conductor mounted over a groundplane
(another square piece of metal). Patch antenna models reacquire satellites
faster after losing the signal.
For best performance with an internal patch antenna, hold the receiver face
up and parallel with the ground.
Quad helix
An internal quadrifilar helix antenna (or quad helix) is a circular tube
wrapped with wire. Quad helix antennas are more sensitive and work better
under tree cover than the other types.
For best performance with an internal quad helix antenna, hold the receiver
so that the top is pointing up to the sky.
External antennas
Some GPS receivers have connectors for attaching external antennas. An
external antenna is useful if the GPS receiver’s view of the sky is otherwise
blocked, like in a boat, a car, an airplane, or a backpack.
Reradiating antennas
If a GPS receiver doesn’t have a jack for connecting an external antenna, you
can improve the reception with a reradiating antenna. These antennas work
just as well as conventional external antennas that plug into a GPS receiver.
A reradiating antenna combines two GPS antennas:
 One antenna receives the GPS signal from the satellites.
 The other antenna is connected to the first and positioned next to the
GPS unit’s internal antenna.
Here are a couple of sources for reradiating antennas:
 Roll your own: If you’re handy with a soldering iron, search Google for
reradiating antenna GPS for tips on how to make one yourself.
 Buy one: Purchase an assembled reradiating antenna from Pc-Mobile at
www.pc-mobile.net/gpsant.htm.
65
Chapter 3: GPS Fundamentals

Internal memory
A receiver’s internal memory holds such data as waypoints, track logs, routes,
and uploadable digital maps (if the model supports them). The more memory
the receiver has, the more data you can store in it. All the data that’s been
stored in the GPS receiver is retained when the device is turned off.
GPS receivers have different amounts of memory. Unlike personal computers,
you can’t add memory chips to a GPS unit to expand its internal memory.
External storage
Some GPS receivers aren’t limited to internal memory for storage, using 
support memory cards that can be plugged into the receiver to store data.
External memory can be either
 Manufacturer proprietary data cards
 Generic (and less expensive) storage, such as
• MultiMediaCard (MMC; www.mmca.org)
• Secure Digital (SD; www.sandisk.com)
Accessory programs
Many GPS receivers have built-in accessory programs that display various
handy features such as
 Calendars with the best time to hunt and fish
 Sunrise, moonrise, sunset, and moonset tables
 Tide tables
 Calculators
 Games
User interface modes
Some GPS receivers have simple and advanced user interface modes.
66
Part II: All About GPS 

 Simple mode: This displays only often used commands and features.
This is an excellent option for the novice user who wants to use basic
GPS receiver functions without being distracted or confused by the
many other features.
 Advanced mode: This shows all commands and features.
Synthesized voice
Some models of GPS receiver, designed primarily for automotive use, have a
synthesized voice that provides you with route-finding information. Although
this feature has been available as an option in some luxury cars for many
years (for example, in the OnStar system), portable GPS units that talk to you
are available. You don’t have to pay monthly subscription fees for them, and
you can easily move them from car to car. (Ah, progress.)
You can find more information in Chapter 5 on how to select a portable GPS
receiver to use for road navigation.
If you’re using your GPS receiver primarily for navigation in your vehicle,
mount it securely so that it doesn’t slide around the dashboard.
 GPS receiver manufacturers make mounting brackets for in-vehicle use.
 Do-it-yourself solutions can include Velcro, Silly Putty, small beanbags,
or modeling clay (the nonhardening type).
Never mount your GPS unit where an airbag deploys during a crash.
67
Chapter 3: GPS Fundamentals
GPS monopoly
The U.S. has had a monopoly on satellite-based
location systems over the years (the Russian
GLONASS, Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite
System, has really never been a viable player),
but that may soon change.
The European Union is moving toward deploy-
ing its own positioning system called Galileo. If
everything goes as planned, Galileo will be oper-
ational by 2008 with a constellation of 30 sta-
tionary satellites. Position accuracy is touted as
within a meter, which is ten times more precise
than what GPS currently provides to civilians.
The United States isn’t happy about this; as an
alternative, GPS prevents the U.S. government
and military from selectively degrading signals
and blocking use elsewhere in the world. China,
Israel, and India have expressed interest in
becoming involved with Galileo. As of early 2004,
after a number of negotiation sessions, the U.S.
and European Union had reached a number of
compromises that met both parties’ needs.

energy_transport/galileo/
index_en.htm

The Future of GPS
Modern technology rapidly evolves, and the same holds true for GPS. Since
consumer GPS receivers first became available in the mid-1990s, the market
has grown tremendously because of cheaper receiver prices and new ways to
use GPS. A peek into a crystal ball shows what the future may hold for GPS.
 More accurate: The United States has started planning the next generation
of GPS, dubbed GPS III. Driving factors are better accuracy and reliability,
improved resistance to signal jamming, and the looming European Galileo
system. Increasing the number of WAAS satellites in orbit is also planned.
The first GPS III satellite is tentatively planned for launch in 2012. The U.S.
government budget will have an impact on plans to improve the present
GPS system; the Iraq invasion delayed the launch of several satellites.
 Smaller: GPS receivers will continue to shrink. GPS units already are
integrated into wristwatches, and PC Card GPS receivers can plug into a
laptop or PDA.
The three limiting factors that prevent a consumer receiver from shrink-
ing are antenna size, screen size, and power source size
 Cheaper: Prices will continue to decline as manufacturing costs
decrease and production quantities increase.
 Easier to use: Simplified and less technical user interfaces will become
more of a priority as GPS receivers become more appliancelike to meet
the needs of specialized markets. An example is Garmin’s Forerunner
product, which is targeted to runners and lacks a number of features
typically found in traditional GPS receivers.
 Easier to view: Improved screen technology will make GPS receiver
screens brighter and easier to read.
 More integrated: GPS receivers are being integrated into cars and trucks,
cellphones, PDAs, Family Radio Service (FRS) radios, and other consumer
electronic devices. Expect some new products and services that take
advantage of location-aware data.
 Thriftier: User-replaceable AA and AAA batteries have long powered
portable GPS receivers, but expect some changes in power sources.
• Built-in Lithium ion (Li-Ion) and nickel metal-hydride (NiMH) bat-
teries, popular in cellphones and laptops, make sense for GPS
receivers. Garmin started releasing rechargeable GPS receivers at
the end of 2003.
• Further on the horizon, miniature fuel cell technology will keep
GPS units going and going without frequent battery changes.
 Less wired: Most GPS receivers transfer data from personal computers
through a cable. Wireless technologies such as Bluetooth (www.blue
tooth.com) and wireless USB are well suited for fast and easy data
transfers to GPS receivers without using cables.

Grasping Important GPS Concepts
In This Chapter
 Understanding GPS, maps, and coordinate systems
 Working with GPS and datums
 Setting GPS receiver waypoints
 Using routes
 Making the most of tracks
I
n Chapter 3, I provide you with a pretty good idea of what Global
Positioning System (GPS) is and how it works. In addition to knowing about
the satellites, ground stations, and receivers, however, you should have a
grasp of some important concepts before you start using a GPS receiver —
things like coordinate systems, datums, waypoints, routes, and tracks.
Even if you already own a GPS receiver and have used it for a while, this is
still a good chapter to skim through because some of these basic concepts
that I discuss end up being overlooked in user manuals or can get a bit fuzzy
if you don’t use your GPS receiver on a regular basis. Read on while I help
clarify some important terms and concepts (like datums and waypoints and
routes) so you’ll be (pardon the pun) moving in the right direction.
Linking GPS, Maps, and
Coordinate Systems
Some people think that after they have a GPS receiver, they really don’t need
a map, especially if the receiver has built-in mapping capabilities. This isn’t
necessarily true. GPS receivers are best used in conjunction with maps,
whether those maps are paper or digital. Here are some of the reasons why:
 Detail: Most maps on handheld GPS receivers don’t offer the detail of
full-size paper or digital maps, especially topographic maps and nautical
charts.

 Size: A GPS receiver’s screen is pretty darn small, and it’s just about
impossible to get the big picture that a full-size map can give you.
 Backup: If you have a paper map with you and know how to use it, the
map becomes an important backup if your GPS receiver’s batteries fail
or if you encounter poor satellite coverage. Gadget lovers might con-
sider a paper map and magnetic compasses primitive, but they don’t
require batteries — and both are lightweight and cheap, to boot.
 Complementary: After you get back home or to the office, you might
want to see where you’ve been on a map, based on the locations that
you’ve stored in the GPS receiver. With a digital map, you can easily plot
the exact route that you took or identify the places you visited.
All maps and GPS receivers use coordinate systems, which are grids on maps
that enable you to find locations on a map. Because GPS receivers are
designed for use with maps, they support a number of coordinate systems
that correspond to those commonly found on maps. (Chapter 2 has informa-
tion on using map coordinate systems.) Thus, you can take a location that
you recorded on your GPS receiver and precisely locate it on a map.
By default, your GPS receiver displays positions in latitude and longitude.
But you can change the settings to display locations in exotic-sounding
coordinate systems such as the Finnish KKJ27 grid, the Qatar grid, or the
W Malaysian R grid. You probably won’t need to switch to some of these
obscure coordinate systems, so you can stick with latitude and longitude or
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), which are used pretty much every-
where. If you’re fuzzy on what latitude and longitude or UTM are, check out
Chapter 2, which gives an overview of the two coordinate systems.

Land navigation
Discovering how to effectively use paper maps
and compasses for land navigation is both an
art and a science, with complete books written
on the subject. Here are two excellent, free
online resources if you want to find out more.
 Map and Compass for Firefighters (NFES
2554) is a self-study course developed by
the U.S. government for wildland firefight-
ers. The course is available at www.nwcg.
gov/pms/training/map_comp.pdf.
 Map Reading and Land Navigation (FM 
3-25.26) is the U.S. Army field manual on the
subject, available at www.army.mil/
usapa/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/
fm3_25x26.pdf.
Another great way to become a pro land navi-
gator is through the sport of orienteering.
Orienteering involves using a map and compass
to find control points (small flags) in the short-
est amount of time as possible. Do a Web
search for orienteering to find more about the
sport and how you can participate in clubs and
events in your local area.

Suppose you have your GPS receiver set to latitude and longitude, and you
record some locations. When you get home, you find out that your paper
map doesn’t have latitude and longitude marks but uses only the UTM coor-
dinate system. Not a problem. Look in your GPS receiver user manual for
information on changing the coordinate system from latitude and longitude
to UTM. Location points that you store in latitude and longitude appear as
UTM coordinates. This is a quick and easy way of converting data between
coordinate systems. Or you can visit the Graphical Locator Home Page at
Montana State University (www.esg.montana.edu/gl/index.html) to per-
form online conversions of latitude and longitude and Township and Range.
Although Township and Range is a popular coordinate system used on many
maps in the United States, don’t expect your GPS receiver to support this
system. Unlike the latitude and longitude and UTM grid systems, which were
mathematically derived, grids in the Township and Range system may not
always be the same size, thus making it difficult for a GPS receiver to deter-
mine coordinates in this system. Most maps that have Township and Range
information also have latitude and longitude or UTM marks. If you have a
location reported in Township and Range, you’ll need to spend a bit of time
looking at a map, manually figuring out the position that the coordinates
point to, and then plot that position by using a different coordinate system.
71
Chapter 4: Grasping Important GPS Concepts
How much latitude?
GPS units can display latitude and longitude in
several different formats. Take the location at
the top of Mt. Bachelor (some great skiing in
Central Oregon if you’re ever in the neighbor-
hood) and see how it can be expressed.
 Degrees, minutes, decimal seconds (D° M'
S"): 43° 58' 46.94" N, 121° 41' 14.73" W
 Degrees, decimal minutes (D° M.M'): 43°
58.7824' N, 121° 41.2455' W
 Decimal degrees (D.D°): 43.9797069° N,
121.6874253° W
And just for fun, here are the UTM coordinates
for that same location: 10T 0605273E, 48 70240N.
Ouch! Is this confusing or what? Although it
doesn’t seem like it, all these coordinates refer
to the exact same location. Remember, just like
converting locations from one coordinate system
to another, you can also use your GPS receiver
as a calculator to convert from different latitude
and longitude formats. Suppose you have some
coordinates in decimal degrees and need them
in degrees, minutes, and seconds:
1. Change the coordinate settings in your GPS
receiver to decimal degrees.
2. Manually enter the coordinates as a
waypoint.
3. Change the coordinate settings in your GPS
receiver to degrees, minutes, and seconds.
When you look at the coordinates of the way-
point that you entered, they’re now displayed in
degrees, minutes, and seconds. (Note: Because
changing coordinate systems varies from model
to model, check your user manual for specific
instructions.)

Understanding GPS and Datums
As I discuss in Chapter 2, a datum is a frame of reference for mapping. Because
the earth isn’t flat, geographic coordinate systems use ellipsoids (think of a
sphere that’s not perfectly spherical, much like the shape of the Earth) to cal-
culate positions on our third planet from the sun. A datum is the position of
the ellipsoid relative to the center of the earth.
Unless you’re a cartographer or geographer, that probably hurts just thinking
about it. Sparing you a long and detailed technical description (which you can
get in Chapter 2), here are the two important things that you need to know:
 All maps have a datum. Hundreds of different datums are in use. Most
good maps used for navigation — and highway maps don’t count —
usually state which datum was used in making the map.
 You can set what datum your GPS receiver uses. An example of a GPS
map datum page is shown in Figure 4-1.
The default datum for GPS receivers is WGS 84, more formally known as the
World Geodetic System 1984. WGS 84 was adopted as a world standard and is
derived from a datum called the North American Datum of 1983.
Most USGS topographic maps that you use for hiking are based on an earlier
datum called the North American Datum of 1927, or NAD 27. This datum is
divided into different geographic areas, so if you’re in the United States — at
least in the lower 48 states — use a version of NAD 27 that mentions the con-
tinental U.S.
So why is all this datum stuff so important? In the United States, if a position
is saved in a GPS receiver by using the WGS 84 datum and the same coordi-
nates are plotted on a map that uses the NAD 27 datum, the location can be
off as much as 200 meters. That’s more than a couple of football fields off.
The latitude and longitude coordinates will be identical, but the location is
going to end up in two different spots.
Figure 4-1:

72
Part II: All About GPS 

The moral of the story is to make sure that the datums on your GPS receiver
and maps are the same. Or, if you’re with a group of people using GPS
receivers, make sure that all your datums match.
Not having the map datum match the GPS receiver datum is one of the
biggest errors that new users of GPS receivers make. I can’t emphasize this
point strongly enough: Make sure that the two match!
Setting Waypoints
A waypoint is GPS lingo for a location or point that you store in your GPS
receiver. Some manufacturers also call them marks or landmarks. A waypoint
consists of the following information:
 Location: The location of the waypoint in whichever coordinate system
the GPS receiver is currently using. Some receivers also store the eleva-
tion of the location.
 Name: The name of the waypoint. You get to choose your own name; the
length varies between GPS receiver models from six characters on up.
 Date and time: The date and time the waypoint was created.
 Optional icon or symbol: An optional icon or symbol associated with
the waypoint that appears on the GPS receiver’s map page when the
area around the waypoint is displayed. This could be a tent for a camp-
ground, a boat for a boat launch, or a fish for a favorite fishing spot.
73
Chapter 4: Grasping Important GPS Concepts
Datum lessons learned
Here’s a quick story from my Forest Service fire-
fighting days that illustrates the importance of
being aware of datums. A fire was reported in a
mountainous area of eastern Oregon, and my
partner and I helicopter-rappelled in to put out
the fire. Because the fire was bigger than
expected, we requested some smokejumpers to
assist. They were down from Alaska, helping
out during the lower 48’s fire season, and they
all had new handheld GPS receivers, which
were pretty state of the art back then (1998). The
fire continued to grow, and we called in a small
air tanker to stop the fire’s spread. One of the
Alaska jumpers pulled out his GPS unit, and we
called in an exact set of coordinates for the pilot
to hit. As the tanker approached, the pilot
radioed us, asking whether we were sure that
was where we wanted the retardant to go.
Turns out that the jumper still had his GPS unit
set with an Alaska map datum (that didn’t match
the local datum on the pilot’s GPS receiver), and
the coordinates that the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) jumper gave were on the
other side of the ridge, nowhere near the fire.
Fortunately, the pilot used his own initiative and
dumped his load right where it needed to go.

All GPS receivers can store waypoints, but the maximum number that you
can save varies from model to model. As a general rule, as the price of a GPS
receiver goes up, so does the number of waypoints that can be stored.
Lower-end consumer GPS receivers store 100–250 waypoints, and top-of-the-
line models can store 1,000 or more.
Saving waypoints
The two types of waypoints you can enter and save to your GPS receiver are
 Current location: GPS receivers have a button on the case or an onscreen
command for marking the current location as a waypoint. (Check your
user manual for details.) After the waypoint is marked, the GPS receiver
screen displays a waypoint information page where you can name the
waypoint and associate an icon with it.
 Known location: If you know the coordinates of a location that you want
to save as a waypoint, you can manually enter it in the GPS receiver.
Most GPS receivers also allow you to mark wherever the cursor is on the
map page as a waypoint. A known location could be a good fishing spot
that a friend saved to his GPS receiver or perhaps a lake you want to
visit that you got the coordinates from a digital map. Again, check your
user manual for directions on how to manually enter a waypoint. In
Figure 4-2, you can see a Lowrance iFINDER waypoint page that’s dis-
played when you press its ENT button.
Always use meaningful names when you save a waypoint. GPS receivers typi-
cally assign a sequential number as the default waypoint name. Although
numbers and cryptic codes might make sense when you enter them, I guaran-
tee you that you probably won’t remember what they mean a couple of
weeks down the road.
Some GPS units have a MOB function, which has nothing whatever to do with
tommy guns or cement shoes. MOB stands for Man Overboard and was
designed for boaters to use in case someone fell into the water. (Go figure.)
After seeing or hearing the splash, the captain can press a button (that cre-
ates a waypoint appropriately named MOB) and then turn around and head
back to the exact location of the unlucky sailor.
Although a GPS receiver is good for letting you know where you are, way-
points are important for helping you get somewhere you’d like to go. GPS
receivers have a number of features that can help you navigate to a waypoint
that you’ve entered.
Maybe you decide to go for a hike. Before you leave the trailhead, you save
the location of the parking lot as a waypoint, naming it PRKLOT. Note: Some
GPS receivers support waypoint names only in uppercase characters; others
allow you to use both uppercase and lowercase characters.

Part II: All About GPS 

As you hike down the trail, you hear the call of a rare ivory-billed wood-
pecker and head off into the brush, intent on getting a sighting of the very
elusive bird. After an hour of tromping around in the dense woods, you dis-
cover two things. First, the bird was just a robin; second, you’re totally
turned around and are somewhat lost. But fortunately, because you have a
GPS receiver with you (and have read this book), you know that you’ll be able
to easily find your way back to the car and be home in time for dinner. The
following sections show you how.
Using the waypoint list
GPS receivers have an information page that lists all the waypoints that
you’ve created and stored. (Again, check your user manual for information on
how to access and use this list.) The waypoints can be listed by name or
those closest to your current location. By selecting a waypoint, no matter
where you are, you can find your way to it.
 The distance to the waypoint, such as a parking lot or trailhead.
 The compass direction in degrees that you’ll need to head to get to the
waypoint.
In Figure 4-3, see a GPS receiver screen providing information on how to
get to a selected waypoint.

Any of the waypoints in the list can be deleted or edited. See your user
manual for specific instructions.
If you roam around the Internet searching for information about GPS, you’ll
come across handy collections of waypoints that you can enter into your GPS
receiver. There are all manner of waypoint lists, from fishing spots to pubs in
England. If you’re planning a vacation, consider doing a Web search ahead of
time to see whether there are any waypoints associated with your destina-
tion. Then bring your GPS receiver along with you as a personal tour guide.
GPS receivers designed for outdoor use always assume a straight line as the
route between two points. That might be convenient for airplanes and boats,
but it doesn’t take into account cliffs, rivers, streams, fences, and other
obstacles on land. GPS receivers designed for automobile navigation are a bit
smarter, having built-in databases of road information that’s used in suggest-
ing and measuring appropriate routes from Point A to Point B.
Depending on the GPS receiver model, other waypoint-related information
that you may be able to display includes
 Travel time: The amount of time it will take you to reach the waypoint
based on your current speed.
 Compass: A picture of a compass that displays the waypoint direction
heading.
 Directional arrow: An arrow that points in the correct direction that
you should be heading.
 Navigational hints: A picture of a road that moves as you travel. If the
road is centered onscreen, your destination is straight ahead. If the road
veers to the right or the left, you need to correct your course so that the
road is centered. A symbol associated with the waypoint will grow larger
as you get closer to it.
Some GPS receivers come with databases of cities, highways, airports, land-
marks, and other geographic features. These are just waypoints stored in
memory that you can’t edit or delete to free up memory for new waypoints.

Part II: All About GPS 

Most GPS receivers support mapping. At the very least, a GPS receiver has
a simple plot display, a map page that shows waypoints, tracks (see the
upcoming section, “Making Tracks”), and your current position. More
advanced (and expensive) GPS receivers support more sophisticated maps;
your waypoints and tracks appear along with roads, rivers, bodies of water,
and whatever built-in features the map has. When the map page is displayed,
you can zoom in, zoom out, and move around the map with an onscreen
cursor that you control with buttons on the GPS receiver.
A map page can be orientated two ways: so either the top of the screen
always faces north or the top of the screen faces the direction you’re travel-
ing. Orientating the screen to the north is probably the easiest if you’re used
to working with maps, which usually are orientated with their tops to the
north.
Following Routes
A route is a course that you’re currently traveling or plan to take. In GPS
terms, a route is the course between one or more waypoints (see Figure 4-4).
If multiple waypoints are in a route, the course between two waypoints is a
leg. A single route can be made up of a number of legs.
Suppose it was a beautiful day, and you went hiking, deciding to make a loop:
hike from a parking lot trailhead to a scenic waterfall, go over to a lake for
some lunch on a sandy beach, and finally head cross-country until you reach
a trail intersection that would take you back to your starting point at the
parking lot. You’ve hiked in the area before; in fact, you’ve visited each of
your planned destinations and marked them as waypoints in your GPS

receiver. However, you’ve never hiked this particular loop before, so you
decide to make a route called LOOP with the following legs that you’ve
already previously entered as waypoints:
PRKLOT to WTRFALL
WTRFALL to LAKE
LAKE to TRAILX
TRAILX to PRKLOT
After you create your route, the GPS receiver tells you how long each leg will
be and also the total distance of the route. When you activate the route (tell
the GPS receiver you’re ready to use it), this information is displayed:
 Direction: The direction you need to travel in order to reach the next
waypoint in the route
 Distance: How far away the next waypoint is
 Duration: How much time it’s going to take to get there
After you reach a waypoint in the route, the GPS receiver automatically starts
calculating the information for the next leg. This continues until you reach
your final destination.
78
Part II: All About GPS 
To route or not to route
A fair number of GPS receiver owners don’t use
routes and find them to be an overrated feature.
After all, after you reach your first destination,
you can easily select the next location from the
waypoint list and be on your way. In addition, if
you want to record where you’ve been, just
using tracks is much easier. I discuss this in the
section, “Making Tracks.” However, here are a
couple of situations when you should consider
using routes:
 If you’re traveling to the same location on a
regular basis (such as a guide leading
clients on established trips).
 If you’re planning on sharing a route with
other GPS receiver owners. Think of this as
being a virtual tour guide. Routes can be
downloaded and then uploaded to other
GPS receivers.
 If you have a mapping program, you can
plan a trip ahead of time and create routes
on your computer by simply clicking your
mouse where you want to go. When you’re
finished, you can upload the route to your
GPS receiver.
Using routes is a personal preference. Try cre-
ating and using routes to see whether they meet
your needs. If they don’t, you can get by with
waypoints and tracks.

Don’t confuse a route with an autoroute, which applies to GPS receivers that
can provide you with turn-by-turn street directions to a destination you’re
driving to. AutoRoute is also the name of a Microsoft European street map-
ping program.
Routes can be created ahead of time or entered while you’re traveling. Like
with waypoints, after you create a route, you can delete or edit it, including
removing or adding waypoints within legs.
Whenever you’re using a route or navigating to a waypoint, you don’t need to
leave your GPS receiver on all the time. You can shut it off every now and then
to conserve batteries. When you turn the GPS receiver back on, just select
the waypoint or route that you were using, and the GPS receiver recalculates
your present position and gives you updated information about how to reach
your destination.
The number of routes and the number of waypoints that a route can consist
of vary from one GPS receiver to another. Some inexpensive GPS receivers
don’t support routes, but a high-end consumer GPS unit might have up to 50
routes with up to 125 waypoints in each route.
Making Tracks
Remember the story of Hansel and Gretel, the kids who dropped bread-
crumbs in the forest to try to find their way back home? Their story would’ve
had a different ending if they had a GPS receiver because all newer GPS
receivers leave electronic breadcrumbs (called tracks or trails depending on
the manufacturer) while you travel. Every so often, the GPS receiver saves
the coordinates of the current position to memory. This series of tracks is a
track log or track history. (Because various GPS models handle tracks differ-
ently, check your user manual for specific details.)
Note these differences between tracks and waypoints:
 Names and symbols: Although tracks and waypoints are both location
data points, tracks don’t have names or symbols associated with them
and can’t be edited in the GPS receiver.
 Autocreation: Unlike waypoints — that you need to manually enter —
tracks are automatically created whenever a GPS receiver is turned on
(that is, if you have the track feature enabled).
If track logging is enabled, tracks are shown on the GPS receiver’s map page
while you move, like a trail of breadcrumbs. The GPS receiver constantly col-
lects tracks while it’s powered on, so you need to clear the current track log
before you start a new trip. If you want, you can save a current track log.
79
Chapter 4: Grasping Important GPS Concepts

If you turn your GPS receiver off or if you lose satellite reception, the GPS
receiver stops recording tracks. When it’s turned back on again or good satel-
lite coverage resumes, the GPS receiver continues recording tracks, but it will
assume that you traveled in a straight line between the last track location
saved, before satellite reception was lost, and your current position.
Some GPS receivers allow you to set how often tracks are saved, either by
time or distance intervals. For example, you could specify that a track be
saved every minute or each time that you travel a tenth of a mile. Leaving the
default, automatic setting for track collection should work for most occa-
sions. However, if you’re using your GPS receiver for specialized purposes
(such as mapping a trail), you may want to experiment with different inter-
vals to give you the level of detail that you need.
When you reach your final destination, your GPS receiver can optionally use
the track log to help you navigate back to your starting point by using the
track data to guide you retracing your steps. Check your user manual for
model specific instructions on how to do this.
Tracks are probably one of the most useful GPS receiver features if you’re
working with digital maps. From a number of free and commercial mapping
programs, you can overlay your tracks on top of a map to see exactly where
you’ve been. Figure 4-5 shows an example of track data collected during a
trail run and then uploaded to a mapping program.
Figure 4-5:

80
Part II: All About GPS 

Depending on the model, GPS receivers can store between 1,000 and 10,000
tracks and up to 10 track logs. If you exceed the maximum number of tracks,
the GPS receiver will either stop collecting tracks or begin overwriting the
oldest tracks that were collected first with the most current ones. (Some GPS
receivers let you define what action to take.) The number of tracks collected
over time depends completely on your activity, speed, GPS coverage, and the
GPS receiver’s track setting. Just to give you a ballpark idea, when I go trail
running with a Garmin Geko 201, the receiver typically collects around 250
tracks an hour on its default track setting.
Some GPS receivers reduce the number of tracks in saved track logs. For
example, if you have 5,100 track points in the active track log, the number
might be reduced to 750 track points when you save the log. This is done to
save memory. You’ll still have a general sense of where you’ve been, but you
lose detail. If you need a high level of detail — such as if you were mapping a
trail — always download the active track log to a computer first before saving
the track log to your GPS receiver.
You can download waypoints, routes, and tracks to your personal computer.
The data can then be stored on your hard drive, used with digital mapping
programs, or loaded into other GPS receivers. You can also upload waypoints,
routes, and tracks that you create on your computer to your GPS receiver.
See Chapter 9 for tips on how to interface your GPS receiver to a computer.

Chapter 4: Grasping Important GPS Concepts
GPSBabel
You won’t find any standards when it comes to
GPS receiver waypoint, route, and track for-
mats. Each GPS receiver manufacturer seems
to have its own data format. To further com-
plicate things, software companies that make
mapping programs also use their own data
formats. This can make exchanging GPS data
between different receivers and software a very
big challenge.
In order to help address this, the folks at
topoGraphix (www.topographix.com), a GPS
and map software company, developed GPX.
GPX stands for GPS Exchange, which is a light-
weight, XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
data format for exchanging waypoints, routes,
and tracks between applications and Web ser-
vices on the Internet. GPX is slowly building up
momentum and is being adopted by both soft-
ware vendors and Web service providers.
However, until a standard is widely adopted
(and I’m personally not holding my breath), your
best bet to exchange GPS data is the free
GPSBabel utility. This versatile program con-
verts information created by one type of GPS
receiver or software program into formats that
can be read by others. GPSBabel is available for
a number of different operating systems as a
command line utility, and you can find easy-to-
use Windows front-ends if you prefer a mouse
and menus.

Selecting and Getting Started 
with a GPS Receiver
In This Chapter
 Selecting a GPS receiver
 Matching GPS receivers with activities
 Powering your GPS receiver
 Initializing your GPS receiver
 Using your GPS receiver
T
his chapter is about selecting a GPS receiver and getting started using it.
Choosing a GPS receiver can be quite an overwhelming experience. If you
look at handheld, portable GPS receivers that the Big Three (Garmin, Magellan,
and Lowrance) currently offer, you’ll have around 50–60 GPS receivers to
choose from. That’s a lot of choices. And that’s only the beginning. After you
purchase one, you still need to find out how to use it.
This chapter should take some of the confusion out of buying a GPS receiver
and help you come up to speed using it. (GPS For Dummies isn’t meant to
replace your user manual, though, which you should refer to while you’re
reading the “Becoming Familiar with Your New GPS Receiver” section of this
chapter.)
When it comes to selecting a GPS receiver, I won’t recommend that you buy a
particular brand or model or tell you which is best for hiking, geocaching (the
best Easter egg hunt in the world; see Chapter 9), or other activities. Rather, I
follow more of a Socratic method, in which I ask you a number of questions
that should help you make a pretty good and informed purchasing decision.

Selecting a GPS Receiver
Before you purchase a GPS receiver, you should spend some time kicking the
proverbial tires. Don’t rush out and buy a receiver based on one or two good
Internet reviews without having a chance to hold that very GPS receiver in
your hands to see how it works. Spend some time comparing different brands
and models to determine which one works best for you. Because GPS units
are sold in most sporting goods stores and many large retail chains, you
shouldn’t have to buy a receiver sight unseen.
The three largest manufacturers of consumer GPS receivers in the United
States are Garmin, Magellan (a part of Thales Navigation), and Lowrance. All
these manufacturers have extensive Web sites that provide detailed informa-
tion about their products. If you’re in the market for a GPS receiver, definitely
spend some time browsing through product literature. The Web site
addresses for these manufacturers are
 Garmin: www.garmin.com
 Magellan: www.magellangps.com
 Lowrance: www.lowrance.com
And don’t just look at the marketing literature. Download the user manuals
for the models you’re interested in to better understand their features.
All GPS receiver manufacturers offer free Adobe Acrobat PDF versions of their
product user manuals on their respective Web sites. If you’re in the market
for a GPS receiver, these are excellent resources for comparing features and
seeing what the user interface is like because the manuals have instructions
as well as screenshots.
Friends with GPS receivers are also a good source of information; ask to take
their different brands and models out for a test drive.
Here are the two big questions that you should ask yourself before you begin
your GPS receiver search:
 What am I going to use it for? Think about what activities you’ll be
doing with your GPS receiver: hiking, biking, fishing, sales trips on the
road, and so on. What will you expect your GPS receiver to do? Navigate
streets or the wilderness, store favorite fishing spots, or find geocaches
(hidden goodies from the popular electronic treasure hunting sport of
geocaching)? When you get specific with your answers, you start to
identify features that your GPS receiver should have to meet your needs.
84
Part II: All About GPS 

 How much do I want to spend? How much money you’ve got in your
wallet or purse is obviously going to influence which models you end up
considering. The more features a GPS receiver has, the more it’s going to
cost. So if you can figure out exactly what you’re going to use the receiver
for (see the preceding bullet) as well as which features you really need
(versus those that are nice to have), you’ll end up saving some money.
Generally, figure on spending anywhere from a little under $100 to $500
for a handheld GPS receiver, although note that a few specialized auto-
motive and aviation models can cost up to $1,000.
For the most part, the cost of a GPS receiver really has nothing to do with
accuracy. An expensive GPS receiver isn’t more accurate than a cheaper
model. The only exceptions to this rule are GPS receivers that support Wide
Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which can be more accurate than GPS
receivers that don’t have these enhanced location features.
Figuring out how much you want to spend and what you want your GPS
receiver to do narrows your options considerably, but you’re likely still 
going to be faced with a number of choices. The next step is to narrow down
the list of candidates with some more questions and things to consider,
including
 Map display: Do you want to view maps on your GPS receiver? If so, you
definitely need a mapping model — a GPS receiver that displays maps.
See the later section, “To map or not to map.”
 Function: Will you use your GSP receiver primarily for road navigation or
outdoor recreation? Models are better suited for one or the other. See the
upcoming section, “Road warriors.”
 Accessories: Does your budget include accessories such as cases, cables,
vehicle mounting brackets, a case, and uploadable maps?
 Battery needs: Consider the following questions:
• How many hours does the GPS receiver run on a set of batteries?
Remember two things: Different models (and their features) have
different battery diets, and different battery types have varying life
spans. (See the upcoming section, “Battery basics,” for the skinny
on the different types of batteries and their life expectancy.)
• Will you need to carry spare batteries (always a good idea), and if
so, how many? I recommend always carrying at least one fresh set
of spare batteries.
• Will you be using a cigarette lighter power adapter as an alternative
to using batteries?
85
Chapter 5: Selecting and Getting Started with a GPS Receiver

 Memory: How much memory does the GPS receiver have and is it expand-
able? This is a critical question if you’re interested in a GPS receiver that
supports uploadable maps. Visit the GPS receiver manufacturer Web site
to get an idea of how much memory maps can take up. Or better yet,
check some of the Internet GPS information sources listed in Chapter 21,
where users talk about how much memory they need for loading differ-
ent types of maps.
 Display screen: Find out the following:
• How big is the screen and how well can you read it? Make sure to
consider visibility at night, in bright sunlight, and in poor weather
conditions. The size of the screen is directly related to the overall
size of the GPS receiver, so if you want a larger, more readable
screen, expect a larger GPS receiver to go with it.
• Do you really need a color screen? A color screen makes reading
maps easier because different colors are associated with map fea-
tures. Note: Color is more of a preference than a requirement.
 User interface: Does operating the GPS receiver make sense to you? Sure,
some learning is required to come up to speed, but using a GPS receiver
should mostly be intuitive. Be sure to compare different brands and
models because user interfaces are far from standardized.
 External controls: Look at different designs:
• Are the buttons and controls on the GPS receiver easy to use?
Naturally, this is also related to the user interface.
• Are the controls hard to operate while wearing gloves or mittens?
 Weight and size: Do you want absolutely the smallest package you can
get? Note that there’s only about a 7-ounce weight difference between
the lightest and heaviest handheld GPS receivers.
 Computer interface: Do you plan to connect your GPS receiver to a com-
puter to download and upload data? If so, make sure that the receiver can
interface with a computer to exchange data; I think this feature is a must
so you can upgrade the GPS receiver’s firmware. See Chapter 9 for more
details on connecting GPS receivers to computers.
To map or not to map
In terms of features, probably the biggest decision you’ll need to make is
whether to get a GPS receiver that displays maps. If you plan to use your GPS
receiver for on-the-road navigation, you need a mapping model. If you’re pri-
marily using your GPS receiver for outdoor activities, you need to decide
whether to spend the extra money and get a model that displays maps. Quite
honestly, no matter what a salesperson might tell you, a GPS receiver with
built-in maps isn’t required for activities such as hiking, geocaching, fishing,
bird watching, kayaking, or other outdoor pursuits. Using waypoints (see
86
Part II: All About GPS 

Chapter 4) and tracks are all you need to navigate and successfully stay
found. (Of course, you have a paper map and compass with you, and know
how to use them, right?) Even though your GPS receiver doesn’t display
maps, if it can interface with a PC, you can still download information on
where you’ve been and have it show up in a digital mapping program.
That said, mapping GPS receivers are pretty handy because they give you a
quick, big-picture view of where you’re located in relation to other features.
And just the sight of a map, even though it’s tiny and lacks a lot of detail, can
be pretty reassuring at times; even for a seasoned outdoors-person.
Although I’m a firm believer that a mapping GPS receiver should never take
the place of a paper map and compass, if your budget allows a mapping GPS
receiver along with the digital maps to load with it, I’d say buy it. I personally
use a mapping model for outdoor navigation and treat the map feature as just
another tool in my bag of navigation tricks. In Chapter 10, find out more about
the type of maps that you can use with GPS receivers.
Road warriors
If you’ll use your GPS receiver primarily in a car or truck for road navigation,
your feature criteria is a bit different than a GPS receiver designed primarily
for outdoor recreational use. Although any GPS receiver with a base map or
uploadable street maps can help you stay found on the road, some models are
more suited to automobile navigation. And although some GPS receivers are
designed primarily for automotive use, I prefer handheld GPS receivers that
offer versatility because they can be used in a car or for outdoor recreation.
Some important features to look for in a GPS receiver that you’re going to use
for road navigation include
 Automatic route selection: A GPS receiver designed for street navigation
allows you to find addresses, street intersections, and highway exits. Just
enter where you want to go, and the receiver calculates the shortest or
fastest way to get there. Pretty slick, isn’t it? The selected route is high-
lighted on the map screen, and your progress is displayed as you travel.
If you encounter a traffic jam or other road problem, you can instruct
the receiver to recalculate a new route from your present position and
avoid the problem.
 Turn here directions: The GPS receiver lists all the streets and roads in
your route at which you’ll need to make turns, including the street name,
an arrow that points to the correct turning direction, how far ahead the
turn is, and how long it’s going to take to arrive at the turn. The GPS
receiver gives an audible or visual signal prior to when you need to turn.
 Points of interest: Maps that are used with road navigation GPS receivers
have databases of information about gas stations, restaurants, freeway
exits, hotels, attractions, entertainment, shopping, and emergency 
87
Chapter 5: Selecting and Getting Started with a GPS Receiver

services along your route. These are dubbed Points of Interest (POIs); the
GPS receiver can display information about specific POIs.
 External antenna support: Because the metal body of a car or truck might
interfere with satellite signals, an external antenna might be required to
connect to the GPS receiver. An external antenna also provides you with
more mounting location options because only the antenna (and not the
GPS receiver) needs to be mounted someplace with a clear view of the
sky. Note: Some heated windshields can block satellite signals. In cases
like that, you’ll probably need to use an external antenna with a magnetic
roof mount.
If you’re a GPS road warrior, you’ll definitely want a 12-volt cigarette lighter
adapter so you don’t go through a lot of batteries during a trip.
And finally, if you’re more of an urbanite (versus an outdoors) adventurer,
another option is to use a PDA, such as a Pocket PC or Palm with GPS hard-
ware and street navigation software. Chapter 6 discusses the ins and outs of
using PDAs with GPS.
Matching GPS receiver features 
to your activities
Aside from a few portable, specialized, single-purpose automotive and avia-
tion GPS receivers, most GPS receivers are pretty versatile and can be used for
a wide range of activities. However, some features make some GPS receivers
more suited to certain activities than others.
Table 5-1 contains a list of activities in which people typically use GPS receivers
as well as a list of features that could be useful for each activity. Just remem-
ber that these features aren’t necessarily required and that a bare-bones GPS
receiver will serve you equally well for basic navigation needs.

GPS receivers that are advertised as waterproof typically comply with the IEC
(European Community Specification) Standard 529 IPX7. This standard states
a device can be immersed in up to one meter (a little over three feet) of water
for up to 30 minutes before failing. You can count on all handheld GPS receivers
to be weatherproof (moisture-resistant), but if I’m doing an activity where my
waterproof IPX7 GPS receiver might end up taking a dunking, I carry it in water-
proof bag that floats just for added security.
If you’re a pilot, you’ve probably figured out I don’t include much information
about GPS and flying in this book. If you want the lowdown on selecting and
using GPS receivers for aviation, check out www.cockpitgps.com. John Bell,
a commercial pilot, has written an excellent book — Cockpit GPS — that he
makes available as a shareware PDF file. Highly recommended.
After you narrow down your choices to a couple of different GPS receivers,
check out what people have to say about the models you’re considering.
Both www.amazon.com and http://reviews.cnet.com have lots of com-
ments from consumers who have purchased popular GPS receivers. Perform
a search for the manufacturer and model and read online feedback.
Becoming Familiar with Your 
New GPS Receiver
After considering all the options, making your list, checking it twice, and find-
ing out which GPS receivers are naughty and nice, you’ve finally come to that
blessed event where you’re the proud owner of a GPS receiver. But before you
step out the door for a 100-mile wilderness trek or cross-country road trip,
intent on relying on your new electronic gadget as a guide, be sure spend
some time getting to know your GPS receiver.
A good place to start your GPS familiarization process is with the user manual.
Many GPS receivers have a quick-start guide that gets you up and running in
a matter of minutes. These guides are perfect for those impatient, got-to-have-
it-now people; however, I suggest that you also take the time to read the full
user manual. Otherwise, you could miss out on some important information
contained in the full user manual.
In addition to the user manual, this section will also help you become familiar
with your GPS receiver so you can get the most out of it. Obviously, because
so many GPS receiver models are on the market, don’t expect to find detailed
operating procedures for your specific model here: You need your user manual
for that. What you can expect is basic information that applies to most GPS
receivers, including some things most user manuals don’t mention.

Chapter 5: Selecting and Getting Started with a GPS Receiver
Based on a number of years of search and rescue experience, I can list numer-
ous occasions when hunters and hikers thought that their GPS receiver was
some kind of magic talisman that would prevent them from getting lost. And
quite often when the search teams finally found them, they had no clue what-
soever how to properly use their GPS receiver. If you’re going to rely on a GPS
receiver for navigating outside of urban areas, take the time to find out how
to use it so the friendly, local search-and-rescue people don’t have to come
looking for you. I’ll step off my soapbox now, thank you.
Powering Your GPS Receiver
Before you can start using your GPS receiver, you obviously need to give it
some power. For portable GPS receivers, that usually means AA or AAA batter-
ies. Manufacturers all give estimated battery lifetimes for their GPS receivers,
but the actual number of hours a GPS receiver will run depends on how it’s
being used. For example, with the backlight on, battery life goes down because
more power is consumed. In addition, what type of batteries you’re using can
also make a difference.
Battery Tech 101
You can really get geeky with batteries and
powering your GPS unit. If you get a charge out
of electricity, here are some links to nitty-gritty
information sources that cover voltage, mil-
liamperes, and GPS drainage rates:

but you’ll find some good data on how 
different types of batteries perform.
 Newsgroups: sci.geo.satellite-nav.
Do a Google Groups search in this USENET
newsgroup for batteries and be prepared to
spend a couple of hours reading through
educational (and sometimes controversial)
posts.
When you check these sources, you’ll run into
mAh, which means milliampere-hours. Most
rechargeable batteries like NiMH have the mAh
rating printed on their label. This rating is the
battery capacity. Typically, the higher the mAh
number, the longer the battery will last.

Battery basics
Although batteries may have the same size and shape, they definitely don’t
perform the same. In Table 5-2 are the pluses and minuses of some of the dif-
ferent types of batteries that you can use with your GPS receiver.

of batteries.) When it comes to batteries and chargers, online prices are
almost always cheaper than full retail, so be sure to shop around.
93
Chapter 5: Selecting and Getting Started with a GPS Receiver
Battery saver mode
Some GPS receivers have a battery saver mode
that can greatly extend the life of your batteries.
(Check your user manual to see whether your
model has this feature and how to turn it on.)
Normally, a GPS receiver processes satellite
data every second and determines your speed
and location. Based on this information, the GPS
receiver predicts where you should be the next
time it gets satellite data. If the prediction is close
to your actual position and battery saver mode
is turned on, the GPS receiver will start receiv-
ing satellite signals every five seconds or so
instead of every second. In addition, some of the
internal electronics are turned off during this wait
period. Because a reduced amount of power is
needed, the battery life is extended.
The GPS receiver continues to access satellite
data every five seconds until the predicted loca-
tion isn’t accurate anymore, at which time it
switches back to receiving data every second,
starting the process over again. (Some GPS
receivers provide you with a number of choices
of how often satellite data is received. The 
more seconds, the more battery efficient the
receiver is.)

If you’re environmentally conscious or want to save some money over the
long term, use NiMH rechargeable batteries in your GPS receiver. Although a
charger and pack of batteries obviously cost more than disposable alkalines,
rechargeable batteries are a wise investment because they can be recharged
hundreds of times before they end up in a landfill.
Power to the people
After you select the type of batteries you’re going to use, you should be
aware of some other issues when it comes to powering GPS receivers:
 Battery life gauges: In the GPS receiver’s setup information page, you can
specify what type of battery you’re using, such as alkaline or NiMH. The
battery type setting helps the GPS receiver make an accurate guess how
long the battery will last. Remember that different battery types have
different discharge rates. All GPS receivers also have an onscreen battery
gauge that shows you how fully charged the batteries are. If you set the
wrong type, the worst that will happen is that the gauge won’t be accu-
rate. See how to extend battery life with some GPS receiver models in
the sidebar, “Battery saver mode.”
Always check the battery level of your GPS receiver before you head out
on a trip and also remember to carry spare batteries. One way to tell
which batteries are new or charged is to put a rubber band around the
good ones. By feeling around in your pack or pocket, you can instantly
tell which ones are fresh. Note: Rechargeable batteries discharge faster
than alkaline batteries when they’re not in use, so if you haven’t used your
GPS unit in a couple of months, don’t be surprised if those rechargeable
batteries are dead or don’t have much life left in them.
 Cigarette lighter adapters: If you’re primarily using your GPS receiver 
in a car or truck, you can save on battery costs by powering the GPS
receiver with a cigarette lighter adapter. These handy devices run a GPS
receiver from your car’s electrical system. You can buy a generic version
or one made for your model (sold by that GPS receiver manufacturer).
Depending on the model, adapters cost between $20–$40, with the generic
versions a bit cheaper than the manufacturer models.
Cigarette lighter power adapters have straight or coiled cables. Although
coiled cables are tidier, if your cigarette lighter isn’t close to the dash-
board, a coiled cable can pull your GPS receiver off the dashboard if 
it’s not securely mounted. Adapters with straight cables don’t have this
problem; you can tidy up any slack in the cable with a plastic zip tie.

Initializing Your GPS Receiver
Your GPS now has power, so it’s ready to go, right? Well, almost. After you put
batteries in your GPS receiver and turn it on for the first time, don’t expect it
to instantly display your location. A GPS receiver first needs to go through an
initialization process before it can tell you where you are. The type of initial-
ization and the amount of time it takes depends on what information the GPS
receiver has previously received from the satellites and when.
The process is mostly all automatic, and you don’t need to do much as your
GPS receiver starts up and begins to acquire satellites. Your GPS user manual
may contain model-specific initialization information.
To initialize a new GPS receiver, take it outside to someplace that has an unob-
structed view of the sky (such as a large field or a park) and turn on the power.
(You did install the batteries first, right?). After the start-up screen displays,
the receiver will begin trying to acquire satellites.
It can take anywhere from 5–30 minutes for the GPS receiver to gather enough
satellite data to get a position fix for the first time (usually more toward the 5
minutes end of the scale). Don’t worry; your GPS receiver isn’t going to be this
slow all the time. After the GPS receiver is first initialized, it usually only takes
15–45 seconds to lock on to the satellites when you turn it on in the future.
95
Chapter 5: Selecting and Getting Started with a GPS Receiver
GPS receiver initialization nitty-gritty
You really don’t need to know this technical infor-
mation to operate your GPS receiver, but to start
acquiring satellites to get an accurate location fix,
a GPS receiver needs the following satellite data:
 A current almanac (rough positions of all the
satellites in orbit)
 The GPS receiver’s current location
 The current date and time
 Ephemeris data (precise position of individ-
ual satellites)
If some or all the data is missing or out-of-date,
the GPS receiver needs to get updated informa-
tion from the satellites before it can accurately fix
a current position. The types of data that are out-
of-date or missing determine how long the GPS
receiver takes to initialize. If the GPS receiver is
brand new, out of the box, several hundred miles
away from where it was last used, or has been
stored for a prolonged period of time, initializa-
tion will take longer.

In order to speed up the location fix for the first time or when the GPS receiver
has been moved hundreds of miles since it was last turned on, many GPS
receivers have an option where you move a cursor on an onscreen map of
the United States or world to show your general location. Providing a general
location helps the GPS receiver narrow its search for satellites that are visible
from your present location, speeding up the initialization process.
Manufacturers often use the terms cold start and warm start to describe differ-
ent GPS receiver start-up states and times. Unfortunately, their definitions of
these terms can be different, which makes comparative information about
start times not very useful. Just remember that under the same conditions,
with a similar view of the sky and with their antennas optimally orientated,
most modern GPS receivers generally take the same amount of time to acquire
satellites and fix a location.
Most GPS receivers have a satellite status page that’s displayed while the
receiver is acquiring satellites; see an example status page in Figure 5-1. This
page typically consists of two circles that represent a dome of sky above your
head. The outer circle is the horizon, the inner circle is 45 degrees above the
horizon, and the center of the inner circle is directly overhead. The N on the
page represents north.
Based on the almanac information, the GPS receiver shows the position of
satellites within the circles, representing them with numbers. As a signal
from a satellite is acquired, the number is highlighted or bolded.
Underneath the circles are a series of bar graphs with numbers underneath
them that represent signal strength. The numbers correspond to the satel-
lites that the GPS receiver has located. The more a bar is filled in, the better
the GPS receiver is receiving signals from that particular satellite.

Chapter 5: Selecting and Getting Started with a GPS Receiver
Trimble planning software
During certain times of the day, you might have
better satellite coverage than at other times
because of the number of satellites that are in
view and the position of a single satellite rela-
tive to the GPS receiver and other satellites in
the constellation.
Trimble Navigation (www.trimble.com), one
of the largest manufacturers of commercial and
professional GPS receivers, has a free Windows
program called Planning, shown in the figure
here. Planning is designed for surveyors who
need to know when the best time is to use GPS
surveying instruments. Just enter the latitude
and longitude coordinates of a location and the
date, and Planning gives you information on
 DOP: Dilution of Precision describes how
accurate a reported GPS position is. The
smaller the DOP number, the higher the
accuracy.
 Satellites: You can see how many satellites
are in view if the sky is unobstructed, the opti-
mum times of satellite visibility, and the satel-
lite orbit paths.
You don’t need to be a surveyor to use this infor-
mation. Knowing optimal GPS times is useful for
all sorts of outdoor activities. For example, if
you’re serious about geocaching, you can select
the best time of day to look for caches when
your GPS receiver gives you the most accuracy.
Planning is easy to use and works for any loca-
tion in the world with all the GPS satellite infor-
mation presented in graphs or lists.
To download Planning, go to www.trimble.
com/planningsoftware_ts.asp?Nav=
Collection-8425.

Try moving your GPS receiver to watch the satellite signal strength change. If
signals are weak or you get a message about poor satellite coverage, move to
another location and change the position of the receiver to better align it with
the satellites that are shown onscreen. If you’re successful, you’ll see new
satellites acquired, the signal strength increase, or both. The more satellites
you acquire and the stronger the signals, the more accurate your receiver is.
Holding the GPS receiver properly will optimize signal reception. If your GPS
receiver has a patch antenna, hold it face up, parallel to the ground. If your
GPS receiver has a quad helix antenna, hold it straight up so that the top of
the receiver is pointing toward the sky. Chapter 3 covers the differences
between patch and quad helix antennas.
After the GPS receiver gets enough information from the satellites to fix your
location, the screen typically displays an Estimated Position Error (EPE)
number. Based on the satellite data received, this is the estimated error for
the current position. The smaller the number displayed, which will be in feet
or meters, the more accurate your position.
Estimated Position Error (EPE) is a bit confusing. If you see an EPE of 20 feet, it
doesn’t mean that you’re within 20 feet of the actual coordinates. You’re actu-
ally within up to two times the distance of the EPE (or even more) from the
actual location. For example, if you have an EPE of 50, your location could be
1–100 feet of the actual coordinates. EPE is not a maximum distance away from
the actual location; it’s only a measurement estimate based on available satel-
lite data. To complicate things even further, different GPS receiver manufactur-
ers use different formulas for determining EPE, so if you set three different GPS
receiver brands next to each other, they all display different EPE numbers.
Some manufacturers are conservative with their numbers, and others are opti-
mistic. Don’t get too caught up with EPE numbers; just treat them as ballpark
estimates — and remember, the smaller the number, the better.
Changing Receiver Settings
After you initialize your GPS receiver for the first time, you need to change a
few of the receiver’s default system settings. You only need to do this once,
and a few GPS receivers will prompt you to make some of these changes as
part of the initialization process. These changes are mostly to customize set-
tings based on your location and needs. Check your user manual for specific
information on how to change the system settings described below. An exam-
ple of a GPS receiver system settings page is shown in Figure 5-2.
98
Part II: All About GPS 

Although GPS receivers have a number of system settings that you can change,
here are some of the important settings you’ll want to initially adjust:
 Time: Your GPS receiver gets very precise time data from atomic clocks
aboard the satellites, but it’s up to you how the time will be displayed.
You need to specify
• Whether to use 24-hour (military time) or 12-hour (AM and PM) time
• Whether Daylight Savings Time is automatically turned on and off
• What your time zone is (or your offset from UTC)
Your GPS receiver gets time data from the satellites in the UTC format.
UTC stands for Coordinated Universal Time (no, the acronym doesn’t
match the meaning), an international time standard. UTC is a time scale
kept by laboratories around the world, using highly precise atomic clocks.
The International Bureau of Weights and Measures uses time data col-
lected from the labs to establish UTC, which is accurate to approximately
one nanosecond (about a billionth of a second) per day. In 1986, UTC
replaced Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) as the world time standard. The
Greenwich meridian (prime meridian, or zero degrees longitude) is the
starting point of every time zone in the world. GMT is the mean time that
the earth takes to rotate from noon to the following noon. These observa-
tions have been kept since 1884 at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich,
England. In hours, minutes, and seconds, UTC and GMT always have the
same values.
 Units of measure: Your GPS receiver can display distance information in
statute (such as feet and miles), nautical (knots), or metric (meters and
kilometers) formats. The default setting for GPS units sold in the United
States is statute, so unless you’re boating or want to use the more logical
metric system, leave the setting as-is.
 Coordinate system: By default, your GPS receiver displays positions in
latitude and longitude. If you want to use location coordinates in a differ-
ent format, now’s the time to change the setting.
Figure 5-2:

tings page

99
Chapter 5: Selecting and Getting Started with a GPS Receiver

 Datum: The default datum for all GPS receivers is WGS 84. Unless you’re
planning on using your receiver with maps that have a different datum,
leave the default setting. (See Chapter 4 for more information on types
of datums and their impact GPS position coordinates.)
 Battery type: The default battery setting on most GPS receivers is alka-
line. If you’re using another type of battery, select the correct type. The
battery type setting doesn’t affect the GPS receiver’s operation; it only
ensures that the battery life is correctly displayed on the screen because
different types of batteries have different power characteristics.
 Language: Most GPS receivers are multilingual, so if you’d rather view the
user interface in a language other than English, it’s as simple as selecting
a different language from a menu.
Using Your GPS Receiver
Finally! After you initialize your GPS receiver and change some of the system
settings, it’s time to use it. Start with
 Going through the GPS receiver’s different onscreen pages and see what
information is displayed.
 Walking around and watching what happens to the numbers and your
position on the GPS receiver’s mapping and trip pages. (Do this outside,
of course.)
 Pressing buttons and seeing what happens. You may want to have your
user manual nearby in case you get lost between information screens.
GPS receivers are pretty robust, and you’re not going to hurt your new pur-
chase by being curious.
GPS receiver screens can be scratched relatively easily. Investing in a carrying
case will keep the screen scratch-free; many cases have a clear plastic face that
allows you to use and view the GPS without taking it out of the case. Another
way to keep the screen from being scratched is to buy thin, clear plastic sheets
used to protect PDA screens, cut them to shape, and place the sheet on top
of the GPS receiver screen.
The following are some simple exercises you can try that will help you become
familiar with your GPS receiver. When you first start using your GPS receiver,
take the user manual with you. If you forget how to do something or have a
question, the manual will be right there for reference.

Part II: All About GPS 

Coming home
Everyone has opinions and like to know where people stand on different
things, so here’s an exercise to let you know exactly where you stand — 
when you’re outside your backdoor.
1. Take your GPS receiver outside where you live and create a waypoint
for the spot where you’re standing.
See Chapter 4 for the skinny on creating waypoints.
2. Name the waypoint HOME.
3. Turn the GPS receiver off and go for a walk.
How far is up to you, but at least travel far enough that you can see your
starting point.
4. When you’re ready to head back home, turn the GPS receiver back on
and use it to navigate back to the HOME waypoint.
Be sure to move through the different onscreen pages to watch the direc-
tion and distance change as you head back home.
After you enter the HOME waypoint, no matter where you are, if you have
your GPS receiver with you, you can always tell exactly how far away home
is. Remember, this is in a straight line as the crow flies unless you’ve got a
GPS receiver that supports autorouting.
How far, how fast?
Your GPS receiver also contains a very accurate trip computer that displays
information about distance, speed, and time. After you read your user manual
on how to reset and start the trip computer, here are some ideas for getting
familiar with how it works:
 When exercising: When you run, jog, bike, or whatever, take your GPS
receiver with you on your favorite course to see just how far you go. At
the end, check your average and maximum speed. (Chapter 23 is filled
with tips on using GPS if you’re an athlete.)
 When on walks: If you have children and they walk to school, go with
them on their route to see exactly how far it is. (And then tell them you
used to have to walk at least ten times that distance . . . in the snow . . .
uphill both ways . . . when you were young.)
 When doing lawn work: The next time you cut the grass, take your GPS
receiver with you and see just how far you push your lawn mower.

Chapter 5: Selecting and Getting Started with a GPS Receiver

Finding your ancestors
A lot of people are into genealogy these days, and your GPS receiver can be a
helpful tool in tracking your ancestors. When you visit a cemetery looking for
long-lost kin, bring your GPS receiver with you to record the exact locations
of tombstones and grave plots. You can pass the latitude and longitude on to
other relatives doing their own genealogical research. The coordinates can
be extremely useful for someone locating a small out-of-the-way cemetery in
the countryside, or a relative buried in a cemetery with thousands of plots.
Simulating navigation
Some GPS receivers have a simulator or demonstration mode. This is proba-
bly one of the most overlooked (but coolest) features on a GPS receiver. The
simulator mode acts as if the receiver is actually acquiring GPS satellite infor-
mation. You select a speed and a direction, and the GPS receiver pretends
you’re moving. Because the receiver isn’t relying on acquiring satellite data,
you can comfortably sit inside the house in your favorite chair, getting famil-
iar with your new purchase.
Depending on where you live or work, how many windows you have, and
your view of the sky, your GPS receiver might (might) work indoors (or at
least close to windows). Although you’re limited to what you can do with a
GPS receiver indoors, it’s fun to see just how much GPS coverage you can get
walking around inside a building.
There are lots more things you can do with a GPS receiver besides using it for
basic navigation. Think outside the box. Some examples include
 Take digital pictures of cool places and record their coordinates with your
GPS receiver. You can post them on a Web site or e-mail them to friends.
 If you have a small GPS receiver (like a Garmin Geko), securely attach it
to your dog’s collar and track where Fido goes for the day. (You can also
find commercial GPS pet locator products on the market.)
 Use your track log to create art. Some GPS users express themselves as
artists by using their GPS receiver to record their movements as they walk
around trying to create shapes or pictures. (Don’t believe me? Check out
www.gpsdrawing.com.)
Your goal should be to become confident using your GPS receiver and to
have fun in the process.

Using GPS with a PDA
In This Chapter
 Discovering the different types of PDA GPS systems
 Understanding the advantages and disadvantages to using PDAs
 Interfacing GPS receivers to PDAs
 Selecting GPS mapping software for your PDA
P
ersonal digital assistants (PDAs), such as a Pocket PC or Palm, are a
popular way of accessing GPS information. The PDA processes satellite
data from a GPS receiver and then displays your current location in a map-
ping program.
You can use many different types of GPS receivers with PDAs, including hand-
held, mouse, wireless, and card. This chapter helps you navigate through the
PDA/GPS maze by reviewing the different hardware and software options and
comparing common, handheld GPS receivers (such as those discussed in
Chapter 5) with PDAs that use GPS. I start things off by discussing some of
the advantages and disadvantages of PDA-based navigation systems.
Choosing between a GPS 
Receiver and a PDA
You might wonder why anyone would you want to use a PDA instead of a
handheld, consumer GPS receiver. That’s a very good question; you gadget
junkies out there who have your hands raised and are answering, “Because
it’s cool,” please put your hands down and continue reading.
You’ll find compelling advantages and disadvantages to using a PDA with GPS
that are based on your intended use and needs. To see whether you should
even be considering a PDA navigation system, review some of the pros and
cons right from the start.

PDA advantages
Aside from being cool, a PDA might make sense for you as part of a personal
navigation system for a number of reasons. Some of the advantages include
 Larger screens: PDAs have larger, higher-resolution, color screens com-
pared with handheld GPS receivers. This is a big plus if your eyesight isn’t
as good as it used to be — and it’s really important if you’re using the
PDA while driving. You want to be able to quickly glance at a map on the
screen, determine your location, and then get your eyes back on the road.
 More maps: Most of the maps that you can upload to GPS receivers don’t
have a lot of detail; especially the topographic maps. These maps tend
to be vector line maps and don’t have the resolution or detail found on
paper maps that you’d use for hiking. Several mapping programs are avail-
able for PDAs that support all types of maps, and you can even create
your own custom maps. With a PDA, you can use more detailed maps, like
scanned, color 1:24,000 topographic maps. Bonus: You’re not locked in to
using only a GPS receiver manufacturer’s proprietary software and maps.
 Expandable memory: Unlike many GPS receivers, which have fixed
amounts of memory, most PDAs support expandable memory with 
plug-in memory cards. The only limitation to the number of the maps
and amount of data that you can store is the size of the memory card.
 Usability: Although handheld GPS receivers are fairly easy to use, the
user interfaces found on PDAs are even simpler. Using a touch screen
and stylus to enter data and commands is a lot faster and easier than
using the buttons on a handheld GPS receiver.
 Custom programs: Developers can easily write custom programs for
PDAs that access the data output from a GPS receiver. If you’re collect-
ing information that’s based on location data, this can make your job
much easier than pressing buttons on a GPS receiver and then hand-
writing remarks in a field notebook.
 PDA features: PDAs have all sorts of useful programs such as address
books, contact lists, and databases designed for readily storing data. 
A fair amount of this information tends to be location based (like
addresses), and having a single information/navigation device is the
definition of practical.
PDA disadvantages
After reading through advantages of using a PDA as your navigation system of
choice, you’re probably sold on a using a PDA. However, they definitely aren’t
for everyone. Some of downsides include
106
Part II: All About GPS 

 Ruggedness: Handheld GPS receivers are designed to take more abuse
than PDAs, which often fail when they’re dropped or knocked around.
Although you can buy ruggedized (with special enclosures that make
them waterproof, drop-proof, bear-proof, and kid-proof) PDAs, they’re
considerably more expensive than off-the-shelf models; expect to spend
at least several hundred dollars more.
 Weather/water resistance: Unlike GPS receivers, PDAs aren’t designed
to be waterproof or even weatherproof. This can be a major issue if you
plan on using your PDA navigation system outdoors in damp, rainy, or
snowy weather, you’re around water, or you have a leaky water bottle in
your backpack.
 Power considerations: Most PDAs use internal batteries that are
recharged through a docking cradle. If you’re away from a power source,
this can be a serious issue because you can’t swap out dead or dying
batteries for a convenient set of spare AA or AAA batteries like you can
with a handheld GPS receiver.
When it comes to weighing the pros and cons of PDA navigation systems, you
really have to examine your needs and planned use. If you plan on using a
GPS receiver exclusively for road navigation, you should definitely consider a
PDA. However if you’re going to be using GPS primarily in an outdoor setting,
you’re probably better off with a handheld GPS receiver.
107
Chapter 6: Using GPS with a PDA
OtterBoxes
Although PDAs are relatively fragile and don’t
get along well with water, you can find products
on the market to protect them when exposed to
harsh environments. Among my favorites are
OtterBox cases. For a well-spent $20–25 for the
lower-end models, these plastic containers
defend a PDA or other electronic devices from
Mother Nature as well as not-too-careful
owners.
OtterBox has two products that let you operate a
PDA (including using its stylus) while encased in
a waterproof and crushproof housing. One model,
the Armor 3600 shown in the figure here, has a
waterproof portal that allows you to connect the
PDA to an external GPS receiver with a serial
cable. There are also accessories that accom-
modate the oversize external antennas of GPS
receiver cards and sleeves. Tests performed by
the U.S. Forest Service indicated no satellite
signal degradation when GPS receivers were
used in the Armor cases.
The Armor series of cases do add bulk to the size
of your PDA. However, considering the protection
that they offer, the rugged cases are well suited
for anyone who wants to venture out into the
wilds and use a PDA without worrying about it
breaking. A 3600 Armor model will set you back
about $100; OtterBox also has other Armor cases
from $20–50.
I like to think of the OtterBox Armor products as
accessories that turn your meek and mild PDA
into a tough and rugged Humvee. To find out more
about the products, check out www.otter
box.com.

If you’re leaning toward a PDA navigation system (or already have one) and
want to operate it out in the elements, at least buy an OtterBox or some type
of protective bag. See the sidebar, “OtterBoxes.” (I also like the Voyageur
waterproof and padded bags, see http://voyageur-gear.com for product
details.) I guarantee that your repair and replacement bills will be consider-
ably less compared with stowing your PDA in a jacket pocket.
Interfacing Your PDA to a GPS Receiver
If you’ve decided that a PDA navigation system meets your needs (or maybe
you just love cool high-tech toys), the first step is to decide how you’re going
to use to get GPS data into your PDA. Options for doing so include
 Handheld GPS receivers connected to the PDA with a serial (or USB)
cable.
 Mouse GPS receivers (a GPS receiver with no display screen and a serial
or USB cable).
 GPS receivers built into PC or memory cards.
 GPS receiver sleeves (expansion devices that slide on the back of certain
models of PDAs).
 Wireless GPS receivers that transmit data with Bluetooth radio signals.
Read more about these in the upcoming section, “Bluetooth GPS
receivers.”
 Integrated GPS receivers built directly into a PDA.
I’m assuming you already have a PDA or are currently shopping for one and
have a pretty good idea what you’re going to buy. It’s outside the scope of
this book to make suggestions on which PDA you should use. (Plus I’m not
going to pick sides in the Palm versus Pocket PC brand-loyalty wars.) Just
keep in mind that most PDAs can be interfaced with a GPS receiver one way
or another.
Look at the types of GPS receivers you can use with a PDA. Most of the GPS
receivers designed for use with PDAs cost as much as low-end to mid-range
handheld GPS receivers. Some also work with laptop computers, which pro-
vide the ultimate big-screen GPS display.
Handheld GPS receivers
If your PDA has a serial port, you can easily interface the PDA to a general pur-
pose, handheld GPS receiver. Most of the information on connecting a personal
computer to a GPS receiver that I discuss in Chapter 9 also applies to PDAs.
108
Part II: All About GPS 

Because you’re using the handheld GPS receiver exclusively as a data input
source — and really don’t care about what’s appearing on its screen — just
about any GPS receiver that can communicate with a computer via a serial
port will fit the bill. You don’t need a lot of features and whistles and bells on
the GPS receiver if you’re primarily using it this way. This option makes a lot
of sense because the GPS receiver can be used independently of the PDA,
especially outdoors during bad weather.
The primary disadvantage is that you have to contend with two electronic
devices and the cable that connects them together. This can sometimes get a
bit messy in a car, with hardware and power and interface cables scattered
all over your dashboard. Also, this type of PDA navigation setup is a bit cum-
bersome to deal with if you’re walking around.
One of the best sources of GPS receiver interface cables for a wide variety 
of PDAs is Pc-Mobile. Check out its extensive product Web site at http://
pc-mobile.net.
Mouse GPS receivers
GPS receivers that don’t have a display screen but connect to a computer with
a serial or USB cable are often called mouse receivers because of their resem-
blance to a computer mouse. A mouse GPS receiver acts as an input device
for a PDA or laptop and only sends satellite data that it’s currently receiving.
109
Chapter 6: Using GPS with a PDA
GPS and cellphones
You can’t talk about PDAs and GPS without men-
tioning cellular phones, especially as features
and functionality of the two electronic devices
start to converge.
GPS will play a large role in the future of cell-
phones. The U.S. government has mandated
that calls placed by cellphones to 911 emergency
operators must reveal where the call was made,
just like landline telephones. This new program
works by either triangulating a mobile phone’s
position via cellular phone network antenna
towers or with a GPS receiver built into the cell-
phone that transmits its location.
In 2003, the first GPS-enabled cellular phones
started to appear on the U.S. market. Phones like
the Motorola i730, i88, and i58sr cell phones all
have GPS receivers built inside them and are
capable of broadcasting their location. Internet
sites and tracking software are available that can
provide you with the location of a GPS-enabled
phone that’s subscribed to a location reporting
service.
As GPS-enabled phones start to become more
common, it’s only a matter of time before navi-
gation and map programs start to appear on the
phones, which will bring a whole new meaning
to using your phone to get directions.

Mouse GPS receivers are about half the size of the smallest handheld GPS
receivers (Figure 6-1 shows the size differences between several GPS receivers),
but even so still have good satellite reception with open skies. Another advan-
tage to a mouse GPS receiver is you can place it in an optimal spot on your
car’s dashboard for satellite reception and then mount the PDA in the most
visible place for driving. Depending on the model and type, a mouse GPS
receiver can be powered by a cigarette lighter adapter, rechargeable batter-
ies, or the device it’s plugged in to.
Although mouse GPS receivers are smaller than handheld GPS receivers, you
still face the cable clutter issue, plus you can’t use the mouse receiver to get
satellite data unless it’s connected to a PDA or laptop.
Some of the vendors of mouse GPS receivers (and their Web sites where you
can get product information) include
 DeLorme: www.delorme.com
 Haicom: www.haicom.com.tw
 Holux: www.holux.com
 Mapopolis: www.mapopolis.com
GPS receiver cards
Some GPS receivers take the form of a card that you can plug into a PDA
expansion slot. The two types of GPS receiver cards are
 Memory cards: Most PDAs have a memory card slot that supports a
Compact Flash (CF) or Secure Digital (SD) type of memory card. Both of
these card formats also support hardware devices that can be embed-
ded into the card: in this case, a GPS receiver. (PDAs without internal
memory card slots might have optional expansion packs that plug into
the PDA and provide a memory card slot.)
 PC Cards: A PC Card (also called a PCMCIA card) is a hardware expansion
card designed for laptops. PC Card devices include hard drives, modems,
and GPS receivers. These receiver cards are mostly used with laptops,
but some PDAs support expansion packs for using PC Card devices.
Using a GPS receiver card with your PDA means that you don’t need to worry
about an external GPS receiver or cables. You just plug the card into a slot, and
the GPS receiver starts accessing satellite data. However, note these drawbacks:
 Slot competition: CF and SD memory cards that function as GPS receivers
take up the expansion slot that’s used for additional PDA memory.
 Battery hogs: GPS receiver cards quickly run down your PDA’s battery if
you’re not connected to an external power source.

GPS receiver sleeves
Certain models of iPAQ Pocket PCs and Palm OS PDAs have a proprietary
expansion slot into which you can plug hardware devices. These add-on
pieces of hardware are often called sleeves because they fit around the PDA.
See a GPS receiver sleeve in Figure 6-2.
The same advantages and disadvantages found with GPS receiver cards
(they’re convenient but can run down the PDA’s battery quickly) also apply
to GPS sleeves. Additionally, a sleeve adds a lot of bulk to the size of a nor-
mally slim PDA.
The main producer of Pocket PC and Palm sleeves is Navman. Expect to
spend around $200–$250 for a GPS sleeve. Find more about these products 
at www.navman.com.

Chapter 6: Using GPS with a PDA

Bluetooth GPS receivers
If your PDA supports Bluetooth (a wireless communication standard; www.
bluetooth.com), you have yet another GPS receiver option. Bluetooth GPS
receivers are pretty slick because they don’t
 Rely on the PDA’s batteries for power
They have their own power source and will run from 6–10 hours when
fully charged, depending on the model.
 Use up one of the PDA’s expansion slots
 Need cables that can get all tangled up
Bluetooth devices have about a 30-foot range, and the GPS receiver can
be placed in an optimal position on the dashboard to receive satellite
signals.
Just place your Bluetooth GPS receiver (about the size of a mouse GPS
receiver) anywhere with an open view of the sky, and it will broadcast GPS
data to your Bluetooth-enabled PDA. (If you have an older PDA that doesn’t
support Bluetooth, there are Bluetooth receivers that plug into your PDA’s
memory card slot.)
Many of the companies that manufacture GPS receiver cards, listed previ-
ously, also make Bluetooth GPS receivers. Some other companies that offer
Bluetooth receivers include

For outdoor use, you can easily mount your Bluetooth GPS receiver on a high
spot, such as on top of a pack (or some other location that’s in an optimal posi-
tion to receive satellite signals) and wirelessly record GPS data with your PDA.
OtterBox also makes waterproof cases for Bluetooth GPS receivers that don’t
degrade the transmitted radio signals so you can create a rugged wireless PDA
navigation system for use in harsh conditions. (See the sidebar, “OtterBoxes.”)

including reviews and detailed specifications, check out www.gpspassion.
com/en/hardware/gpslist.htm.
GPS-integrated PDAs
The most expensive option when creating a PDA navigation system is to pur-
chase a PDA that comes with a built-in GPS receiver. In 2003, Garmin intro-
duced the iQue 3600, a PDA that runs the Palm OS and features an integrated
GPS receiver.
The iQue 3600 looks like a normal PDA but has a flip-up, adjustable antenna
that pops out of the top. It has extensive mapping capabilities, including turn-
by-turn voice directions and integration with the calendar and address book
programs in which you can click an address and get instant directions. For
more information about the iQue 3600, visit www.garmin.com.
If the iQue becomes popular, look for other integrated GPS PDAs to be
released by Garmin and other manufacturers in the future; especially as GPS
receiver components become smaller and cheaper. As this book went to
press, Taiwanese manufacturer MiTAC announced the Mio 168, an integrated
GPS/Pocket PC.
Reviewing PDA Mapping Software
If you buy a GPS receiver specifically designed for PDA use, it will probably
come bundled with mapping software that includes map data and a program
that displays the maps and interfaces with the GPS receiver.
In addition to the program that runs on your PDA is a program that runs on
your PC; this program installs the maps on your PDA and can be used for
route planning. You select the maps that you want to install on your PC and
113
Chapter 6: Using GPS with a PDA

then upload the selected map data to your PDA. Because the maps are typi-
cally stored in the PDA’s memory card, the more memory you have, the more
maps you’ll be able to use.
Most PDA navigation software is designed for street navigation (see Figure 6-3
for screenshot of a typical PDA street map program), and has features for get-
ting around on roads and highways, including
 Autorouting: By inputting starting- and ending-point addresses, the map
program creates a route for you to follow to reach your destination. (You
usually can choose between fastest or shortest routes.) The route is out-
lined on the map, and the program also provides turn-by-turn directions
to get to your destination.
 POI data: In addition to maps, most programs have extensive databases
of POIs (Points of Interest) information, including gas stations, restau-
rants, shopping locations, and other useful travel data. POIs appear as
icons on the map that you can click to get more information. You can
also search for specific POIs by geographic location.
 Real-time tracking: When your PDA is connected to a GPS receiver, an
arrow moves on the screen, giving you real-time information about your
current position as well as displaying where you’ve been.
 Voice prompts: In addition to displaying turn-by-turn directions on the
screen, many programs provide voice prompts that tell you when to
make turns to reach your final destination. This is a nice safety feature
because you can pay more attention to the road and less attention to the
PDA screen.

A number of PDA mapping programs are on the market, and I could easily
devote an entire book to discussing them all. Because this chapter provides
only a general review of using PDAs with GPS, Table 6-1 lists of some of the
more popular PDA mapping programs; including which types of PDAs they
work with and a Web site address to get more product information. Most of
these programs are sold individually or might come bundled with a GPS
receiver. Expect to pay anywhere between $40–$150 for a software package.

One of the challenges in using a PDA in a car is dealing with the stylus. It can be
quite a coordination test holding the stylus in your hand, tapping commands
on the PDA with it, and driving at the same time. One slick solution is the
Stinger Stylus, which is a cross between a plastic ring and an artificial finger-
nail. Just slip the Stinger over your finger, and your fingertip takes the place of
a stylus. For more information on the Stinger, go to www.stingerstylus.com.
Most of the software and maps that come bundled with the PDA GPS receivers
are designed for road navigation. But what if you want to display topographic
or nautical charts on your PDA or use real-time GPS tracking off the road?
You’re in luck because several PDA programs fill this need. Topographic map
display is one area that PDA mapping software far exceeds handheld mapping
GPS receivers. Your PDA can display full-color, detailed 1:24,000 scale maps
that look exactly like the USGS paper versions. Compared with the 1:100,000
scale vector maps typically used on mapping GPS receivers, there’s no com-
parison when it comes to the amount of map detail that a PDA can display.
115
Chapter 6: Using GPS with a PDA

If your journeys take you off the beaten path, here are four products you
should be aware of:
 FUGAWI: FUGAWI was one of the first Windows desktop mapping pro-
grams and now works with Pocket PCs and Palms. The product comes
bundled with U.S. street maps and nautical charts, or you can import
maps of your own, such as USGS Digital Raster Graphics topographic
maps. For additional product details, go to www.fugawi.com.
 Maptech Outdoor Navigator: The Maptech Outdoor Navigator is unique.
Instead of being bundled with map data or requiring you to create your
own maps, (with purchase) you receive a year-long subscription to
download all the USGS topographic maps and NOAA nautical charts that
you want from Maptech’s Internet servers. Nice. Versions of Outdoor
Navigator are available for Pocket PCs and Palms. You can find more
about the product at www.maptech.com.
 SkyEye: This is a slick shareware Pocket PC program that displays aerial
photographs and topographic maps that you can download from the
Internet or create on your own. The program also interfaces with Garmin
GPS receivers to provide real-time mapping capabilities. For more about
SkyEye’s features, visit www.etree.com/tech/notsofreestuff/skyeye/
index.html.
 TeleType GPS: Although originally designed for street navigation,
TeleType’s PDA mapping program supports importing aerial pho-
tographs and digital maps from the TerraServer-USA Web site. For 
more information on the software, visit www.teletype.com.
 OziExplorerCE: OziExplorerCE is a Pocket PC version of the popular
OziExplorer mapping program. The CE version allows you to import
maps that you’ve created with OziExplorer on your PC to your PDA. See
a review of the PC version OziExplorer in Chapter 15. For more informa-
tion on the CE edition, go to www.oziexplorer.com.
Here are several excellent Internet resources that can provide you with more
information:
 Dale DePriest’s Navigation and GPS Articles: Dale DePriest is a longtime
contributor to the sci.geo.satellite-nav USENET newsgroup and the
comprehensive gpsinformation.net Web site. He has a considerable
amount of practical information on using Palms, Pocket PCs, and GPS at
www.gpsinformation.org/dale.

P
robably the fastest way for you to get real-world experience with your
GPS unit is by going geocaching. This new, high-tech sport gets you out
of the house and into the fresh air as you use both the computer in your GPS
unit and also the one in your head to find hidden treasure. Geocaching is a
fun and challenging activity that combines modern technologies like GPS and
the Internet, with primitive outdoor navigation and search skills that people
have been using for thousands of years. The sport also gives you a good
reason to visit places you’ve never been.
Geocaching is pronounced GEE-oh-cash-ing. Don’t pronounce cache as ca-
shay, even if you’re French. Unless you want funny looks, stick with cash.
Geocaching: The High-Tech 
Scavenger Hunt
When the U.S. government turned off GPS Selective Availability (SA) in May
2000, it was like magic. Suddenly civilian GPS receivers that were formerly

accurate to about 300 feet were accurate to 30 feet. This level of accuracy
offered some creative possibilities. Three days after SA was turned off, the
following message appeared in the sci.geo.satellite-nav USENET 
newsgroup:
From: Dave (news2yousNOneSPAM@hotmail.com.invalid)
Subject: GPS Stash Hunt... Stash #1 is there!
Newsgroups: sci.geo.satellite-nav
Date: 2000/05/03
Well, I did it, created the first stash hunt stash and here
are the coordinates:
N 45 17-460
W122 24.800
Lots of goodies for the finders. Look for a black plastic
bucket buried most of the way in the ground. Take
some stuff, leave some stuff! Record it all in the
log book. Have Fun!
Stash contains: DeLorme Topo USA software, videos, books,
food, money, and a slingshot!
Earlier that day, in the same newsgroup, Dave Ulmer had proposed a world-
wide stash hunt, where people would post GPS waypoints on the Internet to
lead searchers to hidden goodies. While Ulmer envisioned thousands of
stashes tucked in places all over the world, he had no idea how popular his
idea would become.
Starting with a humble little bucket full of goodies in Oregon, Ulmer’s idea took
off like wildfire. Within weeks, caches were hidden in Washington, Kansas,
California, New Zealand, Australia, and Chile. A newsgroup and Web site that
hosted the coordinates of the stashes soon popped up as the word started to
get around.

Part II: All About GPS 
The original caches: letterboxes
The whole geocaching concept isn’t that new.
Over 100 years ago, something similar developed
in England: letterboxing. Letterboxing comprises
placing a blank logbook and a custom-made
rubber stamp in a waterproof container and
then hiding it. Clues are distributed with the
container’s location, and searchers armed with
inkpads and notebooks try to find the hidden box.
If they are successful, they stamp the logbook
in the box with their own personal rubber stamp
and also stamp their logbook with the box’s
stamp. This low-tech version of geocaching is still
very popular. Depending on whom you talk to,
10,000–40,000 letterboxes are hidden in England,
and around 5,000 are lurking in the United States.
Read more about letterboxing at www.letter
boxing.org.

By the end of May, in a Yahoo! Group devoted to the new sport, member Matt
Stum suggested that the sport be called geocaching in order to avoid some of
the negative connotations associated with drugs and word stash. (A cache is a
hidden place where goods or valuables are concealed.) Geocaching had a nice
ring to it, and it didn’t sound like a bad Cheech and Chong movie.
Today, geocaching has grown popular, and the rules are still pretty much the
same: Take some stuff, leave some stuff, record it in the logbook, and have fun!
Relatively cheap and accurate GPS receivers and widespread Internet access
have helped the sport flourish. As of November 2003, the www.geocaching.
com site (currently the largest geocaching site on the Net) had over 72,500
active caches in 188 countries listed in its database. That’s a lot of caches out
there to find! (Figure 7-1 shows a typical cache.)
Getting Started Geocaching
Just about anyone can participate in geocaching; gender, age, and economic
status don’t much matter. The main requirements are a spirit of adventure, a
love of puzzles and mysteries, and a sense of fun. This section discusses what
you need to geocache, how to select caches to look for, and how to find them.
What you need to geocache
Geocaching sounds pretty intriguing, doesn’t it? But before you can try it out,
you need a few things. You probably already have many pieces of the required

Chapter 7: Geocaching

gear, and your biggest investment will be a GPS receiver if you don’t already
have one. (Read Chapter 5 for the lowdown on selecting a receiver.) With that
in mind, here’s a list of basic things you need.
I start off with the technology-related items:
 Cache location: Obviously, you need to know where to look for a cache:
a set of latitude and longitude or UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)
coordinates. You’ll find tens of thousands of caches freely listed on the
Internet. For information on locating a geocache, see the appropriately
named section, “Selecting a cache to look for,” later in this chapter.
 Geocaching alias: Most people who geocache use a registered handle
(alias) instead of their real name when they sign cache logs or make
Internet posts. The aliases are cool-sounding names like Navdog, Wiley
Cacher, or Moun10Bike. Be imaginative and come up with an alias that
fits your personality. The aliases are all unique: If you try to register an
alias on one of the popular geocaching Web sites and someone else
already has registered the alias, you need to select another name.
 GPS receiver: You can certainly find caches by using only a map and
compass (my adventure racing team does this to practice our navigation
skills), but it’s sure a lot easier when using a GPS receiver. You don’t need
an expensive GPS unit with lots of whistles and bells to geocache; a basic
model around or under $100 will work just fine; receivers that support
WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation Service, as described in Chapter 3) usu-
ally are more accurate than those that don’t.
Don’t forget to bring the GPS receiver user manual, especially if you just
purchased your receiver and are still trying to figure out how to use it.
A few other things can make your outing a little more enjoyable:
 Map and compass: A fair number of geocachers use only their GPS
receiver to get them to a cache, but a good local map of the area can 
be very helpful. Although a receiver can lead you directly in a straight
line to cache, it’s probably not going to tell you about the river, deep
canyon, or cliffs between you and the cache. Even GPS receivers that
display topographic maps often won’t show enough detail that can help
or hinder you on your way to a cache. Additionally, a map and compass
serve as a backup just in case something goes wrong with your GPS.
(Just make sure you know how to use them.)
 Pen or pencil and paper: Carry a small pad of paper and a pen or pencil
for taking notes about your route or things that you see on the way. Some
geocachers keep an ongoing journal of their adventures, and you never
know — you might turn into a geocaching Hemingway.
 Something to leave in the cache: When you locate a cache, you’ll find all
sorts of swags, which are treasures other people have left. Don’t expect
diamonds, gold bullion, or Super Bowl tickets, though. (You’re far more
likely to find baseball cards, costume jewelry, or corporate marketing
120
Part II: All About GPS 

giveaways.) Just remember that one man’s trash is another man’s trea-
sure. The best things to leave in a cache are unique, out-of-the-ordinary
items (such as foreign coins, fossils, exotic matchbooks, or anything that
has a high cool factor). And, please, avoid leaving McToys, geocaching
lingo for junk that you reasonably expect to find with fast-food kid’s meals.
For more of the lingo, check out the section, “GeoJargon: Speaking the
lingo,” later in this chapter.
 Appropriate clothes and footwear: There are no geocaching fashion
police, so wear clothes that are comfortable, weather appropriate, and
suitable for getting dirty. Even if it’s the middle of summer, it’s not a 
bad idea to bring along a jacket in case of an unexpected rain shower 
or drop in the temperature. Also, make sure you’re wearing sturdy and
comfortable footwear if the cache is outside an urban area. High heels
and wingtip loafers generally aren’t recommended.
 Food and water: Some caches take all day to find, so be prepared with
enough food and water to get you through your search; you can even
plan a picnic lunch or dinner around your outing.
 Walking stick/trekking poles: If the terrain is really rough, a good walk-
ing stick or set of trekking poles can make life much easier when going
downhill and negotiating uneven surfaces. A stick or a pole is also useful
for poking around in rock cracks looking for a cache, just in case there’s
a creepy-crawly inside.
 Digital camera: Although definitely not a required piece of geocaching
gear, a number of cachers tote along a digital camera to record their
adventures or to post pictures on the Web.
 Small pack: It’s much easier to put all your geocaching gear in a small
daypack rather than stuffing your pockets full of stuff.
Don’t forget a few safety-related items. As the Boy Scouts say, be prepared:
 Flashlight: This is a must-have for looking in cracks and crevices where
a cache might be hidden — and also in case you run out of daylight. If
you’re smart, your flashlight uses the same type of batteries as your GPS
receiver, giving you even more spare batteries.
 Cellphone: You probably have a cellphone, so bring it along (preferably
with the battery fully charged). Just a note of advice, from my search
and rescue experiences: I’ve found at times that people think of their
cellphones as an absolute insurance policy against trouble. They can
fail, cellphone batteries go dead, and you might have really bad cell 
coverage out in the middle of nowhere. So although a cellphone is great
to have along, be prepared to take care of yourself!
 Spare batteries: I always bring along spare batteries for anything that
uses them. (In this case, that means your GPS receiver and flashlight —
and if you’re really safety conscious, your cellphone, too.)

Chapter 7: Geocaching

That’s the basic gear you need for geocaching. The whole key with gear lists
is to find out what works best for you. You’ll probably end up carrying too
much stuff in your pack at first. After you’ve geocached for a while, check
your pack and see what you’re not using so you can lighten your load.
Most geocaches are located in pretty tame, civilized areas (usually 100 feet or
so off a main trail or road), but I advise letting someone know where you’re
going, when you’ll be back, and what to do if you’re late. Twisted ankles and
broken-down cars seem to happen a lot in areas without cellphone service. 
If you haven’t spent much time in the great outdoors, check out a list of The
Ten Essentials (which has been expanded to 14 over the years) at www.back
packing.net/ten-essl.html.
Selecting a cache to look for
After you get all your gear together, ready to venture out into the wilds, comes
this one small detail: How do you know where to look for a geocache?
Like most other modern-day searches for information, start with the Internet.
Many Web sites have listings of geocaching caches. I list some of the best
Internet resources in the upcoming section, “Internet Geocaching Resources.”
Geocaching.com (www.geocaching.com) is currently the most widely used
site and has the largest database of geocaches all over the world; most of the
information in this chapter is orientated toward that site. However, if you use
another geocaching Web site, you’ll find most of the same general techniques
described here for selecting a cache also apply to other sites.
You can set up a free user account on Geocaching.com to log caches that you
find, as well as to be informed of new caches that are placed in your area.
Anyone with Internet access can freely view the cache locations without an
account. Site owner Jeremy Irish also has Premium Member subscription
services ($30 per year) and sells products to help keep the site running.
To start, go to www.geocaching.com. Finding caches is as simple as entering
the ZIP code for where you’re interested in geocaching. You can also search
for caches by state, city, country, latitude, longitude, or by street address
(only in the United States). The basic search screen is shown in Figure 7-2.
After you enter where you’d like to search for caches, a list of geocaches in
that area is displayed (see Figure 7-3). The list is sorted by how far away the
cache is from the search criteria you entered; the closest geocaches are dis-
played first. The name and type of the cache is shown, when it was first placed,
when it was found last, and how difficult the cache is to get to and find. You
can scroll through the list of geocaches until you find one that looks interest-
ing. Cache names that are lined out are no longer active.

Chapter 7: Geocaching

Just click the name of a cache displayed in the list about which you want more
information to see a page with the following information. (Cache details dis-
played on the page are shown in the upcoming Figures 7-4 and 7-5.)
 Cache name: The name of the cache (usually the cache name has some-
thing to do with the area where it’s hidden, who hid it, or a play on
words). Bonus: If you hide a cache, you get to name it.
 Who placed the cache: This is usually a cacher’s alias.
 Cache type: Caches can be traditional (a single container), multicaches
(where clues in a single cache point to one or more other caches), or
virtual caches (a cool location that doesn’t have a container).
 Cache coordinates: These record where the cache is located in latitude
and longitude and UTM coordinates; these coordinates use the WGS 84
datum, so be sure your GPS receiver is set to this datum.
 When the cache was hidden: The date the cache was originally placed.
 Cache waypoint name: All caches in the Geocaching.com database have
a unique name: for example, GC followed by the numeric order the cache
was added to the database. You can use this to name a GPS waypoint for
the cache location.
 Difficulty: The difficulty rating is how hard the cache placer thinks the
cache will be to find; 1 is easiest, and 5 is the most difficult. Whoever
places the cache decides the difficulty level, based on some general 
criteria, such as how steep or rocky the terrain is or if you have to go
through very much underbrush to reach the cache.
 Terrain: The terrain rating is how difficult the terrain is. 1 is flat, easy,
and level; 5 could be very steep and rocky with lots of underbrush and
generally miserable travel conditions. Like with the difficulty rating, it’s
up to the cache placer to rate the terrain.
 General description of the cache: Cache descriptions range from a
couple of sentences to stories and history lessons about the location.
Clues often appear in the description, so check it closely.
 Map location of the cache: At the top of the page is a small state map
from which you can take a general idea of where the cache is. A larger
map with more detail appears at the bottom of the page. You can click
the larger map and go to the MapQuest Web site, where you can zoom in
on the cache site.
 Hints: The cache placer can optionally add hints to help a geocacher
narrow his search. The hints are in code; I discuss these in the following
“Finding the cache” section.
 Logged visits: This is a list of all the comments about the cache from
people who have visited it and then logged Web site comments.
124
Part II: All About GPS 

Some of these logged visit comments may contain spoilers, which are hints
that may make it easier to find the cache. Although most cachers try not to
spoil the fun for others, sometimes a clue accidentally appears.
Before heading out to search for a cache, check the last time someone found
it. Although Geocaching.com tries to keep track of inactive caches, sometimes
caches that have been stolen or kidnapped by space aliens slip through the
cracks. If you’re just getting started geocaching, go after caches that have
had some recent activity. This increases the odds that they’ll still be hiding
where they’re supposed to be when you go looking for them.
Finding the cache
After you select a cache you want to search for, the next step is finding it.
This might be a little bit more challenging than you think. Remember that
your GPS receiver will only get you within 10–30 feet of the cache location —
perhaps even farther away if you have poor satellite coverage or the cache
hider’s coordinates are a little off. After your GPS unit gets you to the general
vicinity of the cache, start using your eyes and your brain, which at times
might be more reliable than your GPS receiver.

Chapter 7: Geocaching

Sometimes a series of caches are located close together, usually separated by
at least a tenth of a mile. Because you’re already in the neighborhood, con-
sider trying to find several instead of going for just a single cache. Check out
the link on the cache description page that displays all the nearby caches
and how far away they are from each other.
Finding a cache boils down to following these general steps:
1. Enter the cache coordinates in your GPS receiver as a waypoint and
then add a name for the waypoint on your GPS receiver.
The methodology for entering waypoints differs from model to model.
Check your user manual for specific instructions about how to enter and
name a waypoint on your GPS model. Read more about this in Chapter 4.
You can use the six-character waypoint name on the cache description
Web page for the name of the waypoint. Double-check that you’ve entered
the correct coordinates. Many caches haven’t been found on the first try
because of an typo in the coordinates in a GPS unit.
If you have an account on Geocaching.com, you can download the cache
waypoint to your computer from a link on the cache description page
and then upload the waypoint directly to your GPS receiver. Doing so
helps to eliminate errors caused by typos in GPS coordinates.
2. Print a copy of the cache description Web page so you can bring all
the information you need to find the cache with you.
If your printer is out of ink or you’re being frugal, scribble down the
coordinates and any other information that you think might be useful 
in locating the cache.
3. Gather your equipment, including your GPS receiver, map, compass,
food, water, and other essential items mentioned in this chapter.
4. Head out to the cache’s starting point.
Drive or bike as close to the cache as you can get. Sometimes the cache
descriptions give you exact instructions, like at which parking lot or
trailhead to start from. The more challenging caches give you only the
coordinates, and it’s up to you to decide where you’ll start from and how
you’ll get there. One of the pleasures of geocaching is it’s usually not a
timed event (although a few timed competitions are starting to crop up),
and you can take as long as you want to reach the cache site, stopping
to smell the roses and enjoy interesting sights.
5. Turn on your GPS receiver and get a satellite lock.
Hopefully! If not, you brought that map and compass, right?
126
Part II: All About GPS 

6. Save a waypoint for your starting point.
Getting back to your car can sometimes be a challenge after finding a
cache, and saving a waypoint with your car’s location can make life
much easier (and get you home in time for dinner). Your GPS manual
contains details for setting a waypoint for your particular model.
7. Double-check to make sure that you have the coordinates, cache
description, hints, and the rest of your geocaching equipment in your
possession. (Keeping it all together in a backpack is convenient.)
From personal experience, I can tell you it’s never any fun arriving at the
cache and remembering that I left vital clues in the cache description
that’s now a couple of miles away in the car.
8. Activate the cache’s waypoint.
Activating a waypoint tells the receiver to calculate the distance and
direction from your current spot to the waypoint’s location. Your GPS
unit will let you know how far away the cache is and what direction you
need to head to get there. (This often is as simple as pressing a button
on the GPS receiver and selecting the waypoint you want to go to.)
9. Follow the direction arrow, road map display, or compass ring on
your GPS receiver toward the cache.
A local map can come in handy as you move toward the cache because
you can use it to figure out what the terrain is like and whether any
rivers, cliffs, or mountains lie between you and the cache. You can use
some of the online digital maps discussed in Chapter 19 for preplanning
or print them out to use in the field.
Don’t feel compelled to always head in the direction your GPS unit tells
you to go. It might make more sense to walk around a pile of rocks or
downed trees than to go over the top of them. After you get around an
obstacle, you can check your receiver again to get on the right course.
Watch your step! As you head toward the cache, don’t get so caught up
in staring at your GPS receiver that you fall off a cliff or trip over a tree
root. And watch the scenery, too. Sometimes the journey is the reward.
10. When your receiver says you’re within 30 feet or so of the cache,
move around and find the place that reports the closest distance to
the cache.
Begin your search at that spot. This is where the real fun starts. You now
shift from relying on technology to using your powers of observation
and common sense. A cache could be inside a cave, tucked in a tree
hollow, hiding behind a rock outcropping, or concealed under a pile of
brush. Some caches are easy to find, and others are devilishly difficult.
127
Chapter 7: Geocaching

As you start looking around, you can do a few things to help improve your
odds of finding the cache:
 Find out the maximum distance to the cache. Check the Estimated
Position Error (EPE) to see how accurate your GPS receiver currently is,
based on the satellite coverage. Remember: The bigger the number, the
less accuracy. This helps you roughly determine how large your search
area is. For example, if the EPE is 20 feet, your search area is a circle with
a 40-foot diameter, with the center at the closest location that you can
get to the cache waypoint.
 Follow a magnetic compass. When you’re within 30 feet of the waypoint
and your GPS receiver is showing a consistent bearing to the cache (tree
cover and poor satellite coverage can cause the distance and direction
numbers to jump around), use a magnetic compass to guide yourself to
the cache. As you slow down, unless your receiver has an electronic com-
pass, the direction that your receiver shows to the waypoint becomes
less precise, and you can easily veer off-course. Handheld magnetic com-
passes or electronic compasses built into the GPS unit don’t rely on
satellite signals, and won’t have this problem.
 Think about the container. Knowing what kind of container the cache is
stored in can be a big help in identifying and eliminating possible hiding
spots. Sometimes the cache description lists the container type (ammo
can, plastic ware, bucket, or whatever), which can narrow your search
based on the container size and shape. For example, you shouldn’t be
looking for an ammo can in a three-inch-wide crack in a rock.
 Think about the terrain. Look at the surrounding environment to get a
general idea of where a cache might be hidden. What natural (or man-
made) features make a good hiding place? Remember, unlike pirate booty
hiding, geocaching has a rule against burying cache containers, so you
shouldn’t be burrowing holes like a gopher.
128
Part II: All About GPS 
Geocaching stats
Just like any sport, geocaching has statistics
(stats). In this case, stats refer to the number 
of caches that you’ve found and hidden. When
you sign up for a free or premium account at
Geocaching.com, you can log the caches
you’ve found as well as add caches that you’ve
hidden to the site’s extensive database. The Web
site tracks the finds and hides for you and dis-
plays them on a user profile page. Other members
can check out your stats, and the number of
caches that you’ve found appears next to your
alias when you log your comments about a cache
you’ve visited. Some geocachers are competi-
tive and are in to racking up as many cache
finds as possible. Others are more blasé about
the whole numbers thing and could care less.
Like so many other aspects of geocaching, it’s
up to you how you want to play the game.

 Split up the work. If you’re geocaching with other folks, assign areas for
people to check. Although you don’t need to precisely measure and grid-
off squares, divvying up an area to search is faster and more efficient
than randomly wandering around.
 Think like a cache hider. If you were going to hide a cache, where would
you hide it? Sometimes trusting your intuition can be more effective than
trying to apply logic. After you check the ordinary places, start looking
in the unordinary spots.
There’s an old safety saying in wildland firefighting that goes, “Look up,
look down, look all around.” The same advice applies to geocaching,
which is an excellent way to improve your overall awareness and obser-
vation skills.
Going in circles
This will happen: You find the general cache location, but after a couple of
hours of wandering around in circles, you still can’t find the cache container.
You’ve double-checked the coordinates, the satellite coverage is good, and
you’re starting to get a bit frustrated. Take a deep breath. Here’s what to do.
You can always resort to using a hint. Most cache description pages have a
short hint, but you have to work for it because it’s encoded. The reason for the
spy stuff is so the hint doesn’t spoil the fun for another cacher who doesn’t
want to use the hint as part of his search. Fortunately, the hint is encoded
with a simple substitution code (for example, A = M, B = N, C = O, and so on),
so you don’t need to work for the NSA to be able to break it. The decoding
key is on the right side of the page, and it’s pretty easy to figure it out by
hand. See Figure 7-5 for what a coded hint and decoding key look like.
One of the more challenging types of caches to find is a microcache. Instead
of using large containers, smaller ones — like small pill bottles, 35mm film
canisters, or magnetic hide-a-keys — are used that only hold a piece of paper
that serves as the log. These caches are typically in urban areas and can be
cleverly hidden to avoid detection by nongeocachers passing by.
In addition to the hint, you can also look through the logged visit comments
that other people have posted who have already found the cache. Although
most geocachers try to avoid including spoilers (way-too-obvious hints or
commentary) into their comments, sometimes enough information leaks
through that can help you narrow your search.
How you go about finding the cache is up to you. Some purists will use only
the coordinates and basic description of the cache, never using the hints 
or the comments. Other cachers decrypt the hint and read all the comments
before they head out the door on a search. It’s up to you.
129
Chapter 7: Geocaching

There’s no shame in a DNF (Did Not Find); it happens to everyone. Go back 
to the cache location another day and try again. Geocaching is supposed to
be fun, so don’t take it too hard if you can’t locate a cache. Consider bringing
someone else with you next time: Two heads are better than one, and a differ-
ent set of eyes might find something you overlooked. Don’t be shy about 
logging a DNF for the cache at the Geocaching.com site. If a cache owner
hasn’t visited the site in a while, a number of logged DNFs could mean that
the cache has been moved or stolen by someone. Unfortunately, cache van-
dalism and thievery happen: For example, the cache you were looking for
might have been stolen, and the database hasn’t been updated yet.
Lost but now found
In more cases than not, after looking around for a while, behold! You find an
old, olive-drab ammo can tucked behind some rocks. Congratulations, you
found your first geocache! Now what?
 Savor the moment. There’s definitely a sense of accomplishment when
you find a cache and a little bit of childlike wonder as you open up the
container to see what types of treasures are inside.
 Sign the logbook. Write down the date, a few sentences about your
experiences finding the cache, what you took and/or added, and your
Figure 7-5:
If you’re
stumped
(ha!), go 
for a hint.
130
Part II: All About GPS 

geocaching alias. Some people who are really into geocaching have
custom business cards or stickers made up for placing in the cache log.
 Read the logbook. It’s fun to read about other cachers’ adventures and
when they discovered the cache.
 Exchange treasures. If you take something from the cache, leave some-
thing. If you forgot your goodies, just sign the logbook. Quite a few geo-
cachers are more into the hunt for the cache than for the loot inside.
Trading up means leaving something in the cache that’s better than what
you take. There’s always been a considerable amount of discussion in
the geocaching community about how caches start out with cool stuff
but soon end up filled with junk (broken toys, beat-up golf balls, cheap
party favors, and so on). Some geocachers even take it upon themselves
to remove anything from a cache that doesn’t meet their personal quality
bar. If you can, trade up to make the finds more interesting for everyone.
 Cover your tracks. Seal the cache container up and put it back where
you found it, making sure that it’s hidden just as well as it was before you
found it.
 Go home. Use the track-back feature of your GPS receiver to follow your
exact path back to your car. Better yet, activate the waypoint that you set
for your car (but see some different sights by taking a new route back to
where you started).
 Share your experiences. When you get back to your computer (if you’re
a member of Geocaching.com), log your find on the Web site so the whole
world knows you found the cache. Go to the cache description page and
click the Log Your Visit link at the top of the page. (This is completely
optional. Some geocachers prefer operating under a low profile, keeping
their discoveries and adventures to themselves.)
 Do it again (and again, and . . .). After you have your first cache find
under your belt, you’re ready to venture out into the brave new world of
geocaching and find even more caches. As your experience with a GPS
receiver grows and your skills in navigation and cache finding improve,
you’ll likely want to start challenging yourself more by going after caches
that are more difficult to find and reach.
131
Chapter 7: Geocaching
The force is strong with this one
A Star Wars Darth Vader action figure, Travel
Bug, started his travels in an Arkansas geocache
in February, 2002. By the time he was returned to
his owner nine months later, he had journeyed
17,534.64 miles, including tagging along on aerial
missions in Afghanistan, pub-hopping in England,
and working on his tan in Florida. At last report,
Darth was getting some R&R in Texas.

GeoJargon: Speaking the lingo
Like any sport or pastime, geocaching has its own language. Because the
sport is so new, the jargon is still evolving, but here are some terms to be
familiar with so when you talk to other people about geocaching, you sound
like a pro.
 Archived: Caches that no longer exist but still appear in a Web site data-
base for historical purposes. A cache can be archived because it has been
stolen, is no longer maintained, or does not abide by the guidelines for
where caches should be placed.
 Cache machine: A preplanned event in a local area, where geocachers
look for caches. The event can last hours or days. This is a marathon-
endurance session of geocaching, where you try to find as many caches
as you can in a set amount of time. The event is named after a dedicated
geocacher. BruceS, a true cache machine, found 28 caches in 24 hours,
totaling 86 finds in 5 days.
 DNF: Did Not Find (as in, did not find the cache). It happens to everyone.
If you didn’t find the cache, try again on another day.
 FTF: First To Find. This means bragging rights that you were the first
person to find a newly placed cache.
 GPSR/GPSr: GPS receiver. Many people drop the R and just call a GPS
receiver a GPS.
 Hitchhiker: An object that moves from cache to cache. A hitchhiker is
marked with some instructions, telling the finding geocacher to take it
and place it in another cache.
 McToys: Cheap trinkets left in a cache, like the toys that appear in fast-
food kids’ meals. There are better things to leave in caches.
 Muggles: People you encounter on the trail who aren’t geocachers; from
the Harry Potter stories.
 Neocacher: An inexperienced or newbie geocacher.
 Signature item: Something unique that a particular geocacher always
places in a cache that he or she finds.
 Spoiler: Information that might give away the location of a cache.
 Swag: Goodies that you find in a cache; from the marketing term swag (or
schwag) used to describe the promotional trash and trinkets (tchotchkes)
handed out at trade shows.
 TNLN: Took Nothing, Left Nothing. Just what it sounds like. Also,
TNLNSL, which means that the geocacher signed the cache log.
132
Part II: All About GPS 

 Travel Bug (TB): A type of hitchhiker that you mark with a special dog
tag purchased from Geocaching.com. When TBs are found, their journey
is tracked on the Geocaching.com Web site. Travel Bugs can have spe-
cific goals (as in, getting from Point A to Point B) or are just released
into the world to see how far they can travel.
Hiding a Cache
After a while, you might get the urge to set up a cache of your own. This sec-
tion discusses how to create and hide your own cache. It’s not that difficult,
and most cache hiders spend $10 or less to set up their cache, which is some
pretty cheap entertainment these days. It’s also a way to give something back
to the sport.
Don’t rush out and hide a cache before spending some time finding caches.
Searching for other caches will give you some good ideas and set expectations
for creating your own. Check out Geocaching.com for the FAQs there as well
as a complete set of guidelines for hiding and placing caches.
Selecting a container
First things first. You need something to house your cache in. The only real
requirement for the container is that it needs to be waterproof, although some-
times cachers use plastic bags inside a nonwaterproof container. The size of
the container determines where you’ll be able to hide the cache and how full
you’ll be able to fill it with trading trinkets. Any container that you can think
of has probably been used for geocaching, including plastic buckets with lids,
breath mint tins, margarine tubs, 35mm film canisters, pill bottles, plastic Army
decontamination kit boxes, and PVC piping. You’ve probably got a suitable
geocaching container lying around the house or garage. Just for the record,
the two most popular types of cache containers are
 Ammo cans: Made of military surplus steel, ammunition (ammo) cans
work great because they’re sturdy and waterproof. They typically come
in two sizes, based on the machine gun ammunition they once held:
• 50 caliber: 11 inches long, 5.5 inches wide, and 7–5 inches deep.
• 30 caliber: 10 inches long, 3.5 inches wide, and 6.75 inches deep.
(The narrow cans tend to fill up with trinkets quicker.)
Depending on the terrain and vegetation, the olive-drab color makes
ammo cans difficult to spot. You can typically get ammo cans for around
five dollars or less from local or online Army surplus stores.
133
Chapter 7: Geocaching

 Tupperware: Rectangular Tupperware or other plastic storage contain-
ers are also a popular choice but aren’t quite as rugged as an ammo can.
Sometimes a geocacher won’t reseal the lid very well. Plastic containers
are cheaper and more available than ammo cans, and you can easily
match a size to go with any cache. Some cache hiders spray paint the
containers to make them blend better with the surroundings.
Location is everything
Just like in real estate or retail sales, location is everything when it comes to
placing a cache. After you select a container, figure out where to put it. The
location of your cache usually defines its success and popularity.
I recommend doing some initial research to locate a general area to hide your
cache. For many geocachers, visiting a new place with some unique feature,
incredible scenery, or just gorgeous view is every bit as important as finding
a cache. Keep this in mind as you use maps, travel guides, or memories from
your own explorations to help you select a good cache location.
An important part of your homework is discovering where caches are and are
not permitted. The geocaching community tends to be very aware that the
continued growth and success of the sport depends on good relationships
with landowners.
If you want to place a cache on private property, always first ask the owner’s
permission. Because geocaching is so new, many people don’t know what it
is, so take the time to explain how the sport works.
Always check with a governmental agency before placing caches on its land.
You can contact the agency directly, try a Google search to see whether its
geocaching policies are published on the Web, or talk with other geocachers
in your area to get their experiences in dealing with different agencies. For
example, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management recognizes geocaching as a
recreational activity and tends to be friendly toward cache hiders who want
to locate a cache in places other than wilderness or wilderness study areas.
The U.S. National Park Service, on the other hand, prohibits placing geocaches
on the land that it manages; if you’re caught hiding a cache on such land, it’s
a federal offense. Yipes.
After you figure out the land ownership issues, the next step is to ensure that
your cache appears in the Geocaching.com database. The site has a series of
common-sense criteria that a cache must meet to be added to its database.
Generally a cache can’t be
134
Part II: All About GPS 

 Buried: Covering it with braches or leaves is okay, but no digging, please.
 Placed in environmentally sensitive areas: This includes archaeological
and historic sites.
 Placed in national parks or designated wilderness areas: This is a no-no.
Sorry; them’s the rules.
 Placed within 150 feet of railroad tracks: Umm, this is for safety reasons.
 Placed anywhere that might cause concerns about possible terrorist
activities: Use your post-9/11 brain. This includes areas near airports,
tunnels, military facilities, municipal water supplies, and government
buildings or bridges.
 Placed within one-tenth of a mile of another cache: This is a rule for
adding a cache to the Geocaching.com database as well as simple geo-
caching etiquette.
 Of a commercial, political, or religious nature: Keep it neutral; don’t
cache something promoting some business or cause.
The geocaching community polices itself fairly well. If you put a cache where
it shouldn’t be, a cacher will probably let the Geocaching.com administrators
know about it, and the cache will be removed from the database.
After you select a good general location to put the cache, visit the area to
figure out exactly where you’re going to hide the cache. Use your creativity to
find a challenging hiding place: in a tree hollow, underneath bushes, wedged
in rocks, and so on. The more experience you have finding caches, the more
ideas you’ll have for good hiding places.
After you find your secret hiding spot, you need to determine the cache’s
coordinates as precisely as possible. (Use the WGS 84 datum; see Chapter 4
for more on this.) This can be challenging because of less-than-perfect satel-
lite coverage. You might find the location’s coordinates changing on your GPS
receiver every few seconds. Many GPS units have an averaging feature that
compares coordinates at a single spot over a period of time and then averages
the result. If your receiver does do averaging, get it as close to the cache as
possible, let it sit for five or ten minutes, and then copy down the cache coor-
dinates and enter them as a waypoint.
A manual approach to averaging is to set a waypoint for the cache location,
walk away, and then come back and set another waypoint. Repeat this until
you have 6–12 dozen waypoints; then examine the list of waypoints, and 
pick the one that looks the most accurate (generally the value in the middle
of the list).

Chapter 7: Geocaching

Stocking the cache
Here are the basics of what to cache in your cache.
 Logbook and writing utensil
At the very minimum, your cache should contain a logbook and a pen or
pencil so other cachers can write about their discovery. (Pencils work
better in cold climates because the ink in most pens will freeze); mechan-
ical pencils are the best because they don’t need sharpening. The logbook
is usually a spiral notebook with the name of the cache written on the
cover. Some cache hiders paste their personal logo or some other graphic
to the notebook cover. As the cache founder, you should write some pro-
found thoughts about the cache on the first page.
 Identifying information
The cache should have some information that identifies it as a geocache,
describes what geocaching is, and provides instructions to the finder.
(Non-geocachers often stumble upon a cache.) The Geocaching.com site
has an information sheet in a number of different languages that you can
print out and place in your cache; laminating this sheet is a good idea.
Be sure to mention the cache’s name and its coordinates.
 Treasures
Add some treasures to your cache. These should be unique and interest-
ing items. Because geocaching is a family sport, initially put a mix of
things in it that appeal to both adults and children. You don’t need to fill
the container up like a stocking at Christmas. Many caches start out with
6–12 small items. If you want, you can add a hitchhiker or a Travel Bug.
(Read more about both of these critters in the earlier section, “GeoJargon:
Speaking the lingo.”)
Even though your storage container may be waterproof, always put your log-
book and cache goodies into resealable plastic storage bags. This prevents
your cache from turning into a soggy mush when someone inevitably forgets
to seal the container’s lid.

Part II: All About GPS 
Taking geocaching to the extreme
Although geocaching usually doesn’t require a
high degree of fitness or special skills, a few
caches out there might be labeled extreme geo-
caching. A cache might be perched midway
down a cliff face, requiring climbing equipment to
rappel down to reach it. And a handful of caches
are underwater and can only be reached by
scuba diving. (GPS doesn’t work underwater, so
this would be the spot for a boat to anchor.)
Obviously, these types of caches limit the number
of finders but can be quite unique if you’re into
challenging and technical outdoor sport.

Submitting the cache
Time for a little advertising. It doesn’t do much good if people don’t know
about your cache after you place it. The Geocaching.com Web site currently
has the largest database of caches and is where most people go to find infor-
mation about caches. You need to have a free or premium account at the site
to be able to post your cache, so if you don’t have an account yet, go to the
site and sign up. (I promise that it’s quick and painless.)
After you log on to the site, submitting a cache is just a matter of filling out an
online form about your new pride and joy. You enter things like the cache’s
name (think of something creative), its coordinates, the date it was placed,
and other information similar to what you find when you’re looking at a cache
description Web page.
If you’re having trouble trying to determine the terrain and difficulty ratings,
head over to geocacher ClayJar’s online terrain and difficulty calculator, at
www.clayjar.com/gcrs.
After you enter all the cache information, submit the form. Volunteers will
check things like whether all the information needed is present, the coordi-
nates are generally correct, and the cache meets the general submission 
guidelines. Keep in mind that volunteers don’t physically visit the cache
because that would require thousands of people all over the world with a 
considerable amount of free time on their hands. The approval process can
take up to a couple of days but is usually shorter. If you’re approved, your
cache is added to the database. If you’re not approved, you’ll be informed
why, and you can either address the problem and resubmit or discuss the
issue with the staff.
If you’re handy with HTML and your Internet provider supports Web hosting,
you can associate a Web site with your cache. The Web site might have digi-
tal photos, detailed maps, or anything else that supplements or complements
the standard information found in a cache database entry.

Part II: All About GPS 
The Oregon Hell Hole
It all started in June when Croaker posted a mes-
sage in a Geocaching.com Web forum, asking
about something called The Oregon Hell Hole.
He remembered seeing a public television show
about it several years back. The Hell Hole was
considered such a dangerous place that the
U.S. Forest Service didn’t want anyone to know
where it was located.
A geocacher named Moun10Bike mentioned that
he had an old newspaper article that described
a 200-foot-deep rift in the forest floor somewhere
in the Willamette National Forest, above the North
Fork of the Middle Fork of the Willamette River.
The location had been deliberately kept out of
tourist books and omitted from government maps
since the 1930s,and there were ominous quotes
from a Forest Service geologist about how easy
it would be for someone to get killed because of
the crumbling rock around the deep hole.
Geocachers are by nature very curious people,
and the thought of a spectacular geologic for-
mation that was being covered up by the gov-
ernment got the forum all riled up. Soon there
were posts from people examining aerial pho-
tographs (some conspiracy theorists offered
that likely even aerial photos had been doctored),
visiting university libraries in search of old maps,
asking relatives employed by the Forest Service
for information, and trying to find a copy of the TV
show to see whether it might offer any clues to
the location of the secretive Hell Hole. Thirteen
days after Croaker’s original post, Navdog solved
the mystery when he located a videotape of the
TV show at the library.
By pausing the video at a key point where a map
and aerial photograph were shown, like Sherlock
Holmes, Navdog put these and other clues
together and posted a series of maps where he
believed the Hell Hole was located. A few hours
later, Uplink confirmed Navdog’s hypothesis,
posting a scanned map from 1937 that had the
words Hell Hole printed exactly where Navdog
thought the rift was.
There was much discussionabout getting a group
of geocachers together to visit the place — not
to descend into the Hell Hole but just to see what
it was like. Almost everyone agreed that placing
a cache there wouldn’t be a good idea. (Most
geocachers are sensitive to their sport being
potentially overly regulated by federal land man-
agers, and if the Forest Service had been trying
to keep the Hell Hole secret for all these years,
it would be like thumbing your nose at them by
advertising a cache there.)
After several failed attempts by others, Grin’n’
Bearit and Lef-t made it to the Hell Hole on July
19. After about five hours of searching and bush-
whacking, the geocachers found the Hell Hole
and left a cache there.
The cache’s listing in the database generated a
storm of controversy in the forum, with fears
about safety and getting the Forest Service angry
about their once secret place now revealed to
the world. There was a heated debate, as each
side weighed in with their opinions.
In the end, Grin’n’Bearit returned to the Hell Hole.
Instead of the tangle of underbrush he initially
encountered, he found a new path from a differ-
ent road. It was a three-minute walk from where
he parked to the edge of the Hell Hole. He
reported well-used trails, all leading to the hole.
He moved the cache to a safer spot and changed
the description in the database.
The story of the Oregon Hell Hole is a testament
to the ingenuity, creativity, and community spirit
of geocachers as well as the struggles involved in
trying to do the right thing for their sport. Although
perhaps not as dramatic, lesser versions of this
story happen every day.

Maintaining the cache
After you hide your cache and it appears in the database, your work isn’t over
yet. You now have the responsibility of maintaining the cache. This means
visiting the cache every now and then to verify that it’s there and in a good
state of repair. You may even need to restock it with some trinkets if the supply
is running low. During your visits, check that the area around the cache isn’t
being extremely impacted by people searching for the cache. If the site is being
disturbed, consider either moving the cache to a new location or pulling the
cache entirely. (If you decide to temporarily or permanently remove a cache,
be sure to post a log entry to let other geocachers know when they look up
information about the cache. Also, let the Geocaching.com administrators
know so they can update their database.)
In addition to physically checking the cache, you should also check your
cache online and read the comments posted from people who have visited
the cache. These comments can alert you when it’s time to make a mainte-
nance call to the cache. Patience, Grasshopper! Sometimes it can take a 
while for someone to first find your cache and post about it.
Geocaching Etiquette
For the most part, there aren’t a whole lot of rules when it comes to geo-
caching. It mostly boils down to respecting other cachers and the land that
you play on. Consider these etiquette points when you’re out geocaching:
 Always respect private property. Need I say more?
 Don’t leave food in a cache. Food can attract animals as well as get
smelly and messy, and plastic cache containers have been chewed
through to get at a tasty snack.
 Never put anything illegal, dangerous, or possibly offensive in a
cache. Geocaching is a family sport, so be responsible.
 Always trade up or replace an item in the cache with something of
equal value. Don’t be a Scrooge; what’s the fun in that?
 Be environmentally conscious when searching for and hiding caches.
Tread lightly on the land. Check out the Leave No Trace site at
www.lnt.org for more information.
 Geocaching is a pretty dog-friendly sport. Keep it that way by having
Fido tethered in leash-only areas. And no matter how good your dog is,
have a leash ready in case other people or animals are around.
139
Chapter 7: Geocaching

 Cache In, Trash Out (CITO). If you see any litter on your way to or from
a cache, get some additional exercise with a deep-knee bend, pick it up,
and pack it out.
 Say thank you. After you visit a cache, send a quick e-mail, thank-you
message to the geocacher that placed the cache or acknowledge him or
her in your cache comments.
Internet Geocaching Resources
Because geocaching is very much a sport of the Internet community, the
Internet contains some terrific sites about the sport. Here’s a sample:
 Geocaching.com (www.geocaching.com): This is the primary geocaching
site on the ’Net. In addition to an extensive database of caches and FAQs
about the sport, the site also has a large number of forums dedicated to
different geocaching topics.
 Navicache.com (www.navicache.com): This is the second-largest Web
site dedicated to geocaching, but it’s still currently quite a bit smaller
than Geocaching.com in terms of caches listed. The site has many of the
same features as Geocaching.com and is often viewed as an alternative
to the more mainstream, larger site. There’s not much duplication in the
cache listings between the two big sites, so be sure to check both their
listings when searching for caches.
 Buxley’s Geocaching Waypoint (http://brillig.com/geocaching):
This site has a comprehensive set of maps that provides a bird’s-eye view
of caches in your area. Just click a dot on the map for cache information.
If you want to socialize with other geocachers in your area, local and regional
clubs and Web sites have sprung up. Many of these sites have their own lists
of caches and practical information for the novice or experienced cacher. Do
a Google search for geocaching and your city or state to search for Web sites
with more information. You can also find out more about geocaching in your
area by checking out the regional discussion forums at Geocaching.com.
The geocaching community is not immune to politics. Skirmishes and large-
scale battles can break out between individuals and rival Web sites. It’s best
to duck your head, check your GPS receiver, and head to the cache waypoint.

Chapter 7: Geocaching
Other caching pursuits
In addition to geocaching, a number of other
GPS-related activities have sprung up on the
Internet. A few that you might be interested in
include
 Geodashing: This is a contest in which
random points are selected and players need
to get within 100 meters of the location.
There are no caches, hints, or terrain diffi-
culty ratings, and the points can be any-
where on Earth. In fact, some locations can
be impossible to reach. A new contest takes
place roughly every month. The goal of the
game is for teams to collect all the points
first or to get as many as they can before
the contest ends. For more details, check out
www.geodashing.org.
 The Degree Confluence Project: This is an
interesting project in which people use their
GPS receivers to visit places where latitude
and longitude lines converge. They take a
digital picture, which is then published on a
Web site. The goal is to map all the major
latitude/longitude intersections for the entire
Earth. For more information, go to www.
confluence.org.
 Benchmark hunting: Benchmarks are per-
manent markers installed by the government
for survey purposes. Over one-half million
benchmarks have been installed in the
United States. The most familiar type is a
small, brass disk embedded into rock or con-
crete. The National Geodetic Survey (www.
ngs.noaa.gov) maintains a list of the
benchmarks and their locations. The Geo-
caching.com site also provides benchmark
locations and lets you log a benchmark when
you find one.
 GPS Drawing: This is an interesting form of
art based on using your GPS receiver to
record where you’ve been. For some amaz-
ing examples, check out the gallery at www.
gpsdrawing.com.

Digital Mapping
on Your Computer

In this part . . .
You get practical. This part is all about digital maps on
your PC — desktop mapping so to speak. You’ll find
out about hardware (both basic requirements for desktop
mapping and connecting a GPS receiver to a PC) and
review a number of different software packages you can
use to access aerial photos and topographic and street
maps.

Chapter 8
Digital Mapping Hardware
Considerations
In This Chapter
 Determining hardware requirements for different mapping activities
 Weighing hardware and peripheral digital mapping considerations
I
f you’re planning on using digital mapping software on your PC, you might
wonder about computer hardware and peripheral requirements (like a
printer). What kinds of computer and add-ons work best for creating and
using digital maps?
Your answer depends on what type of mapping you’ll be doing and what kind
of software you plan to use to access and create maps. In this chapter, I lead
you through your choices to give you a pretty good idea whether your cur-
rent computer can meet your mapping needs or whether you need to think
about investing in a new machine. I also cover how much storage you might
need as well as what makes a good printer for mapmaking.
An Internet connection is a must for anyone interested in digital mapping.
Digital Mapping Software Choices
Understandably, your hardware needs are driven by your software needs.
Here are the three main types of mapping programs you’re most likely to use:
 Commercial mapping programs: Commercial mapping programs come
bundled with maps and offer a number of powerful features but are rela-
tively easy to use. Most commercial map programs don’t have extensive
hardware requirements. In fact, many of the programs on the market work

fine with older computers. (I discuss GPS receiver manufacturer software
in Chapter 10 and street and topographic map software in Chapters 12
and 13.)
 Web-hosted map services: Web-hosted map services are accessed with
your Web browser. These map Web sites are easy to use but don’t offer as
many features as commercial or standalone mapping programs. Viewing
Web site maps isn’t a very resource-intensive activity. The speed of your
Internet connection is a bigger issue than the speed of your computer’s
processor. (For more on using Web-hosted map services of various types,
see Chapters 17, 18, and 19.)
 Standalone mapping programs: Standalone map programs are similar
to commercial map software but don’t come bundled with maps; you
need to provide the map data yourself. If you’re using a standalone pro-
gram to make maps from data that you download from the Internet —
especially if you’ll be creating 3-D images — you want as much processor
speed, memory, and storage as your budget allows. It also doesn’t hurt
to have a high-speed Internet connection to speed up downloads. (I talk
about some standalone map programs in Chapters 15 and 16.)
Additionally, you need to factor in your processing power as well as what
types of storage devices, display devices, printers, and communications
equipment you’ll need and use.
In most cases, if you’ve purchased a computer in the past couple of years
that runs Windows, it’s probably going to be more than adequate for com-
puter mapping. (Always check a mapping software vendor’s Web site first,
though, to ensure that your computer is compatible with the program you
plan to use.)
Processing Power
When it comes to software, whether it’s an operating system or program, the
processor and amount of memory your PC has can make a difference in per-
formance. Some people think that just like money, you can never have enough
processor speed or memory; when it comes to mapping software, though,
that’s not entirely true.
You don’t absolutely need to have the latest cutting edge and fastest technol-
ogy for computer mapping. You can easily get by using older computers and
peripherals. I have an old 500 MHz Pentium with 256K of RAM running
Windows 2000 that works fine for mapping. Granted, it’s a bit slower perform-
ing some tasks than faster, newer computers, but it still gets the job done.
With this in mind, take a look at practical processing and memory require-
ments for mapping software.
146
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Processors
Most commercial mapping programs have pretty humble processor require-
ments. To use these programs, your computer should have a modern
Pentium or similar chip with a minimum speed of 300 MHz. That’s a pretty
meager amount of computing power considering that current computers
offer at least six times greater processor speed, if not more. If you’re using
commercial mapping software, just about any contemporary computer is
going to fit the bill when it comes to processor requirements.
You’ll want a faster processor and more computing horsepower if you’re doing
a lot of 3-D mapping or processing large amounts of map data — particularly
creating maps from data that you download from the Internet. This can be a
processor-intensive task: The faster the chip, the quicker the map or terrain
image will be rendered and displayed. (Any Pentium III or above PC with a
processor speed of over 1.2 GHz should suffice for the average map user.)
Memory
If you look at the system requirements of commercial mapping software,
you’ll see some ridiculously low memory requirements considering what’s
standard in today’s computers. (When was the last time you saw a computer
advertised with 16, 32, or 64K of RAM? That’s actually some of the stated min-
imum memory requirements for a number of popular mapping programs.)
Every contemporary computer should have enough memory to work with
most mapping programs.
However, memory is one of those things that you can’t have enough of.
Although a computer with 128K of RAM is probably going to meet most of
your mapping needs, more memory will improve performance. If you’re run-
ning Microsoft Windows XP, you should consider running at least 256K of RAM.
Don’t fret over the different types of memory. Double Data Rate (DDR)
memory chips are indeed faster than conventional, synchronous dynamic
RAM (SDRAM) memory. But if you’re the average computer user doing typical
mapping projects, you’re probably not going to notice the difference.
Storage Capacity
Another important hardware consideration is storage capacity. Map data files
don’t tend to be small like word processing or spreadsheet documents, so
you need to plan accordingly. This section gives you some advice on ensuring
that your storage space is adequate for your maps.
147
Chapter 8: Digital Mapping Hardware Considerations

Hard drives
In these days of cheap, large hard drives, it’s easy to get a little blasé about
storage space. Digital mapping can take up quite a lot of hard drive space,
though, and you should be aware how much space your map software and its
data can consume.
Software storage needs
A mapping program can easily install between 300–500MB on your hard drive,
and that doesn’t count all the map data that’s contained on a CD. Depending
on program options and the types of maps to be used, you can easily have up
to 1GB of space taken up by a single mapping program. Always check the
software hardware requirements to ensure you’ll have enough storage space
to install the program.
If you’re running low on hard drive space, some mapping programs have a
minimal install option that leaves some program data on the CD instead of
writing it to the hard drive by default.
Data storage needs
Most commercial mapping programs come with map data on CDs, so you
shouldn’t need to worry about storage space unless you plan on copying the
map data on the CDs to your hard drive.
However, if you’re downloading lots of raw data from the Internet to create
your own maps, you definitely need to think about your storage space needs.
Map data is not small. For example, a single map data file can easily take up
5–10MB of space.
148
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 
Sweet emulation
Some mapping programs allow you to copy map
data from a CD to your hard drive. This is useful
because then you don’t need to find misplaced
data CDs or swap between CDs to view differ-
ent maps. Unfortunately, many commercial
mapping programs don’t give you this option.
Skirt this problem with a special type of soft-
ware: a CD emulator. This program allows you
to copy the contents of a CD onto your hard
drive to create a virtual CD. This tricks a map-
ping (or other) program into thinking that you
inserted its CD when the data actually already
resides on your hard drive. Sweet. Do a Google
search for CD emulator to find information about
various products. They tend to be reasonably
priced — under $40.

If you plan to collect lots of map data, you’ll definitely need a high-capacity
hard drive for storage. At 10MB per data file, 100 files quickly can consume a
gigabyte of disk space. Although you can get by using smaller hard drives, I’d
opt for at least an 80GB drive.
If you decide to get serious about computer mapping, I recommend that you
purchase a second internal or external hard drive to exclusively store your
data. A second drive provides more performance and is easier to maintain
and manage files. And because a second drive currently can be had for a little
more than a dollar per GB, the bigger the better.
CD and DVD drives
Just about every commercial software manufacturer uses CDs to distribute
their products. Digital map manufacturers are no different; they extensively
use CDs for map data. For example, the National Geographic Back Roads
Explorer (a whopping 16-CD set) provides topographic maps for the entire
United States. You can run these CDs on any CD drive; the higher the read
speed, the faster the map data will load and display.
Having a CD drive that can write (burn) CD-ROMs is way useful if you plan to
download large amounts of map data from the Internet. Because data files
can be very large, archive the data on CDs instead of cluttering your hard
drive with infrequently used files. If you’re not going to be archiving map
data, consider using CD-RWs (rewriteables) because you can delete files from
them, using them again and again.
Computers are now commonly equipped with a DVD drive, which can read
both CDs and DVDs. DVDs rock because they can store a whole lot more data
than a CD; compare 4.7GB on a DVD versus a relatively paltry 700MB on a CD.
As DVD drives become more commonplace on computers, expect map soft-
ware companies to start offering their products on DVD media. This will make
life easier for vendors who currently distribute map data on multiple CDs.
149
Chapter 8: Digital Mapping Hardware Considerations
DVD soup
As this book goes to press, DVD standards
have yet to be agreed on (by the manufactur-
ers as well as the ever-important consumers).
Check out this alphabet soup: There are DVD-
ROM, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, and
DVD-RAM formats. Some manufacturers are
hedging their bets on the standards race by
offering multiformat DVD drives. If you’re in the
market for a DVD drive, I’d certainly look for a
multiformat drive until a single DVD standard
emerges.

Display Equipment
Obviously you’re going to want to see your maps, so you’ll need a few pieces
of display equipment, such as a graphics card and monitor. Again, these don’t
have to be anything fancy. (Are you noticing a theme here when it comes to
mapping software hardware requirements?) Here are a few considerations for
display hardware.
Graphics cards
Unlike computer video games, graphics card requirements for mapping 
programs are pretty minimal. All you need is a Super Video Graphics Array
(SVGA) card, which has come standard on computers for years. If your map-
ping software supports 3-D terrain display, a card that has a graphics accelera-
tor will draw map images faster. An accelerator isn’t an absolute requirement
because most commercial programs that support 3-D rendering take advan-
tage of a graphics accelerator only if it is present. Check the specs of your cur-
rent PC (or one you’re considering purchasing) to see whether an accelerator
is present.
Monitors
Just like the broad, general hardware requirements theme for mapping,
bigger (that is, a bigger monitor) is better. Although most programs work fine
on a 15-inch monitor, the larger the monitor, the more map area can appear
onscreen. 17-inch monitors, which come standard with most computers
these days, are more than adequate for digital mapping. However, if you’re
spending a lot of time using maps in front of a computer screen, consider a
larger (19-inch or 21-inch) monitor, which is both easier on the eyes and can
display much more data.
In Windows, change the display size of a monitor via the Display Properties
dialog box. To access this, right-click the desktop and select Properties from
the contextual menu that appears. On the Settings tab, you can change the
display area to different sizes such as 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, or 1280 x 1024
pixels. Try some of these different settings to see which works best for your
mapping program as well as your eyes.
Printers
At some point, you’re probably going to want to print a digital map. (See
Chapter 22 for some great tips on printing maps.) Expensive plotters and
150
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

large format printers are important for a professional mapmaker, but any
printer that can output the map in a readable fashion is fine for the average
computer user. However, some printers are more suited for digital mapping
than others.
 Color printers: Black-and-white printers are perfectly suitable for print-
ing maps, but color output is usually easier to read and understand,
especially when using topographic maps. A colored map produced on a
cheap inkjet printer might be more useful than a crisp black-and-white
map that came from an expensive laser printer. When cartographers
make maps, they design them to be either black and white or color.
Important information can be lost when a map program translates a
color map into the inherent shades of gray in black and white.
 Resolution: The higher the print resolution in dots per inch (dpi), the
better the map will appear; especially for maps that show a lot of detail.
Printers designed for printing digital photos work quite well in repre-
senting topographic and other detailed maps.
 Print speed: Some printers are faster than others, and a faster printer
means you get to see and use your printed map quicker. Printers are
rated in pages per minute (ppm), which is the number of pages that can
be printed in a minute. When you’re comparing page per minute ratings,
be sure you look at the numbers for printing graphics instead of at text.
 Cost per page: If you’re frequently printing maps, it makes good eco-
nomic sense to use a printer with a reasonable cost-per-page rating (the
estimated cost to print a single page, considering paper and ink). Cost-
per-page rates vary considerably between printers and are usually men-
tioned in magazine and online reviews.
Communication Capabilities
If you want your GPS receiver to be able to talk to your map software or if
you plan on accessing the Internet to use Web map sites or to download map
data, your PC needs to have some basic communication capabilities. Take a
quick look here at communications ports and Internet connectivity.
Communication ports
You can connect most GPS receivers to your computer through the computer’s
serial port. (I discuss ports and connectivity thoroughly in Chapter 9.) If you
want to download data from a GPS receiver to use with a digital map or upload
maps and data to a GPS receiver, your computer needs a serial port and a
special cable to connect the two devices. (Note: Some GPS receivers use a
faster USB connector to interface with a computer.)
151
Chapter 8: Digital Mapping Hardware Considerations

If your computer doesn’t have a serial port, as is the case with a number of
laptop computers, you need a USB adapter and serial cable to connect your
GPS receiver to a computer. Read more about this in Chapter 9, also.
If your GPS receiver supports both a serial connection and a Secure Digital
(SD) or MultiMediaCard (MMC) memory card for storing data, use the
memory card when you’re exchanging data. It’s both faster and easier to use
than a serial cable when interfacing the GPS receiver to your computer. You
will need a card reader connected to your computer to transfer data to and
from the memory card. See Chapter 9 for more on these memory cards
and readers.
Internet connection
You need a modem and an Internet account if you want to
 Download mapping software updates
 Use Web-hosted mapping services
 Download data for creating maps
An Internet connection is a must for anyone interested in digital mapping.
If you plan to download digital maps and aerial photographs, you really
should have a broadband Internet account (DSL or cable modem). Even when
compressed, these files can be very large, and it can be painfully slow waiting
for the data to arrive on a slower, dialup connection.

dmittedly, your GPS receiver is pretty darned useful even if you can’t 
connect it to your computer. With your receiver, you can find your way
around as well as your way back, even if you don’t know what a computer is.
The ability to connect your GPS receiver to your computer, however, can make
your GPS receiver even more useful . . . heck, a lot more useful. Essentially, a
connection between your GPS receiver and your computer allows them to talk
and share information, such as uploaded maps and waypoints to your receiver
as well as downloaded receiver information that you store while on your
adventures.
In this chapter, I show you why this interconnectivity is a fantastic addition to
your receiver. You’ll discover the ins and outs of the physical connections, how
to get your computer and receiver to speak the same language, the lowdown
on great receiver utility programs, and how to upgrade your receiver firmware.
About (Inter)Face: Connectivity Rules
If you choose to use a mapping GPS receiver (one that you can upload maps
to from a PC), you’re in the right chapter. And kudos to you to getting a
model that really lets you maximize using your GPS receiver. You’ll be out-
door navigating and geocaching (check out Chapter 7) in no time. Here are
the very cool things you can do with a PC-compatible receiver:

 Back up and store GPS receiver waypoints, routes, and tracks on your
computer. (Get the skinny on all these important critters in Chapter 4.)
 Download waypoints, routes, and tracks from your GPS receiver to your
computer to use with computer mapping programs.
 Upload waypoints, routes, and tracks to your GPS receiver from other
sources such as Internet sites, other GPS users, or mapping programs.
 Upload maps from your computer to your GPS receiver (if your receiver
supports mapping). For more on selecting a GPS with mapping capabili-
ties, see Chapter 5.
 Provide GPS data to a moving map program on a laptop for real-time
travel tracking such as the ones that I describe in Chapters 12 and 13.
 Update your GPS receiver’s firmware.
Anatomy of a Link: Understanding 
the Interface Process
Before I talk about how to interface a GPS receiver to a PC, you need to
understand the types of data that can be passed between the two devices:
 GPS receiver to PC: Saved waypoints, routes, tracks, and current loca-
tion coordinates
 PC to GPS receiver: Maps (if the GPS receiver supports them), way-
points, routes, and tracks
You can interface a GPS receiver to a computer and transfer data in two ways:
 Cable: Most GPS receivers use a special cable, with one end that plugs
into the receiver and the other that plugs into the serial or Universal
Serial Bus (USB) port of your computer. (See the upcoming section,
“Untangling Cables.”)
 Memory card: Some GPS receiver models use Secure Digital (SD) or
MultiMediaCard (MMC) memory cards to store data. You transfer data
between the GPS receiver and your computer with a card reader con-
nected to the computer. (See the later section, “Managing Memory.”)
If you use a Bluetooth wireless GPS receiver, you don’t need a cable or
memory card reader to transfer data. These are designed to be used exclu-
sively with laptops and PDAs; I discuss these in Chapter 6.
154
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Avoid GPS receivers that can’t interface with a personal computer. The bene-
fits of connecting to a computer far exceed the few dollars you’ll save.
Untangling Cables
If your GPS receiver uses a cable to connect to a computer and you want to
interface the two, you need the right type of cable. Some GPS receivers come
bundled with this cable; others don’t.
If you don’t have a cable for your GPS receiver, get one. Cables tend to vary in
design between manufacturers and models, so be sure to get the right one for
your GPS receiver. (See Figure 9-1 for examples of different types of cables.)
You can purchase a cable directly from the manufacturer at its Web site or
through a retailer. Expect cable prices to range from $20–$45.

Chapter 9: Interfacing a GPS Receiver to a Computer

For this connectivity, you need a PC interface cable. It has a connector that
attaches to the GPS receiver on one end and an RS-232, 9-pin serial connector
on the other end to connect to your computer.
Newer GPS receiver models support USB. If your GPS receiver supports both
serial and USB interfaces, use a USB cable for much faster communications.
If you bought a GPS receiver that didn’t come with a cable and you can’t find a
cable to buy, you’re not necessarily completely out of luck. If you’re handy with
a soldering iron, most GPS receiver manufacturer Web sites describe the pin-
out configurations of their cables so you can make your own. The tricky part
can sometimes be finding the right connector for the GPS receiver because
most connectors vary between manufacturers and models. A number of how-to
sites on the Internet show you how to build your own cables and where to get
the connectors. Do a Web search for gps cable connector and the brand of your
GPS receiver to find different options.
Some cables are designed to both power a GPS receiver from a cigarette
lighter and to connect to a computer to send and receive data. These cables
are especially useful if you’re using your GPS receiver with a moving map pro-
gram and a laptop. Just remember that you’ll also need to buy a dual, car cig-
arette-lighter adapter so you can plug in both your GPS receiver and laptop
into a single cigarette lighter.
If you have a Garmin receiver, check out the Pfranc company for its quality
Garmin-compatible cables. Larry Berg started out making shareware Garmin
cable plugs, and his business grew. He now stocks a line of reasonably priced
cables for all Garmin models. Check out his Web site at www.pfranc.com.
Understanding Ports and Protocols
Argg. You track down the right cable you need. You plug one end into your
GPS receiver and the other into your computer. And nothing happens. Exactly.
Nothing should happen because you need to be running some type of soft-
ware on your computer that enables the two devices to talk to each other.
Before I discuss interface software, however, I have to lay some groundwork.
The programs designed to communicate with GPS receivers have one thing in
common: You need to specify certain communication parameters in both the
program and the GPS receiver for the devices to successfully exchange data.
If the settings aren’t correct, you may as well try to communicate with some-
one a thousand miles away by sending smoke signals through a telephone
line. Although setting the right communications parameters isn’t that diffi-
cult, it can be a bit confusing. This section guides you through the process
and also gives you some tips on smoothing out some common problems that
you may encounter, beginning with ports and their settings.
156
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Setting up communications between a GPS receiver and a PC is a one-time
process. After you get everything working, no worries about the next time.
COM ports
A COM port is a computer serial port that’s used to connect a mouse, modem,
or other device, like a GPS receiver. (COM stands for communication, and the
ports are called serial ports because they receive data serially, one character at
a time.) COM ports typically have a small oval, D-shaped connector (with nine
pins) and are located on the back of your computer. (If you have other devices
plugged into your serial ports, you’ll need to unplug them so your GPS receiver
cable has a port to plug in to. You can plug the other devices back in when
you’re through transferring data with your GPS receiver.)
Your PC might have one or two physical serial ports that you can plug devices
into, but Windows allows you to assign a COM port number to each device.
These numbers usually range from 1 to 4 but might go as high as 256 if a USB
adapter is used, (which I talk about in the upcoming section, “USB ports”). In
most cases, you won’t need to use Windows to reassign any of the port num-
bers. Just know that you have numbered COM ports and that you need to
assign one to your GPS receiver, which I talk about next.
To get more detailed information about COM ports and Windows, including
how to change settings with Windows Device Manager, head to the Microsoft
support Web site at http://support.microsoft.com and search the
Knowledge Base for com port. Or pick up a copy of PCs For Dummies, 9th
Edition (Wiley) by Dan Gookin, which has an excellent chapter that clearly
explains everything you need to know about the subject.
The program you’re using to interface with the GPS receiver is where you need
to specify which COM port number the receiver is connected to. Programs typ-
ically use a drop-down list box that shows all the COM ports; just select one
from there. (Some programs have an autoselect feature that tries to establish
communications on all available COM ports until the port with the GPS
receiver is found.)
COM ports have properties that establish how the communication between
the two devices will occur. Generally, both of the devices need to have the
same settings. The COM port properties include
 Baud rate: Baud is the speed at which the port communicates with
other devices. This number is in bits per second (bps): the bigger the
number, the faster the speed.
 Data bits: This is the number of data bits that are transferred for each
character, typically 7 or 8.
157
Chapter 9: Interfacing a GPS Receiver to a Computer

 Parity: This is a form of error checking that ensures the integrity of
transferred data.
 Stop bits: This is how many bits follow a character and mark the end of
a data transmission.
 Flow control: Sometimes called handshaking, this is a way for one
device to stop another device from sending data until it’s ready to
receive the data.
Although you can set COM properties in Device Manager, I recommend
making changes in the program that you’re using to interface with the GPS
receiver. You’ll usually see an Options or Configuration menu in the program
that displays a dialog box where you can set these values. (See Figure 9-2 for
an example of a communications setting dialog box in a mapping program.)
Unless the program specifies otherwise, here are the typical COM port set-
tings to use when interfacing with a GPS receiver:
 Baud rate: 4,800 and 9,600 baud are almost certainly guaranteed to work
with all GPS receivers. You can increase the speed to a higher rate on
some types of GPS receivers. The higher the speed, the faster the data
transfer. I recommend experimenting until you find the fastest, most-
reliable baud rate, and then using that setting.
 Data bits: 8.
 Parity: None.
 Stop bits: 1.
 Flow control: None.
Figure 9-2:

program.
158
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Some GPS receivers allow you to set the baud rate in the system setup page
of the receiver, but other models don’t give you any control of the speed.
Check your GPS receiver user guide for more information about your model.
USB ports
Consumer GPS receivers first started appearing in the mid-1990s. At that
time, personal computers exclusively used serial ports to interface with
other devices, making it easy for hardware manufacturers to design their
products to communicate through a serial port. GPS was initially popular
with sailors because they could connect a GPS receiver to an autopilot or
chart plotter and navigate a vessel based on GPS data. With the right cable,
you can also connect your GPS receiver to a computer and download and
upload data.
Serial ports are now going the way of the dinosaur, replaced by easier-to-
use and faster USB ports. In fact, some laptops no longer have serial ports.
However, GPS manufacturers have been slow to jump on the USB bandwagon
and until recently have relied on serial port connections for getting GPS
receivers and computers to talk to each other.
At some point, GPS receivers with USB connectivity will eventually become
widely available in the marketplace. But until that time comes (and consider-
ing the millions of GPS receivers already manufactured that can connect only
through a serial port), what do you do if your computer doesn’t have a serial
port?
The solution is to use a USB serial port adapter. The adapter plugs into your
computer’s USB port and has a standard 9-pin connector that you can connect
your serial port devices to. After you install a driver for the adapter (which
comes with the product on a disk or CD), Windows recognizes the adapter as
a serial port. Just connect a PC interface cable to your GPS receiver and the
adapter, and you’re all set to send and receive data between the two devices.
(See a USB adapter in Figure 9-1.)
Note this one little “gotcha” to mention regarding USB adapters: Windows
might squawk that you need a driver when you plug in the adaptor, but you
know you’ve already installed one. The fix: In the dialog box that’s prompting
you for the driver location, tell Windows to look in the C:\Windows\Drivers
directory. (This path is for Windows XP; the location varies in older versions
of Windows: for example, C:\WINNT\system32\drivers in Windows 2000.)
Depending on what USB devices are running at the time, Windows XP might
assign the adapter to a different COM port from the last time it was used
and incorrectly assume it’s a new device that needs a new driver. This above-
mentioned directory is where previously installed drivers are stored, saving
you from having to find the original driver distribution disk.
159
Chapter 9: Interfacing a GPS Receiver to a Computer

All GPS receiver manufacturers sell their own branded serial-to-USB adapters,
albeit at a premium price. If you’re on a tight budget, most any third-party
adapter that you buy from a computer retailer will work. These adapters tend
to be cheaper than the GPS manufacturer brand-name models.
Protocols
A protocol is a way for two devices to successfully talk with each other. Think
of a protocol as a language with a strict set of rules. When one device sends a
message to another device, it expects a certain type of response back. This
structured, back-and-forth conversation takes place until one device sends a
message that says the conversation is over.
Likewise, when you connect a GPS receiver to a computer, a certain protocol
is used to transfer data back and forth between the two devices. You need to
ensure that the same protocol has been selected for both devices. If two dif-
ferent protocols are used, it’s like the GPS receiver speaking Russian to a
computer that understands only Chinese.
The protocols typically used with GPS receivers are
 NMEA: The National Marine Electronics Association came up with the
NMEA 0183 standard, which is a protocol for transferring data between
marine-related electronics such as GPS receivers, autopilots, and chart
plotters. Virtually all GPS receivers support the NMEA 0183 standard,
which uses widely documented text messages. Typical NMEA data
includes latitude, longitude, time, and satellite status.
NMEA comes in several different versions, including 1.5, 2.1, and 2.3.
Make sure that this version number matches both the GPS receiver and
the computer program that you’re using.
 Proprietary: Some GPS manufacturers have their own proprietary proto-
cols for communicating with a GPS receiver. These protocols send addi-
tional data that isn’t included in the NMEA standard: for example,
altitude, speed, and position error.
NMEA is the de facto standard for getting a GPS receiver to talk to a com-
puter. However, some programs support GPS manufacturer proprietary proto-
cols. If you have a choice between NMEA and a proprietary protocol (for
example, the Garmin protocol used with Garmin GPS receivers), select the
proprietary protocol because it can supply richer data to a program.
Managing Memory
If you own a GPS receiver that uses a memory card, congratulations! I person-
ally like the versatility these receivers offer (such as stuffing a bunch of maps
160
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

onto a single, large-capacity memory card). This section talks about how to
get the most out of your memory card GPS receiver. If your GPS receiver uses
only a cable to connect to a computer, you can skip this section. Better yet,
read along to see how memory cards work for transferring data. (Figure 9-3
shows a GPS receiver with a memory card.)
If your GPS receiver supports using a memory card, you have some signifi-
cant advantages when exchanging data with a computer, including
 Upload speed: Uploading maps from your computer to a GPS receiver is
considerably faster with a memory card than via a serial port cable.
Because GPS receivers communicate at a fairly low baud rate, transfer-
ring 10–20MB of map data can take a long time (up to hours depending
on how the serial port is configured).
 Affordable and practical: Memory cards have gotten inexpensive over
the years. You can load frequently used maps on several cards and not
bother with repeatedly uploading data from map program CDs. You can
easily pick up a 128MB memory card, which I’d recommend as a minimum
size, for under $40. I like to use Froogle (http://froogle.google.com)
to find the best prices online.
Figure 9-3:

iFINDER and

card.
161
Chapter 9: Interfacing a GPS Receiver to a Computer

 More storage: Memory cards give you considerably more storage than
GPS receivers with fixed amounts of internal memory. You can currently
purchase memory cards that provide between 8–512MB of data storage.
Handheld GPS receivers that don’t support memory cards might have
only 1–115MB of internal storage.
 Versatility: You can use the memory card in your PDA, digital camera,
and cellphone (if all the devices support the same type of card).
 Minimal settings: When using a memory card, you don’t need to worry
about COM ports, baud rates, and protocols when transferring data.
(However, if you’re using your GPS receiver with a laptop and cable con-
nected to a moving map program, you still have to contend with getting
all the settings just right.)
Here are a few drawbacks to GPS receivers that support memory cards:
 Added cost: They add a bit more cost to the receiver price because of
the built-in card reader and associated technology.
 Reader: You need a memory card reader connected to your computer to
transfer data back and forth between the GPS receiver. However, some
computers (notably laptops) have built-in card readers.
If your GPS receiver didn’t come with a card reader, any third-party
reader will work. These devices are inexpensive and easy to use. Just
plug the reader into a USB port, and Windows treats the memory card
like a hard drive or floppy disk. You can then copy data back and forth
between your hard drive and the memory card. Card readers are inex-
pensive, and you can purchase a basic model for under $20.
 Removal: Memory cards can be a little tedious to swap because you
need to remove the GPS receiver batteries to access the card slot.
Just like digitals cameras, GPS receivers that support memory cards usually
come with a card that has a relatively small amount of storage space (8–16MB).
In fact, if they both use the same type of memory card, you can swap a card
between your digital camera and GPS receiver. You’ll probably want to upgrade
to a larger capacity card. Blank memory cards with the GPS receiver manufac-
turer’s brand name tend to be more expensive than standard MMC and SD
cards. I don’t find any difference between the two, and you can save money
with third-party memory cards in your GPS receiver.
Transferring GPS Data
After you have a cable and then get the ports, baud rates, and protocols all
figured out (or have a memory card and card reader), the next step is getting
the data transferred between the GPS receiver and your computer. This is
where software comes in, and you generally have three options:
162
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

 GPS manufacturer software: The commercial mapping programs that
GPS receiver manufacturers sell can all upload and download waypoints,
routes, and tracks as well as upload maps to certain models of their GPS
receivers. (Using GPS manufacturer software packages and their features
is presented in Chapter 10.)
GPS receivers that display maps work only with proprietary maps pro-
vided by the manufacturer. You can’t upload maps from third-party map-
ping programs into your receiver. Sometimes GPS novices believe that
they can load maps from DeLorme, Maptech, National Geographic, or
other mapping companies directly into their GPS receiver. You can’t.
 Third-party mapping software: Most third-party, commercial map pro-
grams can also upload and download waypoints, routes, and tracks —
they just can’t upload a digital map that appears on your PC. This is an
essential feature so you can overlay GPS data on a digital map to see
where you’ve been or plan a trip with the mapping software and then
upload waypoints and routes from your computer to a GPS receiver.
 GPS utilities: Software programs used to interface GPS receivers to com-
puters are utility programs designed specifically to download and upload
waypoints, routes, tracks, and other information. These programs are
usually freeware or shareware and have a number of useful features.
GPS receiver interface programs tend to work the same way, although they
have different menus, dialog boxes, commands, and appearances.
When you transfer data between your GPS receiver and PC, you’ll either be
 Capturing current location coordinates to use with a real-time mapping
program you have running on your laptop (or PDA). As you move, your
location appears on the map.
 Downloading or uploading waypoints, routes, tracks, or map data.
The process to complete both of these tasks is the same. (If you have a GPS
receiver with a memory card, you don’t need a cable to download or upload
waypoints, routes, tracks, or map data because you’ll be using the memory
card and a card reader to do this. However, you’ll still need a cable to capture
your current location to use with a real-time mapping program.) Take a look
at the general steps involved in transferring data with a cable:
1. Connect the PC interface cable to your computer and to your GPS
receiver.
2. Turn on your GPS receiver.
The GPS receiver doesn’t need to have a satellite fix to transfer data
unless you’re using the receiver with a mapping program that’s plotting
your current location.
3. Run the interface program.
163
Chapter 9: Interfacing a GPS Receiver to a Computer

4. Ensure that the protocols and settings on both the GPS receiver and
the computer are the same.
See the earlier section, “Understanding Ports and Protocols.”
At this point you can
 Select the type of data (waypoints, routes, or tracks) and upload it to the
GPS receiver from your computer or download it from the GPS receiver
to your computer.
 Upload a map to the GPS receiver that was created with a GPS manufac-
turer’s mapping program.
 Have the GPS receiver start providing location data to the interface pro-
gram for real-time mapping.
164
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 
G7ToWin and other utilities
G7ToWin is the Swiss Army knife of the GPS
world. This free utility program works with most
all brands of popular GPS receivers. With this
Windows program, you can
 Upload waypoints, routes, and tracks to
your GPS receiver.
 Download waypoints, routes, and tracks to
your computer.
 Edit waypoint, route, and track data in a
spreadsheet-style window.
 Create waypoints, routes, and tracks.
 Save waypoints, routes, and tracks in dif-
ferent file types. (Remember that GPS
receiver and software manufacturers all
use a number of different file formats for
waypoints, routes, and tracks.)
 Save the image that appears onscreen of
many Garmin GPS receivers.
G7ToWin is a must for the serious GPS receiver
user. Its author, Ron Henderson, continues to
add new features to the program. DOS and
Pocket PC versions of the utility are also avail-
able. You can download G7ToWin at www.
gpsinformation.org/ronh.
Other GPS utilities worth consideration include
 EasyGPS: A popular, free utility for creating,
editing, and transferring waypoints and
routes, available at www.easygps.com.
 GPS Utility: A popular freeware/shareware
program that lets you manipulate and map
waypoints, routes, and tracks and works
with Geographic Information System (GIS)
data. It’s available at: www.gpsu.co.uk.
 GPS TrackMaker: A free utility that creates,
edits, and deletes waypoints, routes, and
tracks. It supports mapping features. You
can download the program at www.
gpstm.com.
 GPSy: For users who want to interface their
receiver with a Mac. For more information,
see www.gpsy.com.

Check the program’s user manual or online help for specific instructions on
transferring data between your GPS receiver and a PC. If the program can’t
connect to the GPS receiver, read through the “Troubleshooting Connection
Problems” section, later in this chapter.
If you’re transferring data to and from a memory card, refer to the GPS
receiver’s user manual or support Web site. With some receivers, you can
simply drag data between the memory card and the hard drive via Windows
Explorer. In other cases, you might need to use a utility program, such as
G7ToWin or EasyGPS. (See the sidebar, “G7ToWin and other utilities.”)
Troubleshooting Connection Problems
If you follow the instructions that come with the your software to connect
your GPS receiver to a computer, usually getting the two devices talking is
painless.
If you do run into problems, follow this set of steps, in this order, to help you
identify a possible culprit for your connection troubles:
1. Always make sure the cable is securely plugged in to both the GPS
receiver and the computer. While you’re at it, check that the GPS
receiver is turned on.
2. Make sure that the baud rate and the protocol are the same in both
the GPS receiver and the interface program. Double-check this again if
you can’t establish a connection.
Even if the baud rates match, they may be set too high — thus causing
communication errors. When in doubt, lower the baud rate. You can
either step-down a rate at a time or go directly to 4,800 or 9,600 baud.
Although this is slow, this rate shouldn’t generate errors.
3. In the interface program, make sure that the correct COM port is spec-
ified. If you can’t get a connection, try different COM port numbers until
you find one that works.
4. Always check the program’s user manual, online help, or support sec-
tion of the vendor’s Web site for specific information on interfacing
with a GPS receiver.
If you can’t get your GPS receiver to talk to your computer and you happen to
have a PDA, turn off the PDA synchronization program first. PDA synchro-
nization software that’s running in the background is a frequent culprit in
causing GPS receiver interface problems.
165
Chapter 9: Interfacing a GPS Receiver to a Computer

Uploading Firmware Revisions 
to Your GPS Receiver
Just like software vendors, GPS manufacturers find bugs and add enhance-
ments to their products. New versions of a GPS receiver’s operating system
can be upgraded through the receiver’s firmware (the updateable, read-only
software that’s embedded in a hardware device).
Check that your GPS receiver’s firmware is current every few months or so,
especially if your receiver is a newly released model. GPS manufacturers offer
free downloads of firmware upgrades on their Web sites, and these bug-fixes
or new features can definitely make your GPS receiver perform better.
To upgrade your firmware
1. Check the current version of your GPS receiver firmware.
Sometimes this is displayed when the GPS receiver is turned on, or it
might be shown on an information page. Consult your user’s guide or
the manufacturer’s Web site for specific instructions on how to get this
information for your model.
2. Visit the manufacturers’s Web site and go to the software updates 
section.
Here are the URLs of the major GPS manufacturers:
• Garmin: www.garmin.com
If you have a Garmin GPS receiver, you can sign up for automatic e-mail
notification of firmware upgrades at the Garmin Web site. I expect other
GPS manufacturers to start offering this service.
• Lowrance: www.lowrance.com
• Magellan: www.magellangps.com
3. Find your GPS receiver model and check its manufacturer’s Web site
for the latest firmware version.
If your firmware is older than the current version on the Web site, follow
the online instructions to download the firmware installer. Usually, the
higher the version number, the more recent the firmware version.
Make sure that the firmware installer you download is for your GPS
receiver model. If you upload firmware designed for a different model,
plan on the GPS receiver not working until you load the proper firmware.
4. Follow the installation instructions that come with the downloaded
file.
166
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Usually firmware installation files come in two forms:
 A standalone program that runs on your computer, connects to the GPS
receiver, and sends the upgraded firmware to the receiver. You need to
have a PC interface cable attached to both the computer and the GPS
receiver.
 A special file that you copy to a memory card. When the GPS receiver
starts, it searches the card to see whether a firmware upgrade is pre-
sent. If it is, the receiver uploads the upgrade. After the upgrade is suc-
cessful, you can erase the firmware upgrade file from the memory card.
Upgrading a GPS receiver’s firmware is pretty easy; not too much can go wrong.
About the only thing that can get you in trouble is if the GPS receiver’s batter-
ies die midway through a firmware upload. A firmware upgrade usually only
takes a few minutes to complete, but make sure that your batteries aren’t run-
ning on empty before you start.
Some firmware update software works only on COM ports 1 through 4. If
you’re using a USB adapter, (which is usually set to COM port 5 or higher) and
are having problems connecting to the GPS receiver, try reassigning the exist-
ing COM ports to numbers higher than the USB adapter’s port; then set the
adapter’s port number to 1. Refer to online Windows help (choose Start➪
Help) and perform a search for device manager to get more information on
changing device settings.

city locations, highways, major roads, bodies of water, and other features. (For
the lowdown on GPS receivers, see Chapter 5.) Precisely what the basemaps
display varies by manufacturer and model. Although base- maps do provide
general information, some GPS receiver users want more detailed maps that
show city streets, topographic features, marine navigation aids, or places
outside the United States.
The good news is you’re not limited to the basemap that came with your
GPS receiver: Most mapping GPS receivers allow you to upload more detailed
maps. These GPS receivers either have a fixed amount of internal memory
used to store the added maps, or they support external Secure Digital (SD) or
MultiMediaCard (MMC) memory cards for map storage. (Check product mar-
keting literature or the GPS receiver user manual for details on how many
megabytes of map data a particular model can store. More is always better.)
Different types of maps are available from GPS receiver manufacturers and
are sold on CD-ROMs, including street maps, topographic maps, fishing maps,
and nautical charts. These map products have software that you run on your
PC to install the maps, plan trips, and exchange data with your GPS receiver.
In this chapter, I discuss mapping software produced by the Big Three GPS
receiver manufacturers (Magellan, Lowrance, and Garmin). I also show you
the general features that all GPS map programs share as well as what kind of
maps are available for the different GPS receiver brands.

Understanding Universal Principles
of GPS Map Software
Take a look at some universal GPS map software principles that apply to all
map software offered by GPS receiver manufacturers. I’ll present the important
rules that relate to GPS receivers that display maps and then discuss some
common features all GPS receiver manufacturer software packages share.
Begin with the three rules of GPS receiver mapping software. If you’re consid-
ering purchasing a GPS receiver or mapping software, pay attention to these
rules to avoid hair-pulling frustration before or after shopping. Then I move
on to show you common GPS map software features and how to upload a
map to your GPS receiver.
Three rules of GPS mapping software
Consider these three basic tenets before you start to shop for GPS mapping
software.
 Not all GPS receivers can display maps. Lower-cost models (typically
under $150) or GPS receivers with very small screens usually don’t sup-
port maps. If you already own a GPS receiver, make sure that it’s compat-
ible with the map software you’re interested in using. Manufacturer Web
sites are pretty good about listing product compatibility. The same
holds true if you’re shopping for a new GPS receiver.
 You can use only proprietary products (made by the same company
that manufactures your GPS receiver). For example, you can’t use
Garmin maps on a Magellan GPS receiver. Likewise, you can’t use third-
party maps produced by DeLorme or Maptech on a Magellan GPS
receiver. Repeat after me, “You can only use Magellan maps on a
Magellan GPS receiver” (or whichever brand you happen to be using).
Admittedly, I’m belaboring this point, but a fair number of novice GPS
users think that they can load just about any map on their new GPS
receiver, which isn’t the case.
 Don’t expect the level of detail in a GPS map to match paper maps. In
order to maximize memory space, GPS receivers use vector maps (created
with lines and shapes) instead of raster maps (scanned paper maps). And
because a GPS receiver has a fairly small screen to display a map, don’t
expect the map on your GPS receiver to appear as an identical version of
your favorite paper map. Until GPS receivers incorporate science-fiction-
like, holographic projection systems where a map appears in midair (and
I’m not holding my breath), viewing a paper map will always be easier
and more effective than staring at a map on a GPS receiver.
170
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer

Keeping these three rules in mind when you go map shopping, you can gener-
ally expect to pay anywhere from $100–$150 for a map software product from
a GPS receiver manufacturer. You can easily avoid paying suggested retail for
map software if you exploit the Internet for dealers offering better prices.
Even if your GPS receiver doesn’t support maps, you can still use a manufac-
turer’s map program with your receiver to download and upload waypoints,
routes, and tracks, as well as access maps on your PC. However, I find that
the third-party products I discuss in Chapters 12 and 13 that can interface
with GPS receivers have more features and better maps when it comes to
PC use.
Common GPS map software features
Here are some of the features that all GPS receiver map software have in
common.
 Upload maps to GPS receivers: The main job of a mapping program on
your computer is to upload maps to your GPS receiver. The maps appear
the same on your computer and your GPS receiver screen although the
GPS receiver displays smaller portions of the map than you can view on
your computer screen. (And the map won’t appear in color if your
receiver has a monochrome display.) You use the mapping software to
select the portions of the maps that you want to upload to your GPS
receiver. (To read how to upload to your receiver, see the following
section.)
 Print from and use maps on your PC: In addition to uploading maps to
a GPS receiver, you can also use the map software on your PC to view
and print maps, measure distances, and plan trips.
 Download waypoints, routes, and tracks from GPS receivers: With GPS
mapping software, you can download information that you’ve recorded
with your GPS receiver, such as waypoints, routes, and tracks. You can
store this data on your PC’s hard drive or display it as an overlay on the
maps displayed on your PC. (Read how to create and use waypoints,
routes, and tracks in Chapter 4.)
 Upload waypoints, routes, and tracks to GPS receivers: In addition to
downloading GPS data, you can also upload waypoints, routes, and
tracks from your PC to a GPS receiver. For example, you can plot several
waypoint locations on the PC map and then transfer them to your GPS
receiver.
 View POIs: Many software packages have Points of Interest (POIs), such
as restaurants, gas stations, and geographic features shown on the maps
that you view with your PC or GPS receiver.
171
Chapter 10: Using GPS Manufacturer Mapping Software

Getting maps to GPS receivers
All GPS manufacturer map programs upload maps to your GPS receiver in
similar ways. Although the user interfaces are different and the commands
vary, you load a map onto a GPS receiver by using the same basic process.
1. Run the map program and zoom in on the area that you want to
upload to your GPS receiver.
2. Choose which parts of the map you want to upload to the GPS
receiver.
This usually means selecting one or more rectangular areas on the map.
Depending on the program, you either draw a rectangle that defines the
areas that you want to upload, or you select grid squares that appear on
the map that correspond to the areas you want to upload.
3. Connect your GPS receiver to your PC.
You use a special cable for this data transfer connection. To read more
on connecting your GPS receiver to a PC, go to Chapter 9.
If the GPS receiver uses a memory card to store maps, you can skip this
step.
4. Set the communications parameters in the map program.
This comprises the COM port, baud rate, and other settings that are
needed so that the GPS receiver can successfully communicate with your
PC. (Read how to do this in Chapter 9.) This is usually a one-time setup,
so you don’t need to repeat this each time you want to upload a map.
Again, you can skip this step if your GPS receiver uses a memory card.
5. Upload the map to your GPS receiver.
The program extracts the information that it needs from the map data
CD-ROM and builds a custom map of the area that you select. When this
process finishes, the program either starts uploading the map to the GPS
receiver or saves the map to your hard drive where you can copy it to a
memory card (if applicable).
How long building a map takes depends on the size of the area that you
select, how much map detail you want to include, and how fast your PC is.
This can range from a minute or less for small areas (such as a metropolitan
area) to five or ten minutes for a large map (such as one that includes many
different states). For example, when using Lowrance’s MapCreate, it takes a
little under five minutes to create a 26MB map of the state of Oklahoma and
the Texas panhandle on a typical PC that’s been manufactured within the
past several years.
How much time it takes to upload a map into a GPS receiver also depends on
the size of the area you select and how the receiver stores maps. If you’re
172
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer

uploading a large map from a PC via a serial cable, it can take hours to trans-
fer the map between a PC and your GPS receiver. GPS receivers that support
Universal Serial Bus (USB) communications are much faster. For GPS
receivers that use SD or MMC memory for storage, after the map has been
created and saved to the memory card, it’s just a matter of inserting the card
into the receiver.
After you purchase GPS receiver map software, be sure to check the manufac-
turer’s Web site every now and then to see whether updated releases of the
PC software are available. You may be able to download upgraded versions of
the program with bug fixes and enhanced features. Keep in mind that when
you download the program, updated map data doesn’t come with it.
Some GPS receiver manufacturers use different methods for stemming soft-
ware and map piracy. Both Garmin and Magellan use unlock codes on some of
their map products that require you to visit a Web page and get a code to
activate the program. Some map products (notably nautical charts) have
multiple regions stored on CD-ROM, and you need to purchase an unlock
code for each region you want to access. In addition, programs commonly
link the serial number of a GPS receiver to a map, meaning that the map will
work only with the GPS receiver that the map was originally uploaded to.
Reviewing GPS Manufacturer Software
GPS receiver manufacturers have a number of software products available for
their models that support maps. So you have a better understanding of what
types of maps are available, here are the different map software packages
that the major GPS receiver manufacturers offer. Read on to discover what
types of maps you can upload to the three main brands of GPS receivers. For
more information and in-depth reviews of GPS receiver manufacturer map
products, including screenshots, visit http://gpsinformation.net.
GPS receivers sold in different parts of the world typically have different
basemaps. For example, a GPS receiver sold in Germany will have a more
detailed basemap of Europe, compared with the same model of receiver sold
in the United States.
I want to clarify a point that sometimes confuses current or prospective GPS
receiver owners: Each of the major GPS receiver manufacturers has their own
line of map products that all sound pretty similar. Here they are:
Magellan (www.magellangps.com) MapSend
Lowrance (www.lowrance.com)
MapCreate
Garmin (www.garmin.com)
MapSource
173
Chapter 10: Using GPS Manufacturer Mapping Software

MapSend, MapCreate, and MapSource all refer to the respective PC programs
that allow you to view maps on your PC, upload maps to your GPS receiver,
and manage GPS waypoints, routes, and tracks. Magellan, Lowrance, and
Garmin ship these programs with their respective map products. Just remem-
ber that MapSend, MapCreate, and MapSource are not maps nor map data
but simply the programs that interface the map data.
In addition to map products, several GPS manufacturers sell waypoint and
route management software. If you don’t care about uploading maps but want
to transfer and save waypoints, routes, and tracks, I recommend using the
free G7ToWin program (which works with most all GPS receivers) that you
can download at www.gpsinformation.org/ronh.
Some manufacturers offer GPS receivers bundled with map software and
other accessories. These bundled products are usually cheaper than sepa-
rately purchasing the GPS hardware and map software, so shop around.
Just like any other software line, GPS receiver manufacturers roll out new
products, drop outdated ones, and add new features to existing products. Be
sure to check the manufacturer’s Web site to get the latest information on
what map software is available for a particular model of GPS receiver.
Magellan MapSend
Magellan manufactures the popular Meridian and SporTrak GPS receiver
lines. The Meridian receivers use memory cards for map storage, and the
SporTrak models have a fixed amount of internal memory to store maps. (You
can upload maps to all SporTraks with the exception of the basic model.)
Software products that you can use with Magellan mapping GPS receivers
include the following. Information about all these products is available at the
Magellan Web site.
 MapSend DirectRoute: This software package provides street maps,
POIs, automated street routing, and turn-by-turn directions for most
Meridian and SporTrak receivers. With automated street routing (also
called autorouting), you can enter a starting and destination street
address, and the GPS receiver will provide you with a route, including
street directions. Most GPS receivers give you a straight-line route
between two points, but Magellan upgraded the firmware on a number
of their receivers to support both straight-line and street routes when
MapSend DirectRoute maps are uploaded. Versions of the software are
available for the United States, major cities in Canada, and Europe. The
MapSend DirectRoute PC user interface is shown in Figure 10-1.
174
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer

 MapSend BlueNav charts: These are nautical charts with detailed
coverage areas and enhanced marine navigation information, such as
currents, tides, and port services. Charts, available for a number of
coastal areas in North America and Europe, can be purchased on
CD-ROM or preloaded SD memory cards.
 MapSend Topo: The Topo product is designed for outdoor recreation
use and features 1:100,000 scale topographic maps of the United States,
including trails, roads, rivers, lakes, coastlines, and POIs. After you
upload the maps, you can display elevation profiles on your GPS
receiver for roads, trails, and user-created routes.
 MapSend Streets & Destinations: Magellan’s original road map software
package has versions available for the United States and Canada. If you’re
looking for street navigation software for your Magellan, I recommend
MapSend DirectRoute because of its autorouting features and more cur-
rent NAVTECH maps. Choose Streets & Destinations if you have an older
GPS receiver that isn’t compatible with DirectRoute or if you’re on a
tight budget. (Streets & Destinations is a bit cheaper than DirectRoute.)
 MapSend Streets Europe: Magellan also offers street-level maps of
Europe for its GPS receivers. Like with Streets & Destinations (see the
Figure 10-1:
Magellan
MapSend
DirectRoute
street map
software.
175
Chapter 10: Using GPS Manufacturer Mapping Software

preceding bullet), if your GPS receiver is compatible with DirectRoute,
I suggest going with the European version.
 MapSend WorldWide Basemap: This map software package expands
your GPS receiver’s built-in basemap coverage to other international
regions. Each basemap region has basic map features such as cities,
highways, waterways, railroads, national boundaries, and shorelines.
Don’t expect street-level detail, but there’s enough information to help
you get around.
Check periodically for current information about Magellan map products;
go to www.magellangps.com.
Lowrance MapCreate
Lowrance was the first manufacturer to offer a GPS receiver with uploadable
maps. (For you trivia buffs, it was the GlobalMap100, which first came out in
April, 1998.) The company continues the electronic map tradition with its
current line of iFINDER handheld GPS receivers; which use memory cards to
store maps.
If you own a Lowrance GPS receiver or are considering purchasing one, here
are the map products you can use:
 MapCreate: MapCreate is Lowrance’s primary map program for creating
GPS receiver maps of the United States. (See the MapCreate user inter-
face in Figure 10-2.) In addition to street maps and points of interest,
MapCreate also has an extensive database of navigation aids, wrecks, and
obstructions for marine use. One nice feature of MapCreate is that you
can select polygon map regions to upload, which maximizes map storage
space. Although MapCreate currently doesn’t offer autorouting and turn-
by-turn directions, Lowrance does plan to offer this feature in the future.
Several versions of MapCreate are available. If you’re using an iFINDER
GPS receiver, be sure you get Version 6 or later.
 FreedomMaps: In addition to maps on CD-ROM, Lowrance also offers
the FreedomMaps product line, comprising memory cards preloaded
with maps of the United States, Europe, and Canada. Regional maps
come on 128MB and 256MB memory cards that you just plug into your
GPS receiver; no software or CD-ROMs are required.
 Navionics charts: Navionics (www.navionics.com) is one of the largest
producers of electronic nautical charts. Navionics Gold and Classic
charts and fishing HotMaps are all available on MMC memory cards and
are also compatible with the iFINDER Pro GPS receiver.

Chapter 10: Using GPS Manufacturer Mapping Software
Do-it-yourself maps
For the most part, GPS manufacturers have a
lock on the market when it comes to maps that
can be uploaded to their receivers. GPS
receiver owners must use proprietary maps dis-
tributed by the manufacturers.
However, a small group of technically adept
GPS and map enthusiasts have found ways
around this map monopoly. They have created
free tools such as GPSMapEdit and Mapdekode
with which Garmin GPS receiver owners can
create their own maps and upload them to their
receivers. Similar projects are under way for
Magellan GPS receivers.
At the present, creating your own do-it-yourself
GPS receiver maps is a somewhat compli-
cated process, but a number of tutorials are
available on the Internet. (Here’s one for starters: 
www.gpstm.com/eng/dekode_eng.htm.)
If you’re really interested in this topic, check out
the Yahoo! Group devoted to GPS map author-
ing at groups.yahoo.com/group/map_
authors.

Garmin MapSource
Like the other GPS receiver manufacturers, Garmin offers a number of different
types of maps for its products. Unlike Magellan and Lowrance, however, Garmin
doesn’t use memory cards in its current line of handheld GPS receivers. Any
maps that you upload must be able to fit into whatever fixed memory the GPS
receiver has available for storage. (The amount of fixed memory depends on
the model, with high-end, handheld GPS receivers sporting between 56–115MB
of memory.)
Although Garmin doesn’t use commonly available SD or MMC memory cards
in its GPS models, the company is using newer technology to make uploading
maps quicker. Recent Garmin products feature USB connectivity, which is
considerably faster than uploading a map to a GPS receiver through a PC
serial port.
If you own a Garmin GPS receiver or are considering purchasing one, here are
some of the mapping software packages that you can use. Detailed informa-
tion about all is available from the Garmin Web site.
 MapSource City Select: City Select contains street maps and points of
interest and is designed to work with Garmin GPS receivers that support
autorouting (turn-by-turn street directions), such as the GPSMAP 196 and
GPSMAP 60C/60CS. (If you own a GPS V or iQue 3600, this software came
bundled with your GPS receiver.) The three versions of the product are
available for North America, Europe, and South Africa.
 MapSource MetroGuide: MetroGuide is similar to City Select but is
designed for Garmin GPS receivers that don’t support autorouting (such
as the eTrex Legend and Vista). Four versions of this product are avail-
able, providing street maps for the United States, Canada, Australia, and
Europe.
 MapSource WorldMap: This software provides basic international maps
that expand the default basemap coverage that comes with your GPS
receiver.
GPS receivers sold in different parts of the world typically have different
basemaps.
 MapSource BlueChart: BlueChart products are Garmin’s nautical charts
and are available in regional versions that cover the Americas as well as
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
 Fishing Hot Spots: Fishing Hot Spots are maps of popular fishing areas
in North America with depth contours, shoreline details, boat ramp
information, and fishing tips. The maps are sold for multistate regions.
178
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer

 Minnesota LakeMaster ProMap: Designed specifically for GPS receiver
owners who fish in the Minnesota area, this map product has maps of
popular lakes and includes three-foot contours with underwater struc-
ture detail, islands, reefs, points, bays, access points, and marinas.
 MapSource U.S. TOPO: The TOPO product contains 1:100,000 scale
maps of the United States and shows terrain contours, elevation, trails,
roads, and summits. It’s designed for outdoor recreational use. (The
MapSource TOPO user interface is shown in Figure 10-3.)
 MapSource U.S. TOPO 24K: 24K doesn’t refer to gold but rather to
1:24,000 scale maps, which have significantly more detail than the maps
found in MapSource TOPO. The maps provide detailed coverage of U.S.
national parks and surrounding national forest lands. Points of interest
and park amenities are also included. Two versions of the product are
available: National Parks, East and National Parks, West.

MapSource on the Web
If you use a Garmin GPS receiver and are inter-
ested in seeing what maps from the different map
products look like — or to check out the amount
of detail and coverage for certain areas — visit
www.garmin.com/cartography and check
out the MapSource Map Viewer.
Choose any of Garmin’s map products from a
drop-down list, and the selected map is shown
in your Web browser. After the map is dis-
played, you can move around the map and zoom
in and out. What you see on your PC monitor is
what you can generally expect to see on your
GPS receiver if you upload that particular map
product. Remember that your GPS receiver
screen is smaller; and, if it doesn’t support color,
the map will be displayed in monochrome.
Even if you don’t use a Garmin GPS receiver, this
Web site is useful for getting a better idea of the
types of maps that are available for GPS
receivers, their general appearance, and what
information they show.

Finding Places and Coordinates
In This Chapter
 Using online gazetteers
 Converting coordinates
W
hen you start using a GPS receiver, you’ll soon discover that it’s pretty
numbers-oriented. There’s time, speed, distance, altitude, and (of
course) the location coordinates. But quite often you’ll want names to go
with those numbers. Or you might need to convert those coordinate num-
bers into another format. That’s where this chapter comes in. Read here to
discover how to locate places by their names and get their coordinates (and
other information) and how to easily convert coordinates from one coordi-
nate system to another.
Finding Your Way with Online Gazetteers
Sometimes you need a little bit more information about a location.
 You know a place name, but you don’t know exactly where the place is
located.
 You’ve heard about a place but don’t know whether it’s a mountain peak,
a river, or a town.
 You generally know where a place is, but you need the exact latitude and
longitude or Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.
In these cases, you can turn to a gazetteer, which is a collection of place
names with such useful data as geographic coordinates, elevation, and fea-
ture type. Gazetteers are usually published as books, but digital versions are
available. The U.S. government has two free online gazetteer services:
 GNIS provides information about places in the United States.
 GNS has information about locations all over the world.

Using the Geographic Names
Information System (GNIS)
The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) is the federal repository
of geographic name information. The database contains information on
nearly 2 million physical and cultural geographic features in the United States
and its territories: a city, dam, island, school, or any other designated feature
type. You can search for feature information at the GNIS Web site: http://
geonames.usgs.gov.
The GNIS search page has a number of different data fields (as shown in
Figure 11-1) that you can use to narrow down your search, including
 Feature Name: This is the name of the feature you’re looking for. This
can be either the whole name or a part of the name.
Feature name searches aren’t case sensitive.
 Query Variant Name?: Some features have other names in addition to
their primary name. If you select the Yes radio button, records with
matched variant names are displayed.
 State or Territory: From this drop-down list, select the state or territory
where the feature is located.
Figure 11-1:

 County Name: If you click the County Name button, a drop-down list box
shows all the counties in the currently selected state.
If you know the county where the feature is located, enter it to speed up
your search.
 Feature Type: The Feature Type drop-down list box contains all the fea-
ture types, such as bridges, canals, lakes, and populated places. If you
know what the feature is, select its type.
 Elevation Range: The Elevation Range text boxes let you search for fea-
tures that occur at a certain height range; use feet when entering the
range values.
 Topo Map Name: You can confine a search to features only found within
a United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute topographic map
by entering the map’s exact name.
Follow these steps to perform a basic search for a feature:
1. Go to the GNIS Web site at http://geonames.usgs.gov.
2. Click the Query GNIS: U.S. and Territories link.
3. Enter the feature name that you want to search for in the Feature
Name text box.
4. From the State or Territory drop-down list box, select the state where
the feature is located.
5. Click the Send Query button.
183
Chapter 11: Finding Places and Coordinates
Finding street address coordinates
Commercial services can provide the informa-
tion latitude and longitude of a particular street
address, such as www.geocode.com (you can
test drive their Eagle geocoding technology for
free), but here’s also another free and easy
method:
1. Go to the www.terra-server-usa.com
site and enter a street address.
2. Select an aerial photo of the location.
An aerial photo displaying the street
address of the location is displayed with a
pushpin icon shown on top of the address.
3. When the photo is displayed, click the Info
link at the top of the page.
A grid appears over the aerial photo with
the latitude and longitude coordinates of the
address.
The accuracy of this information varies, but
usually it puts you in the general vicinity of the
address you want. If you really want precise
information, visit the address with a GPS
receiver and record the coordinates.

The more you narrow a search, the faster it is. For example, if you know the
county where a feature is located, select it. If you don’t know much informa-
tion about the feature, be patient. The GNIS server can be pretty slow.
If GNIS finds any records that match your search criteria, it lists all the
matching features. Figure 11-2 shows that a search for Horse Butte found
three matches. Information about the features includes
 Feature name
 State
 County
 Feature type
 Latitude and longitude
 USGS 7.5 minute map that the feature appears on
If you aren’t sure which result you need, use this information to narrow your
search.

After you pick a feature, click its Feature Name link to display more informa-
tion. A new page (as shown in Figure 11-3) displays additional information
including:
 Elevation: The elevation of the feature is displayed in feet.
 TopoZone.com link: Clicking this link goes to the TopoZone.com Web
site and shows the feature location on a USGS topographic map.
 FIPS55 Place Code: Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 55
contains codes for named populated places, primary county divisions,
and other locations in the United States. Click this link to display the
FIPS55 code for the location; unless you know that you need this, the
code isn’t very relevant for the average user.
 Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) link: Click this link to display the feature
location on a digitized version of a USGS topographic map; supplied by
www.terraserver-usa.com.
 Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle (DOQ) link: Click this link to display a
black-and-white aerial photograph of the feature location, supplied by

area prepared from U.S. Census Bureau data.
 Watershed: Click this link to visit U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) maps and information about the watershed where the feature is
located.
You need an Internet connection to access the GNIS database. In addition to
the online search capabilities at the GNIS Web site, you can download text
files of all the features and associated information for each state. The files are
quote- and comma-delimited and can be opened with your own databases
and spreadsheets. The files come in compressed and uncompressed formats;
if you have a slow Internet connection, download the Zip files.
Ever wanted to name a mountain or another land feature after yourself or a
loved one? The U.S. Board on Geographic Names is responsible for naming
and renaming features that appear on USGS maps. If there’s an unnamed
geographic feature, you can propose a new name for it (or suggest a name
change for an existing feature). The Board even has an online form that you
can fill out. Submitting the form doesn’t guarantee you’ll automatically get
some peak named after Uncle Harry; this is a rather big deal. For instructions
on filling out the online form see http://geonames.usgs.gov/dgnp/
dgnp.html.

Chapter 11: Finding Places and Coordinates

Using the GEOnet Name Server (GNS)
The GEONet Name Server (GNS) searches for features around the world. GNS
is located at http://earth-info.nima.mil/gns/html/index.html.
The database contains over 3.5 million features and over 5 million place
names for locations outside of the United States. The military relies on GNS
for its operations, so the database is updated every other week.
GNS is primarily designed for military use. Some of the search criteria and
information in the database isn’t very useful to the average civilian. At best
expect to find these types of information for a given feature:

 Type
 Latitude and longitude

Chapter 11: Finding Places and Coordinates

For GNS advanced searches, you can enter an extensive list of feature types as
part of your search criteria. These include oil pipelines, refugee camps, and
vegetation types. Other options limit searches by the latitude and longitude
boundaries of a rectangle, use special character sets from foreign languages,
and use government and military codes as part of the search. If you want to
run these advanced searches, the GNS Web site has links with explanations.
If GNS finds records that match your search criteria, the features appear on a
new page. A number of pieces of information are displayed (as shown in
Figure 11-5). For the average civilian user, the most useful data includes
 Name of the feature.
 Region of the world where the feature is located. Click the link to get an
explanation of the abbreviation.
 Designation: The feature type (such as populated locality, farm, or reser-
voir). Click the link to get the definition of the abbreviation.
 Latitude and longitude coordinates.
 Area: Country and state or province information for the feature. Click
the link for the meaning of the code.
You can also download tab-delimited text files from the GNS Web site for any
country that contain features and information. This data can easily be
imported into spreadsheets and databases.

Waypoint repositories
A number of Web sites provide waypoints that
you can upload to your GPS receiver. (A way-
point is a set of coordinates for a location.) With
these waypoint repositories, you can search a
region or for a feature name for its waypoints in
a database. If a waypoint has been logged in the
site database, you can download the waypoint
and then upload the coordinates to your GPS
receiver. Some of the waypoint sites include
 http://wayhoo.com: This site converts
GNIS and GNS feature information into
waypoints. There are also coordinates for
airports and a database where users can
upload waypoints.
 www.travelbygps.com: This site holds
a collection of waypoints for interesting
places all over the world, including photos
and descriptions. The site has an extensive
collection of links to Web sites with special
interest waypoints.
 www.trailregistry.com: This is a
waypoint collection dedicated to hikers and
backpackers.
 www.trailwaypoints.com: This is a
GPS repository site that collects recreation-
oriented waypoints from all over the world.

Converting Coordinates
Sometimes you might need to convert from one coordinate system to
another. For example, you might have coordinates in latitude and longitude
and a map with a UTM grid. Although there are many algorithms that you can
use to convert data, let conversion utilities do all the work for you.
Using GeoTrans
GeoTrans is a popular, free Windows program developed by the Department
of Defense (DoD). (GeoTrans is shown in Figure 11-6.) You can convert coor-
dinates from many coordinate systems and datums. GeoTrans is available for
download at http://earth-info.nima.mil/GandG/geotrans/geotrans.
htm.
Follow these steps to convert between coordinate systems with GeoTrans:
1. Select the map datum used with the coordinates from the drop-down
Datum list.
2. Select the coordinate system from the drop-down list below the
datum.
Figure 11-5:

189
Chapter 11: Finding Places and Coordinates

Use Geodetic if you’re converting from latitude and longitude.
3. Enter the coordinates in the appropriate text boxes.
• If you’ve converting from latitude and longitude, enter the 
coordinates.
• If you’re converting from UTM, enter the Zone, Hemisphere,
Northing, and Easting.
4. In the lower part of the window, select the datum and the coordinate
system that you want to convert to.
5. Click the Convert Upper→Lower button.
The converted coordinates appear in the lower part of the window.
GeoTrans’ Help file covers these advanced features if you need them:
 Converting datums used in foreign countries
 Determining distance errors when converting between maps and scales

Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer

Using online conversion utilities
If you don’t need to convert coordinates on a regular basis, you can save
some hard drive space by using a Web-based coordinate conversion utility
instead of installing GeoTrans. Most conversion sites are pretty straightfor-
ward to use; just enter the coordinate values that you want to convert and
click a button. These sites are a few of the most popular:
 For simple datum, latitude and longitude, and UTM coordinate conver-
sions: http://jeeep.com/details/coord
 For latitude and longitude, UTM, and Township and Range conversions:

Chapter 11: Finding Places and Coordinates
The Graphical Locator
The Environmental Statistics Group at Montana
State University hosts a very powerful online
tool called the Graphical Locator. It’s a cross
between a gazetteer and a coordinate utility
converter. Some of its features are
 A map of the United States that shows coor-
dinate information when you click a loca-
tion. You can zoom in on regional and state
maps. (The maps only show geographic
features, not feature names.)
 Coordinate conversion utilities for latitude
and longitude, UTM, and township, range,
and section.
 Extensive information on selected locations,
including latitude and longitude; township,
range, and section; UTM; elevation; state
and country; nearest named features and
distances; and USGS 7.5 minute topo-
graphic map name.
The Graphical Locater is designed to work with
locations within the United States. It’s fairly easy
to use; its author, D.L. Gustafson, has extensive
online documentation on the utility.
I use the Graphical Locator for quickly getting
rough latitude and longitude coordinates of a
location. Because there are no place names on
the online maps, I consult a paper map with
place names to zero in where I want to get loca-
tion information if I’m unfamiliar with the terrain.
To check out the Graphical Locator, visit

 Reviewing other street navigation programs
I
n the pre-PC days, taking a trip across town, a state, or the country to visit
someplace you’d never been before often involved planning worthy of a
major expedition. You’d have to carefully check maps, trying to figure out the
shortest and fastest routes, guessing when and where you’d need to stop for
gas, scribbling down notes, and highlighting roads on paper maps.
That’s all changed with inexpensive and easy-to-use street navigation software.
Just run a program on your PC and enter the address of your starting point
and the final destination. Then, a few mouse clicks later, you’ve got both a
map and exact turn-by-turn directions for how to get from Point A to Point B.
And as an added bonus, if you have a laptop and GPS receiver, you can take
this software on the road with you, track your location in real-time, and get
helpful hints in reaching your destination. (Most street navigation programs
also have versions that run on PDAs for ultimate portability.) Several street
navigation software packages are on the market that can keep you from get-
ting lost. They all generally work the same, with the primary differences in
the user interface and support of advanced features.
If you’ve never used a street navigation program before, this chapter gets you
moving in the right direction. I focus on DeLorme’s Street Atlas USA, showing
you its basic features and how to use them.

Discovering Street Atlas USA Features
Like other street navigation software, Street Atlas USA displays road maps of
the United States, finds addresses, and creates routes between two or more
points. Check out a few other program features that are important to know
about.
 POIs: All street navigation programs contain extensive databases of POIs.
POIs refer to Points of Interest, not to Hawaiian side dishes made from taro
root. POIs include restaurants (some of which might serve poi), hotels,
parks, gas stations, and other locations you might be interested in while
traveling. Street Atlas USA has a POI database that contains over four
million businesses, services, and organizations.
 Voice support: If you’re using a laptop and GPS receiver as part of a car
navigation system, Street Atlas USA can give you voice instructions when
you need to turn to reach your destination. You can also use a voice
recognition feature to give Street Atlas USA commands instead of using
a keyboard or mouse.
 Routable roads: A big issue that all map companies face is ensuring that
their road data is accurate, which can be very challenging considering
the number of new roads that are built every year. Street Atlas USA has a
feature that allows you to draw in roads that are missing on a map. After
you create a road, Street Atlas USA can use it when calculating routes.
 Customizable maps: Street Atlas USA has an extensive collection of draw-
ing tools for customizing maps with symbols, shapes, and text annotations.
Street Atlas USA has many more features than I can cover in the space of this
chapter (such as measuring distances and trip planning that takes fuel con-
sumption as well as the number of hours spent driving into consideration).
To find out more about all the program’s features, visit www.delorme.com.
Street Atlas USA comes on two CD-ROMs: one with the installation program
and files, and the other with map data files. By default, you need to insert the
map data CD-ROM each time you use the program. If you have enough space,
you can copy the map data files to your hard drive; see the online Help for
instructions.
Navigating Street Atlas USA
The first thing that you notice about Street Atlas USA is that it doesn’t use a
familiar Windows, menu-based user interface. DeLorme uses a unique user
interface with its mapping programs; after you get the hang of it, it’s pretty
easy to use. I walk you through the user interface and then show you how to
move around inside a map.
194
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Be sure to quickly browse through the PDF help file that comes with Street
Atlas USA, which you can access by clicking the HELP button at the top of the
window. Street Atlas USA has a rich set of commands, often offering you sev-
eral different ways to perform a single task or operation.
Exploring the Street Atlas USA interface
The Street Atlas USA user interface is made up of four different parts (as shown
in Figure 12-1). They include the
 Map: The main map takes up most of the screen and is where all the
action takes place. You’ll find roads, bodies of water, parks, businesses
and services, and other features displayed.
 Control Panel: The Control Panel, located to the right of the map, 
contains commands for moving around in the map and zooming in 
and out.
 Tab functions and options: Primary mapping commands and options
are underneath the map in a series of tab items. For example, click the
Find tab for searching commands and options.
You can shrink the size of the Tab area to show more map area by 
clicking the down-arrow icon in the right corner of the Tab area. If 
the Tab area has been minimized, clicking any tab will automatically
expand it.
 Overview Map: The Overview Map appears to the right of the Tab area
and contains a small map with a larger overview of the main map that
you’re viewing.

Chapter 12: On the Road with DeLorme Street Atlas USA
Complete campgrounds
Street Atlas USA is popular with RV owners who
travel across the United States. With a laptop
and a GPS receiver, you’ve got your own personal
navigation system for vacations and touring.
And if you’re a male (cough), you significantly
reduce the chances of getting lost and being
forced to ask for directions.
A POI database is a friendly traveling companion,
but if you’re an RV-er, you can supplement it with
even more useful information.
The Discovery Motorcoach Owners Association
Web site has an extensive list of U.S. and Canada
campgrounds, including Wal-Mart and Costco
locations, which you can import into Street Atlas
USA and other mapping programs.
To download the free campground database
and get complete instructions on how to load it
into Street Atlas USA, go to www.discovery
owners.com/cginfo.htm.

You can customize the Tab area by clicking the HELP button in the window
title and selecting the Tab Manager menu item. Use the Tab Manager to show,
hide, or reorder the tabs.
Zooming in and out
With Street Atlas USA, you can view the entire United States and then zoom in
for street-level detail. As you zoom in, the Data Zoom level, which is displayed
at the top of the Control Panel, increases. Data Zoom level 2–0 shows the
entire U.S., and Data Zoom level 16–0 shows the maximum amount of detail
for a location.
Beneath the Data Zoom are three buttons that control zooming. These but-
tons, each with red arrows and pictures of the Earth, are from left to right
 Zoom out three levels: Click the button with three arrows pointing away
from Earth.
 Zoom out: Click the button with the red arrow pointing away from Earth.
 Zoom in: Click the button with the red arrow pointing toward Earth.
Figure 12-1:

196
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

In addition to the zoom buttons, DeLorme also uses Octave controls, which
are up and down arrows next to the Zoom Data level value, allowing you to
have finer control over zooming in and out. Click the up arrow to zoom out;
click the down arrow to zoom in.
When you click an Octave control, notice that the Zoom Data level number
changes. The number to the right of the dash next to the Zoom Data level is the
octave value. For example, if the current Zoom Data level were 12-3, clicking
the Octave down arrow would zoom in and change the value to 12-4. (Octaves
range between 0 and 7, just like a diatonic music scale.)
You can also zoom in on a specific area by holding down the left mouse button
and dragging down and to the right. This draws a rectangle and will zoom in
to that area when you release the mouse button. You can zoom out by holding
down the left mouse button and dragging up and to the left.
Moving around in Street Atlas USA
Mouse around a little inside a Street Atlas USA map. Notice that as you move
the cursor around, information appears on the lower edge of the map. Anytime
you move the cursor over a map feature, whether it’s a road, river, or even
some open space, a line of text appears at the bottom of the map with a brief
description of the feature.
The numbers in parentheses that appear before a street name description
show the range of street addresses in the general vicinity of the cursor. This
is handy for getting a quick idea of addresses on a particular street.
You’re probably going to want to see more map than what appears on the
screen, and Street Atlas USA has several ways to move the map, including
 Centering: Click a location to center the map over the cursor.
 Dragging: Whenever you move the cursor to the edge of the map, it
turns into a hand icon. Hold the left mouse button down and drag the
map to scroll.
 Arrow keys: You can use Alt+ the keyboard arrow keys to move the map
in the direction of the arrow key you pressed.
 Compass Rose: In the Control Panel, beneath the zoom tools, is the
Compass Rose. This is a series of nine buttons with yellow arrows. Click
a button to scroll the map in the direction of the arrow.
If you click the middle button in the Compass Rose, the previously viewed
map is displayed. You can view up to the last 256 previously displayed maps
by clicking this button.
197
Chapter 12: On the Road with DeLorme Street Atlas USA

Getting POI information
Getting Point of Interest information from Street Atlas USA is a snap. 
Here’s how.
When you zoom in to level 15, you start to see POIs on the map, such as
restaurants, gas stations, theaters, hotels, and other businesses and services.
At Zoom Data level 16, symbols appear that let show you what the POI is. For
example, a plate with a fork and knife means a restaurant.
If you don’t know what a symbol means, click the HELP button in the window
title and choose Map Legend from the menu to display a list of all the map
symbols and their meanings.
When you move the cursor over a POI, the business or service name, its
phone number (if available), and the type of POI are shown at the bottom of
the map. You can also get more information about a POI (or any map feature)
by moving the cursor over the POI, right-clicking, and choosing Info from the
pop-up menu. Information about the POI appears in the Tab area, which you
can view by clicking the Info tab, as shown in Figure 12-2.
Figure 12-2:
Find POI
information
on the 
Info tab.
198
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Don’t treat the POI database like an up-to-date phone directory. If you look up
restaurants, gas stations, and other businesses in your city, you’ll probably
find a few listed that are out of business and others that are missing. DeLorme
and other map companies try to keep POI data as current as possible, but
because businesses come and go so often, it’s difficult to keep up with all the
changes.
Finding an Address with 
Street Atlas USA
Whenever I’m in San Francisco, I always try to visit Sam Wo’s, my favorite
authentic, Chinese noodle joint, located smack-dab in the middle of Chinatown.
Anytime I hear about friends or acquaintances heading to San Francisco, I
always tell them to head downtown and check out this famous Chinese fixture.
It’s been around for 100 years, Kerouac and Ginsberg hung out there, and it
was home to arguably the rudest waiter in the world.
If you don’t know San Francisco, finding this restaurant can be challenging.
And even if you can get around the City by the Bay fairly well, giving precise
directions to visitors can also be a little demanding. This is where street 
navigation programs like Street Atlas USA really shine. As an example of find-
ing a location and creating a map to get to it, here’s how to find Sam Wo’s
restaurant:
1. Click the Find tab and then click the QuickSearch button.
You can perform several different types of searches, but this is a simple
QuickSearch. (I talk about Advanced searches and Radar in a minute.)
The Find tab options and commands are shown in Figure 12-3.
2. In the Search For text box, enter the address you want to find.
Sam Wo’s restaurant is located at 813 Washington Street, 94108. You can
enter the city and state along with the address, but if you know the ZIP
code, it’s quicker and easier to use it instead.
3. Click the Search button.
Street Atlas USA searches through map and street data; if the address 
is valid, a map of the location is displayed. In this case, Sam Wo’s 
is exactly where I remembered it to be. See the resulting map in 
Figure 12-4.

Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

In addition to a QuickSearch, which is great for basic searches involving
places, addresses, ZIP codes, and coordinates, you’ll find two other options
in the Find tab:
 Advanced searches: As the name suggests, this option performs more
detailed, advanced searches. You can search by categories (such as 
rest areas, schools, and parks) as well as specify searches take place
within a certain area (such as a ZIP code, county, or the current dis-
played map).
 Radar searches: This is cool feature that lets you search for travel-
related POIs within a certain distance of the current center of the 
map — or if you’re using a GPS receiver with Street Atlas USA, from 
your current location. For example, you could request, “Find me all 
the restaurants within one mile,” and a list of nearby restaurants would
be displayed. When you click a restaurant in the list, Street Atlas USA
draws a route on the map showing you how to get to the restaurant 
and tells you the address, how far away it is, and how long it will take 
to arrive.
Getting from Here to There 
with Street Atlas USA
Knowing the address of someplace and where it’s located is a start, but getting
there in a timely fashion without getting lost or frustrated is the true test of a
driver (or his or her navigator).
One of the benefits of street navigation software is that it can automatically
generate a route between two or more points. The software examines the roads
between your starting point and destination, measuring distance and factoring
in speed limits to select either the shortest or fastest route.
Street navigation software can give you only its best guess when it comes 
to a route. A program can’t account for new roads that were built after the
map data was compiled or local traffic patterns. You’ll probably be able to
find faster and more direct routes in cities based on your own local knowl-
edge and experience. Although routes from software might not always 
be perfect, they’re much more accurate than guessing or driving around 
aimlessly.
Street Atlas USA has a number of powerful options for creating routes. To give
you a better idea of how route finding works, start off simple.
201
Chapter 12: On the Road with DeLorme Street Atlas USA

Creating a route
If you’ve followed the chapter to this point, you can use the example map cre-
ated in the earlier section, “Finding an Address with Street Atlas USA.” Suppose
I want to give my friends this map of Chinatown, showing where Sam Wo’s
restaurant is located. Great, but that’s not going to be much help if they’ve
just arrived at the airport and are driving into the city. For their needs, I use
Street Atlas USA to create a route for them to follow to noodle nirvana.
1. Click the Route tab.
2. In the Start text box, enter your starting address.
I use a cool Street Atlas USA feature that lets you use the three-letter
code of an airport. I enter SFO, which is the code for San Francisco
International Airport.
3. For the destination, enter the address in the Finish text box.
Here, I enter Sam Wo’s address: 813 Washington Street, 94108.
When you enter a ZIP code as part of the search, Street Atlas USA removes
the ZIP code from the Finish text box when the calculated route is dis-
played. The ZIP is required for the search but isn’t shown with the route.
4. Click the Calculate button.
Presto! A map appears with an outlined route from the airport to Sam
Wo’s, as shown in Figure 12-5. The route distance is shown as well as an
estimate of how long it will take to get there.
Remember that your Calculate result is based on driving the speed limit with
a normal amount of traffic. You can zoom in on the map to get more detail.
On all street navigation software, you’ll find that the travel times for routes
tend to be conservative estimates. Nine times out of ten, you end up taking
less time to reach your destination.
Getting directions
Maps with highlighted routes are pretty cool, but sometimes it’s nice to have
a set of plain old turn right on Main Street, then take a left at the light directions.
After you create a route (see the preceding section), Street Atlas USA can pro-
vide you with turn-by-turn directions to get to your destination.
202
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

On the Route tab, click the Directions button. You’ll get a list of turn-by-turn
directions with street names, distances, and total times for each part of the
route. The directions information is shown in Figure 12-6.
Printing and saving directions
After you have a map and driving directions (read earlier sections to follow
me to Sam Wo’s), you may need to make copies. Street Atlas USA has a number
of options for getting the information off your computer screen and printing
it to paper or saving it to a file.
To print or save maps and directions, click the Print tab. You see two buttons:
 Click the Map button for options to print or save the current map.
 Click the Route button for print and save options of the current route.
Figure 12-5:
Create a

information.
203
Chapter 12: On the Road with DeLorme Street Atlas USA

Saving and printing maps
All the Print and Save command buttons are next to the Overview Map on the
far right of the Print tab area. You have buttons for
 Printing the current map
 E-mailing the print area as an attachment
 Saving the print area to disk as a graphics file
 Copying the print area to the Clipboard
If you select the Print Preview check box, the map is reduced in scale, and a
rectangle is displayed around the print area.
Saving and printing routes
You can also save and print route information in a number of different formats,
including an overview map with directions, turn-by-turn details, and as strip
maps (detailed maps that follow a route with directions in the margins). Check
the type of directions you’d like to create, using the Save and Print command
buttons at the far end of the Tab area to output them. Figure 12-7 shows a
preview of a Travel Package, which is a format that prints the route map with
directions at the bottom of the page.
Figure 12-6:

204
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

If you want only a text version of the route directions, click the Route button
in the Print tab and then mark the Directions check box. You can then either
save the directions as a text file or e-mail them to a friend.
If you end up in Chinatown, the entrance to Sam Wo’s restaurant is through
the street-level kitchen, so don’t think you’re in the wrong place. Head up the
narrow stairs to the second floor and don’t disturb the cooks on your way
up. Bon appétit!
Moving Maps with Earthmate
In addition to its mapping software, DeLorme also offers the small Earthmate
GPS receiver that’s designed to work with Street Atlas USA and other map
programs that use GPS data. (You can use other types of GPS receivers with
Street Atlas USA, too, but the Earthmate is designed to work with the program
with a minimal amount of setup.)
You can connect the Earthmate to a laptop via a Universal Serial Bus (USB)
cable, serial cable, or a PowerPack that supports Bluetooth wireless 
Figure 12-7:

Chapter 12: On the Road with DeLorme Street Atlas USA

communications. After you have the GPS receiver hooked up and Street Atlas
is running, the two general modes of operation are
 General navigation: Street Atlas USA processes the received GPS data
and displays your current position on the map with a series of dots that
shows where you’ve traveled. As you move, the map automatically moves
to show your position. In addition, your speed, direction of travel, and
GPS satellite information is shown in the program’s GPS tab, as seen in
Figure 12-8.
 Route: After you create a route (see the earlier section, “Creating a
route,”) in addition to the general navigation features, Street Atlas USA
displays turn-by-turn directions onscreen, informing you how far your
destination is and the travel time to your destination. If you have the
voice feature enabled, Street Atlas USA announces the directions; you
can choose from several different types of voices.
206
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 
GPS car navigation systems
Street navigation software coupled with a laptop
and GPS receiver isn’t your only option to stay
found while driving through the asphalt jungle.
GPS car navigation systems are starting to
become popular as factory-installed options and
third-party add-ons for cars and trucks. These
systems are streamlined versions of street navi-
gation programs, offering basic navigation fea-
tures such as real-time map display, address
searches, and route planning.
Car navigation systems range from portable,
handheld GPS receivers that are equally at home
on the trail or the road to systems permanently
installed in a vehicle. Some of the more sophis-
ticated products use gyroscopes, connections
to the Vehicle Speed Sensor (car-speak for a
speedometer), and three-axis accelerometers
to provide speed and distance information
when a GPS signal is temporarily lost; such as in
tunnels or urban areas with tall buildings.
I have to admit I’m not a true road warrior and
don’t spend lots of time in my car. However, I did
have a chance to try out a Magellan RoadMate
GPS navigation system (www.magellangps.
com) for a while and was pretty impressed.
RoadMate mounts on your dashboard (as shown
here) and is portable so you can easily transfer
it from one car to another. The version I tested
had an internal hard drive that was preloaded
with street maps of the entire U.S., so you can just
plug it into your cigarette lighter and go. This is
perfect for a business traveler who just flew into
a city he’s never been to before and has to spend
the next couple of days in a rental car trying to
find his way around. Routes are calculated in a
matter of seconds, and a large, high-resolution
map screen keeps your progress updated. And
with a touch screen, voice prompts, and a simple
user interface, even my nontechnical friends
and family members were able to figure out how
to use it in no time.
Granted, the RoadMate is a single purpose
device, costs about as much as a low-end laptop,
and doesn’t have all the features of a street nav-
igation software package. However, if I were
regularly spending a lot of time on the road or
visiting cities I didn’t know very well, I’d give some
serious consideration to it or a similar GPS nav-
igation system. My crystal ball tells me it won’t
be too many years into the future when in-car
navigation systems start to become standard in
most new cars and trucks.

If you’re driving by yourself, be careful when using the GPS features of Street
Atlas USA with your laptop sitting next to you on the passenger seat. Fight
the tendency to get distracted from your driving while you look at the screen
and use the mouse and keyboard to enter commands. I recommend someone
riding shotgun — that is, a navigator who’s in charge of running Street Atlas
USA. If you drive solo a lot, get a laptop-mounting bracket that places your
computer in a more visible and easy-to-use location.
Other Street Navigation Software
In addition to Street Atlas USA, here are two other popular street navigation
programs available for navigating the roads of America. I don’t have enough
space to fully describe them, but here’s some general information in case
you’re shopping for software.
New versions of street navigation software are usually released annually with
new street and POI data as well as new features. If you travel in an area that
doesn’t experience much growth or change, you probably don’t need to
upgrade every year. On the other hand, because all the street navigation soft-
ware packages retail for under $50, it’s not that expensive to stay current.

Microsoft Streets & Trips
Microsoft’s Streets & Trips is a popular alternative to DeLorme’s software. The
program has all the basic street navigation features, including some advanced
features such as saving a map as a Web page, downloading current road con-
struction information from the Internet, and creating drive time zones (such
as show me all the places I can drive to from a certain location in under an hour).
The software is easy to use and comes bundled with Pocket Streets, the Pocket
PC version of Streets & Trips. See Figure 12-9 for a screenshot of the user inter-
face. To discover more about Streets & Trips, go to www.microsoft.com/
streets.
Rand McNally StreetFinder & 
TripMaker Deluxe
Rand McNally, in the map business for over 130 years, is one of the main
providers of U.S. paper street maps and road atlases. The StreetFinder &
TripMaker Deluxe software package provides all the features you’d expect 
in a street navigation program, along with Mobile Travel Guide ratings for
hotels and restaurants and suggested scenic tours and one-day driving trips.

f you spend a lot of time off the beaten path in the mountains, hills, deserts,
and plains, you should consider using topographic mapping software. These
programs come bundled with United States Geological Survey (USGS) digital
maps and are a perfect companion for any outdoor enthusiast. Before you head
off into the wilds, you can print a topographic map of an area you’re interested
in visiting and even plan your trip on your PC. If you have a GPS receiver, you
can interface it with the map program to see exactly where you’ve been or
upload waypoint and route information entered on the electronic map to your
GPS receiver.
Commercial topographic software packages are easy to use, convenient (you
don’t need to find and download maps to use them), and economical. Most of
the map products on the market cost under $100 and give you 1:24,000 scale
map coverage of a state or region; for the same price, other software provides
less-detailed 1:100,000 scale maps of the entire U.S. This is a bargain consider-
ing that a paper version of a USGS topographic map costs around $7, and you
might have to buy up to a thousand maps to fully cover a single state.
In this chapter, I discuss commercial software packages that offer topographic
maps of the U.S. I focus primarily on Maptech’s Terrain Navigator to illustrate
these programs. Although they sport different user interfaces, most commer-
cial topographic map programs share the same basic capabilities and features.
At the end of this chapter, I briefly review some other popular topographic
map programs.

Discovering Terrain Navigator
Maptech’s Terrain Navigator (www.maptech.com) was one of the first commer-
cial, Windows topographic map programs. (In the old days it was known as
TopoScout.) Over the years, Terrain Navigator has evolved into a sophisticated,
powerful, electronic mapping tool.
You can purchase different versions of Terrain Navigator. The program that
accesses map data is the same, but the maps that come bundled on CD-ROMs
are different. Different versions of Terrain Navigator provide topographic
maps for individual states and different regions of the U.S. (in this chapter I
use Oregon state maps). The majority of commercial map programs are also
sold this way. Plan on spending around a hundred dollars for a complete set
of Terrain Navigator digital maps for a single state.
You use Terrain Navigator’s main features — which most other topographic
map products share — to help you
 Quickly find locations by name or coordinates.
 Accurately measure distance and area.
 Display terrain three-dimensionally.
 Show elevation profiles of routes of travel.
 Customize maps with labels, markers, and routes.
 Interface maps with GPS receivers to upload and download waypoints,
routes, and tracks or use for real-time tracking.
Read on to take a look at some of Terrain Navigator’s basic features and see
how to use them. Whether you put on your boots and backpack is completely
up to you.
Maptech has a free demo version of Terrain Navigator that comes with a
single map of a wilderness area in Colorado. You can download the demo at
www.mpatech.com/support/downloads.cfm. Be sure to read through the
online help and tutorial because it describes a number of program features
that I don’t have space to cover in this chapter.
Displaying Maps and Finding Places
When Terrain Navigator starts up, a map of the state or region that you’ve
installed on your PC is displayed. Figure 13-1 shows a state map: in this case,
the state of Oregon. Here are the basic rules of engagement:
210
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

 If you know the general area you’d like to view, click there on the map. A
grid appears in the vicinity of where you click. Each of the rectangles in
the grid represents a 1:24,000 USGS topographic map.
 Moving the cursor over the grid displays the map name at the top of the
window that’s associated with a rectangle.
 Double-click a rectangle to display a map.
 If you know the USGS map name, you can select it from the Map Name
drop-down list, which displays all the map names associated with the
currently selected grid.
If you click different parts of the state map, you’ll notice that grids appear and
disappear. When a grid is displayed, it shows all the maps that are on one of
the CDs that came with Terrain Navigator; the name of the CD appears in the
window title. This helps you know which disc you need to insert into your
CD-ROM drive to display maps for different areas.
Double-clicking a grid rectangle is one way to display a map, but here are
quicker and more precise ways to view a specific location. You can display 
a map by searching for
 City or town name
 ZIP code
 Coordinates

Chapter 13: On the Ground with Maptech Terrain Navigator

 Place names
 Features you’ve previously marked on the map
Suppose you vaguely remember hearing about a real cool hike to the top of a
mountain that has an amazing view. You know it’s somewhere around Waldo
Lake, Oregon, but the name of the mountain just isn’t coming to mind. You
think it might have something to do with apples: Gala, Granny Smith, Braeburn,
maybe Fuji. Even with fuzzy information like this, Terrain Navigator can help
you zero in on the location. Here’s how:
1. Under the state map, click the Find button.
A pop-up menu appears.
2. Choose the Search All Place Names menu item.
The Search All Place Names dialog box opens.
3. In the Keyword text box, enter the place name you want to search for.
In this example, enter Fuji.
4. Click the Find button.
A list of places that match your search text is displayed, as shown in
Figure 13-2. Ah, ha! There’s Fuji Mountain. That rings a bell.
Figure 13-2:

212
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

5. Double-click the place name that you want to view.
For this example, double-click Fuji Mountain.
The map that corresponds to the place name is displayed with the loca-
tion circled — in this case, exactly the place you were looking for, Fuji
Mountain, a couple of miles southwest of Waldo Lake.
After the search map is displayed, you can search for other place names or
coordinates by clicking the Find Place button (with the binoculars icon) on
the toolbar.
Navigating a Terrain Navigator Map
After you have a map displayed, as shown in Figure 13-3, you can do a lot
more than just look at it onscreen and print it out. One of biggest advantages
to a digital map is you can interact with the map more than if it were a paper
map. Stick with me here to find out how to move around in a map and change
its size.

Chapter 13: On the Ground with Maptech Terrain Navigator

Moving around in a map
More than likely, you’ll want to move around the map and check out the
countryside that currently isn’t being displayed onscreen. Here’s how:
 Move the cursor to one of the edges of the map. The cursor turns into
an arrow; click to scroll the map in the direction that the arrow points.
 Click the Drag tool on the toolbar. (It’s shaped like a hand.) Move the
cursor to the map and hold down the left mouse button; then scroll the
map by dragging.
 Click the Center tool on the toolbar. (It’s shaped like a bull’s-eye with
crosshairs.) With this tool selected, wherever you click the map, the
map is drawn so it’s centered at that location.
 Move the rectangle in the overview map. A small overview map appears
to the left of the main map. A blue rectangle shows what part of the map
is currently displayed onscreen. You can drag the overview map rectangle
to show a new location onscreen.
As you move the cursor around the map, the coordinates and the elevation
under the cursor location are displayed in the toolbar. This is useful for deter-
mining the exact locations of features on the map.
Changing the map size
Terrain Navigator offers two ways for you to change the size of a map and
show more detail or area.
214
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 
Shifty tips
Don’t overlook the keyboard and mouse short-
cuts in Terrain Navigator that can speed things
up as you move around the map. They include
 Shift+click: Zooms out and centers the map
at the location you clicked — unless the
zoom-out (magnifying glass icon with a minus
sign) tool is selected, in which case you’ll
zoom in.
 Shift+Ctrl+click: Centers the map wherever
you click.
 Ctrl: Changes the cursor to the Drag tool and
allows you to scroll the map.
 Right-click: Displays a pop-up menu with
zoom and other options.

 Zooming: The toolbar has two icons bearing a magnifying glass: one
with a plus sign and the other with a minus sign. When the plus sign
magnifying glass is selected, you zoom in when you click the map. When
the minus sign magnifying glass is selected, clicking zooms you out.
 Changing the scale: Maps can be displayed in either 1:24,000 (more detail,
smaller area) or 1:100,000 scale (less detail, larger area). Note the map
scale command in the toolbar that displays a menu for selecting the scale
of your choice.
Planning a Trip with Terrain Navigator
If you’ve followed this chapter to this point, you’ve located a map of Fuji
Mountain. Keep your imagination flowing and plan a hiking trip there. Suppose
that your friends gave you some vague directions about taking a series of log-
ging roads to get to the trailhead. The trail wasn’t very well marked, but when
they found it, it climbed steeply for a couple of miles to the summit. However,
the last time you listened to your friends, the short pleasant hike that they
described turned into an eight-hour death march through thick underbrush
and straight up a rock face. This time, you decide to use Terrain Navigator to
get a better picture of this little outing.
1. Look on the map for a trail.
You want the one that goes to the summit of Fuji Mountain. (Only one
trail goes to the top.) As you follow it down, you see that it intersects
with an unimproved road — probably the logging road your friends told
you about.
The symbol for a trail on USGS maps is a single dashed line. Lines with
two sets of dashes indicate an unimproved road.
2. Click the Marker tool on the toolbar, move the cursor to where the
road intersects the trail, and click to create a waypoint for the trail-
head (the beginning of the trail).
The Marker tool looks like a pyramid.
This creates a GPS waypoint at that location named Mrk1. Click the name
and rename it Fuji Trailhead.
3. Use the Marker tool to create another GPS waypoint at the end of the
trail.
This marks a waypoint at the summit of Fuji Mountain. Rename this one
Fuji Mountain (see how in Step 2).
215
Chapter 13: On the Ground with Maptech Terrain Navigator

With these two GPS waypoints set, you now know where the trail starts
and ends. If you’re using a GPS receiver, the first waypoint will help you
find the trailhead, and the second waypoint will help you reach your final
destination. You can manually enter the waypoints in your GPS receiver
or have Terrain Navigator upload them for you.
Be sure that the map datum matches the datum your GPS receiver is
using (head over to Chapter 4 for information about what happens when
datums don’t match). You can set the map datum in Terrain Navigator
by choosing File➪Preferences➪General.
4. Click the Track tool on the toolbar to draw your planned course of
travel on the map.
The Track tool, which looks like a pencil, works by drawing a line from the
last place you clicked. However, it doesn’t allow you to freehand draw
like with a real pencil.
5. Follow the trail by clicking the mouse (like playing connect-the-dots).
Trace the trail that heads up Fuji Mountain, starting at the road intersec-
tion. After you click, the current length (in feet or miles) of the track is
displayed in the status bar below the map.
6. When you’re finished, right-click and choose Finish Track from the
pop-up menu.
7. Edit the track, giving it a name and changing its color if you like.
Move the cursor on the track that you just created, right-click, and choose
Edit from the pop-up menu. You can now name the track (use Fuji) and
change its color if you like.
The finished map with the waypoints and the track is shown in Figure
13-4. You can upload the waypoints and track data to your GPS receiver
before you leave on the hike to help with your navigation.
Use Terrain Navigator to turn a track into a route. A route is a course of travel
that’s broken up into a series of waypoints that define segments of your trip.
You navigate between the route waypoints to reach your final destination.
Typically the number of track points is reduced when you convert a track to
a route. Thus, there’s not as much detail, and you end up with straight lines
instead of curves. If you want to upload a course of travel to your GPS receiver,
it’s more efficient to use a route than a track. To convert a route, right-click a
track and choose Create Route from the pop-up menu.
Even if you don’t have a GPS receiver to which you can upload waypoint,
route, or track data, you can use Terrain Navigator to find a trail, print a map
of that trail to take with you, and determine the distance of your hike. Just
remember to bring your compass!
216
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

You can upload data from topographic map programs to your GPS receiver 
or download waypoints, routes, and tracks from your GPS receiver to the
map program. For example, you could overlay a track you recorded with your
GPS receiver on the electronic map to see where you had been. Check the map
program documentation or online help to find out how to interface your GPS
receiver. Chapter 9 has a number of hints and tips for connecting GPS receivers
to PCs.
Understanding Terrain Elevation
Unless you’ve had some experience reading topographic maps, trying to figure
out terrain elevation based on contour lines can be challenging. (Contour
lines are a way of representing height on a map.) Terrain Navigator has two
features — 3-D View and the Terrain Profile tool — that help you better visu-
alize where the land starts to get steep or flatten. You can use the map from
earlier sections of this chapter to see just how much of a climb you’re in for.

Using a 3-D map image
Use Terrain Navigator to display 3-D, shaded relief images of a map to help
you better understand the terrain. To show a 3-D image of the map that’s cur-
rently displayed onscreen, click the 3-D View button on the toolbar. (It looks
like mountains with a small bar underneath.)
The topographic map of Fuji Mountain (including the markers and track added
in the earlier section, “Planning a Trip with Terrain Navigator”) is displayed
in 3-D, as shown in Figure 13-5.
A red rectangle appears on the overview map, showing you the general loca-
tion of the terrain, based on the current 3-D view of the map.

Other Maptech products
In addition to Terrain Navigator, Maptech has
several other topographic map products that
you might find useful, including
 Terrain Navigator Pro is Maptech’s high-end
version of Terrain Navigator targeted toward
professional map users and is priced around
$300 per state. Use its enhanced features to
 Display aerial photographs downloaded from
the Maptech’s Internet servers.
 Locate street addresses.
 Link digital photos, spreadsheets, and other
files with locations on maps.
 Export maps for use with Geographic
Information System (GIS) programs such as
ArcGIS and AutoCAD.
 National Park Digital Guide has topo-
graphic maps of all the National Parks in the
United States, including photos and infor-
mation about sights and services both
inside and outside the parks. The guide
costs around $50.
 Appalachian, Continental Divide, and
Pacific Crest Trail products contain topo-
graphic maps for the areas around each one
of these classic trails and cost under $100.
The Appalachian Trail software, priced
around $50, has extensive guidebook infor-
mation along with maps.
 Outdoor Navigator is a mapping program
for Pocket PCs and Palm PDAs that lets you
load detailed topographic maps on your
PDA. The product is priced around $100.
You can find more about these products 
and their features by visiting: www.map
tech.com

 Click and drag the cursor on the map to rotate the image.
 Use the trackball control to the left of the map to rotate up, down, left,
and right. You can also use the keyboard navigation arrow keys.
 Use the Elevation slider bar control (it has a picture of a truck, a heli-
copter, and an airplane) to adjust the height you’re viewing the map
from.
 Use the zoom arrows above the Elevation slider bar to control how close
forward or backward your view of the terrain is.
 Use the Vertical Exaggeration buttons beneath the trackball control to
increase and decrease the vertical scale so elevation differences are
easy to distinguish.
To toggle back to a 2-D version of the map, click the 3-D View toolbar button.
If you want a true 3-D experience, Terrain Navigator comes with a special pair
of red-and-blue-lens, stereoscopic glasses. If you click the 3-D Glasses icon,
the map is colored so it appears to have three-dimensional depth when you’re
wearing the glasses.

219
Chapter 13: On the Ground with Maptech Terrain Navigator

Charting elevation profiles
Although the 3-D map view gives you a visual sense of how steep your hike is,
you can get even more detailed information by using the Terrain Profile tool.
This feature shows you the elevation gain/loss of your hike in pictures and
numbers. Here’s how to use this tool:
1. Make sure that the map is displayed in 2-D.
See the preceding section for how to do this.
2. Click the Information tool on the toolbar (an arrow with a question
mark).
3. Right-click the track and select Profile from the pop-up menu.
A Profile dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 13-6, that displays an ele-
vation chart of the trail as well as how many feet you’ll be climbing and
descending over the course of the trip.
Figure 13-6:
Show

mation for 
a selected

220
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Vertical profiles may have a lot of vertical exaggeration to show relative
steepness. This can make terrain appear steeper than it actually is.
Reviewing Other Topographic 
Map Software
In addition to Maptech and its topographic mapping programs, DeLorme and
National Geographic also offer software that’s suited for off-road use. As pre-
viously mentioned, most topographic map programs have the same basic 
features; the biggest difference is their user interface. Because I don’t have
the time to cover the other mapping programs in detail, this section provides
a brief description of a few popular programs, shows some screenshots to
give you an idea of what the user interface is like, and provides manufacturer
Web sites to get more product information. When it comes to choosing a topo-
graphic map program, you really can’t go wrong with any of the programs
mentioned in this chapter.
You can’t upload detailed maps to your GPS receiver from any of the programs
discussed in this chapter. GPS receivers that display maps can use only propri-
etary maps (sold by the GPS manufacturer), and these tend to show consider-
ably less detail than maps you can display on your PC. Several topographic
map software companies do offer products that you can use with a Pocket
PC/Palm PDA and GPS receivers that can display detailed topographic maps
just as they appear on a PC screen.
DeLorme mapping products
DeLorme, well known for its Street Atlas USA road navigation software, also
makes two topographic mapping programs: Topo USA and 3-D TopoQuads.
DeLorme uses the same user interface for its entire line of consumer mapping
products, so if you’re a happy user of Street Atlas USA and are looking for a map
program for off-road use, it makes sense to keep things in the DeLorme family.
DeLorme was one of the first vendors to offer customers a choice of map data
on CDs or DVDs. If you have a DVD player on your PC, DVDs are far more con-
venient because you don’t have as many discs to keep track of, and you don’t
have to swap discs as often to view maps of different areas.
221
Chapter 13: On the Ground with Maptech Terrain Navigator

DeLorme topographic mapping products can interface with GPS receivers,
display 3-D maps, search for locations, provide elevation profiles, and plan
for trips just like other map programs. These two unique features in the pro-
gram are especially useful:
 Satellite imagery: DeLorme sells 10-meter resolution color satellite data
for each state. When you use the images with DeLorme mapping products,
you can view the satellite photos side by side with topographic maps in
2-D or 3-D. (See an example produced by Topo USA in Figure 13-7.)
 Mural printing: If you need to produce a large map for a presentation,
the programs support printing mural maps that are up to three pages
high by three pages wide that you can join to make a large map.
To read more about DeLorme’s mapping programs, visit www.delorme.com.
Topo USA
Topo USA provides 1:100,000 scale topographic maps of the entire United
States (for around the same price as a collection of 1:24,000 scale digital
maps for a single state). Remember, you don’t get as much detail as you
would with a 1:24,000 scale map, but there’s enough detail for rudimentary
navigation and to use as a general reference.
Figure 13-7:

222
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

The Topo USA maps are vector-based (drawn with lines and shapes), so 
they don’t have the crisp appearance of a USGS digital raster map. However,
DeLorme vector maps tend to have more updated road information because
some of the scanned raster maps are based on data from maps made over 20
years ago.
3-D TopoQuads
3-D TopoQuads provides more detailed maps that are sold by state or region.
The maps are displayed as vector maps until you zoom in far enough, and
then they become 1:24,000 scale USGS scanned digital raster maps. (See an
example of a map, including 2-D and 3-D views, in Figure 13-8.)
National Geographic mapping products
Many children got their first introduction to maps from National Geographic
magazines. Each month, a carefully folded paper map of somewhere foreign
and exotic came nestled inside the magazine. National Geographic is still in
the map business, now producing several topographic map programs.

223
Chapter 13: On the Ground with Maptech Terrain Navigator

I was one of those kids that got hooked on National Geographic maps when I
was growing up, and I still like them today. The company’s map software is
easy to use and strikes a nice balance of having just the right number and
types of features, without having too many whistles and bells.
National Geographic software has all the same basic features as other map-
ping programs, such as GPS support, route planning, printing maps, and
searching for locations. The only exception is that National Geographic 
programs currently use only relief shading to show elevation and don’t
render 3-D map images.
National Geographic has a number of paper and electronic map products
available; visit www.nationalgeographic.com/maps. The two digital map
products that you’ll find the most practical for backcountry use are Back
Roads Explorer and TOPO!
Back Roads Explorer
Back Roads Explorer contains 1:100,000 scale topographic maps and larger
overview maps of the entire United States. In addition to terrain data, the
software also has road and street data that you can overlay on top of a map,
including paved and unpaved roads. (An example is shown in Figure 13-9.)
Figure 13-9:
Back Roads
Explorer

with over-
laid roads.
224
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Unlike DeLorme’s Topo USA, Back Roads Explorer uses raster maps (scanned
versions of paper maps), which contain more detail. If you prefer more of a
traditional looking map to one that looks like it was computer-generated,
you’ll like Back Roads Explorer.
Raster maps take up more disk space than vector maps because they’re
scanned images of paper maps. Vector maps are smaller because they’re com-
posed of lines and shapes. For example, the raster map data for the entire
United States that comes with Back Roads Explorer fits on 17 CDs, but the
same vector data in Topo USA comes on 6 CDs.
With the option of overlaying up-to-date roads over topographic maps, Back
Roads Explorer is ideal for basic navigation and is especially well suited for 
4 x 4 enthusiasts who use a laptop and GPS receiver.
TOPO!
National Geographic’s TOPO! line of software provides 1:24,000 maps for 
each of the states and is comparable with Maptech’s Terrain Navigator and
DeLorme’s 3-D TopoQuads products. (A screenshot of a TOPO! 1:24,000 scale
map is shown in Figure 13-10.)
Figure 13-10:

225
Chapter 13: On the Ground with Maptech Terrain Navigator

One feature that I especially like in the TOPO! products is mapXchange. You
can visit the National Geographic Web site and select the state you have
TOPO! maps for. A list of hikes and other outdoor activities is displayed with
descriptions, and you can freely download files that contain waypoints and
routes you can use with TOPO! If you like, you can also upload your own files
of places you’ve been to share with other outdoor enthusiasts.

A
erial photos complement other types of maps because they give you a
snapshot of reality. Programs that display aerials (map-speak shorthand
for aerial photos) are both inexpensive and easy to use. In this chapter, I review
mapping programs that can exploit aerial photos, primarily focusing on the
popular shareware application, USAPhotoMaps.
To better illustrate the capabilities and functions of this program, I walk you
through downloading an aerial photo, scrolling and zooming, interfacing the
program with a GPS receiver, and saving map data.
To get the most from this chapter, download and install USAPhotoMaps
(http://jdmcox.com) and then use the program to work through the exam-
ples in the following pages. Unlike some shareware programs, USAPhotoMaps
isn’t crippled; that is, all its features work when you download the program. If
you find the program useful, you can make a donation to the author’s PayPal
account.
Enhancing TerraServer-USA 
with USAPhotoMaps
TerraServer-USA is a popular Web site that displays free aerial photographs
and topographic maps of the U.S. that are produced by the United States
Geological Survey (USGS). (Read more about TerraServer-USA in Chapter 20.)
And although TerraServer-USA is a great Web-hosted mapping service, it has
several limitations:

 Only a relatively small geographic area can be displayed.
 You can’t edit downloaded photos and maps.
 GPS receiver data can’t be used with the photos and maps.
You can read more about TerraServer-USA in the sidebar, “TerraServer-USA
limitations.”
To address these issues, several developers have created programs that down-
load TerraServer-USA aerial photos and maps so you can put the data to more
versatile use. Instead of relying on a Web browser, you use these standalone
programs — like USAPhotoMaps — to create scrollable, aerial photos of just
about anywhere in the United States that can be customized and saved and
optionally overlaid with GPS data.
Discovering USAPhotoMaps Features
USAPhotoMaps is an aerial photo and map program written by Doug Cox, who
is a retired airline pilot turned Windows programmer. USAPhotoMaps is ele-
gantly small and simple to use, with a number of powerful features. Use it to
 Display USGS aerial photographs and topographic maps.
 Zoom in and out on map features.
 Support user-defined text labels.
 Save user-selected areas as JPG format files.
 Interface with a GPS receiver for real-time tracking.
 Import and export GPS waypoints, routes, and tracks.
USAPhotoMaps has an extensive online help file.

The first time you run USAPhotoMaps, a dialog box appears that prompts
you to create a new map. You need to enter the following:
 What you want to name the map.
 The coordinates of the area you’re interested in viewing. The coordi-
nates can be in either
• Latitude and longitude
• Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
228
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Read more about UTM, latitude, and longitude in Chapter 2. If you don’t know
the latitude and longitude coordinates of the location you’re interested in
seeing, quickly skip over to Chapter 11 to read how to find coordinates of
place names.
As an example, create an aerial photomap of Seattle, Washington.
1. Enter the name, latitude, and longitude in the New Map dialog box.
(See Figure 14-1.)
• Name: Seattle
• Latitude: 47.61431
• Longitude: 122.32898
2. Click OK.
A series of gray squares appear onscreen.
3. Download aerial photos from TerraServer-USA for the area that you
specified (with the latitude and longitude coordinates). Make sure that
you’re connected to the Internet and then press the F key.
A mosaic of aerial photograph images replaces the gray squares as the
screen is filled with data from TerraServer-USA. The final result is shown
in Figure 14-2.
If you’re using a firewall, your computer might complain when USAPhotoMaps
tries to connect to TerraServer-USA. Because the program is just downloading
map data, you can give permission for USAPhotoMaps to access the Internet.

Chapter 14: From the Air with USAPhotoMaps
TerraServer-USA limitations
The first time you see USAPhotoMaps display
TerraServer-USA aerial photos, you’re probably
going to say, “Wow! This is like having my own
personal spy satellite.” Well, sort of, but there
are a few catches:
 Yanks only: TerraServer-USA provides aerial
photos and maps of United States locations
only. And although the aerial photo database
is fairly complete, some areas in the U.S.
don’t have photo data.
 Not always current: TerraServer-USA aerial
photographs tend to be not very current. In
fact, they can be up to ten years old because
the USGS produces new sets of aerial photos
only as often as needs and budgets allow.
 No color: Only black-and-white photos are
currently available. TerraServer-USA does
plan to carry more recent, high-resolution,
color aerial photographs that the USGS has
produced for selected urban areas, but it will
be many years until color aerial photographs
are available of most of the United States.
 Data transfer hiccups: Network outages and
server upgrades can disrupt TerraServer-
USA data transfers.

Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

If you plan to use USAPhotoMaps to build an extensive aerial photo collec-
tion, a high-speed Internet connection will make your life much easier. Each
individual aerial photo or topographic map image in the displayed mosaic is
roughly 50–200K in size. (The actual size depends on how much unique ter-
rain is shown in the image.) At 2 meters-per-pixel resolution, it takes 70 images
to fill the screen of a 1024 x 768 monitor; that’s anywhere from 7–17MB of data
to download.
Getting the Most from Aerial Photos
After you have an aerial photo displayed, navigate inside the image. (Read
the preceding section for how to download and display an aerial photo.)
USAPhotoMaps has a number of different commands to view and manipulate
the photo.
The datum used for all TerraServer-USA maps is NAD 83. This is nearly identi-
cal to the WGS 84 datum used as a default by GPS receivers. If you plan on
using your GPS receiver with USAPhotoMaps, be sure that the datum settings
match. (Read more about datums in Chapter 2.)
The first thing you’ll notice is that when you move the mouse cursor around
the screen, map coordinates appear in the window title bar. This feature allows
you to move the cursor over a feature that’s shown on the aerial photo and
get its precise coordinates.
You can change how you want the coordinates displayed from the View menu.
Choose the Lat/Lon item and then specify whether you want the coordinates
shown in decimal degrees, degrees and decimal minutes, degrees/minutes/
seconds, or UTM formats.
Press the X key to display a dialog box with the coordinates that the cursor is
currently over. You can copy the coordinates from this dialog box and paste
them into another program.
Switching between aerial photos 
and topographic maps
After you know where you are in a photo (see the preceding section), look 
at the commands that you can use to move around. As I mention earlier,
TerraServer-USA provides both aerial photos and USGS topographic maps,
231
Chapter 14: From the Air with USAPhotoMaps

and USAPhotoMaps lets you switch between the two types of images. (Figure
14-3 shows a topographic map.) This is useful because you can look at a topo-
graphic map and then immediately see what the same location looks like as
an aerial photo. This is a big advantage because aerial photos often show
more feature detail than topographic maps.
Here are the two ways (in USAPhotoMaps) to display a topographic map ver-
sion of an aerial photo you’re viewing:
 From the View menu, choose Map Type➪Topo.
 Press the T key.
If gray squares appear onscreen, you haven’t downloaded map data for that
area yet. To download the map, press the F key.
To switch back to an aerial photo view of the location
 From the View menu, choose Map Type➪Photo.
 Press the P key.
Figure 14-3:

232
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Moving around the map
You’ve probably noticed that USAPhotoMaps doesn’t use scroll bars like other
Windows programs. Not to worry; you can still move around in a photo or
map by using the keyboard navigational arrow keys:
If you see gray squares while you’re scrolling, map data has yet to be down-
loaded for that particular area. Figure 14-4 shows gray squares with aerial
photo data that hasn’t been downloaded. Here are two ways to fill the squares
with map or photo data:
 From the File menu, choose Download Map Data➪Fill Screen.
 Press the F key.
USAPhotoMaps connects to TerraServer-USA and downloads the map data
for that area.
Instead of scrolling, you can also go directly to a location that you know the
coordinates of. Just choose the Go To Lat/Lon item in the View menu and
enter the coordinates.
Figure 14-4:
The gray
squares

loaded.
233
Chapter 14: From the Air with USAPhotoMaps

USAPhotoMaps has two display modes: aerial photo and topographic map.
When you download data to fill in the gray squares, only data for the particu-
lar mode that you’re in is downloaded. For example, if you’re viewing an aerial
photo, only new aerial photo data is downloaded.
Zooming in and out
You can zoom in and out on an aerial photo or map to see more detail or get
a larger, big picture view. For zooming, use these keys:
 Zoom in: Press Page Down or the plus (+) key.
 Zoom out: Press Page Up or the minus/dash (–) key.
The current zoom level appears in the window title bar, so you always know
how far you’ve zoomed in or out.
The zoom level on the window title bar displays the resolution of the image. If
the resolution is 4 meters-per-pixel, each pixel (picture element) onscreen rep-
resents an object 4 meters in size. (Remember that a meter is roughly a yard.)
Smaller numbers mean higher resolution and greater detail. For example, 1
meter-per-pixel resolution means that you can distinguish objects on the ground
that are one meter in size. Figure 14-5 shows a 2 meter-per-pixel aerial photo.
How far you can zoom in and out on an image depends on what type of map
you’re viewing.
 Topographic maps: 4, 8, 16, or 32 meters-per-pixel
 Aerial photos: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 meters-per-pixel
If you’re switching back and forth between aerial photos and topographic
maps, use either a 4 or an 8 meters-per-pixel zoom level. This will give you
close to a one-to-one size representation of features on the aerial photo and
the topographic map.
Enhancing contrast
One of the things you’ll notice as you start to view aerial photos is that the
contrast might be lighter or darker with certain images. This has to do with
the amount of sunlight when the photo was taken and the background color
of the terrain.
234
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

To enhance less-than-optimal contrast, USAPhotoMaps has a nifty feature
that lets you adjust the contrast of the photos displayed onscreen by either
lightening or darkening them. This can really enhance detail in a photo.
You can control the contrast of a photo by using these keys:
 Lighten: Press the B key.
 Darken: Press the D key.
You can also set contrast by selecting Brightness from the View menu, includ-
ing restoring the contrast back to its default setting.
Entering text
After you have an aerial photo displayed, you can add text labels to different
features when the image is displayed at the 1- or 2-meter zoom levels. To enter
a text label

Chapter 14: From the Air with USAPhotoMaps

1. Move the mouse cursor to the location where you want the text to start.
2. Hold down the Shift key.
3. Move the cursor in the direction you want the text to be aligned.
A line is temporarily drawn as you move the cursor. For example, if you
draw a line at a 45-degree angle, the text will flow at a 45-degree angle.
4. Release the Shift key.
5. In the dialog box that appears, type in the text label and click OK.
A list of all the text labels is displayed.
Text in a label is limited to 60 characters and can be edited or deleted by
choosing Text➪List.
You can set the text color by choosing File➪Preferences➪Colors. The Color
Preference dialog box, which isn’t all that intuitive, uses a series of radio but-
tons that correspond to red, green, and blue values. Your best bet for choosing
a color you’d like is to enter some text and then display the Color Preference
dialog box. When you select different combinations of color radio buttons, the
text you entered changes color.
Creating and Using Multiple Map Files
USAPhotoMaps uses a map file to name areas that have downloaded aerial
photo or map data. A map file is a bookmark for a general vicinity or location.
For example, you might have downloaded aerial photos for the entire Grand
Canyon. Instead of scrolling to view photos at each end, you could create two
map files, one called North Grand Canyon and the other South Grand Canyon.
To create a map file bookmark
1. From the File menu, choose New Map File.
2. In the New Map dialog box that appears, enter the name of the map
file and the coordinates that you’d like to bookmark.
Refer to Figure 14-1.
3. Click OK.
After you create a map file, select it, and USAPhotoMaps displays the aerial
photo or map associated with that area.
To select and display a new map file
236
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

1. From the File menu, choose Open Map File.
2. Select the name of the map file to load.
3. Click OK.
The area that you bookmarked is now displayed onscreen.
Map file bookmarks are used to identify a general location. They shouldn’t be
used for marking a very specific set of coordinates, such as a GPS waypoint.
Saving Aerial Photos
After you have an aerial photo or map displayed onscreen, you can save the
image to use with other programs:
 From the File menu: Choose Copy to Screen.jpg. This saves a copy of
the aerial photo or map currently displayed onscreen to a file named
Screen.jpg in the same folder that USAPhotoMaps is installed in.
 Print Screen: Press the Print Screen key to save the current image to the
Clipboard. If you want to save only a portion of the map or aerial photo
that appears onscreen, read Chapter 17 for practical tips on saving and
editing images.
 BigJpeg: Use the BigJpeg utility. Doug Cox has a free utility that creates a
single, 1-meter resolution, JPG format graphics file from a photo or map.
You define the boundaries of an area you want to save in USAPhotoMaps
and then run BigJpeg to create the graphics file. You can download
BigJpeg, with complete instructions, at http://jdmcox.com.
237
Chapter 14: From the Air with USAPhotoMaps
Saving strategies
After an aerial photo or map is displayed on-
screen, that data now resides on your hard
drive. USAPhotoMaps doesn’t discard old data
files as new data is downloaded. If you’ve already
downloaded a series of photos and maps for a
geographic area, you don’t need to connect to
TerraServer-USA again to access that data. The
only limitation to the amount of photo and map
data you can have is the size of your hard drive.
USAPhotoMaps writes all the data it gets from
TerraServer-USA to a single folder, so you can
copy that folder and its data to a CD or DVD. This
is an excellent way to access aerial photos and
maps on a number of different computers that
might not have an Internet connection (such as
laptops in the field). The USAPhotoMaps online
help has instructions on how to do this.

Interfacing with a GPS receiver
Downloading and viewing free aerial photos and maps is pretty cool, but if
you have a GPS receiver, USAPhotoMaps has even more features that you can
put to use, including
 Downloading waypoints, routes, and tracks from a GPS receiver to
overlay on aerial photos and maps. (See Figure 14-6 for an example of an
aerial photo with overlaid track data.)
 Uploading waypoints and routes that you’ve created with USAPhotoMaps
to your GPS receiver.
 Interfacing USAPhotoMaps to a GPS receiver for real-time updates of
your current position shown on an aerial photo or topographic map.
USAPhotoMaps has a separate help file that covers only GPS-related topics.
You’ll find comprehensive information on interfacing your GPS receiver to
the program and descriptions of GPS-related features. To display the help file,
choose Help from the GPS menu.

Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Click the mouse to add a waypoint wherever the cursor is currently positioned.
You’ll be prompted to enter a description and a name (to identify the waypoint
if you upload it to a GPS receiver). The waypoint will be displayed as a dot on
the aerial photo or the map. Right-click the mouse button to display a list of
waypoints.
Reviewing Other Aerial Photo Software
USAPhotoMaps isn’t the only program that uses TerraServer-USA data to dis-
play aerial photos and maps. Other mapping utilities have the same basic func-
tionality with additional features. These programs are inexpensive, ranging
from free to around $60. If you like USAPhotoMaps, take the time to download
and try a few of these programs to see whether they meet your mapping needs.
TerraClient
Bill Friedrich’s TerraClient is a free, easy-to-use Windows program that dis-
plays TerraServer-USA aerial photos and maps. It doesn’t interface with GPS
239
Chapter 14: From the Air with USAPhotoMaps
Importing tracks
USAPhotoMaps can interface directly with your GPS receiver and download current track data.
However, if you want to import existing GPS track logs into USAPhotoMaps, the data needs to be in
a comma-delimited text file in the following order:
Track name, UTM zone, Northing, Easting, Hour, Minute, Second, Month, Date, Year, Altitude (in meters)
The first line of the file contains the field information and should exactly read as follows:
Track,UTM Zone,UTM Northing,UTM Easting,Hour,Min,Sec,Month,Date,Year,
Alt(Meters)
The second line of the file starts listing the track data. An example line of data looks like this:
SKI,10,4873291,605991,17,56,30,11,29,2003,1935.27
Each line of data must have ten commas and end with a carriage return. The minimum amount of track
data required is the UTM zone, Northing, and Easting.
Probably the easiest way to manipulate previously saved track data is to load a comma-delimited
file containing the tracks into a spreadsheet and then arrange the columns of data.

receivers or use GPS data, but it does have two features that make it ideal for
beginning map users:
 Easy location lookup: Instead of knowing the exact coordinates of the
area you want to view, enter a place name and watch TerraClient return
a list of possible matches. To view the aerial photo, click the one you’re
interested in.
 Superimposed maps: This is a very slick feature that allows you to super-
impose a topographic map on top of an aerial photo (see Figure 14-7 for
an example). You can control the transparency of the overlay so that
only a faded, ghostlike image of the map appears on top of the aerial
photograph. This is very useful for quickly identifying features on aerial
photos.
TerraClient has an extremely user-friendly interface, and you can be up and
running the program in a matter of minutes. You can download TerraClient at
http://billfriedrich.tripod.com.

TopoFusion
Scott and Alan Morris, brothers and computer science graduate students,
weren’t satisfied with the various Windows mapping programs on the market,
so they wrote their own. Both are avid mountain bikers, GPS users, and 
outdoor recreationists; the features in their program reflect this. Some of
TopoFusion’s features include
 Optimized graphics routines for fast map display
 Terrain profiles of GPS tracks
 Multiple track file support for constructing trail networks
 Map digital photo support by determining the location where a photo
was taken by correlating the photo time-stamps with those of the track
points
 Trip playback mode that replays your travel route and provides statistics
 Combining aerial photos with topographic maps for composite images
The Morris brothers are constantly adding new and useful features to the
program and have an online support forum. If you’re using a GPS receiver as
part of a trail-mapping project or you are a serious outdoor enthusiast, the
advanced features of TopoFusion should put it high on your list.
To download a free demo version of TopoFusion and get more information
about the program, go to www.topofusion.com. (See the demo version in
Figure 14-8.)
ExpertGPS
TopoGrafix is a software company that produces GPS and mapping programs.
ExpertGPS is an extensive waypoint, route, and track management system
with mapping capabilities grafted on top of it. (See Figure 14-9 for ExpertGPS
displaying a waypoint list and overlaying waypoints and routes on an aerial
photo.)
ExpertGPS has a large number of features. In fact, at first glance, the extensive
features and user interface can be a little intimidating. However, if you’re a GPS
power user with a large collection of waypoints and route data, it’s definitely
worth spending some time working with the program to see whether it meets
your needs.

QuakeMap
QuakeMap is written by Sergei Grichine and was originally designed to down-
load worldwide earthquake data from various Internet sources and display the
information on maps. The program has since evolved into a general purpose,
mapping utility that uses TerraServer-USA data. You can use GPS data with
QuakeMap, and if you’re a geocacher (see Chapter 7), the program has several
specialized features designed for the sport.

Creating and Using Digital 
Maps with OziExplorer
In This Chapter
 Discovering OziExplorer
 Converting paper maps to digital maps
 Scanning and editing digital maps
 Calibrating digital maps
O
ziExplorer is a popular, Windows shareware program that you can use to
create your own digital maps. OziExplorer is widely used by recreation-
ists, land managers, and public safety agencies. The program doesn’t come
bundled with a set of maps per se; instead, you can use it to view maps that
are commercially or freely available on the Internet in a number of different
data formats, from which you can create your own do-it-yourself, digital maps.
In this chapter, I describe some of OziExplorer’s features and then I walk you
through the process of creating digital maps from scanned paper maps.
Discovering OziExplorer Features
OziExplorer is a powerful and versatile mapping program developed by Des
Newman. (Newman hails from Australia, and Ozi is slang for Australia — get
it?). Newman originally wrote the program for personal use during four-wheel-
drive trips in the Australian outback. He released OziExplorer as shareware,
which has evolved into a sophisticated mapping tool that’s constantly updated.
Some of the program’s key features are that it
 Interfaces with GPS receivers: OziExplorer can communicate with just
about every GPS receiver on the market, allowing you to upload and
download waypoints, routes, and tracks to and from GPS receivers and
PCs. (For more on waypoints, routes, and tracks, see Chapter 4.)

 Works in many languages: Localized versions of OziExplorer are available
in a number of different languages, including English, German, French,
Spanish, and Italian.
 Provides real-time tracking: If you have a laptop connected to a GPS
receiver, OziExplorer displays a moving map with your real-time, current
position and other travel information. (For more on using a laptop in
tandem with a GPS receiver, see Chapter 9.)
 Is easy to use: OziExplorer boasts a large number of features, such as
annotating maps and extensive import and export capabilities, all of
which are easy to use. Figure 15-1 shows a demo map that comes with
OziExplorer and the program’s toolbar and menu-based user interface.
 Supports an extensive number of map formats: OziExplorer can access
many popular digital map data formats (such as DRG, a Digital Raster
Graphics map) and can associate georeferenced data with common graph-
ics file types. For example, you can take a file that you created in Paint
or some other graphic program and turn it into a smart map (a map where
geographic coordinates are associated with individual pixels). Loading
graphics files and calibrating the data to create digital maps are discussed
in upcoming sections of this chapter.
Figure 15-1:
A demo 
map in
OziExplorer.
246
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

The best way to find out about OziExplorer’s features is to download the pro-
gram and try it. (OziExplorer works with PCs capable of running Windows 95
through XP.). You can find it at www.oziexplorer.com. Two versions of the
program come in the install package:
 Trial: The trial version is a limited version of OziExplorer that has all the
program features enabled, except the program can’t
• Communicate with GPS receivers
• Save or load waypoints, routes, or tracks
• Save maps as image files
• Run for more than an hour at a time
 Shareware: The shareware version has a number of features disabled
and has the following limitations:
• Only bitmap (BMP) images can be imported as maps (as opposed
to many graphics file types in the registered version).
• Only two points can be used to calibrate a map, reducing the
potential accuracy. (Up to nine points are available in the regis-
tered version.)
• Limited support is available for map projections, grid systems, and
datums (compared with extensive support in the full version).
Between these two programs available in the install package, you’ll be able to
get a feel for all OziExplorer’s capabilities. And when you register the share-
ware version, the full monty of features is enabled. The $85 registration fee is
a nominal investment considering the many features that the full version of
OziExplorer offers.
If you’re looking for a street and road navigation program, OziExplorer isn’t
the best choice. Ozi is more suited for adventures off the beaten path. If you
need a program that helps you find the best route between two addresses on
streets and highways, you’re much better off using some of the commercial
mapping programs that I describe in Chapter 12.
For more practical information on OziExplorer, including troubleshooting tips,
check out the popular Yahoo! Groups e-mail list and forum devoted to the
program at groups.yahoo.com/group/OziUsers-L.
In addition to OziExplorer, Des Newman also has two other related mapping
programs:
247
Chapter 15: Creating and Using Digital Maps with OziExplorer

 OziExplorer3D: This program is used in conjunction with OziExplorer to
display maps in three dimensions. OziExplorer writes elevation data to a
file, which OziExplorer3D uses to display a 3-D representation of the map.
OziExplorer3D is priced at $30.
 OziExplorerCE: OziExplorerCE is moving-map software for Pocket PC
(formerly known as Windows CE) PDAs. You create maps and plan trips
with OziExplorer on your PC and then download the map data to your
PDA to use with OziExplorerCE. When you connect your PDA to a GPS
receiver, the program retrieves GPS data and displays your current loca-
tion on a map. The PDA version of Ozi costs $30.
To discover more about the features of these two programs and download
demonstration versions, go to www.oziexplorer.com.
Moving from Paper to Digital Maps
OziExplorer supports a number of different digital map types that use georef-
erenced data (information that allows a program to precisely identify locations
and coordinates on a map). But one of the program’s most powerful features
is its ability to turn your own graphics files into georeferenced maps. This
means if you have a paper map, you can scan it, load it into OziExplorer, and
effectively make it an electronic (digital) map. This is a three-step process:
1. Scan the map.
Use a scanner to create a digital image of the paper map. Stitch individual
map pieces, if necessary.
2. Edit the map.
Make changes to the scanned map before it’s used.
3. Calibrate the map.
Load the edited map into OziExplorer and associate georeferenced data
with the map image.
The following sections explore the above three steps in further detail.
Scanning and calibrating your own maps can be fairly time consuming and
sometimes frustrating if you can’t seem to get the map coordinates to match
up with reality. Some maps are definitely easier to calibrate than others. If
you’re not technically inclined or are somewhat impatient, you’ll probably
want to stick to importing maps that are already georeferenced, such as freely
available United States Geological Survey (USGS) DRG topographic maps.
(See Chapter 21 for places on the Internet you can download free maps.)
248
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Step 1: Scan the map
The first step when converting a paper map to a digital map is to scan the
map and turn it into a graphics file. You don’t need an expensive, high-end
scanner to accomplish this task; most any color scanner will work.
If you want to scan a large map — say, anything bigger than a legal size piece
of paper — consider literally cutting it up into pieces that will fit on your
scanner. (8.5 x 11 inches works well.) Instead of using a pair of scissors, use a
paper cutter, such as those found at copy centers, to ensure that you end up
with straight cuts. The straight cuts are important for accurately aligning the
map on your scanner. Although you can scan a large map one portion at a
time without cutting it, it’s more of a challenge to get the edges lined up when
you stitch them together as I discuss next.
Here are some tips to improve your map scanning:
 Use medium dpi: Scanning the map between 125–200 dots per inch (dpi)
is good enough; you don’t need to scan at higher resolutions typically
used for reproducing photos.
 Use color photo scanning: Most scanning software has different settings
for different types of documents you want to scan, such as text, line
drawings, and photographs. Select the color photograph option to retain
the most detail. However, remember that most maps don’t have millions
of colors like photographs, so if your scanning software supports it, use
a 256-color setting.
 Watch edge alignment: Place the to-be-scanned map directly on the
scanner, ensuring that the edges are aligned directly against the scanner
bed with no gaps. You need to keep the paper map as square as possible
to reduce distortion during a scan.
 Prevent edge distortion: To help keep the map edges pressed flat, leave
the scanner cover open and use a book or something heavy to set on
top of the map. The edges are typically where the most distortion
occurs during scanning because they tend to lift up.
 Experiment with settings: Try a couple of experimental scans first,
changing the brightness and contrast settings. If you’re going to be scan-
ning a number of maps over a period of time, write down the settings
that gave you the best output so you can use them next time.
 Save the final scan as BMP: When you’re ready to produce a final scan
of the map, initially save it as bitmap (BMP) format file. This produces
an image that’s as close to the original map as possible; bitmap files
aren’t compressed like JPG and other graphics file formats. Bitmap files
do take up a lot of memory and disk space, but after you edit a file, you
can save it as another graphics format that’s smaller in size.
249
Chapter 15: Creating and Using Digital Maps with OziExplorer

If you have a map that’s made up of multiple image files, such as a large map
cut up into a series of smaller maps, you’ll need to stitch them and a single,
large image. Commercial graphics program such as Adobe Photoshop and
Jasc Paint Shop Pro have commands for combining files. You can also manually
stitch together images with Microsoft Paint by using the Paste From command
of the Edit menu. Here’s a link to a great tutorial on stitching together scanned
images: www.sibleyfineart.com/index.htm?tutorial—join-scans.htm.
Step 2: Edit the map
After you successfully scan the map, make any last-minute changes to the
image. This could include
 Adjusting the brightness and contrast to make the map more readable.
 Adding symbols or text information.
 Removing the white space (or collar as it’s known in map-speak) that
surrounds the map.
Use your favorite graphics program to make any final edits to the map image.
After you’re through, save the map as a TIFF, PNG, or JPG file to reduce how
much disk and memory space the image takes up. (These compressed file
formats are more space-efficient and memory-efficient.)

OziExplorer and World War I
The 1980s movie Gallipoli recounted the
Australian experience of fighting the Turks
during World War I. Although long before the
time of computers and mapping software, WWI
also has a link to OziExplorer.
Howard Anderson wrote a fascinating article on
using OziExplorer to locate old World War I
trench lines in France and Belgium. The remains
of the trenches are long gone, but by using old
maps from the period, scanning them, and adding
georeferenced data, Anderson was able to
clearly determine where the trenches were dug
during the early 1900s.
After he had scanned and georeferenced the
old military maps, Anderson used OziExplorer to
draw GPS tracks on personally created digital
maps to trace the outlines of the trenches. He
also used waypoints to identify military and land
features. Anderson then took the tracks and
waypoints and overlaid them on a modern map
in OziExplorer. This revealed where the long-
ago war emplacements once stood. Anderson’s
last step was to visit France with a GPS receiver
and his old and modern maps. He found that,
with relative accuracy, he could stand on the
site of a trench where his grandfather had
fought over 85 years ago.
To read Anderson’s complete account, which
has historical insights as well as his experi-
ences in using OziExplorer, visit the Western
Front Association’s Web site at www.western
frontassociation.com/thegreatwar/
articles/trenchmaps/stand.htm.

The shareware version of OziExplorer can load only BMP images. Because
bitmaps aren’t compressed, the entire file must be loaded into memory,
which can slow down the performance of computers that don’t have 
much RAM.
Step 3: Calibrate the map
After you scan, edit, and save your map, one more step is left before you can
start using the map with OziExplorer. At this point, your map is simply a graph-
ics file. You can use Microsoft Paint or any another graphics program to view,
edit, and print the map, but you want to turn the image into a smart map to
take advantage of OziExplorer’s features.
This involves calibrating the map, which involves linking georeferenced data
with the map image so that each pixel in the map has a geographic coordinate
associated with it. When a map has georeferenced data, you can
 Move the cursor on the map, and OziExplorer will accurately report the
coordinates of the cursor in latitude and longitude or UTM (Universal
Transverse Mercator; read more about these in Chapter 2).
 Draw lines on the map to measure distance.
 Calculate the size of areas.
 Track and display your current position on the map when the computer
is connected to a GPS receiver.
 Transfer GPS waypoints, routes, and tracks between the map and a GPS
receiver.
When you calibrate a map with OziExplorer, the georeferenced data isn’t
embedded directly inside the image file. OziExplorer creates a separate MAP
file (.map) that contains the following information:
 The location of the map image file
 The map datum
 The map projection
 Map calibration data
Inside a MAP file, the file is in text format and can be viewed with any word
processor.
Calibration requires you to identify a series of points on the map with known
coordinates. Depending on the number of points that you select, as well as
the map datum and projection, OziExplorer performs different mathematical
calculations to link coordinate information with the map image.
251
Chapter 15: Creating and Using Digital Maps with OziExplorer

To demonstrate the process of calibrating a map with OziExplorer, use a
scanned copy of a 1:100,000 scale USGS topographic map. (Check out 
Chapter 21 for sources of free maps.)
252
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 
FUGAWI
FUGAWI is a popular Windows mapping pro-
gram with some of the same basic features as
OziExplorer.
Like OziExplorer, FUGAWI can read a number of
different map formats with georeferenced data
as well as use do-it-yourself, calibrated, scanned
image maps. The program can also interface
with a GPS receiver and handle waypoints,
routes, and tracks. See a FUGAWI map in the
figure here.
Comparing FUGAWI with OziExplorer, you’ll see
that FUGAWI isn’t shareware, it’s priced a little
higher, and it comes bundled with a base set of
maps.
FUGAWI and OziExplorer both have extremely
loyal user bases. If you check around the Internet,
you’ll see some strong feelings expressed about
why one product is better than the other. (I think
OziExplorer has a better user interface and sup-
ports a few more advanced features.) If you’re
considering FUGAWI or OziExplorer, download
the free demo versions of each program and see
which one you prefer.
For more information about FUGAWI and to
download the demo version of the software, visit
www.fugawi.com.

Some digital maps have georeferenced data embedded directly into the map
image as tags or come with associated files that contain the reference data. (A
common example is a DRG map.) OziExplorer can use these maps without going
through the calibration process that I describe next. Check the OziExplorer Web
site or the program’s online help for a full list of these supported map types.
Choosing calibration points
To associate georeferenced data with your scanned map, you’ll need to find a
series of points on the map with coordinates you know. If you can’t assign a
latitude and longitude (or UTM) position to a few features on the map, you
won’t be able to calibrate the map.
Here are some ways in which you can pick calibration points:
 If the scanned map has a collar with coordinates printed on the edge,
use the coordinate marks. USGS topographic maps are easy to calibrate
because each corner is marked with the latitude and longitude.
 Use another mapping program (such as those described in Chapter 14)
to get the coordinates of a feature on a map that you want to calibrate.
This can be a man-made feature (such as a building or a bridge) or a nat-
ural feature (such as a mountain peak).
 If you’re in the United States, you can use National Geodetic Survey data-
sheets to identify points on the ground that have known coordinates
associated with them. Visit www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/datasheet.
prl to access datasheets for your area.
 Visit a location that’s clearly identifiable on the map, and use your GPS
receiver to record the coordinates for that location. Road intersections
make good calibration points. (Just watch out for traffic!)
The number of points that you select for calibration depends on the map and
how much accuracy you want. Use the following guidelines to determine how
many points you should use:
 Two points: If you’re limited to two calibration points, select two points
at opposite corners of the map. (This is the only calibration method
available in the shareware version of OziExplorer.)
If you have a registered version of OziExplorer, always choose at least
three calibration points, such as three corners of a map.
 Three or four points: Selecting three or four points (such as the map
corners) provides better map accuracy and should be all you need for
calibrating most maps.
 Five or more points: If the latitude and longitude lines are curved, if the
paper map has been folded, or if the scan of the map is distorted, use
more than four points. OziExplorer supports up to nine calibration points;
generally, the more points you choose, the better the accuracy with any
map that might have distortions that could impact accuracy.
253
Chapter 15: Creating and Using Digital Maps with OziExplorer

Try to spread your calibration points out over as much of the map as possi-
ble. If you clump the points together in a small area, the accuracy won’t be as
precise.
After you look at the map and determine which calibration points you’re
going to use, write down the coordinates and then double-check that they’re
correct. Entering calibration points with incorrect coordinates is a common
cause of map accuracy troubles.
In Figure 15-2, the example USGS topographic map was scanned in pieces,
stitched, and then saved as a JPG file. The original paper map had the latitude
and longitude coordinates in all four corners, so I use these coordinates as
the calibration points. (This map is too large to reproduce here, so note that
you can see the coordinates only in the upper-left corner.)
Setting calibration points
After you decide which points you’ll use to calibrate the map, load the map
image file into OziExplorer and do some georeferencing. Here are the steps
to take:
1. Select Load and Calibrate Map Image from the File menu; a file dialog
box is displayed.
2. Select the location of the map image file and click Open.
The map appears in a setup window, as shown in Figure 15-3.
Figure 15-2:

254
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

3. Enter the map’s name, datum, and projection.
Information provided on the example paper map says the datum is 
NAD 27 and the projection is Universal Transverse Mercator. Enter 
those values. (To read about map datums and projections, check out
Chapter 2.)
If you don’t know the map datum, make an educated guess or use WGS
84. If you don’t know the map projection, try using Latitude/Longitude.
Both of these settings can be changed later if they end up incorrect.
Entering the wrong map datum and projection can severely affect the
accuracy of your map. If you don’t know the datum and projection, 
your best bet when calibrating the map is to match coordinates that 
you recorded with your GPS receiver to features that you can clearly
identify on the map; then use the WGS 84 datum and Latitude/Longitude
projection.
4. For each calibration point (up to nine points), repeat the following
steps:
a. Click the point’s tab in the setup window.
Figure 15-4 shows Point 1.
b. Move the cursor on the map over the point.
Figure 15-3:
The
OziExplorer

dow with a

255
Chapter 15: Creating and Using Digital Maps with OziExplorer

The cursor turns into a cross-hair icon with the number 1 next to
it. A zoom window shows a magnified image of the cursor location
allowing you to precisely place the cursor over the calibration point.
c. Click the left mouse button to select the calibration point.
A bull’s-eye appears over the calibration point.
After the bull’s-eye appears onscreen, you can move the calibration
point to a new location by holding down the Shift key and using the
navigational arrow keys. This gives you a fine level of control over
placing the calibration point.
d. Enter either the latitude and longitude or the UTM coordinates for the
calibration point.
OziExplorer expects the latitude and longitude coordinates to be
expressed in degrees and decimal minutes. If your coordinates are
in another latitude and longitude format, you can quickly convert
them at this Web site: http://jeeep.com/details/coord.
5. When you’re finished, click Save.
OziExplorer prompts you for a name and where to save the MAP file.
You’re now ready to start using your imported map. The example
scanned-and-calibrated map being used with tracks and waypoints is
show in Figure 15-5.
Figure 15-4:

256
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Maps that are made for general information purposes (such as park visitor
maps or maps in textbooks) are usually difficult to calibrate correctly because
they don’t have the level of accuracy as navigation or survey maps do. (In fact,
they’re more of diagrams — not maps — because they don’t have projections.)
The actual locations of features shown on the map might not be correct, and
distances and proportions might not be accurate.
Checking your work
After you load and calibrate a scanned map, always check to make sure that
your calibration was correct. Here are some ways to do this:
 Select Grid Line Setup from the Map menu. This allows you to overlay
latitude and longitude grid lines over the map. The overlaid grid lines
should match with the grid lines on the map or the coordinate marks on
the map edges.
On USGS topographic maps, don’t get latitude and longitude lines con-
fused with the more predominant Township and Range lines. (To find
out the difference between latitude and longitude and Township and
Range, read Chapter 2.)
Figure 15-5:

and
calibrated

and tracks.
257
Chapter 15: Creating and Using Digital Maps with OziExplorer

 If your scanned map has a ruler printed on the map that shows distance
(for example, in one-mile increments), select Distance Display from the
View menu. This allows you to measure the distance of a line that you
draw on the map. The length of the map’s ruler should match whatever
distance is shown when you measure it.
 Move the cursor over a feature on the map with known coordinates. (The
coordinates can come from a GPS receiver, another mapping program, or
a gazetteer.) The cursor coordinates in OziExplorer should be relatively
close to the known coordinates of the feature.
If any coordinate or distance numbers seem significantly off, there’s likely a
problem with your calibration. To address this, do the following:
1. Choose Check Calibration of Map from the File menu.
This displays the calibration setup window.
2. In the calibration setup window, verify or change calibration data.
• Make sure that your calibration points are in the proper location
on the map and have the correct coordinates.
• Try changing the map datum and/or projection to different values.
3. Click Save to save the results to a different MAP file.
The newly calibrated map is loaded and is displayed onscreen.
4. Check whether the calibration is more accurate.
If the calibration isn’t sufficiently accurate, repeat these steps.

Going Three Dimensional 
with 3DEM
In This Chapter
 Creating 3-D maps with DEM data
 Navigating inside 3-D maps
 Merging DEM and DRG data for 3-D overlays
 Reviewing other 3-D map programs
T
he freeware program 3DEM is a popular 3-D mapping program for
Windows. In this chapter, I show you how easy it is to make 3-D maps of
your own with 3DEM’s features and freely available Digital Elevation Model
(DEM) data. You’ll discover how to create basic 3-D elevation maps, navigate
inside the maps, and overlay topographic maps on top of the 3-D images to
create some pretty stunning, professional-looking maps. At the end of the chap-
ter, I review several other 3-D mapping programs that are similar to 3DEM.
Comparing 2-D and 3-D Maps
A 2-D digital map can give you a pretty good sense of place (see Chapters 13
and 19 for examples of what 2-D contour maps look like), but a 3-D map can
really help you understand your surroundings. You can clearly see where
mountains rise up from the flats and canyons sink down from plateaus. 3-D
mapping programs display terrain features by either
 Using shading to show elevation changes (also known as shaded relief )
 Creating layered models of the terrain, just like a layer cake, with each
layer representing a different elevation

With a 3-D map, instead of relying on contour lines to understand the terrain,
the land features jump out at you and are immediately obvious. Professional
map users such as surveyors, land managers, and public safety officials use 3-D
maps in addition to 2-D maps because they provide a different perspective when
looking at landforms. With a 3-D map, it’s also much easier to show what the
terrain is really like to someone who’s unfamiliar with reading contour maps.
Discovering 3DEM Capabilities
3DEM allows you to visualize terrain in three dimensions. Its name is a play on
words, referring to three-dimensional as well as Digital Elevation Model (DEM),
which is the data the program uses to create maps. With 3DEM, you can
 Create and save 3-D maps based on elevation data.
 Change the view and perspective of 3-D maps.
 Overlay topographic maps on top of 3-D images.
 Identify coordinates on maps.
Developer Richard Horne made the program straightforward and easy to use.
It’s fast because it uses the SGI/Microsoft OpenGL libraries for image rendering.
Time to put 3DEM to work. In the following sections, I use 3DEM to create some
three-dimensional maps. If you want to follow along with the examples, point
your Web browser to www.visualizationsoftware.com/3dem.html and
download 3DEM.
You might be wondering why the program icon associated with 3DEM is a pair
of sunglasses with one red lens and one blue lens. 3DEM has an option to dis-
play images that look even more three-dimensional if you’re wearing special
3-D glasses with red and blue lenses. (Yup, just like cheesy movies such as
that 50s horror classic, House of Wax, where you wear the same kind of glasses,
and it looks like Vincent Price is jumping out of the screen at you.) If you don’t
have a pair of 3-D glasses lying around the office, visit www.3dglassesonline.
com where you can get a pair for the price of a self-addressed envelope and
postage.
Using DEM Data to Create a Map
The first step in using 3DEM is to load a DEM file. DEM (Digital Elevation
Model) is a file format that contains elevation data. DEM files are produced
by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and cover most all land areas
in the U.S. Frugal mapmakers can retrieve free DEM files from many sites on
the Internet.
260
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Chapter 21 covers Web sites where you can download DEM files and other free
map data. The 3DEM online Help also has several sources for no-cost DEM
data. In your search for DEM data, be aware that elevation data can often be
found in Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) format files. You’ll need the
free utility SDTS2DEM to convert SDTS data into DEM files that can be used
with the programs discussed in this chapter. You can download SDTS2DEM at
www.cs.arizona.edu/topovista/sdts2dem.
For this example, I use a DEM associated with the area around Mount 
St. Helens, the volcano in Washington State that erupted in 1980. Mount St.
Helens is interesting because instead of blowing straight up, it blew out 
the side. This (and a small dome in the center of the crater) makes the still
active volcano a good candidate to view three-dimensionally.
To follow along as I create a 3-D map, download the DEM file used in this
example from the University of Washington’s Department of Geology Web
site. Here’s how:
1. Go to http://duff.geology.washington.edu/data/watiles/
index.html.
2. Click the Hoquiam grid.
3. Click the 10-meter DEMs link.
Just a quick note about DEMs. You’ll often see references to 10-meter
DEMs and 30-meter DEMs. These numbers refer to the elevation data
resolution: The smaller the number, the higher the resolution. For exam-
ple, with a 10-meter DEM, the ground spacing between elevation points
is 10 meters.
4. Click the Mount Saint Helens grid on the map (in the lower-right corner).
A Zip file (f2323.zip) downloads to your computer. The file is a bit
over 2MB and contains a compressed version of the DEM file for Mount
St. Helens.
5. Uncompress the Zip file to access the DEM file.
If you’re using Windows XP, double-click the Zip file to open it, and then
copy the f2323.dem file and paste it in a folder to uncompress and save it.
If you’re not using Windows XP, you need a utility to uncompress the Zip
file and extract the DEM data. I like the free file archiver 7-Zip, which is
available at www.7-zip.org.
After you have a DEM file to work with, load it into 3DEM. This is simple:
1. Run 3DEM.
2. Choose Load Terrain Model from the File menu.
3. In the DEM File Type dialog box, make sure that USGS DEM is selected
and then click OK.
261
Chapter 16: Going Three Dimensional with 3DEM

4. Select the DEM file you want to use (in this case, the f2323.dem file
from the preceding steps) and then click Open.
3DEM displays a message that the DEM file is loading. After a few seconds
(or minutes if you have a slow computer), a shaded image of the DEM
file is displayed, which looks like you’re viewing the location from directly
overhead.
The image created with the Mount St. Helens DEM file is shown in Figure 16-1.
The volcano crater is clearly visible, with the side of the mountain gone 
from the eruption. You can clearly see the landforms that surround the vol-
cano, and shading is used to show terrain relief.
The DEM data is georeferenced. When you move the cursor around the map,
3DEM displays the latitude, longitude, and elevation of the spot beneath the
cursor.
Click the right mouse button and hold it down while drawing a line on the
map. When you release the mouse button, an elevation profile window is dis-
played that shows a chart with the elevation profile of the line you drew.

262
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Creating a 3-D Map
When you have the DEM data loaded into 3DEM, you can create three-dimen-
sional scenes of the area that’s displayed. It’s dangerous (and illegal) to venture
inside the Mount St. Helens crater in real life, but with 3DEM, you can get a
better idea of what the crater looks like from inside.
Defining the display area
To define the area to display in 3-D, first look on the map for a square with a
notch in the bottom of it. This is the View tool.
 The notch represents the direction you’re looking.
 The square is the area to render in 3-D.
To use the View tool, follow these steps:
1. Move the cursor to where you’d like the view to originate; then click.
This moves the view square to that location.
2. Move the cursor to one of the corners of the view square, and then
click and hold down the left mouse button.
You can resize the square and rotate its position by moving the cursor.
3. Release the mouse button after you define the view area.
263
Chapter 16: Going Three Dimensional with 3DEM
3-D display troubleshooting
If you get an error message, the system crashes,
or the 3-D image isn’t rendered correctly, you
probably have an issue with your graphics card.
 Check for any updated drivers for the card
on the manufacturer’s Web site. If you find
updated drivers, install them.
 If that doesn’t solve the problem, turn off any
accelerator options on the graphics card in
the Windows Display dialog box. The graph-
ics card might conflict with OpenGL 3-D ren-
dering libraries that come with the program.
See the 3DEM online Help for additional details
on troubleshooting drawing problems.

Creating a 3-D scene
After selecting the area, you’re now ready to create a 3-D scene:
1. Choose 3-D Scene from the Operation menu.
2. In the Terrain Projection Parameters dialog box that opens (as shown in
Figure 16-2), enter options to change the appearance of the 3-D image.
For this example, use the default settings.
3. Click OK.
The Terrain Colors dialog box opens (as shown in Figure 16-3). The set-
tings in this dialog box allow you to change the colors of the 3-D image,
such as associating different colors with different elevations. For this
example, use the default settings.
4. Click OK.
3DEM opens a separate window, displaying a smoothed, 3-D image of the
view that you selected. In this example, Figure 16-4 shows the view inside
the Mount St. Helens crater.

Manipulating the 3-D Scene Window
After you create a 3-D map in 3DEM, you can move around the scene to change
your view. With this way-cool feature, you can look at a location from a number
of different perspectives. To move around the scene, do the following:
1. Choose Change Position from the Operation menu.
The Rotate or Shift Scene dialog box opens (see Figure 16-5), in which
you can rotate or shift the scene.
2. Click the control buttons to move the 3-D scene until you are satisfied
with the image.
Control buttons are described after these instructions.
3. Finish up by either
• Clicking OK when you’re done.
• Clicking Reset to restore the scene to its original appearance.
Figure 16-5:
Use this
dialog box
to move
around a

266
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Using the scene control buttons isn’t that intuitive from just looking at the
dialog box. Here’s a brief description of what each of the buttons does:
 Elevation: These buttons control where the image appears in the scene
window.
• Move Up: Moves the image toward the top of the window
• Move Down: Moves the image toward the bottom of the window
 Translation: The Translation buttons zoom in and out and move the
image to the sides.
• Move Closer: Zooms in on the image
• Left: Moves the image to the left of the window
• Right: Moves the image to the right of the window
• Move Away: Zooms out from the image
 Rotation: The Rotation buttons control the angle from which you view
the image.
• Tilt Forward: Moves the image so you look at it from more of an
overhead view.
• Left: Rotates the image to the left.
• Right: Rotates the image to the right.
• Tilt Back: Moves the image so you look at it from more of a direct,
on-the-ground view. You can also use this button to look at the
underside of the image.
 Movement Control: These radio buttons determine how much movement
occurs when you click the control buttons. Movement can be Coarse,
Medium, or Fine.
Saving and Printing a 3DEM Scene
After you have the appearance of a 3DEM scene just how you want it, you can
save the image to disk or print it. The several different options for saving and
printing are all found in the File menu, including
 Save Scene Image: Saves the image in one of nine different graphics for-
mats, including BMP, JPG, and TIFF.
 Save Large Format Image: Saves the image as a large format graphics
file, up to 6,000 pixels wide; you select the size. If you’re creating a map
267
Chapter 16: Going Three Dimensional with 3DEM

for publication purposes, this option is useful for saving a large image
that can be reduced in size yet still retains detail.
 Print Scene Image: Prints the image.
 Save Rotation Animation: Rotates the 3-D image 360 degrees and saves
the output as an AVI file that can be replayed as a movie with Windows
Media Player or other multimedia software.
Overlaying Digital Raster Graphics Data
Using DEM data to create a three-dimensional map is pretty cool, but 3DEM
allows you take one step beyond simple terrain modeling. You can also take a
USGS topographic map and overlay it on top of the DEM data to create a 3-D
topographic map.
To do this, you need a topographic map in Digital Raster Graphics (DRG)
format, which is another map data type produced by the USGS. A DRG file
is a scanned version of a topographic map that has georeferenced data asso-
ciated with it. DRG maps typically come in the TIFF graphics format.
Downloading a sample DRG
If you’ve read this chapter to this point, continue with the running example.
Download the DRG that’s associated with the Mount St. Helens DEM file already
loaded into 3DEM. (See the earlier section, “Using DEM Data to Create a Map.”)
To download the DRG
1. Go to http://duff.geology.washington.edu/data/watiles/
index.html.
2. Click the Hoquiam grid.
3. Click the clipped Digital Raster Graphics link.
The other link at the Web site, Digital Raster Graphics, contains the 
complete (unclipped) 7.5 minute topographic map, including the collar
(the white space border that surrounds the map). 3DEM can remove a
DRG file’s collar so it isn’t displayed in your map; if a clipped version is
available, it saves a bit of processing time.
4. Click the Mount Saint Helens grid on the map (in the lower-right
corner).
The file o46122b2.zip downloads to your computer. The file is a bit over
3MB and contains a compressed version of the DRG for Mount St. Helens.
5. Uncompress the Zip file to access the DRG data.
268
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

Three files are inside the Zip file:
• o46122b2.tfw: Each DRG has an accompanying World file that
contains georeferenced information. The World file has the same
filename as the DRG but typically ends with a .tfw extension.
• o46122b2.tfw83: Another georeferenced data file, this one contains
information for using the NAD 83 datum with the map (which is
close to WGS 84) instead of the NAD 27 datum typically used with
USGS topographic maps. (See Chapter 2 to read about the differ-
ences between different map datums.)
• o46122b2.tif: This is the actual DRG map image file.
3DEM uses just the TIFF map image file; you don’t need to worry
about the other two files.
The TFW files that come with DRGs usually contain redundant georeference
information; the same data is embedded in the map image file as a GeoTIFF
tag. Depending on the software you’re using, the data in the TFW file might
take precedence over the embedded data in the image file for georeferencing
the map image.
Loading the DRG as an overlay
After you uncompress the DRG file, you can load it into 3DEM. Make sure you
have the DEM data loaded first, and then do the following:
1. Choose Apply Map Overlay from the Operation menu.
The Apply Map Overlay dialog box is displayed.
2. Click the Load button.
A file Open dialog box appears.
3. Select the DRG file you want to overlay (in this case, o46122b2.tif),
and then click Open.
A message appears asking you to wait while the data is loaded and is
prepared for overlaying. When the process is finished, the message Geo
Reference Complete appears.
4. Click the Accept button.
3DEM renders the overlay image; a status message appears during over-
lay generation telling you how many lines are left to process.
When 3DEM is finished, the overlay map is displayed.
Instead of showing only a relatively boring terrain elevation map, the
topographic map is merged with the DEM data to create a shaded relief
map that shows labeled features, contour lines, map grids, and a graphic
representation of elevation (as shown in Figure 16-6).

Chapter 16: Going Three Dimensional with 3DEM

You can change the size of the map by choosing Resize Overhead View from
the Operation menu. This brings up the Map Scale dialog box, where you can
use the slider bar to change the image size. Entering a 1 for the Map Scale
value displays the map at a 1:1 ratio. You can move around the map with
scroll bars if it’s too big to fit in the window.

Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 
DRG filenames
So what’s with the numbers in the DRG filename?
Why couldn’t the USGS just have named it after
the name of the topographic map (Mount St.
Helens) to make things easier? There’s actually
some logic behind the file-naming convention of
DRG map files (called the o-code, short for Ohio-
code). Carve the o46122b2 filename to see
what it means:
 46: 46 degrees of latitude.
 122: 122 degrees of longitude.
 b: A row within that latitude and longitude
square. (Rows run south to north and are
labeled a–h.)
 2: A column within the latitude and longitude
square. (Columns run east to west and are
numbered 1–8.)
That makes a little more sense. All USGS DRGs
use this standard, which makes it easy for pro-
grams to figure out which data files should be
used for displaying adjacent maps.

Working with overlay maps
After you create an overlay map, you can print, save, and create 3-D scenes
just like with the map made from the DEM data in the preceding section.
In Figure 16-7, you can see a 3-D scene of inside the Mount St. Helens crater
with overlaid DRG data. Most of the menu and dialog box commands that I
describe in earlier sections of this chapter work the same.
One command that’s unique to working with overlay maps displays the topo-
graphic map without any relief shading (just like the paper version of the map
would appear). To view the overlay map with no relief shading
1. Use the View tool to define the area you want to view. (Move and resize
the view square to choose the area.)
2. Choose Map Overlay View from the Operation menu.
3DEM displays the selected area as a topographic map without shading.
To navigate around the map, use the window scroll bars.
3. To return to the shaded relief overlay map, choose Overhead View
from the Operation menu.

Chapter 16: Going Three Dimensional with 3DEM

Reviewing Other 3DEM Features
3DEM has a number of other features worth mentioning:
 Multiple DEM file support: Instead of loading only a single DEM file at a
time, 3DEM can merge DEMs to create 3-D models of large areas.
 GPS support: Waypoints, routes, and tracks can be downloaded from a
GPS receiver and displayed on maps created by 3DEM.
 Aerial photo overlays: Aerial photographs can be overlaid on DEM data,
just like DRG files, to create three-dimensional photos. (You need to geo-
reference the photos first, which consists of identifying the coordinates
of several known points on the photo.)
 Flyby animation: 3DEM can create animation movies of flying over a
three-dimensional scene.
 Additional data sources: 3DEM isn’t limited to using only DEM and DRG
data. 3DEM can create maps based on elevation data gathered by satel-
lites, the Space Shuttle, and even Mars exploration probes.
After you master the basics of working with 3DEM, spend some time experi-
menting with other program features. 3DEM has an extensive online Help
system that you can use to find out more about all aspects of the program.
If creating 3-D maps interests you, be sure to check out the Virtual Terrain
Project at http://vterrain.org. This Web site is a clearinghouse for 3-D
terrain modeling information. You’ll find a number of links to resources and
tools for creating three-dimensional maps of land forms and both natural and
man-made features.
Other 3-D Mapping Software
3DEM isn’t the only kid on the block when it comes to creating 3-D maps.
Several other free or inexpensive Windows programs are available that you
can use for three-dimensional terrain modeling.
Global Mapper
Global Mapper is an easy-to-use, reasonably priced, and powerful mapping
program that has some of the same features as 3DEM for processing DEM and
DRG data. Global Mapper also has some options typically only found in expen-
sive Geographic Information System (GIS) programs, including
272
Part III: Digital Mapping on Your Computer 

 Extensive map data support: You can view and export a large number of
raster, vector, and elevation map data types.
 Multiple data layers: 3DEM works with only two layers (the elevation data
and the overlay image), but Global Mapper can use multiple layers of data.
 Relief shading: Like 3DEM, Global Mapper can create relief-shaded maps
to show elevation. (Global Mapper doesn’t produce layered 3-D images
or animations.)
 Vector editing: Data in existing vector maps such as areas, lines, and
points can be edited, and new data can be created.
 Contour generation: Contour lines maps can be generated by using ele-
vation data.
 Line-of-sight tools: Global Mapper has a series of tools for determining
line-of-sight between two points and displaying view sheds (areas of 
terrain that can be seen from a certain vantage point). These tools are
especially useful for placing radio transmitters.
A trial version of Global Mapper (with limited features) is available. Folks inter-
ested in digital maps should have this in their tool collection; it can display
just about every digital map data type that’s commonly used. If you get seri-
ous about making maps, consider purchasing the registered version because
of its ability to export data, rectify images (make image data conform to a map
projection system), and support multiple data layers.
You can find more about Global Mapper and download a free trial version 
of the program (a single license registration costs $179) at www.global
mapper.com.
The USGS (www.usgs.gov) distributes the free program dlgv32 Pro for using
DEM and DRG data. This is the same program as the unregistered version of
Global Mapper. Global Mapper is based on the publicly available source code
of an earlier USGS program called dlgv32; DLG stands for Digital Line Graph,
which is a vector map data format.

Chapter 16: Going Three Dimensional with 3DEM
TerraBase II
The U.S. Army Engineer School at Fort Leonard
Wood (www.wood.army.mil/tvc) has a ver-
sion of MICRODEM: TerraBase II. It’s the same
program as MICRODEM but was developed to
train soldiers on terrain analysis and using digital
maps. The school’s Web site has an extensive
collection of screen capture, how-to videos
devoted to using MICRODEM. Although the AVI
videos are more oriented to military users, they’re
still very helpful in finding how to get the most
out of MICRODEM for civilian purposes.

MICRODEM
MICRODEM is a free Windows mapping program written by Peter Guth of the
U.S. Naval Academy, Department of Oceanography. The program uses DEM
data to create terrain maps, contour maps, topographic profiles, and 3-D
scenes. The software can also overlay raster and vector data.
MICRODEM contains an impressive collection of features, including powerful
options for manipulating and analyzing geographic data. It also supports many
different map data types. These features can be a little overwhelming to a
new user, and you really should spend some time reading the documentation
to understand its capabilities before using the program. MICRODEM is well
suited for the advanced digital map user.
You can download MICRODEM (the full install package is over 30MB) from
www.usna.edu/Users/oceano/pguth/website/microdem.htm.
Bundled map programs
If you’re not that excited about finding and downloading DEM and DRG files
for making your own 3-D maps, you can purchase a commercial software
package that comes with map data and supports three-dimensional terrain
views. These commercial programs don’t have as many options for creating
custom 3-D images compared with 3DEM, Global Mapper, and MICRODEM,
but they’re very easy to use. Some programs to consider include
 Maptech Terrain Navigator
 DeLorme Topo USA and 3-D TopoQuads
 National Geographic TOPO!
I discuss these map products in more detail in Chapter 13.

In this part . . .
T
he deal with this part is there are a whole lot of map-
ping resources on the Web that are free. You know all of
those commercial programs in Part III that you have to shell
out bucks for? In many cases you can get the same basic
functionality (that means without the advanced features
found in commercial programs) for free, simply by knowing
the right place to point your Web browser. This part dis-
cusses how to access and use online street maps, topo-
graphic maps, aerial photos, and slick U.S. government-
produced maps. You’ll also learn how to save and edit all of
those wonderful, free Web-hosted maps.

W
hen you need to tell someone how to get somewhere, Web-hosted
mapping services are a great resource for creating maps, especially 
if you’re artistically challenged. You get a professional looking map by typing
some text and clicking a few buttons.
However, a Web map might not exactly meet your needs. Maybe it’s missing a
street name, or you want to add a few colored arrows to show a route through
a confusing set of streets. Most map Web sites don’t have many options to
customize a map.
This chapter has everything you need to customize a basic Web map. You’ll
also find tips and hints on how to make your own maps, using a Web map as
the foundation. After you edit the map, you can
 Attach it to an e-mail.
 Paste it into a word processing document.
 Post it on a Web site.
 Print it on party invitations.
You’re not going to become a world-class cartographer overnight, but you
can produce some pretty good-looking maps.
The techniques in this chapter apply to any digital map. If you’re using a
mapping program, you can use the same methods to copy and save parts of
any map that’s onscreen.

Saving Maps
Most Web-hosted mapping services don’t have an option for saving a map to
your hard drive. You can print the map, e-mail it, or maybe save a part of it so
you can upload to a personal digital assistant (PDA), but there’s no command
to save the map as a file.
Here are three paths around this roadblock:
 Right-click the map and choose Save Picture As.
 Use the Print Screen key.
 Use a screen capture program.
Save Picture As
After you display a map on a Web site, some Web sites let you save the map
to disk with a little-known browser command. Follow these steps:
1. Make the map the size that you want it in your Web browser.
When a screen capture is stored on the Clipboard, it’s saved in bitmap
(.bmp) format. Bitmaps don’t scale very well, so you end up with jagged
lines or a blurry image if you shrink or enlarge the map in your graphics
program.
2. Right-click the map.
3. Choose Save Picture As (or Save Image As, depending on your
browser).
4. Select the file directory location to save the image.
The map picture is saved as a file to the directory location that you select.
278
Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 
Captured: Screen capture programs
Lots of screen capture programs are available on
the Internet. Most are either shareware or free-
ware. Two of my favorites are
 SnagIt: A commercial screen capture utility
that’s been around since the first versions
of Windows. It has a number of powerful
features. It’s available at www.techsmith.
com/products/snagit/default.
asp.
 MWSnap: If you’re on a budget, this is an
excellent freeware screen capture utility with
lots of features. It’s easy on system resources,
too. It’s available at www.mirekw.com/
winfreeware/mwsnap.html.

Using the Print Screen key
Before Windows appeared on personal computers, the Print Screen key on 
a PC keyboard sent a copy of the monitor screen to the local printer. When
Windows was introduced, things changed. Here’s what happens now:
 Press Print Screen only. The entire screen is copied to the Clipboard.
 Press Print Screen while you hold down Alt. The active window is
copied to the Clipboard.
Using the Print Screen options are handy if a Web site has disabled the Save
Picture As menu command or if the Web map isn’t being stored as a graphics
file that can be easily saved.
Pressing Print Screen or Alt+Print Screen sometimes copies parts of the screen
that don’t have anything to do with the map, such as menus, title bars, and
buttons. If you don’t want these on your map, you can either use a screen
capture program instead of Print Screen or manually edit the map in a graph-
ics program. This chapter explains both.
Different keyboards label the Print Screen key different ways. It might be Print
Screen, PrintScreen, PrtSc, or something else, but you should be able to spot
it. The key usually is to the right of the F12 function key.
Follow these steps to save a Web page map with Print Screen:
1. Display the map in the size you want to save.
Map Web sites usually can show maps in several sizes.
2. Press Alt+Print Screen to save the active window to the Clipboard.
This is more efficient than capturing the entire screen with just the Print
Screen key.
After the map is on the Clipboard
1. Run a graphics program such as Paint.
2. Use the Paste menu command to insert the Clipboard image into a
new file.
3. Save the file.
Using screen capture programs
Screen capture programs provide more options and flexibility than the Print
Screen key. For example, you can select part of the screen and copy it. You
just save the map without editing all the clutter around it.
279
Chapter 17: Saving and Editing Street Maps

Although screen capture programs have different user interfaces, they gener-
ally work like this:
1. Run the screen capture program.
2. Assign a hot key (usually either a function key or a combination of
control keys) that starts the screen capture.
3. Make the map the size you want it in your Web browser.
4. Press the hot key.
5. Click and draw a rectangle over the region of the screen that you
want to capture.
6. Use the capture command to copy the screen region to the Clipboard.
This command will vary depending on the screen capture program you’re
using. Depending on the screen capture program used, a copy of that
piece of the screen is either placed on the Clipboard or directly saved
to a file that you name.
Figure 17-1 shows a Web map selected with the MWSnap screen capture pro-
gram to place in the Clipboard.

Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 

Editing a Map
Editing a saved map is just a matter of opening the saved file with a graphics
program. The graphics program can be as basic as the Paint accessory pro-
gram that comes with Windows or as sophisticated as a commercial, high-end
design program.
A simple graphics program like Paint is fine if you’re not making a lot of
changes.
If you’ve got an itch to be a cartographer and want to go beyond using gen-
eral graphics programs, check out Map Maker, a popular commercial desktop
mapping program. You can get a free, limited-feature version called Map Maker
Gratis at www.mapmaker.com.
Almost all Web maps have text at the bottom with copyright information and
where the map came from. Leave it intact to respect the copyright and to credit
the company that provided the map.
Opening a file
If you used Print Screen or a screen capture program, you need to get the map
into the graphics program so that you can edit it. Follow these steps to load a
map so you can edit it:
1. Run the graphics program.
2. If one isn’t already onscreen, open a new file.
3. In the Edit menu, select the Paste command. Or, if you’ve previously
saved the map to a file, use the Open command in the File menu to
open it.
The map image is loaded, and you’re ready to change it.
Cropping
If your map file has more than just your map (such as unrelated windows,
icons, or dialog boxes), one of the first things that you need to do when the
captured screen is loaded in the graphics program is to crop (trim) the image
so only the map is shown.
281
Chapter 17: Saving and Editing Street Maps

Automatic cropping
Automatic cropping is fast and easy if your graphics program has a crop com-
mand. The command automatically removes everything outside of a selected
rectangle, leaving only the image within the rectangle intact.
Manual cropping
If your graphics program doesn’t have a crop command, you can crop a map
manually by copying and pasting what you want. Follow these steps:
1. Use the selection tool to select the map.
2. In the Edit menu, choose the Copy command.
3. Open a new file.
4. In the Edit menu, choose the Paste command to place the map into the
new file.
Using colors and fonts
The colors and fonts that you use in a map can make a big difference in
appearance and readability.
Colors
Colors let a user quickly differentiate features on a map. A black-and-white
map might convey the same information as a color map, but hues and shades
can make a map easier to read.
282
Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 
Pixels for free
Although a number of commercial graphics pro-
grams are on the market, I’m a big fan of free
software. Here are some free graphics programs
I find useful for creating my own maps:
 DrawPlus 4 (simple to use with lots of 
professional features): www.freeserif
software.com/serif/dp/dp4/index.
asp.
 EVE (a very small, vector graphics program
perfect for drawing diagrams and maps):
www.goosee.com.
 OpenOffice-Draw (part of the OpenOffice
suite, which means you also get a word
processor, spreadsheet, and presentation
software in addition to a graphics program):
www.openoffice.org.
 Zoner Draw 3 (fast with support for lots of
graphics file types): www.zoner.com/
draw3/default.asp.
All these programs are more powerful than
Paint, and have object-oriented (vector) draw-
ing capabilities. Plus, you can’t beat the price.

Here are some of the most important rules when it comes to dealing with color:
 Use the same general color scheme as the Web map you’re editing.
Any text or features that you add to the map should be the same color
as the text and features shown on the Web map.
 Use contrast between background and text.
• On a light background, use dark text. Black text is usually best.
• On a dark background, use light text.
 Use bright colors to draw attention to a feature such as a location or
route of travel.
Use red to identify a location the user is searching for.
Fonts
Text labels play an important role in maps; here are some well-founded guide-
lines for using fonts and typeface styles with maps. These tips will make your
digital maps easy on the eyes:
 When adding new labels, use the same typeface as Web map text 
(or as close to the typeface as possible).
 Feature names should be in a normal typeface. Don’t bold or 
italicize them.
 Feature names should only have the first letter capitalized.
Capitalizing an entire name on a map makes it harder to read.
 Text in a straight line is easier to read and find than curved text 
(such as a street name that curves around a corner).
 Sans serif fonts are easier to scan on a computer screen.
You’re reading a serif font right now. Sans serif fonts, such as Arial, 
have letters without serifs (small lines on the top and bottom of some
characters).
If you must use a serif font, Georgia is more legible than Times New
Roman.
 Don’t mix fonts and font size when labeling map features unless you
have a really good reason.
Adding symbols
Symbols convey information without using words. For example, a tent means
a campground, a skier indicates a ski trail, and an airplane means an airport.
283
Chapter 17: Saving and Editing Street Maps

Most Web maps don’t show many symbols. Adding your own symbols is a
quick and easy way to improve a map’s readability. For example, if you 
make a map where the route passes a restaurant, you can add the usual
round plate with a knife and fork in the center to show the restaurant on 
the map.
If you’re adding a symbol to a map, make sure that users will understand
what it means. You may think a picnic table clearly represents a park, but
someone else may have no idea what the symbol is and wonder why there
was a smudged blob on the map.
Finding symbols
Here are two ways you can get symbols for a map:
 Create your own. Making your own symbol involves using your graphics
program to design a small, icon-sized image.
If you’re not artistically inclined, this will result in something that looks
like a smudged blob.
 Use a symbol from a font. Many fonts contain symbols that you can use
on your map. Some fonts are composed solely of mapping symbols. Using
a font symbol is quick and easy, and you don’t need a graphics art degree
to make one.
A number of fonts that contain map symbols are freely available on the
Internet. Here are two Web sources that I turn to when I’m looking for
symbols to include on a map:
• Luc Devroye’s Map/Travel dingbats Web site has a large number of
links to symbol fonts suitable for maps. Go to http://cgm.cs.
mcgill.ca/~luc/travel.html.
• Mapsymbols.com contains a number of symbols formatted for use
with the commercial ArcInfo and ArcView Geographic Information
System (GIS) programs. A number of symbol fonts are also listed.
Check out www.mapsymbols.com/symbols2.html.
Commercial GIS software companies offer free programs that can view GIS
files created by their full-featured programs. Many of these programs install a
collection of symbol fonts into the Windows Font folder. (Some demonstra-
tion versions of mapping programs do this, too.) Even though you might not
use the viewer or demo program, sometimes it’s worthwhile installing just 
to use the fonts.
284
Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 

Inserting symbols
Follow these steps to add a symbol from a font to a map in your graphics 
program:
1. Install the symbol font.
This process depends on your Windows version. Your Windows online
Help system or user guide has instructions for installing fonts.
2. Run the Character Map program by following one of these two steps:
• Choose Start➪Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪
Character Map.
• Choose Start➪Run, and then type charmap in the Run dialog box.
3. Select the font you want from the Font drop-down list.
4. Click the symbol you want to use.
5. Click the Select button; then click the Copy button to copy the symbol
to the Clipboard.
Figure 17-2 shows the Character Map user interface.
6. Select the text tool in your graphics program.
7. Move the cursor to where you want the symbol to appear and then
click.
8. Paste the symbol from the Clipboard into the map.
Figure 17-2:
Use

285
Chapter 17: Saving and Editing Street Maps

Moving symbols
If you want to move the symbol after you’ve placed it, follow these steps:
1. Click the graphics program’s selection tool.
2. Select the symbol.
3. Drag the symbol to a new location on the map.
Selecting the right file format
When the map is exactly how you want it, the last step is to save the file. It’s
important to select the file format that best suits your needs.
If you’re sending a map to someone as an e-mail attachment or posting it on a
Web page, be considerate of those who will view the map. Keep the file size as
small as possible while making the map retain enough detail to be easily read.
A map on a Web site should take less than ten seconds to download over a
dialup Internet connection — that means roughly less than a 70K graphics file.
BMP
A bitmap (BMP) file is a bit-for-bit representation of how an image appears on
a computer monitor. Bitmap files can contain millions of colors.
Don’t save your map as a bitmap file if you’re using it in e-mail or placing it on
a Web site. Files in this format tend to be pretty large because images aren’t
compressed.
286
Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 
Missing Character Map?
If Character Map doesn’t show up in the System
Tools menu, choose Start➪Select Programs and
Accessories; some versions of Windows store
the command here instead of in System Tools. If
you still can’t find the program, you need to
install it. This is easy and usually doesn’t require
inserting any floppy disks or CDs. Follow these
steps to install Character Map:
1. Choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel.
2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs
icon.
3. Click the Windows Setup tab and enable
either the System Tools or the Accessories
option, depending on your Windows version.
4. Click the Details button.
5. Enable the Character Map option.
6. Click Apply.

JPG
A JPG (or JPEG; pronounced JAY-peg) file is designed for saving photographs
and other complex images. JPG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group,
the people who came up with this file format.
It supports millions of colors. JPG images are compressed, so they’re smaller
than BMP files. The JPG format should be used for photographic quality images
where most pixels are different colors.
GIF
GIF (pronounced jif or gif) should be your first file format choice for saving
your edited maps.
GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. GIF files are compressed but are
limited to a palette of 256 colors. This format is widely used for Web maps or
any image that has large regions of the same color.
PNG
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is designed to support millions of colors for
Internet use. It’s slowly replacing the GIF format. Because it produces relatively
small files, you should consider using it for maps that will be sent in e-mail or
associated with a Web site.

Successfully designing maps that are displayed on a Web site isn’t just a matter of randomly select-
ing fonts, colors, and lines and combining them.
If you’re serious about creating maps for the Web, check out these three excellent resources:

Navigating Web Road Maps
In This Chapter
 Exploring street map Web sites
 Reviewing common features
 Choosing between Web and PC street maps
 Taking a tour of street map Web sites
A
s surprising as it sounds, the Internet has actually made a big difference in
helping people in cars not get lost. Free Web services that provide street
maps and driving directions consistently generate some of the highest amounts
of ’Net traffic. As an example, at the end of 2003, the popular MapQuest Web
site produced over 10 million maps and sets of driving directions per day with
30 million visitors each month. That’s a lot of maps and a lot of people who are
looking for maps.
In this chapter, I explore the world of online street maps. Here you discover the
basic features that street map Web sites offer, some advantages and disadvan-
tages to using the services, and some popular street map Web sites in action.
If you’ve never used a street map Web site before, use this chapter to get on
the road using them. And even if you’re a veteran online map user, you’ll
probably discover some tips as well as other street map sites you might not
have known.
Using Street Map Web Sites
A street map Web site is simply an easy-to-use front end to a large database that
contains location and map information. When you visit a site and want to view
a map associated with a specific street address, the server retrieves the appro-
priate data from a database and displays a map in your Web browser. You can
then scroll and zoom in and out on the map to change views and also get other
information (such as driving directions) by using your keyboard or mouse.

Map sites use geocoding to locate addresses, which means that latitude and
longitude coordinates are assigned a street address. These coordinates are
then passed to the map database to retrieve a map or driving directions.
Listing common street 
map Web site features
You can find quite a few street map Web sites on the Internet, and they gener-
ally all have the same features in common, including
 Map display: Obviously, street map sites have street maps. Streets and
roads are displayed in vector maps (created with lines and shapes)
instead of raster maps (scanned versions of paper maps). Vector maps
are faster and efficient to display. You can zoom in and out on the maps
to view them in different scales.
 Address searches: To display a map, you enter a street address, city,
state, or ZIP code. The map Web site checks the location information
that you entered to see whether it’s valid; if it is, the map is displayed.
 Route creation: In addition to showing a map of a single location, street
map Web sites can also create routes that show you how to get from
Point A to Point B. Just enter a starting and ending address, and the Web
site will display a map of how to get to your destination.
 Route directions: Street map Web sites also can provide you with dri-
ving directions for getting to a location. The directions list streets, turns,
and estimated times and distances for traveling between different parts
of the route.
 Printing: All street map Web sites can output maps and driving direc-
tions to your printer, which is usually easier than lugging your PC with
you on a trip.
Street map Web site companies usually don’t make their own maps but rely
on map data licensed from one or more third-party map companies such as
Geographic Data Technology (GDT), NAVTECH, and TeleAtlas. Although map
Web sites might use the same data, their maps can look different depending
on how they display and use the data.
Web versus PC software street maps
If you’ve read Chapter 12 (all about PC street-navigation programs), you
might be wondering whether you should use a Web-hosted street map or a
program that comes bundled with a street map CD-ROM. Both can find
addresses, display street maps, and create routes. To answer your question,
look at the advantages and disadvantages to using street map Web sites com-
pared with their PC program cousins.

Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 

Street map Web site advantages
Some of the advantages that street map Web sites offer are that they’re
 Free: Street map Web sites are one of those valuable resources that you
can still get for free on the Internet. The companies that host these map
sites stay in business by selling advertising, offering other mapping
products and services to corporate customers, or charging for premium
services.
 Easy to use: Street map Web sites are very simple to use. They offer
basic mapping features and easy-to-understand user interfaces.
 Available almost anywhere: If you have an Internet connection and a
Web browser, you can find street addresses and create maps from just
about anywhere you can access the ’Net.
 More frequently updated: One of the big selling points to maps on Web
sites is they can be updated more frequently than maps that come with
PC software; which tend to be updated annually. (However, I’ve yet to
see a map site provide details on how often and which maps have been
updated.)
Street map Web site disadvantages
Some of the drawbacks to using street map Web sites include
 Limited POIs: PC street map software packages have a large number of
Points of Interests (POIs) on maps such as gas stations, restaurants, and
other businesses and services. Most street map Web sites don’t show

Chapter 18: Navigating Web Road Maps
Map accuracy
On Christmas Day, 1998, a German driver out for
a spin in a GPS-equipped BMW drove his car
into a river as he dutifully followed the direc-
tions of his in-car navigation system. Despite
the stop signs, he continued down a ferry ramp
and drove into the Havel River, slowly sinking in
about 12 feet of water. Fortunately, the driver
and his passenger were not injured. The digital
map displayed in his dashboard showed a
bridge when it actually should have been
marked as a ferry crossing — and the driver
trusted his BMW more than his common sense.
This is a rather extreme case, but it does illus-
trate an important point: Street maps will
always have some errors in them, and you can’t
expect 100 percent accuracy. Software compa-
nies, Web sites, and map data vendors do try
their best to keep maps current and up-to-date.
(Most map Web sites even have ways to report
errors in maps and driving directions.) However,
when you consider the 3.95+ million miles of
public roads in the United States — with con-
stant, ongoing construction — keeping maps
accurate can be a daunting challenge. So try
not to get too frustrated if a map Web site occa-
sionally makes a boo-boo. And watch out for
ferry crossings.

POIs or only display a limited number, such as selected hotels or other
advertisement-based services
 Limited route capabilities: Many street map Web sites can create routes
only between two locations. PC map programs allow you to build routes
with multiple legs, change routes on-the-fly while you’re driving, and
specify locations to travel through on your way to a destination.
 No trip-planning features: PC street map programs support calculating
trip costs, determining gas stops, setting typical driving speeds, and
other advanced trip-planning features. Map Web sites don’t have all
these options.
 No customization options: Unlike PC map software, street map Web
sites don’t have drawing tools for customizing maps with added text or
symbols.
If you want to add text or symbols to a map created with a Web site,
you’ll need to apply some of the techniques that I describe in Chapter 17
and use a graphics program to edit your map.
 Lack of GPS compatibility: Unlike a laptop or PDA that’s running street-
navigation software and is connected to a GPS receiver, Web sites don’t
provide you with real-time GPS tracking capabilities.
 Advertisements: If you use a street map Web site, be prepared for lots of
ads. Although the ads pay for the mapping service (which allows the
service to continue to be free to you), ads can take up to two-thirds of
the screen, leaving only a small portion available to display a map.
Choosing between Web-hosted and PC software street maps
If you can’t make up your mind whether to use Web-hosted or PC software
street maps, here are few guidelines:
 Infrequent use: If you need to look up an address only every now and
then and periodically plan trips, you’ll probably be served perfectly well
using a street map Web site.
 Frequent use: If you travel quite a bit, you’ll likely want the additional
features that I mention earlier in this chapter that are found in PC street-
navigation programs. The enhanced features make life easier for the fre-
quent traveler.
 Customizable: If you want to customize your maps such as adding text
labels to them, PC map software offers many more features and options
for creating custom maps.
 Speed: Even if you have PC map software, street map Web sites can be
faster to use if you need to quickly look up a street address, especially if
you have a broadband Internet connection.

Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 

Reviewing Street Map Web Sites
In this part of the chapter, I review several popular street map Web sites, talk
about their features, and show what their maps look like.
Map companies are always trying to improve the usability of their maps. You
might find some differences in the appearance of the maps that you see dis-
played on a Web site and the ones in this chapter.
To start with, all street map Web sites work the same when it comes to dis-
playing maps and driving directions. Their user interfaces might be slightly
different, but if you’re familiar with using one street map Web site, you’ll be
able to easily use others. By mastering these basic skills, using just about any
street map Web site should be a snap:
 To display a map for a specific location, you enter an address, city,
state (or country), and optional ZIP (or postal) code and then click a
search button. See an example of the MapQuest address search page in
Figure 18-1.
Figure 18-1:
MapQuest
address
search
page.
293
Chapter 18: Navigating Web Road Maps

You can also just enter a city and state or a ZIP code to display an
overview map of an area.
 To display a driving route between two points, either in the form of a
map or turn-by-turn directions, you click a directions button or link, and
then enter the address, city, state (or country), and optional ZIP (or
postal) code for the starting point and destination. As an example, the
MapQuest driving directions search page is shown in Figure 18-2.
After a map is displayed, you can zoom in and out to show more detail or 
a larger area, respectively. Most maps feature a zoom scale with a series of
boxes with a plus and minus sign at each end. Clicking a box nearer to the
plus sign zooms in, and clicking a box closer to the minus sign zooms out.
You can move around the map by clicking arrows or compass points that
border the map; the map scrolls in the direction of the arrow or compass point.
All map Web sites provide an online help link. Even if you’ve used a street
map Web site for a while, it’s worth your time to read the help information.
There’s a good chance that you’ll discover something new that might save
you some time.
Take a quick look at some street map Web sites.

MapQuest
MapQuest (www.mapquest.com) is the largest and most popular map Web
site on the Internet and provides street maps of North America and Europe.
(You can also view less-detailed, worldwide, city, and country maps.) The site
was first launched in 1996, and its corporate roots extend back to the 1960s,
when its original parent company started making paper road maps that were
distributed by gas stations. America Online currently owns MapQuest, and
the site generates millions of maps each day and consistently ranks in top ten
of the most-popular Web site lists.
After you search for an address and display a map, as shown in Figure 18-3,
you can print it, e-mail the map as an attachment, or download it to a PDA
that’s running AvantGo (www.avantgo.com) software.
MapQuest can provide specially formatted maps and driving directions for
wireless PDAs and cellphones with Internet connectivity. Check out the link
to Mobile MapQuest (look for Mobile) on the MapQuest home page for infor-
mation on using different types of wireless devices.
Like all street map sites, MapQuest provides route maps (an example is shown
in Figure 18-4) and driving directions. In addition to addresses, you can also
search for businesses by name or type even if you don’t know their address.

Rand McNally
Rand McNally (www.randmcnally.com), in the map business since 1856, now
produces both paper and electronic street maps for the United States. Its
Web site offers some of the cleanest, easiest-to-read online maps that are
available on the Internet; an example is shown in Figure 18-5. If you’re used to
maps with jagged lines that look computer-generated, the second-generation
digital maps that Rand McNally produces will pleasantly surprise you.
After you display a map, you can change its size, print it, e-mail it, or save it
online if you’ve previously registered with a free or paid Road Explorers
membership.
In addition to standard route mapping capabilities, Rand McNally has options
such as selecting fastest or shortest routes, whether to use a greater or
lesser number of route steps, and displaying driving directions in several dif-
ferent formats. (A simple route map is shown in Figure 18-6.) The site is also
one of the best places on the Web for planning vacation road trips. Rand
McNally has taken a large amount of content from its popular paper travel
guides and put it online to help you find attractions and activities on your
trips. The only major issue that I’ve found with this site is its servers seem to
get bogged down every now and then, tending to be slower displaying maps
and generating routes compared with other sites.

Maporama
When I’m going to travel outside the United States, one of my first stops is
Maporama (www.maporama.com), the French company that maintains a free
street map Web site to showcase its mapping products and services. At
Maporama, you can look up street maps from all over the world. The level of
detail varies depending on how industrialized a country is; for example, you
get better maps for Switzerland than you will for Swaziland.
Street maps such as the one displayed in Figure 18-7, can be printed, e-mailed,
or downloaded to a PDA. Maporama is one of the few mapping sites that lets
you select exactly what size to display the map and what colors you want the
map shown in. For example, a grayscale color style is available for using maps
on monochrome screen PDAs.
If you ever need latitude and longitude coordinates for an address,
Maporama displays the coordinates (beneath the map) of an address you’ve
searched for. The latitude and longitude might not be as precise as standing
outside the location with a GPS receiver in hand, but they’ll be close.
Figure 18-7:
A

298
Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 

Maporama also displays routes and driving directions, but I find that the
route maps often don’t show as much detail as route maps created by other
Web sites. (A sample map is shown in Figure 18-8.) Detailed turn-by-turn
directions are displayed below the route map, though, steering you in the
right direction to reach your destination. Maporama also has some nice fea-
tures usually not found on map sites such as
 You can select routes depending on your mode of transportation: by car,
foot, or foot and subway (more suited for Europe than the U.S.).
 Zoomed-in maps show numbered address ranges on street blocks.
 Symbols show transportation and other points of interest.

 Reviewing commercial topographic map Web sites
W
eb-hosted street maps are handy for finding your way around in cities,
but what if your travels take you off-road, on less-beaten paths in
forests, mountains, and deserts? You’re in luck because a number of Web
sites provide free or inexpensive topographic maps of the United States that
you can view, print, and take with you on your next adventure.
In this chapter, I discuss some of the differences between topographic maps
offered on the Web and dedicated topographic mapping programs that run
on your computer. I also present some popular topographic map Web sites
as well as basic instructions on using them to display maps.
Using Web-hosted Topographic Maps
Web-hosted topographic sites are fast and easy to use. If you’ve already read
Chapter 13 (which covers topographic map software for PCs), you might be
wondering whether you should buy a mapping program or rely on free or low-
cost Web map services. Look at some of the advantages and disadvantages to
using topographic map Web sites.
Advantages of topographic Web sites
Topographic map Web sites are pretty handy. Just visit a Web site and voilà! —
instant map. These maps have several advantages:
 Available anywhere: If you can access a computer with an Internet 
connection — say at home, the office, a library, or an Internet café —
topographic maps are but a few mouse clicks away.

 Easy to use: If you’re intimidated by the many options and commands in
most PC mapping software products, Web-hosted map sites usually have
a basic set of features and commands that are easy to master and use.
 Inexpensive: If you’re on a budget, these Web sites are either free or
charge nominal subscription fees to access their maps.
Disadvantages of topographic Web sites
Web-based topographic mapping sites have a few limitations:
 Small map size: Most sites display only relatively small-sized (onscreen,
that is) maps.
 Internet accessibility issues: Sometimes you might not have access to
an Internet connection, the mapping Web site could be down, or your
Internet connection could be very slow.
 Time investment: Saving a Web-displayed map (whether you’re using
screenshots and other techniques described in Chapter 17 or download-
ing a map from a commercial service) can be a time-consuming process.
 No advanced features: Most topographic map Web sites don’t have such
advanced features as interfacing with a GPS receiver, the ability to change
map datums or display terrain three-dimensionally, or options for cus-
tomizing maps. These features are common in PC mapping programs.
A number of these limitations are addressed by commercial map Web sites
that I describe later in the “Commercial topographic Web map sites” section.
Deciding between Web-based 
maps and mapping programs
Here are my recommendations as to whether you should use Web-based
topographic maps or topographic mapping programs:
 Infrequent use: If you just want to print out a topographic map every
now and then, a free Web-hosted map site probably meets your needs.
 Frequent or sophisticated use: If you use topographic maps often, want to
create custom maps, or interface your GPS with a digital topographic map,
you’re better off with one of the map programs described in Chapter 13
or trying a commercial Web site that offers topographic maps.
 Quickies: Even if you regularly use PC mapping software, topographic
map Web sites are great for quickly creating or viewing maps.
302
Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 

Reviewing Topographic Map Web Sites
Here are some of the Web sites that you can visit to access topographic maps
of the United States. I cover both free and commercial sites and discuss some
of their basic features. If you’re near a computer with an Internet connection,
you can follow along as I step through some examples on how to display and
use topographic maps on several free Web sites.
Web sites come and go, and user interfaces and site features change.
Using Maptech MapServer
Maptech (http://maptech.com) is a map and navigation software company
that produces topographic, nautical, and aviation mapping products. (I dis-
cuss its Terrain Navigator software in Chapter 13.)
To showcase its map technology and sell products, Maptech hosts MapServer,
the free Web service database that contains maps and the names of cities,
lakes, mountains, and other features. You can visit MapServer by pointing
your Web browser to http://mapserver.maptech.com.
Displaying MapServer maps
MapServer can’t read your mind to know what map you want to look at, so you
first enter some search information in the upper-left corner of the MapServer
Web page. For example, suppose you’re interested in looking at a map of 
the city of Bar Harbor, Maine. (Try the lobster ice cream if you’re ever in the
neighborhood.) To display the map, follow these steps:
1. Enter Bar Harbor in the Enter City or Place Name text box.
You can also enter the ZIP code of a location (and click its Go! button) or
click the Advanced Search button to find a map by either its name or its
latitude and longitude coordinates.
2. Choose Maine from the Select State drop-down list box.
3. Click the Go! button.
A list of places matching the place that you entered is displayed. In this
case, I get 24 matches for Bar Harbor (as shown in Figure 19-1). Click the
first entry for a map of the city of Bar Harbor. You know that’s the right
one because it’s identified as a Populated Place (under the Type heading).
303
Chapter 19: Exploring Web Topographic Maps

MapServer provides you with a bonus: You can also view several other types
of maps. These map types appear above the map as tabs, as shown in Figure
19-2, and include
 Topo Map: A United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic map
of the area
 Nautical Chart: A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) nautical chart of the area (if navigable waterways are nearby)
 Aeronautical Chart: A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aeronauti-
cal chart of the area for use by pilots
 Nav Photo: An aerial photo of the area
The topographic map is displayed by default; change the display to another
type of map by clicking one of the tabs. If the Nautical Chart or Nav Photo tab
items are dimmed, those types of charts aren’t available for viewing.
You can print the currently displayed map by choosing Print MY MAPS from
the FUN TOOLS drop-down list box (lower-left corner of the screen, under
Coordinates).

Moving around in a MapServer map
After a map is displayed, you can move around in it via
 Direction arrows: A series of eight red triangles surround the map. Click
them to scroll the map in the direction they point.
 Clicking: Clicking inside the map centers the map on the location that
you click.
Viewing coordinates in a MapServer map
As you move the cursor over the map, the coordinates of the location under-
neath the cursor appear to the left of the map, telling you exactly where you’re
located. This can be handy for finding the coordinates of a location to manually
enter as a waypoint in your GPS receiver. From the menu of the Coordinates
drop-down list box, you can display map coordinates in several different 
formats:
 DMS/DM.MM/DD.DD: Latitude and longitude (degrees, minutes, sec-
onds, or degrees and decimal minutes or decimal degrees)
 UTM: Universal Transverse Mercator
For the lowdown on latitude, longitude, and UTM, see Chapter 2.
Figure 19-2:
MapServer
offers topo-
graphic and
other map
options.
305
Chapter 19: Exploring Web Topographic Maps

MapServer displays all map coordinates using the NAD 27 map datum. If you
don’t know (or remember) what datums are, head to Chapter 4 to read why
they are important when you’re using a GPS receiver.
Changing a MapServer map size
You can change the size and appearance of a MapServer map three ways:
 Click To Zoom: Underneath the map are a series of bars between icons
of two magnifying glasses: one with a plus sign and the other with a
minus sign. Click one of the bars to zoom in or out on the map. The bars
closest to the plus magnifying glass zoom in, and the bars closest to the
minus magnifying glass zoom out.
 Scale: The Scale drop-down list box allows you to change the scale of the
map. For example, a topographic map can be viewed at 1:24,000, 1:50,000,
1:100,000, or 1:250,000 scale. The larger the number to the right of the
colon, the less detail there is and the more area shown. A 1:100,000 scale
map is shown in Figure 19-3.
 Zoom: Use the Zoom drop-down list box to change the size of the map,
either showing it at 100% or reducing its size to 50% of normal. Select
the size from the drop-down list box and click the Go! button. Figure 19-3
shows the same map at 50% as in Figure 19-2 at 100%.

Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 

Using MyMaps
MapServer has a unique feature — MyMaps — that lets you create and save
custom maps. After you create a map, you can refer to it for future reference,
e-mail it to friends, or add a link to the map on a Web site.
The MapServer Web site has a comprehensive tutorial for using MyMaps, but
read along as I show you quickly how to create a custom map. Display the
map you want to customize and follow these steps:
1. From the FUN TOOLS drop-down list box, choose Place an Icon.
This launches the MyMaps Wizard, which steps you through the process
of building a custom map.
2. When the map in the wizard is the one you want, click NEXT.
3. Click a point on the map that you want to label with an icon.
A blue arrow pointing to that location appears.
4. Click NEXT.
5. Choose the type of symbol you want to associate with the location
from the list of symbol categories; then click NEXT.
For example, if the location is for transportation, choose Transportation.
A list of icons appears for the selected symbol type. If you choose
Transportation, icons of cars, planes, and other vehicles are displayed.
6. Click the icon you want to use and then click NEXT.
7. Enter a name to associate with the location; then click the Preview
Name button to see the map. If you’re satisfied, click NEXT.
8. Decide whether to associate a Web site with the location:
• If you want someone to click the map location to visit a specified
Web site, enter a Web site address.
• If you don’t want a Web site link, click NEXT to continue.
9. Click the SAVE TO MYMAPS button to save your map.
A new drop-down list box named MYMAPS is added to the MapServer Web
page below the search boxes in the upper-right corner of the window.
 A list of all the maps that you’ve created appears in the list box. Choosing
a map and clicking the Go! button displays the map.
 A Manage MYMAPS item in the drop-down list lets you delete a map or
change its name.
307
Chapter 19: Exploring Web Topographic Maps

MyMaps stores information about the map you’ve created as a Web browser
cookie. Whenever you visit the MapServer Web site, it checks for map cookies
and then displays the titles of any maps you’ve created in the MYMAPS drop-
down list. Cookies apply only to the computer you used to create the maps; if
you access MapServer from another computer, your MyMaps won’t appear.
Maptech offers free registration on its Web site so you can log in to MapServer
from any computer and have your MyMaps available.
Using GPS Visualizer
GPS Visualizer is a slick, easy-to-use Web-based mapping program, written by
Adam Schneider, that allows you to upload GPS waypoints and track files to a
Web site and then overlay them on topographic and other types maps.
GPS Visualizer relies on online sources that provide free topographic maps,
aerial photos, satellite images, and street maps. Unlike many other sites that
are limited to making maps of the United States, GPS Visualizer can create
maps of Canada, Europe, and other places in the world.
GPS Visualizer has a number of powerful options for creating customized
maps. In this section, I describe how to make a map using some of the Web
site’s basic features. After you master the general procedure, you can experi-
ment on your own with some of the other advanced options.
If you’d like to follow my examples, point your Web browser to www.
gpsvisualizer.com. GPS Visualizer is free, but if you find it useful, the
author requests a small PayPal donation as a way of saying thanks.
Before you can use GPS Visualizer to display maps, you need to install the
free Adobe SVG Viewer plug-in to work with your Web browser. If you don’t
already have the plug-in, you can download the viewer at www.adobe.com/
svg/viewer/install.
Downloading sample GPS Visualizer data
To demonstrate how GPS Visualizer works, I use sample GPS data available
from the GPS Visualizer Web site — in this case, a GPS record of a drive down
the California coast through the scenic artichoke fields. To download the data,
follow these steps:
1. Click the Draw a map link on the GPS Visualizer home page.
2. Right-click and choose Save As (or Save Target As, depending on your
Web browser). Click the GPX file from California link to save the
sample_calif.gpx file to your hard drive.
308
Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 

You can input a number of different GPS data formats into GPS Visualizer,
including GPX (a standardized format for inputting and outputting GPS data)
and OziExplorer waypoint and track files, Geocaching.com LOC files, and tab-
delimited text files. (Read about OziExplorer in Chapter 15; read about the
sport of geocaching in Chapter 7.)
Displaying a GPS Visualizer map
After you have some sample GPS data to use, create a map with it. The GPS
Visualizer map input form page, as shown in Figure 19-4, might seem a little
intimidating with all its different options. To get started making maps, you
can leave most of the default settings as they are. (If you’re feeling a bit over-
whelmed, click the simple version of the map form link to display just the
basic input options.)
Each option has a question mark button to the right of it that you can click 
to display a window with more information about that option and how to 
use it.
Figure 19-4:

309
Chapter 19: Exploring Web Topographic Maps

To display a map, you tell GPS Visualizer what GPS data you plan on using:
1. Click the Browse button next to the File #1 text box and choose the
location of the sample_calif.gpx file.
See preceding step list.
2. From the Background map drop-down list box, choose US: USGS Topo
Map, Single Image.
While you’re there, check out the other background map options.
3. Select the Open in New Window check box (lower left of the screen).
4. Click the Draw the Map button (lower left of the screen).
A new window shows a map with the GPS data overlaid on it (as shown
in Figure 19-5). Some of the features displayed on the map include
• Waypoints: Any GPS waypoints that were included with the uploaded
data are plotted on the map, identified by a circle and the waypoint
name. When you move the cursor over a waypoint label, the way-
point name changes color so it’s easier to see. You can also click and
drag a waypoint label to move it. When you do, a line is drawn from
the waypoint label to actual waypoint location. This is useful if the
waypoint label obscures something you want to see on the map.
• Tracks: The GPS track data showing the travel route is drawn on the
map. By default, GPS Visualizer shows the elevation for different
segments of the track path in different colors; note the legend at the

TerraSever-USA
TerraServer-USA is a popular Web site that provides free USGS topographic
maps and aerial photos of the United States. (Chapter 20 contains an extensive
description of the site and detailed instructions to display aerial photos.)
Nearly all the commands used for viewing aerial photos also apply to display-
ing topographic maps. Visit the Web site www.terraserver-usa.com.

Commercial topographic Web map sites
Several commercial Web sites sell digital topographic maps as well as allow
potential customers to view some of their maps for free (to get a hint of what
their for-fee services are like). All these sites tend to have a similar business
model, offering
 Printed maps: You can buy printed copies of maps you view online.
 Subscriptions: On some sites, you can view only certain types of free
maps; to access other maps, you pay a subscription fee. Additionally,
some sites offer different levels of services. For example, for an extra fee,
you might get premium services, such as
• Downloading maps you can use with PC map programs
• Creating custom maps
• Uploading GPS data to use with Web-based maps
The cost of subscription services tends to be comparable or less than the
prices of commercial mapping programs that you run on your PC.

Chapter 19: Exploring Web Topographic Maps

When it comes to commercial topographic map Web sites, you’re paying for
convenience in accessing and using the maps online as well as having a
number of different types of maps available in a single place. Although some
of the same services are available for free elsewhere on the Internet, commer-
cial map Web sites are priced reasonably enough that you can try them to
see whether they meet your needs.
These popular commercial map sites, along with some screenshots, give you
an idea of what it’s like to use the online maps with your browser.
TopoZone
TopoZone, the first interactive Web mapping site on the Internet, provides a
comprehensive collection of digital topographic maps and aerial photos for
the United States. Any Internet user can freely search for and view USGS
topographic maps; a screenshot of accessing a map with TopoZone is shown
in Figure 19-6. For a yearly subscription fee of under $50, the TopoZone Pro
service offers access to aerial photos, street maps, downloading USGS Digital
Raster Graphics map, and other enhanced features. To read more about
TopoZone, go to www.topozone.com.

MapCard
MapCard is a commercial Web map site oriented toward outdoor recreation
users; the site was named the best new product of 2003 by Backpacker
Magazine. The Web site offers topographic maps, aerial photos, lake depth
charts for fishing, and tools for creating custom maps; Figure 19-7 shows a
screenshot of a map displayed with MapCard. Although MapCard doesn’t
directly offer free online maps (a yearly subscription is under $30), the site
does have a free “test drive” with which you can download maps and try out
the subscription services for a single day. You can visit MapCard at www.
mapcard.com.
MyTopo
MyTopo is a commercial Web site for creating custom USGS topographic
maps or aerial photos; a screenshot of using the site is shown in Figure 19-8.
You select a location you want to view (either by place name or coordinates),
and MyTopo displays the map or photo. You customize the map by setting its
size, selecting a portion of the map to display, and naming the map. A preview
copy of the map as it will be printed is displayed. You can then order a copy
of the map in several different sizes on waterproof or glossy paper.

A
lthough many Internet users know about street mapping Web sites like
MapQuest (see Chapter 18), fewer people are aware of Web sites that
provide free aerial photos (taken from aircraft) and satellite data. These
images complement traditional maps, displaying features that don’t show up
on topographic or street maps, such as vegetation and unmarked roads or
trails. In addition, aerial photos and satellite images are often more up-to-date
than topographic maps and provide more timely and accurate information.
In this chapter, I present several popular Web sites that you can visit to view
aerial photos and satellite images; I also describe the basics of using three of
my favorite aerial photo and satellite services.
I treat both aerial photos and satellite images as simply graphics images in
this chapter because that’s how you view them on the Web. Unless there’s a
need to specifically differentiate between an aerial photo and a satellite
image, the word image in this chapter refers to both.
Using Web Aerial and Satellite Images
One of the biggest advantages to using an image captured from an airplane or
satellite is that it shows reality — not a cartographer’s representation drawn
on a map. You can use aerial and satellite images to
 Complement a topographic map to help determine your current 
location.
 Find roads and trails not shown on maps.

 Better understand how thick tree and brush cover will be in an area
you plan to visit.
Don’t rely solely on these images for navigation. Aerial and satellite
images typically don’t have natural or man-made features labeled or
show elevation contours.
 View neighborhoods in urban areas.
 Augment marketing endeavors, Web sites, or presentations. Aerial
photos are always attention-getters.
The two types of aerial photos and satellite images available on the Web are
 Government: Governments use aircraft and satellites to map land for
administrative and research purposes. Some maps are for intelligence
gathering, but these images usually aren’t available to the public. Most
government-produced images are usually free on the Internet. Keep in
mind that many governments aren’t as liberal as the United States in dis-
tributing images because of national security reasons.
 Commercial: A number of businesses specialize in taking aerial pho-
tographs or reselling photos and satellite images from other vendors.
Some of these companies let users browse their Web sites freely for
reduced-scale or watermarked images (images with an overlaid logo or
text that might obscure detail), selling printed, full-size, unwatermarked
versions of these images.
You can download free or commercial aerial photos for mapping programs
(such as some of the programs I discuss in Chapter 14), but Web-hosted
aerial and satellite image services work well for a quick look at an area you’re
interested in. Some advantages to using Web-hosted image services include
 No need to have special software installed on a PC to view the images.
(All you need is a Web browser.)
Some Web sites might require you to use a specific Web browser. For
example, to access GlobeXplorer images, you need to use Internet
Explorer.
 Access of images from any computer connected to the Internet.
 Simplified user interfaces of the Web pages that make viewing the
images easy.
To save and edit free aerial and satellite images displayed on Web sites, use
the techniques that I discuss in Chapter 17. However, purchasing a down-
loaded image from a commercial site might be quicker and easier.
316
Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 

Don’t expect real-time, spy-satellite accuracy from free Web images. These
images can be over five years old and not show current roads or other fea-
tures. (Image accuracy is better in wilderness, rural, or urban areas that
haven’t experienced a lot of natural or man-made change.)
Reviewing Aerial and Satellite 
Image Web Sites
Most aerial and satellite image Web sites like these have similar features and
user interfaces, so when you figure out how to use one, using another site is
easy. To give you a better idea of image resolution and how the sites work, I
use a series of screenshots from each of these three Web sites to shows aerial
photos of downtown Seattle, Washington. (If you look really, really, close, you
can probably find a Starbuck’s or two.) I personally like these Web sites
because they offer a variety of free or reasonably priced images.
The data on each of these Web sites has strengths and weaknesses. Some dis-
play free, high-resolution color images with corporate watermarks as well as
lower-resolution color images with no watermarks. When I’m looking for
aerial or satellite images, I generally visit all three to find an image that meets
my needs and budget.
The availability of aerial and satellite images on the Web can change. For exam-
ple, MapQuest (the popular street map Web site) used to display street maps
and aerial photos provided by GlobeXplorer, but the aerial photo service was
discontinued in December 2003. Microsoft’s TerraServer project stopped offer-
ing satellite imagery for locations all over the globe in 2000. Serving up images

Airplane or satellite?
You might think that the photos displayed on
TerraServer-USA and other Web-hosted map-
ping sites come from satellites, but these photos
are actually taken from airplanes flying at pre-
cise altitudes (up to 25,000 feet) with specially
mounted cameras. Images that come from satel-
lites (or the Space Shuttle) can be photos, but
they can also be composite images put together
from data that comes from sensors that detect
differences in moisture, vegetation, or terrain.
In general, satellite images don’t show as
much detail as aerial photos. That’s changing; 
commercial services (such as DigitalGlobe’s
QuickBird satellite) can produce high-resolution,
color photos on demand for anywhere in the
world. (See www.digitalglobe.com for
some amazing examples of high-resolution
satellite images.) In general, if you see images
labeled Landsat, SPOT, SPIN-2, or QuickBird,
they came from satellites. Most other images
are photos taken from airplanes.

on the Web costs for bandwidth and storage; what’s free today — 
particularly from commercial sites — might not be around tomorrow.
TerraServer-USA
In 1998, Microsoft, Compaq, the USGS, and several other partners launched the
TerraServer Web site. The site was a technology demonstration for Microsoft
software and Digital (which had recently been purchased by Compaq) hard-
ware and was dubbed “the world’s largest online database.” TerraServer had a
collection of compressed aerial photos and satellite images that took up over a
terabyte (TB) of space. (A terabyte, which is 1,024GB, was a lot of disk space
back then.) Anyone with an Internet connection could freely browse through
the database of images.
Now renamed TerraServer-USA (www.terraserver-usa.com), this site pro-
vides aerial photos and topographic maps supplied by the USGS for just
about anywhere in the United States. Although most of the aerial photos that
TerraServer-USA provides are black-and-white, TerraServer-USA is adding
USGS Urban Areas aerial photography collections of mapping major metro-
politan areas with high-resolution, color aerial photos.
Displaying TerraServer-USA aerial photos
To display an aerial photo from TerraServer-USA, you first enter some search
criteria. You can search for aerial photos three different ways.
Zoom-in searches
When you visit the main page of the TerraServer-USA site at www.
terraserver-usa.com, you’re greeted with a map of the world. Areas dis-
played in green contain map data. Move the cursor to a location that you
want to view and click. Keep clicking and zooming in until the aerial photo
you’re interested is displayed.
General searches
Search for a TerraServer-USA aerial photo of a city or well-known location
from the Search TerraServer text box. When you click the Go button, a list of
the aerial photos that match the text is displayed. Click the text that
describes the image you’re interested in to display it.
You can make your search more specific by entering a city name followed by a
comma, a space, and the standard two-letter postal abbreviation of the state.
For practice, try searching for a well-known landmark, such as the Space
Needle in Seattle, Washington. If you enter Space Needle, you get the aerial
photo of downtown Seattle as shown in Figure 20-1. There’s not much detail,
but you can find out how to increase the resolution in the section titled
“Changing image resolution in TerraServer-USA.”
318
Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 

Specific searches
The most accurate way to search TerraServer-USA for aerial photos is to use
the Advanced Find options:
 Address: Enter a street address for the location that you’d like to view.
The City, State, and ZIP Code fields are optional, but using them helps
narrow down the search.
 Geographic: Enter the latitude and longitude coordinates, either in deci-
mal degrees or degrees, minutes, and seconds.
 Place: Enter a place name and the state (and optionally the country).
You can enter a partial place name; for example, entering San with
California as the state displays all the locations with names beginning
with San, such as San Diego, San Francisco, and even Santa Clara.
After you enter your search criteria, click the Go button, and the aerial
photo is displayed. If several images match your selection criteria, you
can choose the exact photo you’re interested in from a list.
Moving in a TerraServer-USA photo
When you view an aerial map in TerraServer-USA, a frame with arrows sur-
rounds the image (refer to Figure 20-1). Click one of the arrows to pan the
map in that direction. There’s also a compass rose to the left of the image
Figure 20-1:
A Terra-
ServerUSA
aerial
photo of
downtown
Seattle,
Washington.
319
Chapter 20: Overhead Image Web Sites

that works the same way. Click a compass direction to scroll the map; for
example, click E (for east) to scroll the map to the right.
Displaying a TerraServer-USA topographic map
In addition to displaying aerial photos, TerraServer-USA also can show a
USGS topographic map of the same area that the aerial photo displays. (See
Figure 20-2 for a topographic map of the area around the Space Needle.)
 To display a map: From the View drop-down list (to the left of the aerial
photo and above the compass), select Topo Map. A topographic map in
roughly the same scale as the aerial photo is displayed.
 To display an aerial photo: To return to the aerial photo image, select
Aerial Photo from the View drop-down list.
TerraServer-USA is starting to provide high-resolution, color aerial photos of
certain large metropolitan areas in the United States. If these images are avail-
able for the area you’re viewing, Urban Areas will appear in the View drop-
down list. Select Urban Areas in the list to display a color photo.

Changing image resolution in TerraServer-USA
After you display an aerial photo or a map, you can change the resolution.
Resolution, especially when dealing with aerial photos, is expressed in meters
(about a yard for nonmetric types). An aerial photo with 1-meter resolution
means that you can see an object on the ground that’s one square meter in
size. The smaller the resolution number, the more detail the image shows. For
example, Figure 20-3 shows the Space Needle viewed at 1-meter resolution.
Topographic maps can be displayed from 2 to 512 meters in resolution, and
aerial photos can be shown from 1 to 512 meters. If there’s data for an urban
area with high-resolution, color photos, you can go from .25 to 64 meters; 
.25 meters is enough detail to start seeing people on the street, as shown in
Figure 20-4.
A resolution scale is shown immediately below the compass, to the left of the
map or aerial photo. To change the image resolution, you can either
 Click one of the bars between the plus and minus buttons. The farthest
bar on the left provides the least amount of detail and largest area, and
the bar on the extreme right shows the greatest amount of detail and the
smallest area.
 Click the minus button or the plus button. This decreases or increases
resolution one step at a time, respectively.
Figure 20-3:

Needle, in
the center,

321
Chapter 20: Overhead Image Web Sites

The current resolution is displayed above the scale. In addition, the bar rep-
resenting the current resolution is highlighted in a different color.
You can change the screen size of an aerial photo or map with the Map Size
drop-down list that’s shown under the resolution scale. Images can be dis-
played in small, medium, or large sizes.
Getting image information from TerraServer-USA
When you use aerial photos, it’s always important to know when the photo
was taken so you can know how current it is. TerraServer-USA displays the
date the photo was snapped (or the date the map was made) above the image.
You can get more detailed image information by clicking the Info item above
the displayed image. For an aerial photo, the Image Info window provides
additional details such as the image size in pixels, the map projection, and a
grid overlaid on the image showing latitude and longitude coordinates.
Another excellent source of free USGS aerial photos is The National Map Web:
http://nationalmap.usgs.gov. This online map displays aerial images and
other U.S. government maps and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 21.

TerraServer.com
TerraServer.com (not to be confused with TerraServer-USA) is an offshoot of
the original Microsoft TerraServer research project. When the original
TerraServer was launched in 1998, the site offered SPIN-2 satellite imagery
that covered Europe, Asia, and other areas outside the United States. The
satellite data was leased for 18 months; in 2000, Aerial Images (the company
that owned the leased data) decided to launch its own Web site,
TerraServer.com (www.terraserver.com).
TerraServer.com sells aerial photos and satellite images from a number of dif-
ferent image providers. Currently, this site does not offer topographical
maps, although that service is supposed to be on the way. You can freely
view images that have a maximum 8-meter resolution. (An example image of
downtown Seattle in this resolution is shown in Figure 20-5.) With 8-meter
resolution, you can easily see large buildings, but the detail isn’t as great as
the 1-meter (or lower) resolution USGS aerial photos that TerraServer-USA
provides. TerraServer.com does make higher-resolution images available; you
just need to subscribe to the service to be able to view them. (Subscription
fees range from $6.95 for a day’s use to $99.95 for a year.) There are addi-
tional charges for downloading the images or ordering printed copies of
them; depending on the size of the option and whether you want a digital or
printed copy, expect to pay between $5–$80 per image.
323
Chapter 20: Overhead Image Web Sites
Homeland insecurity
In December 2003, some aerial photos of
Washington DC — long available from various
Web sites — changed. Photos of such buildings
as the White House, the Vice President’s 
residence, and the Capitol were altered so 
only blurred pixels appeared instead of sharp
detail. (You can view some of the before and
after photos at http://cryptome.org/
seatsuneyeball.htm.)
The changes were made by EarthData
International, a company that the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) contracts to take
aerial photos. (The USGS then sells the images
to companies for commercial use.) When
EarthData went to the U.S. Secret Service to get
permission to fly over airspace that’s been
restricted since the September 11, 2001, terror-
ist attacks, the Secret Service requested that
the images of certain buildings be degraded.
The Federal government isn’t alone in limiting
Internet access to aerial photos. The New York
state GIS (Geographic Information System)
Clearinghouse (www.nysgis.state.ny.us)
offers high-resolution aerial photos of the entire
state but also restricts Web access to photos
with areas that are deemed sensitive.
Just how much additional security is provided
from censoring publicly available aerial photos
is debatable. Images of the same government
buildings and critical infrastructure facilities can
be downloaded and viewed from other sources.
And blacking out or reducing the detail of critical
facilities might just end up drawing a terrorist’s
attention to someplace that domestic authorities
have identified as a possible target. Sigh.
Welcome to the brave new world of post-9/11.

TerraServer.com has satellite images and color aerial photos available for
many urban areas in and outside the United States that aren’t available 
on TerraServer-USA. If you don’t need high-resolution images, the free color
images might meet your needs. Otherwise, you’ll need to subscribe to the
TerraServer.com service and order the images or generate screenshots of the
images you’re interested in.
Displaying a TerraServer.com image
To find an image, move your cursor over the Search item in the Web site’s
menu bar. Click one of the following menu items to see whether the
TerraServer.com database has an image of the area you’re interested in:
 Coordinates: You can search for an image by latitude and longitude
coordinates, either in decimal degrees or degrees, minutes, and seconds.
 City (United States): Enter a city in the United States (and optionally, its
state).
 City (International): TerraServer.com has a collection of international
city images. Enter the city you’re interested in viewing and its country.
 Zip Code: Enter a ZIP code to display the center point of the ZIP code
area. (This applies only to the U.S.)

 County: Enter a county in the United States (and optionally, its state). An
image with the center of the county will be displayed.
 Address: Enter a street address (United States) and the city and state
(or ZIP code).
After you enter your search criteria and click Search, TerraServer.com
queries its database for matches. The three possible search outcomes are
 Bupkis: No images in the TerraServer.com database meet your criteria. 
Check your spelling or change your search criteria before you give up.
 Multiple matches: A appears with the matching images; you select the
one you want. For example, if you search for a city named Bend but
don’t specify the state, you get a list of cities in Oregon, Montana,
California, Texas, and other states.
 Perfect match: TerraServer.com found a single match in its database.
Pay dirt! From the list of available image types (with the supplier, date,
and resolution), click the image you’d like to view.
TerraServer.com has many international images, but don’t expect photos of
every place on Earth. The international images are mostly large urban areas
and aren’t available for all metropolitan areas outside the United States.
Moving in a TerraServer.com image
After you display an image, you can change the image’s location by panning
and its resolution by zooming in and out.
 Panning: Panning simply means moving the image to view an unseen
area. It’s like scrolling without the scroll bars. To pan the image
1. Make sure that the Pan radio button to the left of the image is
selected.
2. Hold down the left mouse button on the image and drag the
direction you want to move the image.
For example, to see more area to the north of the image, drag down
toward the bottom of the screen.
3. Release the mouse button.
After a moment, the new image is displayed.
 Zooming: TerraServer.com has a plus and minus button to the left of the
image (refer to Figure 20-5) to control zooming in and out. (There’s also
a Zoom In by Click radio button that you can select so that when you
click the image, you automatically zoom in.)
325
Chapter 20: Overhead Image Web Sites

Unless you’ve subscribed to the TerraServer.com service, you can’t zoom
in on an image beyond 8-meter resolution. However, you can zoom out to
view a larger area with less detail.
When you move the cursor over an image, the latitude and longitude coordi-
nates of the location under the cursor are displayed to the left of the image.
This is helpful for identifying specific locations.
GlobeXplorer
GlobeXplorer (www.globexplorer.com) specializes in selling online aerial
photos, satellite images, and maps of the United States. You can browse
through the GlobeXplorer’s database of images for free, but all images are
marked with a series of GlobeXplorer watermarks. If you subscribe to the
GlobeXplorer service for a fee ($29.95 a month), you can view images without
watermarks.
The watermarks aren’t small and subtle. If you want to use the images for
something other than personal reference, you’ll need to subscribe to the ser-
vice or buy a copy of the image without the watermarks. However, you can
increase the resolution of images to 1-meter or less for a considerable amount
of detail. GlobeXplorer also has a very large database of color images.
Displaying a GlobeXplorer image
GlobeXplorer uses the ImageAtlas Web-based tool to search through the com-
pany’s database of aerial images. You start ImageAtlas from GlobeXplorer’s
main Web page.
After ImageAtlas is running, you can search for images three different ways:
 Map: ImageAtlas starts up with a satellite image, basemap of the United
States. Click an area to zoom in, and keep clicking until the location
you’re interested in appears. The map to the left of the image shows
such features as cities and roads to help you figure out where you are.
 Address: Enter the street address of the place you want to see in the
text boxes next to the left of the image. At the minimum, you need to fill
in a city and state or a ZIP code.
 Latitude and longitude: If you know the latitude and longitude of the
location, you can use it to display the image. Enter the coordinates in
decimal degrees in the text boxes to the left of the image.
After you enter the address or coordinates, click the Find Image button, and
the aerial photo is displayed.
326
Part IV: Using Web-hosted Mapping Services 

GlobeXplorer works only with Microsoft’s Internet Explorer Web browser. If
you’re using Netscape, Mozilla, Opera, or another browser, you need to use
Internet Explorer to access the Web site.
Zooming in on a GlobeXplorer image
After an image is displayed at GlobeXplorer.com, you can zoom in to see more
detail. Underneath the image is a zoom scale, represented by a series of dots.
 Clicking the dot to the farthest left displays the largest area of coverage
at the least amount of resolution. The dots on the extreme left display
satellite images of the area.
 Clicking the dot on the farthest right displays the smallest area of cover-
age with the greatest amount of detail. The dots on the right display
aerial photos of the area.
A zoom box lets you draw a rectangle over the part of the photo where you
want to see more detail. Follow these steps:
1. Select the Drag a Box to Zoom In radio button.
2. Move the cursor over the area you want to zoom in on.
3. Hold down the left mouse button and draw a rectangle over the area.
When you release the mouse button, the image zooms in to the area that
you defined with the rectangle. An example of a zoomed in image at max-
imum resolution is shown in Figure 20-6.

Chapter 20: Overhead Image Web Sites
Black-and-white or color?
Ever wonder why some images are shown in
black-and-white while others are displayed in
color? The short answer is that black-and-white
film was used to create most of the USGS aerial
photo data for the United States — and black-
and-white film, processing, and photographic
paper are cost-effective and stable. Color film,
processing, and photographic paper are expen-
sive, and color exposures (positives, negatives,
and prints) can lose tonal quality over time.
Commercial companies that produce custom
aerial photos and images for resale tend to use
color film for enhanced resolution and viewing.
Most of the large urban areas in the U.S. have
color images available because there is a
greater opportunity for a commercial aerial
photo company to sell the data, thus recouping
the costs of taking the aerial photos and making
a profit. Sometime in the future, high-resolution
color images of the entire U.S. will be available,
but for now, if the area you’re interested is far
away from a major city, you’ll just have to settle
for black-and-white.

Moving around in a GlobeXplorer image
After you display an image, you can move to a new location to focus on the
area you want to view.
 A frame with compass directions surrounds the photo. Click the com-
pass direction to scroll the image. For example, if you click NORTH, the
image scrolls up to the north.
 Select the Pan/Recenter radio button beneath the zoom scale. When you
click the image, the photo is reorientated so wherever you clicked
appears in the center. You can also move the image by holding down the
left mouse button while the cursor is over the photo and then dragging.
When you release the mouse button, a new location is shown.
Overlaying a street map in GlobeXplorer
GlobeXplorer has a slick feature with which you can overlay a MapQuest
street map over a portion of the image. (An example is shown in Figure 20-7.)
Because an aerial photo isn’t labeled with streets, this option can help you
quickly orientate yourself. To overlay a street map

eclectic collection of GPS and map-related information.
Stuff so intriguing and thought provoking that it deserved
a part of its own (or something like that).

Ten Great GPS and Map Web Sites
In This Chapter
 Getting up-to-speed on GPS
 Staying current with GPS news
 Getting technical GPS information
 Downloading free maps
 Mapping from your desktop
 Modeling terrain
T
he Internet has a tremendous number of GPS and map resources. This
chapter contains what I consider the ten best (actually, there’s more than
ten, but who’s counting?) Web sites about GPS and digital mapping. Listed Web
sites have product reviews, in-depth technical information, friendly people to
ask questions, and many sources for free maps to download.
Comprehensive GPS Information
When I’m asked for an Internet GPS resource, I suggest these two Web sites:
 www.gpsinformation.net: Since 1997, Joe Mehaffey, Jack Yeazel, and
Dale DePriest have compiled information about GPS, including receivers,
software, and antennas. Their comprehensive and frequently updated
Web site is packed with technical information, reviews, and common
sense advice for novice to experienced GPS users. This site is a must 
for anyone who owns or is considering owning a GPS receiver. You’ll 
discover something here, however much experience you have.
 http://vancouver-webpages.com/peter/index.html: Peter Bennett’s
GPS site was one of the first Internet sites devoted to the topic of GPS.
The site contains links and information resources for different brands of
GPS receivers. If you’re writing your own program to interface with a GPS
receiver, this is the place to find out about National Marine Electronics
Association (NMEA) and other manufacturer communication protocols.

Current GPS News and Helpful Advice
The sci.geo.satellite-nav newsgroup is one of the best Internet resources
for current GPS-related news. The newsgroup also features a cadre of frequent
contributors who provide answers to all types of questions about GPS.
Before you post a question to the newsgroup, such as What’s the best GPS
receiver?, search through old posts with Google for previous discussion
threads about your question. GPS newsgroup gurus are generally patient, but
they do expect you to do a little homework first. If you can’t find any archived
information that helps, post a question (and provide as much detailed infor-
mation as possible). If you’re asking which GPS receiver might be the best,
provide as much detailed information about your needs as you can.
If you don’t have USENET newsgroup reading software or your ISP doesn’t
carry the sci.geo.satellite-nav news feed, you can view and post group
messages with a Web browser at Google’s cache of this newsgroup:
groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=sci.geo.satellite-nav
Geocaching.com’s discussion forums are an excellent source of news and
advice. Because GPS receivers are integral to the sport of geocaching (read
about this in Chapter 7), check out the GPS Units and Software forum where
geocachers share their experience and wisdom with others. You’ll find lots 
of timely news and reviews. Geocachers are some of the most serious civilian
users of GPS, so there’s excellent real-world information. The forums are
located at forums.groundspeak.com/GC.
If you own a popular Magellan Meridian GPS receiver, one of the best sources
of information on the receiver is the Magellan Meridian Yahoo! Group at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Magellan_Meridian.
Technical GPS Information
If you’re interested in technical, nitty-gritty details of GPS, check Sam Wormley’s
GPS Resources Web site. It’s a collection of links to sites that get into the sci-
ence of GPS and other resources that are more suited to the average consumer
GPS user. Go to www.edu-observatory.org/gps/gps.html.
Free Maps
Yes, one of the joys of the Internet is that you can download all sorts of free
digital maps. Most of the map data has been created by various government
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

agencies and is made freely available to the public. In most cases, you’ll need
mapping programs to view the maps (described in different chapters of the
book), but some of the maps can be opened with graphics programs to print
and use. The biggest challenge in downloading free maps is finding them.
Here are some Web sites that you should find helpful in your search:
 www.doylesdartden.com/gis: David Doyle is an environmental geologist
(and dart frog aficionado) who maintains an extensive list of U.S. digital
map resources. His list at this site is organized by state. You’ll find hun-
dreds of links for aerial photographs, topographic maps, geological maps,
and many other different types of digital maps.
 www.macgpspro.com/html/newhtml/maplibrary.html: James
Associates makes MacGPS Pro, a product for interfacing GPS receivers.
The company hosts a list of United States and international free map
sources.
 www.lib.berkeley.edu/EART: Unlike the United States (where digital
maps are readily available), in other parts of the world, accurate maps
are considered essential to national security and can be difficult to obtain.
One of my favorite sources for international maps is the University of
California Berkeley’s online Earth Sciences & Map Library, where you
can download topographic maps for many countries.
 www.lib.utexas.edu/maps: My other favorite academic map site is the
University of Texas at Austin’s Perry-Castañeda Library Map Collection.
This site has an extensive collection of online maps (as well as links to
sites that host maps) for countries and places all over the world.
 oddens.geog.uu.nl/index.html: The most comprehensive collection
of map links on the Internet is Odden’s Bookmarks. This European Web
site has over 20,000 links to maps and map sites all over the world. 
You can spend hours browsing through links to international map
sources.
Expert Desktop Mapping Guidance
Paul Pingrey is a longtime forester who recognized the importance of digital
mapping for land management purposes and decided to spread the word. His
Digital Grove Web site is a collection of mapping programs, map data sources,
and information on how to create 2-D and 3-D maps. Pingrey focuses on free
and low-cost programs, proving that you don’t need to spend thousands of
dollars on Geographic Information System (GIS) software or be a GIS profes-
sional to produce high-quality maps. Pingrey frequently updates his easy-to-
navigate and well-designed site with new tools and information. If you’re
interested in desktop mapping (and you don’t need to be land manager or
forester), check it out at www.digitalgrove.net.

Definitive Terrain Modeling Information
This book really only scratches the surface of some of the cool things you can
do with 3-D mapping. The most definitive Internet resource on the subject is
John Childs’ Digital Terrain Modeling Journal. Childs’ Web site presents practi-
cal how-to tutorials, data sources, and news for creating 3-D maps. Even if you
aren’t interested in making your own 3-D maps, you should visit this site just

Ten Map Printing Tips

 Using legal sized paper
 Selecting color versus black-and-white maps
 Printing the scale
 Displaying UTM grids
 Using waterproof paper
 Waterproofing paper
 Printing more map than you need

I
f you’re using a digital map, odds are that sooner or later you’re going to
want to print it. Paper maps don’t run out of batteries, and they’re pretty
easy to carry wherever you go. You can just use the Print command to trans-
form the bits into ink, but some other techniques make using a paper map
easier.
Make Your Paper Count
The more map and information you can get on a sheet of paper, the better. 
Most home and business printers are usually fed a diet of 8.5 x 11-inch paper . . . 
but 8.5 x 14-inch, legal size paper exists, too. One legal size sheet gives you 119
square inches of print area; an 8.5 x 11-inch sheet has only 93.5 square inches 
of print area.
Some mapping programs can reduce the map scale to get more data on a
page. For example, more of the map appears when you print at 75 percent of
the original instead of 100 percent. Remember, though, that the detail on the
map becomes smaller and more difficult to read when you reduce the scale.

Just remember when you reduce the size of a map that displays a printed
scale, such as 1:24,000 or one-inch-equals-a-mile, that the scale will no longer
be accurate on the reduced map.
Print in Color
Maps are usually printed in color because it’s easier for the brain to recog-
nize and process colors than plain black-and-white. For example, on a United
States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic map, you can tell at a glance
that lightly shaded green areas are forested and that a solid red line is a
major highway. Although navigating with a black-and-white map is certainly
possible, using a map that’s printed in color is quite a bit easier.
Print the Scale
A map without a scale is like a recipe with only the ingredients listed — not
the quantities. You can guess that you add a tablespoon of salt instead of a
cup, but the dish tastes a whole lot better if you know the proper amounts.
The same is true with a map. If the scale is printed on a map (especially with
distance rulers), you can easily judge how far features are from each other.
Print UTM Grids
Most mapping software that supports topographic maps can overlay
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system grids on the map. If
you’re using a GPS receiver with your map, UTM grids make it extremely easy
to figure out where you are on the map. Just look at the GPS coordinates of
your position, and then count the Northing and Easting tick marks on the
map to find your location. (Chapter 2 shows you how to use UTM coordinates
to plot locations.)
Use Waterproof Paper
If you plan to use your map outdoors, consider printing it on waterproof
paper. Waterproof paper for common inkjet printers uses a vinyl material to
produce waterproof, durable, and tear-resistant maps. The paper is a little
thicker than regular paper, but you can still fold it. There is also special
waterproof paper for copiers and laser printers that serves a similar function.
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Waterproof paper is a little pricey — about a dollar a sheet. To prevent your-
self from wasting expensive paper from printing blunders, first print the map
on normal paper to make sure that it looks right.
Never use waterproof inkjet paper in copiers or laser printers. The heat of their
printing processes can melt waterproof inkjet paper and wreck the printer.
Here are three sources of waterproof paper for your maps:
 Latitude 26: This company sells waterproof inkjet paper in a number of
sizes, including rolls. Its Web site has information on paper specifica-
tions and pricing: www.lat26inc.com.
 National Geographic: National Geographic sells waterproof Adventure
Paper for inkjet printers. You can order it from this Web site: http://
maps.nationalgeographic.com/topo/adventure.cfm.
 Rite in the Rain: Rite in the Rain is a popular supplier of waterproof 
field notebooks and paper. If you want to print maps on laser printers 
or copy machines, Rite in the Rain makes the right kind of paper for you.
This Web site has a list of various waterproof paper products: www.
riteintherain.com.
If you’re not venturing into the weather, consider using digital photography
paper if you have an inkjet printer. The quality and detail is much better than
plain paper for topographic maps.
Waterproof Your Plain Paper
If you must use plain-paper maps outdoors, here are some ways to avoid a
runny, pulpy mess:
 Carry your maps in a watertight map case or a resealable food 
storage bag.
 Create waterproof maps with these options:
• Sealers coat a piece of paper in clear plastic. One of my favorite
commercial sealers is Map Seal. A 4-ounce bottle coats approxi-
mately 8–10 square feet of paper and costs around $7. You can find
this at www.aquaseal.com/map-seal.html.
• Contact paper is transparent plastic with a sticky back. You can
sandwich a piece of paper between two sheets to waterproof the
map. Contact paper, which is cheap, comes in rolls so you can cut
it to size. Just remember that contact paper doesn’t hold up over
the long haul.
339
Chapter 22: Ten Map Printing Tips

• Lamination involves placing the paper between sheets of a special
plastic that seals (when heated) around the paper. Copy centers
charge a few dollars to laminate a letter-size piece of paper.
Maps laminated with thick plastic can’t be folded. Lighter laminates can
be folded.
If you’re on a budget, put two maps together back to back and then lami-
nate them. If you’re laminating many maps, the savings add up.
Print More Map Area
If you’re planning on visiting a specific place, add a little more area to your
map than you think you need. It’s tempting just to print a map that shows
exactly where you’re going — and nothing more. But what if you decide to
take a side trip to someplace just off your route that isn’t on the map? What 
if you’re interested in a feature you see in the distance? From my years of
search and rescue and outdoor recreation experience, I’ve discovered that
you should always have more map than you think you’ll need.
Put North at the Top
Most maps are orientated with north at the top. When you print a map, follow
the same convention. If the map doesn’t have a compass rose that indicates
directions, you’ll know that
 North is at the top of the map.
 East is to the right.
 South is at the bottom.
 West is to the left.
If you’re using a graphics program to edit a digital map, consider adding a
north-pointing arrow in case the map doesn’t have one. It’s a reassuring
reminder that north is indeed the direction you think it is.
Use the Best Page Orientation
Before you print your map, decide which page orientation will work best. In
your software’s Page Setup dialog box, select the orientation. 
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Portrait prints the map lengthwise. This is the default for most printers.
 Landscape prints the map widthwise.
Use the Print Preview command (if the software supports it) to see what the
printed map will look like. If the orientation doesn’t display as much of the
map as you want, change the orientation to the other format.
Beware of False Economy
I can remember when gas stations gave away road maps for free. (I sometimes
catch myself saying, “Back in the days when maps were free . . . ” when I’m
reminiscing.)
It’s easy to think that the days of free gas station maps are back. You can down-
load free maps from the Internet or use inexpensive mapping software. Get a
digital map, fire up the color printer, and you’ve got a map! (Just remember the
cost of the paper, ink cartridges, printer wear and tear, and the time involved in
printing a map.)
Here’s an expensive example. An entire USGS 7.5 minute topographic map
takes either nine sheets of 8.5 x 11-inch paper or six sheets of 8.5 x 14-inch
legal size paper if you’re printing at 1:24,000 scale. The costs add up when
you’re using special paper and lots of color, which empties your ink car-
tridges. Compare this with shelling out six dollars for an official copy of the
USGS map.
Sometimes paper maps for a few dollars can’t be beat.

Ten Tips for Athletes
In This Chapter
 Understanding benefits and limitations of GPS receivers for training
 Determining the best way to carry your GPS receiver
 Cycling, golf, and water sports
 Organizing races with GPS
I
do a lot of running and biking, every now and then entering some pretty
crazy endurance events like ultramarathons, Ironman triathlons, and
adventure races. A GPS receiver can make a pretty good training partner: You
can use it for lots of things besides helping you avoid getting lost. This chap-
ter is for athletes who exercise outside in the fresh air (sorry, no gym tips)
and want to know how to incorporate GPS receivers into their workouts.
Observant readers will notice more than ten tips in this chapter. It’s your
bonus for getting to the end of the book (and paying attention).
General GPS Tips for Athletes
GPS tips in this chapter apply to a number of different sports:
 Different uses for GPS when exercising
 GPS limitations while training
 Carrying a GPS receiver
Using a GPS receiver for training
A GPS receiver not only helps you successfully get between Point A and Point
B but is also handy for staying found. These tips apply to almost any sport:
 Measure distances over known courses: Instead of guessing the course
or route length, you can use a GPS receiver to measure the distance with
a fair amount of accuracy.

 Better understand the elevation of courses: Elevation data can give you
a more accurate sense of how flat or hilly a course really is. Even if your
GPS receiver doesn’t have a barometric altimeter (which is required for
more precise altitude measurement), the elevation data associated with
recorded tracks gives you a ballpark idea of how steep a course is.
 Better understand speed: Your GPS receiver has a trip computer that
provides information about your maximum, minimum, and average
speed. By analyzing track data, you can measure your speed over indi-
vidual sections of a course.
 Discover new courses: Uploading recorded tracks to an aerial photo or
topographic map shows you where you’ve been and can also reveal
nearby roads or trails that you didn’t know about.
Your GPS receiver can play a few roles as an electronic training partner:
 Data logger: In this mode, the GPS receiver records data that you
process when you get back home. You download the data to your PC
and a program that analyzes the track log. While you’re working out, you
never really look at the GPS receiver (unless you get lost, of course).
You can use any general purpose GPS receiver as a data logger. I like the
Garmin Geko series because they’re small, lightweight, inexpensive (the
201 model is under $140) and easy to carry. (Avoid the Geko 101 because
it can’t interface to a computer, which means you can’t analyze track logs.)
When you’re logging data, follow these rules:
• Lock sufficient satellites: Always make sure your GPS receiver has a
lock on at least four satellites (the minimum you need for a good 
3-D fix) before you start your workout.
• Start clean: Before you start, clear the active track log. When you’re
finished working out, immediately turn off the GPS receiver.
Always download the active log to your computer first before saving it 
in the GPS receiver. Some GPS receivers remove the track date and time
data or compress the number of tracks when you save a track log.
 Coach: In this mode, you use the GPS receiver to give you immediate
feedback while you’re working out. It’s still logging track data, but you’re
looking at the screen, checking your speed, distance, and time. Several
GPS receivers on the market are specifically designed to perform as a
workout coach; I discuss these models in this chapter.
Don’t use your GPS receiver’s battery saver mode if you’re using your GPS
receiver to record tracks while you’re working out. The accuracy of your
tracks will be diminished because satellite data is received less often. Use
rechargeable batteries instead.
344
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Aside from a GPS receiver and a cable to download the collected data to a
computer (see Chapter 9 to read how), you also need software so you can
analyze your performance based on the tracks that have been recorded.
Some possibilities include
 Endless Pursuit (www.endlesspursuit.com): This Web-hosted, work-
out-logging product is designed specifically for athletes. I review this in
the section, “Endless Pursuit.”
 TopoFusion (www.topofusion.com): Although this mapping program
wasn’t designed primarily to log workouts, its authors include features
so an athlete better understands his or her performance over a set
course by analyzing track data, including moving, stopped, uphill, down-
hill, and flat time; up/down/flat distance; average uphill/downhill grade;
and maximum speed. A recent beta version of the program included an
athlete’s logbook and difficulty-and-effort indices for record tracks. This
program, reasonably priced at $40, is turning into one of my favorite log-
ging tools.
 GPS utility programs: Two shareware programs — GPS Utility (www.
gpsu.co.uk) and GARtrip (www.gartrip.de) — are general-purpose
GPS tools but have features for analyzing track logs. Both programs have
features that examine distance, speed, and time data. Registered ver-
sions are available for under $50.
 Spreadsheets: Because track data can be exported into comma- or tab-
delimited text files (see Chapter 9 for a list of GPS conversion utilities,
with some tips on using them), if you know your way around a spread-
sheet program such as Microsoft Excel, it’s pretty easy to write your
own formulas and macros to analyze the data that you collect.
GPS receiver limitations for training
Before you start training with a GPS receiver, don’t expect precise accuracy
of the receiver all the time. Speed and distance measurements are based on
exact position data; if the location coordinates the GPS receiver is reporting
aren’t accurate, the speed and distance data isn’t accurate, either.
The main cause of inaccurate GPS data is poor satellite signal reception. When
you train under heavy tree canopies, in canyons (whether natural or the urban
type from tall buildings), or anywhere satellite signals are obstructed, your
speed and distance data isn’t going as accurate as if you had a clear sky.
To me, this isn’t critical. The data from my GPS receiver is far more accurate
than guessing how far and how fast I’ve gone. I treat a GPS receiver as simply
another tool that gives me training data to process so I can fine-tune my
workouts and performance, just like using a watch or a heart-rate monitor.
345
Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Athletes

Here are a few ways to address GPS accuracy issues for training:
 Repeat and average: If you’re measuring a specific running or biking
course, do it several times and average the results to compensate for
any GPS inaccuracies.
 Watch for breaks: Watch for any possible breaks in satellite coverage on
the course that might affect accuracy. This is usually easy to spot
because track points displayed on a map will suddenly be off-course and
are easily distinguished by jagged lines.
How to carry your GPS receiver on foot
If you use a GPS receiver for your outdoor workouts, one of your biggest deci-
sions will be how to carry the GPS receiver. The simplest way is just to hold it
in your hand, if it’s free. Of the number of other different ways to carry a GPS
receiver (which I discuss next), the best carry methods will
 Provide optimal GPS satellite signal reception: Where you work out
might dictate how you carry your GPS receiver. If you live on the plains
(flat) without any trees and have excellent satellite reception, you have
more options than in the Pacific Northwest (heavy tree canopies).
 Be comfortable: Carrying a GPS receiver should not distract you from
your workout. However you carry it, it should be comfortable, and you
really shouldn’t notice carrying or wearing it.
Here are some different ways to carry a GPS receiver while working out. How
you carry a GPS receiver usually ends up being a personal preference. Try a
few of these methods to see which one works best for you.
Armbands
Armbands, especially with smaller, lightweight GPS receivers, are one of my
favorite forms of no-hands carry. An armband is simply a GPS receiver case
mounted to an adjustable elastic band.
When worn on the upper arm, the GPS receiver isn’t blocked by your body as
much as wearing the receiver at your waist, which means better satellite
signal reception. In areas without many sky obstructions, armbands can also
be worn on your forearm, so you can look at the screen while you exercise.
I use an armband with a plastic case that’s produced by Endless Pursuit
(www.endlesspursuit.com). The case fits a Garmin Geko like a glove. After
you adjust the elastic band, it’s hard to tell you’re wearing it. (See Figure 23-1
for an illustration of the armband.)
346
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Not many armbands are built for small and mid-sized GPS receivers. Look for
armbands designed for Family Radio Service (FRS) radios. If you’re handy
with a sewing machine (or know someone who is), it’s relatively easy to make
an armband out of nylon, elastic, and Velcro for your GPS receiver.
Cases, belts, pockets, and packs
Most GPS receiver cases have a loop on the back to hold the case on a belt.
If you’re wearing shorts or tights and don’t have a belt, waist packs for carry-
ing a radio or a cassette/CD player are an option. These packs can accommo-
date larger GPS receivers. They’re not very noticeable when you’re working
out because they’re designed not to bounce much. Small fanny packs and
waist packs that carry water bottles also carry a GPS receiver.
If the GPS receiver is small, try carrying it in your front pants pocket. I’ve car-
ried a Garmin Geko while running and cross-country skiing in trail-running
shorts and tights with zipper pockets. Although satellite reception is some-
times lost while under heavy tree cover, the GPS receiver records track data
as long as I have a mostly clear view of the sky.
OK

347
Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Athletes

The main disadvantage to carrying your GPS receiver on or below your waist
is that it’s not the best place for satellite reception. There’s a good chance
that you’ll lose the signal in areas with reduced satellite coverage.
If you use a hydration pack or a lightweight backpack, you can get your GPS
higher for better satellite reception by mounting the case either on one of the
front shoulder straps or putting the GPS receiver in the upper, top pocket of
your backpack. (It isn’t as accessible in the backpack pocket but should get
good satellite reception.)
Water bottle hand straps
Many trail and ultramarathon runners run with water bottles in their hands,
using special hand strap products that fit on a water bottle so you aren’t
always clutching the bottle and can relax your hands. (FastDraw by Ultimate
Direction is one; see www.ultimatedirection.com.) I’ve seen trail runners
with small GPS receiver cases mounted to these hand straps. Just add some
Velcro to the GPS receiver case and the hand strap, and you’re ready to go.
GPS Products for Athletes
Several GPS products on the market are specifically designed for athletes.
These products offer athletes specialized features that normally aren’t found
in general purpose GPS hardware and software.
Endless Pursuit
Endless Pursuit is an Internet-based service that allows athletes to track their
training on the Web. The service is based on using a Garmin or Magellan GPS
receiver to collect data about your workout and then uploading the GPS data
to a Web site through your browser. After the site collects waypoint and track
data of a workout, it produces 40 statistics and 14 charts. (Sample results are
shown in Figure 23-2.) You can review workout information such as
 Total time elapsed (at motion and at rest)
 Distance (uphill, downhill, and flat)
 Altitude
 Maximum and average speed (including uphill, downhill, and flat)
 Average pace
 Calories expended
 Power generated in watts
348
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The Web site also serves as cumulative training log for all your workouts. After
you sign in, a monthly calendar lists all your workouts by day, showing the
type of activity, what time of day you worked out, distance, and total elapsed
time (see Figure 23-3). Click a previous workout to display all the details about
the session, including aerial photographs and topographic maps of your route.
You can even compare workouts to see how you’ve improved.
Check the community section at the Web site where folks can post their
workout data for anyone who has Internet access. All the published workouts
(or treks, as Endless Pursuit calls them) are indexed. For example, you can do
a search for all the mountain bike rides in Central Oregon and get maps of
routes, trail reviews, and even download the waypoints and tracks associated
with the trek directly to your GPS receiver.
Endless Pursuit is easy to use and well designed. The data that it provides
goes far beyond the distance, speed, and time information from a normal GPS
receiver. (Note the add-on option to integrate heart-rate monitor data with
your GPS data.) Although just about any outdoor athlete can benefit from
Endless Pursuit, it’s especially well suited for mountain and road bikers, run-
ners, and triathletes.

Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Athletes

To fully use the site, purchase a Performance Pass ($149), which allows you to
store data for up to 150 workouts; you can delete old ones to free up space.
Endless Pursuit also offers a bundled package priced at $299 that includes a
Performance Pass, GPS receiver, cable, armband, and bike mount that provides
everything you need to start logging GPS data.
You can register for a free trial of Endless Pursuit and read more about the
service by visiting www.endlesspursuit.com.
Timex Speed + Distance/Bodylink
The Timex Speed + Distance system is a cigarette pack-size GPS receiver that
straps on your arm and transmits data to a special wristwatch. You can look
at your watch and see how far you’ve gone and how fast you’re going.
Timex updated the system in 2003, adding more components and calling it
Bodylink. In addition to the GPS receiver and watch, the Bodylink includes 
a heart-rate monitor (the GPS receiver, watch, and heart-rate monitor are
shown in Figure 23-4) and a data recorder that collects data from both the
GPS receiver and the heart-rate monitor. You can connect the data recorder
to your personal computer to upload your workout data and analyze it with
the included software.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

This is pretty close to being the Holy Grail for athletes who want perfor-
mance data. Time, speed, distance, and heart-rate data can be viewed with
training software to understand your fitness and the effectiveness of your
workouts.
You can’t use Bodylink for navigation. Your current location doesn’t appear
on the watch, and the system doesn’t support tracks and waypoints. (Timex
might add navigation capabilities to future models.) To find different Bodylink
models, which retail between $250 and $300, go to www.timex.com.
Garmin Forerunner 201
Garmin’s Forerunner 201 is a GPS receiver primarily for runners: The receiver
looks like an oversized watch and is designed to wear on your wrist. (The
Forerunner 201 is shown in Figure 23-5.) Some of its features include
 Time (overall and lap), speed (current and average), and distance display
 Waypoint and track log support
 Stored workout history
 Pace and calories-expended information
 Large, easy-to-read screen

Unlike the Timex Bodylink system (which Garmin originally provided the tech-
nology for), the Forerunner’s GPS receiver is built into the watch: It doesn’t
require a separate armband unit.
The Forerunner 201 doesn’t support a heart-rate monitor, but I wouldn’t be too
surprised if future versions will incorporate heart-rate monitor technology.

Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Athletes

I’m impressed with the Forerunner 201’s performance, especially for a first
generation entry in this market. The satellite reception has been good, and
its data is useful for understanding biking, running, and skiing workouts.
(Garmin recently released the Forerunner 101, a cheaper model that runs on
AAA batteries. I’d avoid this product because it doesn’t have a PC interface,
which means that you can’t download and analyze your track data nor
upgrade the firmware.)
The Forerunner 201 has a suggested retail price of $160. To find out more
about product specifications and to download the user manual, go to www.
garmin.com/products/forerunner201. There’s also a great e-mail list
devoted to the product that can be accessed at http://groups.yahoo.

GPS Tips for Specific Sports
You can use a GPS receiver for almost any type of outdoor sport where you’re
in motion. Here’s how GPS fits into the context of several specific sports.
GPS for cyclists
If you’re a road cyclist or mountain biker, a GPS receiver can replace your
bike computer because it can display time, speed, and distance information.
Most GPS receiver manufacturers make bike mounts for their handheld
models; these mounts also fit on motorcycle and snowmobile handlebars.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

The main advantages of using a GPS receiver for biking are that it
 Doesn’t need calibrating
 Is easy to switch between different bikes
 Has navigation features including maps (if supported)
Compared with bike computers, GPS receivers have a few disadvantages:
 Shorter battery life
 Higher price
 Larger size
 Accuracy affected by tree cover
If you just want to use your GPS receiver for logging data, such as recording
trail routes under heavy tree cover, try stowing your GPS receiver in a back-
pack and mounting an external antenna on the top of your bike helmet,
threading the antenna cable out the back of the helmet and into the pack
where it’s plugged in to the GPS receiver. It might sound and look geeky, but a
setup like this gives you optimum satellite reception. Just make sure that the
antenna cable is tucked in and secured so it doesn’t catch on a tree branch.
Some Garmin GPS receivers, notably the eTrex models when used with Garmin
bike mounts, can intermittently shut down when biking on rough terrain. Your
GPS receiver probably isn’t defective. The battery compartment of the eTrex
doesn’t provide a snug fit for the batteries; vibration can jostle the batteries
around, causing power loss. If this happens, tape the batteries together or use
a small piece of cardboard as a shim to fill the extra space.
GPS for golfers
Because golf is all about distance and getting a ball from Point A to Point B in
the least number of strokes, GPS offers some interesting possibilities.
The simplest way to use GPS in golf is to bring your GPS receiver with you the
next time you play and mark the center of greens as waypoints. When you
play the course again, you can select the waypoints for a pretty good idea of
the distance to the next green and use that information when selecting an
appropriate club. (GPS receivers and devices like laser range finders aren’t
allowed in tournament play — and some of your purist golf partners might
not approve of electronics for casual play.)
Some golf courses are on the GPS bandwagon, offering cart-based computers
that display color maps; the distance to the greens, holes, and hazards; pro
tips; and other information. As an example, visit www.riteconcepts.com to
see a demonstration of its OnCourse GPS product.
353
Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Athletes

A number of personal GPS products are developed specifically for golfers:
 Suunto G9: Suunto makes an oversize watch that’s a GPS receiver that
measures your strokes and stores game statistics (www.suunto.com).
 SkyGolf: SkyGolf sells a standalone GPS golf computer, the SG2 Personal
Digital Caddie (www.skygolfgps.com).
 PDA software: A number of popular golf software packages come bun-
dled with a GPS receiver for Pocket PC and Palm PDAs, including
• StarCaddy: www.starcaddy.com
• GolfPS: www.golfps.com
GPS golf devices can slow down the game while players fiddle with their elec-
tronic gadgets. If you use a GPS golf device, remember to be courteous to
other players and not get too engrossed with your nonregulation helper.
GPS for paddlers and rowers
For athletes who row or paddle for fitness or in competitions, a GPS receiver
provides a quick and easy way to gauge distance and speed without installing
a speedometer in your boat; they’re also cheaper than venturi speedometers.
I’ve seen GPS receiver cases mounted to canoes, kayaks, and rowing shells
using Velcro, duct tape, webbing, and custom-made fiberglass holders, all
optimally placed to let the athlete read the screen and click buttons.
Obviously, make sure that your GPS receiver stays dry. Your GPS receiver
should have an IPX 7 rating (submersible for 30 minutes in one meter of water).
Regardless of the rating, I use a waterproof bag. Voyageur bags (one is shown
in Figure 23-6), priced under $25, are durable, watertight, and buoyant; it’s easy
to see the screen and use the receiver while it’s in the bag. You can get informa-
tion on the Voyageur product line by visiting http://voyageur-gear.com.
354
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Windsurfing and GPS
GPS receivers are popular in windsurfing.
Windsurfers use GPS receivers in waterproof
bags to measure maximum speed and record
tracks. Dennis Cornhill wrote a nice Excel
spreadsheet for analyzing windsurfing track logs:
www.geocities.com/denniscornhill/
SailTrack.html.

If you’re using a GPS receiver in any type of watercraft, tether the GPS
receiver (or its case or bag) to yourself or the boat. This is good insurance
against your receiver swimming to the bottom.
GPS for race directors
If you’re organizing and promoting a race with running, cycling, cross-country
skiing, or just about any other activity that follows a set course, a GPS
receiver can be a handy tool. With it you can
 Measure the course distance.
 Create a map of the course by overlaying tracks on an aerial photo or
topographic map.
 Use waypoints to mark the precise locations of aid stations.
 Publish the course track log on the Internet for athletes with GPS
receivers who want to train on the course before the race.
One of my favorite programs for race planning is TopoFusion (www.topofusion.
com; read more about this in Chapter 14). It imports waypoints and tracks from
GPS receivers and displays them on aerial photos and topographic maps down-
loaded from TerraServer-USA. (Read all about TerraServer-USA in Chapter 20.)
Its PhotoFusion feature makes it excellent for promoting races on the Internet.

Chapter 23: Ten Tips for Athletes

If you bring a digital camera while recording course information with your GPS
receiver, you can take photos at key points (such as intersections, extreme ter-
rain, aid stations, or scenic views). Afterwards, TopoFusion associates the time
you took the photo with time data in the track log and gives you the coordi-
nates where you took the picture.
TopoFusion can automatically generate a Web page that shows the recorded
tracks overlaid on both an aerial photo and topographic map. Wherever you
stopped and took a photo with your digital camera, TopoFusion places a
camera icon at that location on the map. (Just make sure your digital camera
clock is synced with the time on your GPS receiver.) When someone views
the Web page and moves the cursor over the camera icon, a thumbnail image
of the photo is displayed in the upper-right corner of the window. If a camera
icon on the map is clicked, the full-sized photo is displayed. Because athletes
like to have as much information about a race ahead of time, participants will
love you if you add this to a Web site promoting a race or an event.
TopoFusion does all the HTML and JavaScript coding for you; you don’t need
to know anything about developing a Web page. Just upload all the digital
photos and the files TopoFusion created to a Web server, and you’ve got an
instant online information source and interactive map for your race. If you
can code HTML, you can modify the page’s information and appearance.
