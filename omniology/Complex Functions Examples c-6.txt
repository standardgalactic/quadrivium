Introduction
Introduction
This is the sixth book containing examples from the Theory of Complex Functions. In this volume we
shall consider the rules of calculations or residues, both in ﬁnite singularities and in ∞. The theory
heavily relies on the Laurent series from the ﬁfth book in this series. The applications of the calculus
of residues are given in the seventh book.
Even if I have tried to be careful about this text, it is impossible to avoid errors, in particular in the
ﬁrst edition. It is my hope that the reader will show some understanding of my situation.

Rules of computation of residues
We refer in general to the following rules of computation of residues:
Definition of a residuum. Assume that f(z) is an analytic function deﬁned in a neighbourhood of
z0 ∈C (not necessarily at z0 itself) with the Laurent series expansion
f(z) =
+∞

n=−∞
an zn,
0 < |z| < r.
We deﬁne the residuum, or residue, of f(z) (more correctly of the complex diﬀerential form f(z) dz)
as the coeﬃcient of 1/z in the Laurent series, i.e.
res (f(z) dz; z0) = res (f(z); z0) :=
1
2πi

Γ
f(z) dz = a−1,
where Γ denotes any simple closed curve, which surrounds z0 in positive sense, and where there is no
other singularity of f(z) inside and on the curve Γ.
Rule I. If z0 ∈C is a pole of order ≤q, where q ∈N, of the analytic function f(z), then
res (f; z0) =
1
(q −1)! lim
z→z0
dq−1
dzq−1

(z −z0)q−1 f(z)

An important special case of rule I is
Rule Ia. If z0 is a simple pole or a removable singularity of the analytic function f(z), then
res (f; z0) = lim
z→z0 (z −z0) f(z).
Rule II. If A(z) and B(z) are analytic in a neighbourhood of z0, and B(z) has a zero of ﬁrst order
at z0, then the residuum of the quotient f(z) := A(z)/B(z) is given by
res (f(z); z0) = res
A(z)
B(z); z0

= A (z0)
B′ (z0).
We also have the following generalization of Rule II, which however is only rarely used, because it
usual implies some heavy calculations:
Rule III. Assume that A(z) and B(z) are both analytic in a neighbourhood of z0, and assume that
B(z) has a zero of second order. Then the residuum of the quotient f(z) = A(z)/B(z) at z0 it given
by
res (f(z); z0) = res
A(z)
B(z) ; z0

= 6 A′ (z0) B′′ (z0) −2 A (z0) B(3) (z0)
3 {B′′ (z0)}2
.
The complicated structure of Rule III above indicates why it should only rarely be applied.
Definition of the residuum at ∞. Assume that f(z) is analytic in the set |z| > R, so f(z) has
a Laurent series expansion
f(z) =
+∞

n=−∞
an zn.
We deﬁne the residuum at ∞as
res(f(z) dz; ∞) := −a−1,
where one should notice the change of sign.
Rule IV. Assume that f(z) has a zero at ∞. Then
res(f dz; ∞) = −lim
x→∞z f(z).
Rule V. Assume that f(z) is analytic for |z| > R.Then
res(f(z) dz; ∞) = −res

This may be expressed in the following way: If we change the variable in the Laurent series expansion
above by z = 1/w, then the singularity z0 = ∞is mapped into w0 = 0. Since
−1
w2 dw = d
 1
w

(= dz),
it follows by this change of variable that we have as a diﬀerential form
res(f(z) dz; ∞) = res

f


d
 1
w

; w0 = 0

,
which shows that it is the complex diﬀerential form, which is connected with the residues.
Cauchy’s residue theorem. Assume that f(z) is analytic in an open domain Ω ⊆C, and let Γ
be a simple, closed curve in Ω, run through in its positive direction, such that there are only a ﬁnite
number of singularities {z1, . . . , zk} of f(z) inside the curve, i.e. to the left of the curve seen in its
direction. Then

Γ
f(z) dz =

Special case of Cauchy’s residue theorem. Assume that f(z) is analytic in Ω = C\{z1, . . . , zk},
i.e. f(z) has only a ﬁnite number of singularities in C. then
k

n=1
res (f(z); zn) + res(f(z); ∞) = 0,
i.e. the sum of the residues is 0.
Finally, it should be mentioned that since functions like
1
sin z ,
1
cos z ,
tan z,
cot z,
1
sinh z ,
1
cosh z ,
tanh z,
coth z,
etc., does not have ∞as an isolated singularity, none of these functions has a residuum at ∞.

Residues in ﬁnite singularities
Example 2.1 Find the residuum of the function f(z) =
1
z2(z −1), z ̸= 0, 1, at the point 0.
Then compute

|z|= 1
2
dz
z2(z −1).
We expand f(z) into a Laurent series in the annulus 0 < |z| < 1, i.e. in a neighbourhood of z0 = 0.
Then
f(z) =
1
z2(z −1) = −1
z2 ·
1
1 −z = −1
z2
+∞

n=0
zn = −1
z2 −1
z −1 −· · · −zn −· · · .
The residuum is a−1 of this expansion, so it follows immediately that
res

1
z2(z −1) , 0

= a−1 = −1.
Then

|z|= 1
2
dz
z2(z −1) = 2πi res

1
z2(z −1) , 0

= −2π i.
Example 2.2 Find the residuum of the function f(z) =
1
z2n (z2 −1), z ̸= 0, 1, in the point 0.
The function can be considered as a function in w = z2, so the Laurent series expansion from z0 = 0
only contains even exponents. In particular, a−1 = 0, hence
res]

1
z2 (z2 −1)

= a−1 = 0,
and we do not have to ﬁnd the explicit Laurent series in this case.
Example 2.3 Find the residuum of the function f(z) = sin2 z
z5
, z ̸= 0, at the point z0 = 0.
The numerator sin2 z has a zero of order 2, and the denominator z5 has a zero of order 5, hence
f(z) = sin2 z
z5
has a pole of order 3 at z0 = 0.
If we choose q = 3 in Rule I, we get the following expression,
rex
sin2 z
z5
; 0

= 1
2! lim
z→0
d2
dz2
sin2 z

,
which will give us some unpleasant computations.

Then note that Rule I gives us the possibility to choose a larger q, which here is to our advantage. In
fact, if we choose q = 5 in Rule I, then
rex

Example 2.4 Find the residues at z = 0 of the following functions:
(a) z2 + 1
z
,
(b) z2 + 3z −5
z3
.
(a) It follows from
z2 + 1
z
= 1
z + z,
that
res(f; 0) = a−1 = 1.

(b) It follows from
z2 + 3z −5
z3

z + 3
z2 −5

that
res(f; 0) = a−1 = 1.
Example 2.5 Find the residues at z = 0 of the following functions:
(a) ez
z ,
(b) ez
z2 ,
(z) sin z
z4 .
(a) Here, z = 0 is a simple pole, hence by Rule I,
res(f; 0) = lim
z→0 ez = 1.
(b) Here, z = 0 is a double pole, hence by Rule I,
res(f; 0) = 1
1! lim
z→0
d
dz ez = lim
z→0 ez = 1.
(c) We get by a series expansion of the numerator sin z that

Hence

Alternatively we apply Rule I, considering 0 as a pole of at most order 4 (the order is in fact
3 < 4):

3! lim

Example 2.6 Find the residues at z = 0 of the following functions:
(a) sin z
z5 ,
(b) Log(1 + z)
z2
.
(a) Here, sin z
z5
is an even function, so
res

Alternatively we prove this by a series expansion,

z2 +

120 −· · · ,
from which we derive that
res
sin z
z5 ; 0

= a−1 = 0.
Alternatively we apply Rule I, because 0 is a pole of at most order 5 (the order is in fact 4):
res
sin z
z5 ; 0

= 1
4! lim
z→0
d4
dz4 sin z = 1
4! lim
z→0 sin z = 0.
(b) We have in a neighbourhood of 0 (exclusive 0 itself),

z2

z −z2

so
res
Log(1 + z)
z2
; 0

= a−1 = 1.
Alternatively, z = 0 is a pole of at most order 2 (its order is 1), so by Rule I,
res

z2


= 1
1! lim
z→0
d

(a)
1
z(z −1),
(b)
z
z4 + 1,
(c)
sin z
z2(π −z).
(a) The function
f(z) =
1
z(z −1)
has the simple poles 0 and 1. Then by Rule I:
res(f; 0)
=
lim
z→0 z · f(z) = lim
z→0
1
z −1 = −1,
res(f; 1)
=
lim

If we put
A(z) = z
and
B(z) = z4 + 1,
and let z0 denote any of these simple poles, then z4
0 = −1 for all four of them, and we conclude by
Rule II that

(c) Clearly, the singularity at z = π is removable, so
res(f; π) = 0.
Since
sin z
z

for z →0,
the singularity at z = 0 is a simple pole, so
res(f; 0) = lim
z→0 z · f(z) = lim
z→0

Analogously we can consider z = π as a “pole” of at most order 1. Then by Rule I,

This agrees with the fact that the function has a zero of second order at ∞, so the residuum in ∞

We have in both cases a simple pole atz = 0. As usual there are several possibilities of solutions, of

Example 2.12 Prove that the functions
(a)
1
sin z ,
(b)
1
1 −ez ,
only have simple poles in C. Find these end their corresponding residues.
(a) The poles of
1
sin z are the same as the zeros of sin z and of the same multiplicity. The function
sin z has the zeros {p π | p ∈Z}, where
lim
z⊤π
d
dz sin z = lim
z→p π cos z = (−1)p ̸= 0,
hence all poles are simple. Finally, it follows by Rule II that
res

z⊤π
1
cos z = (−1)p,
p ∈Z.
(b) The poles of
1
1 −ez are the same as the zeros of 1 −ez and of the same multiplicity. The zeros
are z = 2i p π, p ∈Z, and since
d
dz (1 −ez) = −ez ̸= 0
for every z ∈C,
all poles are simple. Hence by Rule II,
res

z→2i p π

−ez = −1,
p ∈Z.
Example 2.13 Find the residues at all singularities in C of
1
1 −cos z .
The function
1
1 −cos z has a (non-isolated) essential singularity at ∞, and otherwise only poles in C.
The poles are determined by the equation 1 −cos z = 0, thus
(1) 0 = 1 −cos z = 2 sin2 z
2,
the complete solution of which is z = 2pπ, p ∈Z. It follows from (1) that the zeros are all of second
order, hence the poles z = 2pπ, p ∈Z, of
1
1 −cos z are all of second order. We then have by Rule I

Remark 2.2 Whenever one apparently has to go through some heavy computations like the previous
ones, one should check if there should not be another easier method. Here it would have been cheating
the reader ﬁrst to bring the simple solution, so for pedagogical reasons we have ﬁrst given the standard
solution.
An alternative method of solution is the following: First note that we have for every z ∈C and
every p ∈Z that
cos((z + 2pπ) −2pπ) = cos(−(z + 2pπ) −2pπ),
which is just another way of saying that the function 1 −cos z is an even function with respect to any
2pπ, p ∈Z, so if we expand the function from some 2pπ, then it is again even. In a Laurent series
expansion of any even function all coeﬃcients a2n+1, n ∈Z, of odd indices must be equal to 0. In
particular,

Example 2.14 Find the residues at all singularities in C of sinh z
sin2 z .
Clearly, the poles are z = pπ, p ∈Z, and z = 0 is a simple pole. Any other pole z = pπ, p ∈Z \ {0}

where we to ease matters have put
(2) z2 sinh(z + pπ)
sin2 z
= a0 + a1z + · · · , |z| < π,
because z = 0 is a removable singularity, and the function has a Taylor expansion in the open disc of
centrum 0 and radius π.
The task is now to determine the coeﬃcient a1 in the Taylor expansion. It is obvious that the usual
deﬁnition with a diﬀerentiation followed by taking a limit becomes very messy. Instead we multiply
by the denominator, so (2) becomes equivalent to
z2 sinh(z + pπ) = (a0 + a1z + · · · ) sin2 z = (a0 + a1z + · · · ) · 1
2 (1 −cos 2z),
hence after insertion of the series expansions,

is 0 for z = 0 or for

This expression is the identity theorem equal to 1, if −a−3 + a−1 = 1 and the following recursion
formula holds,
n an−2 + (n + 2)an = 0,
for n ∈Z \ {−1}.
If n = 0, then a0 = 0 and a−2 is an indeterminate. Then it follows by recursion that a2n = 0 for
n ∈N0.
If n = −2, then a−4 = 0 and a−2 is an indeterminate. It follows by recursion that a−2n = 0 for
n ∈N \ {1}.
It only remains to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients of odd indices, where we have already proved that
−a−3 + a−1 = 1.

We have for the odd indices the recursion formulæ

2n + 3 a2n−3,
n ∈N,
and
a−2n−3 = −−2n + 1
−2n −1 a−2n−1,
n ∈N.
Hence by recursion for the positive, odd indices,
a2n−1 = −2n −1

2n + 1 · 2n −3

where the corresponding series is convergent for 0 < |z| < 1. This series is determined by the
coeﬃcient a−1.

corresponding to the domain of convergence given by

Since a−1 −a−3 = 1, and since the curve |z| = 1
2 lies in the set 0 < |z| < 1, we must necessarily

|z|=c
f(z) dz.
Express each of the solutions f(z) by means of elementary functions in the domain of convergence.
Hint: Consider e.g. 1
2 z f(z).
First method. Inspection. The diﬀerential equation has the singular points z = 0 and z = 1, so we
may expect that the domain is given by 0 < |z| < 1. In this set the equation can be divided by
1 −z ̸= 0. Then
z · df
dz + 1 · f(z) = d
dz (z · f(z)) = 1 + z
1 −z = −1 +
2
1 −z .
The diﬀerential equation can now be written
(3)
d
dz (z · f(z)) = −1 +
2
1 −z .
If |z| < 1, then 1 −z lies in the right half plane, so Log(1 −z) is deﬁned for |z| < 1. When we
integrate (3), we get
z · f(z) = −z −2Log(1 −z) + C,

thus
f(z) = C
z −1 −2 Log(1 −z)

0 < |z| < 1,
C ∈C.
We have now answered the last question of the example.
Since
Log(1 −z) = −


n=0

n + 1 zn+1
for |z| < 1,
it follows by insertion that

n=0

n + 1 zn = C
z + 1 +


n=1

z + 1 +


n=1

n + 1 zn,
0 < |z| < 1,

|z|=c
a−1
z
dz = 2π i res(f; 0) = 2πi a−1 = 2πi · C,

A variant is to expand

1 −z = −1 + 2

|z| < 1,

Clearly, these Laurent series have their domains of convergence 0 < |z| < 1, when C ̸= 0, and
|z| < 1 if C = 0.

Then it follows by the identity theorem that

⎩
a0 = 1,
2a1 −a0 = 1,
(n + 1)an = n an−1
for n ≥2.
We get a0 = 1 and a1 = 1, and then from the recursion formula,
(n + 1)an = n an−1 = · · · = 2 · a1 = 2,
n ≥2,
thus
an =

n + 1
for n ≥2.
Finally, we note that a−1 is an indeterminate, so
f(z) = a−1

(a) The singularities are given by z = 0, z = i and cosh π z = 0, thus πz = i π

z(z −i) is er deﬁned for all zn, and for

sinh2(π c) + cos2(π t) ≤cosh2(π c)

Line integrals computed by means of residues
Example 3.1 An analytic function f in an open annulus
Ω = {z ∈C | 0 < |z| < R},
can be described by its Laurent series:
f(z) =
+∞

n=−∞
anzn,
z ∈Ω.
1) Assume that the function is even, i.e.
f(z) = f(−z),
z ∈Ω.
Prove that an is zero for all odd values of n.
2) Find the value of the complex line integral

|z|=1
1
z sin z dz.
1) When f is even, we have in Ω,
0 = f(z) −f(−z) =
+∞

n=−∞
{1 −(−1)n} zn =
+∞

p=−∞
2a2p+1z2p+1.
We conclude from the identity theorem that
a2p+1 = 0
for p ∈Z.
2) If we put f(z) =
1
z sin z , then
f(−z) =
1
(−z) · sin(−z) =
1
z sin z = f(z),
so the integrand is an even function. Then by (1) we have in particular a−1 = 0, because −1 is
an odd index. Then

It is not a good idea in this case to use the traditional method of inserting a parametric description
and then compute. Note instead that we have inside the curve |z| = 2 (seen in its positive direction)
the two isolated singularities z = 0 and z = 1, hence by Cauchy’s residue theorem,



z→0 z f(z) = lim

(z −1)2 = 1.
Since z = 1 is a pole of second order, q = 2, we get by Rule I,

Example 3.3 Compute the line integral

|z|=2
z ez
z2 −1 dz.
In this case the integrand has two isolated singularities inside |z| = 2, namely the two simple poles
z = ±1. This gives us a hint of using Rule II. Put A(z) = z ez and B(z) = z2 −1. Then B′(z) = 2z,
and it follows by Rule II that

B′ (z0) = z0 ezp (z0)

where z0 is anyone of the singularities ±1. When we apply Cauchy’s residue theorem, we get

z ez
z2 −1 dz = 2πi{ res(f ; 1) + res(f ; −1)} = 2πi · e1 + e−1

Example 3.4 Compute the line integral

|z|=2

z4 −1 dz.
The integrand has the four simple poles 1, i, −1 and −i inside the path of integration. Then by
Cauchy’s residue theorem,

|z|=2
z
z4 dz = 2πi{res(f; 1) + res(f ; i) + res(f ; −1) + res(f : −i)}.
When we shall ﬁnd the residues in several simple poles, “more or less of the same structure”, we
usually apply Rule II. Let z0 be anyone of the four simple poles, and put A(z) = z and B(z) = z4 −1.
Then we get by Rule II,

The integrand z eaz

Of these, only z = π i lies inside the curve Ck, for all k > 0. The function is analytic outside the

Example 3.7 Compute the complex line integral

|z|=2
e2z −ez+1
(z −1)5
dz.
The integrand has a pole of at most order ≤5 at the point z = 1 (the order is actually 4) inside
|z| = 2, so we get from Rule I that

|z|=2
e2z −ez+1
(z −1)5

It is possible with some diﬃculty to get through these computations, but it is not worth it here. The
message is that we gain a lot by pretending a higher order.
Alternatively we use that we here also have
res(f ; 1) = −res(f ; ∞).
It is actually possible directly to ﬁnd res(f ; ∞), but again the computations are rather diﬃcult.
Alternatively we expand
g(z) = e2z −ez+1
ud fra z = 1.
as a series. The Taylor coeﬃcients are
g(z) = e2z −ez+1,
g(1) = 0,
g′(z) = 2 e2z −ez+1,
g′(1) = e2,
g′′(z) = 4 e2z −ez+1,
g′′(1)?3e2,
g(3)(z) = 8 e2z −ez+1,
g(3)(1) = 7e2,
g(4)(z) = 16 e2z −ez+1,
g(4)(1) = 15e2,
so the Laurent series expansion becomes
f(z) =
g(z)
(z −1)5 =

(z −1)5

0 + e2
1! (z −1) + 3e2
2! (z −1)2 + 7e2
3! (z −1)3 + 15e2

(z −1)4 + · · ·
	
.
From here we get
res(f ; 1) = a−1 = 15e2

Example 3.9 Given two polynomials P(z) and Q(z), where the degree of Q(z) is at least 1 bigger

Hint: Find e.g.. f(z) = % anzn as a Laurent series solution of (9) in Ω. It will be advantageous

Express f0(z) by elementary functions without using sums.

Example 3.11 Given the diﬀerential equation
(10)

z2 −z

f ′′(z) + (5z −4)f ′(z) + 3 f(z) = 0.
(a) Assume that (10) has a Laurent series solution f(z) = % anzn. Derive a recursion formula for
the coeﬃcients an, and prove that an = 0 for n ≤4.
(b) Then ﬁnd all Laurent series solutions of (10), and express each of them by elementary functions.
(c) Find the Laurent series solutions which have a pole at 0, determine the order of this pole and the
residuum at z = 0.
First method. Inspection. This solution method does not follow the text, so we must be careful to
have answered all questions.

When we integrate
c1
z −1, we have two possibilities:
1) In the ﬁrst case we shall check the choice of c1 Log(z −1). This function has a branch cut along
the half line ] −∞, +1[. In particular, every circle of centrum at 0 will intersect ] −∞[ at least
once. This means that Log(1 −z) does not have any Laurent series expansion in any annulus,
so we have to reject this possibility of solution.
2) The second choice is c1 Log(1 −z) of the branch cut along the half line ]1, +∞[. In this case
we already know that
c1 Log(1 −z) = −c1
+∞

n=1

n zn
for |z| < 1,
and we even get a power series expansion. Hence, we shall choose this primitive in the following.
We get by another integration that
z3f(z) = c1
z2
2 + z

+ c1 Log(1 −z) + c2,
z ∈C \ ({0} ∪[1, +∞[),
hence
f(z) = c2
z3 + c1
z3 Log(1 −z) + c1
z2 + c1
2z ,
z ∈C \ ({0} ∪[1 + ∞[).
When we insert the power series expansion, we get for 0 < |z| < 1 that
f(z)

In particular, a0 = 0 for n ≤−4, and if c2 ̸= 0, then 0 is a pole or order 3. If c2 = 0, then the
singularity at 0 becomes removable.
According to the above we have a−1 = 0, so res(f; 0) = 0 for any such solution, and we have
answered all questions with the exception of determining the recursion formula, which does not
give sense any more.

Second method. The standard method, i.e. the series method. By inserting a formal Laurent series
f(z) =

anzn
and its derivatives
f ′(z) =

n anzn−1
and
f ′′(z) =

n(n −1)anzn−2,
we get

(n+1) {(n+3)an −(n+4)an+1} zn.
Then apply the identity theorem to get the recursion formula
(11) (n + 1) {(n + 3)an −(n + 4)an+1} = 0,
for n ∈Z.
The strategy is ﬁrst to check the obvious zeros of the factors in (11).
If n = −1, then n + 1 = 0. This implies that a−1 and a0 are independent of each other, so for the
time being they may be chosen arbitrarily.
Remark 3.1 We shall later see that we get a condition on a−1, while a0 is an arbitrary
constant. However, this cannot yet be concluded. ♦.
If n ̸= −1, the recursion formula is reduced to
(12) (n + 3)an = (n + 4)an+1,
n ∈Z \ {−1}.
For n = −4, then a−4 = 0. Put bn = a−n, and derive from (12) that for n ∈N \ {1},
(n −3)bn = (n −4)bn−1.
We get by recursion for n ≥4,
(n −3)a−n = (n −3)bn = (n −4)bn−1 = · · · = (4 −4)b4−1 = 0,
so we conclude that an = 0 for n ≤−4. There is no restriction on b4−1 = a−3, so this we also
consider for the time being as an arbitrary constant.
If n = −3, then it follows from (12) that
a−2 = 0 · a−3 = 0.
We conclude that a−3 is indeed an arbitrary constant, which can be chosen freely.

If n = −2, then
0 = (−2 + 3)a−2 = (−2 + 4)a−1,
so a−1 = 0. In particular,
res(f; 0) = a−1 = 0
for every convergent series solution.
The case n = −1 has already been treated above.
If n ∈N0, then it follows from (12) that
(n + 4)an+1 = (n + 3)an = · · · = (0 + 3)a0 = 3a0,
hence
an =
3
n + 3 a0
for n ∈N0,
and we have found all coeﬃcients.
Summing up, the formal Laurent series solutions are given by
(13) f(z) = a−3
z3 + a0
+∞

n=0
3
n + 3 zn,
and it follows that the domain of convergence in general is 0 < |z| < 1 for a−3 ̸= 0 and a0 ̸= 0.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Special cases
If a−3 = 0 and a0 ̸= 0, then the domain of convergence is |z| < 1.
If a−3 ̸= 0 and a0 = 0, then the domain of convergence is C \ {0}.
If a−3 = a0 = 0, then f(z) ≡0 and the domain of convergence is C.

According to (13) (and not (14)) the Laurent series solutions which have a pole at z = 0, are given
by a−3 ̸= 0. The order is 3, and since (13) does not contain any term of the form a−1
z
(i.e. a−1 = 0
for all solutions), we have
res(f; 0) = a−1 = 0.

Assuming that


n=−∞
anzn
is a convergent Laurent series solution in a domain of the form {z ∈C | r < |z| < R} satisfying (15),
we shall ﬁnd a recursion formula for an with polynomial coeﬃcients, and also prove that an = 0, when
n ∈N.
Then ﬁnd all Laurent series solution of (15).
Hint: The general solution cannot be expressed by elementary functions.
Denote by f0(z) the Laurent series solution of (15), which also satisﬁes
f0(1) = √e,
res (f0 ; ∞) = 0.
Express f0(z) by elementary functions.
Here there are many possibilities of solution. We shall go through some of them:
1) The power series method (the standard method),
2) Transformation of the diﬀerential equation,
3) Inspection,
4) Transformation, follows by an inspection.
First method. The power series method (the standard method). Assume that the Laurent series
f(z) =



is a solution of (15) in the annulus

When we put these series into (15), we get by reduction,

(n −1) {(n −2)an−2 + an} zn.
From (16) also follows that

n(n + 1)anzn+2 +

(n + 1)an+2zn+2
=

(n + 1) {n an + an+2} zn+2.
We have now the following two “variants” of the recursion formula, which shall both be fulﬁlled
for all n ∈Z:
(n −1) {(n −2)an−2 + an} = 0,
(n + 1) {n an + an+2} = 0.
The treatment of each of the two recursion formulæ is in principle the same, so we shall only solve
one of them, namely,
(n −1) {(n −2)an−2 + an} = 0,
n ∈Z.
If n = 1, then the left hand side is identically zero, so a−1 and a1 are independent of each other.
If n ̸= 1, then the recursion formula is reduced to
(n −2)an−2 + an = 0,
n ∈Z \ {1}.
If n = 2, then a2 = 0, and since we have a leap of 2 in the indices in the recursion formula, it
follows that
a2n = 0
for n ∈N.
If n = 2p + 1, p ∈N, is odd, it follows by recursion that
a2p+1 = −(2p −1)a2p−1 = · · · (−1)p(2p −1)(2p −3) · · · 3 · 1 · a1,
and since a1 is seemingly arbitrary, we cannot immediately conclude that a2p+1 = 0, p ∈N0. The
point is that we shall only ﬁnd the convergent series solutions. Assume that a1 ̸= 0. Then it
follows from the above that a2p+1 ̸= 0, and we shall check the conditions of convergence for
(17)
+∞

p=0
a2p+1z2p+1,
where
a2p+1 = −(2p −1)a2p−1,
p ∈N.

Assuming that z ̸= 0, it follows by the criterion of quotients applied on (17) that the limiting value
of

a2p+1z2p+1
a2p−1z2p−1
 = (2p −1)|z|2
for p →+∞must be smaller that 1 for the relevant z. This is only possible for z = 0, contradicting
the assumption of z ̸= 0.
Therefore, if a1 ̸= 0, the radius of convergence is 0. Since we are only interested in series of positive
radius of convergence, it follows that a1 = 0, and hence also a2p+1 = 0 for p ∈N0, which together
with a2p = 0, p ∈N, found previously precisely gives us
an = 0
for n ∈N.
We have proved that the only possibilities of Laurent series solutions necessarily must be of the
form
f(z) =

a−nz−n =

n=0
bn · 1
zn ,
bn = a−n,
n ∈N0.
Replacing n by −n in the recursion formula for an, we get
(−n −2)a−n−2 + a−n = 0,
n ∈N0,
and since a−n−2 = bn+2 and a−n = bn, it follows that
bn+2 =
1
n + 2 bn,
n ∈N0,

bn = 1

The series is convergent for z ∈C \ {0}.
If n = 2p, p ∈N, is even, we get
(18) 2p · b2p = b2(p−1),
hence by a multiplication by 2p−1(p −1)! ̸= 0, followed by a recursion,
2pp!b2p = 2p−1 · (p −1)! b2(p−1) = · · · = 20 · 0! b0 = 10,

Only the zero solution can be extended to all of C.
The series expansion of f0(z) is convergent in C \ {0} (a neighbourhood of ∞), so the condition is
that
a−1 = −res (f0 ; ∞) = 0,
so if z ∈C \ {0}, then
f0(z) = a0 · exp

Second method. Transformation of the diﬀerential equation. Since we shall prove that

The idea is to transform (15) into an equivalent diﬀerential equation for g(w). Since

it follows from the chain rule that
f ′(z) = d

z2 g′(w),
and
f ′′(z) = 2

w g′(w) −w g′(w) −g(w) = g′′(w) −w g′(w) −g(w).
The equation (15) is in the domain C \ {0} equivalent to
(19) g′′(w) −w g′(w) −g(w) = 0,
w ∈C \ {0},
where (19) of cause can be extended to w = 0. (The restriction w ̸= 0 is only caused by the
transformation w = 1
z.) Since (19) is a diﬀerential equation of analytic coeﬃcients without singular
points, (i.e. the coeﬃcient of g′′(z) is ̸= 0 everywhere), all solutions of (19) are power series solutions
of domain of convergence C, and there are precisely two linearly independent families of solutions.
We conclude that an = b−n = 0 for n ∈N.
Put

g′(w) =

thus


n=0
(n + 1) {(n + 2)bn+2 −bn} wn = 0.
It follows from n + 1 ̸= 0 for n ∈N0 and by the identity theorem that we have the following
reduced recursion formula,
(n + 2)bn+2 = bn,
thus
bn+2 =
1
n + 2 bn,
n ∈N0.
Then we proceed as in the ﬁrst method above.
Third method. Inspection. Assume that z ̸= 0. If we divide (15) by z2, we get by a small rear-
rangement that
0 =

z2f ′′(z) + 2z f ′(z)

+ z f ′(z) −1 · f(z)
z2
= d
dz

z2f ′(z)

Hence by an integration,
(20) z2f ′(z) + f(z)
z

z ̸= 0,
c ∈C arbitrary.

When we put the Laurent series of f(z) and f ′(z) into (20), then
c =

n anzn+1+

anzn−1 =

(n−1)an−1zn+

an+1zn =
+∞

n=−∞
{(n −1)an−1 + an+1} zn.
Then we apply the identity theorem. We get in particular for n = 0,
−a−1 + a1 = c.
However, c is an arbitrary constant, so this equation only says that a−1 are a1 independent of each
other.
If n ̸= 0, then
(n −1)an−1 + an+1 = 0,
n ∈Z \ {0},
which is a third variant of the recursion formula. This is with only trivial changes solved in the
same way as by the ﬁrst method.

Fourth method. Transformation, followed by inspection. We can also inspect the transformed dif-
ferential equation (19). This gives
0 = g′′(w) −w g′(w) −g(w) = d
dw {g′(w) −w · g(w)} ,
hence by an integration,
g′(w) −w · g(w) = c.
If c = 0, we get
g(w) = a · exp
w2

,
and if c ̸= 0 we insert the series and solve the new recursion formula. The details are left to the
reader.

(a) We have clearly the three singularities z = 0, z = −1 and z = ∞, and no other.
Obviously, z = 0 is an essential singularity (see what happens when e.g. z = x →0 along the
positive and the negative real half axis, respectively).
Furthermore, z = −1 is trivially a simple pole, and ﬁnally, z = ∞is a double pole. The latter is
seen in the following way:

Example 4.28 Find the Laurent series expansion from z = 1 of
f(z) =
z + 2
(z −1)4(z + 3),
in the domain given by 0 < |z −1| < 4.
Find the residuum of f at z = 1 and z = ∞.
First method. We get by the change of variable w = z −1,

Second method. We use again the change of variable w = z −1; but then we alternatively and more
clumsy though also more realistic, decompose instead,
f(z) =
w + 3
w4(w + 4) = −1

w + 4 + 1
44 · 1
w −1

w4 .
This decomposition is in itself diﬃcult, so we only sketch the remaining part of the solution. We
use the same method as above on
−1
44 ·
1
w + 4,
for 0 < |w| < 4, as well as for |w| > 4.
And then we get all the trouble of the ﬁnal reductions.

Since f(z) has a zero of order 4 at ∞, we have
res(f; ∞) = 0.
Furthermore, z = −3 is a simple pole, so
res(f; −3) =
−1
(−4)4 = −1
256.
The sum of the residues is zero,
res(f; 1) + res(f; −3) + res(f; ∞) = 0,
hence
res(f; 1) =
1
