I thank these reviewers for their valuable suggestions and contributing remarks. Their encouraging 
words are very much appreciated.
I am impressed with Ken Bainey’s approach to integrated IT performance manage-
ment. His practical approach to accountability for results by aligning strategy to exe-
cution using a performance measurement dashboard is revealing and insightful. This 
book provides that understanding of how to apply results-based management and 
results-based budgeting to transform your IT organization into a culture of perfor-
mance excellence.
Ken Maharaj
Former CIO, Bishop’s University, Sherbrooke, Canada
This book is well written by a respected IT professional. It could serve as a textbook 
or an easy read for any professional. Although this book is written from an IT per-
spective, there is something in it that would appeal to professionals in any field of 
performance. More specifically, it could very easily be applied to project management 
world especially team performance. This book appeals to both new and experienced 
managers and project managers.
Sami Fahmy
Adjunct Professor, University of Alberta-Engineering, Alberta, Canada
An excellent body of knowledge on integrated IT performance management that inte-
grates strategic management, IT operational management and performance manage-
ment. The readers will understand how IT strategic directives align with the outputs, 
outcomes and performance measures in the IT performance measurement dashboard. 
This understanding via practical applicability will be of tremendous value to IT and 
business decision makers in managing, measuring and monitoring the delivery of IT 
services.
Qing Tan
Associate Professor, PhD, School of Computing and Information Systems, 
Athabasca University, Alberta, Canada
Already a published author, Ken has produced an amazing comprehensive col-
lection of his experiences in IT leadership, represented by an integrated IT per-
formance management framework-body of knowledge. His logical approach with 
practical “real-life” scenarios and dashboard implementation provides clarity to 
this complex discipline of performance management, which is perceived quite dif-
ferently in practice and academic research. I believe that this framework can be 
used in the design and implementation of performance management systems or 
the start of a new body of knowledge-Performance Excellence Body of Knowledge 
(PEBOK).
Eugene Sears
Former Vice-President, Information Technology Services, Ontario, Canada

Ken has created the first IT performance management body of knowledge, from my 
research and awareness. The ideas, strategies, and processes covered in this book are 
very well articulated, with innovative and practical insights into the alignment and 
integration of performance measurement results-accountability for results, processes, 
and tools. His integrated IT performance management framework provides a clear, 
consistent, and complete picture with key insight suitable for the academic, private, 
and business sectors. I believe this framework will inspire many IT leaders to assess 
and transform their performance management practices.
Stanley Boodram
Professor, DSc, American Military University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Ken’s book is a thoughtful collection of his extensive experiences and research to inte-
grating performance measurement and management practices. He is an author with 
“hands-on” IT leadership and consulting experiences. This book is a must-read for 
those responsible for managing the performance of their IT organization.
Ashvanee Bisonauth
IT Director, Government of Alberta, Canada
Writing a book about concepts such as performance management that is perceived 
quite differently in practice requires experience, research, and wisdom. Assembling 
experience, research, and wisdom into an integrated performance management 
framework of clarity, consistency, and completeness is even more challenging and 
daunting. Ken has developed a logic model to bridge strategies with practical IT 
operational execution, represented as an integrated IT performance management 
framework (IPMF-IT), with discussion of positive and negative views. I am sure 
you will reflect on your own views and experiences for improvements after reading 
this book.
Myles Diamond
Senior Performance Manager, Edgeware Inc., Alberta, Canada
IT projects are notorious for cost overruns, delays, and failure to deliver value. Ken 
Bainey has gifted the IT industry with a valuable compedium of models and insights 
for delivering outstanding returns on investments in IT.
Touraj Nasseri
Professor and IT Director, Government of Alberta, Canada
This is one of the best books on performance management that I have ever read. 
Ken Bainey has done an excellent job of illustrating accountability for results-based 
management, linking strategy with IT operational execution using an integrated IT 
performance measurement dashboard, and transforming an IT organization to a cul-
ture of performance excellence. His discussions are logical, his scenarios are real, his 
graphical representations are practical, and his writing is inspirational.
Edson Roopnarine
Specialist, IT Governance, Government of Alberta, Canada

This is a must-read for business and IT leaders who are serious about improving their 
understanding of performance management integration, accountability, transparency, 
sustainability, and transformational change, in order to optimize the utilization of IT 
resources and to enable and support organizational excellence.
Michael Frenette
Senior Partner, Sierra Systems Consultant, Nova Scotia, Canada
Almost fifty percent of major IT projects fail because of significant cost overruns, 
much longer delivery time, or because they do not meet their original objectives. One 
of the reasons for this is a lack of adequate performance management protocol, poor 
coordination, and integration during the project life cycle, and failure to implement 
appropriate monitoring and reporting systems. Far too often we have text books writ-
ten by authors who do not have enough hands-on experience regarding the subject 
matter. Ken Bainey, however, has done a marvelous job presenting his over 35 years 
of proven practical experience and expertise in Integrated IT Performance Management 
Framework, which provides a blueprint to enable the delivery of value-based IT ser-
vices by linking strategic and operational management with outcomes-driven perfor-
mance management. This book will not only benefit university students but also serve 
as an excellent reference guide for practicing IT and engineering professionals.

To my wife, Carol Bainey, who has been a partner in life since 1974, my two wonderful 
sons, Kevin and Kristian, and my brothers and sisters, whose encouragement, emotional 
support, and suggestions made this a much better book than it otherwise would have 
been. My deceased parents would have been proud of this accomplishment.

Preface
Before you start some work,
always ask yourself three questions –
Why am I doing it, What the results might be and
Will I be successful.
Only when you think deeply and
find satisfactory answers to these questions, go ahead.
—Chanakya
This book is a compilation of my extensive information technology (IT) management, perfor-
mance management, project management, enterprise architecture and applications development 
knowledge, skills, and industry experiences gained over more than 35 years as an IT professional 
in the private, public, and academic sectors in Canada and the United States. It is not intended 
to be another theoretical book on human resources performance management, as there are many 
excellent books on this topic, some of which are mentioned in the “Recommended Readings” sec-
tion at the end of each chapter. If you are in search of a book on human resources performance 
management, then this may not be the book that will interest you. The focus is within the context 
of a results-driven performance measurement and accountability framework that is outcomes-based. 
This book assumes a certain level of understanding of basic IT performance management concepts 
and theory.
However, if you are in search of real-world practical scenarios of IT performance manage-
ment practices, with a desire to obtain examples of strategic directives, accountabilities, outcomes, 
and performance measures for managing IT services, with an interest toward how performance 
management integrates with strategic and operational management, then this book may be the 
magical solution for your performance management knowledge needs. The objective of this book 
is to provide an Integrated IT Performance Management Framework (IPMF-IT)™ that integrates 
strategic, IT operational, and performance management components based on a results-driven 
performance measurement and accountability framework. This book also demonstrates the appli-
cability of this framework, within the context of the entire IT services delivery life cycle, using a 
model-centric approach. A unique and innovative approach of this model is the alignment of out-
comes measures with outputs measures, which focuses on the effectiveness and efficiencies of output 
measures to the management, measurement, and delivery of IT services.
During my 35 years as an IT professional, I have had the opportunity of experiencing both high 
excellence and less desirable practices in performance management, according to the Capability 
Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)® of the Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon 
University. Certainly, performance management requires human resource management skills, 
but these skills alone are definitely not sufficient for IT organizational excellence. The Balanced 

xx  ◾  Preface
Scorecard (BSC) framework, originally created by Kaplan and Norton in their book The Balanced 
Scorecard, published by Harvard Business School Press, identifies human resource–employee 
management as one of the four major areas of measurements required for effective and efficient 
organizational excellence. Some senior managers strongly believe that human resource manage-
ment talent is the only solution to performance management excellence to resolve the integration, 
communications, accountability, and transformation change problems internal and external to 
organizational excellence. This view that human resource management talent is the only skill 
requirement of managers is often expressed by executives and senior management staff who may 
have limited knowledge, skills, and experiences in integrated performance management processes. 
Managers who do not demonstrate the confidence and ability to apply or objectively challenge 
executive management directives and provide valuable suggestions or recommendations usually 
lack the required performance management knowledge, skills, and processes, as defined by Six 
Sigma®, The Balanced Scorecard, or similar performance measurement frameworks.
The effective applications of modern performance management principles in this techno-
logically advancing world require professional managers with generalized strategic integration, 
specialized performance measurement risk management, quality improvement, and excellent 
transformational change management skills. By measuring success through the achievement of 
outcomes rather than counting human resources efforts and activities, we will be further ahead 
in determining how outputs are aligned with outcomes to delivering the desired result. We need 
to shift from performance measures that are primarily focused on accountability for effort and 
activities to accountability for results and outcomes. We may look busy but may be producing the 
“wrong” results.
The key to solving the problems of integration, communications, accountability, and transfor-
mational change, internal and external to an organization, is the establishment and deployment 
of consistent performance measurement processes that focus on measuring results, outputs, and 
outcomes, rather than only measuring human resources efforts and activities. Employing an inte-
grated performance measurement dashboard to align strategy formulation with operations execu-
tion using outputs, outcomes, and performance measures will provide a framework for resolving 
integration and accountability issues. Effective transformational change requires an understand-
ing of people/culture, politics, process, and performance, with actions for improvements. It is not 
only about communications, but it is also about improving performance.
As a result of these real-world experiences, I decided to compile, in a single volume, the perfor-
mance management problems and challenges that I have experienced in both the highly excellent 
and less desirable performance management practices and to provide a set of real-world solutions, 
with an emphasis on the integration of strategic, IT operational, and performance management 
processes.
The real-world solutions presented in this book demonstrate a results-driven performance mea-
surement and accountability framework to managing IT services that focus on the three major 
modern performance management skills requirements of strategic integration, quality improve-
ment, and transformational change, as discussed in William A. Howatt’s book 9 Elements for 
Integrated Performance Management.
In order to progress in this dynamically changing information technology industry, we need 
to apply modern performance management talent in managing IT services using strategic integra-
tion, quality improvement, and transformational change management skills, rather than the tradi-
tional performance management skills based on measuring human resources efforts and activities 
and financials. These traditional performance measures are normally applied by human resource 
managers, financial auditors, sales executives, and business management specialists. There is no 

Preface  ◾  xxi
widely adopted performance management body of knowledge for information technology man-
agement. The Project Management Institute (PMI®) may consider adding a performance manage-
ment knowledge area to their Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK®) framework. 
To start transitioning performance management in your organization, you need to
◾
◾Establish and implement an IPMF-IT to enable accountability for achieving the results of 
IT services, to optimize resource utilization efficiency, and to ensure that IT services are 
aligned with the goals and objectives of the business while improving performance, demon-
strating value, and implementing transformational change effectiveness.
◾
◾Employ professional managers with strategic value integration, performance improvement, 
and transformation change management skills who can achieve the four major performance 
management goals of accountability, transparency, transformational change, and service 
excellence, while optimizing the utilization of IT resources—people, process, financials, and 
technology—and ensuring accountability for results.
◾
◾Educate senior and executive management on performance management integration prin-
ciples to assist them in making logical and accurate evidence-based decisions.
◾
◾Demonstrate to senior and executive management the value of performance management by 
showing them how the integration of strategic management, IT operational management, 
and performance management is essential in enabling strategic and operational performance 
improvements—organizational excellence.
The lack of standards and an integrated body of knowledge for performance management leave 
room for interpretations, flawed assumptions, and confusion. The concept of performance man-
agement is perceived quite differently in practice and academic research. It is still in the forma-
tion stages with no unified body of knowledge outlining its structure, results, processes, and 
boundaries.
This book provides that body of knowledge from the perspectives of integrating strategic, IT 
operational, and performance management results—outputs, outcomes, and processes. It uses 
a logic model to enhance performance through outcomes accountability, relationships among 
strategic directives, accountability for results, outcomes, process flows, and performance measures 
that are guided by the interrogatives: input (What is invested?), output (What is achieved?), and 
outcome, that is, impact (What is the result and what difference are we making?).
I hope that this book will provide valuable insights to functional and executive managers 
(business and IT) in their search for the elusive or magical “silver-bullet” solution to performance 
management. To readers who may view the contents as very advanced and did not gain any 
immediate value, which is unlikely, I do hope you appreciate the what, why, when, where, who, 
and how of performance management presented in this book and that the readings at least create 
some revealing, “thought-provoking” ideas. In this book, the way I attempt to make clear or create 
objectivity from subjective or confusing performance management themes is through the use of 
these English language interrogatives.

Their names are What and Why and When
And How and Where and Who

xxii  ◾  Preface
Purpose of This Book—Why
Widely published IT statistics in performance management reveal the following:
◾
◾Only 43% rated their organizational performance management systems as effective.
◾
◾There was 30% improvement in companies that chose quarterly goals in performance man-
agement over “traditional” annual reviews (2013 Bersin survey).
◾
◾“We use 2% of what we measure—the rest is CYA” (Michael Hammer).
◾
◾High performers are 44% more effective in “cascading” accountability and achieving overall 
strategic and operational objectives (PwC–2012).
◾
◾Two thirds (66%) of organizations are planning to evaluate new technologies for business 
intelligence and performance management (Ventana Research, 2013).
◾
◾On average, more than 80% of companies think their performance management processes 
need improvement—planning, budgeting, and forecasting processes seem to be especially 
problematic (BARC, BI Survey-2014).
These real-world statistics confirm the need to
◾
◾Provide accountability for achieving the results of IT services
◾
◾Optimize the allocation and utilization of IT resources
◾
◾Ensure that IT services are aligned with the goals and objectives of the business
◾
◾Improve performance, demonstrate value, and implement transformational change
◾
◾Improve decision making using evidence-based methods, measured by output and outcomes
The KPI Institute’s research “Performance Management in 2014” perceives integration as a neces-
sary and essential performance management strategy for organizational excellence.
The purpose of this book is to provide my view, from an IT industry perspective, on how to 
address these performance management issues and integration imperatives by providing a results-
driven performance measures and accountability framework of outputs, outcomes, performance 
measures, processes, practices, and real-world scenarios based on my 35 years as an IT professional 
in Canada and the United States. I compiled these practical experiences with the hope that profes-
sionals (IT and business) involved in performance management practices will understand and use 
the components of this integrated performance management framework as a valuable reference 
guide during the management and delivery of IT services.
In this book, you will
◾
◾Learn what the key results areas of an IPMF-IT™ are and how to integrate these results 
areas vertically and horizontally for strategic, IT operational, and performance management 
alignment.
◾
◾Learn how to manage, monitor, and measure IT performance results that focus on strategic 
alignment with IT operational execution using accountability for results: results-based man-
agement (RBM) and results-based-budgeting (RBB), with an integrated IT performance 
measurement dashboard and predictive performance analytics tools and technologies.
◾
◾Learn how to improve communications and enable integration, accountability, and effective 
change management, both internal and external to organizational excellence, by applying 
simple, flexible, and consistent processes using a model that integrates strategic, IT opera-
tional, and performance management practices.

Preface  ◾  xxiii
◾
◾Learn how to transform from the traditional, antiquated change management practices to a 
transformation change model of people, politics, process, and performance, as suggested in 
this performance management framework.
◾
◾Develop an appreciation for performance management best practices that I have provided 
by means of real-world examples of accountability for results-integrating strategic directives 
with outputs, outcomes, processes, and performance measures.
◾
◾Learn how strategic directives are linked with the integrated IT performance measurement 
dashboard, using the KPI Management Framework from The KPI Institute® and Kaplan 
and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard (BSC)® measurement framework.
◾
◾Understand real-world issues of performance management problems that have caused stress-
ful situations to managers and executives (business and IT), and develop an appreciation for 
the recommended solutions, using real-world scenarios.
◾
◾Understand the goals of accountability, transparency, and change management in enabling 
a results-driven performance measures and accountability framework, within the context 
of the entire IT service delivery life cycle, by integrating strategic, IT operational, and per-
formance management. This understanding will provide the needed guidance in determin-
ing accountability for results—transforming toward measuring results rather than tracking 
resources, financials, and activities, and transforming toward measuring outcomes and out-
puts rather than tracking inputs and activities.
◾
◾Obtain a comprehensive set of real-world strategic directives definitions for each functional 
area of the IT service delivery life cycle, with practical illustrations of how these strategic 
directives (strategy formulation) align with the integrated IT performance measurement 
dashboard (IT operational execution), using outputs, outcomes, performance measures, and 
Microsoft® Excel spreadsheets.
◾
◾Learn the key components of specific Industry Best Practices: COBIT®—Control Objectives 
for Information and Related Technology, ITIL®—Information Technology Infrastructure 
Library, CMMI®—Capability Maturity Model Integration, Six Sigma®—Process 
Performance Management, PMI-PMBOK®—Project Management, The KPI Institute®, 
and Kaplan and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard® performance measurement frameworks. You 
will also learn how to align and apply these frameworks with IPMF-IT during the manage-
ment and delivery of the IT services using the IT delivery life cycle process.
Who Should Read This Book
First and foremost, this book is intended as a reference source for practicing managers and execu-
tives (IT and business), whose interest is toward understanding performance management from a 
results-driven performance measurement and accountability perspective. These practicing manag-
ers will gain an appreciation for the value of integrating strategic, operational, and performance 
management in implementing accountability for results to achieve organizational excellence. It is 
also intended to serve as a performance management reference for managers, enterprise architects, 
and executive managers (in IT and business) involved in making evidence-based performance 
management decisions. This book can serve as a reference to various performance management 
stakeholders: service providers, consultants, performance managers, software application develop-
ers, business analysts, and systems architects involved in performance planning and execution and 
who wish to expand their knowledge of integrated IT performance management processes. Finally, 
this book can be used by academics and researchers in information technology management 

xxiv  ◾  Preface
courses to bridge the intellectual gap between theory and practice. The framework can be used as 
the fundamental structure in the design and implementation of performance management soft-
ware systems or the start of a new performance management body of knowledge—Performance 
Excellence Body of Knowledge (PEBOK®).
How to Use This Book
Managers and executives (IT and business) who are involved or interested in understanding results-
driven performance measurement and accountability practices at organizations and who have 
adopted the performance management integration philosophy, in whole or part, should read this book 
sequentially. The chapters have been organized logically based on the components of the IPMF-IT.
Executive managers and senior managers can limit their readings to Chapters 1 and 2, which 
provide an introduction to the output (what) and outcomes (why, impact), processes (how), and 
people resources (who) involved in implementing the IPMF-IT model. These chapters provide 
some real-world scenarios of the value of integration, accountability for results, and transforma-
tional change management for organization-wide performance management excellence, which 
executives and senior managers will appreciate. Some may perceive the information as being quite 
insightful in their elusive search for the secret of success to organizational excellence to managing 
and delivering IT services.
Performance managers, consultants, academics, and researchers should read this book sequen-
tially in order to develop a complete understanding on the what, why, how, and who of implementing 
a results-driven performance measurement and accountability framework, by integrating strategic, 
IT operational, and performance management components. They may have to tailor the IPMF-IT 
framework model to fit the context of their existing organization. Chapter 6 and Appendices A 
through F will appeal to chief information officers (CIOs) and IT leaders/managers who are search-
ing for a real-world implementation of a client-centric outsourced model that links strategic direc-
tives with IT operational execution using an integrated IT performance measurement dashboard.
Architects (IT and business), methodologists, and business analysts can limit their readings 
to Chapters 2, 6, and 7. Chapter 2 provides an introduction to the IPMF-IT model, Chapter 6 
shows how this model can be applied during the entire IT service delivery life cycle (SDLC), and 
Chapter 7 provides guidelines on how this IPMF-IT framework integrates with COBIT®, ITIL®, 
CMMI, Six Sigma®, PMBOK®, KPI Institute and Kaplan and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard to 
enable organizational excellence using the IPMF-IT framework.
Organization of This Book
Integrated IT Performance Management provides a results-driven performance measurement and 
accountability framework that is based on a specific set of strategic management, IT operational 
management, and performance management results areas that form the basis of the integrated 
(horizontal and vertical) solution. At the end of each chapter, there is a “Summary” section that 
highlights the key results-driven performance measurement concepts discussed in that chapter, an 
“Endnotes” section that further explains the meaning and context of each numbered term, and a 
“Questions to Think About: Performance Perspectives” section that provides some questions for 
the readers to objectively determine the level of performance management maturity at their com-
pany. At the end of each chapter, there are also multiple-choice questions to assist the reader in 

Preface  ◾  xxv
determining the basic understanding of the integrated IT performance management framework. 
At times, the reader may find texts or diagrams replicated throughout this book. This is intentional 
in order to provide the reader the necessary continuous and logical flow of information to enable 
a more comprehensive understanding of the foundation principles and real-world applicability.
Chapter 1, Introduction to Integrated IT Performance Management, introduces the compo-
nents of integrated IT performance management, discusses real-world problems, and provides real-
world solutions during the management, measurement, and delivery of IT services. Guidelines for 
gaining executive management support that challenge performance management myths are also 
presented to provide some helpful hints and useful insights for practising managers, especially 
those whose interests focus on achieving organizational excellence.
Chapter 2, Integrated IT Performance Management Framework, introduces the integrated IT 
performance management framework and discusses strategic management, IT operational man-
agement, and performance management components. The key accountabilities of the performance 
delivery manager are provided to demonstrate the strategic performance integration decisions 
required during the management, measurement, and delivery of IT services.
Chapter 3, Strategic Management Model, expands on the strategic management model intro-
duced in Chapter 2, discusses the results areas of the model, and provides the purpose, strategic direc-
tives, accountabilities, outputs (what), outcomes (why), process flows (how), performance model, and 
performance measures/metrics (dashboard) for each of the results areas. The accountabilities of the 
performance delivery manager discussed in Chapter 2 are further expanded to include the account-
abilities of the executive performance manager (sponsor), the performance delivery manager, and 
the performance measurement team. These roles and accountabilities demonstrate the nature of 
strategic management integration with executive sponsors, performance delivery managers, and the 
performance measurement team, during the management, measurement, and delivery of IT services.
Chapter 4, Performance Management Model, expands on the performance management 
model introduced in Chapter 2, discusses the results areas of the model, and provides the purpose, 
strategic directives, accountabilities, outputs (what), outcomes (why), process flows (how), perfor-
mance models, and performance measures/metrics (dashboard) for each of the results areas. The 
accountabilities of the performance delivery manager discussed in Chapter 2 are further expanded 
to include the roles and accountabilities of the executive performance manager (sponsor), the 
performance delivery manager, and the performance measurement team. These roles and account-
abilities demonstrate the nature of performance management integration with executive sponsors, 
performance delivery managers, and the performance measurement team during the manage-
ment, measurement, and delivery of IT services.
Chapter 5, Information Technology Operational Management Model, expands on the IT 
operational management model introduced in Chapter 2, discusses the results areas of the model, 
and provides the purpose, strategic directives, accountabilities, outputs (what), outcomes (why), 
process flows (how), performance model, and performance measures/metrics (dashboard) for 
each of the results areas. The accountabilities of the performance delivery manager discussed in 
Chapter 2 are further expanded to include the roles and accountabilities of the executive perfor-
mance manager (sponsor), the performance delivery manager, and the performance measurement 
team. These roles and accountabilities demonstrate the nature of IT operational management inte-
gration with executive sponsors, performance delivery managers, and the performance measure-
ment team during the management, measurement, and delivery of IT services.
Chapter 6, Integrated IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model, expands on the 
IT service delivery life cycle model introduced in Chapter 2, provides the strategic directives, 
discusses the outputs and performance measures for each of the IT functional areas within the IT 

xxvi  ◾  Preface
service delivery model, and provides the alignment or horizontal integration of the results areas 
with strategic management, performance management, and IT operational management using 
RACI charts. For each of the IT functional areas, the alignment of the strategic directives end 
results with the outputs and performance measures in the performance measurement dashboard 
is illustrated using matrix representations.
Chapter 7, Aligning IPMF-IT Framework with Industry Best Practices, provides insight into 
how IPMF-IT aligns with COBIT®, Six Sigma®, PMBOK®, ITIL®, CMMI®, The KPI Institute, 
and Kaplan and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard to show the integrative nature of these performance 
measurement frameworks. The strategic, IT operational, and performance management results 
areas of IPMF-IT framework are integrated with the IT functional areas or stages of IT service 
delivery life cycle using industry best practices methods and tools. The integration of the measure-
ment results areas with the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard is shown using a 
matrix representation. The functions of the performance measurement office (PMO) in provid-
ing process, standards, and technical support for integration of industry practices are discussed. 
Suggestions for transforming performance management in your organization, using the trans-
formation change model—people, politics, process, and performance—will provide very useful, 
applicable, and sustainable real-life scenarios. Finally, suggestions for CIOs and IT leaders for 
transforming to a performance management culture to enable and support IT organizational excel-
lence will provide some exciting insights, especially to those who are ready for the transformation.
The Appendices include Microsoft® Excel implementations of the integrated IT performance 
measurement dashboard for the six (6) functional areas of the IT service delivery life cycle in a 
real-life scenario. I am sure you will find the structure and analytics for evidence-based decision

Introduction to Integrated IT 
Performance Management
1.1  Introduction
Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted 
counts.
William Bruce Cameran
Sociologist
Integrated Information Technology (IT) Performance Management as defined in this book is 
the process of integrating the components of strategic management, IT operational manage-
ment, and performance management during the management, measurement, and delivery of IT 
services. The objective of this integrated process is to optimize the utilization of IT resources—
people, process, financials, and technology, using a results-driven1 performance measurement 
and accountability framework. Figure 1.1 is a conceptual representation of the three major com-
ponents of this framework that are discussed in further details throughout this book. The main 
focus is toward measuring outcomes and results rather than only measuring efforts, financials, 
and activities by counting inputs and outputs. This results-driven performance management and 
accountability framework is a set of practical strategic directives, accountabilities, outcomes, 
process flows, and performance measures, which demonstrate the integrated nature of strate-
gic, IT operational, and performance management components. The unique difference of this 
framework is the model-centric2 approach, based on outcomes and results, rather than the tra-
ditional activity-oriented method. This model-centric approach to results-driven performance 
measures and accountability framework discussed in this book is a unique innovative solution 
that can be readily applied during the management, measurement, and delivery of IT services. It 
effectively addresses the root causes of performance management major challenges—integration, 
communications, transformational change, and accountability problems internal and external to 
organizational excellence.
During my 35 years of experience in IT at various large companies in the private, public, and 
academic sectors, across Canada and United States, I have had the opportunity of working with 

2  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
senior and executive managers (IT and business) who, rightly so, stress the importance of the four 
famous performance management objectives:
	
1.	Effort allocations and utilizations (effort)
	
2.	Financial allocations and utilizations (financial)
	
3.	Work allocations and utilizations (activity)
	
4.	Performance measurement (KPI—Key Performance Indicators)
However, some of these senior and executive managers seem to measure performance based on 
these four famous performance management objectives, without any knowledge or consideration 
for strategic, operational, and performance management integration. In the majority of cases, 
these managers published performance metrics to demonstrate organizational successes, using the 
criteria of successfully meeting approved effort, financial, and activity objectives, with little regard 
for outcomes, results, and quality objectives. There was no consideration for integration, engage-
ment, alignment, accountability, measurement, and improvement.
It is sometimes a common directive by senior and executive management who have limited 
exposure to the fundamental principles of integrated performance management to emphasize the 
human resource and personal systems aspects of performance management. They have little or 
no concern for what, why, or how outcomes or results are produced to support organizational 
excellence. Managers when confronted by executive management about the desire for consistent, 
integrated, and effective performance management practices across the organization, manage to 
recommend and convince executive management that the solution is a business process modeling 
or business reengineering initiative, using an activity-based performance management process. 
After closer assessments of this recommended solution, it is evident that some managers’ per-
ception of performance management is based on activity-driven financial measures, rather than 
results-driven measures. The view of integration to optimizing the utilization of IT resources while 
improving on performance and enabling effective transformation change seems to be limited. 
There was no mention for strategic, operational, and performance management integration. In my 
view, we have just compounded the problems rather than solving the root causes of performance

management major challenges—communications, integration, accountability, and change man-
agement problems internal and external to organizational excellence.
In a majority of such cases, another business process modeling or business reengineering ini-
tiative is justified with new activity-based performance measures. There are different key perfor-
mance indicators for reducing or increasing human resource capacity, to sound impressive, and 
promote political attractiveness. The value of performance measures to generate efficiencies for 
organizational excellence through alignment to strategic and operational outcomes seem to be an 
ignored or unfamiliar concept. The end result of these performance measurement initiatives is to 
either reduce or increase human resources capacity to satisfy certain senior or executive managers’ 
ego, status, and political agenda, with the political logic to justify their decisions, using complex 
human resources policies. This is a typical case of illusions of efficiencies with nonproductive time, 
effort, and costs being applied to ineffective or wrong performance measures. The objective to 
optimize the utilization of people, process, financials, and technology resources for organizational 
excellence seems to be heading in a different direction.
The problems of the following continue to resurface, resulting in the elusive search for the 
magical “silver-bullet” solution:
◾
◾Accountability for Results
◾
◾Transparency
◾
◾Change Management
◾
◾Performance Improvement (Sustainability)
◾
◾Strategic Value Integration
◾
◾Redundant and Duplicated Efforts
Executive management perception of the causes for lack of meaningful performance measures, 
blame the rigid activity-based method—too heavy emphasis on policies and processes and too 
little emphasis on people and finance. This new directive from executive management to focus 
on people and financial aspects without alignment to outcomes or results normally evolves into a 
chaotic organizational environment with unclear outcomes, meaningless measures, confusing tar-
gets, and inconsistent processes. Managers having no documented accountability, transparency, 
and performance measures—some managers’ favorite working environment. Lack of performance 
measurement systems encourages intuitive or emotional decision-making culture. The cycle in 
search for the “silver-bullet” performance solution continues, with presentations to executive man-
agement for more people and financial resources to support the existing complex policies and 
processes.
There is no “silver-bullet” solution. These performance management problems continue to 
resurface because of the lack of strategic, operational, and performance management integration 
framework. Structure measures organizational capability (people culture, facilities, and technol-
ogy), finance measures how much services costs, process measures how services are performed, and 
outcomes measure results. This integration is necessary and essential to resolving the root causes 
of performance management challenges—integration, communications, accountability, sustain-
ability, and transformational change problems, internal and external to organizational excellence 
and IT services delivery.
There is no silver bullet.

1.2  Performance Problems: Management of IT Services
The common performance problems that managers experience during the management, mea-
surement, and delivery of IT services, as identified in Section 1.1, are further elaborated. The 
objective is to demonstrate why an integrated framework is necessary and essential to solv-
ing the root causes of performance management major challenges—integration, accountabil-
ity, sustainability, and change management problems, internal and external to organizational 
excellence.
◾
◾Accountability for Results
–	 Lack of key outcome measures, metrics, and indicators
–	 Lack of reward and recognition for performance improvements
–	 Activity-based not outcomes-based or results-driven culture
◾
◾Transparency
–	 Complex dashboards, scorecards, and benchmarking tools
–	 Lack of trust and credibility (secrecy style leadership-crisis management)
–	 Lack of effective feedback and follow-up
◾
◾Change Management
–	 Lack of understanding and communications of transformational change
–	 Lack of clear vision of desired outcomes or disagreement of what is important
–	 Lack of transformational change leadership
◾
◾Performance Improvement (Sustainability)
–	 Performance measures for decision making lacks trust and credibility
–	 Lack of consistent and integrated performance improvement strategies and plans
–	 Inconsistent understanding of measurable targets and interpretation of results
◾
◾Strategic Value Integration
–	 No alignment of performance measures to strategic and operational goals
–	 Poor communications of how IT delivers value to business areas
–	 Lack of adequate performance reporting for IT services delivery
◾
◾Redundant and duplicated efforts
–	 Measuring resources and activities rather than measuring outcomes and results
–	 Unclear accountabilities and responsibilities
–	 Inconsistent use of tools, techniques, and processes among managers
The root causes of most common performance management problems presented before focus on 
the need for a consistent and integrated results-driven performance management framework. To 
drive consistency and effective performance across an organization, the best efforts and processes 
must come together in an integrated performance management framework. Performance manage-
ment is about transforming established strategies into operational delivery of outputs, outcomes, 
and results. The objective is to optimize the utilization of people, process, technology, and finan-
cial resources. This will improve integration, communications, accountability, sustainability, and 
change management to external and internal stakeholders for organizational excellence. In order 
to effectively apply this framework, professional managers must execute these guiding principles 
during the management, measurement, and delivery of IT services, using sound strategic value 
integration, performance measurement, and transformational change management skills.3

1.3  The Increasing Demand for Performance Integration
In this advancing information economy where the interactions of strategic, operational, and per-
formance management in IT and the business areas are increasingly changing, every area of 
IT service delivery will require some form of integration. However, some managers manage IT 
services without any consideration for performance measurement integration and consistency. 
No wonder we have so many IT managers who operate using the sound impressive and politi-
cally attractive mentality. They lack adequate performance measurement knowledge and skills for 
organizational excellence, because they usually align performance management to financial and 
human resource management, without any consideration for integrated outcomes-based man-
agement, managing for results. In certain situations, the transformational leader gets the brunt 
of the blame and the reactive decision makers with crisis-style management receive praises and 
rewards for excellence, “excellence for the wrong and misleading results.” Severe accountability 
and integration challenges continue to manifest itself within the organization. This ineffective 
performance management cycle continues, without any sound reasoning for the root causes of 
these performance management problems and without any real corrective action for performance 
improvements.
The KPI Institute™ for Performance Management has published performance management 
integration guidelines in their publication Performance Management in 2013, which is widely 
published internationally, within the performance management discipline. COBIT5®—Control 
Objectives for Information and related Technology— from ISACA®–IT Governance Institute has 
published a business framework for the governance and management of enterprise IT processes. 
Lean Six Sigma® is a set of tools and methods for process improvement, originally developed 
by Motorola. Carnegie Mellon University–Software Engineering Institute (SEI)3 has published 
the Capability Maturity Integrated Model (CMMI®) to improve IT development process, con-
trols, and outcomes. ITIL®—Information Technology Infrastructure Library—from the UK 
Government has published ITIL framework to improve IT operational processes and controls, 
using an IT service management life cycle. PMI®—Project Management Institute—has pub-
lished PMBOK to improve project management practices. However, there is no widely accepted 
published performance management framework that is integrated, results-driven, outcomes-based, 
model-centric,4 and which integrates strategic, operational, and performance management across 
the entire IT services delivery life cycle. This framework also provides real-world practical sce-
narios on what, why, and how these three major components—strategic, operational, and per-
formance management integrate during the management, measurement, and delivery of IT 
services. It is based on outcomes, outputs, process flows, and accountabilities to improve strate-
gic value alignment, evidence-based decision making, and to optimize resource utilization for 
organizational excellence.
Managing the delivery of IT services cannot be accomplished in isolation. It requires an inte-
grated understanding of strategic, operational, and performance management components. We 
should understand how we are doing, how to measure, how to improve, and how successful we 
are in delivering our strategic and operational outcomes. We must provide value to internal and

external stakeholders to demonstrate organizational excellence. The requirements for performance 
management integration in this modern technologically advancing world cannot be met, with 
the crude integration methods of the early days of information technology. Innovative integration 
methods, such as the framework presented in this book, must be effectively applied and communi-
cated. This will significantly improve the way strategic management is aligned with IT operational 
management and performance management, to ensure successful delivery of IT services during 
the entire IT services delivery life cycle.
Traditional Balanced Scorecard implementations often fail to deliver anticipated ben-
efits because they are not integrated with performance management processes, par-
ticularly those executed at the strategic and operational level.

1.4  Role of Executive Management
Effective integrated IT performance management requires many executive level management 
talents and skills. Integrated IT performance management is defined in this book as: “The 
process of integrating strategic management, IT operational management and performance 
management components during the management, measurement and delivery of IT services.” 
The objective is to optimize the utilization of IT resources—people, process, financial, and 
technology. Executive management will use the integrated performance measurement sys-
tem for performance monitoring-optimizing the utilization of IT resources, strategic value 
integration, and evidence-based decisions making to improve organizational excellence. The 
accountabilities and decision-making structures of executive management for strategic, opera-
tional, and performance management must be established and communicated to drive integra-
tion and effective performance management using an integrated performance management 
framework.

1.5  A Real-World Problem Scenario: Measuring 
Major IT Program
A senior business manager at a large company mentioned:
We seem to be experiencing several major challenges in understanding the value we 
are obtaining for the investments we are making towards the delivery of a major IT 
program. I hired a major outsourcing firm who spent extensive amount of dedicated 
efforts to documenting strategic and operational business process flows but cannot 
justify the value of such extensive documentation. They documented strategic and 
operational process flows, detailed plans and schedules at the activity level with mea-
sures and forecasts for financial and human resource efforts that are gradually becom-
ing meaningless and misleading. Enormous amount of documentation was produced 
which looked impressive but lack integration and consistency, resulting in the demand 
for additional IT and business resources. We went through endless information tech-
nology performance iterations with unclear accountabilities and meaningless perfor-
mance measures. The performance management process focused on counting inputs 
and outputs, with continuous justifications for adding more and more business and 
IT processes by several enthusiastic performance measurement teams. The reactive 
environment seems to be the normal mode of operations for this performance mea-
surement team, with re-occurring requests for approvals appearing on my desk, for 
additional process managers and specialists in IT and business areas. Executive man-
agement needed proper justification on the continuous request for resources, and my 
frustration level seems to have reached that limiting point.
My heightened frustration resulted in a decision to sign a contract with an “expert” 
performance management consulting firm to assist executive management in under-
standing the strategic value of this major business-oriented IT program. The overall 

8  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
goal was to optimize the utilization of strategic and operational business and IT 
resources. The result was to improve the performance management communications, 
integration, sustainability, accountability and change management challenges, inter-
nal and external to the organization. My search was for an integrated solution, with 
the hope that this IT consulting company will deliver a sustained solution to this 
performance management challenge.
This performance management consulting firm, over-excited with this opportunity, 
produced more extensive documentation based on their “self-proclaimed” unique per-
formance management methodology. This resulted in additional consulting resources, 
regular daily non-productive meetings, and more detail disintegrated documentation. 
The performance team, over-excited about the new performance management meth-
odology, adopted the consulting firm’s “fresh-start” approach with great respect and 
enthusiasm. The result was another set of similar financial performance measures, 
metrics and indicators that were activity-based rather than outcomes-based. The new 
performance management documentation was re-packaged with the consulting com-
pany’s logo. The consulting company’s confidentiality and copyrights terms appeared 
on the title page of each document.
The original problem of the lack of accountability, consistency and integration still 
prevails, with unclear linkages to understanding performance management, opera-
tional management, and strategic management integration. To add to this existing 
performance management chaos, the performance measures report now contain addi-
tional set of financial performance metrics and indicators at the detailed activity level, 
mainly to justify the need for five more senior consulting resources. This consulting 
firm seems to have re-packaged the inefficiencies of last year’s performance measures 
into their report, with historical financials and employees measures incorporated in a 
“Victorian-novel” style documentation.
A polished report from this consulting firm recommended a solution to the prob-
lems, which required an organizational and cultural change. This change recom-
mended the establishment of two separate performance management groups. One 
group to support the strategic management function and the next group to support 
the operational management function. This recommendation suggested the utilization 
of additional business and IT resources that escalated the budget to a level that was 
difficult to justify to executive management.
The search for the elusive integrated solution continues, and my position seems 
to be in more severe trouble, with valid excuses to executive management becoming 
non-existent. The original performance questions relative to development of this IT 
program of: “How we are doing?”; “Are we doing the right things?” “Are we getting 
the right results?”; “Are we getting the value?”, still remain unanswered with more 
uncertainties and complexities. What should I do to get this major IT-business pro-
gram back to an acceptable budget, accountability for results within the performance 
constraints level? What approach or technique should I apply?” These questions still 
remain unsolved. There are now additional resources and excessive complex perfor-
mance measures, as a result of this desperate search for that elusive integrated solution.
I finally realized that there is no magical integrated solution, so decided to approach 
this performance management accountability, inconsistency and disintegration prob-
lems using the original internal performance team. The search for a senior program 
manager started. This individual must have experience with strategic management, 

Introduction to Integrated IT Performance Management  ◾  9
operational management and performance management integration skills. He/she 
must have expertise in strategic value integration-people, process, financials, tech-
nology and transformational change-people, politics, process, and performance. I 
decided to search for an individual solution, after considering many risk factors. I 
believe that the risk impact in this case is small, and eventually hope to address these 
performance management challenges with this senior program manager. My expec-
tation is that this individual has attained extensive practical integration, transfor-
mational change, performance measurement and risk management skills, on similar 
business-IT programs.
This problem scenario, experienced at this organization, shows some major challenges to IT per-
formance management that often occur, internal and external to this organization.
◾
◾Committing to financial performance measures, whether or not strategic, operational, and 
performance measures can be effectively integrated with risks and quality objectives.
◾
◾Establishment of separate performance management groups: one for strategic manage-
ment and one for operational management, with each group reporting on financial and 
nonfinancial measures based on historical financial results rather than understanding 
how nonfinancial performance measures influence financial results, using predictive 
analytics.
◾
◾Strategic management is accountable for establishing the financial measures with little or 
no integration with the operational measures—internal processes, employees, and custom-
ers. Operational management is accountable for service delivery with little or no mean-
ingful performance measures. Human resource managers get involved during the annual 
employee’s performance appraisals. Accountants get involved during the annual budget-
ing process. Integration exists in some illusionary constructs at the start and ending of 
the annual budgeting and employee performance appraisals processes. This approach may 
work well for those “self-serving and egoistic” managers who strive on subjective mea-
sures to satisfy their political agendas. In most cases, accountability for results is rarely 
demonstrated, which increased the need for a more integrated approach to enable effec-
tive strategic value integration and transformational change, using sound risk and quality 
management processes.
◾
◾Assignment of a performance manager who lacks integration, transformational change, and 
performance measurement skills.
◾
◾Addressing the communications issue with excessive performance management “status 
meetings,” illusionary accountability, and secrecy style management.
◾
◾Meaningless and ambiguous measures and metrics with no baseline for improvements or 
how to interpret performance results.
◾
◾Disregard for the root causes of performance management challenges—communications, 
integration, sustainability, accountability, and transformation change.
◾
◾Performance managers disregard for measurable responsibilities and accountabilities for 
results, to show how the results of the performance team align with the goals and strategic 
directives.
◾
◾Performance measures, metrics, and indicators based on counting activities, inputs, and 
outputs, without regard for a Performance Management Structure (PMS).5
◾
◾Ineffective utilization of performance management tools such as scoreboard or dashboard, 
even by the “so-called” expert performance management consulting firm.

10  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
◾
◾Separation of strategic management, operational management, and performance manage-
ment functions, with each group happily performing their individual responsibilities, with-
out any overall direction or vision for integration—a recipe for chaos.
◾
◾Searching for that secret magical solution in a culture of subjective measures and reactive 
decision making, without sound analysis on the root causes of the problems.
◾
◾Emphasis on human resources and financial performance management with little or no 
consideration for integration of strategic, operational, and performance management results.
The real secret of magic lies in the performance.
David Copperfield
A consultant is someone who saves his client almost enough to pay his fees.
Arnold H. Gloasow
The solutions discussed in Section 1.6 demonstrate the value of strategic, operational, and perfor-
mance management integration to solve the root cause–performance problems, resulting from the 
lack of accountability, communications, and integration of these major components. This real-world 
practical solution discussed in the next section addresses most of the critical problems presented 
before. It should provide some revealing and useful observations and lessons learned for those prac-
ticing performance managers, senior and executive management staff involved in measuring and 
improving IT programs using performance data, and whose interest is toward integration.
We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.

1.6  A Real-World Solution Scenario: Measuring 
Major IT Program
This section highlights the performance management solution that was implemented, with a high 
degree of success, at this major organization, in solving the real problem scenario discussed in the 
earlier section. This major business-oriented IT program was managed and delivered by a newly 
established Business Systems Group (BSG) consisting of both IT and business resources. IT was 
responsible for technology infrastructure support (hardware, systems software, and network). The 
BSG was responsible for the business process and business applications software development and 
support. The key performance management principles that guided this results-driven solution are 
presented in this section as follows:
◾
◾Performance Management Organizational Structure
◾
◾Performance Management Accountabilities
◾
◾Performance Management Structure (PMS) model and hierarchy
◾
◾Performance Measurement Dashboard that aligns with PMS
The objective of this section is to provide the real-world solution that was successfully delivered to 
solve the accountability, inconsistency, and disintegration problems discussed in the problem scenario. 
This real-world practical solution is based on a “results-based” Performance Management Structure 

Introduction to Integrated IT Performance Management  ◾  11
(PMS). The dashboard-based solution to integrating strategic, operational, and performance manage-
ment results are provided to demonstrate an example of a real-world practical and effective utiliza-
tion of a performance management dashboard. Establishing order and structure to this disintegrated 
performance environment required the use of a Performance Measurement Dashboard by perfor-
mance management professionals with strategic value integration, transformational change, and per-
formance measurement skills.
◾
◾Performance management organizational structure presented in Figure 1.2, demonstrates 
the integration of strategic management, performance management, and operational man-
agement from a performance management organizational perspective. At this corporation, 
the newly formed Business Systems Group was responsible for performance management—
measurement, delivery, and improvement of the IT program. IT operational management 
was responsible for technology infrastructure direction, development and support for hard-
ware, system software including data base management system and network configuration. 
Strategic management was mainly responsible for providing strategic alignment and busi-
ness strategies internal and external to the major IT program and also performing accep-
tance testing, end-users training, and transformational change management.

1.6.3  Performance Management Structure
The objective of this section is to present the Performance Management Structure (PMS) that 
was used as the key guiding principle in managing and delivering this major IT program, within 
the context of the overall IT service delivery life cycle. This performance management structure 
aligns with Six Sigma process improvement using Deming’s “PDCA” Cycle7 and COBIT Governance 
Objectives and supports the results-driven performance management and accountability frame-
work, as presented in this book. The fundamental principles and guiding definition of PMS is 
defined in this book in accordance with Kaplan and Norton’s8 research as: “A results-oriented 
group of performance measures that aligns formulated goals and strategic directives into out-
comes, outputs, performance measures and results. Each descending level represents an increasing 
detailed definition of the performance results.”
The core measures of any performance management structure, whether or not the industry is 
public, private, or academic, consist of employee—HR, customer, operational (Internal Processes, 
Services, and Technology), and financial measures to support both business and IT processes. 
The key IT service areas that support the implementation of these core measures consist of gover-
nance and planning, architecture, project portfolio management, and applications/technology services 
to ensure that these measures fit within the context of the IT service delivery life cycle. Deming’s 
PDCA performance management life cycle is used to guide the measurement of the major IT ser-
vice delivery life cycle, using a more iterative and orderly performance management progression, 
as shown in Figure 1.3.

This PMS is a key foundation principle within this manuscript that is used to demonstrate the 
model-centric and results-oriented approach to managing, measuring, and improving the delivery 
of IT services.
1.6.4  Performance Management Structure Hierarchy
The objective of this section is to show the PMS hierarchy, presented in Figure 1.4, which formed 
the basis for the development of the PMS structure. It is based on Kaplan and Norton’s8 foundation 
principles for developing a balance scorecard to ensure effective measurement of organization’s 
goals and strategies. These principles are sound and have been applied successfully on various 
IT performance programs. First, specify and break down the goals and strategic directives into 
valuable and measurable outcomes and outputs for each performance measurement area. Second, 
establish performance measures, metrics and indicators to each of the outcomes and outputs. 
Finally, interpret the results of the graphs and charts to measure and improve how an organization 
is delivering its strategic and operational outcomes.

1.6.5  Performance Measurement Dashboard
The real-world dashboard that was used as the tool to manage, measure, and improve this major 
IT program is presented to demonstrate the performance management tool implementation of this 
performance management foundation structure. Figure 1.5a through 1.5g shows the tool-based 
solution to the PMS solution and the PMS hierarchy presented in Figures 1.3 and 1.4, respec-
tively. The solution presented for project portfolio management service area shows the measures 
at a point in time for managing the delivery of this major IT program. Appendices A through F 
contain the detailed measures for the entire IT services functional areas as specified in the PMS. 
The strategic directives and outcomes are aligned with the performance measures and the roles 
and accountabilities presented in Section 1.6.2, using the performance management information 
system (PMIS) repository. This integrated alignment provided an effective means to optimizing: 
staffing—human resource, spending—financials, supporting/using—operational, and satisfying—
customer through internal measures or external benchmarking. This results-based solution can be 
easily applied to the implementation of any major performance improvement program, as a result 
of the flexibility, consistency, integrity, maintainability, and reusability of this unique, simple, 
practical, and innovative results-based performance management structure.
Figure 1.5a through c shows the performance measurement areas, outputs, performance mea-
sures, and results for Project Portfolio Management outcomes/output—Operational measures, 
specified in the PMS. In this version of the performance management dashboard, the performance 
measurement areas were integrated with the strategic directives, outputs, performance measures, 
and results to show how these performance measures are integrated and aligned with the goals 
and strategic directives.

26  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
During my 35 years in information technology in Canada and United States, in the private, 
public, and academic sectors, I have had the opportunity to experience similar types of perfor-
mance management issues and concerns at various companies. In this case, executive manage-
ment is mostly concerned with understanding how to manage, measure, and improve the entire 
IT delivery services, rather than the IT program performance problems discussed previously in 
Section 1.6. The performance management problems discussed here require a much more compre-
hensive integrated solution than the IT program performance solution mentioned earlier.
An Executive Manager (business and IT) from a large organization mentioned:
We are in urgent need to establish an integrated performance management plan to 
measure the results against the plan and to understand the value we are obtaining for 
the investments we are making towards the management and delivery of IT services. 
How to quantify and verify investments results? Executive management made a deci-
sion to undergo a massive restructuring of the company’s IT strategic and operational 
processes. We contracted a consulting company with extensive IT industry experience 
to re-engineering our current business and IT processes, perform a gap analysis, rec-
ommend proposed business and IT processes and develop an integrated performance 
plan. This integrated performance plan should include new business and IT processes, 
performance measures and expected results. It should align with strategic and opera-
tional goals and various industry benchmarking recommendations to determine the 
value we are obtaining for the delivery of IT services. We were planning to use this 
integrated performance plan as a framework for managing, measuring and delivering 
IT services and to optimize the utilization of IT resources. This consulting company 
interviewed various executive managers, and provided comprehensive documentations 
of the current and proposed IT and business related processes, which were approved 
in principle by executive management. However, the performance management plan 
included complex and misleading performance measures. The expectation to use this 
performance management plan as a framework for managing, measuring and deliver-
ing IT services and to optimize the utilization of IT resources was quite unsatisfactory 
and disappointing.
Senior business and IT managers responsible for the deployment of the newly 
established processes (IT and business processes) viewed this re-engineering and 
performance management solution as theoretical and impractical. They decided on 
another approach- to deliver another reengineering and performance management 
plan, using in-house staff and a local consulting firm. This local consulting firm, with 
business process re-engineering expert knowledge, was contracted to deliver a perfor-
mance management solution with support from the client’s business groups. The end 
result was another set of voluminous documentation of the current and future business 
processes, in a new format and structure, with contents similar to those of the previous 
consulting company’s recommendations. The contents of the deliverables produced 
were at such a detailed activity level that executive management was having great 
difficulties in understanding the concepts and applicability. A performance manage-
ment plan was produced in the form of a performance schedule with duplicated and 
redundant business and IT performance measures and inconsistent tasks/activities. 
The performance plan emphasized the requirements for extensive business and IT 
resources, without any quantifiable economic justification.

Introduction to Integrated IT Performance Management  ◾  27
We, executive management, unsatisfied with the results produced so far, decided to 
hire an “expert” IT performance management consulting firm to establish yet another 
integrated performance management plan. The scope of this contract was modified 
from the previous engagement and stated, “To optimize the utilization of business and 
IT resources and to improve the performance management communications report-
ing- internal and external to the delivery of IT services.” We contracted a performance 
management firm with “expert” knowledge of business processes, performance man-
agement and IT processes. A new set of jargon was now introduced to include Six 
Sigma, COBIT, ITIL, PMBOK and CMMI performance management frameworks 
that compounded the existing integration, communications, accountability, and trans-
formational change problems. The desperate search for the “silver-bullet” integrated 
solution has started again, with the hope that this IT performance management con-
sulting company will magically deliver the solution to this performance management 
problem. The expectation was that this consulting company will re-use the documen-
tation produced so far, and this time around, we hope to make huge progress.
This IT performance management consulting firm, rightly so, suggested the use of 
well-defined set of industry standard frameworks. The end-result was a set of exten-
sive performance management models that aligned with various industries standard 
frameworks resulting in their “self-proclaimed” unique performance measurement and 
improvement methodology. The performance plan to implement this unique method-
ology required additional consulting resources, regular daily non-productive status 
meetings, and more detailed disintegrated performance measures. The performance 
team, again overly excited about the new performance measurement and improvement 
methodology, adopted the consulting firm “fresh-start” approach with great respect 
and enthusiasm. The result was another set of similar strategic, operational, and per-
formance management processes, re-packaged with the consulting company’s logo. 
The consulting company’s confidentiality and copyrights terms appeared on the title 
page of each document.
The problem scenario discussed in Section 1.5, seems to be repeating itself, but to a much larger 
extent. This company has already spent extensive amount of efforts devoted to documenting busi-
ness processes, IT strategies, and performance management measures, metrics, and indicators, 
but cannot justify the value of such extensive documentation. They had performance plans and 
schedules with financial performance measures, metrics, and indicators that were activity based 
rather than outcomes based, which were gradually becoming unmanageable, meaningless, and 
misleading measures. Enormous amounts of documentation were produced which again looked 
impressive. It lacked integration and consistency, resulting in the demand for additional IT, busi-
ness, and performance management resources. This company seems to be going through another 
sort of performance measurement explosion crisis, but now to a larger extent, with unclear roles 
and accountabilities. Business and IT performance measures were delivered and redelivered as 
different versions, with performance plans and schedules managed by several enthusiastic and 
reactive performance management teams. The familiar headless chicken environment seems to be 
the performance team mode of operations, with reoccurring requests for approval appearing on 
the desks of executive management, for additional business and IT performance specialists and 
managers.
Now, a frustrating message, similar to the concerns expressed in Section 1.5, came from an IT 
executive, having a performance management perspective:

28  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
The original requirement for a consistent and integrated performance management 
plan to measure the results against the plan is still unresolved. Also, the need to under-
stand the value we are obtaining for the investments we are making towards the man-
agement and delivery of IT services is still non-existent. The linkages to performance 
management, operational management and strategic management goals and strategies 
are still unclear. An unexpected additional legal contracting issue as a result of the 
consulting firm confidentiality and copyrights terms appearing on the title page of 
each document needs resolution. To add to the existing performance measurement 
complexities, the performance management plan contains an additional set of finan-
cial performance measurement activities. The performance contract is now way over 
the original budget and behind schedule, with performance measures for activities, 
financial and human resources effort being addressed with “Victorian-novel” style 
documentation. A polished report from the consulting firm recommended a solution 
to the problems, which required organizational and cultural changes. This change 
recommended the establishment of two separate performance management groups. 
One group to support strategic management functions and the next group to support 
IT operational management functions. This recommendation suggested the need for 
additional business and IT resources that escalated the performance program budget 
to a level that was difficult to justify to executive management.
The search for the “silver-bullet” solution continues, and this IT executive seems to be in more 
severe trouble, with valid excuses to executive management becoming nonexistent. The original 
performance questions relative to measuring IT delivery services of “How we are doing?” “Are we 
doing the right things?” “Are we getting the right results?” “Are we getting the value?” still remain 
unanswered with more uncertainties and complexities. “What should I do to quantify, verify, and 
report on the value of IT investments?” “How can I ensure accountability for results and manag-
ing for outcomes?” “What approach or technique should I apply?” These questions also still remain 
unsolved, but now with additional resources and excessive complex performance measures, as a 
result of this desperate search for that elusive integrated solution.
This IT executive finally realized that there is no “silver-bullet” integrated solution, so decided 
to approach this “performance measurement chaos,” inconsistency, disintegration, and unaccount-
ability problems with the same IT performance management-consulting firm, and search for a 
senior performance manager. This individual must have experience with strategic management, 
operational management and performance management integration skills. He/she must have exper-
tise in strategic value integration—people, process, financials, and technology and transformational 
change—people, politics, process, and performance. I decided to search for an individual solution, 
after considering many risk factors. I believe that the risk impact in this case is small, and eventually 
hope to address these performance management challenges with this senior performance manager. 
This individual had attained extensive practical integration, transformational change, and perfor-
mance measurement skills, in managing, measuring, and improving similar IT delivery services.
This problem scenario shows some of the major performance management challenges that 
often occur, similar to those discussed in Section 1.5:
◾
◾Committing to financial performance measures, whether or not strategic, operational, and 
performance measures can be effectively integrated with risks and quality objectives.
◾
◾Establishment of separate performance management groups for strategic management and 
operational management. Each group reporting on financial and nonfinancial measures 

Introduction to Integrated IT Performance Management  ◾  29
based on historical financial results rather than understanding how nonfinancial perfor-
mance measures influence financial results, using predictive analytics.
◾
◾Performance management is usually aligned to financials and employee measures. What 
about operational efficiencies/effectiveness? What about customer end-user satisfaction? 
What about the integration with strategic direction?
◾
◾Strategic management is accountable for establishing the financial measures with little or 
no integration with the operational measures—internal processes, employees, and custom-
ers. Operational management is accountable for service delivery with little or no mean-
ingful performance measures. Human resource managers get involved during the annual 
employees performance appraisals and accountants get involved during the annual bud-
geting process. Integration exists in some illusionary constructs at the start and end of 
the annual budgeting and employee performance appraisals processes. This approach may 
work well for those “self-serving and egoistic” managers who strive on subjective mea-
sures to satisfy their political agendas. In most cases, accountability for results is rarely 
demonstrated, which increased the need for a more integrated approach to enable effec-
tive strategic value integration and transformational change, using sound risk and quality 
management processes.
◾
◾Assignment of a performance manager who lacks integration, transformational change, and 
performance measurement skills.
◾
◾Addressing the communications issue with excessive performance management “status 
meetings,” illusionary accountability, and secrecy style management.
◾
◾Meaningless, ambiguous, and misleading measures and metrics with no baseline for 
improvements or how to interpret performance results.
◾
◾Disregard for the root causes of performance management challenges—communications, 
integration, accountability, sustainability, and transformation change.
◾
◾Performance managers disregard for measurable responsibilities and accountabilities for the 
results, to show how the results of the performance team are aligned with the goals and 
strategic directives to maximize the value and return of IT investments.
◾
◾Performance measures, metrics, and indicators based on counting activities, inputs, and 
outputs, without regard for a PMS.
◾
◾Ineffective utilization of performance management tools such as scoreboard or dashboard, 
even by the “so-called” expert performance management consulting firm.
◾
◾Separation of strategic management, operational management, and performance manage-
ment functions, with each group happily performing their individual responsibilities, with-
out any overall direction or vision for integration—a recipe for chaos.
◾
◾Searching for that secret magical solution in a culture of subjective measures, hierarchical 
positional powers, and political benchmarking, without clear understanding of the root 
causes of the problems.
◾
◾Emphasis on human resources and financial performance management with little or no 
consideration for integration of strategic, operational, and performance management 
results.
The solutions discussed in Section 1.8 demonstrate the value of strategic management, operational 
management, and performance management integration to solve the root cause–performance 
problems, resulting from the lack of accountability, transformational change, communications, 
and integration of these major components. It is worth mentioning that similar type chal-
lenges were discovered during the management, measurement, and improvement of the major 

30  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
business–IT program and the management and measurement of IT delivery services. However, 
the integrated solution to measuring IT delivery services is much more complex than measuring 
a major business–IT program. This will require performance managers with excellent skills in 
strategic value integration, specialized transformational change management, and sound perfor-
mance measurement—risk/quality—to ensure successful measurement and improvement for the 
delivery of IT services.

This section introduces the recommended integrated IT performance management solution 
presented in this book, to solve the problems discussed in Section 1.7—Real-World Problem 
Scenario—managing, measuring, and improving IT delivery services. This recommended 
solution is a compilation of my extensive performance management experiences incorporated 
into a single volume. Various successful scenarios and lessons learned from less successful sce-
narios were modified accordingly to reflect modern performance management principles and 
applicability.
The model-centric approach to managing, measuring, and improving IT delivery services 
introduced in this section, represents the foundation models, detailed in this book, as follows:
◾

◾
◾Chapter 3—Strategic Management Model
◾
◾Chapter 4—Performance Management Model
◾
◾Chapter 5—Information Technology Operational Management Model
◾
◾Chapter 6—Integrated IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model
◾
◾Chapter 7—Aligning IPMF-IT with Industry-Related Performance Frameworks
Chapter 2—Integrated IT Performance Management Framework (IPMF-IT) introduces the inte-
grated IT Performance Management Model and discusses the strategic management, performance 
management, and IT operational management components of this model. It provides the roles 
and accountabilities of the performance delivery manager during the management, measurement, 
improvement, and delivery of IT services.
Chapter 3—Strategic Management Model expands on the Strategic Management Model intro-
duced in Chapter 2, discusses the components of the model, and provides purpose, roles and 
accountabilities, and results—outcomes/outputs, process flows, and performance measures, for 
each of the components.
Chapter 4—Performance Management Model expands on the Performance Management Model 
introduced in Chapter 2, discusses the components of the model, and provides purpose, roles and 
accountabilities, and results—outcomes/outputs, process flows, and performance measures, for 
each of the components.

Chapter 5—Information Technology Operational Model expands on the IT Operational 
Management Model introduced in Chapter 2, discusses the components of the model, and pro-
vides purpose, roles, and accountabilities, and results—outcomes/outputs, process flows, and per-
formance measures, for each of the components.
Chapter 6—Integrated IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model expands on the 
IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model introduced in Chapter 2 and provides the 
Strategic Directives for the IT functional areas and the alignment or horizontal integration with 
Strategic Management, IT Operational Management and Performance Management, based on 
the IT Service Delivery Life Cycle stages.
Chapter 7—Aligning IPMF-IT results with Industry-Related Performance Frameworks—Six

outcomes with industry-related performance frameworks” is provided to show the integra-
tive nature of these outputs/outcomes and the alignment with the Integrated IT Performance 
Management Framework presented in this book. This framework formed the basis to understand-
ing the alignment or horizontal integration with industry-related performance frameworks, based 
on the IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model.
1.9  Gaining Acceptance for Performance Integration
Misunderstandings usually occur because of differences in thinking preferences
James P. Lewis
One of the major obstacles that performance managers often have to overcome is the lack of 
senior management support for modern integrated performance management practices using a 
results-driven performance measures and accountability framework. Applications of integrated 
performance management practices that require a culture of accountability for results can be a 
challenging experience. This can be compounded when senior management fails to recognize the 
need for, or even worst agrees in principle to performance management integration, but questions 
the need for integrating financial, human resources, customer, and operational measures. The 
result is the classical performance managers’ balancing act of standing up for what they believe 
is correct and risk losing their position or hesitantly supporting senior management decision. 
The decision is usually to maintain the “status quo” and continue with the nonintegrated, incon-
sistent, and command and control approach to sound impressive, increase politically attractiveness 
with wrong, meaningless, and misleading performance measures.
The integrated IT performance management framework discussed in this book can only 
be effective when properly applied with adequate support from senior management. The objec-
tive of this section is to present some guiding principles to assist performance managers in 
obtaining management support for execution of this integrated IT performance management 
framework.
Some senior business and IT management professionals resist performance integration culture 
and practices—accountability for results. These methods require managing for outcomes that 
demands consistency, standardization, and transparency, which may block the progress, ambition, 
and ego of individual “empire builders” who usually strive on gaining power through “single-
view” management.

32  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
Often the arguments against performance management integration, as defined in this book, 
by senior business and IT management professionals are formulated from a number of myths, 
flawed assumptions, and twisted interpretations that are challenged throughout this book.
	
1.	Myth: These methods are all theoretical; in this company things are done differently. Models, 
Results-Based Management (RBM) processes, and outcomes are theoretical, and best suited 
for the academic environment.
	
	 Reality: Any effective method requires theory or principle, as the foundation for execu-
tion; otherwise, chaos will result. Models are abstractions of reality. Outcomes measure 
results.
	
2.	Myth: Results-driven integrated performance management framework is NOT different 
than our current performance management processes. The solution is executive manage-
ment commitment NOT enhanced performance management processes.
	
	 Reality: I agree executive management commitment is necessary. However, no executive 
management will commit to any process that does not demonstrate explicit linkage and value 
to strategic, business and IT management processes. Even if commitment is gained, it has 
the famous quote: “Agreement in Principle.” Current performance management processes, 
especially those for human resources and finance are activity-based (effort and account), 
historical results and do not align to company’s goals and strategic directives. Results-driven 
performance measures are outcomes-based, predictive analytical results aligned to compa-
ny’s goals and strategic directive that enable accountability for results. Many human resource 
measurement cultures are controlled-based and usually result in negative judgmental mea-
surement and accountability during performance reviews.
	
3.	Myth: Senior IT Managers should NOT be Performance Managers.
	
	 Reality: Some senior IT and business managers firmly believe that “Managing by Walking 
Around” is an effective approach to aligning execution with strategy. These managers nor-
mally spend 70% of their efforts on relationship management and 15%–30% on admin-
istrative efforts. They do not have time to measure results, so delegate this performance 
management accountability to administrative staff. The widely published quotation by 
Peter Drucker, “What gets measured gets managed,” seems to be foreign concepts to these 
“walk-around” IT managers. The three key skill requirements for modern performance 
management are strategic value integration, transformational change, and performance 
measurement. It is the responsibility of senior managers to apply the integration, transfor-
mational change, and performance measurement skills necessary to manage, measure, and 
deliver IT services. This is one of the heresies of “old-style” IT management and that have 
traditionally opened the gates for people with little or no information technology training or 
knowledge to enter the IT field as senior managers. In my view, one of the root causes of the 
performance problems that companies are ignoring or failing to address is the qualifications 
of the “skilled” senior IT manager, probably because of political pressures from executive 
management with conflicting views on whom they perceived as “skilled” senior IT manage-
ment resources.
	
Interesting to note, some senior IT managers who have limited performance management 
knowledge, skills, and qualifications, based on COBIT Performance Management stan-
dards, frequently manage the delivery of IT services, without any consideration for perfor-
mance measurement, strategic value integration, or transformational change. They normally 
express the view that human resources, finance, or business management specialists should 

Introduction to Integrated IT Performance Management  ◾  33
be accountable for measuring performance results. In my view, we have now promoted a 
human resource, finance, or business manager to the position of senior IT manager and 
have transformed the senior IT manager role to that of relationship manager “managing by 
walking around.”
	
4.	Myth: Performance management is a year-end review of the work that employees undertake, 
and sometimes too formalized, and strive on reward and punishment for management con-
trol in order to satisfy ego, status, and political behaviors for positional power.
	
	 Reality: This is a true statement of traditional hierarchical human resources performance 
management. Performance measurement, as defined in this book is an integrated repre-
sentation of employee—human resources, financial, customer, and operational measures. 
Traditional HR performance systems focus on accountability for effort that normally result 
in redundant and duplicated efforts rather than accountability for results to optimize the 
utilization people resources. A typical example of the subjective human resource perfor-
mance measures to satisfy ego, status, and political agendas. Traditional HR performance 
management is usually viewed as reward for few, punishment for innovative excellence, and 
search for the guilty, with a focus toward sound impressive and increasing political or “hid-
den” agendas. Measurement should be used for the purpose of improvement rather than to 
make judgments or place blame.
	
5.	Myth: Accountability for results is vague and political.
	
	 Reality: This statement can be true in some areas where accountability for activities, tasks, 
and efforts are the preferred mode of operations, especially in the traditional human resource 
and finance areas. In this mode of operations, people are perceived as looking busy but may 
be accomplishing meaningless or invaluable results. In my view, a culture of meaningless 
and misleading accountability seems to be the normal mode of operations. The essence 
of accountability is measured responsibility where we hold people accountable for results 
and outcomes rather than being accountable for effort and activity utilization. COBIT and 
ITIL frameworks use accountability frameworks for assigning decision-making rights and 
improving transparency and organizational excellence. The results-driven performance mea-
sures and accountability framework discussed in this book provides some practical solutions 
to addressing this concern.
	
6.	Myth: We have always managed and delivered IT projects and services without these inte-
grated performance management framework and they have worked, so why should we use 
this framework now?
	
	 Reality: The challenge here is to determine the level of success that these IT project and 
services have accomplished to the business and IT staff, using benchmarking or satisfaction 
surveys, and then demonstrate that the integrated approach to performance management 
is not a luxury but a necessary and essential element for organizational improvement and 
excellence.
	
7.	Myth: Performance Management (PM) is a Human Resource responsibility.
	
	 Reality: Interesting enough, PM is sometimes confused with HR and personal systems that 
are accustomed to measurement’s negative side. Traditional PM is viewed as punishment and 
search for the guilty, and reward for few. My normal response is this statement: “The cause 
of most performance management problems is the inability of professionals to effectively 
measure and interpret results that align with strategic outcomes to improve business success 
and increase service excellence.” The applications of performance management principles, 
as described in KPI Institute’s publications, COBIT, Six Sigma, ITIL, and PMI-PMBOK 

34  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
frameworks, are necessary to managing services and projects and in optimizing the utiliza-
tion of resources to provide value and organizational success to both the business and IT 
environments.
	
8.	Myth: These integrated IT performance management frameworks sound impressive, but our 
organization is not ready for such a transformation change, probably in the future.
	
	 Reality: A typical case of a resistance to change to maintain the “status quo” and to use 
performance management for control purposes. The application of effective performance 
management processes, results, and outcomes should NOT facilitate control purposes—
normally increase resistant to change, but rather should facilitate learning and improvement 
purposes.
	
9.	Myth: None of our managers (IT and business) is familiar with these integrated frameworks. 
It will take too much time, effort, and costs to retrain our managers.
	
	 Reality: This can be a valid statement, if the integrated performance management approach 
represents a major change in direction and culture. The best response is to determine the 
maturity level of performance management at the company and assess the ease of apply-
ing these new integrated methods. However, integration is one of the key requirements for 
modern performance management, and as such is essential for linkage with IT strategic and 
operating environments.
	 10.	Myth: Performance management integration is only necessary for organizations with a for-
mal performance management organizational structure.
	
	 Reality: Nothing can be more far from the truth. In most organizations, performance man-
agement programs—people and processes—are normally integrated within the existing 
organizational structure and do not require any formal performance management organi-
zational structure. However, some organizations may implement a program-based perfor-
mance management organization using a matrix structure. The objective of performance 
integration is to ensure that performance management; however, success is measured; is a 
viable business investment; and provides economic, political, social, and technological value 
by integrating strategic and IT operational management and aligning strategy with execu-
tion for evidence-based decision making and organizational excellence. Performance man-
agement integration whether formal or informal should fit these criteria, if they do not, then 
we have just spent time, effort, and costs on wasted and meaningless performance measures. 
The application of new and effective performance management processes should be results 
and outcomes based that focuses on accountability for results. The foundation principles 
of modern performance management principles based on the essential skill requirements 
of strategic value integration, transformational change, and performance measurement are 
necessary to ensure that performance measures fully support the strategic outcomes and 
goals of the company.
It is important to note that these myths have persuasively swayed some professionals and senior 
managers whose genuine goals to strengthen the quality, consistency, integration, accountability, 
and applicability of performance management integration principles seem to have caused them to 
take an opposing viewpoint. These individuals, in particular, need examples and scenarios about 
the what, why, when, who, and how of integrated IT performance management, about alterna-
tives, and about the consequences of disintegrated performance management. The integrated IT 
performance management framework discussed in this book provides some practical examples 
and scenarios to addressing these individuals concern.

Introduction to Integrated IT Performance Management  ◾  35
1.10  Summary
A major cause of most IT performance management problems is the inability of certain IT 
executives/managers and senior managers to apply and interpret basic performance results dur-
ing management, measurement, and delivery of IT services. Decisions are made based on emo-
tions rather than objectivity or evidence-based decision making, because of the lack of adequate 
performance management knowledge and training. Senior managers, rightly so, place emphasis 
on financial and employee—human resource measures but lack the fundamental performance 
management knowledge and training to integrate operational and customers measures, results, 
and outcomes. The end result is disintegration, poor communications, negative accountability, 
and transparency and ineffective transformational change with meaningless and misleading goals 
because of the lack of clear alignment to the organization’s strategic outcomes and goals.
Strategy is poorly executed because managers and employees do not know what the strategy 
means for their jobs. IT Operational performance is inappropriately managed because manage-
ment decisions are based on educated guesses and managers do not know how successful their 
operations, people (employees and customers), and projects are performing.
To add to these set of problems and challenges, some senior managers manage the delivery of IT 
projects and services by demanding excessive daily performance meetings and status reporting with 
key performance team members supported by an executive administrative assistant. Too much empha-
sis is placed on reporting of efforts and financials, while ignoring the most important performance 
management success factors—operational and customer measures—the basic information needed to 
determine the effort and financial performance results. In my view, we have just promoted a glorified 
secretary to the position of senior performance manager to manipulate, produce, and report on finan-
cial and effort measures using various disintegrated Microsoft excel and word documents—no wonder 
there are so many blunders and failures in delivering meaningful performance measures and results.
The solution introduced in this chapter highlights some problems and challenges relative 
to performance management knowledge, skills, and experiences that surround the IT indus-
try performance managers with specialized human resource management, financial analysts, or 
“glorified-secretarial” expertise, without any formal industry-recognized performance manage-
ment qualifications. A recommended solution is presented in Figure 1.6, with further details 
included in the “Roles and Accountabilities” section of each chapter. I certainly hope that these 
suggested performance management skills guidelines, based on the problems discussed, will be 
viewed by senior managers at performance management consulting firms as informative and 
insightful for performance management excellence. In my view, the prerequisite to effective and 
efficient application of modern performance management principles demands professional quali-
fications in accordance with KPI Institute, COBIT, Six Sigma, PMBOK, ITIL, or similar profes-
sional guidelines. The further we deviate from this goal, the more difficult it will be to close the 
gap between performance management excellence and performance management inconsistency, 
to increase progression to SEI Capability Maturity Model (CMMI), and to improve IT develop-
ment process, controls, and outcomes for performance management.
Please do not get me wrong. Skills, such as financial management and human resource man-
agement, are necessary and essential to implementing performance management key measures 
for effort and financial results. However, these skills cannot be effectively applied without clear, 
complete, and consistent understanding of the operational and customer measures and desired 
results and outcomes from sound IT Performance management training, education, and expe-
riences. Executive management keeps searching for the “silver-bullet” solution to performance 

36  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
management, and the sooner they realize that there is no “silver-bullet” solution, the outcomes will 
be less disappointments and frustrations. Their efforts toward establishing an efficient and effec-
tive performance management environment in their elusive search for organizational improvement 
and excellence to optimize the utilization of IT resources, will be more realistic and practical.
I believe that in most cases, a substantial amount of IT budget is wasted on inefficient uti-
lization, because of the dynamically advancing IT environment, complexity, and lack of under-
standing of IT performance measures, results, and value. In a majority of cases, the success of IT 
services is based on the results of financial measures—managing to budget, revenues, profits, and 
financial return on investments, with little or no consideration to measuring success based on 
eliminating operating efficiencies. My extensive experiences in addition to performance statistics 
from IT industry research firms, some of which is mentioned in my book, validate this belief. Why 
do you think there had been a recent surge in demand for benchmarking the results of IT delivery 
services? Investments whether IT or any other company’s asset must be managed and measured 
based on sound performance measures and results; otherwise, illusions of efficiencies, multiplier 
effects of inefficiencies, continuous resource, and budget increases will be the normal mode of 
operations, with no accountability for “value for money.” Looking busy by measuring level of 
effort is not the same as producing results measured by outcomes and outputs.
We need to maximize the value and return of IT investments by optimizing the utilization 
of IT resources—people, process, financial, and technology resources, using employee—human 
resources, customer, financial, and operational performance measures, as defined in this “Integrated 
IT Performance Management Framework,” discussed in this book. It provides a results-driven solu-
tion that is integrated, model-driven, and outcomes-based, with strategic directives, accountabili-
ties, outcomes, outputs, process flows, and performance measure for strategic, IT operational, and 
performance management, applied within the context of the entire IT service delivery life cycle.
In order to effectively implement this results-driven framework to address the integration, 
accountability, communications, and transformation change performance problems require man-
agers with the right performance management, skills, training, qualifications, and experiences. The 
KPI Institute research in their research publications “Performance Management in 2013” mentioned 
that Strategic Value Integration, Transformation Change, and Performance Measurement-Quality 
and Risk are three major skills that will be required of managers to support modern performance 
management requirements. COBIT5—Control Objectives for Information and related Technology

from ISACA–IT Governance Institute in their business framework shares similar skill levels for the 
governance and management of enterprise IT processes. Corporate performance management con-
cepts introduced by recent Gartner research share similar skill level requirements to integrated per-
formance management. If these observations, which I fully endorse, reflect modern performance 
management solution to our existing problems, industries, universities, and performance manage-
ment professional institutes may have some real challenges ahead of them.
The contents of this book provide an integrated IT performance management framework that 
consists of results—outcomes and outputs, process models, and performance measures. It describes 
the purpose, strategic directives, accountabilities, outcomes—outputs, process flows, and perfor-
mance measures for strategic management, IT operational management, and performance man-
agement integration. The performance measurement areas use a modified version of Kaplan and 
Norton’s strategic measures—employee, customer, operational, and financial measures.
The overall goal is to present the components of this framework and show how the models are 
implemented by people having strategic value integration—people, process, financials, and tech-
nology; transformational change—people, politics, process, and performance; and performance 
measurement—quality and risk management skills, to solve the most common and difficult root 
cause of performance management problems—integration, communications, accountability, and 
transformational change internal and external to organizational excellence. Figure1.6 is a further 
elaboration of The KPI Institute and COBIT Governance Framework revealing insights to the skill 
requirements that are necessary and essential for modern performance management implementation.

Chapter 2
Integrated IT Performance 
Management Framework
2.1  Introduction
Every theory is a self-fulfilling prophecy that orders experience into the framework it 
provides.
Ruth Hubbard
Performance management for the measurement, management, delivery, and improvement of 
information technology (IT) services is a discipline that influences every aspect of a company’s 
business. Performance management programs1 that, no matter how successfully viewed, do not 
measure the effectiveness of management using financial, employee, customer, and operational 
measures to improve organizational excellence are not a valued investment of the company’s 
resources. Strategic management, performance management, and IT operational management 
must all work together, with a consistent understanding of performance management account-
abilities, outcomes, outputs, process flows, and performance measures, to successfully improve 
organizational performance. The components of strategic management, IT operational manage-
ment, and performance management require clearly defined accountabilities using results-driven 
performance measures and accountability framework to effectively measure, manage, deliver, and 
improve IT services, including the quality and quantity of management. Strategic, operational, or 
performance management staffs that fail to fulfill their accountabilities will negatively impact the 
results of the performance management program.
The objectives of this chapter are to introduce the integrated IT performance management frame-
work (IPMF-IT)2 model, discuss the components of the conceptual and detailed models shown 
in Figures 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, and provide the accountabilities of the performance delivery 
manager,3 during the measurement, management, and delivery of IT services. Further details on 
each of the three components are provided in succeeding chapters of this book.
Since both strategic and IT operational management integrations are vital to the success of IT 
performance management, accountabilities are defined within the context of the IPMF-IT. The 
conceptual framework is provided next.

42  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
Figure 2.1 is a representation of the integrated performance management model that shows 
a conceptual view and the linkages with strategic management, performance management, and 
IT operational management. Figure 2.2 is a more detailed representation of the IPMF-IT model, 
which shows the components of strategic management, performance management, and IT opera-
tional management, with high-level linkages. The succeeding chapters of this book provide fur-
ther details on each of the three major components, with Chapter 6 focusing on the horizontal 
integration of these components, using the IT service delivery life cycle performance model4 shown in 
Figure 2.2. Chapter 7 discusses the integration of IPMF-IT framework with industry performance 
management frameworks.
2.2  Performance Management Organizational Structure
This organizational structure does not imply a new performance management structure (PMS). 
The intent is to leverage the performance responsibilities of the existing structure to support 
accountability for results and to resolve performance management challenges.
2.3  Performance Organizational Structure: Rationale
During my extensive IT career experiences, I had the opportunity to evaluate, recommend, and 
implement performance management organizational structures at many large corporations hav-
ing varying performance management maturity levels, from level 1 (Inconsistency) to level 5 
(Excellence), in accordance with CMMI® performance management maturity levels. The recom-
mendation in Figure 2.3 is based on the overwhelming need for an organizational structure to 
assist with the implementation of an integrated strategic management, performance management, 
and IT operational management solution that can be consistently applied across corporations. The 
goal was to optimize resource utilization and to ensure business and IT services deliver mean-
ingful results and improve organizational performance, including the quality and quantity of 
management. Please note that this organizational structure does not imply a new PMS. The intent 
is to utilize the existing resources,5 identify the performance accountabilities within the exist-
ing structure to ensure accountability for results—results-based management (RBM),6 improve the

quality and quantity of management, and resolve performance management challenges during the 
management and delivery of IT services.
It is hoped that this recommendation will provide a more objective organizational structure, 
rather than some of the traditional emotional “politics-based” structures, prejudiced with certain 
executive management, and/or consulting company’s personal interests. One of the main root 
causes of performance management organizational failures is the partial and prejudiced orga-
nizational structure developed by certain executive management and/or consulting company’s 
staff with self-interest that is politically motivated. Forcing alignment of an existing organiza-
tional structure to new performance management processes or forcing alignment of existing per-
formance management processes to new organizational structures created for political reasons, 
without clear accountabilities is a recipe for massive confusion and chaos. In order to address

these organizational structural issues at a large corporation, certain senior executives endorsed 
the recommendation for the creation of a performance management executive position—chief 
performance officer (CPO).7 This performance management executive who had the proper skills, 
knowledge, experiences, and professional qualifications was highly effective in implementing an 
integrated performance management organization structure, similar to Figure 2.3, to support the 
management, measurement, and delivery of IT services, based on a results-driven performance 
management framework. Performance management executives with the right skills, knowledge,

to those corporations that have attained a reasonably mature cultural climate with results-driven 
performance management.
The integrated nature of this recommended solution is based on effective execution of account-
ability and evidence-based decision making by executive managers, organizational performance 
managers, and individual performance managers. A high-level discussion on the skills, knowl-
edge, and qualifications of the performance management team is presented. It contains my “real-
world” experiences with certain major issues, challenges, problems, and recommended solutions 
that may interest those involved in performance management practices.
◾
◾The role of a performance management executive (CPO)—project position was introduced, 
in addition to the existing strategic business executives—CEO, and the IT executive—
CIO positions, to ensure that the corporate performance management results (outcomes 
and outputs) are effectively communicated, integrated, and consistently applied by both the 
business and IT staff. This CPO role, if executed, by the right person, will resolve most of 
the communications, integration, accountability, sustainability, and change management 
issues—internal and external to IT strategic services, at executive management level. This 
individual must demonstrate general strategic integration knowledge; specialized people, 
process, financials, and technology performance measurement knowledge and skills; and 
excellent understanding of transformational change—people, process, performance, and 
politics. The specialized integration skills must meet the criteria of having professional per-
formance management expertise to ensure effective integration of performance management 
results with strategic directives and operational execution.
2.3.1  Real-World Observations: Performance Management Executive
It is now time to share some of my real-world observations at a certain company. This company 
filled this performance management executive position on many occasions with individuals hav-
ing the traditional “human resource” (HR)-type performance management skills, “accounting”—
type performance management skills, and “policy specialist”—type performance management 
skills. It is interesting to note that neither of these individuals created any impact to justify the 
need for a formal or informal performance management program, and as a result, the performance 
management program was abandoned, after some years of slow but moderately successful progress. 
The cause of this failure was attributed to the lack of effective performance management measures, 
metrics, and indicators. Senior-level executives from this company hired a management consulting 
firm to assess and recommend a solution to resolve this performance management issue. This con-
sulting firm engaged various financial management consultants who had limited practical exper-
tise in how performance management, strategic and operational management can be integrated 
to provide organizational excellence. These financial management consultants carefully examined 
this performance management deficiency problem and concluded that the existing performance 
management measures were ineffective, and recommended a solution based on a new set of finan-
cial performance measures, metrics, and indicators, which were more historical based rather than 
futuristic. The new solution failed to demonstrate how the financial measures can be used to 
deliver measurable results—output and outcome, to support organizational excellence. History 
repeated itself and executives were no further ahead in understanding how results-based budgeting 
can be used to improve organizational performance. In my view, the ability of executives involved 
in performance management programs to make evidence-based decision, affect change, and pro-
vide wisdom and vision about PMS and processes needed major improvement.

46  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
This is a typical case of the lack of understanding at the executive level on the importance 
for integration, accountability, sustainability, and transformational change to implementing per-
formance management measures and results. Senior executives should understand the impact of 
integration, accountability, and transformational change to performance management, in order to 
ask the right questions and to prevent the proliferation of communications, integration, account-
ability, and transformational change problems internal and external to achieving organizational 
excellence—improving the quality and quantity of IT management.
The productivity and competitive problems the IT industry face, result from ineffec-
tive top management, petrified in place, unwilling to accept change, and failing to 
provide wisdom and vision.
Harvard Business Review
The role of the performance steering committee (project position)8 consists of the following:
◾
◾Executive management (strategic executive sponsor—CEO, with support from CFO—
Chief Financial Officer and CHRO—Chief Human Resource Officer, IT operational exec-
utive sponsor—CIO and performance management executive champion—CPO)
◾
◾Performance program management (business results manager, performance delivery man-
ager, IT results manager [organizational level])
◾
◾Performance management (performance specialists from business and IT areas [individual 
level])
2.3.2  Real-World Observations: Performance 
Management Steering Committee
It’s now time to share some real-world situations to emphasize the need for consistency, integra-
tion, sustainability, and accountability to implementing a results-driven performance manage-
ment program. Large corporations established a performance management steering committee, 
consisting of executive managers, performance program managers, and performance managers 
whose major objective was to report and communicate on the results of the performance man-
agement program, to all members of this committee, at the annual year-end reviews. Each of 
the performance measurement managers produced individual measures, metrics, and indicators, 
in different formats, for the business process that he/she was responsible for streamlining, and 
submitted them to the performance delivery manager, at the annual year-end reviews. The per-
formance delivery manager, accountable to executive management, summarized and consolidated 
the inconsistent and sometimes meaningless and misleading performance measures and results 
provided by each of the performance measurement managers. After various frustrating dialogues 
with the individual performance managers, this performance delivery manager managed to pro-
duce the performance measures and results, which were delivered to the performance manage-
ment steering committee, business and IT executive stakeholders, at regularly planned annual 
year-end review status meetings.
During each of the performance steering committee meetings, the participants spent most of 
their time trying to explain inconsistencies, rather than reporting on the performance measures 
and results to improve communications—interpretation of results, accountability and integra-
tion—internal and external to organizational business processes. It’s unbelievable to mention that 

Integrated IT Performance Management Framework  ◾  47
at the end of each meeting, there were praises for everyone’s efforts, with little consideration given 
to the administrative assistant who devoted her time nervously, making conflicting and sometimes 
inconsistent corrections to the performance measures and results, as suggested by the participants 
and/or the performance steering committee chairman. This is the result of situations that lacked 
consistent and integrated processes—a necessity for effective performance management reporting.
This is again a typical case of performance management reporting inconsistency at the execu-
tive and senior management level, which senior management should attempt to understand and 
avoid and to prevent the proliferation of communication problems and performance management 
complexities during performance management reporting. The need for a consistent, complete, 
and integrated performance management information system (PMIS),9 to enable and support busi-
ness intelligence, which is accepted and endorsed by many performance management software 
vendors, is essential for evidence-based analytical reporting.
The role of performance delivery management (project positions)10 consists of the following:
◾
◾Business results manager—To oversee the management, measurement, and delivery of the 
performance program, from the perspectives of business results or outcomes.
◾
◾Performance delivery manager—To oversee management, measurement, and delivery of the 
integrated performance management program, by integrating strategic, performance man-
agement, and IT operational management measures, results, and processes. He or she must 
possess strategic value integration, performance measurement, and transformational change 
knowledge and skills.
◾
◾IT results manager—To oversee the management, measurement, and delivery of the perfor-
mance program, from the perspectives of IT results or outcomes.
2.3.3  Real-World Observations: Performance Delivery Manager
This same organization, rightly so, appointed a senior financial manager to the perform the duties 
of business results manager, a senior HR manager to perform the duties of performance deliv-
ery manager, and a senior IT manager to perform the duties of IT results manager. There was 
no formal communications plan nor any documented accountability for results—Accountability 
Assignment Matrix (AAM).11 These managers assumed his or her level of accountability, based 
on the level of expertise that each of the managers possess—in this case, HR, IT, and financial 
management skills.
The senior financial manager, being a Certified Management Accountant, developed financial 
performance measures and results for business areas, using various disintegrated Microsoft Excel 
spreadsheets. The senior HR manager, a Masters in Human Resource Management, developed HR 
performance measures and results and a HR resource management plan for the entire performance 
program, using various disintegrated tools—performance management excel charts, without any 
Performance Measurement Structure—so you can imagine the chaos. His style of performance 
management was to fill his working calendar with daily, weekly, and monthly meetings, to justify 
the creation of a position for the “real” performance delivery manager who must report to him.
The senior IT manager, a computer science graduate developed IT performance measures 
and results, using various disintegrated tools to include, Visio and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. 
During the monthly reviews, these three senior managers anxiously meet to consolidate the infor-
mation for the monthly steering committee meeting, celebrating with a sigh of relief and self-praise 
at completion. At this corporation, the delivery of IT services was viewed by senior management 

48  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
as a technical process, and as a result should not be integrated into the company’s performance 
management program—an example of level-1 maturity level performance management organiza-
tion, in accordance with modern performance management practices from KPI-Institute, CMMI, 
COBIT, Six Sigma, PMI, Kaplan and Norton.12
This is again a typical case of lack of clear understanding and expectations of performance 
management intended outcomes or results at the senior management level that executive manage-
ment should attempt to understand, to prevent unnecessary investments in IT services delivery. 
The measures and results of IT operations must be integrated with those of the business areas in 
order to optimize business performance and realize better business results and outcomes. This 
culture of performance management that leverages performance measures and results based on 
HR staffing and finance spending is typical of organizations that lack the proper understanding of 
integrated IT performance management skills, knowledge, and experiences. The need for qualified 
performance management professionals with skills, knowledge, and experiences, similar to those 
recommended in this book, with strategic integration, transformational change, and performance 
measurement skills is necessary and essential qualifications for the practicing performance deliv-
ery managers.
The role of performance measurement managers and supporting business and IT managers is 
as follows:
◾
◾Business manager (functional business manager to oversee measurement, management, and 
delivery of business outcomes and outputs, for business performance management support).
◾
◾Performance measurement manager (functional performance measurement manager to 
integrate the measurement, management, and delivery of performance measures for strate-
gic and operational management, improve productivity across business and IT operational 
areas, and optimize resource utilization, while meeting executive management expectations. 
He or she must possess conceptual strategic integration, specialized operational transforma-
tional change, and performance measurement skills).
◾
◾IT managers (functional IT manager to oversee measurement, management, and delivery of 
the IT results–outcomes and outputs, for IT performance management support).
2.3.4  Real-World Observations: Performance Measurement Managers
There are many obstacles that performance managers are constantly faced with, during their pur-
suit for strategic and operational excellence, within the constraints of the existing performance 
management culture, mindset, behaviors, and value system. I experienced a situation at a corpora-
tion where the major reason executive management endorsed performance management principles 
was to justify the dollars given to a performance management consulting firm to develop a PMS 
and process, with the expectation that this methodology will be the substitute for their lack of 
involvement. Certain functional business and IT managers resisted any change to business or 
technical improvements, mainly because of their level of comfort with operating the existing envi-
ronments, pessimistic or regressive perspectives on the job, and fear of the unknown.
Most managers at this corporation had limited understanding of the fundamental principles of 
integrated performance measurement structure—PMS13 or balanced scorecard, and often lacked the 
required expertise to apply these basic concepts on any of their previous performance management 
assignments. As a result of this lack of knowledge and skills, these mangers resorted to the HR and 
historical financial measures of performance management, with endless frustration because of the 
lack of executive and senior management involvement and support. Remember! These executives 

Integrated IT Performance Management Framework  ◾  49
firmly believed that a consultant performance management methodology was the substitute for 
their lack of involvement.
This performance management methodology was delivered to executive and senior manage-
ment by the consulting firm, in three-ring glossy binders, with “Victorian-novel” style format, 
suitable for the archives. The voluminous, unstructured, and meaningless performance measures, 
metrics, indicators, and results created an instant distaste for performance management appetite 
by the business and IT operational professionals at this corporation. As a result, certain senior 
and executive management were hesitant in enforcing the use of this methodology and adopted 
the nondecisive “agreement-in-principle” attitude. The bullish and emotional directive, “whatever 
it takes to deliver the performance management program, whether or not a formal process or 
performance culture was adopted,” was the directive from certain senior and executive managers.
The “resistance to change” attitudes by certain functional business and IT managers were 
reinforced by these functional managers, as soon as they were informed of the lack of support 
from senior management for common, consistent, and integrated performance management mea-
sures and results. The HR manager was delegated accountability for delivering the performance 
management program, using any creative set of performance measures, processes, outcomes, and 
results, and the difficulties in obtaining business and IT operational involvement and support have 
reached that unresolved state. The performance delivery manager from HR is now left to deliver a 
performance management solution with reluctant IT and business involvement, no accepted PMS 
or processes, and little support from senior management. Senior management’s major directive 
to these HR managers is to “apply their HR performance systems, knowledge and management 
skills.” This directive is a result of their strong belief that performance management is all about 
“HR measures”—another typical case of the lack of integrated performance management. I agree 
that HR performance measurement systems and policies are one of the necessary and essential 
measures to implementing performance management. However, it would be rather difficult to 
sell a concept, idea, principle, or theory without active involvement and support from senior man-
agement and functional managers (IT and strategic business) and without sound knowledge of 
integrated performance management framework processes.
In the absence of an integrated performance management framework, the HR performance 
delivery manager, including some specialist HR consultants, adopted their “so-called” unique, 
proprietary methodology, and totally ignored the idea of integrated performance management—a 
mass confusion of political bickering and consensus—building with HR consulting resources, 
functional business and IT managers, and HR performance delivery manager hoping for that 
elusive “silver-bullet” solution. The original objective of performance management to improve the 
quality of management, encourage accountability for results, optimize the utilization of resources, 
and improve overall organizational excellence, while meeting executive management expectations, 
was transformed to HR performance measures and results, in line with certain senior managers 
view of performance management.
I never did give them hell. I just told the truth, and they thought it was hell.
Harry S. Truman
I wish to emphasize that HR and personal system aspects of performance management are abso-
lutely essential for improvement and organizational excellence. I also believe that executives 
sometimes confuse performance management with HR and personal systems. Performance man-
agement is about transforming established strategies into operational services delivery consisting of 
output, outcomes, and results, used to manage and measure the performance of an organization.

50  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
However, application of these HR systems, without a consistent understanding of an inte-
grated process framework driven by results—outcomes and outputs, is analogous to shooting 
bullets in the dark that frequently results in the managers spending unnecessary and nonproduc-
tive time and effort on looking busy with illusionary results. There exists a widespread need for a 
commonly accepted, consistent, and integrated understanding of results-driven IT performance 
management framework. This understanding of strategic and operational management integra-
tion is essential to resolve the root cause of performance management challenges—communica-
tions, integration, sustainability—sustained value creation, accountability, quality and quantity of 
management, and transformation change.
My view of this situation reveal that the existing HR performance management systems were 
based on the “Victorian-novel” procedural style processes of the 1970s by counting efforts and 
activities, which cannot be readily adapted to a culture of improvements and accountability for 
results and outcomes, using modern technology processes and tools such as business analytics, 
scorecards, and dashboards to support more evidence-based decision making.
The scenario discussed requires the establishment of simple, flexible, and integrated perfor-
mance management framework, which is results-driven accountability and demonstrate the value 
and benefits of integrated performance management principles and practices and which shows the 
alignment with both strategic management and IT operational management.
In an organization every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.
Laurence J. Peter—The Peter Principle
The remaining section of this chapter highlights the results-driven accountabilities of the perfor-
mance delivery manager to support strategic management, performance management, and IT 
operational management frameworks. Managers (IT and business) and academics should find 
these practical guidelines very useful for the measurement, management, and delivery of IT ser-
vices and projects, especially those whose interests are toward optimization and require an under-
standing of an integrated performance management framework solution.
2.4  Strategic Management
The strategic management framework, referenced in Figure 2.2, is introduced in this section 
to show the integrated nature of the performance delivery manager’s accountability for results. 
Chapter 3 discusses the integrated nature of executives (strategic, operational, and performance 
management), performance delivery managers, and performance measurement managers’ 
accountabilities for results, to improve organizational performance and quality of management 
and to optimize resource utilizations. The performance delivery manager measures, monitors, and 
reports on performance measures and results using the PMS, PMIS, and processes. The goals are 
to improve organizational excellence and quality of management, support evidence-based decision 
making using predictive analytics, and deliver IT strategic management services that support the 
following strategic management results areas:
◾
◾IT goal statement
◾
◾IT strategic framework
◾
◾IT strategic directives

Integrated IT Performance Management Framework  ◾  51
◾
◾IT policy framework
◾
◾IT performance governance structure
◾
◾IT value-based performance measurement
These results areas are integrated using strategic, performance management, and IT operational 
management accountabilities, strategic directives, outcomes, process flows, and performance mea-
sures, in accordance with modified Six Sigma-PDCA cycle, Kaplan and Norton fundamental 
elements of performance management integration, “Balanced Scorecard” employee, customer, 
operational, and financial measures. Chapter 3 discusses these integrated components in greater 
detail, using a strategic management model as the context structure.
I have introduced the results areas (what) of strategic management. In the succeeding sec-
tions, I elaborated on the information contents—performance measures and results for each of the 
results area—and presented the accountabilities (how) of the performance delivery manager who 
is accountable11 to measure, manage report, and make evidence-based decisions, using the infor-
mation contents. The accountabilities of the performance delivery manager are provided using a 
modified Six Sigma-PDCA process cycle with highlighted results to demonstrate accountability 
for results and to show how integration is achieved using results to support the management, mea-
surement, and delivery of IT strategic management services.
2.4.1  IT Goal Statement
Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal.
Henry Ford
The primary objective of this results area is to highlight the major outputs of IT goal statement 
by outlining the vision, mission, goals, values, success factors, and performance areas during the 
management, measurement, delivery, and improvement of IT services. The IT goal statement 
aligns with the IT strategic framework and IT service delivery life cycle, measured using the per-
formance management plan and implemented using IT operational plan. The integrative features 
of IT goal statement with IT strategic framework, integrated IT performance measurement dash-
board, and IT strategic directives provide the framework to optimize the utilization of resources 
and to improve organizational performance.
Executives shall use the IT goal statement as the basis for communicating, integrating, 
and making evidence-based strategic and operational decisions. Strategic management deci-
sions should be made using sound objective judgments with an understanding of operational 
impacts, rather than emotions based on “self-serving” political agendas. Sound objective judg-
ments require executive management understanding of vision, mission, goals, values, and suc-
cess factors, as well as an understanding of the integrated components to improve the quality of 
management and overall IT performance. The major outputs of the IT goal statements include 
the following:
◾
◾Vision—To achieve performance excellence by optimizing the quality and quantity of tech-
nology and IT labor resources while delivering innovative IT solutions to ensure economic 
and technical efficiencies.
◾
◾Mission—To provide IT leadership, business projects delivery and enterprise architecture 
services (EAS), applications and technology services, and a sound technology infrastructure 

52  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management

tions and performance excellence.
◾
◾Goals—Provide influential, collaborative, forward thinking, and responsive IT services to 
the business by providing IT governance, planning and administration, enterprise archi-
tecture and innovations, project portfolio management (PPM), applications management 
services (AMS), and technology operations support.

◾Values—Accountability (results management accountability framework), teamwork (collab-
oration and coordination), integration (people, process, technology, and financials), integ-
rity and trust (performance measures and accountability reporting), service and quality (IT 
resource optimization), service excellence and innovation (continuous improvement), and 
treat people with dignity and respect (attitude, positive thinking).
◾
◾Success factors—The success of the IT department is contingent upon its ability to act as a 
catalyst for innovatively leveraging technology to advance the IT strategic and operational 
plans, in accordance with the performance measurement areas. This will guide and support 
the management and delivery of applications and technology services and enable the inte-
gration of IT services into the business area to improve and transform the quality of services 
provided in the business areas.
◾
◾Performance measurement areas: Employee (to increase learning, innovations and to sustain 
our capacity and capabilities to change, transform, and improve), customer (to increase cus-
tomer satisfaction and service excellence), financial (to optimize the utilization of financial 
resources and provide financial transparency), and operational (to improve service delivery, 
operational efficiencies, relationship management, and functional management).

The primary objective of this results area is to highlight the major outputs of IT strategic frame-
work by outlining the outcomes, goals, strategies, programs, benefits, costs, and performance 
measurement areas during the management, measurement, delivery, and improvement of IT ser-
vices. The IT strategic framework aligns with IT strategic directives and IT service delivery life 
cycle, measured using the performance management plan and implemented using IT operational 
plan. The integrative features of IT strategic framework include the development or reengineering 
of business processes and the integration of strategic initiatives with operational initiatives to opti-
mize resource allocations and to improve organizational performance and quality of management.
Executives shall use the IT strategic framework as the basis for communicating, integrating, 
and making strategic and operational decisions. It represents the strategic framework for organi-
zational performance. Sound objective decisions require executive management understanding of 
the management and delivery of the company’s IT products and services, within the context of 
the IT service delivery life cycle. For each of the six functional areas of the IT service delivery life 
cycle—governance, planning and administration, enterprise architecture and innovations, PPM, 
AMS, and IT operational support—the major outputs of the IT strategic framework include the 
following:

2.4.3  IT Strategic Directives
The result of planning should be effective, efficient, and economical … that is, suitable 
for the intended purpose, capable of producing the desired results, and involving the 
least investment of resources.
Clark Crouch
The primary objective of this results area is to highlight the major outputs of the six (6) IT func-
tional areas: executive leadership; planning and administration; enterprise architecture; PPM; 
applications management; and technology operations services (TOS) for management, measure-
ment, delivery, and improvement of IT services. The IT strategic directives align with IT service 
delivery life cycle and the performance measurement area or balanced scorecard,13 measured by the 
performance management plan and implemented by IT operational plan. The integrative features 
of IT strategic directive include the development or reengineering of IT policy framework and 
the integration of the performance measurement areas with operational initiatives to optimize 
resource allocations and to improve organizational excellence and quality of management.
Executives shall use the IT strategic directives as the basis for communicating, integrating, and 
making strategic and operational decisions. These IT strategic directives, which are aligned with 
the performance measurement areas or balance scorecard, formed the basis for the identification 
of outputs, outcomes, and performance measures. Sound objective judgments require executive 
management understanding of the management and delivery of the company’s IT products and 
services, within the context of the IT service delivery life cycle. For each of the six functional 
areas of the IT service delivery life cycle—governance, planning and administration, enterprise 
architecture and innovations, PPM, AMS, and IT operational support—the major outputs of IT

2.4.5  IT Performance Governance Structure
Governance is the process whereby people in power make decisions that create, destroy 
or maintain social systems.
Maria Ramos (CEO, Transnet)

Integrated IT Performance Management Framework  ◾  57
The primary objective of this results area is to highlight the major outputs of IT perfor-
mance governance structure by outlining the structure and process during the management, 
measurement, delivery, and improvements of IT services. The IT performance governance 
structure14 aligns with the IT strategic framework and IT service delivery life cycle, measured 
using the performance management plan and implemented using IT operational plan. The 
integrative features of IT performance governance structure align with IT policy framework, 
IT performance measurement dashboard 15, and IT strategic directives, which provide the frame-
work to optimize the utilization of resources and to improve organizational performance and 
quality of management. This IT performance governance structure aligns with IT policy 
framework and ensures that associated standards are adopted and best practices or guidelines 
are developed. It is based on KPI Institute-Performance Management and COBIT industry-
wide guidelines.
Executives shall use the IT performance governance structure as the basis for communicating, 
integrating, and making evidence-based strategic and operational decisions. This decision-making 
structure shows how decisions are made, who makes the decision, who is held accountable, and 
how the results of the decisions are measured, monitored, and managed to ensure effective and 
efficient utilization of IT resources. Sound objective judgments require executive management 
understanding of IT performance structure, as well as an understanding of the integrated compo-
nents to improve the quality of management and overall IT performance. The major outputs of the 
IT performance governance structure include the following: 
◾
◾Structure—Answers “who” and “what” question of IT governance. Who are they govern-

2.4.6  IT Value-Based Performance Measurements
Most individuals and organizations don’t get what they want because they don’t 
measure what they really want.
W. Edwards Deming
The primary objective of this results area is to highlight the major outputs of IT value-based per-
formance measurement by outlining process improvement, organizational alignment, technology 
enablement, performance culture, financial performance and accountability for results, during the 
management, measurement, delivery, and improvement of IT services. Value-based measurements 
are aligned with operational performance and IT strategic framework performance, measured 
using the performance measurement dashboard, and implemented using IT operational plan. The 
integrative features of IT value-based performance measurements with IT strategic framework, 
IT performance management dashboard, and IT strategic directives provide the framework to 
optimize the utilization of resources and to improve organizational performance and quality of 
management. 
In a results-based accountability environment, executives shall use the IT value-based per-
formance measurement as the basis for getting the right performance measurement in place for 
organizational success. In order to drive performance, executive decisions need to be based on 
measurements that are clearly linked with business value to obtain an accurate indication of what 
is working and what is not working. The major outputs of the IT value-based performance mea-
surement include the following: 
◾
◾Process improvement—To achieve process performance excellence by simplifying and 
streamlining IT processes and related business processes to managing, measuring, deliver-
ing, and improving IT services.

2.4.6.1  Real-World Observations: Performance Measurement Dashboard
It’s worth mentioning a real-world scenario at a company, which established a value-based per-
formance measurement dashboard to manage, monitor, measure, and improve the delivery of 
IT services. Business and IT resources were approved, budget allocated and the performance 
measurement dashboard were implemented according to the established schedule. During the 
performance measurement dashboard implementation, there was a certain level of frustration or 
“political power struggles,” which resulted in the strategic management group identifying and 
delivering various strategic outputs and performance measures, managed by an appointed business 
results manager. At the same time, IT operational group also identified and delivered various IT 
outputs and performance measures, managed by an appointed IT results manager. 
However, neither of these IT operational nor strategic management outputs and performance 
measures were integrated or aligned with the approved performance management program, and 
as such there was an overwhelming demand for integrated strategic, IT operational, and perfor-
mance management outputs and performance measures. This is a typical case of inefficient use of 
the company’s most vital resources (people), because of the lack of the basic knowledge, skills, and 
application for performance measurement integration. One of the recommended solutions pre-
sented in this book is based on the foundation principles of integrating strategic, IT operational, 
and performance management as outlined in the performance management plan—an integrated 
PMS and process, for implementing the performance management program. Since the focus of 
this section is on IT value-based performance measurements using an integrated IT performance 
measurement dashboard, an overview of the main contents is provided, with a highlight of the 
major accountabilities of the performance delivery manager who was involved in delivering this 
integrated IT performance measurement dashboard.
Integrated IT performance measurements dashboard includes
◾
◾Dashboard structure—operations, employee, customer, financial outputs; outputs start and 
target dates
◾
◾Dashboard change—organizational, cultural, trend analysis, analytics
◾
◾Dashboard resource—% complete, # improvements; progress indicator
If you have a desire to increase reporting value and enable clear understanding of where the per-
formance of your business can be improved, then value-based measurements can be suitable for 
your purpose. The integrated IT performance measurement dashboard is the basis for determining 
areas of improvements and understanding what’s working and what is not working. The perfor-
mance delivery manager will have accountabilities for the overall accuracy, completeness, timeli-
ness, relevancy, and consistency of the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard. These 
accountabilities and performance measurement characteristics will make the dashboard desirable 
for evidence-based decision making, using predictive analytics.

2.5  Performance Management
The performance management framework, referenced in Figure 2.2, is introduced in this sec-
tion to show the integrated nature of the performance delivery manager’s accountabilities. 
Chapter 4 discusses the integrated nature of strategic, IT operational, and performance man-
agement executives, performance delivery managers, and performance measurement managers’ 
accountabilities to ensure optimum resource utilization and improve organizational perfor-
mance. The performance delivery manager measures, manages, delivers, and improves IT 
performance management services to effectively support the following IT performance man-
agement results areas:
◾
◾IT service delivery life cycle performance model
◾
◾IT performance management delivery processes
–	 Performance management standard 
–	 Performance measurement systems
–	 Performance management reporting
–	 Performance improvement management 
–	 Performance change management
–	 HR performance management
–	 Financial performance management
◾
◾Performance measurement office support 
These performance management results areas are integrated through execution of strategic man-
agement, performance management and IT operational management accountabilities, outputs/
outcomes, processes, and performance measures, in accordance with KPI Institute Performance 
Management fundamental elements of IT resources integration (people, process, technology, and 
financials). Chapter 4 of this book discusses these integrated components in greater detail, using a 
performance management model, as the communications medium.
I introduced the results areas (what) of performance management. In the succeeding sec-
tions, I elaborated on the results—outputs/outcomes for each of the results areas and presented 
the accountabilities (how) of the performance delivery manager who is accountable to manage, 
measure, communicate, and make decisions, based on the results. The accountabilities of the 
performance delivery manager show the integrated nature of the performance management

2.5.1  IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model
The result of planning should be effective, efficient, and economical … that is, suitable 
for the intended purpose, capable of producing the desired results, and involving the 
least investment of resources.
Clark Crouch
The primary objective is to ensure that IT services are managed, measured, delivered, and improved 
in compliance with the six (6) functional area of the IT service delivery life cycle. Each of the 
six (6) functional areas establishes outcomes, goals, strategies, programs and initiatives, benefits, 
costs, and performance measures as the framework to ensure optimum utilization of IT resources 
and to improve organizational performance and quality of management.
The IT service delivery life cycle discussed in this book focuses on a RBM approach, with 
alignment to the six (6) functional areas. The six (6) functional areas of IT service delivery life 
cycle, which aligns with IT performance measurement dashboard and IT products/service life 
cycle, are as follows:

2.5.2  IT Performance Management Delivery Processes
Leadership is getting the right people to do the right thing for the right reason in the 
right way at the right time at the right use of resources (costs).
Clark Crouch
The primary objective is to ensure that performance results are managed, measured, delivered, 
and improved using a set of consistent and integrated strategic and IT operational performance 
management outcomes, processes, and performance measures. Performance management of IT 
products and services require accurate, complete, timely, consistent, and effective performance 
measurement processes within the overall performance management plan.18 Every performance 
management plan, whether strategic or IT oriented, aligns with the balanced scorecard or 
performance measurement dashboard and a clear understanding of these alignment permit per-
formance managers to better control the performance results to ensure integration with strategic 
and IT operational processes.
The major responsibilities of the performance delivery manager are highlighted to show why 
this individual requires the essential skills (strategic value integration [people, process, financials, 
technology]), transformational change (people/culture, politics, process, performance), and per-
formance measurement (quality, risk management). These are skills needed to resolve the most 
common and complex root causes of performance management problems (integration, communi-
cations, accountability, and transformational change for organizational excellence).
The IT performance management delivery processes, which can also apply to the business, as 
discussed in this book, are based on the guidelines published by KPI Performance Management 
Institute. The seven (7) Key Results Areas (KRAs)19 mentioned in this book, which formed the 
basis in defining the IT performance management delivery processes, are as follows: 
	
1.	Performance management standards: Key results are results quality/quantity, results effec-
tiveness/efficiencies, results accountability, results rewards/recognition, and performance 
management program. 
	
2.	Performance measurement systems: Key results are output/outcomes, measures, metrics, 
indicators; performance measurement program.
	
3.	Performance management reporting: Key results are integrated performance measurement 
dashboard analytics, results transparency. 
	
4.	Performance management improvements: Key results are organizational excellence, 
feedback/reviews, KRAs.
	
5.	Performance change management: Key results are transformational change (people/culture, 
politics, process, and performance) and change sustainability. 
	
6.	HR performance management: Key results are HR performance plan and HR performance 
measures.
	
7.	Financial performance management: Key results are financial performance plan and finan-
cial performance measures.

2.5.2.5  Performance Change Management
In order to improve something you have to able to change it. In order to change it, 
you have to be able to understand it. In order to understand it, you have to be able to 
measure it.
The Author
Performance change management as presented in this book focuses on two (2) major outputs: 
transformational change and change strategy sustainability. Performance change management 
results area establishes a common framework for sustaining change for employee, customer, 
financial, and operations performance measures, as presented in the performance measurement 
dashboard. It establishes the basis to ensure transformation change from the perspectives of 4Ps—
people/culture, politics, process, and performance results. Culture is the result of mindset, shared 
values/beliefs, attitudes/behaviors, and informal rules. You need to use the power of culture to 
effect transformational change. Politics is the manifested result of self-interest, conflicting goals, 
hidden agenda, and loss of power. Process is the result of strategy, standards, policy, plans, and 
structures. 
Sustainable change strategy as defined by Harvard business guru John Kotter’s eight (8) stages 
of organizational transformation are as follows:
	
1.	Establishing a sense of urgency
	
2.	Forming a powerful guiding coalition 
	
3.	Creating a vision
	
4.	Communicating the vision
	
5.	Removing obstacles and empowering others
	
6.	Planning for and creating short-term wins
	
7.	Consolidating improvements
	
8.	Institutionalizing new approaches

2.5.3  Performance Measurement Office Processes
Measurement is not something that should be reserved for the select few; in a high-
performing organization, measurement is everybody’s job.
Charles Kettering
Many IT consultants are providing leadership in helping organizations establish formal perfor-
mance measurement processes to support the delivery of IT services by optimizing the utiliza-
tion of IT resources, improving organizational excellence, reducing quantity of management, and 
increasing quality of management. These leadership roles are the result of urgent requests from 
stakeholders to optimize the utilization of the company’s IT resource assets. The ability to effec-
tively deliver IT services more effectively and efficiently requires the implementation of common 
measurement processes and practices across the entire organization. The result normally is very 
little learning curve for the performance delivery manager, performance measurement managers, 
and performance specialists as they progress throughout the IT service delivery life cycle. 
The larger an organization gets, and the more demand for IT performance measures, the more 
difficult it becomes to enforce this organizational performance consistency. Without this consis-
tency, the full value of implementing a common performance measurement methodology cannot 
be realized. Some IT consulting firms recognize this and usually provide a common framework or 
a full methodology that most of their consultants execute in their consulting practices. However, 
this practice of common, integrated, and consistent performance measurement processes is highly 
dependent on the maturity level of the client companies. This is where consulting firms—with 
the right skills level and experience in applying performance measurement processes—can offer 
tremendous useful support to their clients.
The right consultant can help to establish a centralized organization that is responsible for 
varying aspects of performance measurement methodologies. This group can be called perfor-
mance office, enterprise performance office, performance measurement center of excellence, or 
the performance measurement resource team. Here, I will use the term PMO. A PMO can offer 
many potential performance-related products and services, depending on the performance needs 
of the organization and the vision of the PMO sponsor (the person who is generally responsible 

Integrated IT Performance Management Framework  ◾  75
for the PMO funding). Before the PMO can be successful, agreement must be obtained from 
the management team on the overall role and general expectations of the PMO. A typical PMO 
is responsible for deploying a consistent performance measurement methodology within the 
organization, including people-performance specialists, processes-templates and best practices, 
and technology-automated dashboard/scorecard. This is not a one-time event but a culture of 
improvement mindset. While a PMO requires performance specialist type of resources, the hope 
is that investments in the PMO will be justified by implementing common practices and ensur-
ing a results-based accountability culture. This establishes the performance structure and process 
to enable IT services within IT service delivery life cycle to be managed and delivered with 
reduced quantity of management and increased quality of management, in meeting stakeholders’ 
expectations. 
Certain IT consultants tend to be further along in their adoption of common and consistent 
performance measurement processes that utilize outcomes-driven or results-based accountabil-
ity orientation. Many companies use these IT consulting services to assist them in their des-
perate search for a more effective and efficient integrated solution. Here is a list that shows the 
major accountabilities that the PMO will normally execute within an organization. It presents 
the accountabilities to show how the PMO can influence the client’s business. The PMO value 
proposition can be established to provide a narrow or broad set of measurement and/or assessment 
services. This list includes many of the common accountabilities that a PMO would normally 
perform. In general, in a PMO:
2.5.3.1  Performance Delivery Manager Accountabilities
(Accountable for the delivery of result)
◾
◾Performance measurement processes, outputs/outcomes, and inputs templates, defined in 
the performance measurement plan
◾
◾Performance improvement processes, outputs/outcomes, and inputs templates, defined in 
the performance improvement plan
◾
◾Integrated IT performance measurement dashboard: employee, financial, customer, and 
operations
◾
◾Benchmarking and assessment results: Six (6) functional areas of IT services delivery life 
cycle
PMO staff is accountable for the execution of the following processes:
◾
◾Establishes and deploys a common set of performance measurement processes and tem-
plates, which saves each performance specialist or manager from having to recreate these 
performance measurement constructs. These reusable performance measurement processes 
and structures help in the execution of performance management program. 
◾
◾Provides a methodology and the necessary updates to maintain improvements and best prac-
tices. For example, as new or revised processes and templates are made available, the PMO 
deploys them consistently across the organization.
◾
◾Facilitates improved performance specialists communications by having common processes, 
outputs/outcomes, and terminology. Less misunderstanding and confusion occurs within 
the organization if everyone uses the same performance measurement language and termi-
nology for results-based accountability.

76  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
◾
◾Provides training (internal or outsourced) to build core performance measurement compe-
tencies and a common set of experiences. If the training is delivered by the PMO, there is a 
further reduction in overall training costs paid to outside vendors.
◾
◾Delivers performance measurement coaching services to prevent performance manage-
ment resistivity. Performance change management—people/culture, politics, process, and 
performance—can also experience smoother transition.
◾
◾Tracks basic information on the current status of all performance results–outputs/outcomes 
and provides performance trends and analytics to management in a common and consistent 
manner.
◾
◾Tracks organization-wide metrics on the state of performance management, integrated IT 
performance measurement dashboard, and the value being provided to the business. The 
PMO also assesses the general IT services management and delivery environment on an 
ongoing basis to monitor the improvements.
◾
◾Acts as the overall advocate for performance management to the organization. This includes 
actively educating, selling executives, managers, and team members on the value gained 
through the use of consistent performance measurement processes.
In summary, companies are finding that they need to standardize on how IT performance mea-
surement processes are delivered. They are recognizing that the process takes much more than just 
training the staff. It requires a holistic approach, covering many aspects of work and the company 
culture. However, in their search for this process solution, certain companies have experienced 
endless frustration, and lack of professional integrity, resulting in the expensive lesson-learned 
scenarios. Here is a real-world situation that executive management should avoid in their search 
for that ultimate performance measurement process solution.
Processes or methodologies can be SMART—Specific, Measurable, Achievable, 
Realistic, and Timely, or DUMB—Doubtful, Unrealistic, Massive, and Boring
The Author
2.5.3.2  Real-World Observations: PMO Processes
A large corporation employed an IT consulting firm to develop and deploy a performance mea-
surement methodology with the expectation that this process framework will solve most of the 
communications and accountability problems previously recommended during a recent assess-
ment of IT services. The expectation is that this process solution will ensure a more evidence-based 
decision-making process, using predictive analytics. This consulting firm proudly produced a set 
of performance measurement processes that had the characteristics of a “DUMB” methodology, 
with volumes of disjointed processes, outputs/outcomes, measures, and indicators. 
Senior management at this corporation, overwhelmed and confused with the voluminous 
contents of the “DUMB” methodology, decided to establish an innovative performance mea-
surement methodology, similar to KPI Institute, CMMI, and Six Sigma process framework. 
Another IT management consulting firm was contracted to deliver this solution. This consult-
ing firm, and the lead consultant, believed that performance measurement is a distinct and 
isolated discipline. The final deliverable from this consulting firm was a set of performance 
measurement processes, with no alignment to the previously developed performance measure-
ment methodology. In my assessment, this consulting firm produced an integrated subset of 

Integrated IT Performance Management Framework  ◾  77
Six Sigma, KPI Institute, and CMMI processes with their company’s logo, with no reference 
to how these processes can be applied. 
The IT operations group, whose mandate was to deliver IT services, adopted the outsourced 
vendor’s performance measurement process solutions, for all outsourced services, and totally 
ignored the recommendations from the PMO. One of their main reasons for nonacceptance of the 
PMO recommendation was the lack of strategic management integration with the methodology 
and the performance measurement processes. 
Senior management decided to addresses the IT operations group’s concerns by employing yet 
another consulting firm with strategic management expertise, to deliver a strategic management 
methodology. 
This consulting firm, and the lead consultant, believed that enterprise architecture was the 
process solution for this corporation. They convinced senior management on the establishment 
of an Enterprise Architecture Office (EAO). The resulting product was an enterprise architecture 
methodology and recommended EAO structure, with no clear alignment to performance mea-
surement processes and the IT services delivery life cycle performance model. The client company 
is now left with three useless methodologies that can be characterized as DUMB.
This is a real-world scenario, where these IT consulting firms have “secretly turned client’s 
problems to their personal gold treasures,” a common practice in the IT industry that senior 
executive management must be aware of and take proactive actions to avoid. PMO processes can-
not be developed and deployed in isolation of strategic management and IT operational manage-
ment processes. The need for PMO process integration is a necessary and essential requirement for 
success, to deliver value to the corporation, and to ensure IT services are delivered to optimize the 
utilization of IT resource and improve operational performance and quality of management, to 
effectively meet stakeholders’ expectations. 
I have introduced the component processes (what) of the PMO. I will now present the account-
abilities/responsibilities (how) of the performance delivery manager who is responsible to man-
age, communicate, and make decisions, based on the information contents. The accountabilities/
responsibilities of the performance delivery manager show the integrated nature of the PMO 
component processes, to support the management and delivery of the overall performance man-
agement program.

2.6  IT Operational Management
The components of IT operational management, referenced in Figure 2.2, are introduced in this 
section to identify and define the major IT results areas and to show how the performance delivery 
manager manages, measures, delivers, and improves these results areas. Chapter 5 elaborates on 
these results areas, including details on the integrated nature of the performance delivery manager 
with accountabilities of the executive performance manager and performance measurement team. 
The performance delivery manager measures, delivers, and improves on IT service delivery life 
cycle performance model and IT operational management major results areas of

Management and Nolan and Kaplan Balanced Scorecard fundamental elements of integra-
tion: people, process, technology, and financials. Chapter 5 of this book discusses these com-
ponents in greater details, using an IT operational management model as the communications 
medium.
I have introduced the major results areas (what) of IT operational management. In the suc-
ceeding sections, I elaborated on the results/outputs/outcomes for each of the results areas and 
presented the accountabilities (how) of the performance delivery manager who is accountable to 
manage, communicate, and make decisions, based on the results. The accountabilities of the per-
formance delivery manager show the integrated nature of IT operational management results 
areas, to support the management, measurement, and delivery of the overall performance manage-
ment program.
2.6.1  Financial Accountability
The budget process is in shambles, devoid of accountability, transparency and enforce-
ment measures.
Tom Schatz
The primary objective is to improve financial accountability by committing to managing, 
measuring, delivering, and improving capital costs and operating costs by optimizing budget 
allocations, actual expenses, and forecasted expenses. Financial accountability is a measured 
financial commitment that delivers transparent, credible, and effective capital, and operat-
ing costs. It formed the basis for sound financial management, improved organizational per-
formance, and optimized resource utilizations. Decisions regarding IT investments must be 
evidenced based, driven from the IT budget plan and the integrated IT performance measure-
ment dashboard. IT investment costs for projects—capital and operational services—operat-
ing, include the following:
◾
◾Capital cost (business projects)
–	 Business project-1
–	 Business project-2
–	 Business project-n
◾
◾Capital costs (technology projects)

approach. HR accountability is a measured commitment that delivers engaged, motivated to learn 
and improve, accountable for results, mutual trust, ethical, and credible HR capital investments. 
It formed the basis for sound people management, improved organizational performance, and 
optimized HR utilizations. Decisions regarding HR capital investments must be evidence based, 
driven from the IT performance management contract/plan, strategic directives, and the inte-
grated IT performance measurement dashboard. 
Proper resource allocations begin with an understanding of the organization’s IT labor resource 
utilization and skills inventory, documented in the IT Resource Plan.24 IT resource capacity and 
staff planning enables organizations to optimize skills usage to ensure that all high-quality critical 
resources are productively aligned with high priority technology services.

Accountability breeds response-ability.
Stephen R. Covey
The primary objective is to improve operational process accountability by committing to manag-
ing, measuring, delivering, and improving business processes and IT processes by streamlining 
processes and/or performing reengineering initiatives. Operational process accountability is a pro-
cess measure that delivers management (functional and relationship) and delivery services (service 
delivery and service excellence). It formed the basis for simple and streamlined processes man-
agement, improved organizational performance, and optimized process utilizations. Decisions 
regarding operational process accountability must be results based, driven from IT strategic plan, 
IT operating plan, and the integrated IT performance management dashboard. Operational pro-
cess accountability—business and IT processes, includes

2.6.6  Technology Operations Support Accountability
Employers should not focus on employee accountability alone.
Helen Darling
The primary objective is to improve accountability for Technology Operations Support (TOS)27 by 
committing to managing, measuring, delivering, and improving TOS services by streamlining 
support processes, improving performance, and optimizing resources. Technology operations sup-
port is a measure that delivers contracted services, performance measures, accountability report-
ing, and outsourced governance model for the effective and efficient delivery of TOS outsourced 
services. It formed the basis for effective and efficient TOS management, improved organizational 
performance, and optimized TOS resource utilizations. Decisions regarding TOS performance 
must be results based, driven from a results-based accountability management culture, IT strate-
gic plan, TOS outsourced contract, and the integrated IT performance management dashboard. 
TOS performance accountability—contract services, TOS performance measures, accountability 
reporting, and governance model consists of the following:
◾
◾Contracted services
–	 SD, SE, RM
–	 Output/outcomes
◾
◾AMS performance measures
–	 SD, SE,RM
–	 Output/outcomes, KPI
◾
◾Accountability reporting
–	 SD, SE,RM Costs
–	 Performance reports
◾
◾Governance model
–	 Oversight/decisions
–	 Outsourced strategy
TOS accountability refers to the commitment an individual, team, or organization assumes for 
the delivery of the TOS performance results/output/outcomes and accountabilities for technology 
operations outsourced services. This commitment includes
◾
◾Answering—providing an explanation or justification—for the delivery of the TOS perfor-
mance results/output/outcomes and accountabilities

The major accountabilities of the performance delivery manager in performing strategic man-
agement duties are highlighted in Table 2.1 to show the integrated performance management 
knowledge and skills requirements of this individual. 
The major responsibilities of the performance delivery manager in performing performance 
management duties are highlighted in Table 2.2 to show the necessary integrated performance 
management knowledge and skills requirements.
The major accountabilities of the performance delivery manager in performing IT operational 
management duties are highlighted in Table 2.3 to show the necessary integrated performance 
management knowledge and skills requirements.
2.7.1  Real-World Observations: Performance 
Delivery Manager Accountabilities 
Many performance managers and senior managers, especially those without the basic IT 
qualifications and skills, strongly express their views that IT professionals with technology 
qualifications, skills, and knowledge are not suitable to perform the role of IT performance 
delivery manager. They make statements to the effect that these “techies” should be IT archi-
tects not IT performance managers. These senior managers firmly believe that the only skill 
required of IT performance delivery managers is relationship management. I firmly support 
this necessary communications skills requirement. However, lesson learned, as a result of my 
extensive experiences in technologically advancing industry, is that performance measures and 
results reported by managers without the necessary IT qualifications, skills, and knowledge 
normally result in being misunderstood, misrepresented, and poorly communicated-twisted 
logic.
I will end this real-world observation with two simple and powerful quotations: 
A stupid man’s report of what a clever man says can never be accurate, because he 
unconsciously translates what he hears into something he can understand.
Bertrand Russell
Misunderstandings usually occur because of differences in thinking preferences.
James P. Lewis
2.8  Applying Integrated Framework to Other Disciplines
Customers require the effective integration of technologies to simplify their workflow 
and boost efficiency.
Anne M. Mulcahy
Although this book is based on an integrated IT performance management model (framework) 
represented in Figure 2.2, this framework can be adapted to fit within the performance man-
agement context of other business discipline, such as engineering, manufacturing, and account-
ing. The basic functional components of performance management may not change drastically. 
However, the strategic and operational components of the industry business discipline will change

2.10  Summary
The integrated IT performance management (framework) presented in this chapter shows the com-
ponent results areas of this framework. It also discusses the accountabilities of the performance 
delivery manager to demonstrate the integrated nature in managing, measuring, and delivering 
IT services. RBM processes integrated with traditionally managed organizations in a regressive 
culture—“It’s a matter of survival not efficiency,” sound impressive but in reality is not likely to

make an improved difference. To make a difference for success requires a culture that values the 
necessity for accountability, integrity, and ethics. 
These organizations should consider the following recommendations, as a framework, to guide 
them toward successful management, measurement, and delivery of IT services.
◾
◾Develop goal statement, strategic framework, strategic directives, performance governance, 
and value-based performance measurement for IT strategic management that shows the 
alignment of IT strategic directives with IT operational management, IT service delivery life 
cycle, and performance measurement dashboard. The end result is a performance measure-
ment dashboard with outputs and outcomes that directly align with the IT strategic direc-
tives. The performance measures, metrics, and analytics are descriptive properties of the 
output/outcomes, which demonstrate the integrative components of the three major results 
areas: strategic management, performance management, and IT operational management. 
◾
◾Define the IT service delivery life cycle and measure, manage, and monitor the results/
outcomes/outputs of these IT services, using an integrated IT performance dashboard for 
evidence-based decision making, using predictive analytics.
◾
◾Establish and communicate PMO processes, tools, and techniques to business and IT staff. 
◾◾Define clear accountabilities for executive management, performance program management, 
and performance measurement, for strategic, performance, and IT operational management. 
◾
◾Obtain approval and support from executive managers on the goal statement, strategic 
framework, strategic directives, policy framework, performance governance, and value-
based performance measurement. Also, the integrated IT performance measurement dash-
board and IPMF-IT. 
◾
◾Communicate and ensure performance managers adhere to performance management poli-
cies, processes, standards/guidelines, and RBM.
◾
◾Ensure that the performance delivery manager is a performance management profes-
sional, with strategic integration, transformational change, and performance manage-
ment skills. 
◾
◾Ensure that the performance delivery manager understands the linkage between opera-
tional, strategic, and performance management, as presented in this chapter, and detailed in 
the remaining chapters of book. 
In this foundation chapter, I introduced an IPMF-IT model, discussed the applications of this 
framework in terms of the three functional components of strategic, IT operational, and perfor-
mance management, and highlighted the key accountabilities of the performance delivery man-
ager. Chapters 3 through 5 elaborate on each of these three functional components; Chapter 6 
shows the horizontal integration of these three functional components with the IT service delivery 
life cycle performance model and the strategic directives. Chapter 7 discusses the implementation 
of this IPMF-IT model, using various industry-wide guidelines.

2.12  Questions to Think About: Management Perspectives
	
1.	Think about how your organization manages and measures IT services. How is the cul-
tural of RBM and RBB being transformed? How does your organization view integration, 
accountability, and change management? How are IT services structured? What is the key 

100  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
rationale for the organizational structure? How does individual greed for power, politics, 
performance, and personal financial interests affect the organization structure? What are the 
major results areas of integrated IT performance management? How do these results areas 
relate to your IT structures and processes? What is the mindset of senior management for 
results-based management and performance improvement? 
	
2.	Think about how your organization involves executives and business staff during perfor-
mance management strategy formulation and execution. What are the performance man-
agement delivery processes that align operational management with strategic management 
during IT services delivery life cycle? How are these performance management delivery 
processes communicated? 
	
3.	Think about how your organization involves performance measurement staff during project 
initiation and execution. What are the performance measurement outcomes/outputs and 
performance measures that align IT operational management with strategic management 
during IT services delivery life cycle? How are these processes communicated? How does 
your organization integrate IT service delivery life cycle with performance measurement 
processes? What is senior managements’ perception on the responsibilities, needs, and ben-
efits of an integrated IT performance measurement dashboard? How does senior manage-

Chapter 3
Strategic Management Model
3.1  Strategic Management
The function of strategic management XE “business management” is to ensure that IT services are 
effectively measured, managed, delivered, reported, and improved using a results-based account-
ability framework. It consists of the following results areas:
◾
◾IT goal statements
◾
◾IT strategic framework
◾
◾IT strategic directives
◾
◾IT policy framework
◾
◾IT governance framework
◾
◾IT value-based performance measurement (VBPM)
Figure 3.1 is a graphical representation of the modeling concepts that demonstrates the structure 
and relationships of the definitions or processing components of strategic management, from a 
performance management perspective.
The intent of this chapter is not to provide detailed processes or procedures on the implemen-
tation of the strategic management processes or similar strategic improvement processes. There 
are many excellent books on strategic management processes, concepts, theory, and applicabil-
ity, some of which are mentioned in the “Recommended Readings” section provided at the end 
of each chapter. The main objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of the contents 
(what), purpose (why), accountabilities (who is accountable for what), and results (what, how, 
why) of strategic management and to demonstrate how it fits within the context of the overall 
integrated IT performance management framework. The “accountability” section provides results-
based accountability for the executive performance manager, the performance delivery manager, 
and the performance measurement team—performance measurement manager and performance 
specialists. The results sections for each of the IT strategic management results areas provide the 
outputs/outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance measures (why) to support the 
measurement, management, delivery, improvement, and integration of the strategic management 
results areas. The performance measures from the performance measurement dashboard mainly 

104  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
show staff input metrics for demonstration purposes. In reality, the dashboard contains many 
combinations of results for input, process, and output/outcomes measures.
Don’t measure your performance by what you have accomplished, but by what you 
should have accomplished within your capabilities.
Jeroen De Flander
The material presented in the following sections is organized to support the structure represented 
in Figure 3.1. This structure will provide the readers with a logical and consistent flow of informa-
tion to enable them to gain a better understanding and better appreciate the integrated nature of 
IT performance management.
3.2  IT Goal Statement
Executives shall use the IT goal statement1 as the basis for communicating, integrating, and mak-
ing evidence-based strategic and operational decisions. Strategic management decisions should be 
made using sound objective judgments with an understanding of operational impacts, rather than 
emotions-based with “self-serving” political agendas. Sound objective judgments require executive 
management understanding of vision, mission, goals, values, success factors, performance mea-
surement areas, as well as an understanding of the integrated components to improve the quality 
of management and overall IT performance. The major outputs of the IT goal statements include 
the following:

3.2.4  Results: IT Goal Statement
Accountabilities6 discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for who 
is accountable for what during the delivery of the IT goals statement outputs/outcomes. Results 
are now introduced to highlight the outputs of this IT goal statement results area and respective 
outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance measures (why). It is intended to serve as a 
reference based on the English language interrogatives: Who is accountable for what, how, and why. 
The outputs/outcomes, process flow, and performance measures, based on real-world practical 
implementation, will serve as excellent references for the practicing performance managers during 
measurement, delivery, and reporting of IT goal statement outputs and outcomes.
The outputs/outcomes highlight the key results the performance managers are accountable 
to manage, measure, and report during the delivery of the IT goal statement results area. The 
process flow, based on real-world practical implementations, is a graphical representation of the 
inputs, process, outputs, and relationships. The goal statement performance model diagram shows 
a representation to communicate the integrated components of IT goal statement with strategic, 
IT operational, and performance management staff.
The performance measures from the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard for IT 
goal statement outputs/outcomes are illustrated for “IT Executive Leadership: Operational-FM” mea-
sures. Appendices A through F provide further details. Performance metrics, indicators, progress, 
trends, and analytics formed the basis for evidence-based decision making to enable improved organi-
zational excellence.

3.3  IT Strategic Framework
Executives shall use the IT strategic framework as the basis for communicating, integrating, and 
making strategic and operational decisions. It represents the strategic framework for organiza-
tional performance. Sound objective decisions require executive management understanding of 
the measurement, management, and delivery of the company’s IT products and services, within 
the context of the IT service delivery life cycle. For each of the six functional areas of the IT service 
delivery life cycle—governance, planning and administration, enterprise architecture and innova-
tions, project portfolio management, applications management services, and IT operational sup-
port, the major outputs of the IT strategic framework include the following:
◾
◾Outcomes—Intended to cover the results of IT services within the context of the IT services 
delivery life cycle. Outcomes are the results that express benefits, accomplishments, goals, 
and impacts/changes—what difference are we making? For each of the functional areas 
within the IT services, providing “what, how, when, and to whom” IT services should be 
delivered.
◾
◾Goals—Provide the result (what) to achieving the outcomes and realizing the benefits for 
each of the functional areas of the IT service delivery life cycle.
◾
◾Strategies—Provide the actions (how) to achieving the goals for each of the functional areas 
of the IT service delivery life cycle.
◾
◾Programs and Initiatives—Provide programs-capital projects expenses; initiative-operating 
expenses for each functional areas of the IT service delivery life cycle.
◾
◾Benefits—Provide the benefits (what) to successfully delivering the programs and initiatives 
that align with the outcomes for each of the functional areas of the IT service delivery life 
cycle.
◾
◾Cost—Provide cost estimates for delivering the services for each of the functional areas of 
the IT service delivery life cycle.
◾
◾Performance measures—Provide performance measures and results (targets) for each of the 
functional areas of the IT service delivery life cycle.
◾
◾Linkages to business strategic plan, IT operational plan and IT performance management 
plan to ensure that the technology solution is aligned with business goals, objectives, and 
strategies, and measured using the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard.
◾
◾Program delivery plan—Projects, priorities, implementation sequences, performance measures 
and results that support the programs initiatives.
3.3.1  Purpose
The purpose of this result area is to provide a sound and forward-thinking framework for 
the planning, delivery, and measurement of IT services, using a results-based accountability 
framework.2 This framework will form the baseline to measure and monitor the results of the 
delivered IT services within the context of the functional areas of the IT services delivery life 
cycle and the established performance measurement areas. The performance steering com-
mittee will have approval accountabilities for organizational performance—business and IT 
performance program. This committee will also have accountability with the performance 
measurement managers for the operational performance using the IT strategy measurement 
areas defined in the performance management plan and the integrated IT performance mea-
surement dashboard.

3.4.1  Purpose
The purpose of this results area is to provide clear, consistent, and complete strategic direction for 
the planning, delivery, and measurement of the six functional areas of the IT service life cycles, 
using a result-based accountability framework.2 The contents of the strategic directives established 
the foundation to identifying the outputs and outcomes for each of the functional areas. The 
outputs and outcomes formed the major input data source to the integrated IT performance mea-
surement dashboard, which was utilized to measure and monitor the results of the delivered IT 
services. The performance metrics, indicators, variances, trends, and predictive analytics formed 
the basis for sound evidence-based decision-making process, using the established performance 
measurement areas—operational, financial, employee, and customer. The performance steering 
committee will have approval accountabilities for organizational performance—business and IT 
performance program. This committee will have accountability with the performance measure-
ment managers for the operational performance using the IT strategic directives measurement 
areas defined in the performance management plan and the integrated IT performance measure-
ment dashboard.

3.5  IT Policy Framework
Executives shall use the IT policy framework to managing information technology assets and ser-
vices, selecting appropriate IT delivery model, and contracting information technology services. 
This policy framework provides an extensive set of policies, which allows for associated standards 
to be adopted and best practices or guidelines to be developed, to support more objective-based 
decisions. Sound objective judgments require executive management understanding of the mea-
surement, management, and delivery of information technology assets and services, within the 
context of the IT service delivery life cycle and the IT strategic directives. For each of the IT 
strategic directives for the six functional areas of the IT service delivery life cycle—governance, 
planning and administration, enterprise architecture and innovations, project portfolio manage-
ment, applications management services and IT operational support, the major outputs of the IT 
policy framework include the following:
◾
◾Policy—A statement of outcomes of the policy itself for each of the strategic directive within 
the functional areas and the IT services delivery life cycle.
◾
◾Purpose—The reason or result (what) to achieving the outcomes and realizing the benefits 
of the policy.
◾
◾Principles—Provide the actions (how) to achieving the goals of the policy.

ing the policy using the RACI—Responsible, Approval, Consulting and Informed—RACI 
Chart.
◾
◾Definitions—Provide supporting definitions relevant to the policy.
◾
◾References and related policies—Provide references and related policies to support the policy 
statement.
3.5.1  Purpose
The purpose of this results area is to provide an extensive set of policies that allow for associated 
standards to be adopted and best practices or procedures to be developed to ensure that informa-
tion technology assets and services are planned, delivered, and measured. The policy management 
framework9 integrates the policy statement with strategic directives for each of the six function 
areas of the IT service delivery life cycle. The “principles” heading of the policy framework contain 
the associated strategic directives for that policy to ensure integration with IT strategic directives 
and result-based accountability. The clear, concise, and complete policy framework expands upon 
the strategic directives to improve the productivity of employees and service providers.10 The perfor-
mance steering committee will have approval accountabilities for organizational performance—
business and IT performance program. This committee will also have accountability with the 
performance measurement managers for the operational performance using the IT policy frame-
work measurement areas, as defined in the performance management plan and the integrated IT 
performance measurement dashboard.

3.6  IT Governance Framework
Executives shall use the three pillars of IT governance—culture, structure, and process as the 
basis for communicating, integrating, and making evidence-based strategic and operational 
decisions. This decision-making structure shows how decisions are made, who makes the deci-
sion, who is held accountable, and how the results of the decisions are measured, monitored, 
and managed to ensure effective and efficient utilization of IT resources. Sound objective judg-
ments require executive management understanding of IT governance performance, as well as an 
understanding of the integrated components to improve the quality of management and overall 
IT decision-making performances. The major outputs of the IT governance framework include 
the following:
◾
◾Culture: Answers the questions of corporate mindset, shared values, beliefs, attitudes, 
behaviors, and informal rules of the organization. Decision-making culture, feedback, and 
responses will be misinterpreted with flawed assumptions as a result of the lack of proper

understanding of the corporate culture. Culture influences IT governance performance with 
regard to structure and process in understanding how IT decisions are made and delivered 
within the organization. Performance excellence culture must be viewed as an attitude and 
behavior to maintain sustainability.
◾
◾Structure: Answers “who” and “what” question of IT governance. Who are they governing 
and what are they governing. Decision-making structure in several layers of governance—
executive level, program/business process (IT business council/steering committee), techni-
cal operational level (change advisory council).
◾
◾Process: Answers “how” an organization is governed. Performs measurement and communi-
cations of performance results. How did we do? Decision-making processes associated with 
IT as well as the practices (balanced scorecard) and policies used to measure and control the 
way IT decisions are made and delivered within the organization.

3.6.1  Purpose
The purpose of this results area is to provide an IT governance framework11 for decision mak-
ing that uses the three pillars to ensure effective performance measurement, management, 
delivery, and improvement of IT decision-making structure. The IT governance framework 
(decision-making structure) shows how decisions are made, who makes the decision, who is 
held accountable, and how the results are measured, monitored, and managed. This goal of this 
decision-making framework is to ensure effective and efficient utilization of IT resources—
people, process, technology, and financials—and improved organizational performance and 
quality of management.
This IT governance framework integrates with the six functional areas of the IT service deliv-
ery life cycle and the performance measurement dashboard. It is based on ITIL12 and COBIT 
industry—wide guidelines to ensure results-based accountability.

134  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
3.7.1  Purpose
The purpose of this results area is to provide an IT VBPM15 to clearly align operational performance 
with goals and strategic directives while measuring the performance of IT services. This performance 
measurement approach enables increased reporting value in understanding what, where, and how 
the performance of IT organization can be improved. Value-based metrics are developed to fit the IT 
organizational culture, processes, and structures to determine what needs to be measured now? What 
needs to be measured in future? IT VBPM is more advanced than traditional measures in determin-
ing areas of improvements. The integration of the six outputs of IT VBPM with the four measure-
ment areas of IT performance measurement dashboard facilitates an understanding of improvement 
areas that have achieved success and areas that need further improvements. The overall goal of IT 
VBPM is to ensure effective and efficient utilization of IT resources—people, process, technology, 
and financials—and improved organizational performance and improved quality of management.
3.7.2  Strategic Directives
◾
◾IT performance measures will be managed by the IT delivery performance manager and 
delivered by the performance measurement team using value-based IT performance mea-
sures for process improvement, organizational alignment, technology enablement, per-
formance culture, financial performance, and accountability for results. IT value-based 
performance measures integrate with the six IT functional areas, IT strategic directives, and 
operational–functional management outputs in the performance measurement dashboard. 
This IT VBPM will be used to understand measurements that are clearly linked with busi-
ness value to obtain an accurate indication of what is working and what is not working. 
◾◾The performance steering committee will provide performance approval accountabilities for 
the management and delivery of IT VBPM. These VBPM outputs are represented as operations-
leadership/functional management measures in the performance measurement dashboard.
◾
◾All changes to the IT VBPM outputs must be approved by the performance steering com-
mittee. The performance delivery manager will document and present all changes to the 
performance steering committee for approval.
◾
◾The performance steering committee will meet, at a minimum, on a monthly basis to review 
the performance indicators, trends, and analytics for the IT VBPM outputs in the perfor-
mance measurement dashboard. If the overall progress of this output is red or yellow, more 
frequent meetings will be required.
◾
◾IT VBPM will be defined and assessed for each of the six functional areas, integrated with 
IT strategic directives, and delivered using the performance measurement dashboard.
◾
◾Senior managers will be thoroughly familiar with the IT VBPM to ensure consistency in 
delivery across the IT services functional areas.

3.7.4  Results: IT Value-Based Performance Measurement
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for who 
is accountable for what during the delivery of IT VBPM. Results are now introduced to highlight 
the outputs of this IT VBPM results area and related outcomes (what), process flow (how), and 
performance measures (why). It is intended to serve as a reference based on the English language 
interrogatives: Who is accountable for what, how, and why. The outputs/outcomes, process flow 
and performance measures, based on real-world practical implementation, will serve as excellent 
references for the practicing performance managers during measurement, delivery, and reporting 
of IT VBPM outputs and outcomes.

136  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
The outputs/outcomes highlight the key outputs/outcomes for IT VBPM that the performance 
managers use to measure and report progress, during the delivery of the IT VBPM results. The 
outcomes provide impact answers—what difference does the IT VBPM make? The process flow, 
based on real-world practical implementations, is a graphical representation of the inputs, process, 
outputs, and relationships. The IT VBPM model16 shows the foundation measures to assess IT and 
business areas for organizational excellence and communicate the areas of improvements with 
strategic, IT operational, and performance management staff.
The performance measures from the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard 
for IT value-based performance measures outputs/outcomes are illustrated for “IT Enterprise 
Architecture and IT Planning and Administration Services: Operational-FM measures”. 
Appendices A through F provide further details. Performance metrics, indicators, progress, 
trends, and analytics formed the basis for measurements that are clearly aligned with business 
value to obtain an accurate indication of what is working and what is not working to enable 
improved organizational excellence.

3.8  Summary
The strategic management model presented in this chapter describes the results areas of strategic 
management. The “purpose” section provides a statement of the derived result, and the “strate-
gic directives” section provides various guiding principles and major directives to achieving the 
purpose statement, for each of the strategic management results areas. The accountabilities of the 
executive performance manager, performance delivery manager, and performance measurement 
team are presented to demonstrate the integrated nature of these outputs and outcomes in measur-
ing, managing, and delivering IT services. The key strategic management outputs and outcomes, 
process flows, and performance measures provide excellent real-world implementation guidelines, 
which can be referenced and applied to IT strategic management processes.
Information technology staff who are in the process of measuring, managing, and delivering 
IT services with the goal toward integrated performance management should consider the follow-
ing strategic management recommendations, as a framework, to guide them toward successful 
measurement, management, and delivery of IT services:
Figure 3.19  IT value-based performance measures.

Strategic Management Model  ◾  139
◾
◾Establish an IT strategic directives framework that will guide the measurement, man-
agement, and delivery of performance measurement program, to improve organizational 
performance and quality of management, and to optimize the utilization of IT resources.
◾
◾Determine the value of performance measurement to IT and the business based on the 
six areas of performance measurement and the integrated IT performance measurement 
dashboard.
◾
◾Establish a governance model that embraces the characteristics of performance culture, pro-
cess, and structure.
◾
◾Obtain commitments or non-commitments from executive and senior management for 
enforcing the integration of the IT performance measurement dashboard, using Norton 
and Kaplan measures—employee, customer, financials, and operations—leadership, service 
excellence, service delivery, and relationship management.
◾
◾Establish a performance steering committee to provide performance approval responsibili-
ties and accountability for the input, process and output measures, and overall results as 
determined from the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard.
◾
◾Manage and track the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard, determine the 
value of input, process and output performance measures, trends and analytics, and align 
with IT strategic directive and IT policy framework.
The main focus of this chapter is to provide the readers with further details on the strategic man-
agement results areas of the integrated IT performance management framework (IPMF-IT). By 
now, the readers should have gained a fairly good understanding of the integrated nature of these 
results areas. Chapter 6 includes further discussions to show the horizontal integration of these 
strategic management results areas using the IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model. 
Business and IT managers, and academics, especially those with a passion for improvements, 
measurements, and assessments will be able to appreciate the value of this horizontal and vertical 
integration, to better prepare them in understanding performance measurement and management 
in this dynamically changing IT industry.

Management Model
4.1  Performance Management
The function of performance management is to help managers integrate strategic and operational 
performance to ensure that IT Services are managed, monitored, measured, and delivered using 
an outcomes-based performance measurement and accountability framework with continuous 
integrated governance. IT services are managed and delivered using six functional areas during 
the IT service delivery life cycle, and a clear understanding of these functional areas will enable 
managers to effectively measure the results, outputs, outcomes, and services, with the goal to opti-
mize utilization of resources and improve organizational performance. It consists of the following 
results areas:
◾
◾IT service delivery life cycle performance model
◾
◾IT performance management delivery processes
–	 Performance management standards (PMSD)
–	 Performance measurement system (PMS)
–	 Performance management reporting (PMR)
–	 Financial performance management (FPM)
–	 Performance improvement management (PIM)
–	 Performance change management (PCM)
–	 Human resource performance management (HRPM)
◾
◾Performance measurement office (PMO) support

4.2  IT SDLC Performance Model
Executive management shall use the six functional areas of the IT service delivery life cycle perfor-
mance model to guide the implementation of the PMS in alignment with IT strategic directives. 
Outputs, outcomes, goals, strategies, and performance measures are developed for each functional 
area, which formed the basis for developments of IT strategic directives and IT strategic frame-
work. IT service delivery life cycle performance model presented in this book focuses on an inte-
grated governance approach accountability for results, consisting of the following results:
◾
◾Governance—The primary result is executive leadership/governance services (ELS)2 outputs 
and outcomes, which include the governance structure and IT strategic directives.
◾
◾Planning and administration—The primary result is planning and administration services 
(PAS)3 outputs and outcomes, which include strategic and operational plans.

Stephen Covey
The intent of this section is not to provide detailed processes or procedures on the implementation 
of any specific IT service delivery life cycle performance model. There are many excellent books 
on IT service delivery life cycle processes, concepts, theory, and applicability, some of which are 
mentioned in the “Recommended Readings” section provided at the end of this chapter. The main 
objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of the contents (what), purpose (why), account-
abilities (who is accountable for what), and results (what, how, why) of performance management 
and to demonstrate how it fits within the context of the overall integrated IT performance man-
agement framework. The “accountability” section provides results-based accountability for the 
executive performance manager, performance delivery manager, and performance measurement 
team—performance measurement manager and performance specialists. The results sections for 
each of the IT performance management results areas provide the outputs/outcomes (what), pro-
cess flow (how), and performance measures (why) to support the measurement, management, 
delivery, improvement, and integration of the performance management results areas. The perfor-
mance measures from the performance measurement dashboard mainly show staff input metrics/
measures for demonstration purposes. In reality, the dashboard contains results for input, process, 
and output/outcomes measures.
The materials presented in the following sections are organized to support the structure repre-
sented in Figure 4.1. This structure provides a logical and consistent flow of information to enable 
the readers to gain a better understanding and appreciation for the integrated nature of IT perfor-
mance management, as presented in this book.
4.2.1  Purpose
The purpose of this results area is to present an IT service delivery life cycle performance model, 
consisting of well-established functional areas, to support the integrated governance approach to 
accountability for results. This model will form the baseline to managing, measuring, deliver-
ing, and improving IT services, using the IT strategic directives document and the integrated IT 
performance measurement dashboard, within the context of the performance measurement areas. 
The performance steering committee shall have approval accountabilities for both the business 
and IT program for organizational performance. This committee will also have accountability 
with the performance measurement managers, for the operational performance of the six func-
tional areas, using the measurement areas defined in the performance management plan and the 
integrated IT performance measurement dashboard.

146  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
4.2.2  Strategic Directives
IT services will be directed and measured by a performance steering committee for each of the 
functional areas that specify the outputs, outcomes, and performance metrics in the performance 
measurement dashboard. These established functional areas formed the six pillars to measuring, 
managing, delivering, and improving IT services, using the six stages of the IT service delivery life 
cycle: (1) strategy, (2) plan, (3) design, (4) deliver, (5) deliver/support applications, and (6) deliver/
support technology. The transformational performance leadership strategies for the six functional 
areas are based on the following principles:
Outsourcing + innovations = transformation.8
◾
◾The performance steering committee will provide performance approval accountabilities for 
the measurement, management, and delivery of the functional areas, represented as mea-
surement areas in the performance measurement dashboard.
◾
◾All changes to outputs, outcomes, and performance metrics for each functional 
area  must be approved by the performance steering committee. The performance deliv-
ery manager will document and present changes to the performance steering committee 
for approval.
◾
◾The performance steering committee will meet, at a minimum, on a monthly basis to 
review the performance indicators, trends, and analytics for each function area outputs, 
outcomes, and performance metrics as represented in the performance measurement dash-
board. If the overall progress of the output is red or yellow, more frequent meetings may 
be required.
◾
◾The outputs and outcomes for each of the six functional areas will be measured and man-
aged based on operations, financial, customer, and employee measures, identified in the 
performance measurement dashboard and outlined in the IT operational plan with alignment 
to strategic directives.
◾
◾Senior managers will be thoroughly familiar with the outputs, outcomes, performance met-
rics, and indicators for each functional area to ensure consistency and integration in mea-
surement, management, and delivery of IT services.

4.2.4  Results: IT SDLC Performance Model
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for who 
is accountable for what during the delivery of the six functional areas within the IT service delivery 
life cycle performance model . Results are now introduced to highlight the outputs of this IT ser-
vice delivery life cycle model results area and associated outcomes (what), process flow (how), and 
performance measures (why). It is intended to serve as a reference based on the English language 
interrogatives: Who is accountable for what, how, and why. The outputs/outcomes, process flow, 
and performance measures, based on real-world practical implementation, will serve as excellent 
references for practicing performance managers during measurement, delivery, and reporting of 
the six functional areas outputs and outcomes.
The outputs/outcomes highlight the key results for IT service delivery life cycle performance 
model that the performance managers measure and report during the delivery of the functional results 
area . The process flows, based on real-world practical implementations, is a graphical representation 
of the inputs, process, outputs, and relationships. The IT service delivery life cycle performance 
model shows the foundation representation to effectively communicate the integrated components of 
the six functional areas to strategic, IT operational, and performance management staff.
The performance measures from the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard for 
IT service delivery life cycle performance model outputs/outcomes are illustrated for the six IT 
functional areas, using operational functional management measures. Appendices A through F 
provide further details. Performance metrics, indicators, progress, trends, and analytics formed 
the basis for evidence-based decision making to enable improved organizational excellence.
However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.

4.3  IT Performance Management Delivery Processes
The IT performance management delivery processes discussed in this section represent the 
fundamentals to establishing an integrated performance management body of knowledge. 
These fundamentals consist of the culture, structure, and processes and outputs, outcomes, and 
performance measures for standards, measurement systems, reporting, improvements, change 
management, human resources (HR), and FPM key results areas (KRAs). The lack of standards 
and integrated body of knowledge on performance management and measurement leaves room 
for interpretations, false assumptions, and confusion. PMBOK® Guide 5th Edition does not suf-
ficiently address performance management for project management. The purpose of this book is to 
provide that integrated body of knowledge from a strategic, operational, and performance manage-
ment perspective. The focus is toward enabling a culture of accountability for results—results-based 
management (RBM). An accountability culture that transforms from creating and carrying out 
activities to a culture of being accountable for achieving results, meeting goals, affecting change, 
and improving quality of services. An accountability culture toward measuring results rather than 
only measuring resources and activities, toward measuring outputs and outcomes, rather than 
merely counting inputs and outputs. The performance management body of knowledge presented 
here should enhance the materials presented in this book to provide a clearer understanding of 
the integrated IT performance management process, presented as the theme of this book. The IT 
performance management delivery processes presented in this section outline the fundamental 
(c)

Performance Management Model  ◾  153
performance standards, measurement systems, and reporting processes to integrate employee, cus-
tomer, financial, and operational performance measures with the structure of the integrated IT 
performance measurement dashboard.
All organizations are perfectly designed to get the results they are now getting. If we 
want different results, we must change the way we do things.
Tom Northup
The intent of this section is not to provide detailed processes or procedures on the implementa-
tion of PMI-PMBOK performance management process or similar performance management pro-
cesses. There are many excellent books on performance management processes, concepts, theory, 
and applicability, some of which are mentioned in the “Recommended Readings” section provided 
at the end of this chapter. The main objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of the 
contents (what), purpose (why), accountabilities (who is accountable for what), and results (what, 
how, why) of performance management and to demonstrate how it fits within the context of the 
overall integrated IT performance management framework. This framework forms the founda-
tion for the integrated performance management body of knowledge as presented in this book. 
The “accountability” section provides results-based accountability for the executive performance 
manager, performance delivery manager, and performance measurement team—performance 
measurement manager and performance specialists. The results sections for each of the IT perfor-
mance management results areas provide the outputs/outcomes (what), process flow (how), and 
performance measures (why) to support the measurement, management, delivery, improvement, 
and integration of the performance management results areas. The performance measures from 
the performance measurement dashboard mainly show staff input metrics/measures for demon-
stration purposes. In reality, the dashboard contains many combinations of results for input, pro-
cess, and output/outcomes measures.
The materials presented in the following sections are organized to support the structure repre-
sented in Figure 4.1. This structure provides a logical and consistent flow of information to enable 
the readers to gain a better understanding and appreciation for the integrated nature of IT perfor-
mance management, as presented in this book.
4.3.1  Performance Management Standards
Managers and performance specialists shall use the PMSD9 results area to determine the major 
key results and to establish a common understanding of expectations and results for employee, 
customer, financial, and operations performance measures, as outlined in the performance man-
agement program. Executives shall use the PMSD to ensure that an appropriate level of quality, 
effectiveness, accountability, and rewards have been effectively applied to the management and 
delivery of IT services and that performance results has not been reduced to inappropriate levels 
due to political or other performance pressures. Performance management is when an organiza-
tion uses performance measures and standards to achieve desired result. The PMSD presented in 
this book focuses more on managing the quality, effectiveness, accountability, and rewards of the 
results and measuring these results in accordance with customer, employee, financial, and opera-
tional performance measures. PMS ensures that an appropriate level of performance is attained 
that adheres to the company’s IT strategic and operational framework to ensure

154  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
◾
◾Compliance to organizational policies
◾◾Compliance to guidelines and requirements imposed by the service delivery life cycle guidelines
◾
◾Compliance to PMO guidelines, appropriate for use by the performance management and 
measurement plan/program
The major key results of PMS area are
◾
◾Results quality/quantity
◾
◾Results effectiveness/efficiencies
◾
◾Results accountability
◾
◾Results rewards/recognition
◾
◾Performance management plan
There is never enough time to do it right, but there is always time to do it over.
Murphy’s Law
4.3.1.1  Purpose
The purpose of this results area is to communicate expected results in terms of quality/quantity, 
effectiveness/efficiencies, accountability, and rewards/recognition for management and deliv-
ery of IT services. The purpose of standards is to communicate expectations—you always 
expect certain behaviors and actions—accountability, integrity, ethics, quality, effectiveness, 
and efficiencies. Accountability improves the effectiveness/efficiencies and quality/quantity of 
management. PMSD ensure that appropriate levels of quality/quantity, effectiveness/efficiency, 
accountability, and rewards/recognition have been effectively applied to the delivery of IT ser-
vices and that performance has not been reduced to some inappropriate levels because of politi-
cal or other performance pressures. This information will form the baseline to measure and 
integrate the performance objectives of IT service delivery. The performance steering committee 
will use these performance standards as a baseline in assessing the quality of the performance 
results and the overall performance management program.
4.3.1.2  Strategic Directives
◾
◾The PMSD will be maintained at the level that is appropriate for the management and deliv-
ery of IT services. Adherence to PMO guidelines and policies will be objectively verified.
◾
◾The minimum level of performance standards will be established by PMO policies, guide-
lines, and procedures. Specific IT services that require higher performance results will be 
documented in the integrated performance management plan.10
◾
◾The company’s PMSD will be published and readily available. Performance delivery manag-
ers will develop specific variances based upon the results of the IT products and services. 
Variances shall be documented in the integrated performance management plan.
◾
◾Performance metrics will be developed and available as guidelines in delivering results on 
major products and services for each functional area of the IT service delivery life cycle. 
PMO metrics and indicators will also be made available during the development of the inte-
grated performance management plan.

Performance Management Model  ◾  155
◾
◾Performance metrics reviews, with the appropriate management approval, will be conducted 
for each functional area of the IT service delivery life.
◾
◾The performance measurement team will provide recommendations and corrective actions 
for each assessment of the performance results.

4.3.2  Performance Measurement System
Managers and performance specialists shall use the PMS12 results area to determine the major 
key results and to establish a common understanding of expectations and results for employee, 
customer, financial, and operations performance measures, as outlined in the performance mea-
surement plan. Executives shall use the PMS to ensure that an appropriate level of clarity, con-
sistency, and completeness has been applied in determining outputs/outcomes measures, metrics, 
and indicators and that performance results have not been reduced to inappropriate levels due 
to political or other performance pressures. The PMS presented in this book focuses more on 
how to identify, determine, and verify completeness of outputs, outcomes, metrics, and indica-
tors in accordance with customer, employee, financial, and operational performance measures, 
as defined in the performance measurement dashboard. It is similar to the processes outlined in 
KPI® Institute. However, the performance processes presented here demonstrate a more outcomes/
outputs/results-based approach, rather than the traditional activity/procedural-oriented approach. 
The results-based focus on performance measurement, presented in this section, is better suited to 
implementing integrated performance management for management and delivery of IT services, 
because of the dynamic and changing nature of the information technology industry. PMS is

4.3.2.4  Results: Performance Measurement Systems
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for 
who is accountable for what during the delivery of the performance results in support of the per-
formance management system. Results are now introduced to highlight the outputs of this PMS 
results area and associated outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance measures (why). 
It is intended to serve as a reference based on the English language interrogatives: Who is account-

4.3.3  Performance Management Reporting
Managers and performance specialists shall use PMR14 results area to determine the major key results 
and to establish a common understanding of PMR for employee, customer, financial, and operations 
performance measures, as defined in the integrated performance measurement dashboard. Executives 
shall use the performance management reporting system (PMRS) to ensure transparency of performance 
results. PMR presented in this book focuses more on results transparency that provides visibility for 
results-based accountability, an RBM approach, focused on achieving results for employees, custom-
ers, internal process operations, and financials, as defined in the integrated performance measurement 
dashboard. It is based on the performance measures, similar to the balanced scorecard framework, 
published by Norton and Kaplan. PMR is based on organizational excellence for reporting measured 
results using integrated performance management dashboard and results transparency for KRAs to 
ensure that performance reporting results are credible, consistent, and effectively communicated to 
stakeholders. It establishes the basis to ensure effective transparency of performance results. Results 
transparency provides data on how you are progressing from the perspective of the performance 
results. Performance reporting results provide formal written communications between the perfor-
mance measurement team and senior managers. The performance measurement team and perfor-
mance delivery manager will compile the performance reporting results for each functional area, using 
the metrics and analytics from the integrated performance measurement dashboard. The performance 
reporting results for each functional area will be integrated by the PMO into a PMRS and will be dis-
tributed each month to the performance steering committee and to other stakeholders, as appropriate.
The major key results of PMR results area are

4.3.3.4  Results: Performance Management Reporting
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for who 
is accountable for what during the delivery of the performance results in support of the performance 
management process. Results are now introduced to highlight the outputs of this PMR results area 
and associated outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance measures (why). It is intended 
to serve as a reference based on the English language interrogatives: Who is accountable for what, 
how, and why. The outputs/outcomes, process flow, and performance measures, based on real-world 
practical implementation, will serve as excellent references for practicing performance managers dur-
ing measurement, delivery, and reporting of the outputs and outcomes for the performance results.
The outputs/outcomes highlight the key results for PMR that the performance managers mea-
sure and report during the delivery of the established performance results. The process flows, 
based on real-world practical implementations, is a graphical representation of the inputs, process, 
outputs, and relationships. The PMR performance model shows the foundation representation 
to effectively communicate the integrated components of the established performance results to 
strategic, IT operational, and performance management staff.

The Author
4.3.4.1  Purpose
The purpose of this results area is to provide PIM to ensure that appropriate levels of organiza-
tional excellence, feedback/reviews, and KRA have been effectively applied to the delivery of IT 
services and that performance has not been reduced to some inappropriate levels because of politi-
cal or other performance pressures. This information will form the baseline to measure, integrate, 
and improve the performance objectives of IT service delivery and to ensure effective feedback/
reviews of performance results. The performance steering committee will use these performance 
standards as a baseline in assessing the quality of the performance results and the overall perfor-
mance management program.

4.3.4.4  Results: Performance Improvement Management
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for 
who is accountable for what during the delivery of the performance results in support of the per-
formance management process. Results are now introduced to highlight the outputs of this PIM 
results area and associated outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance measures (why). 
It is intended to serve as a reference based on the English language interrogatives: Who is account-
able for what, how, and why. The outputs/outcomes, process flow, and performance measures, 
based on real-world practical implementation, will serve as excellent references for practicing per-
formance managers during measurement, delivery, and reporting of the outputs and outcomes for 
the performance results.
The outputs/outcomes highlight the key results for PIM results that the performance managers 
measure and report during the delivery of the established performance results. The process flows, 
based on real-world practical implementations, is a graphical representation of the inputs, process, 
outputs, and relationships. The PIM results model shows the foundation representation to effec-
tively communicate the integrated components of the established performance results to strategic, 
IT operational, and performance management staff.
The performance measures from the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard show 
the performance results outputs/outcomes for “executive leadership” functional area. Appendices A 
through F provide further details. Performance metrics, indicators, progress, trends, and analytics 
formed the basis for evidence-based decision making to enable improved organizational excellence.

management process. Results are now introduced to highlight the outputs of this PCM results 
area and associated outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance measures (why). It is 
intended to serve as a reference based on the English language interrogatives: Who is accountable 
for what, how, and why. The outputs/outcomes, process flow, and performance measures, based on 
real-world practical implementation, will serve as excellent references for practicing performance 
managers during measurement, delivery, and reporting of the outputs and outcomes for the per-
formance results.
The outputs/outcomes highlight the key results for PCM that the performance managers mea-
sure and report during the delivery of the established performance results. The process flows, 
based on real-world practical implementations, is a graphical representation of the inputs, pro-
cess, outputs, and relationships. The PCM model shows the foundation representation to effec-
tively communicate the integrated components of the established performance results to strategic, 
IT operational, and performance management staff.
The performance measures from the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard show 
the performance results outputs/outcomes for “executive leadership” functional area. Appendices A 
through F provide further details. Performance metrics, indicators, progress, trends, and analytics 
formed the basis for evidence-based decision making to enable improved organizational excellence.

4.3.6  Human Resource Performance Management
Managers and performance specialists shall use HRPM17 results area to determine the major key 
results and to establish a common framework for managing, measuring, delivering, and improv-
ing employee and customer performance measures, as presented in the performance management 
plan, performance measurement plan, and performance improvement plan. It establishes the basis for 
defining HR performance outcomes/outputs, monitoring progress, and evaluating accomplish-
ments. Executives shall use the HRPM results areas as the framework to ensure clear, concise, 
consistent, complete, credible, and reliable staff performance plan, and staff performance measures 
are determined during employees’ performance appraisals. Measurement should be used for the 
purpose of improvement rather than to make judgments or place blame.
HRPM results area focuses on the outputs/outcomes of employees, guides them to achieving 
organizational goals, and assists them in aligning to strategic and operational plans. Appraisal 
without these objectives is a mistake that provides little value to the employees, managers, and 
the organization. HRPM should be integrated into every employee’s and manager’s value system. 
Progressive organizations embrace performance management as a tool to include and link every 
employee and manager to the strategic and operational imperatives of the organization.

184  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
HRPM is sometimes confused with employee appraisal where the employee is rated against a 
set of competencies. The appraisal process does not achieve alignment as there is no objective or 
goal setting at the start of the process. Goal setting is critical to communicating objectives to the 
employee and, therefore, achieving alignment to the strategic directives and operational execu-
tion. In my experience, many managers and executives do not understand the linkages between 
performance management and the strategy to communicate how the strategy cascades down to 
each staff member. I believe a skill gap exist with most IT managers and executives. Some of 
these managers and executives are only familiar with appraisal systems and believe that HRPM is 
all about appraisals. These managers and executives need a solid foundation in HRPM, strategy 
alignment, and objective setting.
And yet, we still find that many organizations persist with once-per-year appraisals. HRPM 
differs from appraisal in many ways. The predominant disadvantage of appraisals is that employees 
(b)

Performance Management Model  ◾  185
and managers are not linked with the organizational strategy, and this issue makes appraisal a 
waste of time in tighter economic times.
The method of implementation of the HRPM initiatives need to consider the elements of employee 
engagement, retention, and innovations to ensure that the initiatives will achieve the desired engage-
ment and retention outcomes sought by the business, in a culture of innovations. The method of 
transforming your organizational culture is through collaborations and transparency. It is constant 
improvement with a team who can translate innovations into added value for stakeholders. Innovations 
are trending in business. How can organizations derive optimum benefit through innovations?
HRPM presented in this book focuses more on HR measurement results to improve organiza-
tional excellence for employees, as defined in the performance measurement dashboard. It is based 
on the employee performance measures, similar to the balanced scorecard framework, published by 
Norton and Kaplan. HRPM must be maintained using consistent, credible, and reliable staff per-
formance plan and staff performance measures for effective implementation. HRPM results provide 
formal written communications between the performance measurement team and senior managers. 
The performance measurement team and performance delivery manager will compile the HRPM 
results for each functional area, using the metrics and analytics from the performance measurement 
dashboard. The HR performance results will form the basis to ensure HR performance improve-
ment for each functional area will be integrated by the PMO into a HRPM system and distributed 
each month to the performance steering committee and to other stakeholders, as appropriate.
The major key results of HRPM are

4.3.6.1  Purpose
The purpose of this results area is to provide HRPM results to ensure that HR PMS are appro-
priately applied to the developments of staff performance plan and staff performance measures. 
The HRPM results must be aligned to the delivery of IT services and that performance improve-
ments have not been reduced to some inappropriate levels because of political or other performance 
pressures. This HRPM information will form the baseline to measure, integrate, and improve the 
HR performance objectives of IT service delivery and to ensure effective staff performance plan 
and staff performance measures. The performance steering committee will use these HR perfor-
mance plans and measures as a baseline in assessing the quality of the HR performance results and 
the overall integrated performance management program.

4.3.7  Financial Performance Management
Managers and performance specialists shall use FPM18 results area to determine the major key results 
and to establish a common framework for managing, measuring, delivering, and improving finan-
cial performance measures, as presented in the performance management plan, performance mea-
surement plan, and performance improvement plan. It establishes the basis for planning, monitoring 
progress, and evaluating expenditures. Financial performance plan consists of budget, year-to-date 
(YTD), actual expenses, forecast expenses, and comments for each of the financial capital and oper-
ating item, outlined in the IT budget plan. Financial performance measures identify how expenses 
will be measured and monitored using the performance measurement plan, IT budget plan, and the 
financial performance area in the integrated IT performance management dashboard. Executives 
shall use the financial (capital and operating) performance management results areas as the frame-
work to ensure clear, concise, consistent, complete, credible, and reliable financial performance plan, 
and financial performance measures are provided during financial performance reviews.
FPM results area focuses on the outputs/outcomes of capital and operating expenses frame-
work to achieving results-based budgeting (RBB)19 and in aligning to strategic and operational 
initiatives and projects. Financial assessments and reviews without these objectives provide little 
economic value to the organization. FPM should be aligned and integrated with every strategic

and operational initiatives and projects. Progressive organizations embrace FPM as a tool to 
include and link every capital and operating expenses to the strategic and operational imperatives 
of the organization.
FPM is sometimes confused with financial tracking where the financials are tracked against a 
budget, using financial coding structures. The financial tracking processes do not demonstrate align-
ment to strategic and operating initiatives—there is no objective or goal setting at the start of the 
financial allocation process. Goal setting is critical to communicating results achieved for expenses 
incurred and, therefore, achieving alignment to the strategic directives and operational execution. 
In my experiences, many managers and executives do not understand the linkages between perfor-
mance management and the financial strategy to communicate how the strategy cascades down to 
capital and operating expenses. I believe a skill gap exist with most finance staff, IT managers, and 
executives. Some of these financial staff, managers, and executives are only familiar with financial 
tracking system using financial coding structures, with no alignment to results. They firmly believe 
that FPM is all about this method of financial tracking. These financial staff, IT managers, and 
executives need a solid foundation in FPM, strategic and operating alignment, and RBB.
And yet, we still find that many organizations persist with financial tracking reviews, indepen-
dent of results. Some deploy activity-based budgeting (ABB)20 with an accounting coding structure 
that has little or no alignment to planned or achievement results, outcomes, or outputs. A nonpro-
ductive and useless exercise based on the traditional financial model that most financial executives 
endorsed. FPM differs from financial tracking in many ways. The predominant disadvantage of 
financial tracking is that capital and operating expenses are not linked with the organizational 
strategic and operating initiatives/projects, and this issue makes traditional financial tracking a 
waste of time in tighter economic times.
The method of implementing FPM needs to outline the elements and killers of IT budget21 that 
affect IT financial resource optimization (people, process/project/information, and technology 
resources) to ensure that IT financial resources will achieve the desired optimization outcomes 
sought by the business, in an RBB culture. The method of transforming your organizational from 
traditional ABB20 to an RBB culture is through IT resource optimization, accountability, and 
transparency. It is huge  financial improvements of a team who can translate RBB into added value 
for stakeholders. RBB is the financial outcomes of IT resource optimization. How can organiza-
tions derive optimum benefit through RBB?
FPM presented in this book focuses more on financial measurement results to improve organi-
zational financial excellence for results accomplished, as defined in the performance measurement 
dashboard. It is based on the financial performance measures, similar to the balanced scorecard 
framework, published by Norton and Kaplan. FPM must be maintained using consistent, cred-
ible, and reliable financial performance plan and results-based financial performance measures 
to effectively implement FPM. FPM results provide formal written communications between the 
performance measurement team and senior managers. The performance measurement team and 
performance delivery manager will compile the FPM results for each functional area, using the 
metrics and analytics from the performance measurement dashboard. The financial performance

performance improvements have not been reduced to some inappropriate levels because of political 
or other performance pressures. This financial information will form the baseline to measure, inte-
grate, and improve the financial performance objectives of IT service delivery and to ensure effective 
financial performance plan and financial performance measures. The performance steering com-
mittee will use these financial performance plans and measures as a baseline in assessing the quality 
of the financial performance results and the overall integrated performance management program.

4.3.7.4  Results: Financial Performance Management
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for 
who is accountable for what during the delivery of the performance results in support of the per-
formance management process. Results are now introduced to highlight the outputs of this FPM 
results and associated outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance measures (why). It is 
intended to serve as a reference based on the English language interrogatives: Who is accountable 
for what, how, and why. The outputs/outcomes, process flow, and performance measures, based 
on real-world practical implementation, will serve as excellent references for practicing perfor-
mance managers during measurement, delivery, and reporting of the outputs and outcomes for 
the performance results.
The outputs/outcomes highlight the key results for FPMS that the performance managers 
measure and report during the delivery of the established performance results. The process flows, 
based on real-world practical implementations, is a graphical representation of the inputs, process, 
outputs, and relationships. The FPM results show the foundation representation to effectively 
communicate the integrated components of the established performance results to strategic, 
IT operational, and performance management staff.
The performance measures from the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard show 
the performance results outputs/outcomes for “financial” measures. Appendices A through F pro-
vide further details. Performance metrics, indicators, progress, trends, and analytics formed the 
basis for evidence-based decision making to enable improved organizational excellence.

4.3.7.4.5  Real-World Scenario
Situation: A major organization that favored the “outsourcing” mode of operations for all 
IT services decided to contract most performance management services rather than using the 
services of “in-house” managers. They experienced situations where a management consulting 
firm seem to operate in a mode of “turning client’s problems into their personal gold treasures.” 
The primary focus of performance management seemed to be concerned with identifying poten-
tial performance issues and recommending solutions with the goal toward generating more 
management consulting hours and, then secondly, focusing on addressing the needs of the orga-
nization. In some cases, many performance issues were identified and packaged into unnecessary 
performance management project labeled as “phase 1 to n” of the original performance project 
name, to hide the real goal, generating more billable hours. The original performance project 
evolved into multiple overlapping, disjointed, and redundant projects, labeled as “phase 1 to n” 
of the original project name, which resulted in an uncontrolled performance management con-
tract situation. The client’s budget escalated exponentially and, as a result, senior management 
decided to address this budget escalation concern by hiring another performance management 
consulting firm whose mode of operation was similar to that of the previous consulting firm, 
but with a more professional style of management. This professional style of management 
consulting recommended the implementation of overly extensive performance management 
processes, including the management consulting hidden agenda. The uncontrolled budget 
environment, which resulted in the identification of performance management projects to 
address the so-called uncontrolled performance issues, continued to manifest itself, and this

organization’s performance management environment evolved to a series of “performance 
issues fire-fighting” reactive mode of operations.
Nothing is less productive than to make more efficient what should not be done at all.
Peter Drucker
Root cause of problem: In this situation, I believed that the root cause of these identified per-
formance problems is the lack of applicable performance culture, structure, accountability, and 
performance management process, to assess, prioritize, integrate, and align these issues with the 
organization’s strategic and operational goals. Management must be aware of the subtle profes-
sional qualities of some consulting firms, whose “hidden” objective may evolve to “turning clients’ 
problems into their personal gold treasures.” These types of management consulting firms usu-
ally provide “labor-intensive” performance management services, with the main focus toward

identifying vague performance issues with justifications for more detailed analysis, rather than 
providing results-based performance management services.
Solution: The solution to this type of situation is the establishment and application of a per-
formance management culture, structure, and processes, similar in content and structure, as 
presented in this chapter. Senior management involvement, approval, and understanding of the 
integrated performance management dashboard are absolutely necessary for successful implemen-
tation. Evidence-based decision using predictive analytics is often the key to managing, measur-
ing, and improving organizational performance.
4.4  Performance Measurement Office
Executive management shall use the PMO report to ensure that all performance deliverables, 
plans, reports, and processes are documented consistently in the PMO repository.23 Managing, 
measuring, and improving performance outputs, outcomes, measures, and reports in the perfor-
mance repository is often the key to ensuring the IT services deliver complete, consistent, and 
integrated deliverables. This process will enhance the communications among the stakeholders, 
internal, and external to the organization.
The performance measurement team, performance delivery manager, and PMO support staff 
will populate the performance deliverables in the PMO repository, according to PMO standards, 
policies, procedures, and guidelines. The performance reports and metrics for each IT functional 
area will be compiled by the PMO using the PMO repository, and inconsistencies will be pre-
sented to the performance delivery manager and to other stakeholders, as appropriate, for correc-
tive actions. The program steering committee will review the structure and contents of the reports 
and will suggest changes to improve completeness, consistency, and integration of the reports, in 
order to enhance the communications among team members and stakeholders.
The PMO infrastructure support process presented in this chapter emphasizes the need for 
consistency and standardization of processes, deliverables, tools, and techniques to ensure an inte-
grated IT performance management environment is effectively implemented. The PMO supports 
the performance measurement team by providing methodology, process deployment, performance 
management training, performance metrics, performance measurement criteria, tools, and PMR 
support, to increase performance measurement team productivity and reusability.
The major key results of the PMO discussed in this chapter are
◾
◾PMO infrastructure support strategy
◾
◾PMO processes and structure
◾
◾PMO management plan24
◾
◾PMO repository (performance management information repository [PMIR]23 and perfor-
mance management information system [PMIS])
◾
◾PMO metrics and performance reporting
◾
◾PMO predictive analytics and informed decision making
The processing components of the PMO, which focuses on common responsibilities, are as follows:
	
1.	Establishes and deploys a common set of performance measurement processes, metrics, results, 
and templates, which saves effort for each performance measurement staff, or each perfor-
mance manager, from having to create these on their own time. These reusable performance 

Performance Management Model  ◾  199
measurement components help performance initiatives/projects start up more quickly and 
with less effort.
	
2.	Builds the methodology and updates it to account for improvements and best practices. For 
example, as new or revised performance measures, metrics, results, processes, and templates 
are made available, the PMO deploys them consistently throughout the organization.
	
3.	Facilitates improved performance measurement team communications by having common 
measures, metrics, processes, outputs/outcomes, and terminology. Less misunderstanding 
and confusion occurs, if everyone uses the same language and terminology for performance-
related work.
	
4.	Provides training (internal or outsourced) to build core performance measurement compe-
tencies and a common set of experiences. If the training is delivered by the PMO, there is a 
further reduction in overall training costs paid to outside vendors.
	
5.	Delivers performance measurement coaching services to keep IT services from getting into 
trouble. IT results at risk can also be coached to ensure they don’t become more risky.
	
6.	Tracks basic information on the current status of IT services in the organization and provides 
performance visibility and analytics to management in a common and consistent manner.
	
7.	Tracks organization-wide metrics on the state of performance measurement and manage-
ment, IT service delivery, and the value being provided to the business. The PMO also 
assesses the general IT service delivery environment on an ongoing basis to determine the 
improvements that have been made.
	
8.	Acts as the overall advocate for performance measurement and management to the organi-
zation. This includes actively educating, selling managers, and performance team members 
on the value gained though the use of consistent and integrated performance measurement 
processes.
In summary, companies are finding that they need to standardize on how performance are man-
aged, measured, and improved by utilizing consistent and integrated processes. They are recogniz-
ing that the process takes much more than just training the staff. It requires a holistic approach, 
covering many aspects of work and the company culture.
Whoever admits that he is too busy to improve his methods has acknowledged himself 
to be at the end of his rope.

The intent of this section is not to provide detailed processes or procedures on the implementation 
of any specific PMO model or similar IT PMO process. There are many excellent books on PMO 
processes, concepts, theory, and applicability, some of which are mentioned in the “Recommended 
Readings” section provided at the end of this chapter. The main objective of this chapter is to 
provide an overview of the contents (what), purpose (why), accountabilities (who is accountable 
for what), and results (what, how, why) of PMO and to demonstrate how it fits within the con-
text of the overall integrated IT performance management framework. The “accountability” sec-
tion provides results-based accountability for the executive performance manager, performance 
delivery manager, and performance measurement team—performance measurement manager and 
performance specialists. The results sections for each of the IT performance management results 
areas provide the outputs/outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance measures (why) 
to support the measurement, management, delivery, improvement, and integration of the perfor-
mance management results areas. The performance measures from the performance measurement

dashboard mainly show staff input metrics for demonstration purposes. In reality, the dashboard 
contained many combinations of results for input, process, and output/outcomes measures.
4.4.1  Purpose
The purpose of this PMO support process is to support the performance measurement team 
with methodology, templates, process deployment, performance measurement training, perfor-
mance metrics, performance measurement criteria, performance measurement tools, and perfor-
mance measurement reporting, to increase the performance measurement team productivity and 
reusability. The PMO staffs advocate the need for consistency, standardization, and integration 
of results/output/outcomes, tools, and techniques to ensure that the integrated IT performance 
management environment is effectively implemented.
4.4.2  Strategic Directives
◾
◾PMO methodology and processes shall be results based-rather than procedure oriented. The 
“processes or methodologies shall be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, 
and Timely) rather than DUMB (Doubtful, Unrealistic, Massive, and Boring).” It must be 
flexible enough, not rigid, so that it can be easily adapted to different performance develop-
ment approaches.
◾
◾Executive and senior management shall commit to using the company’s approved perfor-
mance measurement methodology and processes during IT service delivery.
◾
◾Performance delivery managers shall ensure that all PMO outputs, outcomes, and measures 
are included in the integrated performance measurement dashboard.

4.5  Summary
The performance management model presented in this chapter describes the results areas of per-
formance management.  The “purpose” section provides a statement of the derived result, and the 
“strategic directives” section provides various guiding principles and major directives to achieving 
the purpose statement, for each of the performance management results areas. The accountabilities 
of the executive performance manager, performance delivery manager, and performance measure-
ment team are presented to demonstrate the integrated nature of these outputs and outcomes in 
measuring, managing, and delivering IT services. The key performance management outputs and 
outcomes, process flows, and performance measures provide excellent real-world implementation 
guidelines, which can be referenced and applied to performance management processes.
Business organizations that are in the process of measuring, managing, delivering, and improv-
ing IT services with the goal toward integrated or enterprise performance management should 
consider the following performance management recommendations, as a framework, to guide 
them toward successful measuring, management, delivery, and improvement of IT services.
◾
◾Establish an IT service delivery life cycle performance model that supports an iterative and 
incremental approach, which consists of well-defined IT functional areas to ensure orderly 
management, approval, control, and delivery of IT services.

208  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
The main focus of this chapter is to provide the readers with further details on the performance 
management component processes of the integrated performance management framework model. By 
now, the readers should have gained a fairly good understanding of the integrated nature of these pro-
cesses. Chapter 6 includes further discussions to show the horizontal integration of these performance 
management processes based on an iterative and incremental IT service delivery life cycle perfor-
mance model. Performance delivery managers and performance measurement staff, especially those 
with keen interests toward integrated performance management processes, will be able to appreciate 
the value of these horizontal and vertical integration processes, to better prepare them for measuring, 
managing, and delivering successful IT services, in this dynamically changing IT industry.

Chapter 5
Information Technology 
Operational 
Management Model
5.1  Information Technology Operational Management
The component of information technology (IT) operational management is to ensure that IT 
­services are effectively measured, managed, delivered, reported, and improved, using a results-
based performance accountability framework. It consists of the following results areas:
◾
◾Financial accountability
◾
◾Human resource (HR) accountability
◾
◾Operational process accountability
◾
◾Project management accountability
◾
◾Applications management accountability
◾
◾Technology operations accountability
Figure 5.1 is a graphical representation of the modeling concept that is used to demonstrate the 
structure and relationships of the processing components for IT operational management, from a 
performance management perspective.
The intent of this chapter is not to provide detailed outcomes and processes on the implemen-
tation of IT operational management or similar IT operational management services. There are 
many excellent books on IT operational management outcomes, processes, concepts, theory, and 
applicability, some of which are mentioned in the “Recommended Readings” section provided 
at the end of this chapter. The main objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of the 
contents (what), purpose (why), accountabilities (who is accountable for what), and results (what, 
how, why) of IT operational management and to demonstrate how it fits within the context 
of the overall integrated IT performance management framework. The “accountability” section 

214  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
provides results-based accountability for the executive performance manager, performance deliv-
ery manager, and performance measurement team—performance measurement manager and 
performance specialists. The results sections for each of the IT operational management results 
areas provide the outputs/outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance measures (why) 
to support the measurement, management, delivery, improvement, and integration of the IT 
operational management results areas. The performance measures from the performance mea-
surement dashboard mainly show staff input metrics for demonstration purposes. In reality, 
the dashboard contains many combinations of results for input, process, and output/outcomes 
measures.
The materials presented in these following sections are organized to support the structure 
represented in Figure 5.1. The contents will provide the readers with a logical and consistent 
flow of information to enable them to gain a better understanding and appreciation for the 
integrated nature of IT performance management, as presented in this book. IT performance 
managers should measure success based on financial, HR, process, projects, applications, 
and technology accountability, to optimize resource utilizations and to enable organizational 
excellence.
The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an 
efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied 
to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.

5.2  Financial Accountability
Executives shall use the financial accountability framework1 as the basis for ensuring the commit-
ment that an individual, team, or organization assumes for the delivery of financial results/output/
outcomes and accountabilities. This commitment includes
◾
◾Answering—providing an explanation or justification—for delivery of the financial results/
output/outcomes and accountabilities
◾
◾Measuring and reporting on the performance results
◾
◾Demonstrating and ensuring accountability for the transparency, credibility, integrity, and 
reliability of the financial results
Many organizations overinvest in IT because they don’t have a clear understanding and expecta-
tions as to the intended outcomes and results. Financial performance accountability is a measured 
financial commitment that delivers transparent, credible, accurate, and reliable capital and operat-
ing costs.2 It formed the basis for sound financial management, improved organizational perfor-
mance, and optimized financial utilizations. Decisions regarding IT investments must be results 
based, driven from the IT budget plan and the integrated IT performance measurement dash-
board, as well as an understanding of the components of IT capital and operating costs. IT should 
not only measure success based on revenue and profits generated but also by means of reducing 
expense or cost inefficiencies, to measure financial performance results.
The major outputs of financial accountability include
◾
◾Capital costs (business projects)—To improve financial accountability by committing to 
managing, measuring, delivering, and improving capital costs for IT business projects by opti-
mizing budget allocations, actual expenses, and forecasted expenses.
◾
◾Capital costs (IT infrastructure projects)—To improve financial accountability by commit-
ting to managing, measuring, delivering, and improving capital costs for IT infrastructure 
projects by optimizing budget allocations, actual expenses, and forecasted expenses.
◾
◾Operating costs (technology services)—To improve financial accountability by committing 
to managing, measuring, delivering, and improving operating costs for IT technology upgrades, 
IT licensing agreements, and IT operating agreements by optimizing budget allocations, actual 
expenses, and forecasted expenses.
◾
◾Operating costs (operations services)—To improve financial accountability by commit-
ting to managing, measuring, delivering, and improving operating costs for outsourced IT 
applications management services (AMS), outsourced IT technology operations services (TOS), 
and in-house IT staff by optimizing budget allocations, actual expenses, and forecasted 
expenses.
As a team we ask ourselves, how do we measure accountability.
Dennis Welch
Financial accountability is the same as educational accountability.

216  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
5.2.1  Purpose
The purpose of this results area is to demonstrate and ensure accountability for the transparency, 
credibility, integrity, and reliability of the financial results, using a results-based financial account-
ability framework— results-based budgeting (RBB).3 This RBB framework will form the baseline 
to measure and monitor the financial results of the delivered IT services for each of the IT func-
tional areas, within the context of the financial performance measurement areas. The performance 
steering committee shall have approval accountabilities for both the capital and operating budget 
to ensure financial accountability. This committee will also have accountability with the perfor-
mance measurement managers, for the financial performance using the financial measurement 
areas defined in the performance management plan and the integrated IT performance measure-
ment dashboard.
5.2.2  Strategic Directive
◾
◾IT capital and operating costs will be reviewed by the performance steering committee on 
a monthly basis, using a financial accountability framework that describes RBB. The RBB 
capital framework4 specifies planned value (IT budget), actual costs (YTD), earned value, 
forecasted costs, variances, % complete, and progress indicator for business and IT infra-
structure projects. The RBB operating framework5 also specifies planned value (IT budget), 
actual costs (YTD), earned value, forecasted costs, variances, % complete, and progress 
indicator for technology and operations services to include outsourcing/consultant, staff 
costs, and IT operating costs.
◾
◾The performance steering committee will provide performance approval accountabilities 
for the transparency, sustainability, and results-based delivery of the financial accountability 
framework, represented in the performance measurement dashboard as the finance measure-
ment area.
◾
◾All changes to the financial accountability framework must be approved by the performance 
steering committee. The performance delivery manager will document and present all 
changes to the performance steering committee for approval.
◾
◾The performance steering committee will meet, at a minimum, on a monthly basis to review 
the performance indicators, trends, and analytics for financial accountability framework, rep-
resented in the performance measurement dashboard as finance output and outcomes and 
finance performance metrics.6 If the overall progress of this output is red or yellow, more fre-
quent meetings may be required for financial accountability improvements.

5.2.4  Results: Financial Accountability
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for who 
is accountable for what during the delivery of IT financial services within the six functional areas 
of the IT service delivery life cycle (SDLC) . Results are now introduced to highlight the out-
puts of this IT financial accountability results area and associated outcomes (what), process flow 
(how), and performance measures (why). It is intended to serve as a reference based on the English 
language interrogatives: Who is accountable for what, how, and why. The outputs/outcomes, pro-
cess flow, and performance measures, based on real-world practical implementation, will serve 
as excellent references for practicing performance managers during measurement, delivery, and 
reporting of IT financial accountability outputs and outcomes. The outputs/outcomes highlight 
the key results on IT finance accountability that performance managers measure and report dur-
ing the management and delivery of IT financials. The process flows, based on real-world practical 
implementations, are graphical representation of the inputs, process, outputs, and relationships. 
The IT financial accountability performance model shows the foundation representation to effec-
tively communicate the integrated components of IT financials to strategic, IT operational, and 
performance management staff. The performance measures from the integrated IT performance 
measurement dashboard show “IT finance” measures for the six functional areas. Appendices A 
through F provide further details. Performance metrics, indicators, progress, trends, and analyt-
ics for financial analysis formed the basis for evidence-based decision making to enable improved 
organizational excellence.

5.3.1  Purpose
The purpose of this results area is to demonstrate and ensure accountability from stakeholders, 
customers (IT service providers, vendors), and employees to deliver engaged, committed, credible, 
trustworthy, and ethical human capital resources, as documented in the IT HR plan,8 using HR 
results-based management and accountability framework (HR-RBM).9 This HR-RBM framework 
will form the baseline to monitor and measure the HR performance of the delivered IT ser-
vices for each of the IT functional areas, for customers and employees’ performance measurement 
areas. The performance steering committee will have approval accountabilities for the outsourced, 
contracted, and in-house10 services to ensure HR accountability. This committee will also have 
accountability with the performance measurement managers, for the HR performance using cus-
tomer and employee measurement areas, defined in the performance management plan and the 
integrated IT performance measurement dashboard.
5.3.2  Strategic Directives
◾
◾IT HR resource plan for outsourced, contracted, and in-house10 labor utilizations will be 
reviewed by the performance steering committee on a monthly basis, using the HR account-
ability framework that describes HR-RBM. The HR Results-Based Management framework 
specifies planned resources, IT resource plan (full time employee), actual resource utiliza-
tions, competencies, competencies gap, % complete, and progress indicator for customer 
and employee performance measurement areas.
◾
◾The performance steering committee will provide performance approval accountabilities 
for the competencies, commitment, conformance, sustainability, and results-based delivery 
of the HR accountability framework, represented in the performance measurement dash-
board as customer and employee measurement areas. 
◾
◾All changes to the HR accountability framework must be approved by the performance steer-
ing committee. The performance delivery manager will document and present all changes 
to the performance steering committee for approval.

5.3.4  Results: Human Resource Accountability
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for who is 
accountable for what during the delivery of IT HR services within the six functional areas of the IT 
SDLC . Results are now introduced to highlight the outputs of this HR (customer and employee) 
accountability results area and associated outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance 
measures (why). It is intended to serve as a reference based on the English language interrogatives: 
Who is accountable for what, how, and why. The outputs/outcomes, process flow, and performance 
measures, based on real-world practical implementation, will serve as excellent references for prac-
ticing performance managers during the measurement, delivery, and reporting of HR accountabil-
ity outputs and outcomes. The outputs/outcomes highlight the key results for HR accountability 
that performance managers measure and report during the management and delivery of human 
capital resource utilizations. The process flows, based on real-world practical implementations, are 
graphical representations of the inputs, process, outputs, and relationships. The HR accountability 
model shows the foundation representation to effectively communicate the integrated components 
of HR staff utilizations to strategic, IT operational, and performance management staff.
The performance measures from the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard show 
staff outputs for IT executive leadership functional area using customer and employee perfor-
mance measures. Appendices A through F provide further details. Performance metrics, indi-
cators, progress, trends, and analytics for staffing analysis formed the basis for evidence-based 
decision making to enable improved organizational excellence.

5.4.4  Results: Operational Process Accountability
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for who 
is accountable for what during the management and delivery of IT operational processes within 
the six functional areas of the IT service delivery life cycle. Results are now introduced to high-
light the outputs of this operational process (FM, RM, SD, SE) accountability results and associ-
ated outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance measures (why). It is intended to serve 
as a reference based on the English language interrogatives: Who is accountable for what, how, 
and why. The outputs/outcomes, process flow, and performance measures, based on real-world 
practical implementation, will serve as excellent references for practicing performance managers 
during measurement, delivery, and reporting of operational process accountability outputs and 
outcomes. The outputs/outcomes highlight the key results for IT operational process account-
ability that performance managers measure and report during the delivery of the business/IT 
process reengineering program. The process flows, based on real-world practical implementations, 
are a graphical representation of the inputs, process, outputs, and relationships. The operational 
process accountability model shows the foundation representation to effectively communicate the 
integrated components of process reengineering alignment to strategic, IT operational, and per-
formance management processes. The performance measures from the integrated IT performance 
measurement dashboard show operational process outputs for IT executive leadership using

5.5.4  Results: Project Management Accountability
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for 
who is accountable for what during the management and delivery of PPM within the six func-
tional areas of the IT SDLC. Results are now introduced to highlight the outputs of project 
management accountability results and associated outcomes (what), process flow (how), and 
performance measures (why). It is intended to serve as a reference based on the English language 
interrogatives: Who is accountable for what, how, and why. The outputs/outcomes, process flow, 
and performance measures, based on real-world practical implementation, will serve as excellent 
references for practicing performance managers during measurement, delivery, and reporting of 
the project management accountability outputs and outcomes. The outputs/outcomes highlight 
the key results for project management accountability that the performance managers measure 
and report during the delivery of the business/IT infrastructure program. The process flows, 
based on real-world practical implementations, are a graphical representation of the inputs, pro-
cess, outputs, and relationships. The project management accountability performance model 
shows the foundation representation to effectively communicate the integrated components of 
process reengineering alignment to strategic, IT operational, and performance management 
processes.
The performance measures from the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard show 
project management outputs for PPM functional areas using operational, financial, customer, 
and employee performance measures. Appendix D provides further details. Performance metrics, 
indicators, progress, trends, and analytics on project analysis formed the basis for evidence-based 
decision on project management to enable improved organizational excellence.

5.6.4  Results: Applications Management Accountability
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for 
who is accountable for what during the management and delivery of AMS within the six func-
tional areas of the IT SDLC. Results are now introduced to highlight the outputs of applications 
management accountability results and associated outcomes (what), process flow (how), and per-
formance measures (why). It is intended to serve as a reference based on the English language 
interrogatives: Who is accountable for what, how, and why. The outputs/outcomes, process flow, 
and performance measures, based on real-world practical implementation, will serve as excel-
lent references for practicing performance managers during measurement, delivery, and reporting 
of the applications management accountability outputs and outcomes. The outputs/outcomes 
highlight the key results for applications management accountability that the performance man-
agers measure and report during the delivery of the outsourced AMS contractual agreements. 
The process flows, based on real-world practical implementations, are graphical representations 
of the inputs, process, outputs, and relationships. The applications management accountability 
performance model shows the foundation representation to effectively communicate the inte-
grated components of AMS alignment to strategic, IT operational, and performance manage-
ment processes.
The performance measures from the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard show 
applications management outputs for AMS functional areas, using operational, finance, customer, 
and employee performance measures. Appendix E provides further details. Performance metrics, 
indicators, progress, trends, and analytics for AMS analysis formed the basis for evidence-based 
decision making to enable improved organizational excellence.

5.7.4  Results: Technology Operations Accountability
Accountabilities discussed earlier are brief because they are intended to serve as a reference for 
who is accountable for what during the management and delivery of TOS within the six functional 
areas of the IT SDLC . Results are now introduced to highlight the outputs of technology opera-
tions accountability results and associated outcomes (what), process flow (how), and performance 
measures (why). It is intended to serve as a reference based on the English language interrogatives: 
Who is accountable for what, how, and why. The outputs/outcomes, process flow, and performance 
measures, based on real-world practical implementation, will serve as excellent references for prac-
ticing performance managers during measurement, delivery, and reporting of the technology 
operations accountability outputs and outcomes. The outputs/outcomes highlight the key results 
for technology operations management accountability that the performance managers measure 
and report during the delivery of the outsourced AMS contractual agreements. The process flows, 
based on real-world practical implementations, are a graphical representation of the inputs, pro-
cess, outputs, and relationships. The technology operations accountability shows the foundation 
representation to effectively communicate the integrated components of AMS alignment to stra-
tegic, IT operational, and performance management processes.
The performance measures from the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard show 
TOS outputs for TOS using operational, financial customer, and employee performance mea-
sures. Appendix A provides further details. Performance metrics, indicators, progress, trends, and 
analytics formed the basis for technology operations evidence-based decision making to enable 
improved organizational excellence.

5.8  Summary
The IT operational management model presented in this chapter describes the results areas of IT 
operational management. The “purpose” section provides a statement of the derived result, and the 
“strategic directives” section provides various guiding principles and major directives to achieving 
the purpose statement, for each of the IT operational management results areas. The accountabilities 

258  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
of the executive performance manager, performance delivery manager, and performance measure-
ment team are presented to demonstrate the integrated nature of these outputs and outcomes in 
measuring, managing, and delivering IT services. The key IT operational management outputs and 
outcomes, process flows, and performance measures provide excellent real-world implementation 
guidelines, which can be referenced and applied to IT operational management processes.
IT staff who are in the process of measuring, managing, and delivering IT operations ser-
vices with the goal toward integrated performance management should consider the following 
IT operational management recommendations, as a framework, to guide them toward successful 
measurement, management, and delivery of IT services:

The main focus of this chapter is to provide readers with further details on IT operational man-
agement results areas of the integrated IT performance management framework (IPMF-IT). 
By now, the readers should have gained a fairly good understanding of the integrated nature of 
these results areas. Chapter 6 includes further discussions to show the horizontal integration of 
these IT operational management results areas using IT SDLC performance model. Business, 
IT managers, and academics, with a passion for improvements, measurements, and assessments, 
will be able to appreciate the value of the horizontal and vertical integration, to better prepare

6.1  Introduction
In this technologically advancing world of information technology (IT), we should have the capa-
bility to adapt using performance management processes with proactive and predictive analytical 
cultures that value results-based management (RBM). A more results-driven model-centric1 ­process, 
with a culture of performance analytics-rational evidence-based decision making, must replace the 
traditional negative, judgmental, regressive, and reactive approach to performance management. 
The objective of this chapter is to provide the strategic directives and associated outputs, outcomes, 
and performance measures to support the IT service delivery life cycle (SDLC) performance model 
and to show the alignment with the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard.
The functional areas of the integrated IT SDLC performance model connect the end results 
of the strategic directives with outputs, outcomes, and performance measures represented in the 
integrated IT performance measurement dashboard. This integrated IT performance measurement 
dashboard is structured based on a modified version of Kaplan and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard 
that supports operational, financial, customer, and employee performance measures. The IT SDLC 
performance model, presented in this chapter, also shows how strategic management, performance 
management, and IT operational management results areas are integrated. The more practical, flex-
ible, and innovative approach to effectively manage the delivery of information technology services 
(ITS) is to classify ITS into logical functional areas, using the logical stages of the IT SDLC.
The integrated SDLC performance model presented in this chapter represents further elabora-
tion of the integrated IT performance management framework (IPMF-IT) shown in Figure 6.1. This 
framework is a graphical representation that shows the integration of IT functional areas with strategic 
management, performance management, and IT operational management results areas. The integrated

performance management structure that represents the associations of strategic directive end results 
with the outputs, outcomes, and performance measures in the integrated IT performance measurement 
dashboard, using operational, financial, customer, and employee performance measures. Appendices A 
through F show a software tool implementation of this IPMF-IT RBS, using Microsoft Excel.

6.1.2  Master RBS
This master RBS shows a results-driven model-centric approach to managing ITS that supports the 
IPMF-IT and Kaplan and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard guiding performance measures.
My guiding definition of RBS: “A results-driven model-centric framework of IT strategic direc-
tives that describes the end-results of ITS for IT functional areas, and aligns with the established 
organizational performance measures. Each descending level provides an increasingly detailed 
definition of the performance results, represented in the performance measurement dashboard.” 
The end result and associated outputs, outcomes, and performance measures of the IPMF-IT 
have four distinguishing characteristics: results driven, model centric, analytical, and integrated.2 
IPMF-IT provides the integration between financial (budget, investments, expenses), customer 
(external stakeholders), operations (process, technology), and employee (internal stakeholders) 
performance results, for the IT functional areas. Integrated performance management is when an 
organization uses performance measures and standards to achieve desired results, which is imple-
mented and integrated at the strategic and operational levels. ITS are managed, measured, and 
monitored based on the performance results of the six IT functional areas: leadership/governance, 
planning and administration, enterprise architecture, project portfolio, applications services, and 
technology services.
6.1.3  Real-World Scenarios: RBS
As a result of my 35 years of practical industry experiences as an IT professional in the public, 
private, and academic sectors, I finally concluded that one of the major reasons for the failure of 
ITS delivery in either in-house, contracted, or outsourced3 environments was the result of ineffective

measurement of the delivered ITS. Many IT leaders and managers have limited knowledge of the 
critical factors that contribute to their success. They have contributed to these failures because of 
their inability to apply a performance management process during the management and delivery 
of ITS.
These IT decision makers usually lack understanding and agreement of what is important 
and lack ownership and accountability for performance results. Strategies are poorly executed 
because managers and employees lack the mutual understanding of how the strategy fits with their 
job responsibilities. Operational performances are emotionally managed because management 
decision-making powers of ego, status, and politics are based on educated guesses and best-case 
scenarios. Employees do not understand what is expected of them and how results meet expecta-
tions. Leaders and managers do not know how their employees, customer, processes, and projects/
initiatives are performing in their functional areas, with respect to performance results. The think-
ing preferences of these IT leaders and managers are narrowed to procedural or task-oriented 
focus, with negative and judgmental performance measurement mentality.
They lack real strategic value integration, performance measurement, and transformation 
change management skills and place more emphasis on the efforts, financials, and activities by 
counting inputs and outputs, with little or no regard for the results—outputs and outcomes. In 
most cases, a rigid methodology is applied, with little consideration for “why” or “how” these 
activities should be integrated to producing the results. The concept of RBS or RBM is unknown 
and treated as theoretical, and in cases where this RBS technique is applied, the focus is usually 
task oriented not results based. This is a typical example of misuse of the RBS or RBM guidelines, 
in accordance with the integrated performance management framework defined in this book, 
which is central to organizational excellence, accountability for results, and sustained value cre-
ation. We must hold others accountable for results rather than effort and activities. People look 
busy and accomplish little—being busy is not the same as producing results. The main trust 
of performance management is to make better decisions that will be evidence based and ulti-
mately measured by outputs and outcomes. We need to shift from measurement that is primarily 
designed for effort, activities, and tasks to accountability for results (RBM), with meaningful 
outcome metrics that demonstrate the value of these transformational change—people, politics, 
process, and performance.
6.1.4  IT SDLC Performance Model
The IT SDLC process, represented in Figure 6.3, is a model-centric approach that provides a 
structure for integrating IT SDLC stages, IT functional areas, results areas, and processes. This 
structure integrates IPMF-IT, integrated IT performance management RBS, and IT performance 
measurement dashboard, using the IT strategic directives as the foundation. The alignment of the 
IT strategic directives with the performance measures, and the integration of strategic manage-
ment, IT operational management, and performance management components for each of the six 
IT functional areas, is presented to show the horizontal integration of this performance manage-
ment framework. The flexibility of this framework makes it applicable for “in-house,” contracted, 
and outsourced IT environments because of the sound logical and sustainable IT functional areas.
The objective of this performance model is to establish a framework that will assist strategic, 
IT operational, and performance management staff to consistently use performance measurement 
information to manage, monitor, and measure your organization asset capacity—people, process, 
financials, and technology—during the management and delivery of ITS.

Integrated IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model  ◾  273
Specific objectives when applying this process are to
◾
◾Foster ongoing accountability, transparency, and communications among the strategic, IT 
operational, and performance management staff, to improve performance of IT manage-
ment and delivery services, and to enable a culture of rational evidence-based decision mak-
ing, instead of judgmental or intuitive decision making
◾
◾Provide consistency in determining fundamental performance characteristics of efficiencies 
(outputs), effectiveness (outcomes), and service delivery (quality/quantity), during the man-
agement, measurement, improvement, and delivery of ITS
◾
◾Provide strategic, IT operational, and performance managers with an RBM framework 
based on strategic directives, outputs, outcomes, and performance measurement infor-
mation, to guide in establishing performance goals, optimize IT resource utilization, 
improve or confirm current processes, and report successes on the management and deliv-
ery of ITS
◾
◾Provide a framework of strategic directives, outputs, outcomes, and performance measure-
ment information, which can be refined and applied to meet the performance measurement 
characteristics of a particular IT department

6.1.5  Applying IT SDLC Process
IT SDLC process (Figure 6.3) provides a flexible, logically sound, and sustained approach to the 
management and delivery of ITS. However, ITS environments vary significantly with respect 
to people, process, technology, and financial resource utilizations. As a result, implementa-
tion of this model-centric approach should be applicable to the objectives, strategic directions, 
outsourced/in-sourced model,4 and resource utilizations of the IT environments/departments.
IT managers should apply this process on large- to medium5-sized “in-house,” contracted, or 
outsourced managed IT departments. For smaller-sized IT departments6 with an outsourced and/
or in-sourced model, IT decision makers may combine the life cycle stages or functional areas, 
outputs/outcomes, performance measures, and associated strategic directives to reflect the most 
applicable approach for the management and delivery of ITS.
The demand for a client-centric outsourced7 approach to ITS delivery is becoming increasingly 
important, to support this evidence-based decision-making process, measured by outputs and 
outcomes. Implementing a client-centric outsourced model provides the opportunity for clients to 
collaborate with the outsourced service providers and/or contracted resources (staff augmentation 
model)8 and to maintain a sustained culture of trust, credibility, transparency, and accountability. 
The client-centric outsourced model delivers applications management services (AMS), technol-
ogy operations services (TOS), and special business and/or technology infrastructure projects by 
an outsourced ITS provider, usually awarded through a fixed-priced request for proposal (RFP)9 
process. This model also includes the delivery of project portfolio management (PPM) services 
for business and enterprise architecture services (EAS) for technology infrastructure projects by 
contracted resource-staff augmentation model, awarded through a time and materials RFP10 pro-
cess. The IT industry has struggled to balance innovations with applicability, consistency, and 
stability. Client-centric outsourced model is the framework that provides innovative, cost-effective, 
­adaptable, and practical implementation of the IT SDLC process, discussed in this chapter.
In-house or in-sourced model delivers leadership/governance services (executive leader-
ship ­services [ELS]), planning and administration services (PAS), and enterprise architecture/
innovations services (excluding technology projects—EAS), which have been classified as having 
strategic value to IT and the business areas. The decision to manage and deliver these ITS (func-
tional areas), using “in-house,” resources was based on the “strategic value” policy. In-house or 
in-sourced model requires that accountability for results, ownership, transparency, integrity, sus-
tainability, ethics, and performance management reside with the ITS departments.
In the client-centric outsourced model, client centric can be defined from the perspectives of 
outsourced and contracted-resource-staff augmentation managed services. Client-centric outsourced 
model for outsourced services is usually managed and delivered by outsourced ITS providers11 in 
#3 (special technology projects—EAS), #4 (special business projects—PPM), #5 (AMS), and 
#6 (TOS), as represented in Figure 6.3, IT SDLC process. Client-centric outsourced model for 
contracted resources services is usually delivered by staff augmentation resources in #3 (technol-
ogy projects—EAS) and #4 (business projects—PPM), as represented in Figure 6.3, IT SDLC 
process.
Successful outsourced managed services require regular oversight and measurement of 
­performance results for output and outcomes by the clients, based on the performance ­measurement 
model outlined in the outsourced contractual agreement. Many IT leaders and managers do 
not know how their outsourced services are performing with respect to performance results. 
We must hold our ITS providers and contracted resources accountable for results rather than 
effort and activities. We need to shift from measurement that is traditionally designed for effort, 

Integrated IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model  ◾  275
activities, and tasks to accountability for results (RBM)12 with meaningful outcome metrics that 
demonstrate the value of outsourcing. It is not only about communications as many traditional IT 
decision makers tend to believe. It is about building win–win alliance and trust while ­improving 
performance using accountability for results (RBM).
6.1.6  Real-World Scenarios: SDLC Outsourced Model
Several IT leaders prefer to use their “in-house”-managed services to gain control of their entire 
ITS delivery. Several other IT leaders prefer to use an outsourced approach to transfer control of 
their entire ITS management and delivery to an outsourced service provider. Some IT leaders 
prefer to use a hybrid approach to manage and deliver ITS by gaining control of “strategic value” 
services and transferring control to outsourced ITS providers and contracted resources for project 
delivery and IT operational services, similar to the client-centric outsourced model discussed in this 
chapter.
Many consulting firms that specialize in IT outsourcing prefer to sign contractual agreements 
to manage and deliver IT outsourced services for the entire IT department, similar to the second 
scenario earlier. This usually means transferring ownership and accountability to an IT consulting 
firm–ITS provider. In many cases, these consulting firms usually convince their clients to use their 
(consulting firm) propriety rigid “process-control” SDLC methodologies to manage and deliver 
ITS, with little or no performance measures for any delivered services. Accountability for result is 
nonexistent. Accountability for results is not normally in the best interest of many IT outsourced 
service providers. In many cases, their main interest is to generate revenue, even if this means 
using their propriety methodology to justify excessive management overhead, “change request” 
and “billable hours.” In many cases, this lack of accountability for results is never realized by the 
client–owner, and the contractual agreements usually result in mistrust, “blame” game, and judg-
mental and negative performance measurements.
The major reason for this lack of trust, transparency, and accountability is because of the lack 
of required skills, experience, and knowledge of the IT leaders to convert formulated strategies 
into execution, output, outcomes, and result, to effectively manage, monitor, and measure per-
formance results. Leadership + transparency + accountability = trust; trust and transparency and 
accountability are always linked.
The remaining sections of this chapter provide a real-world implementation of the client-centric 
outsourced model using a results-based, model-centric, and integrated approach that aligns strategic 
directives with IT operational execution, output, outcomes and results, and performance mea-
sures. Modern performance management approaches require a more results-driven model-centric1 
process with a culture of performance analytics13-rational evidence-based decision making, and trust-
ful relationships, which must replace the traditional negative, judgmental, and reactive approach 
to performance management. The client-centric outsourced model provides a practical, flexible, and 
sustainable framework that supports this modern performance management model.
For client-centric outsourced model solution to be deployed or transitioned effectively into the 
entire ITS environment, the following major results must be produced, for each IT functional 
area, as illustrated in Figure 6.3, IT SDLC process:
◾
◾ELS

◾
◾Culture of performance analytics-rational evidence-based decision making
◾
◾Trustful relationships (leadership + transparency + accountability = trust)
◾
◾Integrated IT performance measurement dashboard (intelligent dashboard)
◾
◾Innovative IT performance management framework (flexible and integrated)
◾
◾Strategic directives integration with IT operational execution, output, outcomes and results, 
and performance measures (It is not only about communications, it is about improving 
­performance results by measuring and monitoring outputs and outcomes.)
◾
◾Next-generation performance management
Next-generation performance management is gaining widespread acceptance in this advancing tech-
nological world, because of the technological advancements toward performance management soft-
ware. The transformation to the culture of performance analytics with proactive alert tools, predictive 
performance reports, and automated root cause analysis is also the result of technology advancements. 
The increasing demands to build win–win alliances and trust relationships between clients and ITS 
providers and vendors, and between employees and managers, require collaborative and delayered 
organizational structures, with reduced administrative and bureaucratic overhead. Modern perfor-
mance management practices from KPI Institute, Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI), 
COBIT, Six Sigma, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), Project Management 
Institute (PMI), Kaplan and Norton14 seem to be gaining wide acceptance in the IT industry.
Chapter 7 of this book provides foundation principles and processes on “aligning IPMF-IT 
processes with these industry practices.” I hope this introduction will provide an understanding 
for IT decision makers and professionals and prevent the types of IT decision-making disasters 

Integrated IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model  ◾  277
that normally cause chaos, confusion, mistrust, and bureaucratic reorganization. IT leaders, who 
lack the understanding of the fundamental principles of client-centric outsourced model, usu-
ally try to create new alignments/structures to satisfy their ego, status, and politics. This decision 
normally ends up generating bureaucracy and negativity impacting staff morale and productivity-
degrading performance rather than improving performance.
In order to effectively apply the SDLC performance model presented in this chapter, the 
strategic directives, results, outputs, outcomes, and performance measures that support this 
client-centric outsourced model must be carefully managed, monitored, and measured using this 
IPMF-IT. The functional areas or stages of the SDLC performance model are discussed to show 
how the strategic directives integrate with the performance measurement dashboard and strategic, 
IT operational, and performance management results areas. The major results of the strategic 
directives are highlighted to show the linkage with the outputs in the performance measurement 
dashboard. The matrices, “alignment to performance measures,” provide graphical representation 
of how the IT strategic directives are aligned with the performance measurement dashboard, using 
the results (outputs and outcomes).

Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines 
whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.
Stephen R. Covey
The IT SDLC performance model, also referred to as the IT service delivery life cycle process, con-
sists of six (6) IT functional areas, as shown in Figure 6.3, IT SDLC process. The chief information 
officer (CIO)15 is accountable for the delivery of IT ELS and associated outputs, outcomes, and 
performance measures.
IT ELS provides
◾
◾Strategic directives for executive leadership, contract administration, IT management ­policies 
and procedures, financial management (capital and operating expenses reviews), client and 
vendor relationships, employee progress performance, and customer satisfaction surveys
This functional area produces the following major results, based on the IPMF-IT (Figure 6.1), 
and the IT SDLC process (Figure 6.3), aligned with the integrated IT performance dashboard 
(Appendices A through F). These strategic directives for ELS are updated as ITS are managed, 
measured, and monitored throughout the IT SDLC.

6.2.1  Strategic Directives: Executive Governance
Many IT executives manage the utilization of their resources—people, process, technology, and 
financials—using intuitional and emotional judgmental guesses, which sounds impressive and 
politically attractive, and decision-making powers, with illusions of real efficiencies. In most cases, 

Integrated IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model  ◾  279
there are neither strategic directives nor performance measures to measure success of IT gover-
nance and the entire ITS. The performance culture of improvement is usually foreign to many IT 
executives. They are usually not aware that performance measurement culture adopted by their 
organization with regard to strategy, process, and structure contribute to the success or failures of 
IT governance. Their IT executive’s style of governance/leadership normally focuses on communi-
cations to satisfy their ego, status, and political agendas.
This is clearly the result of lack of understanding of accountability for results culture (RBM). 
There are ineffective communications of the required results (outputs and outcomes) (what), pro-
cesses to produce the results (how), processes to measure the results (why), and people resources (who) 
required to manage and deliver the results. In reality, an atmosphere of confusion, disagreements, and 
conflicting views prevail among the people resources internal and external to the ITS departments. 
Effective delivery of accountability for results starts with an understanding of strategic directives and 
alignment to IT operational execution, using output, outcomes, and performance measures.
Executive Leadership
◾◾ITS will be directed by an IT steering committee using an IT governance accountability frame-
work that specifies the mission, goals, objectives, critical success factors, performance measures, 
and accountability for results (RBM), to direct and measure the success and business value of 
ITS. This governance framework includes transformation leadership strategies (strategic direc-
tives), modeling the way (measuring performance results), empowerment and collaboration, and 
inspiring shared vision, with the objective toward integrating ITS into business areas.
◾
◾HR performance contract for IT staff will be aligned to this “ITS strategic directive” to ensure 
that IT efforts are directed toward the stated goals and objectives. Provide an environment 
that encourages young graduates with competent, committed, and confidence characteris-
tics, to enter the IT workforce.
◾
◾The CIO with IT outsourced service providers will present the progress status to the EM on 
a quarterly or “as-required” basis.
◾
◾IT operational plan (budget) and contractual agreements with the outsourced ITS providers, 
as well as major change requests, will be presented to the EM for approval.
◾
◾The CIO and IT directors will establish and ensure compliance with the IT policies and 
procedures, which include IT project management processes, ITS governance strategies, and 
signed contractual agreements with ITS providers, to ensure consistency in the delivery 
across the business areas.
◾
◾Everyday management of ITS will be managed by the IT directors, using an IT operational 
accountability framework that specifies the strategic directives, critical success factors, per-
formance measures, and accountability for results (RBM) for IT planning and architecture 
services, IT PPM, and IT applications and technology management services.
Contract Administration
◾
◾IT contracts (outsourced and contracted) will be administered by IT contract services group 
(CSG), using IT contract accountability framework that specifies the contractual account-
ability guidelines.
◾
◾Contractors/consultants will sign an NDA and a conflict of interest clause managed under the 
nonemployee security policy and selected through the RFP competitive process. Any excep-
tion will seek approval from the CIO and CSG.

280  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
◾
◾RFPs and contract agreements from ITS providers and consultants will be reviewed and 
approved by the CIO and CSG, prior to execution. RFPs and contract agreements that can 
have major IT infrastructure implications will also be reviewed and approved by the CIO 
and IT infrastructure/architecture standards committee, prior to execution.
◾
◾Records for IT equipment purchases (hardware, software, network, storage, and data ­center 
facilities) will be documented, monitored, and maintained, using the purchasing order 
­system and IT equipment purchasing policies. These records will be used to monitor IT 
equipment expenditures during each fiscal year.
◾
◾Change requests for business projects and technology infrastructure projects will be reviewed 
and approved by the CIO, prior to execution.
◾
◾IT equipment expenditures will be reviewed and approved by the CIO, prior to purchase.
◾
◾IT outsourced/contracted agreements will be reviewed and approved by the CIO, prior to 
execution.
◾
◾Change requests for special business projects and technology infrastructure projects will be 
reviewed and approved by the CIO and CEO, prior to execution.
◾
◾For documents and change requests requiring CIO approval, staff work and business 
­approvals will be completed, prior to seeking CIO approval.
IT Management Policies and Procedures
◾
◾The ITS department will update and communicate IT management policy framework, 
­integrated with the IT governance framework, to ensure accountability for results, 
­operational consistency, and integrity during the management and delivery of ITS.
◾
◾The ITS department will update and communicate IT management procedures, integrated

work, integrated with IT governance framework, to better understand the terms of reference 
for IT business council and associated IT committees, address and resolve issues, communi-
cate and monitor the progress, measure the performance results and value of ITS, and take 
necessary corrective actions for improvements.

6.3.1  Strategic Directives: Planning and Administration
Many IT directors manage the delivery of PAS by spending their efforts on strategic planning, 
IT operational planning, and IT budget planning, with overly excessive administrative overhead. 
Strategic plan, IT operational plan, and IT budget plan are normally disjoined, with no linkages 
to show how strategic plan is executed by IT operational plan and IT budget plan. The concepts 
of RBB are normally ignored. Activity-based budgeting (ABB) using financial accounting cod-
ing structures, without any alignment to strategic or IT operational plan, is the mind-set that is 
understood and accepted. Excessive administrative overhead normally results from frequent inef-
fective planning meetings to satisfy an egoistic manager. In most cases, there are neither strategic 
directives nor performance measures to measure success of IT planning and administration. The 
performance culture of accountability for results is normally ignored or treated as theoretical. They 
do not understand the difference between developing a strategic plan and executing it using an IT 
operation plan and an IT budget plan, with output, outcomes, and performance—accountability 
for results.

Integrated IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model  ◾  287
This is clearly the result of a lack of understanding or resistance to accountability for results 
culture–RBM and RBB. In reality, an atmosphere of excessive planning and administrative over-
head, as a result of disjointed strategic and operational plan, with manual FTS (disjoined spread-
sheets), is the preferred mode of operations. Effective delivery of accountability for results starts 
with an understanding of strategic directives and alignment to IT operational execution, using 
output, outcomes, and performance measures.
PAS Leadership
◾
◾PAS will be directed by a PAS working committee, using an IT operational framework that 
specifies the strategic directives, critical success factors, and performance measures for IT 
planning and administration in order to direct and measure the success and value of PAS. 
The everyday management of this IT functional area will be managed by an IT director, 
using an IT operational framework, which consists of IT strategic planning framework, IT 
operating planning framework, and IT budgeting planning framework.
◾
◾IT directors will ensure compliance with the IT policies and procedures, during the manage-
ment and delivery of strategic plans, IT operating plans, and IT budget plans, using an 
automated FTS16 to ensure consistency and integration with plans and RBB.
Strategic and Operational Planning
◾
◾The ITS department will have a documented IT strategic plan that adheres to IT policy and 
procedure guidelines and aligns with the organization’s business plan. The IT strategic plan 
will include the outcomes, goals, strategies, programs and initiatives, benefits, costs, criti-
cal success factors and performance measures, and linkages to business strategic plan and 
program delivery plan.
◾
◾The ITS department will have an IT operating plan and an IT budget plan that will be 
approved by executive steering committee.17 It must align with the IT strategic plan and will 
be used to guide the budgeting process during each fiscal year.
◾
◾IT costs will not exceed IT budget plan, as represented in the approved budget, unless 
explicit approval is granted through an approved change management process, by executive 
steering committee.
◾
◾The ITS department will provide monthly progress to business areas on the status and forecast 
for cost and schedule of the IT budget plan and recommend improvements to support addi-
tional IT initiatives.
◾

6.4.1  Strategic Directives: Enterprise Architecture Services
Many IT directors manage the delivery of enterprise architecture services (EAS) by spending their 
efforts on architectures (data, applications, technology, and security), and technology infrastruc-
ture projects, with overly complex diagrams and documentations. Architectures and project plans 
are normally disjoined, with no linkages to show how architectures are mapped to IT project 
plans and IT operational plans. The concept of model-based architectures or model-based soft-
ware developments are normally ignored or treated as theoretical. Huge colorful diagrams are 
normally posted on the walls of the ITS departments; to look impressive, without any alignment 
to strategic or IT operational plans, is the mind-set that is understood and accepted. Excessive 
administrative overhead and rework normally result from frequent ineffective planning meetings 
to satisfy an egoistic manager. In most cases, there are neither strategic directives nor performance 
measures to measure success of IT architectures. The performance culture of accountability for 
results with predictive analytics, using big data and analytics18 for insights on decision making and 
predictions, is normally ignored or treated as theoretical. They do not understand the difference 
between architecture development, aligning it with strategic plan and executing it using IT opera-
tional plan, output, outcomes, and performance—accountability for results.
This is clearly the result of a lack of understanding or resistance to accountability for results 
culture–RBM and predictive analytics. In reality, an atmosphere of excessive analysis, architecture 
rework, and administrative overhead prevails, as a result of disjointed architectures, strategic and 
operational plan, and IT infrastructure projects. Effective delivery of accountability for results 
starts with an understanding of strategic directives and alignment to IT operational execution, 
using output, outcomes, and performance measures.

structure (accountability for results), processes and communications, critical success fac-
tors, and performance measures for enterprise architectures and IT infrastructure projects19 
in order to direct and measure the success and value of EAS. The everyday management of 
this IT functional area will be managed by an IT director, using an IT enterprise architecture 
framework, which consists of data architecture, applications architecture, and technology 
architecture (security and privacy), with alignment to business architecture.
◾
◾The EAS director will ensure compliance with the information management framework and 
IT project management governance, during the management and delivery of information 
management and IT infrastructure projects, using automated model-based service-oriented 
architecture software tools to ensure consistency, reusability, and integration with architec-
tures, strategic plans, IT operational plans, and IT projects.
◾
◾The EAS director will chair the technology architecture committee by using the terms of ref-
erence as the framework to guide the identification and resolution of IT architecture and 
business issues.
Enterprise Architecture

6.5.1  Strategic Directives: PPM
Many IT directors manage the delivery of projects by spending their efforts on business projects, 
with overly complex PMO processes and documentations that require heavy administrative over-
head. Project plans and architectures are normally disjoined, with no linkages to show how archi-
tectures are mapped to IT project plans and IT operational plans. The concept of model-based 
software developments is normally ignored or treated as theoretical. Massive unstructured project 
documentation, which normally requires many management approval signatures, in accordance 
with PMO standards is usually the project management mind-set of this IT director. In most 
cases, there are unclear references as to what, why, and how these deliverables/­outputs and out-
comes are produced and measured. Excessive administrative overhead and rework normally result 
from frequent ineffective meetings to satisfy an egoistic manager. In most cases, strategic directives, 
critical success factors, or performance measures are not available in order to measure success of 
IT ­projects. The performance culture of accountability for results with proactive and predictive 

Integrated IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model  ◾  301
analytics, using earned value and trend analysis for insights on decision making and predictions 
for projects cost, schedule, scope, quality, and risk, is normally ignored or treated as theoretical. 
They do not understand model-based iterative software development methods, aligning it with 
architecture, strategic plan, and IT operational plan, using deliverables/output, outcomes, and per-
formance success factors—accountability for results.
This is clearly the result of a lack of understanding or resistance to accountability for results 
culture–RBM with predictive analytics. In reality, an environment of excessive analysis paral-
ysis, project documentation rework, and administrative overhead prevails, as a result of dis-
jointed architectures and strategic and operational plans, for the delivery of IT business projects. 
Effective delivery of accountability for results starts with an understanding of strategic direc-
tives with alignment to IT operational execution, using output, outcomes, and performance 
measures.
PPM Leadership
◾
◾PPM will be directed by a PPM working committee, using an IT PPM governance frame-
work that specifies the strategic directives, decision structure (accountability for results), 
processes and communications, critical success factors, and performance measures for 
IT project management (business projects) in order to direct and measure the success and 
value of PPM services. The everyday management of this IT functional area will be man-
aged by an IT director, using an IT PPM outsourcing framework and integrated IT project 
management framework, which consists of the IT outsourcing strategy and IT project 
management integration processes—business management, project management, and IT 
management.
◾
◾The PPM director will establish and ensure compliance with the IT PPM governance frame-
work and IT project delivery outsourcing framework, during the management and delivery of 
business projects, using innovative project management processes and tools (model based, dash-
board, integrated/agile, etc.) to ensure consistency, reusability, and integration with strategic 
plans, IT operational plans, and architectures (business and technical).

6.6.1  Strategic Directives: AMS
Many IT directors manage the delivery of AMS by spending their efforts on coordinating 
­applications maintenance and enhancement issues log, with overly complex change management 
processes, procedures, and priority ranking system, with little or no understanding of the impact 
of the change to the business and technical environment. Proactive alerts, predictive reports, and 
accurate and automated root cause analysis using software tools are normally ignored or treated 
as too costly and time-consuming. AMS management culture, in most cases, has been reactive-
extensive data analysis. Issue logs are normally posted on the walls of the ITS departments; to 
look impressive is the mind-set of the AMS director that is understood and accepted. There is 
no ­understanding of alignment to strategic and urgent IT operational applications. Excessive 
administrative overhead and rework normally result from frequent ineffective change manage-
ment meetings to satisfy an egoistic manager. In most cases, there are neither strategic directives 
nor performance measures to measure success of applications maintenance and enhancement. The 
performance culture of accountability for results with accurate automated root cause analysis, 
proactive alerts, and predictive reports, using dashboard analytics for insights on decision mak-
ing and predictions, is normally ignored or treated as too costly and time-consuming. Effective 
measures of efficiency and effectiveness include innovations and technologies. The IT industry has 
struggled to balance innovation with stability and applicability. These IT directors do not under-
stand the difference between change and configuration management, applications maintenance 
and enhancements, and alignment with strategic applications and key IT operational application 
output, outcomes, and performance—accountability for results. IT decision makers usually reject 
the idea of client-centric outsourced model, because of perceived lack of power and control and 
status, even in cases where the model-centric outsourced model is evaluated as being cost-effective, 
sustainable, and applicable to the IT environment.
This is clearly the result of lack of understanding of trust, preference to hierarchical command 
and control, and resistance to accountability for results (management culture) with predictive ana-
lytics. An environment of analysis paralysis, applications maintenance and enhancements rework 
with excessive administrative overhead, in a hierarchical management culture of command and 

Integrated IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model  ◾  309
control, seem to be evolving. Effective delivery of accountability for results starts with an under-
standing of strategic directives and alignment to IT operational execution, using output, outcomes, 
and performance measures.
AMS Leadership
◾
◾AMS will be directed by an AMS working committee, using an IT applications management 
governance framework that specifies the strategic directives, decision structure (accountabil-
ity for results), processes and communications, critical success factors, and performance 
measures for IT AMS in order to direct and measure the success and value of AMS. The 
everyday management of this IT functional area will be managed by an IT director, using 
an IT AMS outsourcing framework and AMS innovative technical direction, which consists of 
the IT outsourcing strategy and IT applications management innovative processes and tools 
strategy.
◾
◾The AMS director will ensure compliance with the IT AMS governance framework and IT 
AMS outsourcing framework, during the management and delivery of applications support 
and enhancement services, using innovative applications management processes and tools

6.7.1  Strategic Directives: TOS
Many IT directors manage the delivery of TOS by spending their efforts on technical coordination 
services (technical asset coordination services, problem, incident, change, and release manage-
ment log), with little or no understanding of the impact of change to the business and technical 
environment. Proactive alerts, predictive reports, and accurate and automated root cause analysis 
using software tools are normally ignored or treated as too costly and time-consuming. TOS man-
agement culture, in most cases, has been reactive-extensive data analysis. Issue logs are normally 
posted on the walls of the data center of the ITS department; to look impressive is the mind-set of 
the TOS director that is understood and accepted. There is no understanding of alignment to stra-
tegic and urgent IT operational applications and technologies. Excessive administrative overhead 
and rework normally result from frequent ineffective change management meetings to satisfy an 
egoistic manager. In most cases, there are neither strategic directives nor performance measures 
to measure success of technology asset performance, utilization, and optimization, with respect to 
service delivery, operational efficiencies, and relationship management. The performance culture of 
accountability for results with accurate automated root cause analysis, proactive alerts, and predic-
tive reports, using dashboard analytics for insights on decision making and predictions, is normally 
ignored or treated as too costly and time-consuming. Effective measures of efficiency and effective-
ness include innovations—technologies. The IT industry has struggled to balance innovation with 
stability and applicability. These IT directors do not understand the difference between service cat-
alog and client hardware support and integration with hardware, network, storage, servers, power 
and cooling and management software output, outcomes, and performance—accountability for 
results. IT decision makers usually reject the idea of client-centric outsourced model, because of 
perceived loss of power and control status, even in cases where the model-centric outsourced model 
is evaluated as being cost-effective, sustainable, and applicable to the IT environment.
This is clearly the result of a lack of understanding of technology, preference to hierarchical 
command and control and resistance to accountability for results (management culture) with pre-
dictive analytics. An environment of analysis paralysis, technology support, and upgrades rework 
and excessive administrative overhead, in a hierarchical management culture of command and 
control seem to be evolving. Effective delivery of accountability for results starts with an under-
standing of strategic directives and alignment to IT operational execution, using output, out-
comes, and performance measures.

◾TOS will be directed by a TOS working committee, using an IT operations services gover-
nance framework that specifies the strategic directives, decision structure (accountability for 
results), processes and communications, critical success factors, and performance measures

ment of this IT functional area will be managed by an IT director, using a TOS outsourcing 
framework and TOS data center technical direction, which consists of the IT outsourcing 
strategy and IT operations innovative processes and tools strategy.

directives and associated outputs, outcomes, and performance measures to support the IT SDLC 
process (accountability for results) and to show the alignment with the integrated IT performance 
measurement dashboard. The end results of the strategic directives align with the outputs, out-
comes, and performance measures represented in the integrated IT performance measurement 
dashboard. This integrated IT performance measurement dashboard is structured based on a 
modified version of Kaplan and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard that supports operational, financial, 
customer, and employee performance measures. It also describes how the results areas of strategic 
management, performance management, and IT operational management are horizontally inte-
grated, in accordance with the stages or functional areas of the IT SDLC process.

Integrated IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Performance Model  ◾  323
For each functional area, the strategic directives are provided with highlighted end results and 
alignment to outputs, outcomes, and performance measures in the integrated performance mea-
surement dashboard. It also shows a responsible, accountable, consulted, informed (RACI) matrix 
representation for each functional area that shows how the results area of strategic management, 
performance management, and IT operational management are integrated, using the roles and 
accountabilities. Real-world problems and recommended solutions, for each functional area, are 
also discussed to provide the readers with scenarios of situations for proactive actions.
The real-world implementation of a client-centric outsourced model shows how ITS are man-
aged, measured, and monitored using an RBM framework of strategic directives, end results, 
outputs, outcomes, and performance measures, with predictive analytics evidence-based decision-
making culture. Performance management enables better decision making that is evidence based 
and measured by outputs and outcomes.
IT organizations whose goals are toward managing and delivering ITS that enforces account-
ability for results (RBM) in a client-centric outsourced/in-sourced environment should consider 
the following recommendations, as a framework, to guide them toward successful management 
and delivery of ITS, during the IT SDLC processes:
◾
◾Establish executive leadership/governance services (ELS) functional area, which consists of 
key strategic directives, results, outputs, outcomes, and performance measures that align 
with the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard and integrate with strategic 
management, IT operational management, and performance management results areas, 
similar to the model presented in Section 6.2. Executive leadership establishes a governance 
framework of accountability for results in a performance measurement culture that contrib-
utes to the success of IT governance and ITS delivery. It is not only about communications, 
it is about leadership that builds trust and improves performance results.
◾
◾Establish a PAS functional area, which consists of key strategic directives, results, outputs, 
outcomes, and performance measures that align with the integrated IT performance mea-
surement dashboard and integrate with strategic management, IT operational management,

and performance management results areas, similar to the model presented in Section 6.3. 
Planning and administration establishes an RBB framework of accountability for results 
through alignment to the strategic plan that is executed using an IT operational plan and an 
IT budget plan based on output, outcomes, and performance measures. IT is not about ABB 
with traditional financial coding structure, it is about RBB that aligns with strategic and IT 
operation plans and optimizes the utilization of IT financial resources.
◾
◾Establish an enterprise architecture services (EAS) functional area, which consists of key 
strategic directives, results, outputs, outcomes, and performance measures that align with 
the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard and integrate with strategic man-
agement, IT operational management, and performance management results areas, similar 
to the model presented in Section 6.4. Enterprise architecture establishes an architectural 
framework of accountability for results in a performance measurement culture of predictive 
analytics (big data and analytics).18 It is about aligning architectures (business, data, applica-
tions, technology [security/privacy]) with strategies and executing using IT operating plans, 
outputs, outcomes, and performance measures. IT data centers have traditionally consumed 
high technology resources, which have been ongoing concerns of EM. IT infrastructure and 
business projects using traditional software development processes have failed miserably to 
provide any form of meaningful transition to meet the expectations of both the business 
requirements and the IT design solution. In most cases, the architects or designers are forced 
to rework the analysis, and previous analysis was deemed to be a futile and wasted exercise.
◾
◾Establish a PPM functional area, which consists of key strategic directives, results, outputs, 
outcomes, and performance measures that align with the integrated IT performance mea-
surement dashboard and integrate with strategic management, IT operational management, 
and performance management results areas, similar to the model presented in Section 6.5. 
Project management establishes a model-based iterative software development framework 
that aligns with architectures, strategic plans, and IT operational plans, using deliverables/
output, outcomes, and performance success factors—accountability for results. It is not only 
about communications. It is about building win–win alliance and trust while improving 
performance results in a performance culture of accountability for results with proactive and 
predictive analytics, using earned value and trend analysis for insights on evidence-based 
decision making. One of the critical root causes of failures for ITS departments usually 
occur during project management.
◾
◾Establish an AMS functional area, which consists of key strategic directives, results, out-
puts, outcomes, and performance measures that align with the integrated IT performance 
measurement dashboard and integrate with strategic management, IT operational man-
agement, and performance management results areas, similar to the model presented in 
Section 6.6. Applications management establishes a client-centric outsourced framework in 
a performance-driven culture of accountability for results, with accurate and automated root 
cause analysis, proactive alerts, and predictive reports, using dashboard analytics for insights 
on evidence-based decision making for applications maintenance and enhancements. It is 
about communicating strategic directives and building win–win alliance and trust while 
improving performance results in a performance culture of accountability for results.
◾
◾Establish a TOS (AMS) functional area, which consists of key strategic directives, results, 
outputs, outcomes, and performance measures that align with the integrated IT perfor-
mance measurement dashboard and integrate with strategic management, IT operational 
management, and performance management results areas, similar to the model presented 
in Section 6.6. Technology operations establish a client-centric outsourced framework in a

performance-driven culture of accountability for results, with accurate and automated root 
cause analysis, proactive alerts, and predictive reports, using dashboard analytics for insights 
on evidence-based decision making for technology operational support and operational effi-
ciencies. The IT industry has struggled to balance innovations with stability and applicabil-
ity. It is about communicating strategic directives and building win–win alliance and trust 
with improved IT asset performance and utilization and optimization in a performance 
culture of accountability for results.
6.9  Endnotes: Key Performance Management Terms
1Results-driven, model-centric: An approach to performance management that focuses on a results-
oriented approach to support a client-centric outsourced model for managing and delivering IT 
services.
2Results-driven, model-centric, analytical, integrated: An approach to performance management 
that focuses on the four distinguishing characteristics of IPMF-IT framework.
3In-house, contracted, or outsourced: In-house delivery management and delivery of IT services 
are performed by clients/employees; contracted management and oversight are performed by the 
clients, while the delivery is contracted to external resources, using a time and materials contract 
type. The vendor may or may not assume the role of a project manager depending on the speci-
fications by the client; outsourced oversight is performed by the clients, while the management 
and delivery are contracted to the IT outsourced provider, using a “fixed-priced” contract type, 
with contractual agreements that includes outsourced performance measures. The vendor or out-
sourced IT service provider assumes the role of the project manager because he or she is account-
able for the delivery of performance or quality deliverables, as specified by the client.
4Outsourced/in-sourced model: Outsourced, similar to client-centric outsourced model; in-sourced, 
synonymous to in-house model.
5Large to medium outsourced/in-sourced model: An IT department with a storage capacity of over 
200 terabytes and/or a budget in excess of $100,000/year.
6Smaller-sized outsourced/in-sourced model: An IT department with a storage capacity of less than 
200 terabytes and/or an IT budget of less than $100,000/year.
7Client-centric outsourced model: A strategy that describes how IT services are managed and deliv-
ered, using in-house, contracted, and outsourced delivery methods, based on the functional area 
of the IT service delivery life cycle process, in a performance culture of accountability for results.
8Stagg augmentation model: When the client requires a pool of highly experienced IT professionals 
with a wide range of skill sets, the vendor may supply these dedicated resources to the projects. 
The vendor may be requested to provide a dedicated team trained on the client’s line of business, 
systems, and processes. The client will assume the role as a project manager.
9Fixed-priced request for proposal process: Under this business model, the vendor or IT outsourced 
service provider ensures quality of the delivery of the final product within a prescheduled time 
frame, and the client pays a mutually agreed fixed price for the project implementation. The ven-
dor assumes the role of a project manager because he or she is accountable for the performance of 
the delivery or quality of the deliverables, as specified by the client.

326  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
10Time and materials request for proposal (RFP): Under the time and materials option, the 
­vendor offers its skilled resources, and the development effort is billed at the end of every 
month based on the prenegotiated and mutually agreed hourly rate for contracted work. The 
vendor may or may not assume the role of a project management depending on the specifica-
tions by the client.
11Outsourced service providers: Vendor who provides IT services based on a fixed-priced contractual 
agreements via a competitive RFP process.

Aligning IPMF-IT Framework 
with Industry Best Practices*
Customers require the effective integration of technologies to simplify their workflow 
and boost efficiency.
—Anne M. Mulcahy
7.1  Introduction
Some of the performance management methodologies that seem to be gaining widespread accep-
tance, applicable to the information technology (IT) industry, include The KPI Institute (KPI), 
Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), Control Objectives for Information and Related 
Technology (COBIT), Six Sigma, Project Management Institute (PMI), Information Technology 
Infrastructure Library (ITIL), and Kaplan and Norton (K&N).1 The foundation principle of these 
approaches to performance management is based on a life cycle process to control the dynamic 
environments and to optimize the utilization of resources. The IPMF-IT solution, discussed in 
Chapter 6, has similar characteristics as those of the specified industry best practices. The similari-
ties include life cycle process framework, process optimization, and performance improvements. 
These specific industry performance frameworks integrate with IPMF-IT from the perspectives of 
strategic management, IT operational management, performance management results areas, and 
IT service delivery life cycle process framework. Table 7.1, IPMF-IT integration with industry best 
practices, provides a high-level representation. The objective of this chapter is to discuss industry 
best practices, performance trends, and performance measurement office (PMO) and to show the 
integration of IPMF-IT framework with industry performance measurement frameworks from 
accountability for results or outcome-driven perspective, not to describe the performance manage-
ment processes, as advocated by these professional organizations. There are many excellent books 
on these new and exciting performance management and measurement methodologies, some of 
which are mentioned in the “Recommended Readings” section of this chapter.
*	With appreciated assistance from Kristian Bainey, PMP, BS, MS (Information Systems).

332  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
IPMF-IT and the specified industry performance frameworks are integrated using methods 
and tools (technologies)2 from industry best practices that support the major results areas of strate-
gic management, performance management, and IT operational management within the context 
of IT service delivery life cycle. Effective performance management requires the integration of 
industry best practices to streamline processes, boost efficiencies, optimize the utilization of IT 
resources, and improve organizational excellence. Table 7.1 illustrates the integration, which is the 
theme of this book. This integration is based on these distinguishing characteristics: performance 
framework–measurement driven, results driven, life cycle process driven, IT process framework, and 
performance analytics.3
The IT service delivery life cycle process or functional area or stage, presented in Chapter 6 
and replicated in Figure 7.1, is the foundation model used to define the strategic directives and 
linkages to the integrated performance management dashboard, using output, outcomes, and 
performance measures/metrics, with performance analytics. Appendices A through F provide a 
real-world implementation, using Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
7.1.1  Merits of Understanding IPMF-IT with Industry Practices
During my extensive IT career, I am frequently confronted with misunderstandings by IT pro-
fessionals, on the foundation knowledge needed to effectively apply performance management 
best practices methods, processes, and tools during the management of IT services in delivering 
the expected value and benefits. A major cause of these misunderstandings was the result of lim-
ited skills level of these IT decision makers, including chief information officers (CIOs). They 
seemed to lack strategic value integration (people, process, financials, and technology), transfor-
mational change (people, politics, process, and performance), and performance measurement 
(quality and risk management skills) to effectively apply these foundation concepts in executing 
these processes, tools, and technologies. The symptoms—not the root causes of these failures—
are usually attributed to the technology and supporting process, not to IT management inef-
ficiencies. The inefficient performance management process continues to prevail, without any 
understanding of how to monitor progress and measure the achievement of outcomes/outputs 
and accountability for results.

Aligning IPMF-IT Framework with Industry Best Practices  ◾  333
One of the key functions of management is measuring and managing performance. Measuring 
the achievement of specific outcomes/outputs or evaluation of results is a subset of management. 
Effective management of IT services requires a basic understanding of performance framework–
measurement driven, results driven (results-based structure [RBS]), life cycle process driven, IT process 
framework, and performance analytics. Performance measurement cannot be effectively imple-
mented without an understanding of the basic RBS or results-driven concepts, as defined by K&N 
balanced scorecard (BSC) method. There are some IT leaders including CIOs, in medium to large 
IT departments, who manage IT services without applying performance measurement methods, 
tools, and technologies and who totally ignore concepts such as RBS. These IT leaders have the 
firm belief that concepts such as RBS and results-based management (RBM) and accountability 
for results are theoretical and have no place in the practical world.
IPMF-IT framework, for the delivery of IT services as defined in this book, is executed using 
a life cycle approach, illustrated in Figure 7.1.
Effective implementation of the IT service delivery life cycle process is the result of the 
proper execution of various methods, tools, and technologies to manage, measure, and monitor 
the achievements/results of specific outputs/outcomes for each of the IT functional areas. These 
industry performance management frameworks are mentioned because they fit the performance 
characteristics: performance framework–measurement driven, results driven, life cycle process driven, 
IT process framework, and performance analytics. It would be extremely difficult to effectively apply 
industry best practices to improve IT services without an understanding of how these methods 
fit within the IT functional areas or stages of the IT service delivery life cycle. Some IT leaders, 
including CIOs, manage the delivery of IT services, using data, applications, and technology

lems before it’s too late. They do not ensure that internal controls are effective and efficient. 
Linking IT deliverables back to business goals is not one of their priorities. The value of measur-
ing, monitoring, and improving risks, control processes, compliance standards, and performance 
results seems low. These IT leaders pronounced their not being committed to industry perfor-
mance management best practices, mainly because of their lack of knowledge and skills resulting 
in decision-making styles of intuition, judgmental, and educated guesses. These integrated set of 
performance management frameworks provide the mechanism to bridge the intelligence gap and 
lack of knowledge and skills. In most cases, these leaders don’t really know how well their func-
tion, their people, and their initiatives are performing. I am amazed how many IT leaders pur-
sue the wrong initiatives, survive making the wrong decisions, and usually result in meaningless 
measures. Unbelievably, some of these IT departments continue to progressively function in this 
technologically advancing world.
Incompetents invariably make trouble for people other than themselves.

My main objective of writing this chapter is to provide an understanding on the applicability of 
industry performance management best practices and trends and to show the integration of the 
IPMF-IT framework with industry performance framework from measurement-driven, account-
ability for results, or outcome-driven perspectives. The materials are relevant to those IT leaders 
who have unconsciously contributed to IT service delivery failures of the past. These IT leaders 
and managers continue to unconsciously promote the need for ineffective traditional methods 
in the IT industry; some even disguised themselves as IT management consultants. I hope that 
these practicing IT leaders and professionals will fully accept the reality of technology advance-
ments and applicability and improve their knowledge, skills, and practices to support the chang-
ing accountabilities and responsibilities of IT leaders and managers. One of the key functions of 
management is measuring and managing performance. Performance management best practices 
from the industry, some of which were mentioned in this chapter, can provide invaluable insights. 
These integrated set of performance management frameworks provide the mechanism to bridge 
the intelligence gap and lack of knowledge and skills and integrate these best practices within the 
IT functional areas of the IT service delivery life cycle process.
7.1.2  Key IT Performance Management Trends
Here are some key IT performance management trends in 2015, which can provide valuable 
insights into the knowledge and skill requirements of IT leaders, managers, and performance spe-
cialists, for the next few years. IT is a dynamically changing industry, resulting in the innovative 
nature of this industry. As a result, performance management processes, tools, and technologies 
will need to adapt to these dynamically changing IT environments. However, the fundamental 
principles of performance management such as accountability for results, outcome driven, mea-
surement driven, performance culture of performance analytics, and the ability to predict future 
outcomes will not change—still fundamental. Business analytics is generally accepted as the sci-
ence that involves analyzing data to reveal trends and/or develop insights that can be used to man-
age or predict future performance. These key IT performance management trends are the result of

7.3.1  SM Integration with IT Service Delivery Life Cycle Process
COBIT, an acronym for “Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology,” defines a 
set of generic processes for the management of IT, using a life cycle process. The framework defines 
each process together with process inputs and outputs, key process activities, process objectives, 
and performance measures. The framework supports the governance of IT by defining and align-
ing business goals, IT goals, and IT processes.
COBIT IT governance framework is business focused, process output, control based, and 
measurement driven, which uses accountability frameworks for assigning decision-making 
rights. It provides a set of recommended best practices for governance and control process of 
information systems and technologies with the essence of aligning IT with business. The busi-
ness orientation of COBIT consists of linking business goals to IT goals, providing metrics and 
maturity models to measure their achievement, and identifying the associated responsibilities of 
business and IT process owners.

The purpose of the CMMI model is to assess the maturity of an organization’s processes and 
to provide guidance on improving processes that will lead to improved products, especially in 
software developments. The model was designed to be used as the basis for a process improve-
ment initiative, with its use in assessment only—a support system for measuring improvement. 
It was also designed to produce a map that identifies gaps in existing processes that may need to be 
streamlined. The fundamental building block of CMMI consists of process area that defines goals 
and several activities to support these process areas.
The strategic management results areas from IPMF-IT can apply COBIT framework and 
CMMI maturity model to streamline the processes and improve the results–outputs, outcomes, 
and performance measures for each of the IT functional areas of the IT service delivery life cycle. 
As a CIO, management consultant, and senior architect in the IT industry, I have found COBIT 
and CMMI best practices to be valuable and effective in improving the results–outputs, outcomes, 
and performance measures of strategic management—especially for IT governance framework, 
IT goal statement, and IT strategic framework, and in managing the delivery IT service delivery 
life cycle services, especially the executive leadership/governance and planning and administra-
tion. COBIT and CMMI can also be integrated with ITIL during the improvement of applica-
tions management and technology operations services (TOS), integrated with PMBOK during the 
improvement of .projects, and integrated with Six Sigma during the improvement of architecture 
services—streamlining of internal operational processes.
These industry best practices fit with the performance management trends, presented in this 
chapter, especially performance framework–measurement driven, results driven (streamlining 
RBS), life cycle process driven, and IT process framework. Figures 7.2 and 7.3 illustrate the life 
cycle process–driven characteristics.

agement dashboard. Chapter 6 provides real-world illustrations of how the end results of the 
strategic directives integrate with the outputs and outcomes for each of the IT functional areas or

The key to success is measurement. Measurement is fundamental to high-performance 
improvement and, ultimately, success in business. Think about the critical role of measurement 
in your IT department to guide decision making. Accountability is measured responsibility. 
How do you hold someone accountable without measuring the expected results with the accom-
plished results? Do you understand what you measure? Some IT leaders use measurements to 
promote their self-serving hidden agenda. How (within what context) were the data in the 
dashboard interpreted, used, and applied?

Table 7.4 matrix is an integrated representation on how the industry best practices integrate with 
the performance management results areas from IPMF-IT and the stages or IT functional areas of 
the IT service delivery life cycle process.
7.4.1  PM Integration with IT Service Delivery Life Cycle
KPI is the acronym for “The KPI Institute.” The global authority on key performance indicators’ 
(KPIs) research and education provides, through its publications and training courses, insights 
on how to measure and learn with KPIs. It developed the first KPI Management Framework5 and 
operates several research programs dedicated to performance management, strategy, BSC and 
key performance indicators. It operates smartKPIs.com, where the results of the research program 
dedicated to documenting and cataloging how KPIs are used in practice can be found; it is an 
online portal containing the largest collection of well-documented KPI samples supported by a 
community of tens of thousands of members. KPI Management Framework is a performance 
measurement that is results focused, with the goal to monitor and manage outputs in order to 
produce measureable outcomes by linking objectives with scorecard/dashboard.
In 1992, K&N concept of the BSC revolutionized conventional thinking about performance 
metrics. By going beyond traditional measures of financial performance, the concept has given a 
generation of managers a better understanding of how their companies are really doing. These non-
financial metrics are so valuable mainly because they predict future financial performance rather 
than simply report what’s already happened. This article, first published in 1996, describes how the 
BSC can help senior managers systematically link current actions with tomorrow’s goals, focusing 
on that place where, in the words of the authors, “the rubber meets the sky.” The BSC supplemented 
traditional financial measures with criteria that measured performance from three additional per-
spectives—customers, internal business processes, and employees’ learning and growth.
The fundamental objective of the Six Sigma methodology is the implementation of a mea-
surement-based strategy that focuses on process improvement and streamlining through the 

340  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
application of Six Sigma improvement projects. This is accomplished through the use of two 
Six Sigma submethodologies: DMAIC and DMADV. The Six Sigma DMAIC process (define, 
measure, analyze, improve, and control) is an improvement system for existing processes falling 
below specifications and looking for incremental improvements. The Six Sigma DMADV process 
(define, measure, analyze, design, and verify) is an improvement system used to develop new pro-
cesses or products at Six Sigma quality levels.
The performance management results areas from IPMF-IT apply a modified version of K&N 
BSC approach to performance measurement, KPI Management Framework, and Six Sigma mea-
surement–based strategy for process improvement to streamline the processes and improve the 
results–outputs, outcomes, and performance measures for each of the IT functional areas of the 
IT service delivery life cycle. As a CIO, management consultant, and senior architect in the IT 
industry, I have found KPI, K&N, and Six Sigma best practices to be valuable and effective in 
improving the results–outputs, outcomes, and performance measures of performance manage-
ment—especially for performance measurement systems, performance management reporting, 
and performance improvement in managing the IT service delivery life cycle services. KPI, K&N, 
and Six Sigma methods can also be integrated with ITIL during the improvement of applica-
tions management and TOS, integrated with PMBOK during the improvement of .projects, and

In the preceding section, the value of using performance measurement processes such as KPI, 
K&N BSC, and Six Sigma was discussed. In this section, the value of performance analytics 
and business intelligence is highlighted to show how performance management results areas, as 
defined in this book, integrate with the RBS, based on a modified version of K&N BSC. Table 7.5 
matrix shows the integration of performance management with performance measurement dash-
board. Chapter 4 provides real-world illustrations of this integration, using the integrated IT per-
formance measurement dashboard, to guide decision making. The outputs and outcomes for the 
results areas are aligned with the outputs, outcomes, and performance measures in the integrated 
IT performance management dashboard. Chapter 6 provides real-world illustrations of how the 
end results of the strategic directives integrate with the outputs and outcomes for each of the IT 
functional areas or stages, within the IT service delivery life cycle. Appendices A through F pro-
vide more detailed representation.
The key to evidence-based decision making is predictive analytics. Performance analytics 
is fundamental in the high-performance improvement and ultimately success of the business.

big data, and real-time analytics6 for assessing and predicting performance results and building 
your own dashboard or analytical tools. TDWI Best Practices Report7 focuses on how organiza-
tions can use next-generation analytics. It provides in-depth analysis of current strategies and 
future trends for next-generation analytics across both organizational and technical dimen-
sions, including organizational culture, infrastructure, data, and processes. It examines both 
the analytics and infrastructure necessary for next-generation analytics. On the other hand, 
many measurement systems are designed to justify the salary of top executives—people who 
use the measurement system to get ahead with appearance of success—producing results on the 
wrong measures of success.

Table 7.6 matrix is an integrated representation on how the industry best practices integrate with 
IT operational management (IT-OM) results areas from IPMF-IT and the stages or IT functional

7.5.1  IT-OM Integration with IT Service Delivery Life Cycle
ITIL, the acronym for the Information Technology Infrastructure Library, is a framework for 
IT service management that strives for predictable, maintainable services that align with the 
needs of the corporation or organization. This framework defines the organizational structure 
and skill requirements of an IT organization and a set of standard operational management

procedures and practices to allow the organization to manage an IT operation and associated 
infrastructure. It is the most widely accepted approach to IT service management in the world 
that helps individuals and organizations who use IT to realize business change, transformation, 
and growth.
ITIL focuses on cost and quality improvements in IT services to drive the cost and quality 
improvements in people, processes, and technologies. The fundamental characteristics are process 
oriented and customer-focused based on IT service management best practices.
PMBOK, the acronym for the Project Management Body of Knowledge, is a framework 
and preeminent global standard for project management. It provides project managers the fun-
damental practices needed to achieve organizational results and excellence in the practice of 
project management. The fundamental building block of PMBOK consists of process areas that 
defines a generic life cycle or phases consisting of initiation, planning, execution, monitoring 
and control, and closeout, 47 processes, and 10 knowledge areas that support these process 
areas.
The IT operational management results areas from IPMF-IT can apply ITIL service man-
agement framework and PMBOK project management framework to streamline the processes 
and improve the results–outputs, outcomes, and performance measures for the IT functional 
areas of the IT service delivery life cycle. As a CIO, management consultant, and senior archi-
tect in the IT industry, I have found ITIL and PMBOK best practices to be valuable and 
effective in improving the results–outputs, outcomes, and performance measures of applica-
tions and technology accountability and project accountability, respectively, and in managing 
the delivery IT service delivery life cycle services—TOS, applications management services 
(AMS), and project portfolio management (PPM). ITIL framework can also be integrated 
with PMBOK framework for the improvement of executive leadership services—strategy, and

highlighted to show why the elements of people–culture, process, and technology must be inte-
grated to ensure success. Table 7.7 matrix shows the integration of IT operational management 
with performance measurement dashboard. Chapter 5 provides real-world illustrations of this 
integration, using the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard, to guide decision mak-
ing. The outputs and outcomes for the results areas are aligned with the outputs, outcomes, and 
performance measures in the integrated IT performance management dashboard. Chapter 6 pro-
vides real-world illustrations of how the end results of the strategic directives integrate with the

life cycle. Appendices A through F provide more detailed representation.
As a CIO, management consultant, and senior architect in the IT industry, I have found 
that successful implementation of ITIL and PMBOK performance measurement framework is 
constrained by how the processes and technologies are applied within the context of people 
or organizational culture—behaviors and social measures. I encountered an IT organization 
that enforced a policy to apply ITIL and PMBOK framework in a passive resistance culture of 
performance management—an organizational culture that seems to understand “blame game” 
to identify poor performers rather than poor performances. An organizational culture that is 
more interested to prove rather than improve, to use measurement system to get ahead with 
appearance of success, and to look good on the wrong measures of success (illusions of prog-
ress), with massive useless processes and data that confuse rather than clarify, which produces 
a performance measurement system of confusion. These IT leaders used measurement systems 
that were designed to please top executives—by highlighting good news and hiding bad news. 
My decision was to look at both the positive and negative sides of performance measurement. 
I understood that influencing and changing organizational culture to accountability for results 
and improvement mind-set is not easy and transformation to an outcome-driven or results-based

culture is not immediate. From experience, I fully realized that people tend to behave in their 
own self-interest, especially when their self-interest is being generously rewarded by rewards and 
recognition systems that maintain the status quo, self-promotion, and self-protection. The major 
challenge of talent, trust, knowledge, and collaboration, amidst tensions between IT and busi-
ness leadership, has forced new approaches to delivering processes and technologies, including 
ITIL and PMBOK frameworks.
My objective was to build a performance culture to ensure employees, IT service providers, consul-
tants, and vendors8 are more productive, creative, committed, and engaged. IT leaders must measure 
success based not only on the results of financial measures but also on increase in efficiencies and 
elimination of inefficiencies to resource utilization through process and process-enabling technol-
ogy. IT must measure and track performance results to ensure that the organization is executing the 
strategy to producing the right operational performance results. Cost and quality measurements and 
improvements in IT services using the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard drive 
the cost and quality improvements in people, processes, and technologies. Figures 7.9 and 7.10 from

7.6  Performance Measurement Office Integration
Table 7.8 matrix is an integrated representation on how the industry best practices integrate with 
the key PMO results from IPMF-IT and the stages or IT functional areas of the IT service delivery 
life cycle.
7.6.1  PMO Integration with IT Service Delivery Life Cycle
The performance measurement team, performance delivery manager, and PMO support staff 
will provide process and technical support in applying industry best practice processes and tools, 
according to PMO standards, policies, procedures, and guidelines. The performance reports and 
metrics generated for each IT functional area will be compiled by the PMO using the PMO 
repository and industry best practice processes and tools. Inconsistencies will be presented to the 
performance delivery manager and to other stakeholders, as appropriate, for corrective actions. 
The performance management results areas from IPMF-IT is supported by the PMO and the 
application of a modified version of K&N BSC approach to performance measurement, KPI 
Management Framework, and Six Sigma measurement–based strategy. The goal is to streamline 
the processes and improve the results–outputs, outcomes, and performance measures for each of 
the IT functional areas of the IT service delivery life cycle. As a CIO, management consultant, 
and senior architect in the IT industry, I have found the use of PMO standards, policies, proce-
dures, and guidelines in applying KPI, K&N, and Six Sigma best practices to be valuable and 
effective in improving the results–outputs, outcomes, and performance measures of performance 
management—especially for PMO metrics and performance reporting, in managing the delivery 
IT service delivery life cycle services. KPI, K&N, and Six Sigma can also be integrated with ITIL 
during the improvement of applications management and TOS, integrated with PMBOK during 
the improvement of projects, and integrated with Six Sigma during the improvement of architec-
ture services—streamlining of internal operational processes.

These industry best practices fit with the performance management trends, presented in this 
chapter, especially the following characteristics: performance framework–measurement driven, 
results driven (streamlining RBS), life cycle process driven, and IT process framework. Figure 7.10 
illustrates the life cycle process–driven characteristics.
7.6.2  PMO Integration with Performance Measurement Dashboard
In the preceding section, the value of using the PMO standards, policies, procedures, and guide-
lines, in applying industry best practices such as KPI, K&N BSC, and Six Sigma, is discussed. In 
this section, the value of using PMO metrics and performance reporting for performance analytics 
and business intelligence is highlighted to show how performance management results areas, as 
defined in this book, integrate with the RBS, based on a modified version of K&N BSC. Table 7.9 
matrix shows the integration of performance management with performance measurement dash-
board. Section 4.3 provides real-world illustrations of this integration, using the integrated IT per-
formance measurement dashboard, to guide decision making. The outputs and outcomes for the 
results areas are aligned with the outputs, outcomes, and performance measures in the integrated 
IT performance management dashboard. Chapter 6 provides real-world illustrations of how the 
end results of the strategic directives integrate with the outputs and outcomes for each of the IT 
functional areas, within the IT service delivery life cycle. Appendices A through F provide more 
detailed representation.

350  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
The key to evidence-based decision making is predictive analytics. Performance analytics is 
fundamental in the high-performance improvement and ultimately success of the business. Think 
about the critical function of business intelligence in your IT department to guide decision mak-
ing. How do you interpret the results? Is there measurement confusion? Do you understand what 
you measure? Are you producing results using the wrong measures of success? Are you looking 
good on the wrong measures of success—illusions of progress? Are you producing massive need-
less data that confuse rather than clarify? Do you understand the value of industry best practices? 
PMO standards, policies, procedures, and guidelines, in applying industry best practices, can 
provide the right answers, given the maturity of the organizational performance culture for per-
formance analytics, results-driven, and accountability for results perspectives.
7.6.3  Performance Measurement Dashboard
The focus of this book is on the accountability for results (RBM) perspective, aligning strategies 
with IT operations using output, outcomes, and performance measures and metrics. The strategic 
directives for each of the IT function areas of the IT service delivery life cycle are linked to an 
integrated IT performance measurement dashboard, which generates reports and performance 
analytics for evidence-based decision-making and improvement actions. This book also provides 
real-world insights on the social, behavioral, cultural, and organizational aspects of performance 
management—so crucial to transforming performance measures in your organization. There are 
many books on performance management processes, which can be applied to the IT industry. 
As you may have realized, this book emphasizes transformational change, compliance, account-
ability for results, transparency, integration, and sustainability. These areas are critically important 
in good times to compete in a global economy and essential to the survival of a business in tough 
economic times. The focus is toward measuring and monitoring outcomes, not inputs or activi-
ties, % customer satisfaction, % policies and procedures established, % IT projects successfully 
completed, etc. Yes, I understand, there are cases where we will need to monitor performances

of inputs and activities, such as the number of resources utilized and the number of processes 
streamlined.
The integration between organizations’ financials (budget, investments, and expenses), cus-
tomers (external stakeholders), operations (process, technology), and employee (internal stake-
holders) performance results is not sufficiently addressed neither in theory nor in practice. Also, 
the integration between strategic, operational, and performance managements is not sufficiently 
addressed, neither in theory nor in practice. The lack of standards and integrated body of knowl-
edge for performance management leaves room for interpretations, flawed assumptions, and con-
fusions. The concept of performance management is perceived quite differently in practice and in 
academic research. It is still in the formation stages with no unified body of knowledge outlining 
its structures, results, processes, and boundaries.
This book provides that body of knowledge from the perspectives of integrating strategic, IT 
operational, and performance management results–outputs, outcomes, and processes. It uses a 
logic model to enhance performance through outcomes accountability, relationships among stra-
tegic directives, and accountability for results, outcomes, process flows, and performance measures 
that are guided by the interrogatives: Input, what is invested? Output, what is done? Outcome 
(impact), what is the result? What difference are we making?
The IT industry has struggled to balance innovations with stability and applicability. To exploit 
innovation, we need to better understand the outputs, outcomes, and processes used toward the 
development of a consistent framework. To drive consistency and effectiveness of performance 
across an organization, the best efforts must come together in an integrated performance manage-
ment framework. This innovative IT performance management framework provides that balance 
with stability, applicability, and consistency. I am sure you all will be amazed with the insightful, 
innovative concepts and applicability.
Here are some practical suggestions that you should consider to start transforming perfor-
mance management in your organization that could be applicable to your IT department. These 
tips are categorized based on the elements of transformational change, as defined in this book: 
people (organizational culture), process, politics, and performance.
7.6.3.1  Suggestions for Understanding/Improving 
Organizational Culture (People)
Organizational culture is defined as the system of management styles, decision-making strategies 
and processes, and the ability to change mind-set, shared values/beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors 
of your organization leaders and employees:
◾
◾Promote a performance culture to ensure employees and service providers are more produc-
tive, creative, committed, and engaged. IT must measure success based not only on the 
results of financial measures but also on increase in efficiencies and elimination of inefficien-
cies of resource utilization through process and process-enabling technology.
◾
◾Encourage an organizational culture that promotes and endorses the importance and 
necessity for accountability for results, integrity, and ethics—culture of feedback and 
follow-up.
◾
◾Build an organizational culture that influences IT governance performance with regard 
to the process and structure by measuring the impact and success of decision making. 
Understand the organizational cultural factors adopted by the organization that contributed 
to the success or failures of IT governance model.

352  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
◾
◾Transform a command and control hierarchical structure to a collaborative structure of 
decision making; build win–win alliances between employees and customer service provid-
ers, vendors, etc., through shared purpose and goals of performance measurements.
◾
◾Build a performance culture, mind-set, and value system of improvements to operational 
organizational excellence that will satisfy both good and tough economic times by under-
standing the trends, predictive analytics, and next-generation performance management.
◾◾Traditional performance management is viewed as the reward for few, punishment for many, 
and search for the guilty. Measurement should be used for the purpose of improving rather than 
making judgments or placing blame toward poor performers. Technological advancements 
have enabled innovative cultural solution for the next-generation performance management: 
enterprise data grids—culture of performance analytics.9 The next generation of performance 
management will assess the performance culture, either static, reactive, proactive, or predic-
tive of an organization, and integrate performance culture with trust and transparency, that is, 
leadership + transparency = trust; therefore, trust and transparency are always linked.
7.6.3.2  Suggestions for Understanding/Improving Organizational Politics
Politics from this perspective is defined as self-interest, conflicting goals, loss of power, and hidden 
agenda.
◾
◾Always remember that people tend to behave in their own self-interest, especially when 
their self-interest is being generously recompensated by rewards and recognition systems 
that maintain the status quo, self-promotion, and self-protection (loss of power). The major 
challenges of maintaining talent, trust, knowledge, and collaboration, amidst tensions 
between IT and business leadership, have forced innovative approaches to delivering pro-
cesses and technologies, including performance measurement dashboards, IT governance, 
and operational frameworks such as ITIL and PMBOK. Understanding organizational 
political climate to produce win–win decisions, trust, and consensus agreements with shared 
values/beliefs is a challenge of soft measures, which generally results in stable and sustained 
decision-making processes, that is, accountability + transparency = trust.
◾
◾The behavioral side of measurement—the social aspect of measurement—is sounding 
impressive rather than being effective. Many measurement systems are designed to build the 
ego of top executives—I am sure you know of people who use measurement system to move 
ahead with appearance of success, highlighting good news and hiding bad news. I know 
leaders who use measurement systems to promote their self-serving hidden agenda, normally 
with secrecy style of leadership-hiding and covering-up mistakes.
◾
◾I am sure that many of you know of executives, including IT leaders, who have hired man-
agement consulting firms to produce performance measurement metrics that will justify 
their self-serving hidden agenda. Some of these management consulting firms, with heavy 
political connections to executives and IT leaders, market their services as futurist’s transfor-
mation change agents, emphasizing the use of the greatest hyped performance management 
solutions on the market.
7.6.3.3  Suggestions for Understanding/Improving Organizational Process
The organizational process from performance management context is defined as the internal pro-
cesses and controls used to measure and streamline how services are performed to achieve the 
results—what (outputs) and why (outcomes):

Aligning IPMF-IT Framework with Industry Best Practices  ◾  353
◾
◾Build the framework of performance management process using the concepts of perfor-
mance measures, input measures, and data sources (customer, employee, operations, finan-
cials); outputs/outcomes measure the results (what/why), while the process measures how 
the services are performed.
◾
◾Optimize the effectiveness and efficiencies of internal processes by benchmarking—com-
parison with similar industries/organizations, client satisfaction surveys and feedbacks from 
internal and external stakeholders, and comparisons with industry best practices.
◾
◾To drive consistency and effectiveness of performance across an organization, the best 
efforts must come together in an integrated performance management framework. This 
innovative IT performance management framework, defined in this book, provides 
that balance with stability, applicability, and consistency, using suggested processes and 
industry best practices. Does management ensure that internal controls are effective and 
efficient?
7.6.3.4  Suggestions for Understanding/Improving 
Organizational Performance
Organizational performance is what you do with the information you’ve developed from measur-
ing performance. Performance management means using performance measurement information 
to manage your IT resources—people, processes, technologies, and financials. Performance means 
to perform and account for results. Accountability means effectiveness/efficiencies of services using 
quality/quantity of management to change/improve services.
◾
◾Performance management is the use of performance measure information to establish 
performance goals and success factors, allocate and prioritize resources, inform manag-
ers to either confirm or change current processes, assess your organization asset capacity, 
assign and assess accountability, improve work quality, track progress, and report success. 
Reporting–continuous communications for improvement to service delivery.
◾
◾Focus on soft performance measures—organizational culture, power distribution, politi-
cal climate, social accountabilities and responsibilities, leadership, trust, transparency, and 
other cultural factors.
◾
◾Establish hard performance management indicators—financial, productivity, internal pro-
cess effectiveness/efficiencies, quality/quantity of production, and management.
◾
◾Research and understand performance management trends and automation of performance 
management—transparency reporting and collaboration tools and technologies.
◾
◾Focus on managing, monitoring, and measuring IT performance based on strategic align-
ment with IT operational execution, using accountability for results—RBM and RBB10—
with predictive performance analytic tools and technologies.
◾
◾Do not develop metrics in a vacuum—metrics that do not show how IT is performing 
against a goal—with many useless and meaningless metrics that sound impressive.
◾
◾Build foundation measurement process and structure on how to interpret the metrics; not 
many metrics, many meetings; poorly designed metrics that lack baseline; misleading and 
useless measures.
◾
◾Align strategic directive measures with operational execution measures using an integrated 
measurement dashboard, with metrics to show not only where IT is trending-proactive and 
predictive but also where IT has been reactive and static.

354  ◾  Integrated IT Performance Management
◾
◾Integration of performance management with the IT service delivery life cycle performance 
model and industry best practices.
◾
◾Performance management body of knowledge11 and PMO as the framework for managing the 
delivery of IT services, using integration and applicability of intellectual/cognitive intel-
ligence (logic model), emotional intelligence (culture/people), and economic intelligence 
(IT resource utilizations).
7.6.3.5  Suggestions for Understanding/Improving IT Leaders
We live in a globalized economy with technological advancements—dynamically changing orga-
nizations that still use antiquated organizational change management practices. Resistance to 
change continues to prevail because many IT leaders promote a culture that maintains the status 
quo, self-promotion, and self-protection (loss of power). We should realize that change is inevitable 
and an entire cultural change (mind-set, shared values/beliefs, attitudes/behaviors) is needed, not 
a transformational change initiative, delegated to an internal or external (consulting firm) team, 
sponsored by an executive to satisfy his or her self-serving hidden agenda.
This dynamically changing IT industry needs a set of next-generation leaders who under-
stand why change is important to the business and who is accountable in implementing it, using 
accountability for results. These next-generation leaders must understand the culture of their 
employees relative to mobile computing and the ability to transform to productivity tools such as 
cloud computing and predictive analytics and ability to transform from measuring activities to 
measuring outputs (what) and outcomes (why).
Do you believe that your traditional human resource annual performance review process is 
an effective measure of your performance? Do you believe that improvements are needed for this 
reward and recognition system? Are you one of those who are generously rewarded each year for 
successes because you satisfy an egoistic and politically attractive executive?
I believe most organizations, including IT departments, need to revisit the ways they measure 
success. They need to radically transform the traditional human resource annual performance 
review process to one that measures the strategic directives/goals of the organization that is linked 
to employees, customers, internal processes, and financial measures.
IT leaders need to truly understand the opportunity that technological advancements 
provide and its importance in creating the next-generation performance management environ-
ment. They need to rely less on these services of futurist’s transformation change agents who 
emphasize the need for the greatest hyped solution on the market, in their management consulting 
practice. They need to transform from the traditional antiquated change management practices to 
a transformation change model of people, politics, process, and performance, as suggested in this 
performance management framework. CIOs need to analyze performance management trends 
and prepare their leaders for the next-generation performance measurement practices, not the 
greatest hyped performance management best practices.
A repeating theme throughout this book has been the need for effectively managing, measur-
ing, and monitoring IT leadership to ensure successful delivery of IT services, using accountability 
for results—RBM. An integrated IT performance management framework was defined, within 
the context of strategic, IT operational, and performance management. The applicability of this 
framework within the IT service delivery life cycle, using an innovative client-centric outsourced 
model and specified industry best practices, is provided with real-world illustrations.
I hope this book helped you start thinking about what you are doing and the transformation 
you need to make. I leave you with one question: Are you ready to look at the management of IT 

Aligning IPMF-IT Framework with Industry Best Practices  ◾  355
resources—people, processes, technologies, and financials—from the accountability for results 
perspectives? Are you ready to link IT strategic directives to IT operational execution, using an 
integrated IT performance measurement dashboard? Are you ready to adopt the client-centric 
outsourced model to the management and delivery of IT services, using the IT service delivery life 
cycle? Are you ready to integrate industry best practices in the IT service delivery life cycle? Are you 
ready to apply performance predictive analytics for evidence-based decision making? Are you ready 
to start transforming your organization and IT department to a results-driven performance man-
agement and measurement culture? What do you think of the 4 Ps to transformational change?
Whatever you do, think big, start small, and gain momentum through repeated successes. 
Always use a logic model that fits the organizational culture—integration of emotional, intellec-
tual, and economic intelligence. Economic intelligence12 is the optimized utilization of IT resources.

7.7  Summary
The IPMF-IT alignment with specified industry best practices presented in this chapter describes 
how the components of IPMF-IT framework and specified industry best practices are aligned, 
based on the IT functional areas or stages of the IT service delivery life cycle process. For each 
of the major results area of IPMF-IT, the integration with IT service delivery life cycle is dem-
onstrated, based on the methods and tools of the specified industry best practices. Also, the 
integration of the results areas with integrated IT performance measurement dashboard is also 
demonstrated. Performance management trends and recommended solutions for PMO support 
services, using real-world scenarios, are also discussed to provide the readers with scenarios of 
situations for proactive actions. Suggestions for transforming performance management in your 
organization based on people, politics, process, and performance understanding/improvement are 
presented to provide readers and IT leaders, including CIOs, tips on how to transform to a perfor-
mance management organizational culture of excellence.
Leaders at IT organizations or departments who plan to start transforming performance 
management in their organization should consider the suggestions provided on transformational 
change model—people, politics, process, and performance—as presented in this book. The sug-
gestions provide practical insights on when and how to transform to performance management 
to ensure a high probability of success during the management and delivery of IT services. The 
value of aligning specified industry best practices with each of the IT functional areas will provide 
decision makers with an understanding of how and when these methods and tools fit within the 
context of the IT service delivery life cycle. The purpose of integrating evidence-based decisions of 
industry best practices is to prepare IT leaders for the next-generation performance measurement 
practices, not hyped performance management best practices.

Appendix A: Integrated IT 
Performance Measurement 
Dashboard—Executive 
Leadership Services (ELS)*
A real-world illustration of the integrated IT performance measurement dashboard is provided 
using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to demonstrate implementation of this results breakdown 
structure (RBS). It shows the practical applicability of using this RBS as the foundation struc-
ture, during the management and delivery of IT services, for each IT functional area within the 
IT service delivery life cycle. The end results or deliverables of the strategic directives framework 
defined in Chapter 6 link with the outputs, outcomes, indicators, and performance measures/
metrics in the integrated IT performance dashboard, using a modified version of Kaplan and 
Norton’s Balanced Scorecard performance measurement framework. An example of progress 
analytics is illustrated in the executive leadership dashboard, and an example of performance 
measures/metrics is illustrated in the planning and administration dashboard.
My website www.IPMF-IT.com contains more details on the implementation of this integrated 
IT performance measurement dashboard. It also includes many presentations, practical articles, 
white papers, and dashboards that I am sure you will find useful, informative, and insightful. 
This framework can be used as the fundamental structure in the design and implementation of 
performance management software systems or the start of a new performance management body 
of knowledge—performance excellence body of knowledge (PEBOK, performance management 
body of knowledge).

“I am impressed with Ken Bainey’s approach to integrated IT performance management. 
His practical approach to accountability for results, by aligning strategy to execution using 
a performance measurement dashboard, is revealing and insightful. This book provides that 
understanding of how to apply results-based management and results-based budgeting to 
transform your IT organization to a culture of performance excellence.”
—Ken Maharaj, former CIO, Bishop’s University, Sherbrooke, Canada
If you are in search of real-world practical scenarios of IT performance management prac­
tices, with a desire to obtain examples of strategic directives, accountabilities, outcomes, 
and performance measures for managing IT services, with an interest toward how perfor­
mance management integrates with strategic and operational management, then Integrated 
IT Performance Management is the perfect book for you.
Unlike theoretical books that focus on human resources performance management, this book 
presents a compilation of the author’s extensive IT management, performance management, 
project management, enterprise architecture, and applications development knowledge and 
skills, and industry experiences gained over more than 35 years as an IT professional in the 
private, public, and academic sectors in Canada and the United States.
It provides an Integrated IT Performance Management Framework (IPMF-IT)™ that inte­
grates strategic, IT operational, and performance management components based on a re­
sults-driven performance measurement and accountability framework. It also demonstrates 
the applicability of this framework within the context of the entire IT services delivery life 
cycle, using a model-centric approach. A unique and innovative aspect of this model is the 
alignment of outcome measures with output measures, which focuses on the effectiveness 
and efficiencies of output measures to the management, measurement, and delivery of IT 
services, using integrated IT performance measurement dashboards.
