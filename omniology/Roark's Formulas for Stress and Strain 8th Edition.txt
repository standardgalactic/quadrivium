Preface to the Eighth Edition
I
n recent years, it has been recognized that the use of computers and the incorporation 
of computational mechanics, with graphic pre- and post-processors, has dominated 
the engineering profession. However, the very essence of engineering is rooted in 
the power of classical closed-form solutions and established analytical methods. It is 
these two components that uphold the main woven fabrics of the profession and keep 
it alive and progressive.
In the 10 years since the publication of the 7th edition of Roark’s Formulas for Stress 
and Strain, we have witnessed significant advances in engineering methodology in 
solving stress analysis problems. This has motivated the authors to embark on an 
improved edition of this book.
To this end, in preparation of this 8th edition, the authors had three continuing 
objectives. Firstly, to modernize and update the contents as required. Secondly, to introduce 
new topics and chapters that will maintain the high standard of this book. Finally, to 
improve upon the material retained from the 7th edition. The 8th edition of Roark’s is 
intended to make available a compact, comprehensive summary of the formulas and 
principles pertaining to strength of materials for both practicing engineers and students.
This book is intended primarily to be a reference book that is authoritative and 
covers the field of stress analysis in a comprehensive manner. Similar to the 7th edition, 
the tabular format is continued in this edition. This format has been particularly 
successful when implementing problem solutions on user-friendly computer software 
such as MATLAB, MathCAD, TK Solver, and Excel. Commercial packages are available 
which integrate the above-mentioned software with Roark’s. Tabulated coefficients are in 
dimensionless form for convenience in using either system of units. Design formulas 
drawn from works published in the past remain in the system units originally published 
or quoted.
The authors are mindful of the competing requirements to offer the user a broad 
spectrum of information that has made this book so useful for over 70 years. Therefore, 
in this edition, the authors have included a number of new chapters and topics. The 
main organizational change in the 8th edition is that the three parts in the 7th edition 
have been eliminated and the chapters are arranged sequentially. Other changes/
additions included in the 8th edition are as follows:
•	 Chapter 1, Introduction: The conversion tables are expanded.
•	 Chapter 2, Stress and Strain: Important Relationships: The construction of 
Mohr’s circle and additional examples and tables are provided.

properties are included.
•	 Chapter 4, Principles and Analytical Methods: The energy method and 
Castigliano’s theorem with examples problems are added.

tables are added. 
•	 Chapter 16, Dynamic and Temperature Stresses: The fundamentals of vibration, 
vibration isolation, and tables for the natural frequencies of many beams and 
shapes are added.
•	 Chapter 17, Stress Concentration: The tables are expanded.
•	 Chapter 18, Fatigue and Fracture: This is a new chapter where the following 
new topics are presented: Fracture Mechanics, The Stress Intensity Factor, 
Fracture Toughness, Crack Tip Plasticity, and The J Integral. Also, tables of the 
stress intensity factors of many types of cracks and geometries are presented.
•	 Chapter 19, Stresses in Fasteners and Joints: This is a new chapter where new topics 
such as welding, welded joints, and riveted and bolted joints, and corresponding 
tables, are included.
•	 Chapter 20, Composite Materials: This is a new chapter dealing with the mechanics 
of composite materials. The following topics are presented: Macromechanics of a 
Lamina, Micromechanics of a Lamina, Failure Criterion for a Lamina, Classical 
Lamination Theory, Stress and Strain in a Laminate, and Strength and Failure 
Analyses of Laminates, along with tables of the mechanical properties of many 
composite materials.
•	 Chapter 21, Solid Biomechanics: Increased recognition of biomechanics and the 
application of solid mechanics in biological tissues have resulted in this new 
chapter on solid biomechanics. Here the anatomy, material characteristics, and 
biomechanics of several generic types of human tissues such as bone, muscles, 
ligaments, and tendons are presented. In addition, the biomechanics of joints 
such as knee, hip, cervical and lumbar spine, shoulder, and elbow are discussed. 
Human factors, types of prostheses, and tables of biomaterial properties are 
also presented. 
•	 Appendix A, Properties of a Plane Area: Several new tables are added.
•	 Appendix B, Mathematical Formulas and Matrices: This is a new appendix 
where the basic mathematic formulas needed in daily engineering practice are 
provided.
The authors would especially like to thank those individuals, publishers, institutions, 
and corporations who have generously given permission to use material in this and 
previous editions, and the many dedicated readers and users of Roark’s Formulas for 
Stress and Strain.

Preface to the First Edition 
T
his book was written for the purpose of making available a compact, adequate 
summary of the formulas, facts, and principles pertaining to strength of materials. 
It is intended primarily as a reference book and represents an attempt to meet 
what is believed to be a present need of the designing engineer. 
This need results from the necessity for more accurate methods of stress analysis 
imposed by the trend of engineering practice. That trend is toward greater speed and 
complexity of machinery, greater size and diversity of structures, and greater economy 
and refinement of design. In consequence of such developments, familiar problems, for 
which approximate solutions were formerly considered adequate, are now frequently 
found to require more precise treatment, and many less familiar problems, once of 
academic interest only, have become of great practical importance. The solutions and 
data desired are often to be found only in advanced treatises or scattered through an 
extensive literature, and the results are not always presented in such form as to be 
suited to the requirements of the engineer. To bring together as much of this material 
as is likely to prove generally useful and to present it in convenient form have been the 
author’s aim. 
The scope and management of the book are indicated by the contents. In Part 1 are 
defined all terms whose exact meanings might otherwise not be clear. In Part 2 certain 
useful general principles are stated; analytical and experimental methods of stress 
analysis are briefly described; and information concerning the behavior of material 
under stress is given. In Part 3 the behavior of structural elements under various 
conditions of loading is discussed, and extensive tables of formulas for the calculation 
of stress, strain, and strength are given. 
Because they are not believed to serve the purpose of this book, derivations of 
formulas and detailed explanations, such as are appropriate in a textbook, are omitted, 
but a sufficient number of examples are included to illustrate the application of the 
various formulas and methods. Numerous references to more detailed discussions are 
given, but for the most part these are limited to sources that are generally available, and 
no attempt has been made to compile an exhaustive bibliography. 
That such a book as this derives almost wholly from the work of others is self-
evident, and it is the author’s hope that due acknowledgment has been made of the 
immediate sources of all material presented here. To the publishers and others who 
have generously permitted the use of material, he wishes to express his thanks. The 
helpful criticisms and suggestions of his colleagues, Professors E. R. Maurer, M. O. 
Withey, J. B. Kommers, and K. F. Wendt, are gratefully acknowledged. A considerable

number of the tables of formulas have been published from time to time in Product 
Engineering, and the opportunity thus afforded for criticism and study of arrangement 
has been of great advantage. 
Finally, it should be said that, although every care has been taken to avoid errors, it 
would be oversanguine to hope that none had escaped detection; for any suggestions 
that readers may make concerning needed corrections, the author will be grateful.

Introduction
T
he widespread use of personal computers, which have the power to solve problems 
solvable in the past only on mainframe computers, has influenced the tabulated 
format of this book. Computer programs for structural analysis, employing tech-
niques such as the finite element method and the boundary element method, are also 
available for general use. These programs are very powerful; however, in many cases, 
elements of structural systems can be analyzed quite effectively independently without 
the need for an elaborate finite element model. In some instances, finite element models 
or programs are verified by comparing their solutions with the results given in a book 
such as this. Contained within this book are simple, accurate, and thorough tabulated 
formulations that can be applied to the stress analysis of a comprehensive range of 
structural components.
This chapter serves to introduce the reader to the terminology, state property units 
and conversions, and contents of the book.
1.1  Terminology
Definitions of terms used throughout the book can be found in the glossary in 
App. C.
1.2  State Properties, Units, and Conversions
The basic state properties associated with stress analysis include the following: geo-
metrical properties such as length, area, volume, centroid, center of gravity, and second-
area moment (area moment of inertia); material properties such as mass density, 
modulus of elasti­city, Poisson’s ratio, and thermal expansion coefficient; loading 
proper­ties such as force, moment, and force distributions (e.g., force per unit length, 
force per unit area, and force per unit volume); other properties associated with load-
ing, including energy, work, and power; and stress analysis properties such as defor-
mation, strain, and stress.
Two basic systems of units are employed in the field of stress analysis: SI units 
and USCU units.∗ SI units are mass-based units using the kilogram (kg), meter (m), 
second (s), and Kelvin (K) or degree Celsius (°C) as the fundamental units of mass, 
length, time, and temperature, respectively. Other SI units, such as that used for force, 
∗SI and USCU are abbreviations for the International System of Units (from the French Systéme 
International d’Unités) and the United States Customary Units, respectively.

Table 1.1  Units Appropriate to Structural Analysis*
the Newton (kg-m/s2), are derived quantities. USCU units are force-based units using 
the pound force (lbf), inch (in) or foot (ft), second (s), and degree Fahrenheit (°F) as the 
fundamental units of force, length, time, and temperature, respectively. Other USCU 
units, such as that used for mass, the slug (lbf-s2/ft) or the nameless lbf-s2/in, are derived 
quantities. Table 1.1 gives a listing of the primary SI and USCU units used for structural 
analysis. Other SI units are given in Table 1.2. Certain prefixes may be appropriate, 
depending on the size of the quantity. Common prefixes are given in Table 1.3. For exam-
ple, the modulus of elasticity of carbon steel is approximately 207 GPa = 207 × 109 Pa = 
207 × 109 N/m2. Pre­fixes are normally used with SI units. However, there are cases where 
prefixes are also used with USCU units. Some examples are the kpsi (1 kpsi = 103 psi = 
103 lbf/in2), kip (1 kip = 1 kilopound = 1000 lbf), and Mpsi (1 Mpsi = 106 psi).
Depending on the application, different units may be specified. It is important that 
the analyst be aware of all the implications of the units and make consistent use of them. 
For example, if you are building a model from a CAD file in which the design dimen-
sional units are given in mm, it is unnecessary to change the system of units or to scale

the model to units of m. However, if in this example the input forces are in Newtons, 
then the output stresses will be in N/mm2, which is correctly expressed as MPa. If 
in this example applied moments are to be specified, the units should be N-mm. For 
deflections in this example, the modulus of elasticity E should also be specified in MPa 
and the output deflections will be in mm.
Tables 1.4 and 1.5 present the conversions from USCU units to SI units and vice 
versa for some common state property units. The more detailed conversion units are 
given in Table 1.6.

Chapter 2
Stress and Strain:  
Important Relationships
U
nderstanding the physical properties of stress and strain is a prerequisite to 
utilizing the many methods and results of structural analysis in design. 
This chapter provides the definitions and important relationships of stress 
and strain.
2.1  Stress
Stress is simply a distributed force on an external or internal surface of a body. To obtain 
a physical feeling of this idea, consider being submerged in water at a particular depth. 
The “force” of the water one feels at this depth is a pressure, which is a compressive 
stress, and not a finite number of “concentrated” forces. Other types of force distribu-
tions (stress) can occur in a liquid or solid. Tensile (pulling rather than pushing) and 
shear (rubbing or sliding) force distributions can also exist.
Consider a general solid body loaded as shown in Fig. 2.1(a). Pi and pi are applied 
concentrated forces and applied surface force distributions, respectively; and Ri and ri 
are possible support reaction force and surface force distributions, respectively. To 
determine the state of stress at point Q in the body, it is necessary to expose a surface 
containing the point Q. This is done by making a planar slice, or break, through the 
body intersecting the point Q. The orientation of this slice is arbitrary, but it is generally 
made in a convenient plane where the state of stress can be determined easily or where 
certain geometric relations can be utilized. The first slice, illustrated in Fig. 2.1(b), is 
arbitrarily oriented by the surface normal x. This establishes the yz plane. The external 
forces on the remaining body are shown, as well as the internal force (stress) distribu-
tion across the exposed internal surface containing Q. In the general case, this distribu-
tion will not be uniform along the surface, and will be neither normal nor tangential to 
the surface at Q. However, the force distribution at Q will have components in the nor-
mal and tangential directions. These components will be tensile or compressive and 
shear stresses, respectively.
Following a right-handed rectangular coordinate system, the y and z axes are 
defined perpendicular to x, and tangential to the surface. Examine an infinitesimal area

 surrounding Q, as shown in Fig. 2.2(a). The equivalent concentrated force 
due to the force distribution across this area is ∆Fx, which in general is neither normal

and ∆Fxz, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2.2(b). Note that the first subscript denotes the 
direction normal to the surface and the second gives the actual direction of the force 
component. The average distributed force per unit area (average stress) in the x direc-
tion is*

Recalling that stress is actually a point function, we obtain the exact stress in the x 
direction at point Q by allowing ∆Ax to approach zero.

Stresses arise from the tangential forces ∆Fxy and ∆Fxz as well, and since these forces 
are tangential, the stresses are shear stresses. Similar to Eq. (2.1-1),

Since, by definition, σ represents a normal stress acting in the same direction as the 
corresponding surface normal, double subscripts are redundant, and standard prac-
tice is to drop one of the subscripts and write σxx as σx. The three stresses existing on 
the exposed surface at the point are illustrated together using a single arrow vector for 
each stress as shown in Fig. 2.3. However, it is important to realize that the stress arrow 
represents a force distribution (stress, force per unit area), and not a concentrated force. 
The shear stresses τxy and τxz are the components of the net shear stress acting on the 
surface, where the net shear stress is given by∗

To describe the complete state of stress at point Q completely, it would be necessary 
to examine other surfaces by making different planar slices. Since different planar slices 
would necessitate different coordinates and different free-body diagrams, the stresses 
on each planar surface would be, in general, quite different. As a matter of fact, in gen-
eral, an infinite variety of conditions of normal and shear stress exist at a given point 
within a stressed body. So, it would take an infinitesimal spherical surface surrounding 
the point Q to understand and describe the complete state of stress at the point. Fortu-
nately, through the use of the method of coordinate transformation, it is only necessary to 
know the state of stress on three different surfaces to describe the state of stress on any 
surface. This method is described in Sec. 2.3.
The three surfaces are generally selected to be mutually perpendicular, and are 
illustrated in Fig. 2.4 using the stress subscript notation as earlier defined. This state of 
stress can be written in matrix form, where the stress matrix [r] is given by

2.2  Strain and the Stress–Strain Relations
As with stresses, two types of strains exist: normal and shear strains, which are denoted 
by ε and γ, respectively. Normal strain is the rate of change of the length of the stressed 
element in a particular direction. Shear strain is a measure of the distortion of the

stressed element, and has two definitions: the engineering shear strain and the elasticity 
shear strain. Here, we will use the former, more popular, definition. However, a dis-
cussion of the relation of the two definitions will be provided in Sec. 2.4. The engi-
neering shear strain is defined as the change in the corner angle of the stress cube, in 
radians.
Normal Strain
Initially, consider only one normal stress σx applied to the element as shown in Fig. 2.6. 
We see that the element increases in length in the x direction and decreases in length in 
the y and z directions. The dimensionless rate of increase in length is defined as the 
normal strain, where ε
ε
x
y
,
, and εz represent the normal strains in the x, y, and z direc-
tions, respectively. Thus, the new length in any direction is equal to its original length 
plus the rate of increase (normal strain) times its original length. That is,

ped. In Fig. 2.7(b), the shear strain is defined as the change in the angle BAD. That is,
γ xy
BAD
B A D
= ∠

where γ xy is in dimensionless radians.
For a linear, homogeneous, isotropic material, the shear strains in the xy, yz, and zx 
planes are directly related to the shear stresses by

2.3  Stress Transformations
As was stated in Sec. 2.1, knowing the state of stress on three mutually orthogonal 
surfaces at a point in a structure is sufficient to generate the state of stress for any sur-
face at the point. This is accomplished through the use of coordinate transformations. 
The development of the transformation equations is quite lengthy and is not provided 
here (see Ref. 1). Consider the element shown in Fig. 2.8(a), where the stresses on sur-
faces with normals in the x, y, and z directions are known and are represented by the 
stress matrix

Now consider the element, shown in Fig. 2.8(b), to correspond to the state of stress at the 
same point but defined relative to a different set of surfaces with normals in the ′
′
x y
,
, 
and ′z  directions. The stress matrix corresponding to this element is given by

To determine [ ]

x y z  by coordinate transformation, we need to establish the rela-
tionship between the ′ ′ ′
x y z  and the xyz coordinate systems. This is normally done using

directional cosines. First, let us consider the relationship between the ′x  axis and the 
xyz coordinate system. The orientation of the ′x  axis can be established by the angles

The stress transformation by Eq. (2.3-8) can be implemented very easily using a computer 
spreadsheet or mathematical software. Defining the directional cosines is another matter. 
One method is to define the ′ ′ ′
x y z  coordinate system by a series of two-dimensional rota-
tions from the initial xyz coordinate system. Table 2.2 at the end of this chapter gives 
transformation matrices for this.

Determine the state of stress on an element that is oriented by first rotating the xyz axes 45° about the 
z axis, and then rotating the resulting axes 30° about the new x axis.

Stresses on a Single Surface
If one was concerned about the state of stress on one particular surface, a complete 
stress transformation would be unnecessary. Let the directional cosines for the normal 
of the surface be given by l, m, and n. It can be shown that the normal stress on the 
surface is given by

Solution  The normal to the surface is established by the directional numbers of the plane and are simply 
the coefficients of x, y, and z terms of the equation of the plane. Thus, the directional numbers are  
2, -1, and 3. The directional cosines of the normal to the surface are simply the normalized values 
of the directional numbers, which are the directional numbers divided by 2

If the state of stress is desired on a single surface with a normal rotated θ counterclock-
wise from the x axis, the first and third equations of Eqs. (2.3-16) can be used as given. 
However, using trigonometric identities, the equations can be written in slightly differ-
ent form. Letting s and t represent the desired normal and shear stresses on the surface, 
the equations are
(a) Initial element
(b) Transformed element

Principal Stresses

where the shear stresses are zero. These stresses, which are actually the eigenvalues of 
the stress matrix, are called the principal stresses. Three principal stresses exist,

To determine the directional cosines for a specific principal stress, the stress is sub-
stituted into Eqs. (2.3-18). The three resulting equations in the unknowns lp , mp , and np 
will not be independent since they were used to obtain the principal stress. Thus, only

two of Eqs. (2.3-18) can be used. However, the second-order Eq. (2.3-19) can be used as 
the third equation for the three directional cosines. Instead of solving one second-order 
and two linear equations simultaneously, a simplified method is demonstrated in the 
following example.∗

associated with the normals to the surfaces of each principal stress.

which is nonlinear in l1, m1, and n1. Rather than solving the three equations simultaneously, consider

If two of the principal stresses are equal, there will exist an infinite set of surfaces containing these 
principal stresses, where the normals of these surfaces are perpendicular to the direction of the third 
principal stress. If all three principal stresses are equal, a hydrostatic state of stress exists, and regardless 
of orientation, all surfaces contain the same principal stress with no shear stress.
Principal Stresses, Plane Stress
Considering the stress element shown in Fig. 2.11(a), the shear stresses on the surface with 
a normal in the z direction are zero. Thus, the normal stress σz = 0 is a principal stress. The 
directions of the remaining two principal stresses will be in the xy plane. If τ ′ ′ =

Maximum Shear Stresses
Consider that the principal stresses for a general stress state have been determined 
using the methods just described and are illustrated by Fig. 2.13. The 123 axes represent 
the normals for the principal surfaces with directional cosines determined by Eqs. (2.3-18) 
and (2.3-19). Viewing down a principal stress axis (e.g., the 3 axis) and performing a 
plane stress transformation in the plane normal to that axis (e.g., the 12 plane), one 
would find that the shear stress is a maximum on surfaces ±45° from the two principal 
stresses in that plane (
,
,
)
e.g. σ
σ
1
2 . On these surfaces, the maximum shear stress would 
be one-half the difference of the principal stresses [

2.4  Strain Transformations
The equations for strain transformations are identical to those for stress transforma-
tions. However, the engineering strains as defined in Sec. 2.2 will not transform. Trans-
formations can be performed if the shear strain is modified. All of the equations for the 
stress transformations can be employed simply by replacing σ and τ in the equations by 
ε and γ/2 (using the same subscripts), respectively. Thus, for example, the equations for 
plane stress, Eqs. (2.3-16), can be written for strain as

2.5  Mohr’s Circle
A graphical solution for plane stress and plane strain transformations is known as 
Mohr’s circle, where the principal stresses and maximum shear stresses as well as 
stresses in an arbitrary plane are determined. While the graphical solution is an old 
classical method, Mohr’s circle is still widely used by engineers all over the world.

Equation (2.5-3) is the equation of a circle where the abscissa is the normal stress and the 
ordinate is the shear stress, as shown in Fig. 2.15.
In Fig. 2.15 σmin and σmax are the minimum and maximum values of normal stress. 
tmin and tmax are the minimum and maximum values of shear stress.

of τxy at points A and B is positive for this element. Locate points A and B on the coor-
dinate system (σ, τ) as follows: For a positive shear at point A (i.e., CCW direction of 
the shear with respect to the center of the element) use downward τ. For a positive 
shear at point B (i.e., CW direction of the shear with respect to the center of the ele-
ment) use upward τ, as shown in Fig. 2.17. That is, the upper half of the vertical ordinate

is for positive τxy of point B and the lower half of the vertical ordinate is for positive 
τxy of point A.
Once the two points A and B are located, connect the two points and draw a circle 
that passes through points A and B with its center on the horizontal axis, (where the line 
AB intersect with the horizontal axis). This is the Mohr’s circle of the element. 
The intersections of the circle with the x axis are the maximum (σ1) and minimum 
(σ2) principal stresses only in the plane of analysis and the radius of the circle is the 
maximum shear stress, τmax. To find the orientation of the element in which the maxi-
mum stresses occur, the element must be rotated half of the angle between CA and the

To determine the normal and shear stresses in an arbitrary plane, for example θ 
degrees from the x axis, one can rotate the diameter AB the amount 2θ in the same direc-
tion as in the element. The new coordinates of A and B are the stress components on the 
new plane; see Fig. 2.18. The stresses in the new orientation can be determined from 
Mohr’s circle, as shown in Fig. 2.17.

Chapter 3
The Behavior of Bodies 
under Stress
T
his discussion pertains to the behavior of what are commonly designated as 
structural materials. That is, materials suitable for structures and members that 
must sustain loads without suffering damage. Included in this category are most 
of the metals, concrete, wood, composite materials, some plastics, etc. It is beyond the 
scope of this book to give more than a mere statement of a few important facts concern-
ing the behavior of a stressed material. Extensive literature is available on every phase 
of the subject, and the articles contained herein will serve as an introduction only.
3.1  Methods of Loading
The mechanical properties of a material are usually determined by laboratory tests, and 
the commonly accepted values of ultimate strength, elastic limit, etc., are those found 
by testing a specimen of a certain form in a certain manner. To apply results so obtained 
in engineering design requires an understanding of the effects of many different vari-
ables, such as form and scale, temperature and other conditions of service, and method 
of loading.
The method of loading, in particular, affects the behavior of bodies under stress. 
There are an infinite number of ways in which stress may be applied to a body, but for 
most purposes it is sufficient to distinguish the types of loading now to be defined.
	
1.	 Short-time static loading.  The load is applied so gradually that at any instant all 
parts are essentially in equilibrium. In testing, the load is increased progressively 
until failure occurs, and the total time required to produce failure is not more 
than a few minutes. In service, the load is increased progressively up to its 
maximum value, is maintained at that maximum value for only a limited time, 
and is not reapplied often enough to make fatigue a consid­eration. The ultimate 
strength, elastic limit, yield point, yield strength, and modulus of elasticity of a 
material are usually determined by short-time static testing at room temperature.
	
2.	 Long-time static loading.  The maximum load is applied gradually and main­
tained. In testing, it is maintained for a sufficient time to enable its probable final 
effect to be predicted; in service, it is maintained continuously or intermittently 
during the life of the structure. The creep, or flow characteristics, of a material 
and its probable permanent strength are determined by long-time static testing at 
the temperatures prevailing under service conditions. (See Sec. 3.6.)

46	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
	
3.	 Repeated loading.  Typically, a load or stress is applied and wholly or partially 
removed or reversed repeatedly. This type of loading is important if high 
stresses are repeated for a few cycles or if relatively lower stresses are repeated 
many times; it is discussed under Fatigue. (See Sec. 3.8.)
	
4.	 Dynamic loading.  The circumstances are such that the rate of change of 
momentum of the parts must be taken into account. One such condition may be 
that the parts are given definite accelera­tions corresponding to a controlled 
motion, such as the constant acceleration of a part of a rotating member or the 
repeated accel­erations suffered by a portion of a connecting rod. As far as stress 
effects are concerned, these loadings are treated as virtually static and the inertia 
forces (Sec. 16.2) are treated exactly as though they were ordinary static loads.
A second type of quasi-static loading, quick static loading, can be typified by the rapid 
burning of a powder charge in a gun barrel. Neither the powder, gas, nor any part of the 
barrel acquires appreci­able radial momentum; therefore, equilibrium may be considered 
to exist at any instant and the maximum stress produced in the gun barrel is the same as 
though the powder pressure had developed gradually.
In static loading and the two types of dynamic loading just described, the loaded 
member is required to resist a definite force. It is important to distinguish this from 
impact loading, where the loaded member is usually required to absorb a definite amount 
of energy.
Impact loading can be divided into two general categories. In the first case a rela-
tively large slow-moving mass strikes a less massive beam or bar and the kinetic energy 
of the moving mass is assumed to be converted into strain energy in the beam. All por-
tions of the beam and the moving mass are assumed to stop moving simultaneously. 
The shape of the elastic axis of the deflected beam or bar is thus the same as in static 
loading. A special case of this loading, generally called sudden loading, occurs when a 
mass that is not moving is released when in contact with a beam and falls through the 
distance the beam deflects. This produces approximately twice the stress and deflection 
that would have been produced had the mass been “eased” onto the beam (see Sec. 16.4). 
The second case of impact loading involves the mass of the member being struck. Stress 
waves travel through the member during the impact and continue even after the impact-
ing mass has rebounded (see Sec. 16.3).
On consideration, it is obvious that methods of loading really differ only in degree. 
As the time required for the load to be applied increases, short-time static loading 
changes imperceptibly into long­time static loading; impact may be produced by a body 
moving so slowly that the resulting stress conditions are practically the same as though 
equal deflection had been produced by static loading; the number of stress repetitions 
at which fatigue becomes involved is not altogether definite. Furthermore, all these 
methods of loading may be combined or superimposed in various ways. Nonetheless, 
the classification presented is convenient because most structural and machine parts 
function under loading that may be classified definitely as one of the types described.
3.2  Elasticity; Proportionality of Stress and Strain
In determining stress by mathematical analysis, it is customary to assume that material 
is elastic, isotropic, homogeneous, and infinitely divisible without change in properties 
and that it conforms to Hooke’s law, which states that strain is proportional to stress. 

T h e  B e h a v i o r  o f  B o d i e s  u n d e r  S t r e s s 	
47
Actually, none of these assumptions is strictly true. A structural material is usually an 
aggregate of crystals, fibers, or cemented particles, the arrangement of which may be 
either random or systematic. When the arrangement is random, the material is essen-
tially isotropic if the part considered is large in comparison with the constituent units; 
when the arrangement is systematic, the elastic properties and strength are usually dif-
ferent in different directions and the material is anisotropic. Again, when subdivision is 
carried to the point where the part under consideration comprises only a portion of a 
single crystal, fiber, or other unit, in all probability its properties will differ from those 
of a larger part that is an aggregate of such units. Finally, very careful experiments show 
that for all materials there is probably some set and some deviation from Hooke’s law 
for any stress, however small.
These facts impose certain limitations upon the conventional meth­ods of stress 
analysis and must often be taken into account, but formulas for stress and strain, math-
ematically derived and based on the assumptions stated, give satisfactory results for 
nearly all problems of engineering design. In particular, Hooke’s law may be regarded 
as practically true up to a proportional limit, which, though often not sharply defined, 
can be established for most materials with sufficient definiteness. So, too, a fairly defi-
nite elastic limit is determinable; in most cases it is so nearly equal to the proportional 
limit that no distinction need be made between the two.
3.3  Factors Affecting Elastic Properties
For ordinary purposes it may be assumed that the elastic properties of most metals, 
when stressed below a nominal proportional limit, are constant with respect to stress, 
unaffected by ordinary atmospheric variations of temperature, unaffected by prior 
applications of moder­ate stress, and independent of the rate of loading. When precise 
relations between stress and strain are important, as in the design or calibration of 
instruments, these assumptions cannot always be made. The fourth edition of this book 
(Ref. 1) discussed in detail the effects of strain rate, temperature, etc., on the elastic 
properties of many metals and gave references for the experiments performed. The 
relationships between atomic and molecular structure and the elastic properties are 
discussed in texts on materials science.
Wood exhibits a higher modulus of elasticity and much higher proportional limit 
when tested rapidly than when tested slowly. The standard impact test on a beam indi-
cates a fiber stress at the propor­tional limit approximately twice as great as that found 
by the standard static bending test. Absorption of moisture up to the fiber saturation 
point greatly lowers both the modulus of elasticity and the propor­tional limit (Ref. 2).
Both concrete and cast iron have stress-strain curves more or less curved through-
out, and neither has a definite proportional limit. For these materials, it is customary to 
define E as the ratio of some definite stress (for example, the allowable stress or one-
fourth the ultimate strength) to the corresponding unit strain; the quantity so deter-
mined is called the secant modulus since it represents the slope of the secant of the 
stress-strain diagram drawn from the origin to the point representing the stress chosen. 
The moduli of elasticity of cast iron are much more variable than those of steel, and the 
stronger grades are stiffer than the weaker ones. Cast iron suffers a distinct set from 
the first application of even a moderate stress; but after several repetitions of that stress, 
the material exhibits perfect elasticity up to, but not beyond, that stress. The modulus 
of elasticity is slightly less in tension than in compression.

48	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
Concrete also shows considerable variation in modulus of elasticity, and in general 
its stiffness increases with its strength. Like cast iron, concrete can be made to exhibit 
perfect elasticity up to a moderate stress by repeated loading up to that stress. Because 
of its tendency to yield under continuous loading, the modulus of elasticity indicated 
by long-time loading is much less than that obtained by progressive load­ing at ordinary 
speeds.
3.4  Load Deformation Relation for a Body
If Hooke’s law holds for the material of which a member or structure is composed, the 
member or structure will usually conform to a similar law of load-deformation propor-
tionality and the deflection of a beam or truss, the twisting of a shaft, the dilation of a 
pressure container, etc., may in most instances be assumed proportional to the magni-
tude of the applied load or loads.
There are two important exceptions to this rule. One is to be found in any case 
where the stresses due to the loading are appreciably affected by the deformation. 
Examples of this are a beam subjected to axial and transverse loads; a flexible wire or 
cable held at the ends and loaded transversely; a thin diaphragm held at the edges and 
loaded normal to its plane; a ball pressed against a plate or against another ball; and a 
helical spring under severe extension.
The second exception is represented by any case in which failure occurs through 
elastic instability, as in the compressive loading of a long, slender column. Here, for 
compression loads less than a specific critical (Euler) load, elastic instability plays no 
part and the axial deformation is linear with load. At the critical load, the type of defor-
mation changes, and the column bends instead of merely short­ening axially. For any 
load beyond the critical load, high bending stresses and failure occurs through exces-
sive deflection (see Sec. 3.13).
3.5  Plasticity
Elastic deformation represents an actual change in the distance between atoms or mol-
ecules; plastic deformation represents a perma­nent change in their relative positions. In 
crystalline materials, this permanent rearrangement consists largely of group displace-
ments of the atoms in the crystal lattice brought about by slip on planes of least resis-
tance, parts of a crystal sliding past one another and in some instances suffering angular 
displacement. In amorphous materials, the rearrangement appears to take place through 
the individual shifting from positions of equilibrium of many atoms or molecules, the 
cause being thermal agitation due to external work and the result appearing as a more 
or less uniform flow like that of a viscous liquid. It should be noted that plastic defor-
mation before rupture is much less for biaxial or triaxial tension than for one-way stress; 
for this reason metals that are ordinarily ductile may prove brittle when thus stressed.
3.6  Creep and Rupture under Long-Time Loading
More materials will creep or flow to some extent and eventually fail under a sustained 
stress less than the short-time ultimate strength. After a short time at load, the initial 
creep related to stress redis­tribution in the structure and strain hardening ceases and 
the steady state, or viscous creep, predominates. The viscous creep will continue until 

T h e  B e h a v i o r  o f  B o d i e s  u n d e r  S t r e s s 	
49
fracture unless the load is reduced sufficiently, but it is seldom important in materials 
at temperatures less than 40 to 50% of their absolute melting temperatures. Thus, creep 
and long-time strength at atmospheric temperatures must sometimes be taken into 
account in designing members of nonferrous metals and in selecting allowable stresses 
for wood, plastics, and concrete.
Metals
Creep is an important consideration in high-pressure steam and distillation equipment, 
gas turbines, nuclear reactors, supersonic vehicles, etc. Marin, Odqvist, and Finnie, in 
Ref. 3, give excellent surveys and list references on creep in metals and structures. Con-
way (Refs. 4 and 5) discusses the effectiveness of various parametric equations, and 
Conway and Flagella (Ref. 6) present extensive creep-rupture data for the refractory 
metals. Odqvist (Ref. 7) discusses the theory of creep and its application to large defor-
mation and stability problems in plates, shells, membranes, and beams and tabulates 
creep constants for 15 common metals and alloys. Hult (Ref. 8) also discusses creep 
theory and its application to many structural problems. Penny and Marriott (Ref. 9) 
discuss creep theories and the design of experiments to verify them. They also discuss 
the development of several metals for increased resistance to creep at high tempera-
tures as well as polymeric and composite materials at lower temperatures. Reference 10 
is a series of papers with extensive references covering creep theory, material proper-
ties, and structural problems.
Plastics
The literature on the behavior of the many plastics being used for structural or machine 
applications is too extensive to list here.
Concrete
Under sustained compressive stress, concrete suffers considerable plastic deformation 
and may flow for a very long time at stresses less than the ordinary working stress. 
Continuous flow has been observed over a period of 10 years, though ordinarily it 
ceases or becomes imperceptible within 1 or 2 years. The rate of flow is greater for air 
than for water storage, greater for small than for large speci­mens, and for moderate 
stresses increases approximately as the applied stress. On removal of stress, some elas-
tic recovery occurs. Concrete also shows creep under tensile stress, the early creep rate 
being greater than the flow rate under compression (Refs. 11 and 16).
Under very gradually applied loading concrete exhibits an ultimate strength con-
siderably less than that found under short-time loading; in certain compression tests it 
was found that increasing the time of testing from 1 s to 4 h decreased the unit stress at 
failure about 30%, most of this decrease occurring between the extremely quick (1 or 2 s) 
and the conventional (several minutes) testing. This indicates that the compressive 
stress that concrete can sustain indefinitely may be considerably less than the ultimate 
strength as determined by a conventional test. On the other hand, the long-time imposi-
tion of a moderate loading appears to have no harmful effect; certain tests show that 
after 10 years of constant loading equal to one-fourth the ultimate strength, the com-
pressive strength of concrete cylinders is practically the same and the modulus of elas-
ticity is considerably greater than for similar cylinders that were not kept under load 
(Ref. 15).

50	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
The modulus of rupture of plain concrete also decreases with the time of loading, 
and some tests indicate that the long-time strength in cross-breaking may be only 55 to 
75% of the short-time strength (Ref. 12).
Reference 17 is a compilation of 12 papers, each with extensive references, dealing 
with the effect of volumetric changes on concrete structures. Design modifications to 
accommodate these volumetric changes are the main thrust of the papers.
Wood
Wood also yields under sustained stress; the long-time (several years) strength is about 
55% of the short-time (several minutes) strength in bending; for direct compression 
parallel to the grain the corresponding ratio is about 75% (Ref. 2).
3.7  Criteria of Elastic Failure and of Rupture
For the purpose of this discussion it is convenient to divide metals into two classes:  
(1) ductile metals, in which marked plastic deformation commences at a fairly definite 
stress (yield point, yield strength, or possibly elastic limit) and which exhibit consider-
able ultimate elonga­tion; and (2) brittle metals, for which the beginning of plastic 
deforma­tion is not clearly defined and which exhibit little ultimate elongation. Mild steel 
is typical of the first class, and cast iron is typical of the second; an ultimate elongation of 
5% has been suggested as the arbitrary dividing line between the two classes of metals.
A ductile metal is usually considered to have failed when it has suffered elastic 
failure, i.e., when marked plastic deformation has begun. Under simple uniaxial tension 
this occurs when the stress reaches a value we will denote by sys  , which represents the 
yield strength, yield point, or elastic limit, according to which one of these is the most 
satisfactory indication of elastic failure for the material in question. The question arises: 
when does elastic failure occur under other conditions of stress, such as compression, 
shear, or a combina­tion of tension, compression, and shear?
There are many theories of elastic failure that can be postulated for which the con-
sequences can be seen in the tensile test. When the tensile specimen begins to yield at a 
tensile stress of sys  , the following events occur:
	
1.	 The maximum-principal-stress theory.  The maximum principal stress reaches 
the tensile yield strength, sys.
	
2.	 The maximum-shear-stress theory (also called the Tresca theory).  The maximum 
shear stress reaches the shear yield strength, 0.5 sys.
	
3.	 The maximum-principal-strain theory.  The maximum principal strain reaches 
the yield strain, sys/E.
	
4.	 The maximum-strain-energy theory.  The strain energy per unit volume reaches 
a maximum of 0 5

(octahedral) surfaces containing a hydro­static normal stress, save = (s1 + s2 + s3)/3, 
reaches a value of 2

conditions as that provided by the maximum-distortion-energy theory.

Of these six theories, for ductile materials, the fifth and sixth are the ones that agree 
best with experimental evidence. However, the second leads to results so nearly the 
same and is simpler and more conserva­tive for design applications. Thus, it is more 
widely used as a basis for design.
Failure theories for yield of ductile materials are based on shear or distortion. The 
maximum-distortion-energy theory equates the distortion energy for a general case of 
stress to the distortion energy when a simple tensile specimen yields. In terms of the prin-
ciple stresses the distortion energy for the general case can be shown to be (see Ref. 59)

For yield under a single, uniaxial state of stress, the stress would be equated to sys. 
Thus, for yield, a single, uniaxial stress equivalent to the general state of stress is equated 
to the left-hand side of Eq. (3.7-3). This equivalent stress is called the von Mises stress, 
svM , and is given by

Therefore, the maximum-distortion-energy theory predicts elastic failure when the von 
Mises stress reaches the yield strength.
The maximum-octahedral-shear-stress theory yields identical results to that of the 
maximum-distortion-energy theory (see Ref. 59). Through stress transformation, a 
stress element can be isolated in which all normal stresses on it are equal. These normal 
stresses are the averages of the normal stresses of the stress matrix, which are also the 
averages of the principal stresses and are given by

Equating Eqs. (3.7-6) and (3.7-7) results in Eq. (3.7-3) again, proving that the maximum-

The maximum-shear-stress theory equates the maximum shear stress for a general 
state of stress to the maximum shear stress obtained when the tensile specimen yields.

This yields only two of the three principal stresses. The third principal stress for plane stress is zero. 
Once the three principal stresses are determined, they can be ordered according to s1 ≥ s2 ≥ s3 and then 
Eq. (3.7-8) can be employed.

is so small or so located as to have only negligible influence on the form and strength 
of the member as a whole. Whether or not such local overstressing is significant 
depends upon the properties of the material and the conditions of service. Fatigue 
properties, resistance to impact, and mechanical functioning are much more likely to 
be affected than static strength, and a degree of local overstressing that would consti-
tute failure in a high-speed machine part might be of no consequence whatever in a 
bridge member.
A brittle material cannot be considered to have definitely failed until it has broken, 
which can occur either through a tensile fracture, when the maximum tensile stress 
reaches the ultimate strength, or through what appears to be a shear fracture, when the 
maximum compressive stress reaches a certain value. The fracture occurs on a plane 
oblique to the maximum compressive stress but not, as a rule, on the plane of maximum 
shear stress, and so it cannot be considered to be purely a shear failure (see Ref. 14). The 
results of some tests on glass and Bakelite (Ref. 26) indicate that for these brittle materi-
als either the maximum stress or the maximum strain theory affords a satisfactory cri-
terion of rupture while neither the maximum shear stress nor the constant energy of 
distortion theory does. These tests also indicate that strength increases with rate of 
stress application and that the increase is more marked when the location of the most 
stressed zone changes during the loading (pressure of a sphere on a flat surface) than 
when this zone is fixed (axial tension).
Another failure theory that is applicable to brittle materials is the Coulomb-Mohr 
theory of failure. Brittle materials have ultimate compressive strengths suc greater than 
their ultimate tensile strengths sut  , and therefore both a uniaxial tensile test and a uni-
axial compressive test must be run to use the Coulomb–Mohr theory. First we draw on 
a single plot both Mohr’s stress circle for the tensile test at the instant of failure and 
Mohr’s stress circle for the compressive test at the instant of failure; then we complete a 
failure envelope simply by drawing a pair of tangent lines to the two circles, as shown 
in Fig. 3.2.
Failure under a complex stress situation is expected if the largest of the three Mohr 
circles for the given situation touches or extends outside the envelope just described.  
If all normal stresses are tensile, the results coincide with the maximum stress theory. 
Figure 3.2 

54	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
For a condition where the three principal stresses are sA , sB , and sC  , as shown in Fig. 3.2, 
failure is being approached but will not take place unless the dashed circle passing 
through sA and sC reaches the failure envelope.
The accurate prediction of the breaking strength of a member composed of brittle 
metal requires a knowledge of the effect of form and scale, and these effects are expressed 
by the rupture factor (see Sec. 3.11). In addition, what has been said here concerning 
brittle metals applies also to any essentially isotropic brittle material.
Thus far, our discussion of failure has been limited to isotropic materials. For wood, 
which is distinctly anisotropic, the possibility of failure in each of several ways and direc-
tions must be taken into account, viz.: (1) by tension parallel to the grain, which causes 
fracture; (2) by tension transverse to the grain, which causes fracture; (3) by shear paral-
lel to the grain, which causes fracture; (4) by compression parallel to the grain, which 
causes gradual buckling of the fibers usually accompanied by a shear displacement on 
an oblique plane; and (5) by compression transverse to the grain, which causes suffi-
cient deformation to make the part unfit for service. The unit stress producing each of 
these types of failure must be ascertained by suitable tests (Ref. 2).
Another anisotropic class of material of consequence is that of the composites. It is 
well-known that composite members (see Secs. 7.3, 8.2, and definitions), such as steel 
reinforced concrete beams, more effectively utilize the more expensive, higher-strength 
materials in high-stress areas and the less expensive, lower-strength materials in the 
low-stress areas. Composite materials accomplish the same effect at microstructural 
and macrostructural levels. Composite materials come in many forms, but are generally 
formulated by embedding a reinforcement material in the form of fibers, flakes, 
particles, or laminations, in a randomly or orderly oriented fashion within a base matrix 
of polymeric, metallic, or ceramic material. For more detail properties of composites, 
see Ref. 60.
3.8  Fatigue*
Practically all materials will break under numerous repetitions of a stress that is not as 
great as the stress required to produce immediate rupture. This phenomenon is known 
as fatigue.
Over the past 100 years, the effects of surface condition, corrosion, temperature, 
etc., on fatigue properties have been well-documented, but only in recent years has the 
microscopic cause of fatigue damage been attributed to cyclic plastic flow in the mate-
rial at the source of a fatigue crack (crack initiation) or at the tip of an existing fatigue 
crack (crack propagation; Ref. 20). The development of extremely sensitive extensome-
ters has permitted the separation of elastic and plastic strains when testing axially 
loaded specimens over short gage lengths. With this instrumentation it is possible to 
determine whether cyclic loading is accompanied by significant cyclic plastic strain 
and, if it is, whether the cyclic plastic strain continues at the same level, increases, or 
decreases. Sandor (Ref. 44) discusses this instrumentation and its use in detail.
It is not feasible to reproduce here even a small portion of the fatigue data available 
for various engineering materials. The reader should consult materials handbooks, 
manufacturers’ literature, design manuals, and texts on fatigue. See Refs. 44–48. Some

of the more important factors governing fatigue behavior in general will be outlined in 
the following material:
Number of Cycles to Failure
Most data concerning the number of cycles to failure are presented in the form of an 
S–N curve where the cyclic stress amplitude is plotted versus the number of cycles to 
failure. This generally leads to a straight-line log-log plot if we account for the scatter in 
the data. For ferrous metals a lower limit exists on the stress amplitude and is called the 
fatigue limit, or endurance limit. This generally occurs at a life of from 105–107 cycles of 
reversed stress, and we assume that stresses below this limit will not cause failure 
regardless of the number of repetitions. With the ability to separate elastic and plastic 
strains accurately, there are instances when a plot of plastic-strain amplitudes versus N 
and elastic-strain amplitudes versus N will reveal more useful information (Refs. 44 
and 45).
Method of Loading and Size of Specimen
Uniaxial stress can be produced by axial load, bending, or a combination of both. In flat-
plate bending, only the upper and lower surfaces are subjected to the full range of cyclic 
stress. In rotating bending, all surface layers are similarly stressed, but in axial loading, 
the entire cross section is subjected to the same average stress. Since fatigue properties 
of a material depend upon the statistical distribution of defects throughout the speci-
men, it is apparent that the three methods of loading will produce different results.
In a similar way, the size of a bending specimen will affect the fatigue behavior 
while it will have little effect on an axially loaded specimen. Several empirical formulas 
have been proposed to represent the influence of size on a machine part or test speci-
men in bending. For steel, Moore (Ref. 38) suggests the equation

where s′e is the endurance limit for a specimen of diameter d′ and ′′
se  is the endurance 
limit for a specimen of diameter d″. This formula was based on test results obtained 
with specimens from 0.125–1.875 inches in diameter and shows good agreement within 
that size range. Obviously it cannot be used for predicting the endurance limit of very 
small specimens. The few relevant test results available indicate a considerable decrease 
in endurance limit for very large diameters (Refs. 22–24).
Stress Concentrations
Fatigue failures occur at stress levels less than those necessary to produce the gross 
yielding which would blunt the sharp rise in stress at a stress concentration. It is neces-
sary, therefore, to apply the fatigue strengths of a smooth specimen to the peak stresses 
expected at the stress concentrations unless the size of the stress-concentrating notch or 
fillet approaches the grain size or the size of an anticipated defect in the material itself 
(see Factor of stress concentration in fatigue in Sec. 3.10). References 40 and 41 discuss the 
effect of notches on low-cycle fatigue. Table 17.1 provides stress concentration factor for 
many load and geometric conditions.

56	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
Surface Conditions
Surface roughness constitutes a form of stress raiser. Discussion of the effect of surface 
coatings and platings is beyond the scope of this book (see Refs. 28 and 36).
Corrosion Fatigue
Under the simultaneous action of corrosion and repeated stress, the fatigue strength of 
most metals is drastically reduced, sometimes to a small fraction of the strength in air, 
and a true endurance limit can no longer be said to exist. Liquids and gases not ordi-
narily thought of as especially conducive to corrosion will often have a very deleteri-
ous effect on fatigue properties, and resistance to corrosion is more important than 
normal fatigue strength in determin­ing the relative rating of different metals (Refs. 24, 
25, and 31).
Range of Stress 
Stressing a ductile material beyond the elastic limit or yield point in tension will raise 
the elastic limit for subsequent cycles but lower the elastic limit for compression. The 
consequence of this Bauschinger effect on fatigue is apparent if one accepts the state-
ment that fatigue damage is a result of cyclic plastic flow; i.e., if the range of cyclic stress 
is reduced sufficiently, higher peak stresses can be accepted without suffering continu-
ing damage.
Various empirical formulas for the endurance limit corresponding to any given 
range of stress variation have been suggested, the most generally accepted of which is 
expressed by the Goodman diagram or some modification thereof. Figure 3.3 shows one 
method of constructing this diagram. In each cycle, the stress varies from a maximum 
value smax to a minimum value smin  , either of which is plus or minus according to 
whether it is tensile or compressive. The mean stress is

the addition and subtraction being algebraic. With reference to rectan­gular axes, sm is 
measured horizontally and sa vertically. Obviously when sm = 0, the limiting value of sa 
is the endurance limit for fully reversed stress, denoted here by se. When sa = 0, the 
limiting value of sm is the ultimate tensile strength, denoted here by su. Points A and B 
on the axes are thus located.
According to the Goodman theory, the ordinate to a point on the straight line AB 
represents the maximum alternating stress sa that can be imposed in conjunction with 
the corresponding mean stress sm. Any point above AB represents a stress condition 
that would even­tually cause failure; any point below AB represents a stress condition 
with more or less margin of safety. A more conservative construction, suggested by 
Soderberg (Ref. 13), is to move point B back to sys  , the yield strength. A less conserva-
tive but sometimes preferred construction, proposed by Gerber, is to replace the straight 
line by the parabola.
The Goodman diagrams described can be used for steel and for aluminum and 
titanium alloys, but for cast iron many test results fall below the straight line AB and the 
lower curved line, suggested by Smith (Ref. 21), is preferred. Test results for magnesium 
alloys also sometimes fall below the straight line.
Figure 3.3 represents conditions where sm is tensile. If sm is compressive, sa is 
increased; and for values of sm less than the compression yield strength, the relation-
ship is represented approxi­mately by the straight line AB extended to the left with the 
same slope. When the mean stress and alternating stress are both torsional, sa is prac-
tically constant until sm exceeds the yield strength in shear; and for alternating bend-
ing combined with mean torsion, the same thing is true. But when sm is tensile and sa 
is torsional, sa diminishes as sm increases in almost the manner represented by the 
Goodman line. When stress concentration is to be taken into account, the accepted 
practice is to apply Kf (or Kt if Kf is not known) to sa only, not to sm (for Kt and Kf , see 
Sec. 3.10).
Residual Stress 
Since residual stresses, whether deliberately intro­duced or merely left over from manu-
facturing processes, will influence the mean stress, their effects can be accounted for. 
One should be careful, however, not to expect the beneficial effects of a residual stress 
if during the expected life of a structure it will encounter overloads sufficient to change 
the residual-stress distribution. Sandor (Ref. 44) discusses this in detail and points out 
that an occasional overload might be beneficial in some cases.
The several modified forms of the Goodman diagram are used for predicting the 
stress levels which will form cracks, but other more extensive plots such as the Haigh 
diagram (Ref. 45) can be used to predict in addition the stress levels for which cracks, 
once formed, will travel, fatigue lives, etc.
Combined Stress
No single theory of failure in Sec. 3.7 can be applied to all fatigue loading conditions. 
The maximum-distortion-energy theory seems to be conservative in most cases, however. 
Reference 18 gives a detailed description of an acceptable procedure for designing for 
fatigue under conditions of combined stress. The procedure described also considers 
the effect of mean stress on the cyclic stress range. Three criteria for failure are dis-
cussed: gross yielding, crack initiation, and crack propagation. An extensive discus­sion of 
fatigue under combined stress is found in Refs. 27, 31, and 45.

C h a p t e r  T h r e e
Stress History 
A very important question and one that has been given much attention is the influence 
of previous stressing on fatigue strength. One theory that has had considerable accep-
tance is the linear damage law (Miner in Ref. 27); here the assumption is made that the 
damage produced by repeated stressing at any level is directly proportional to the num-
ber of cycles. Thus, if the number of cycles producing failure (100% damage) at a stress 
range s1 is N1  , then the proportional damage produced by N cycles of the stress is N/N1 
and stressing at various stress levels for various numbers of cycles causes cumulative 
damage equal to the summation of such fractional values. Failure occurs, therefore, 
when SN/N1 = 1. The formula implies that the effect of a given number of cycles is the 
same, whether they are applied continuously or intermittently, and does not take into 
account the fact that for some metals understressing (stressing below the endurance 
limit) raises the endurance limit. The linear damage law is not reliable for all stress con-
ditions, and various modifications have been proposed, such as replacing 1 in the for-
mula by a quantity x whose numerical value, either more or less than unity, must be 
determined experimentally. Attempts have been made to develop a better theory (e.g., 
Corten and Dolan, Freudenthal and Gumbel, in Ref. 32). Though all the several theories 
are of value when used knowledgeably, it does not appear that as yet any generally reli-
able method is available for predicting the life of a stressed part under variable or ran-
dom loading. (See Refs. 19 and 39.) See Refs. 44 and 45 for a more detailed discussion.
A modification of the foil strain gage called an S–N fatigue life gage (Refs. 33 and 34) 
measures accumulated plastic deformation in the form of a permanent change in resis-
tance. A given total change in resistance can be correlated with the damage necessary to 
cause a fatigue failure in a given material.
3.9  Brittle Fracture
Brittle fracture is a term applied to an unexpected brittle failure of a material such as 
low-carbon steel where large plastic strains are usually noted before actual separation 
of the part. Major studies of brittle fracture started when failures such as those of welded 
ships operating in cold seas led to a search for the effect of temperature on the mode of 
failure. For a brittle fracture to take place, the material must be subjected to a tensile 
stress at a location where a crack or other very sharp notch or defect is present and the 
temperature must be lower than the so-called transition temperature. To determine a 
transition temperature for a given material, a series of notched speci­mens is tested 
under impact loading, each at a different temperature, and the ductility or the energy 
required to cause fracture is noted. There will be a limited range of temperatures over 
which the ductility or fracture energy will drop significantly. Careful examination of the 
fractured specimens will show that the material at the root of the notch has tried to 
contract laterally. Where the fracture energy is large, there is evidence of a large lateral 
contraction; and where the fracture energy is small, the lateral contraction is essentially 
zero. In all cases the lateral contraction is resisted by the adjacent less stressed material. 
The deeper and sharper cracks have relatively more material to resist lateral contrac-
tion. Thicker specimens have a greater distance over which to build up the necessary 
triaxial tensile stresses that lead to a tensile failure without producing enough shear 
stress to cause yielding. Thus, the term transition temperature is somewhat relative 
since it depends upon notch geometry as well as specimen size and shape. Since yield-
ing is a flow phenomenon, it is apparent that rate of loading is also important. Static

loading of sufficient intensity may start a brittle fracture, but it can continue under 
much lower stress levels owing to the higher rate of loading.
The ensuing research in the field of fracture mechanics has led to the development 
of both acceptable theories and experimental techniques, the discussion of which is 
beyond the scope of this book. Users should examine Refs. 49–58 for information and 
for extensive bibliographies.
3.10  Stress Concentration
The distribution of elastic stress across the section of a member may be nominally 
uniform or may vary in some regular manner, as illustrated by the linear distribution 
of stress in flexure. When the variation is abrupt so that within a very short distance 
the intensity of stress increases greatly, the condition is described as stress concentra-
tion. It is usually due to local irregularities of form such as small holes, screw threads, 
scratches, and similar stress raisers. There is obviously no hard and fast line of demar-
cation between the rapid variation of stress brought about by a stress raiser and the 
variation that occurs in such members as sharply curved beams, but in general the 
term stress concentration implies some form of irregularity not inherent in the member 
as such but accidental (tool marks) or introduced for some special purpose (screw 
thread).
The maximum intensity of elastic stress produced by many of the common kinds of 
stress raisers can be ascertained by mathematical analysis, photoelastic analysis, or 
direct strain measurement and is usually expressed by the stress concentration factor. 
This term is defined in App. C, but its meaning may be made clearer by an example. 
Consider a straight rectangular beam, originally of uniform breadth b and depth D, 
which has had cut across the lower face a fairly sharp transverse V-notch of uniform 
depth h, making the net depth of the beam section at that point D - h. If now the beam 
is subjected to a uniform bending moment M, the nominal fiber stress at the root of the 
notch may be calculated by ordinary flexure formula s = Mc/I, which here reduces to 
s = 6M/[b(D - h)2]. But the actual stress s′ is very much greater than this because of the 
stress concentration that occurs at the root of the notch. The ratio s′/s, actual stress 
divided by nominal stress, is the stress concentration factor Kt for this particular case. 
Values of Kt for a number of common stress raisers are given in Table 17.1. The most 
complete single source for numerical values of stress concentration factors is Peterson 
(Ref. 42). It also contains an extensive bibliography.
The abrupt variation and high local intensity of stress produced by stress raisers are 
characteristics of elastic behavior. The plastic yield­ing that occurs on overstressing greatly 
mitigates stress concentration even in relatively brittle materials and causes it to have 
much less influence on breaking strength than might be expected from a consid­eration 
of the elastic stresses only. The practical significance of stress concentration therefore 
depends on circumstances. For ductile metal under static loading it is usually (though 
not always) of little or no importance; for example, the high stresses that occur at the 
edges of rivet holes in structural steel members are safely ignored, the stress due to a 
tensile load being assumed uniform on the net section. (In the case of eyebars and simi-
lar pin-connected members, however, a reduc­tion of 25% in allowable stress on the net 
section is recommended.) For brittle material under static loading, stress concentration 
is often a serious consideration, but its effect varies widely and cannot be predicted 
either from Kt or from the brittleness of the material (see Ref. 35).

60	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
What may be termed the stress concentration factor at rupture, or the strength reduction 
factor, represents the significance of stress concentration for static loading. This factor, 
which will be denoted by Kr is the ratio of the computed stress at rupture for a plain 
specimen to the computed stress at rupture for the specimen contain­ing the stress raiser. 
For the case just described, it would be the ratio of the modulus of rupture of the plain 
beam to that of the notched beam, the latter being calculated for the net section. Kr is 
therefore a ratio of stresses, one or both of which may be fictitious, but is none­theless a 
measure of the strength-reducing effect of stress concentra­tion. Some values of Kr are 
given in Table 17 of Ref. 1.
It is for conditions involving fatigue that stress concentration is most important. 
Even the most highly localized stresses, such as those produced by small surface 
scratches, may greatly lower the apparent endurance limit, but materials vary greatly in 
notch sensitivity, as susceptibility to this effect is sometimes called. Contrary to what 
might be expected, ductility (as ordinarily determined by axial testing) is not a measure 
of immunity to stress concentration in fatigue; for example, steel is much more suscep-
tible than cast iron. What may be termed the fatigue stress concentration factor Kf is the 
practical measure of notch sensitivity. It is the ratio of the endurance limit of a plain 
specimen to the nominal stress at the endurance limit of a specimen containing the 
stress raiser.
A study of available experimental data shows that Kf is almost always less, and 
often significantly less, than Kt  , and various methods for estimating Kf from Kt have 
been proposed. Neuber (Ref. 37) proposes the formula

where ω is the flank angle of the notch (called θ in Table 17.1), ρ is the radius of curva-
ture (in inches) at the root of the notch (called r in Table 17.1), and ρ′ is a dimension 
related to the grain size, or size of some type of basic building block, of the material and 
may be taken as 0.0189 in for steel.
All the methods described are valuable and applicable within certain limitations, 
but none can be applied with confidence to all situations (Ref. 29). Probably none of 
them gives sufficient weight to the effect of scale in the larger size range. There is abun-
dant evidence to show that the significance of stress concentration increases with size 
for both static and repeated loading, especially the latter.
An important fact concerning stress concentration is that a single isolated notch or 
hole has a worse effect than have a number of similar stress raisers placed close together; 
thus, a single V-groove reduces the strength of a part more than does a continuous screw 
thread of almost identical form. The deleterious effect of an unavoidable stress raiser 
can, therefore, be mitigated sometimes by juxtaposing additional form irregularities of 
like nature, but the actual superposition of stress raisers, such as the introduction of a 
small notch in a fillet, may result in a stress concentration factor equal to or even exceed-
ing the product of the factors for the individual stress raisers (Refs. 30 and 43).
3.11  Effect of Form and Scale on Strength; Rupture Factor
It has been pointed out (Sec. 3.7) that a member composed of brittle material breaks in 
tension when the maximum tensile stress reaches the ultimate strength or in shear when 
the maximum compressive stress reaches a certain value. In calculating the stress at 

T h e  B e h a v i o r  o f  B o d i e s  u n d e r  S t r e s s 	
61
rupture in such a member it is customary to employ an elastic-stress formula; thus the 
ultimate fiber stress in a beam is usually calculated by the ordinary flexure formula. It 
is known that the result (modulus of rupture) is not a true stress, but it can be used to 
predict the strength of a similar beam of the same material. However, if another beam 
of the same material but of different cross section, span/depth ratio, size, or manner of 
loading and support is tested, the modulus of rupture will be found to be different. (The 
effect of the shape of the section is often taken into account by the form factor, and the 
effects of the span/depth ratio and manner of loading are recognized in the testing 
procedure.) Similarly, the calculated maximum stress at rupture in a curved beam, flat 
plate, or torsion member is not equal to the ultimate strength of the material, and the 
magnitude of the disparity will vary greatly with the material, form of the member, 
manner of loading, and absolute scale. In order to predict accurately the breaking 
load for such a member, it is necessary to take this variation into account, and the 
rupture factor (defined in App. C) provides a convenient means of doing so. Values 
of the rupture factor for a number of materials and types of members are given in 
Table 18 of Ref. 1.
On the basis of many experimental determinations of the rupture factor (Ref. 35), 
the following generalizations may be made:
	
1.	 The smaller the proportional part of the member subjected to high stress, the 
larger the rupture factor. This is exemplified by the facts that a beam of circular 
section exhibits a higher modulus of rupture than a rectangular beam and that 
a flat plate under a concentrated center load fails at a higher computed stress 
than one uniformly loaded. The extremes in this respect are, on the one hand, a 
uniform bar under axial tension for which the rupture factor is unity and, on 
the other hand, a case of severe stress concentration such as a sharply notched 
bar for which the rupture factor may be indefinitely large.
	
2.	 In the flexure of statically indeterminate members, the redistribu­tion of bending 
moments that occurs when plastic yielding starts at the most highly stressed 
section increases the rupture factor. For this reason a flat plate gives a higher 
value than a simple beam, and a circular ring gives a higher value than a portion 
of it tested as a statically determinate curved beam.
	
3.	 The rupture factor seems to vary inversely with the absolute scale for conditions 
involving abrupt stress variation, which is consistent with the fact (already 
noted) that for cases of stress concentration both Kr and Kf diminish with the 
absolute scale.
	
4.	 As a rule, the more brittle the material, the more nearly all rupture factors 
approach unity. There are, however, many exceptions to this rule. It has been 
pointed out (Sec. 3.10) that immunity to notch effect even under static loading 
is not always proportional to ductility.
The practical significance of these facts is that for a given material and given factor 
of safety, some members may be designed with a much higher allowable stress than 
others. This fact is often recognized in design; for example, the allowable stress for 
wooden airplane spars varies according to the form factor and the proportion of the 
stress that is flexural.
What has been said here pertains especially to comparatively brittle materials, i.e., 
materials for which failure consists in fracture rather than in the beginning of plastic

C h a p t e r  T h r e e
deformation. The effect of form on the ultimate strength of ductile members is less 
important, although even for steel the allowable unit stress is often chosen with regard 
to circumstances such as those discussed previously. For instance, in gun design the 
maximum stress is allowed to approach and even exceed the nominal elastic limit, the 
volume of material affected being very small, and in structural design extreme fiber 
stresses in bending are permitted to exceed the value allowed for axial loading. In test-
ing, account must be taken of the fact that some ductile metals exhibit a higher ultimate 
strength when fracture occurs at a reduced section such as would be formed in a tensile 
specimen by a concentric groove or notch. Whatever effect of stress concentration may 
remain during plastic deformation is more than offset by the supporting action of the 
shoulders, which tends to prevent the normal “necking down.”
3.12  Prestressing
Parts of an elastic system, by accident or design, may have introduced into them stresses 
that cause and are balanced by opposing stresses in other parts, so that the system 
reaches a state of stress without the imposition of any external load. Examples of such 
initial, or locked-up, stresses are the temperature stresses in welded members, stresses 
in a statically indeterminate truss due to tightening or “rigging” some of the members 
by turnbuckles, and stresses in the flange couplings of a pipeline caused by screwing 
down the nuts. The effects of such prestressing upon the rigidity and strength of a sys-
tem will now be considered, the assumption being made that prestressing is not so 
severe as to affect the properties of the material.
In discussing this subject it is necessary to distinguish two types of systems, viz., 
one in which the component parts can sustain reversal of stress and one in which at 
least some of the component parts cannot sustain reversal of stress. Examples of the first 
type are furnished by a solid bar and by a truss, all members of which can sustain either 
tension or compression. Examples of the second type are furnished by the bolt-flange 
combination mentioned and by a truss with wire diagonals that can take tension only.
For the first type of system, prestressing has no effect on initial rigidity. Thus a plain 
bar with locked-up temperature stresses will exhibit the same modulus of elasticity as 
a similar bar from which these stresses have been removed by annealing; two pre-
stressed helical springs arranged in parallel, the tension in one balancing the compres-
sion in the other, will deflect neither more nor less than the same two springs similarly 
placed without prestressing.
Prestressing will lower the elastic limit (or allowable load, or ultimate strength) 
provided that in the absence of prestressing all parts of the system reach their respective 
elastic limits (or allowable loads, or ultimate strengths) simultaneously. But if this rela-
tion between the parts does not exist, then prestressing may raise any or all of these 
quantities. One or two examples illustrating each condition may make this clear.
Consider first a plain bar that is to be loaded in axial tension. If there are no 
locked-up stresses, then (practically speaking) all parts of the bar reach their allowable 
stress, elastic limit, and ultimate strength simultaneously. But if there are locked-up 
stresses present, then the parts in which the initial tension is highest reach their elastic 
limit before other parts, and the elastic limit of the bar as a whole is thus lowered. The 
load at which the allowable unit stress is first reached is similarly lowered, and the 
ultimate strength may also be reduced; although if the material is ductile, the equaliza-
tion of stress that occurs during elongation will largely prevent this.

T h e  B e h a v i o r  o f  B o d i e s  u n d e r  S t r e s s 	
63
As an example of the second condition (all parts do not simulta­neously reach the 
elastic limit or allowable stress) consider a thick cylinder under internal pressure. If the 
cylinder is not prestressed, the stress at the interior surface reaches the elastic limit first 
and so governs the pressure that may be applied. But if the cylinder is prestressed by 
shrinking on a jacket or wrapping with wire under tension, as is done in gun construc-
tion, then the walls are put into an initial state of compression. This compressive stress 
also is greatest at the inner surface, and the pressure required to reverse it and produce 
a tensile stress equal to the elastic limit is much greater than before. As another example, 
consider a composite member comprising two rods of equal length, one aluminum and 
the other steel, that are placed side by side to jointly carry a tensile load. For simplicity, 
it will be assumed that the allowable unit stresses for the materials are the same. Because 
the modulus of elasticity of the steel is about three times that of the aluminum, it will 
reach the allowable stress first and at a total load less than the sum of the allowable loads 
for the bars acting separately. But if the composite bar is properly prestressed, the steel 
being put into initial compression and the aluminum into initial tension (the ends being 
in some way rigidly connected to permit this), then on the application of a tensile load 
the two bars will reach the allowable stress simultaneously, and the load-carrying capac-
ity of the combination is thus greater than before. Similarly the elastic limit and some-
times the ultimate strength of a composite member may be raised by prestressing.
In a system of the second type (in which all parts cannot sustain stress reversal) 
prestressing increases the rigidity for any load less than that required to produce stress 
reversal. The effect of prestressing up to that point is to make the rigidity of the system 
the same as though all parts were effective. Thus in the case of the truss with wire 
diagonals, it is as though the counterwires were taking compression; in the case of the 
flange-bolt combination, it is as though the flanges were taking tension. (If the flanges 
are practically rigid in comparison with the bolts, there is no deformation until the 
applied load exceeds the bolt tension and so the system is rigid.) When the applied load 
becomes large enough to cause stress reversal (to make the counterwires go slack or to 
separate the flanges), the effect of prestressing disappears and the system is neither 
more nor less rigid than a similar one not prestressed provided, of course, none of the 
parts has been overstressed.
The elastic limit (or allowable load, or ultimate strength) of a system of this type is 
not affected by prestressing unless the elastic limit (or allowable load, or ultimate 
strength) of one or more of the parts is reached before the stress reversal occurs. In 
effect, a system of this type is exactly like a system of the first type until stress reversal 
occurs, after which all effects of prestressing vanish.
The effects of prestressing are often taken advantage of, notably in bolted joints 
(flanges, cylinder heads, etc.), where high initial tension in the bolts prevents stress 
fluctuation and consequent fatigue, and in prestressed reinforced-concrete members, 
where the initially compressed concrete is enabled, in effect, to act in tension without 
cracking up to the point of stress reversal. The example of the prestressed thick cylinder 
has already been mentioned.
3.13  Elastic Stability
Under certain circumstances the maximum load a member will sustain is determined 
not by the strength of the material but by the stiffness of the member. This condition 
arises when the load produces a bending or a twisting moment that is proportional 

64	
C h a p t e r  T h r e e
to the correspond­ing deformation. The most familiar example is the Euler column. 
When a straight slender column is loaded axially, it remains straight and suffers only 
axial compressive deformation under small loads. If while thus loaded it is slightly 
deflected by a transverse force, it will straighten after removal of that force. But there 
is obviously some axial load that will just hold the column in the deflected position, 
and since both the bending moment due to the load and the resisting moment due to 
the stresses are directly proportional to the deflection, the load required thus to hold 
the column is independent of the amount of the deflection. If this condition of bal-
ance exists at stresses less than the elastic limit, the condition is called elastic stability, 
and the load that produces this condition is called the critical load. Any increase of 
the load beyond this critical value is usually attended by immediate collapse of the 
member.
It is the compressive stresses within long, thin sections of a struc­ture that can 
cause instabilities. The compressive stress can be elastic or inelastic, and the instabil-
ity can be global or local. Global instabil­ities can cause catastrophic failure, whereas 
local instabilities may cause permanent deformation but not necessarily a catastrophic 
fail­ure. For the Euler column, when instability occurs, it is global since the entire cross 
section is involved in the deformation. Localized buckling of the edges of the flange 
in compression of a wide-flange I-beam in bending can occur. Likewise, the center of 
the web of a transversely loaded I-beam or plate girder in bending undergoes pure 
shear where along the diagonal (45°) compressive stresses are present and localized 
buckling is possible.
Other examples of elastic stability are afforded by a thin cylinder under external 
pressure, a thin plate under edge compression or edge shear, and a deep thin cantilever 
beam under a transverse end load applied at the top surface. Some such elements, 
unlike the simple column described previously, do not fail under the load that initiates 
elastic buckling but demonstrate increasing resistance as the buckling progresses. Such 
postbuckling behavior is important in many problems of shell design. Elastic stability 
is discussed further in Chap. 15, and formulas for the critical loads for various members 
and types of loadings are given in Tables 15.1 and 15.2.

Principles and  
Analytical Methods
M
ost of the formulas of mechanics of materials express the relations among the 
form and dimensions of a member, the loads applied thereto, and the result-
ing stress or deformation. Any such formula is valid only within certain limi-
tations and is applicable only to certain problems. An understanding of these limitations 
and of the way in which formulas may be combined and extended for the solution of 
problems to which they do not immediately apply requires a knowl­edge of certain prin-
ciples and methods that are stated briefly in this chapter. The significance and use of 
these principles and methods are illustrated in Chaps. 7 to 16 by examples that accom-
pany the discussion of specific problems.
4.1  Equations of Motion and of Equilibrium
The relations that exist at any instant between the motion of a body and the forces act-
ing on it may be expressed by these two equations: (1) Fx (the component along any line 
x of all forces acting on a body) = max (the product of the mass of the body and the x 
component of the acceleration of its mass center); (2) Tx (torque about any line x of all 
forces acting on the body) = dH
dt
x/
 (the time rate at which its angular momentum 
about that line is changing). If the body in question is in equilibrium, these equations 
reduce to (1) Fx = 0 and (2) Tx = 0.
These equations, Hooke’s law, and experimentally determined values of the elastic 
constants E, G, and ν constitute the basis for the mathematical analysis of most prob-
lems of mechanics of materials. The majority of the common formulas for stress are 
derived by considering a portion of the loaded member as a body in equilibrium under 
the action of forces that include the stresses sought and then solving for these stresses 
by applying the equations of equilibrium.
4.2  Principle of Superposition
With certain exceptions, the effect (stress, strain, or deflection) produced on an elastic 
system by any final state of loading is the same whether the forces that constitute that 
loading are applied simultaneously or in any given sequence and is the result of the 
effects that the several forces would produce if each acted singly.

84	
C h a p t e r  F o u r
An exception to this principle is afforded by any case in which some of the forces 
cause a deformation that enables other forces to produce an effect they would not have 
otherwise. A beam subjected to trans­verse and axial loading is an example; the trans-
verse loads cause a deflection that enables the longitudinal load to produce a bending 
effect it would not produce if acting alone. In no case does the principle apply if the 
deformations are so large as to alter appreciably the geometrical relations of the parts of 
the system.
The principle of superposition is important and has many applica­tions. It often 
makes it possible to resolve or break down a complex problem into a number of simple 
ones, each of which can be solved separately for like stresses, deformations, etc., which 
are then alge­braically added to yield the solution of the original problem.
4.3  Principle of Reciprocal Deflections
Let A and B be any two points of an elastic system. Let the displace­ment of B in any 
direction U due to force P acting in any direction V at A be u; and let the displacement of 
A in the direction V due to a force Q acting in the direction U at B be v. Then Pv = Qu.
This is the general statement of the principle of reciprocal deflec­tions. If P and Q are 
equal and parallel and u and v are parallel, the statement can be simplified greatly. 
Thus, for a horizontal beam with vertical loading and deflection understood, the prin-
ciple expresses the following relation: A load applied at any point A produces the same 
deflection at any other point B as it would produce at A if applied at B.
The principle of reciprocal deflections is a corollary of the principle of superposition 
and so can be applied only to cases for which that principle is valid. It can be used to 
advantage in many problems involving deformation. Examples of the application of the 
principle are given in Chaps. 8 and 11.
4.4  Method of Consistent Deformations (Strain Compatibility)
Many statically indeterminate problems are easily solved by utilizing the obvious rela-
tions among the deformations of the several parts or among the deformations produced 
by the several loads. Thus, the division of load between the parts of a composite mem-
ber is readily ascertained by expressing the deformation or deflection of each part in 
terms of the load it carries and then equating these deformations or deflections. For 
example, the reaction at the supported end of a beam with one end fixed and the other 
supported can be found by regarding the beam as a cantilever, acted on by the actual 
loads and an upward end load (the reaction), and setting the resultant deflection at the 
support end equal to zero.
The method of consistent deformations is based on the principle of superposition; it 
can be applied only to cases for which that principle is valid.
4.5  Energy Methods
In addition to the differential equations method the analysis of stress and deformation 
can be accomplished through the use of energy methods. These methods are based on 
minimization of energy associated with deformation and stress. Energy methods are 
effective in problems involving complex shapes and cross sections. In particular, strain

85
energy methods offer simple approaches for computation of displacements of struc-
tural and machine elements subjected to combined loading.
Principles and Methods Involving Strain Energy
Strain energy is defined as the mechanical energy stored up in an elastically stressed 
system; formulas for the amount of strain energy developed in members under various 
conditions of loading are given in Chaps. 7 to 15. It is the purpose of this article to state 
certain relations between strain energy and external forces that are useful in the analy-
sis of stress and deformation. For convenience, external forces with points of applica-
tion that do not move will here be called reactions, and external forces with points of 
application that move will be called loads.
External Work Equal to Strain Energy
When an elastic system is subjected to static loading, the external work done by the 
loads as they increase from zero to their maximum value is equal to the strain energy 
acquired by the system.
This relation may be used directly to determine the deflection of a system under a 
single load; for such a case, assuming a linear material, it shows that the deflection at 
the point of loading in the direction of the load is equal to twice the strain energy 
divided by the load. The relationship also furnishes a means of determining the critical 
load that produces elastic instability in a member. A reason­able form of curvature, com-
patible with the boundary conditions, is assumed, and the corresponding critical load 
found by equating the work of the load to the strain energy developed, both quantities 
being calculated for the curvature assumed. For each such assumed curva­ture, a corre-
sponding approximate critical load will be found and the least load so found represents 
the closest approximation to the true critical load (see Refs. 3–5).
4.6  Castigliano’s Theorem
In 1873 Alberto Castigliano, an Italian engineer, employed Betti’s reciprocal theorem 
and developed a formula for linearly elastic structures that is known as Castigliano’s 
Theorem. The theorem states that for a linear structure, the partial derivative of the 
strain energy, U, with respect to external load, Pi , is equal to the deflection, δi , of the 
structure at the point of the application and in the direction of that load. In equation 
form, the theorem is
∂
∂
=
U
Pi
iδ
Similarly, in the case of an applied moment, Castigliano’s theorem can also be written as 
∂
∂
=
U
Ci
iθ
where, Ci is the bending moment or twisting torque and θi is the associated rotation, 
slope, or angle of twist at the point of applied moment (see Refs. 8–9).

86	
C h a p t e r  F o u r
In applying Castigliano’s theorem, the strain energy must be expressed as a func-
tion of a load. If the structure is subjected to a combination of loads, for example, 
axial load N, bending moment M, shearing force V, torsional moment T, the strain 
energy is

where α is the shape factor and is equal to 10/9, 2, and 6/5 for circle, thin walled circu-
lar and rectangular respectively. For beams with I-section, box section, or channels the 
value of α is equal to A/Aweb where A is the entire area of the cross section and Aweb = ht 
is the area of the web, assuming that h is the beam depth and t is the web thickness.
Note that the last integral is valid only for a circular cross section.∗ Using Castigliano’s

Method of Unit Loads 
During the static loading of an elastic system the external work done by a constant force 
acting thereon is equal to the internal work done by the stresses caused by that con-
stant force. This relationship is the basis of the following method for finding the deflec-
tion of any given point of an elastic system: A unit force is imagined to act at the point 
in question and in the direction of the deflection that is to be found. The stresses pro-
duced by such a unit force will do a certain amount of internal work during the appli-
cation of the actual loads. This work, which can be readily found, is equal to the work 
done by the unit force; but since the unit force is constant, this work is equal to the 
deflection sought.
If the direction of the deflection cannot be ascertained in advance, its horizontal and 
vertical components can be determined separately in the way described and the resultant 
deflection found therefrom. Examples of application of the method are given in Sec. 7.4.
Deflection, the Partial Derivative of Strain Energy
When a linear elastic system is statically loaded, the partial derivative of the strain 
energy with respect to any one of the applied forces is equal to the movement of the 
point of application of that force in the direction of that force. This relationship pro-
vides a means of finding the deflection of a beam or truss under several loads (see 
Refs. 3, 5, and 7).

Theorem of Least Work*
When an elastic system is statically loaded, the distribution of stress is such as to make 
the strain energy a minimum consistent with equilibrium and the imposed boundary 
conditions. This principle is used extensively in the solution of statically indeterminate 
problems. In the simpler type of problem (beams with redundant supports or trusses 
with redundant members), the first step in the solution consists in arbitrarily selecting 
certain reactions or members to be considered redundant, the number and identity of 
these being such that the remaining system is just determinate. The strain energy of the 
entire system is then expressed in terms of the unknown redundant reactions or stresses. 
The partial derivative of the strain energy with respect to each of the redundant reac-
tions or stresses is then set equal to zero and the resulting equations solved for the 
redundant reactions or stresses. The remaining reactions or stresses are then found by 
the equations of equilibrium. An example of the application of this method is given in 
Sec. 7.4.
As defined by this procedure, the theorem of least work is implicit in Castigliano’s 
theorem: It furnishes a method of solution identical with the method of consistent 
deflections, the deflection used being zero and expressed as a partial derivative of the 
strain energy. In a more general type of problem, it is necessary to determine which of 
an infinite number of possible stress distributions or configurations satisfies the condi-
tion of minimum strain energy. Since the develop­ment of software based on the finite-
element method of analysis the electronic computer has made practicable the solution 
of many problems of this kind—shell analysis, elastic and plastic buckling, etc.—that 
formerly were relatively intractable.
4.7  Dimensional Analysis
Most physical quantities can be expressed in terms of mass, length, and time con-
veniently represented by the symbols M, L, and t, respectively. Thus velocity is Lt -1, 
acceleration is Lt-2, force is MLt-2, unit stress is ML t
-
-
1
2, etc. A formula in which the 
several quantities are thus expressed is a dimensional formula, and the various 
applications of this system of representation constitute dimensional analysis.
Dimensional analysis may be used to check formulas for homogeneity, check or 
change units, derive formulas, and establish the relationships between similar physical 
systems that differ in scale (e.g., a model and its prototype). In strength of materials, 
dimensional analysis is especially useful in checking formulas for homogeneity. To do 
this, it is not always necessary to express all quantities dimensionally since it may be pos-
sible to cancel some terms. Thus it is often convenient to express force by some symbol, 
as F, until it is ascertained whether or not all terms representing force can be canceled.
For example, consider the formula for the deflection y at the free end of a canti-
lever beam of length l carrying a uniform load per unit length, w. This formula 
(Table 8.1) is
y
wl
EI
= - 1

To test for homogeneity, omit the negative sign and the coefficient 1/8 (which is dimen-
sionless) and write the formula

P r i n c i p l e s  a n d  A n a l y t i c a l  M e t h o d s  	
91

F L L
F L L

It is seen that F cancels and the equation reduces at once to L = L, showing that the 
original equation was homogeneous.
Instead of the symbols M, L, t, and F, we can use the names of the units in which 
the quantities are to be expressed. Thus the above equation may he written
inches
pounds inch inches
pounds inch
inche
4
= (
)(
)
(
)(

s
inches

=
This practice is especially convenient if it is desired to change units. Thus it might be 
desired to write the above formula so that y is given in inches when l is expressed in 
feet. It is only necessary to write
inches
pounds inch feet
pounds inche
=
×

12 4
(
)(
)
(

)
and the coefficient is thus found to be 2592 instead of 1/8.
By what amounts to a reversal of the checking process described, it is often possible 
to determine the way in which a certain term or terms should appear in a formula pro-
vided the other terms involved are known. For example, consider the formula for the 
critical load of the Euler column. Familiarity with the theory of flexure suggests that 
this load will be directly proportional to E and I. It is evident that the length l will be 
involved in some way as yet unknown. It is also reasonable to assume that the load is 
independent of the deflection since both the bending moment and the resisting moment 
would be expected to vary in direct proportion to the deflection. We can then write 
P
kEIla
=
, where k is a dimensionless constant that must be found in some other way 
and the exponent a shows how l enters the expression. Writing the equation dimension-
ally and omitting k, we have
F

or
Equating the exponents of L (as required for homogeneity) we find a = -2, showing 
that the original formula should be P
kEI l
=
/ 2. Note that the derivation of a formula in 
this way requires at least a partial knowledge of the relationship that is to be expressed.
A much more detailed discussion of similitude, modeling, and dimensional analy-
sis can be found in Chaps. 15 and 8 of Refs. 6 and 7, respectively. Reference 6 includes a 
section where the effect of Poisson’s ratio on the stresses in two- and three-dimensional 
problems is discussed. Since Poisson’s ratio is dimensionless, it would have to be the 
same in model and prototype for perfect modeling and this generally is not possible. 
References to work on this problem are included and will be helpful.
4.8  Remarks on the Use of Formulas
No calculated value of stress, strength, or deformation can be regarded as exact. The 
formulas used are based on certain assumptions as to properties of materials, regularity 
of form, and boundary conditions that are only approximately true, and they are derived 
by mathema­tical procedures that often involve further approximations. In general, 
therefore, great precision in numerical work is not justified. Each individual problem 

92	
C h a p t e r  F o u r
requires the exercise of judgment, and it is impos­sible to lay down rigid rules of proce-
dure; but the following sugges­tions concerning the use of formulas may be of value:
	
1.	 For most cases, calculations giving results to three significant figures are 
sufficiently precise. An exception is afforded by any calculation that involves 
the algebraic addition of quantities that are large in comparison with the final 
result (e.g., some of the formulas for beams under axial and transverse loading, 
some of the formulas for circular rings, and any case of superposition in which 
the effects of several loads tend to counteract each other). For such cases more 
significant figures should be carried throughout the calculations.
	
2.	 In view of uncertainties as to actual conditions, many of the formulas may 
appear to be unnecessarily elaborate and include constants given to more 
significant figures than is warranted. For this reason, we may often be inclined 
to simplify a formula by dropping unimportant terms, “rounding off’’ constants, 
etc. It is sometimes advantageous to do this, but it is usually better to use the 
formula as it stands, bearing in mind that the result is at best only a close 
approximation. The only disadvantage of using an allegedly “precise’’ formula 
is the possibility of being misled into thinking that the result it yields corresponds 
exactly to a real condition. So far as the time required for calculation is concerned, 
little is saved by simplification.
	
3.	 When using an unfamiliar formula, we may be uncertain as to the correctness 
of the numerical substitutions made and mistrustful of the result. It is nearly 
always possible to effect some sort of check by analogy, superposition, reciprocal 
deflections, comparison, or merely by judgment and common sense. Thus the 
membrane analogy (Sec. 6.4) shows that the torsional stiffness of any irregular 
section is greater than that of the largest inscribed circular section and less than 
that of the smallest circumscribed section. Superposition shows that the 
deflection and bending moment at the center of a beam under triangular 
loading (Table 8.1, case 2e) is the same as under an equal load uniformly 
distributed. The principle of reciprocal deflections shows that the stress and 
deflection at the center of a circular flat plate under eccentric concentrated load 
(Table 11.2, case 18) are the same as for an equal load uniformly distributed 
along a concentric circle with radius equal to the eccentricity (case 9a). 
Comparison shows that the critical unit compressive stress is greater for a thin 
plate under edge loading than for a strip of that plate regarded as a Euler 
column. Common sense and judgment should generally serve to prevent the 
acceptance of grossly erroneous calculations.
	
4.	 A difficulty frequently encountered is uncertainty as to boundary conditions—
whether a beam or flat plate should be calculated as freely supported or fixed, 
whether a load should be assumed uniformly or otherwise distributed, etc. In any 
such case it is a good plan to make bracketing assumptions, i.e., to calculate the 
desired quantity on the basis of each of two assumptions representing limits 
between which the actual conditions must lie. Thus for a beam with ends 
having an unknown degree of fixity, the bending moment at the center cannot 
be more than if the ends were freely supported and the bending moments at the 
ends cannot be more than if the ends were truly fixed. If so designed as to be 

P r i n c i p l e s  a n d  A n a l y t i c a l  M e t h o d s  	
93
safe for either extreme condition, the beam will be safe for any intermediate 
degree of fixity.
	
5.	 The stress and deflections predicted by most formulas do not account for 
localized effects of the loads. For example, the stresses and deflections given for 
a straight, simply-supported beam with a centered, concentrated lateral force 
only account for that due to bending. Additional compressive bearing stresses 
and deflections exist depending on the exact nature of the interaction of the 
applied and reaction forces with the beam. Normally, the state of stress and 
deformation at distances greater than the dimensions of the loaded regions 
only depend on the net effect of the localized applied and reaction forces and 
are independent of the form of these forces. This is an application of Saint 
Venant’s principle (defined in App. C). This principle may not be reliable for 
thin-walled structures or for some orthotropic materials.
	
6.	 Formulas concerning the validity of which there is a reason for doubt, especially 
empirical formulas, should be checked dimensionally. If such a formula 
expresses the results of some intermediate condition, it should be checked for 
extreme or terminal conditions; thus an expression for the deflection of a beam 
carrying a uniform load over a portion of its length should agree with the 
corresponding expression for a fully loaded beam when the loaded portion 
becomes equal to the full length and should vanish when the loaded portion 
becomes zero.

Numerical Methods
T
he analysis of stress and deformation of the loading of simple geometric struc-
tures can usually be accomplished by closed-form techniques. As the structures 
become more complex, the analyst is forced to approximations of closed-form 
solutions, experimentation, or numerical methods. There are a great many numerical 
techniques used in engineering applications for which digital computers are very useful. 
In the field of structural analysis, the numerical techniques generally employ a method 
which discretizes the continuum of the structural system into a finite collection of points 
(or nodes) whereby mathematical relations from elasticity are formed. The most popu-
lar techniques used currently are the finite element method (FEM) and boundary ele-
ment method (BEM). For this reason, most of this chapter is dedicated to a general 
description of these methods. A great abundance of papers and textbooks have been 
presented on the finite element and the boundary element methods, and a complete 
listing is beyond the scope of this book. However, some textbooks and historical papers 
are included for introductory purposes. Other methods, some of which FEM is based 
upon, include trial functions via variational methods and weighted residuals, the finite dif-
ference method (FDM), structural analogues, and the boundary element method (BEM). In 
this chapter, other numerical methods such as finding zeroes of polynomials, solution 
of differential equations and numerical integrations are also presented.
5.1  The Finite Difference Method
In the field of structural analysis, one of the earliest procedures for the numerical 
solutions of the governing differential equations of stressed continuous solid bodies 
was the finite difference method. In the finite difference approximation of differential 
equations, the derivatives in the equations are replaced by difference quotients of the 
values of the dependent variables at discrete mesh points of the domain. Finite differ-
ence method generally employs three types of quotations known as forward, backward, 
and central differences. 
A forward difference is the difference between the function values at x and x + h as
	
∆ f (x) = f (x + h) - f (x)	
where h is the spacing between two adjacent points, which is a constant or variable. 
However, a backward difference uses the function values at x and x − h, and is 
expressed as
	
∇f (x) = f (x) - f (x - h)	

96	
C h a p t e r  F i v e
Finally, the central difference is given by

/  for a non-zero and small h. This is forward 
difference derivative of function f. 
Assuming that f is continuous and differentiable, and using the Taylor’s theo-
rem, the error in the forward and backward approximation can be derived, and it is 
in the order of h, i.e., as h goes to zero, the error approaches to zero. However, the 
error in the central difference is in the order of h2, i.e., it yields a more accurate 
approximation.
To solve a problem, the domain of the differential equation is discretized and the 
derivatives in the differential equation are replaced by one of the quotations of the 
finite difference approximations. After imposing the appropriate boundary conditions 
on the structure, the discrete equations are solved obtaining the values of the variables 
at the mesh points. The technique has many disadvantages, including inaccuracies of 
the derivatives of the approximated solution, difficulties in imposing boundary conditions 
along curved boundaries, difficulties in accurately representing complex geometric 
domains, and the inability to utilize non-uniform and non-rectangular meshes.
5.2  The Finite Element Method
The finite element method (FEM) evolved from the use of trial functions via variational 
methods and weighted residuals, the finite difference method, and structural analogues 
(see Table 1.1 of Ref. 1). FEM overcomes the difficulties encountered by the finite differ­
ence method in that the solution of the differential equations of the structural problem 
is obtained by utilizing an integral formulation to generate a system of algebraic equa-
tions with continuous piecewise- smooth (trial) functions that approximate the unknown 
quantities. A geometrically complex domain of the structural problem can be system-
atically represented by a large, but finite, collection of simpler subdomains, called finite 
elements. For structural problems, the displacement field of each element is approxi-
mated by polynomials, which are interpolated with respect to preselected points (nodes) 
on, and possibly within, the element. The polynomials are referred to as interpolation 
functions, where variational or weighted residual methods (e.g., Rayleigh–Ritz, Galerkin, 
etc.) are applied to determine the unknown nodal values. Boundary conditions can easily 
be applied along curved boundaries, complex geometric domains can be modeled, and 
non-uniform and non-rectangular meshes can be employed.
The modern development of FEM began in the 1940s in the field of structural 
mechanics with the work of Hrennikoff, McHenry, and Newmark, who used a lattice 
of line elements (rods and beams) for the solution of stresses in continuous solids 

N u m e r i c a l  M e t h o d s 	
97
(see Refs. 2–4). In 1943, from a 1941 lecture, Courant suggested piecewise-polynomial 
inter­polation over triangular subregions as a method to model torsional problems 
(see Ref. 5).
With the advent of digital computers in the 1950s, it became practical for engineers 
to write and solve the stiffness equations in matrix form (see Refs. 6–8). A classic paper 
by Turner, Clough, Martin, and Topp published in 1956 presented the matrix stiffness 
equations for the truss, beam, and other elements (see Ref. 9). The expression finite element 
is first attributed to Clough (see Ref. 10).
Since these early beginnings, a great deal of effort has been expended in the 
development of FEM in the areas of element formula­tions and computer implemen-
tation of the entire solution process. The major advances in computer technology 
include the rapidly expand­ing computer hardware capabilities, efficient and accu-
rate matrix solver routines, and computer graphics for ease in the preprocessing 
stages of model building, including automatic adaptive mesh genera­tion, and in the 
postprocessing stages of reviewing the solution results. A great abundance of litera-
ture has been presented on the subject, including many textbooks. A partial list of 
some textbooks, introduc­tory and more comprehensive, is given at the end of this 
chapter. For a brief introduction to FEM and modeling techniques, see Chaps. 9 and 
10, respectively, of Ref. 11.

Implementation of the Finite Element Method
FEM is ideally suited to digital computers, in which a continuous elastic structure (con-
tinuum) is divided (discretized) into small but finite well-defined substructures (elements). 
Using matrices, the continuous elastic behavior of each element is categorized in terms of 
the element’s material and geometric properties, the distribution of loading (static, 
dynamic, and thermal) within the element, and the loads and displacements at the nodes 
of the element. The element’s nodes are the fundamental governing entities of the ele-
ment, since it is the node where the element connects to other elements, where elastic 
properties of the element are established, where boundary conditions are assigned, and 
where forces (contact or body) are ultimately applied. A node possesses degrees of freedom 
(dof’s). Degrees of freedom are the translational and rotational motion that can exist at a 
node. At most, a node can possess three translational and three rotational degrees of free-
dom. Once each element within a structure is defined locally in matrix form, the elements 
are then globally assembled (attached) through their common nodes (dof’s) into an over-
all system matrix. Applied loads and boundary conditions are then specified, and through 
matrix operations the values of all unknown displacement degrees of freedom are deter-
mined. Once this is done, it is a simple matter to use these displacements to determine 
strains and stresses through the constitutive equations of elasticity.
Many geometric shapes of elements are used in finite element analysis for specific 
applications. The various elements used in a general-purpose commercial FEM soft-
ware code constitute what is referred to as the element library of the code. Elements can 
be placed in the following categories: line elements, surface elements, solid elements, and 
special purpose elements. Table 5.1 provides some, but not all, of the types of elements 
available for finite element analysis.
Since FEM is a numerical technique that discretizes the domain of a continuous 
structure, errors are inevitable. These errors are:
	
1.	 Computational Errors  These are due to round-off errors from the computer 
floating-point calculations and the formulations of the numerical integration 
schemes that are employed. Most commercial finite element codes concentrate

2.	 Discretization Errors  The geometry and the displacement distri­bution of a true 
structure vary continuously. Using a finite number of elements to model the 
structure introduces errors in matching geometry and the displacement 
distribution due to the inherent limitations of the elements. For example, 
consider the thin-plate structure shown in Fig. 5.1(a). Figure 5.1(b) shows a 
finite element model of the structure where three-noded, plane-stress, triangular 
elements are employed. The plane-stress triangular element has a flaw, which 
creates two basic problems. The element has straight sides, which remain 
straight after deformation. The strains throughout the plane-stress triangular 
element are constant. The first problem, a geometric one, is the modeling of 
curved edges. Note that the surface of the model with a large curvature appears 
reasonably modeled, whereas the surface of the hole is very poorly modeled. 
The second problem, which is much more severe, is that the strains in various 
regions of the actual structure are changing rapidly, and the constant-strain 
element will only provide an approximation of the average strain at the center 
of the element. So, in a nutshell, the results predicted using this model will be 
relatively poor. The results can be improved by significantly increasing the 
number of elements used (increased mesh density). Alternatively, using a better 
element, such as an eight-noded quad­rilateral, which is more suited to the 
application, will provide the improved results. Due to higher-order interpolation 
functions, the eight-noded quadrilateral element can model curved edges and 
provide for a higher-order function for the strain distribution.
5.3  The Boundary Element Method
The idea of boundary element method (BEM), also known as bound integral equation method 
(BIEM), developed more recently than FEM, is that the governing partial differential 
equation (or PDE) of a domain is transformed into an integral equation on the boundary 

102	
C h a p t e r  F i v e
and then uses the boundary solution to find the solution of the problem inside the 
domain, (see Refs. 12–16). This transformation is commonly accomplished through 
the Green’s Integral Equations. Since differential equation of the domain is transferred to 
an integral equation on the boundary, the dimension of the problem is reduced by one, 
i.e., a two-dimensional problem is reduced to a line integer (one dimension) and a three 
dimensional problem is reduced to a surface integral (two dimension). The dimension 
reduction feature of the BEM makes it very attractive for problems involving very large 
domains where FEM solution requires large number of elements. That is, unlike the 
finite element method, in the boundary element method the domain does not need 
to be discretized into finite elements, rather only the boundary is discretized (Fig. 5.2). 
However, in the boundary element method a fundamental solution or the Green’s function 
is needed. A comparison of the two methods is shown in the table below.

This is the boundary-integral equation relating the boundary values of f and g. If f is 
prescribed on the boundary, then this equation leads to a Fredholm equation of the first 
kind, and if g is prescribed on the boundary, the equation leads to a Fredholm equation 
of the second kind. In either case, f and g can be determined numerically by subdividing 
the boundary into boundary elements. Once f and g are determined, the solution of 
Laplacian at any point in the region can be calculated using Eq. (5.3-8).
Indirect Method
In the indirect approach, the region Ω is embedded into an infinite region Ω’ for which 
the fundamental solution, or the Green’s function is known (see Fig. 5.4). We then sub-
jected the boundary to a layer of unknown source points P*(x’). Using the superposi-

BEM in Elasticity
Direct Method
In the direct approach, which is due Rizzo (Ref. 12), consider an elastic region R with 
boundary B subjected to a traction and displacement boundary as shown in Fig. 5.5.
Two states of stresses are considered: One is the traction influence function, T* 
and the second one is displacement influence function, U*. Both T* and U* are 
known as influence functions or the “Green’s Function,” and their solution for an 
infinite elastic region is known as Love’s solution. Rizzo employed Betti’s reciprocal 
theorem and arrived at

given by Eq. (5.3-13). 
Indirect Method
In the indirect method, similar to Laplacian we embed the region R into an infinite 
region of the same materials. Then, we subject a fictitious layer of body force P*(x) on 
the boundary points, Fig. 5.6.

Substituting Eq. (5.3-15) into (5.3-16) leads to the integral equation. By subdividing the 
boundary into elements one can solve the integral equations numerically. Note that bound-
ary elements for a general three-dimensional solid are quadrilateral or triangular surface 
elements covering the surface area of the component. Also for two-dimensional and axi-
symmetric problems, only line elements tracing the outline of the component are used. 
5.4  Zeroes of Polynomials
Newton—Raphson Method
Let x0 be an approximate root of the equation f (x) = 0, and let x1 = x0 + h be the exact root, 
then f (x1) = 0.
Expanding  f (x0 + h) in a Taylor’s series, we have
	
f (x0) + hf ′(x0) + h2f ′′ (x0)/2! + … … … … … = 0	
Since h is small, neglecting h2 and higher powers of h, we get
	
f (x0) + hf ′(x0) = 0	
or	
 h = - f (x0)/f ′(x0)	
A closer approximation to the root is given by
	
 x1 = x0 - f (x0)/ f ′(x0)	
Similarly starting with x1 , a still better approximation x2 is given by
	
x2 = x1 - f (x0)/f ′(x0) 	
In general,	
 xn + 1 = xn - f (x0)/ f ′(x0)    (n = 0, 1, 2, 3 … …)	
This method is known as the Newton-Raphson formula or Newton’s iteration formula.
Gauss—Elimination Method
To solve a system of linear equations, n equations, n unknown, the Gauss-Elimination 
method is employed. In this method, the unknowns are eliminated successively and 
the system of equations are reduced to an upper triangular system from which the 
unknowns are found by back substitution. 
Consider the system of equations
	
a1x + b1y + c1z = d1 	
	
 a2x + b2 y + c2z = d2	
 (1)
	
a3x + b3y + c3z = d3	
Using simple subtraction techniques and eliminating x from second and third equa-
tions we get
	
a1x + b1y + c1z = d1	
	
b2′y + c2′z = d2′	
(2)
	
b3′y + c3′z = d3′	

108	
C h a p t e r  F i v e
In the next step, eliminate y from third equation in (2) we have
a1x + b1y + c1z = d1
	
b2′y + c2′z = d2′	
(3)
	
c3′′ z = d3′′	
The values of x, y, z are found from the reduced system (3) by back substitution. Thus the 
unknowns are found by Gauss-Elimination method.

Chapter 6
Experimental Methods
A 
structural member may be of such a form or may be loaded in such a way that 
the direct use of formulas for the calculation of stress and strain produced in it  
 is ineffective. One then must resort either to numerical techniques such as that 
presented in Chap. 5, finite element method or to experimental methods. Experimental 
methods can be applied to the actual member in some cases, or to a model thereof. 
Which choice is made depends upon the results desired, the accuracy needed, the prac-
ticality of size, and the cost associated with the experimental method. There has been a 
tremendous increase in the use of numerical methods over the years, but the use of 
experimental methods is still very effective. Many investigations make use of both 
numerical and experimental results to cross feed information from one to the other for 
increased accuracy and cost effectiveness. Some of the more important experimental 
methods are described briefly in Sec. 6.1 of this chapter. Of these methods, the most 
popular method employs electrical resistance strain gages and is described in more 
detail in Sec. 6.2. Only textbooks, reference books, handbooks, and lists of journals are 
referenced, since there are several organizations (see Refs. 1, 25, and 26) devoted either 
partially or totally to experimental methods, and a reasonable listing of papers would 
be excessive and soon out of date. The most useful reference for users wanting informa-
tion on experimental methods is Ref. 27, the “Handbook on Experimental Mechanics,” 
edited by A. S. Kobayashi and dedicated to the late Dr. M. Hetenyi, who edited Ref. 2. 
Reference 27 contains 22 chapters contributed by 27 authors under the sponsorship of 
the Society for Experimental Mechanics. Experimental methods applied specifically to 
the field of fracture mechanics are treated extensively in Refs. 13, 15, 17, 19, 22, and 
Chaps. 14 and 20 of Ref. 27.
6.1  Measurement Techniques
The determination of stresses produced under a given loading of a structural system by 
means of experimental techniques is based on the measurement of deflections. Since 
strain is directly related to (the rate of change of) deflection, it is common practice to say 
that the measurements made are that of strain. Stresses are then determined implicitly 
using the stress–strain relations. Deflections in a structural system can be measured 
through changes in resistance, capacitance, or inductance of electrical elements; optical 
effects of interference, diffraction, or refraction; or thermal emissions. Measurement is 
comparatively easy when the stress is fairly uniform over a considerable length of the 
part in question, but becomes more difficult when the stress is localized or varies greatly 
with position. Short gage lengths and great precision require stable gage elements and 

114	
C h a p t e r  S i x
stable electronic amplification if used. If dynamic strains are to be measured, a suitable 
high-frequency response is also necessary. In an isotropic material undergoing uniaxial 
stress, one normal strain measurement is all that is necessary. On a free surface under 
biaxial stress conditions, two measured orthogonal normal strains will provide the 
stresses in the same directions of the measured strains. On a free surface under a gen-
eral state of plane stress, three measured normal strains in different directions will allow 
the determination of the stresses in directions at that position (see Sec. 6.2). At a free 
edge in a member that is thin perpendicular to the free edge, the state of stress is uniaxial 
and, as stated earlier, can be determined from one normal strain tangent to the edge. 
Another tactic might be to measure the change in thickness or the through-thickness 
strain at the edge. This might be more practical, such as measuring the strain at the bot-
tom of a groove in a thin plate. For example, assume an orthogonal xyz coordinate 
system where x is parallel to the edge and z is in the direction of the thickness at the 
edge. Considering a linear, isotropic material, from Hooke’s law, ε

The following descriptions provide many of the successful instruments and tech-
niques used for strain measurement. They are listed in a general order of mechanical, 
electrical, optical, and thermal methods. Optical and thermal techniques have been 
greatly enhanced by advances in digital image processing technology for computers 
(see Chap. 21 of Ref. 27).
Mechanical Measurement
A direct measurement of strain can be made with an Invar tape over a gage length of 
several meters or with a pair of dividers over a reasonable fraction of a meter. For shorter 
gage lengths, mechanical amplification can be used, but friction is a problem and vibra-
tion can make them difficult to mount and to read. Optical magnification using mirrors 
still requires mechanical levers or rollers and is an improvement but still not satisfac-
tory for most applications. In a laboratory setting, however, such mechanical and opti-
cal magnification can be used successfully. See Ref. 3 for more detailed descriptions. A 
scratch gage uses scratches on a polished target to determine strain amplitudes, and 
while the scratches are in general not strictly related to time, they are usually related to 
events in such a way as to be extremely useful in measuring some dynamic events. The 
scratched target is viewed with a microscope to obtain peak-to-peak strains per event, 
and a zero strain line can also be scratched on the target if desired (Ref. 3). The use of 
lasers and/or optical telescopes with electronic detectors to evaluate the motion of fidu-
ciary marks on distant structures makes remote-displacement measurements possible, 
and when two such detectors are used, strains can be measured. While the technique is 
valuable when needed for remote measurement, generally for environmental reasons, it 
is an expensive technique for obtaining the strain at a single location.
Brittle Coatings
Surface coatings formulated to crack at strain levels well within the elastic limit of most 
structural materials provide a means of locating points of maximum strain and the direc-
tions of principal strains. Under well-controlled environmental conditions and with 
suitable calibration, such coatings can yield quantitative results (Refs. 2, 3, 7, 9, 20, 21, 
and 27). This technique, however, is not universally applicable, since the coatings may 
not be readily available due to environmental problems with the coating materials.

Electrical Strain and Displacement Gages 
The evolution of electrical gages has led to a variety of configurations where changes in 
resistance, capacitance, or inductance can be related to strain and displacement with 
proper instrumentation (Refs. 2–5, 20, 21, 23, 24, and 27).
(a) Resistance Strain Gage
For the electrical resistance strain gages, the gage lengths vary from less than 0.01 in. to 
several inches. The gage grid material can be metallic or a semiconductor. The gages 
can be obtained in alloys that are designed to provide minimum output due to tem-
perature strains alone and comparatively large outputs due to stress-induced strains. 
Metallic bonded-foil gages are manufactured by a photoetching process that allows 
for a wide range of configurations of the grid(s). The semiconductor strain gages 
provide the largest resistance change for a given strain, but are generally very sensi-
tive to temperature changes. They are used in transducers where proper design can 
provide temperature compensation. The use of electrical resistance strain gages for 
stress analysis purposes constitutes the majority of experimental applications. For 
this reason, Sec. 6.2 provides further information on the use of these gages.
(b) Capacitance Strain Gage
Capacitance strain gages are larger and more massive than bonded electric resistance 
strain gages and are more widely used for applications beyond the upper temperature 
limits of the bonded resistance strain gages.
(c) Inductance Strain Gages
The change in air gap in a magnetic circuit can create a large change in inductance 
depending upon the design of the rest of the magnetic circuit. The large change in induc-
tance is accompanied by a large change in force across the gap, and so the very sensitive 
inductance strain gages can be used only on more massive structures. They have been 
used as overload indicators on presses with no electronic amplification necessary. The 
linear relationship between core motion and output voltage of a linear differential trans-
former makes possible accurate measurement of displacements over a wide range of 
gage lengths and under a wide variety of conditions. The use of displacement data as 
input for work in experimental modal analysis is discussed in Chap. 16 of Ref. 27 and in 
many of the technical papers in Ref. 24.
lnterferometric Strain Gages
Whole-field interferometric techniques will be discussed later, but a simple strain gage 
with a short length and high sensitivity can be created by several methods. In one, a 
diffraction grating is deposited at the desired location and in the desired direction, and 
the change in grating pitch under strain is measured. With a metallic grid, these strain 
gages can be used at elevated temperatures. Another method, also useable at high tem-
peratures, makes use of the interference of light reflected from the inclined surfaces of 
two very closely spaced indentations in the surface of a metallic specimen. Both of these 
methods are discussed and referenced in Ref. 27.
Photoelastic Analysis
When a beam of polarized light passes through an elastically stressed transparent iso-
tropic material, the beam may be treated as having been decomposed into two rays

polarized in the planes of the principal stresses in the material. In birefringent materials 
the indexes of refraction of the material encountered by these two rays will depend 
upon the principal stresses. Therefore, interference patterns will develop which are pro-
portional to the differences in the principal stresses.
(a) Two-Dimensional Analysis 
With suitable optical elements—polarizers and wave plates of specific relative retarda-
tion—both the principal stress differences and the directions of principal stresses may 
be determined at every point in a two-dimensional specimen (Refs. 2–6, 10, 14, 18, 27, 
and 28). Many suitable photoelastic plastics are available. The material properties that 
must be considered are transparency, sensitivity (relative index of refraction change 
with stress), optical and mechanical creep, modulus of elasticity, ease of machining, 
cost, and stability (freedom from stresses developing with time). Materials with appro-
priate creep properties may be used for photoplasticity studies (Ref. 16).
(b) Three-Dimensional Analysis 
Several photoelastic techniques are used to determine stresses in three-dimensional 
specimens. If information is desired at a single point only, the optical polarizers, wave 
plates, and photoelastically sensitive material can be embedded in a transparent model 
(Ref. 2) and two-dimensional techniques used. A modification of this technique, stress 
freezing, is possible in some biphase materials. By heating, loading, cooling, and unload-
ing, it is possible to lock permanently into the specimen, on a molecular level, strains 
proportional to those present under load. Since equilibrium exists at a molecular level, 
the specimen can be cut into two-dimensional slices and all secondary principal stress 
differences determined. The secondary principal stresses at a point are defined as the 
largest and smallest normal stresses in the plane of the slice; these in general will not 
correspond with the principal stresses at that same point in the three-dimensional 
structure. If desired, the specimen can be cut into cubes and the three principal stress 
differences determined. The individual principal stresses at a given point cannot be 
determined from photoelastic data taken at that point alone since the addition of a 
hydrostatic stress to any cube of material would not be revealed by differences in the 
indexes of refraction. Mathematical integration techniques, which start at a point where 
the hydrostatic stress component is known, can be used with photoelastic data to deter-
mine all individual principal stresses.
A third method, scattered light photoelasticity, uses a laser beam of intense monochro-
matic polarized light or a similar thin sheet of light passing through photoelastically 
sensitive transparent models that have the additional property of being able to scatter 
uniformly a small portion of the light from any point on the beam or sheet. The same 
general restrictions apply to this analysis as applied to the stress-frozen three-dimensional 
analysis except that the specimen does not have to be cut. However, the amount of light 
available for analysis is much less, the specimen must be immersed in a fluid with an 
index of refraction that very closely matches that of the specimen, and in general the data 
are much more difficult to analyze.
(c) Photoelastic Coating
Photoelastic coatings have been sprayed, bonded in the form of thin sheets, or cast 
directly in place on the surface of models or structures to determine the two-dimensional 
surface strains. The surface is made reflective before bonding the plastics in place so the 

E x p e r i m e n t a l  M e t h o d s 	
117
effective thickness of the photoelastic plastic is doubled and all two-dimensional tech-
niques can be applied with suitable instrumentation.
Moiré Techniques
All moiré techniques can be explained by optical interference, but the course-grid 
techniques can also be evaluated on the basis of obstructive or mechanical interference.
(a) Geometric Moiré
Geometric moiré techniques use grids of alternate equally wide bands of relatively 
transparent or light-colored material and opaque or dark-colored material in order to 
observe the relative motion of two such grids. The most common technique (Refs. 2, 5, 
8, and 11) uses an alternate transparent and opaque grid to produce photographically a 
matching grid on the flat surface of the specimen. Then the full-field relative motion is 
observed between the reproduction and the original when the specimen is loaded. Sim-
ilarly, the original may be used with a projector to produce the photographic image on 
the specimen and then produce interference with the projected image after loading. 
These methods can use ordinary white light, and the interference is due merely to geo-
metric blocking of the light as it passes through or is reflected from the grids.
Another similar technique, shadow moiré, produces interference patterns due to 
motion of the specimen at right angles to its surface between an alternately transparent 
and opaque grid and the shadow of the grid on the specimen.
(b) Moiré Interferometry
Interferometry provides a means of producing both specimen gratings and reference 
gratings. Virtual reference gratings of more than 100,000 lines per inch have been uti-
lized. Moiré interferometry provides contour maps of in-plane displacements, and, 
with the fine pitches attainable, differentiation to obtain strains from this experimental 
process is comparable to that used in the finite-element method of numerical analysis 
where displacement fields are generally the initial output. See Chap. 7 in Ref. 27.
Holographic and Laser Speckle Interferometry
The rapid evolution of holographic and laser speckle interferometry is related to the 
development of high-power lasers and to the development of digital computer enhance-
ment of the resulting images. Various techniques are used to measure the several dis-
placement components of diffuse reflecting surfaces. Details are beyond the scope of 
this book and are best reviewed in Chap. 8 of Ref. 27.
Shadow Optical Method of Caustics
The very simple images created by the reflection or refraction of light from the surface 
contours of high-gradient stress concentrations such as those at the tips of cracks make 
the use of the shadow optical method of caustics very useful for dynamic studies of 
crack growth or arrest. Chapter 9 of Ref. 27 gives a detailed discussion of this technique 
and a comparison to photoelastic studies for the same loadings.
X-ray Diffraction
X-ray diffraction makes possible the determination of changes in interatomic distance 
and thus the measurement of elastic strain. The method has the particular advantages 

118	
C h a p t e r  S i x
that it can be used at points of high stress concentration and to determine residual 
stresses without cutting the object of investigation.
Stress-Pattern Analysis by Thermal Emission
This technique uses computer enhancement of infrared detection of very small tem-
perature changes in order to produce digital output related to stress at a point on the 
surface of a structure, a stress graph along a line on the surface, or a full-field isopachic 
stress map of the surface. Under cyclic loading, at a frequency high enough to assure 
that any heat transfer due to stress gradients is insignificant, the thermoelastic effect 
produces a temperature change proportional to the change in the sum of the principal 
stresses. Although calibration corrections must be made for use at widely differing 
ambient temperatures, the technique works over a wide range of temperatures and on 
a variety of structural materials including metals, wood, concrete, and plain and rein-
forced plastics. Tests have been made on some metals at temperatures above 700°C. 
Chapter 14 of Ref. 27 describes and surveys work on this technique.
6.2  Electrical Resistance Strain Gages
General
The use of electrical resistance strain gages is probably the most common method of 
measurement in experimental stress analysis. In addition, strain gage technology is 
quite important in the design of transducer instrumentation for the measurement of 
force, torque, pressure, etc.
Electrical resistance strain gages are based on the principal that the resistance R of a 
conductor changes as a function of normal strain ε. The resistance of a conductor can be 
expressed as
	
R
L
A
= ρ
	
(6.2-1)
where ρ is the resistivity of the conductor (ohms-length), and L and A are the length and 
cross-sectional area of the conductor, respectively. It can be shown that a change in R 
due to changes in ρ, L, and A is given by

(6.2-2)
where ν is Poisson’s ratio, and assuming small strain on the conductor, ε, which is given 
by ∆L/L. If the change in the resistance of the conductor is considered to be only due to 
the applied strain, then Eq. (6.2-2) can be written as

Sa is the sensitivity of the conductor to strain∗. The first two terms come directly from 
changes in dimension of the conductor where for most metals the quantity 1
2
+ ν varies 
from 1.4 to 1.7. The last term in Eq. (6.2-4) is called the change in specific resistance rela-
tive to strain, and for some metals can account for much of the sensitivity to strain. The 
most commonly used material for strain gages is a copper–nickel alloy called Constantan, 
which has a strain sensitivity of 2.1. Other alloys used for strain gage applications are 
modified Karma, Nichrome V, and Isoelastic, which have sensitivities of 2.0, 2.2, and 
3.6, respectively. The primary advantages of Constantan are:
	
1.	 The strain sensitivity Sa is linear over a wide range of strain and does not change 
significantly as the material goes plastic.
	
2.	 The thermal stability of the material is excellent and is not greatly influenced by 
temperature changes when used on common structural materials.
	
3.	 The metallurgical properties of Constantan are such that they can be processed 
to minimize the error induced due to the mismatch in the thermal expansion 
coefficients of the gage and the structure to which it is adhered over a wide 
range of temperature.
Isoelastic, with a higher sensitivity, is used for dynamic applications. Semiconductor 
gages are also available, and can reach sensitivities as high as 175. However, care must 
be exercised with respect to the poor thermal stability of these piezoresistive gages.
Most gages have a nominal resistance of 120 ohm or 350 ohm. Considering a 120-ohm 
Constantan gage, to obtain a measurement of strain within an accuracy of ±5 µ, it would 
be necessary to measure a change in resistance within ±1.2 mohm. To measure these small 
changes in resistance accurately, commercial versions of the Wheatstone bridge, called 
strain gage indicators, are available.
Metallic alloy electrical resistance strain gages used in experimental stress analysis 
come in two basic types: bonded-wire and bonded-foil (see Fig. 6.1). Today, bonded- 
foil gages are by far the more prevalent. The resistivity of Constantan is approximately 
49 µohm cm
⋅
. Thus if a strain gage is to be fabricated using a wire 0.025 mm in diameter 
and is to have a resistance of 120 ohm, the gage would require a wire approximately  
120 mm long. To make the gage more compact over a shorter active length, the gage is 
constructed with many loops as shown in Fig. 6.1. Typical commercially available 
bonded-foil gage lengths vary from 0.20 mm (0.008 in.) to 101.6 mm (4.000 in.). For nor-
mal applications, bonded-foil gages either come mounted on a very thin polyimide film 
carrier (backing) or are encapsulated between two thin films of polyimide. Other carrier 
materials are available for special cases such as high-temperature applications.
The most widely used adhesive for bonding a strain gage to a test structure is the 
pressure-curing methyl 2-cyanoacrylate cement. Other adhesives include epoxy, poly-
ester, and ceramic cements.
Extreme care must be exercised when installing a gage, since a good bond and an 
electrically insulated gage are necessary. The installation procedures can be obtained from 
technical instruction bulletins supplied by the manufacturer. Once a gage is correctly 
∗When using a commercial strain indicator, one must enter the sensitivity provided by the gage 
manufacturer. This sensitivity is referred to the gage factor of the gage, Sg . This is defined slightly 
differently than Sa and will be discussed shortly.

mounted, wired, resistance tested for continuity and insulation from the test structure, 
and waterproofed (if appropriate), it is ready for instrumentation and testing.
Strain Gage Configurations 
In both wire or foil gages, many configurations and sizes are available. Strain gages 
come in many forms for transducer or stress-analysis applications. The fundamental 
configurations for stress-analysis work are shown in Fig. 6.2.
A strain gage is mounted on a free surface, which in general, is in a state of plane 
stress where the state of stress with regards to a specific xy rectangular coordinate sys-
tem can be unknown up to the three stresses, σx , σy , and τxy . Thus, if the state of stress 
is completely unknown on a free surface, it is necessary to use a three-element rectan-
gular or delta rosette since each gage element provides only one piece of information, 
the indicated normal strain at the point in the direction of the gage.
To understand how the rosettes are used, consider the three-element rectangular 
rosette shown in Fig. 6.3(a), which provides normal strain components in three direc-
tions spaced at angles of 45°.
If an xy coordinate system is assumed to coincide with gages A and C, then εx = εA 
and εy = εC. Gage B in conjunction with gages A and C provides information necessary 
to determine γxy. Recalling the first of Eqs. (2.4-1), ε

Strain Gage Corrections 
There are many types of corrections that may be necessary to obtain accurate strain 
gage results (see Refs. 27 and 28). Two fundamental corrections that are necessary cor-
rect the indicated strain errors due to strains on the specimen perpendicular (trans-
verse) to the longitudinal axis of the gage and changes in temperature of the gage 
installation. With each strain gage, the manufacturer provides much information on the 
performance of the gage, such as its sensitivity to longitudinal and transverse strain 
and how the sensitivity of the gage behaves relative to temperature changes.
(a) Transverse Sensitivity Corrections
The strain sensitivity of a single straight uniform length of conductor in a uniform uni-
axial strain field ε in the longitudinal direction of the conductor is given by Eq. (6.2-3), 
which is S
R R
a = (
)
∆/
/ε. In a general strain field, there will be strains perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis of the conductor (transverse strains). Due to the width of the conductor 
elements and the geometric configuration of the conductor in the gage pattern, the trans-
verse strains will also effect a change in resistance in the conductor. This is not desirable, 
since only the effect of the strain in the direction of the gage length is being sought.
To further complicate things, the sensitivity of the strain gage provided by the 
gage manufacturer is not based on a uniaxial strain field, but that of a uniaxial stress 
field in a tensile test specimen. For a uniaxial stress field let the axial and transverse 
strains be εa and εt respectively. The sensitivity provided by the gage manufacturer, 
called the gage factor Sg  , is defined as S

The tan-1 is defined from 0° to 360°. For example, tan-1(+/+) is in the range 0°–90°, tan-1(+/-) is in the 
range 90°–180°, tan-1(-/-) is in the range 180°–270°, and tan-1(-/+) is in the range 270°–360°. Using this 
definition for θp, the calculation will yield the counterclockwise angle from the x axis to σp1, the greater 
of the two principal stresses in the plane of the gages.

0  , then some error will occur. This error depends on the sensitiv-
ity of the gage to transverse strain and the deviation of the ratio of εt/εa from -ν0. The 
strain gage manufacturer generally supplies a transverse sensitivity coefficient, Kt , 
defined as St/Sa , where St is the transverse sensitivity factor. One cannot correct the 
indicated strain from a single strain reading. Thus it is necessary to have multiple strain 
readings from that of a strain gage rosette. Table 6.2 at the end of the chapter gives equa-
tions for the corrected strain values of the three most widely used strain gage rosettes. 
Corrected strain readings are given by ε whereas uncorrected strains from the strain 
gage indicator are given by ˆε.

The principal stress element is shown in Fig. 6.5 relative to the xy coordinate system of the gage rosette 
as shown in Fig. 6.3(a).
(b) Corrections Due to Temperature Changes
Temperature changes on an installed strain gage cause a change in resistance, which is 
due to a mismatch in the thermal expansion coefficients of the gage and the specimen, 
a change in the resistivity of the gage material, and a change in the gage factor, Sg. This 
effect can be compensated for by two different methods. The first method of tempera-
ture compensation is achieved using an additional compensating gage on an adjacent 
arm of the Wheatstone bridge circuit. This compensating gage must be identical to the 
active gage, mounted on the same material as the active gage, and undergoing an iden-
tical temperature change as that of the active gage.
The second method involves calibration of the gage relative to temperature changes. 
The gage can be manufactured and calibrated for the application on a specific specimen 
material. The metallurgical properties of alloys such as Constantan and modified Karma 
can be processed to minimize the effect of temperature change over a limited range of 
temperatures, somewhat centered about room temperature. Gages processed in this 
manner are called self-temperature-compensated strain gages. An example of the charac-
teristics of a BLH self-temperature-compensated gage specifically processed for use on 
a low-carbon steel is shown in Fig. 6.6. Note that the apparent strain is zero at 22°C and 
45°C and approximately zero in the vicinity of these temperatures. For temperatures 
beyond this region, compensation can be achieved by monitoring the temperature at 
the strain gage site. Then, using either the curve from the data sheet or the fitted poly-
nomial equation, the strain readings can be corrected numerically. Note, however, that 
the curve and the polynomial equation given on the data sheet are based on a gage

factor of 2.0. If corrections are anticipated, the gage factor adjustment of the strain 
indicator should be set to 2.0. An example that demonstrates this correction is given at 
the end of this section.
The gage factor variation with temperature is also presented in the data sheet of 
Fig. 6.6. If the strain gage indicator is initially set at (Sg)i , the actual gage factor at 
temperature T is (Sg)T , and the indicator registers a strain measurement of εreading , the 
corrected strain is

Example  A strain gage with the characteristics of Fig. 6.6 has a room-temperature gage factor of 2.1 
and is mounted on a 1018 steel specimen. A strain measurement of -1800 µ is recorded during the test 
when the temperature is 150°C. Determine the value of actual test strain if:
	
(a)	 the gage is in a half-bridge circuit with a dummy temperature compensating gage and prior to 
testing, the indicator is zeroed with the gage factor set at 2.1.
	
(b)	 the gage is the only gage in a quarter-bridge circuit and prior to testing, the indicator is zeroed 
with the gage factor set at 2.0.
Solution  From Fig. 6.6, the gage factor variation at 150°C is ∆Sg(%) = 1.13%. Thus, from Eq. (6.2-7), the 
gage factor at the test temperature is

(a)	 Since in this part, a dummy gage is present that cancels the apparent strain, the only correction

6.3  Detection of Plastic Yielding
In parts made of ductile metal, sometimes a great deal can be learned concerning the loca-
tion of the most highly stressed region and the load that produces elastic failure by noting 
the first signs of plastic yielding. Such yielding may be detected in the following ways.
Observation of Slip Lines
If yielding occurs first at some point on the surface, it can be detected by the appearance 
of slip lines if the surface is suitably polished.
Brittle Coating
If a member is coated with some material that will flake off easily, this flaking will indi-
cate local yielding of the member. A coating of rosin or a wash of lime or white portland 
cement, applied and allowed to dry, is best for this purpose, but chalk or mill scale will 

E x p e r i m e n t a l  M e t h o d s 	
129
often suffice. By this method zones of high stress such as those that occur in pressure 
vessels around openings and projections can be located and the load required to pro-
duce local yielding can be determined approximately.
Photoelastic Coatings
Thin photoelastic coatings show very characteristic patterns analogous to slip lines 
when the material beneath the coating yields.
6.4  Analogies
Certain problems in elasticity involve equations that cannot be solved but that happen 
to be mathematically identical with the equations that describe some other physical 
phenomenon which can be investigated experimentally. Among the more useful of such 
analogies are the following.
Membrane Analogy
This is especially useful in determining the torsion properties of bars having noncircu-
lar sections. If in a thin flat plate holes are cut having the outlines of various sections 
and over each of these holes a soap film (or other membrane) is stretched and slightly 
distended by pressure from one side, the volumes of the bubbles thus formed are pro-
portional to the torsional rigidities of the corresponding sections and the slope of a 
bubble surface at any point is proportional to the stress caused at that point of the cor-
responding section by a given twist per unit length of bar. By cutting in the plate one 
hole the shape of the section to be studied and another hole that is circular, the torsional 
properties of the irregular section can be determined by comparing the bubble formed 
on the hole of that shape with the bubble formed on the circular hole since the torsional 
properties of the circular section are known.
Electrical Analogy for Isopachic Lines
Isopachic lines are lines along which the sums of the principal stresses are equal in a two-
dimensional plane stress problem. The voltage at any point on a uniform two-dimensional 
conducting surface is governed by the same form of equation as is the principal stress 
sum. Teledeltos paper is a uniform layer of graphite particles on a paper backing and 
makes an excellent material from which to construct the electrical analog. The paper is 
cut to a geometric outline corresponding to the shape of the two-dimensional structure or 
part, and boundary potentials are applied by an adjustable power supply. The required 
boundary potentials are obtained from a photoelastic study of the part where the princi-
pal stress sums can be found from the principal stress differences on the boundaries 
(Refs. 2 and 3). A similar membrane analogy has the height of a nonpressurized mem-
brane proportional to the principal stress sum (Refs. 2 and 3).
6.5  Wheatstone Bridge
To measure the strain with strain gages an electric circuit is needed. The best known 
circuit is the Wheatstone bridge and is used to measure unknown electrical resistances 
by balancing legs of a bridge circuit. Its operation is similar to a potentiometer. The basic

bridge is constructed from four resistances Ri (i = 1 to 4). Initially the bridge is balanced 
such that V2 = 0. To achieve this, R1 R3 = R2 R4. If one of the resistances, say R4 , is a strain 
gage, the resistance will change when the gage is strained. This will cause a change in 
the galvanometer voltage V2. With one unknown active resistance, the bridge is said 
to be a quarter bridge. The bridge can be used for more than one active resistance as 
shown in Table 6.5. Consider the possibility that all four resistances can change from 
Ri to Ri + ∆Ri (i = 1 to 4). With the bridge initially balanced, it can be shown that for very 
small changes in ∆Ri the voltage change is

As discussed in Sec. 6.2, temperature correction can be achieved by using an addi-
tional compensating gage on an adjacent arm of the Wheatstone bridge circuit. This 
compensating (dummy) gage must be identical to the active gage, mounted on the same 
material as the active gage, and undergoing an iden­tical temperature change as that of 
the active gage. Assuming the R4 gage is the active gage and the R3 gage is the dummy 
gage we see from Eq. (6.2-9) that a change in R4 due to temperature is equal to the 
change in R3 and is consequently cancelled. The second bridge in Table 6.5 shows this 
arrangement which is a half bridge arrangement.

Note: The strain gauge equations for several types configurations of bridge are given in this table. To account for unbalanced bridges in the nonstrained state 
and to simplify the bridge equations, we introduce the ration Vr as:
	
Vr = (V2(strained) - V2(unstrained)/V1
  where V2(strained) is the measured output when strained, and V2(unstrained) is the initial, unstrained output voltage. V1 is the excitation voltage.
Also, the designation (+e) and (-e) indicates active strain gages mounted in tension and compression, respectively.
The designation (-ne) indicates that the strain gage is mounted in the transversal direction, so that its resistance change is primarily due to the Poisson’s 
strain, whose magnitude is given as (-ne).
Other nomenclature used in the equations includes:
  RG = nominal resistance value of strain gage
  GF = gage factor of strain gage
  RL = lead resistance

Tension, Compression, 
Shear, and Combined Stress
7.1  Bar under Axial Tension (or Compression); Common Case
The bar is straight, of any uniform cross section, of homogeneous material, and (if under 
compression) short or constrained against lateral buckling. The loads are applied at the 
ends, centrally, and in such a manner as to avoid nonuniform stress distribution at any 
section of the part under consideration. The stress does not exceed the proportional limit.
Behavior
Parallel to the load the bar elongates (under tension) or shortens (under compression), the 
unit longitudinal strain being ε and the total longitudinal deflection in the length l being δ. 
At right angles to the load the bar contracts (under tension) or expands (under compres-
sion); the unit lateral strain ′ε  is the same in all transverse directions, and the total lateral 
deflection ′δ  in any direction is proportional to the lateral dimension d measured in that 
direction. Both longitudinal and lateral strains are proportional to the applied load. On any 
right section there is a uniform tensile (or compressive) stress σ; on any oblique section 
there is a uniform tensile (or compressive) normal stress σθ and a uniform shear stress τθ. 
The deformed bar under tension is represented in Fig. 7.1(a), and the stresses in Fig. 7.1(b).

In some discussions it is convenient to refer to the stiffness of a member, which is a 
measure of the resistance it offers to being deformed. The stiffness of a uniform bar 
under axial load is shown by Eq. (7.1-3) to be proportional to A and E directly and to l 
inversely, i.e., proportional to AE/l.
Example  A cylindrical rod of steel 4 in long and 1.5 in diameter has an axial compressive load of 20,000 lb 
applied to it. For this steel ν = 0.285 and E = 30,000,000 lb/in2. Determine (a) the unit compressive 
stress, σ; (b) the total longitudinal deformation, δ; (c) the total transverse deformation, ′δ ; (d) the change 
in volume, ∆V; and (e) the total energy, or work done in applying the load.

7.2  Bar under Tension (or Compression); Special Cases
If the bar is not straight, it is subject to bending; formulas for this case are given in 
Sec. 12.4.
If the load is applied eccentrically, the bar is subject to bending; formulas for this case 
are given in Secs. 8.7 and 12.4. If the load is compressive and the bar is long and not later-
ally constrained, it must be analyzed as a column by the methods of Chaps. 12 and 15.
If the stress exceeds the proportional limit, the formulas for stress given in Sec. 7.1 
still hold, but the deformation and work done in producing it can be determined only 
from experimental data relating unit strain to unit stress.
If the section is not uniform but changes gradually, the stress at any section can be 
found by dividing the load by the area of that section; the total longitudinal deformation 
over a length l is given by 0
l∫(P/AE) dx, and the strain energy is given by 0
l∫½(P2/AE) dx, 
where dx is an infinitesimal length in the longitudinal direction. If the change in section 
is abrupt stress concentration may have to be taken into account, values of Kt being used 
to find elastic stresses and values of Kr being used to predict the breaking load. Stress 
concentration may also have to be considered if the end attachments for loading involve 
pinholes, screw threads, or other stress raisers (see Sec. 3.10 and Chap. 17).
If instead of being applied at the ends of a uniform bar the load is applied at an 
intermediate point, both ends being held, the method of consistent deformations shows 
that the load is apportioned to the two parts of the bar in inverse proportion to their 
respective lengths.
If a uniform bar is supported at one end in a vertical position and loaded only by its 
own weight, the maximum stress occurs at the supported end and is equal to the weight 
divided by the cross-sectional area. The total elongation is half as great and the total 
strain energy one-third as great as if a load equal to the weight were applied at the 
unsupported end. A bar supported at one end and loaded by its own weight and an 
axial downward load P (force) applied at the unsupported end will have the same unit 
stress σ (force per unit area) at all sections if it is tapered so that all sections are similar 
in form but vary in scale according to the formula 
	
y

A
P
e
= σ
σ
log
	
(7.2-1)
where y is the distance from the free end of the bar to any section, A is the area of that 
section, and w is the density of the material (force per unit volume).
If a bar is stressed by having both ends rigidly held while a change in temperature 
is imposed, the resulting stress is found by calculating the longitudinal expansion (or 
contraction) that the change in temperature would produce if the bar were not held 
and then calculating the load necessary to shorten (or lengthen) it by that amount 
(principle of superposition). If the bar is uniform, the unit stress produced is indepen-
dent of the length of the bar if restraint against buckling is provided. If a bar is stressed 
by being struck an axial blow at one end, the case is one of impact loading, discussed in 
Sec. 16.3.

C h a p t e r  S e v e n
Example 1  Figure 7.2 represents a uniform bar rigidly held at the ends A and D and axially loaded at 
the intermediate points B and C. It is required to determine the total force in each portion of the bar 
AB, BC, CD. The loads are in newtons and the lengths in centimeters.
Solution  Each load is divided between the portions of the bar to right and left in inverse proportion 
to the lengths of these parts (consistent deformations), and the total force sustained by each part 
is the algebraic sum of the forces imposed by the individual loads (superposition). Of the 9000 N 
load therefore 7/9, or 7000 N, is carried in tension by segment AB, and 2/9, or 2000 N, is carried in 
compression by the segment BD. Of the 18,000 N load, 4/9, or 8000 N, is carried in compression by 
segment AC, and 5/9, or 10,000 N, is carried in tension by segment CD. Denoting tension by the plus 
sign and compression by the minus sign, and adding algebraically, the actual stresses in each segment 
are found to be

The results are quite independent of the diameter of the bar and of E provided the bar is completely 
uniform.
If instead of being held at the ends, the bar is prestressed by wedging it between rigid walls under 
an initial compression of, say, 10,000 N and the loads at B and C are then applied, the results secured 
above would represent the changes in force the several parts would undergo. The final forces in the bar 
would therefore be 11,000 N compression in AB, 20,000 N compression in BC, and 2000 N compression 
in CD. But if the initial compression were less than 8000 N, the bar would break contact with the wall 
at D (no tension possible); there would be no force at all in CD, and the forces in AB and BC, now 
statically determinate, would be 9000 and 18,000 N compression, respectively. 
Example 2  A steel bar 24 in long has the form of a truncated cone, being circular in section with 
a diameter at one end of 1 in and at the other of 3 in. For this steel, E = 30,000,000 lb/in2 and the 
coefficient of thermal expansion is 0.0000065/°F. This bar is rigidly held at both ends and subjected 
to a drop in temperature of 50°F. It is required to determine the maximum tensile stress thus caused.
Solution  Using the principle of superposition, the solution is effected in three steps: (a) the shortening 
δ due to the drop in temperature is found, assuming the bar is free to contract; (b) the force P required 
to produce an elongation equal to δ, that is, to stretch the bar back to its original length, is calculated; 
(c) the maximum tensile stress produced by this force P is calculated.
(a)	 δ = 50(0.0000065)(24) = 0.00780 in.

The result can be accepted as correct only if the proportional limit of the steel is known to be as great 
as or greater than the maximum stress and if the concept of a rigid support can be accepted. (See cases 8, 
9, and 10 in Table 14.1.)
7.3  Composite Members
A tension or compression member may be made up of parallel elements or parts which 
jointly carry the applied load. The essential problem is to determine how the load is 
apportioned among the several parts, and this is easily done by the method of consis-
tent deformations. If the parts are so arranged that all undergo the same total elonga-
tion or shortening, then each will carry a portion of the load proportional to its stiffness, 
i.e., proportional to AE/l if each is a uniform bar and proportional to AE if all these 
uniform bars are of equal length. It follows that if there are n bars, with section areas  
A1 , A2 , . . . , An , lengths l1 , l2 , . . . , ln , and moduli E1 , E2 , . . . , En , then the loads on the 
several bars P1 , P2 , . . . , Pn are given by

(7.3-2)
A composite member of this kind can be prestressed. P1 , P2 , etc., then represent the incre-
ments of force in each member due to the applied load, and can be found by Eqs. (7.3-1) 
and (7.3-2), provided all bars can sustain reversal of stress, or provided the applied load 
is not great enough to cause such reversal in any bar which cannot sustain it. As 
explained in Sec. 3.12, by proper prestressing, all parts of a composite member can be 
made to reach their allowable loads, elastic limits, or ultimate strengths simultaneously 
(Example 2).
Example 1  A ring is suspended by three vertical bars, A, B, and C of unequal lengths. The upper ends 
of the bars are held at different levels, so that as assembled none of the bars is stressed. A is 4 ft long, 
has a section area of 0.3 in2, and is of steel for which E = 30,000,000 lb/in2; B is 3 ft long, has a section 
area of 0.2 in2, and is of copper for which E = 17,000,000 lb/in2; C is 2 ft long, has a section area of 
0.4 in2, and is of aluminum for which E = 10,000,000 lb/in2. A load of 10,000 lb is hung on the ring. It 
is required to determine how much of this load is carried by each bar.

Example 2  A composite member is formed by passing a steel rod through an aluminum tube of the same 
length and fastening the two parts together at both ends. The fastening is accomplished by adjustable 
nuts, which make it possible to assemble the rod and tube so that one is under initial tension and 
the other is under an equal initial compression. For the steel rod the section area is 1.5 in2, the modulus 
of elasticity is 30,000,000 lb/in2, and the allowable stress is 15,000 lb/in2. For the aluminum tube the 
section area is 2 in2, the modulus of elasticity is 10,000,000 lb/in2 and the allowable stress is 10,000 lb/in2. 
It is desired to prestress the composite member so that under a tensile load both parts will reach their 
allowable stresses simultaneously.
Solution  When the allowable stresses are reached, the force in the steel rod will be 1.5(15,000) = 22,500 lb, 
the force in the aluminum tube will be 2(10,000) = 20,000 lb, and the total load on the member will be 
22,500 + 20,000 = 42,500 lb. Let Pi denote the initial tension or compression in the members, and, as 
before, let tension be considered positive and compression negative. Then, since Eq. (7.3-1) gives the 
increment in force, we have for the aluminum tube

If the member were not prestressed, the unit stress in the steel would always be just three times as 
great as that in the aluminum because it would sustain the same unit deformation and its modulus of 
elasticity is three times as great. Therefore, when the steel reached its allowable stress of 15,000 lb/in2, 
the aluminum would be stressed to only 5000 lb/in2 and the allowable load on the composite member 
would be only 32,500 lb instead of 42,500 lb.
7.4  Trusses
A conventional truss is essentially an assemblage of straight uniform bars that are sub-
jected to axial tension or compression when the truss is loaded at the joints. The deflec-
tion of any joint of a truss is easily found by the method of unit loads (Sec. 4.5). Let p1 , p2 , p3 , 
etc., denote the forces produced in the several members by an assumed unit load acting in 

Te n s i o n ,  C o m p r e s s i o n ,  S h e a r,  a n d  C o m b i n e d  S t r e s s 	
147
the direction x at the joint whose deflection is to be found, and let δ1 , δ2 , δ3 , etc., denote 
the longitudinal deformations produced in the several members by the actual applied 
loads. The deflection ∆x in the direction x of the joint in question is given by

(7.4-1)
The deflection in the direction y, at right angles to x, can be found similarly by assuming 
the unit load to act in the y direction; the resultant deflection is then determined by 
combining the x and y deflections. Attention must be given to the signs of p and δ: p is 
positive if a member is subjected to tension and negative if under compression, and δ is 
positive if it represents an elongation and negative if it represents a shortening. A posi-
tive value for Σpδ means that the deflection is in the direction of the assumed unit load, 
and a negative value means that it is in the opposite direction. (This procedure is illus-
trated in Example 1 below.)
A statically indeterminate truss can be solved by the method of least work (Sec. 4.5). 
To do this, it is necessary to write down the expression for the total strain energy in the 
structure, which, being simply the sum of the strain energies of the constituent bars, is 
given by

(7.4-2)
Here P1 , P2 , etc., denote the forces in the individual members due to the applied loads 
and δ has the same meaning as above. It is necessary to express each force Pi as the sum 
of the two forces; one of these is the force the applied loads would produce with the 
redundant member removed, and the other is the force due to the unknown force (say, F) 
exerted by this redundant member on the rest of the structure. The total strain energy is 
thus expressed as a function of the known applied forces and F, the force in the redun-
dant member. The partial derivative with respect to F of this expression for strain energy 
is then set equal to zero and solved for F. If there are two or more redundant members, 
the expression for strain energy with all the redundant forces, F1 , F2 , etc., represented is 
differentiated once with respect to each. The equations thus obtained are then solved 
simultaneously for the unknown forces. (The procedure is illustrated in Example 2.)
Example 1  The truss shown in Fig. 7.3 is composed of tubular steel members, for which E = 
30,000,000 lb/in2. The section areas of the members are given in the table below. It is required to 
determine ∆x and ∆y , the horizontal and vertical components of the displacement of joint A produced 
by the indicated loading.

Solution  The method of unit loads is used. The force P in each member due to the applied loads is 
found, and the resulting elongation or shortening δ is calculated. The force px in each member due 
to a load of 1 lb acting to the right at A, and the force py in each member due to a load of 1 lb acting 
down at A are calculated. By Eq. (7.4-1), Σpxδ then gives the horizontal and Σpyδ gives the vertical 
displacement or deflection of A. Tensile forces and elongations are denoted by +, compressive forces 
and shortenings by –. The work is conveniently tabulated as follows:

∆x = 0.03173 in
∆y = 0.17704 in
∆x and ∆y are both found to be positive, which means that the displacements are in the directions 
of the assumed unit loads—to the right and down. Had either been found to be negative, it would 
have meant that the displacement was in a direction opposite to that of the corresponding unit load.
Example 2  Assume a diagonal member, running from A to D and having a section area 0.3318 in2 and 
length 8.544 ft, is to be added to the truss of Example 1; the structure is now statically indeterminate. 
It is required to determine the force in each member of the altered truss due to the loads shown.
Solution  We use the method of least work. The truss has one redundant member; any member except 
BE may be regarded as redundant, since if any one were removed, the remaining structure would be 
stable and statically determinate. We select AD to be regarded as redundant, denote the unknown 
force in AD by F, and assume F to be tension. We find the force in each member assuming AD to 
be removed, then find the force in each member due to a pull F exerted at A by AD, and then add 
these forces, thus getting an expression for the force in each member of the actual truss in terms of F. 
The expression for the strain energy can then be written out, differentiated with respect to F, equated 
to zero, and solved for F. F being known, the force in each member of the truss is easily found. The 
computations are conveniently tabulated as follows:

7.5  Body under Pure Shear Stress
A condition of pure shear may be produced by any one of the methods of loading 
shown in Fig. 7.4. In Fig. 7.4(a), a rectangular block of length a, height b, and uniform 
thickness t is shown loaded by forces P1 and P2 , uniformly distributed over the surfaces 
to which they are applied and satisfying the equilibrium equation P b

In Fig. 7.4(c), a circular shaft is shown under a twisting moment T; a cube of infini-
tesimal dimensions, a distance z from the axis and oriented like ABCD has on each of 
four faces an essentially uniform shear stress τ = Tz J
/  (Sec. 10.1) and no other stress.

In whatever way the loading is accomplished, the result is to impose on an elemen-
tary cube of the loaded body the condition of stress represented in Fig. 7.5, that is, 
shearing stress alone on each of four faces, these stresses being equal and so directed as 
to satisfy the equilibrium condition Tx = 0 (Sec. 4.1).
The stresses, σθ and τθ on a transformed surface rotated counterclockwise through 
the angle θ can be determined from the transformation equations given by Eq. (2.3-17).

The strains produced by pure shear are shown in Fig. 7.5(b), where the cube ABCD 
is deformed into a rhombohedron

strain is related to the shear stress as

7.6  Cases of Direct Shear Loading
By direct shear loading is meant any case in which a member is acted on by equal, paral-
lel, and opposite forces so nearly colinear that the material between them is subjected 
primarily to shear stress, with negligible bending. Examples of this are provided by 
rivets, bolts, and pins, shaft splines and keys, screw threads, short lugs, etc. These are 
not really cases of pure shear; the actual stress distribution is complex and usually

indeterminate because of the influence of fit and other factors. In designing such parts, 
however, it is usually assumed that the shear is uniformly distributed on the critical 
section, and since working stresses are selected with due allowance for the approximate 
nature of this assumption, the practice is usually permissible. In beams subject to trans-
verse shear, this assumption cannot be made as a rule.
Shear and other stresses in rivets, pins, keys, etc., are discussed more fully in Chap. 14, 
shear stresses in beams in Chap. 8, and shear stresses in torsion members in Chap. 10.
7.7  Combined Stress
Under certain circumstances of loading, a body is subjected to a combination of tensile 
and compressive stresses (usually designated as biaxial or triaxial stress) or to a combi-
nation of tensile, compressive, and shear stresses (usually designated as combined stress). 
For example, the material at the inner surface of a thick cylindrical pressure vessel is 
subjected to triaxial stress (radial compression, longitudinal tension, and circumferen-
tial tension), and a shaft simultaneously bent and twisted is subjected to combined 
stress (longitudinal tension or compression, and torsional shear).
In most instances the normal and shear stresses on each of three mutually perpen-
dicular planes are due to flexure, axial loading, torsion, beam shear, or some combina-
tion of these which separately can be calculated readily by the appropriate formulas. 
Normal stresses arising from different load conditions acting on the same plane can be 
combined simply by algebraic addition considering tensile stresses positive and com-
pressive stresses negative. Similarly, shear stresses can be combined by algebraic addi-
tion following a consistent sign convention. Further analysis of the combined states of 
normal and shear stresses must be performed using the transformation techniques out-
lined in Sec. 2.3. The principal stresses, the maximum shear stress, and the normal and 
shear stresses on any given plane can be found by the equations given in Sec. 2.3.
The strains produced by any combination of stresses not exceeding the proportional 
limit can also be found using Hooke’s law for each stress and then combined by super-
position. Consideration of the strains caused by equal triaxial stresses leads to an 
expression for the bulk modulus of elasticity given by

Example 1  A rectangular block 12 in long, 4 in high, and 2 in thick is subjected to a longitudinal tensile 
stress σ x = 12,000 lb/in2, a vertical compressive stress σ y = 15,000 lb/in2, and a lateral compressive 
stress σ z = 9000 lb/in2. The material is steel, for which E = 30,000,000 lb/in2 and ν = 0.30. It is required 
to find the total change in length.
Solution  The longitudinal deformation is found by superposition. The unit strain due to each stress 
is computed separately by Eqs. (7.1-2) and (7.1-4); these results are added to give the resultant 
longitudinal unit strain, which is multiplied by the length to give the total elongation. Denoting unit 
longitudinal strain by εx and total longitudinal deflection by δx , we have

Example 2  A piece of “standard extra-strong” pipe, 2 in nominal diameter, is simultaneously subjected 
to an internal pressure of p = 2000 lb/in2 and to a twisting moment of T = 5000 lb-in caused by 
tightening a cap screwed on at one end. Determine the maximum tensile stress and the maximum 
shear stress thus produced in the pipe.
Solution  The calculations will be made, first, for a point at the outer surface and, second, for a point 
at the inner surface. The dimensions of the pipe and properties of the cross section are as follows: 
inner radius ri = 0.9695 in, outer radius ro = 1.1875 in, cross-sectional area of bore Ab = 2.955 in2, cross-
sectional area of pipe wall Aw = 1.475 in2, and polar moment of inertial J = 1.735 in4.
We take axis x along the axis of the pipe, axis y tangent to the cross section, and axis z radial in the 
plane of the cross section. For a point at the outer surface of the pipe, σ x is the longitudinal tensile 
stress due to pressure and σ y is the circumferential (hoop) stress due to pressure, the radial stress σ z = 0 
(since the pressure is zero on the outer surface of the pipe), and τxy is the shear stress due to torsion. 
Equation (7.1-1) can be used for σ x, where P

for stress in thick cylinders (Table 13.5, case 1b). Finally, for τxy, we use the formula for torsional stress

Solving this gives σ p = 11 100 2906

, and –2000 lb/in2, which are the principal stresses 
σ1, σ2, and σ3, respectively. Obviously, the maximum tensile stress is 11,100 lb/in2. 
Again, the maximum shear stress comes from Eq. (2.3-25), and is ½ [11,100 – (–2000)] = 
6550 lb/in2.
Note that for this problem, if the pipe is a ductile material, and one were looking at 
failure due to shear stress (see Sec. 3.7), the stress conditions for the pipe are more 
severe at the inner surface compared with the outer surface.
∗ Note: Since τyz = τzx = 0, σz is one of the principal stresses and the other two can be found from the plane 
stress equations. Consequently, the other two principal stresses are in the xy plane.

Beams; Flexure of 
Straight Bars
8.1  Straight Beams (Common Case) Elastically Stressed 
The formulas in this section are based on the following assumptions: (1) The beam is of 
homogeneous material that has the same modulus of elasticity in tension and compres-
sion. (2) The beam is straight or nearly so; if it is slightly curved, the curvature is in the 
plane of bending and the radius of curvature is at least 10 times the depth. (3) The cross 
section is uniform. (4) The beam has at least one longitudinal plane of symmetry. (5) All 
loads and reactions are perpendicular to the axis of the beam and lie in the same plane, 
which is a longitudinal plane of symmetry. (6) The beam is long in proportion to its 
depth, the span/depth ratio being 8 or more for metal beams of compact section, 15 or 
more for beams with relatively thin webs, and 24 or more for rectangular timber beams. 
(7) The beam is not disproportionately wide (see Sec. 8.11 for a discussion on the effect 
of beam width). (8) The maximum stress does not exceed the proportional limit. 
Applied to any case for which these assumptions are not valid, the formulas given 
yield results that at best are approximate and that may be grossly in error; such cases 
are discussed in subsequent sections. The limitations stated here with respect to straight-
ness and proportions of the beam correspond to a maximum error in calculated results 
of about 5%. 
In the following discussion, it is assumed for convenience that the beam is horizon-
tal and the loads and reactions vertical. 
Behavior
As the beam bends, fibers on the convex side lengthen, and fibers on the concave side 
shorten. The neutral surface is normal to the plane of the loads and contains the cen-
troids of all sections, hence the neutral axis of any section is the horizontal central axis. 
Plane sections remain plane, and hence unit fiber strains and stresses are proportional 
to distance from the neutral surface. Longitudinal displacements of points on the neu-
tral surface are negligible. Vertical deflection is largely due to bending, that due to shear 
being usually negligible under the conditions stated. 
There is at any point a longitudinal fiber stress σ, which is tensile if the point 
lies between the neutral and convex surfaces of the beam and compressive if the point 
lies between the neutral and concave surfaces of the beam. This fiber stress σ usually 
may be assumed uniform across the width of the beam (see Secs. 8.11 and 8.12). 

156	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
There is at any point a longitudinal shear stress τ on the horizontal plane and an 
equal vertical shear stress on the transverse plane. These shear stresses, due to the trans-
verse beam forces, may be assumed uniform across the width of the beam (see 
page 158).
Figure 8.1(a,b) represents a beam under load and shows the various dimensions that 
appear in the formulas; Fig. 8.1(c) shows a small stress element at a point q acted on by 
the stresses σ and τ. 
Formulas
Let I = the moment of inertia of the section of the beam with respect to the neutral 
axis and E = modulus of elasticity of the material. 
The fiber stress σ at any point q is

where M has the same meaning as in Eq. (8.1-3) and yc represents the vertical deflection 
of the centroidal axis of the beam. Solution of this equation for the vertical deflection yc 
is effected by writing out the expression for M, integrating twice, and determining the 
constants of integration by the boundary conditions.
By the method of unit loads the vertical deflection at any point is found to be

moment due to a unit load acting vertically at the section where yc is to be found. The 
integration indicated must be performed over each portion of the beam for which either 
M or m is expressed by a different equation. A positive result for yc means that the 
deflection is in the direction of the assumed unit load; a negative result means it is in the 
opposite direction (see Example 2 at the end of this section). 
Using Castigliano’s second theorem the deflection is found to be

within the integral sign; as with Eq. (8.1-6), the integration must extend over the entire 
length of the beam, and the sign of the result is interpreted as before.

These relations are useful in constructing shear and moment diagrams and locating the 
section or sections of maximum bending moment, since Eq. (8.1-10) shows that the maxi-
mum moment occurs when V, its first derivative, passes through zero, and Eq. (8.1-11) 
shows that the increment in bending moment that occurs between any two sections is 
equal to the area under the shear diagram between those sections.
Maximum Fiber Stress

the neutral axis and is given by Eq. (8.1-1) when y

where S is the section modulus, I/c. The maximum fiber stress in the beam occurs at the 
section of greatest bending moment. If the section is not symmetrical about the neutral 
axis, the stresses should be investigated at both the section of greatest positive moment 
and the section of greatest negative moment. 
Maximum Transverse Shear Stress†
The maximum transverse shear stress in the beam occurs at the section of greatest verti-
cal shear. The maximum transverse shear stress at any section occurs at the neutral axis, 
provided the net width b is as small there as anywhere else; if the section is narrower 
elsewhere, the maximum shear stress may not occur at the neutral axis. This maximum 
transverse shear stress can be expressed conveniently by the formula 
	
(
)
τ
α
max V
V
A
=
	
(8.1-13) 
where V/A is the average shear stress on the section and α a is a factor that depends on 
the form of the section. For a rectangular section, α = 3/2 and the maximum stress is at 
the neutral axis; for a solid circular section, α = 4/3 and the maximum stress is at the 
neutral axis; for a triangular section, α = 3/2 and the maximum stress is halfway 
between the top and bottom of the section; for a diamond-shaped section of depth h, 
α = 9/8 and the maximum stress is at points that are a distance h/8 above and below the 
neutral axis. 
In the derivation of Eq. (8.1-2) and in the preceding discussion, it is assumed that 
the shear stress is uniform across the width of the beam; i.e., it is the same at all points 
on any transverse line parallel to the neutral axis. Actually this is not the case; exact 
analysis (Ref. 1) shows that the shear stress varies across the width and that for a rect-
angle the maximum intensity occurs at the ends of the neutral axis where, for a wide 
beam, it is twice the average intensity. Photoelastic investigation of beams under con-
centrated loading shows that localized shearing stresses about four times as great as the 
maximum stress given by Eq. (8.1-2) occur near the points of loading and support 
†Note that the transverse shear stress denoted here is the shear stress due to the vertical transverse 
force, V. The maximum transverse shear stress in a beam is not necessarily the maximum shear stress 
in the beam. One needs to look at the overall state of stress in light of stress transformations. For long 
beams, the maximum shear stress is normally due to the maximum fiber stress, and, using Eq. (2.3-25), 
the maximum shear stress is τmax = ½ σmax = ½ M/S. For this reason, we will denote the maximum 
transverse shear stress in a beam as (
)
max
.

(Ref. 2), but experience shows that this variation may be ignored and design based on 
the average value as determined by Eq. (8.1-2). 
For some sections the greatest horizontal shear stress at a given point occurs, not on 
a horizontal plane, but on an inclined longitudinal plane which cuts the section so as to 
make b a minimum. Thus, for a circular tube or pipe the greatest horizontal shear stress 
at any point occurs on a radial plane; the corresponding shear stress in the plane of the 
section is not vertical but tangential, and in computing τ by Eq. (8.1-2) b should be taken 
as twice the thickness of the tube instead of the net horizontal breadth of the member. (See 
Table 9.2, case 20 for an example of where this shear stress in a tube is of importance.) 
In an I-, T-, or box section there is a horizontal shear stress on any vertical longitu-
dinal plane through the flange, and this stress is usually a maximum at the juncture of 
flange and web. It may be calculated by Eq. (8.1-2), taking ′
A  as the area outside of the 
vertical plane (for outstanding flanges) or between the vertical plane and the center of 
the beam section (for box girders), and b as the flange thickness (see the solution to 
Example lb). The other terms have the same meanings as explained previously. 
Shear stresses are not often of controlling importance except in wood or metal beams 
that have thin webs or a small span/depth ratio. For beams that conform to the assump-
tions stated previously, strength will practically always be governed by fiber stress. 
Change in Projected Length due to Bending

inal length and the horizontal projection of the elastic curve, is given by

By means of these equations the actual relative horizontal displacement of points on the 
upper or lower surface of the beam can be predicted and the necessary allowances 
made in the design of rocker bearings, clearance for the corners, etc. 
Tabulated Formulas
Table 8.1 gives formulas for the reactions, moments, slopes and deflections at each end 
of single-span beams supported and loaded in various ways. The table also gives for-
mulas for the vertical shears, bending moments, slopes, and deflections at any distance 
x from the left end of the span. 
In these formulas, the unit step function is used by itself and in combination with 
ordinary functions. 
The unit step function is denoted by 〈- 〉
x

is defined as follows: If x

In addition to the usual concentrated vertical loads, concentrated couples, and dis-
tributed loads, Table 8.1 also presents cases where the loading is essentially a develop-
ment of reactions due to deformations created within the span. These cases include the 
concentrated angular displacement, concentrated transverse deflection, and linear tem-
perature differential across the beam from top to bottom. In all three cases it can be assumed 
that initially the beam was deformed but free of stress and then is forced to conform to the end 
conditions. (In many cases no forces are created, and the formulas give only the deformed 
shape.) 
Hetényi (Ref. 29) discusses in detail the Maclaurin series form of the equations used 
in this article and suggests (Ref. 53) that the deformation type of loading might be use-
ful in solving beam problems. Thomson (Ref. 65) describes the use of the unit step func-
tion in the determination of beam deflections. By superposition, the formulas can be 
made to apply to almost any type of loading and support. The use of the tabulated and 
fundamental formulas given in this article is illustrated in the following examples: 
example 1  For a beam supported and loaded as shown in Fig. 8.2, it is required to determine the 
maximum tensile stress, maximum shear stress, and maximum compressive stress, assuming, (a) that 
the beam is made of wood with section as shown in Fig. 8.2(a); (b) that the beam is made of wood with 
section as shown in Fig. 8.2(b); and (c) that the beam is a 4-in, 7.7-lb steel I-beam, not shown. 
Solution  By using the equations of equilibrium (Sec. 4.1), the left and right reactions are found to be 
900 and 1500 lb, respectively. The shear and moment equations are therefore

These equations are plotted, giving the shear and moment diagrams shown in Fig. 8.2. The 
maximum positive moment evidently occurs between the supports; the exact location is found by 
setting the first shear equation equal to zero and solving for x, which gives x = 75 in. Substitution of 
this value of x in the first moment equation gives M = 33,750 lb-in. The maximum negative moment 
occurs at the right support where the shear diagram again passes through zero and is 9600 lb-in. 
The results obtained so far are independent of the cross section of the beam. The stresses will now 
be calculated for each of the sections (a), (b), and (c).

	 Although this method of calculating τ (where the shear force is assumed to be carried entirely 
by the web) is only approximate, it is usually sufficiently accurate to show whether or not this 
shear stress is important. If it indicates that this shear stress may govern, then the stress at the 
neutral axis may be calculated by Eq. (8.1-2). For standard I-beams, the allowable vertical shear 
is given by the structural-steel handbooks, making computation unnecessary. 
Example 2  The beam shown in Fig. 8.3 has a rectangular section 2 in wide and 4 in deep and is made 
of spruce, where E = 1,300,000 lb/in2. It is required to determine the deflection of the left end. 
Solution  The solution will be effected first by superposition, using the formulas of Table 8.1. The 
deflection y of the left end is the sum of the deflection y1 produced by the distributed load and the 
deflection y2 produced by the concentrated load. Each of these is computed independently of the other 
and added using superposition. Thus

The solution of this problem can also be effected readily by using Eq. (8.1-6). The reaction at the 
left support due to the actual loads is 343 lb and the reaction due to a unit load acting down at the left 
support is 1.286. If x is measured from the extreme left end of the beam,

(Here the plus sign means that y is in the direction of the assumed unit load, i.e., downward.) 
This second solution involves much more labor than the first, and the calculations must be carried 
out with great accuracy to avoid the possibility of making a large error in the final result. 
Example 3  A cast iron beam is simply supported at the left end and fixed at the right end on a span of 
100 cm. The cross section is 4 cm wide and 6 cm deep (I = 72 cm4). The modulus of elasticity of 
cast iron is 107 N/cm2, and the coefficient of expansion is 0.000012 cm/cm/°C. It is desired to 
determine the locations and magnitudes of the maximum vertical deflection and the maximum 
bending stress in the beam. The loading consists of a uniformly increasing distributed load starting 
at 0 at 40 cm from the left end and increasing to 200 N/cm at the right end. In addition, the beam, 
which was originally 20°C, is heated to 50°C on the top and 100°C on the bottom with the temperature 
assumed to vary linearly from top to bottom.
Solution  Superimposing cases 2c and 6c of Table 8.1, the following reactions are determined. (Note: 
For case 2c, wa = 0, a = 40 cm, wl = 200 N/cm, and l = 100 cm; for case 6c, T1 = 50°C, T2 = 100°C, 
γ = 0.000012 cm/cm/°C, t = 6 cm, and a = 0.)

(a shortening)  
In addition to the shortening of the neutral surface, the lower edge of the left end moves to the left by 
an amount qAc or 0.00632(3) = 0.01896 cm. Similarly, the lower edge of the right end moves to the right 
by an amount qBc or 0.00826(3) = 0.02478 cm. Evaluating the motion of the lower edges in this manner 
is equivalent to solving Eq. (8.1-15) for the total strain in the lower fibers of the beam.
The total relative motion of the lower edges of the end sections is therefore a moving apart by an 
amount 0.01896 + 0.02478 - 0.00135 = 0.0424 cm.

8.2  Composite Beams and Bimetallic Strips
Beams that are constructed of more than one material can be treated by using an equiv-
alent width technique if the maximum stresses in each of the several materials remain 
within the proportional limit. An equivalent cross section is developed in which the 
width of each component parallel to the principal axis of bending is increased in the 
same proportion that the modulus of elasticity of that component makes with the mod-
ulus of the assumed material of the equivalent beam.
Example  The beam cross section shown in Fig. 8.4(a) is composed of three portions of equal width and 
depth. The top portion is made of aluminum for which EA =
⋅
10 106 lb/in2; the center is made of brass 
for which EB =
⋅
15 106 lb/in2; and the bottom is made of steel for which ES =
⋅
30 106 lb/in2. Figure 8.4(b) 
shows the equivalent cross section, which is assumed to be made of aluminum. For this equivalent cross 
section the centroid must be located and the moment of inertia determined for the centroidal axis.

A flexure stress computed by σ = Mc Ix
/
 will give a stress in the equivalent beam which can thereby 
be converted into the stress in the actual composite beam by multiplying by the modulus ratio. If a 
bending moment of 300,000 lb-in were applied to a beam with the cross section shown, the stress at 
the top surface of the equivalent beam would be σ = 300,000(6 − 2.27)/89.5, or 12,500 lb/in2. Since the 
material at the top is the same in both the actual and equivalent beams, this is also the maximum stress 
in the aluminum portion of the actual beam. The stress at the bottom of the equivalent beam would 
be σ = 300,000(2.27)/89.5 = 7620 lb/in2. Multiplying this stress by the modulus ratio, the actual stress 
at the bottom of the steel portion of the beam would be σ = 7620(30/10) = 22,900 lb/in2.
Bimetallic strips are widely used in instruments to sense or control temperatures. 
The following formula gives the equivalent properties of the strip for which the cross

All the formulas in Table 8.1, cases 1–5, can be applied to the bimetallic beam by 
using this equivalent value of EI. Since a bimetallic strip is designed to deform when its 
temperature differs from To  , the temperature at which the strip is straight, Table 8.1, 
case 6, can be used to solve for reaction forces and moments as well as deformations of 
the bimetallic strip under a uniform temperature T. To do this, the term γ(

 and EI is replaced by the equivalent

After the moments and deformations have been determined, the flexure stresses 
can be computed. The stresses due to the bending moments caused by the restraints 
and any applied loads are given by the following expressions:

If there are no restraints imposed, the distortion of a bimetallic strip due to a tempera-
ture change is accompanied by flexure stresses in the two materials. This differs from a 
beam made of a single material which deforms free of stress when subjected to a linear 
temperature variation through the thickness if there are no restraints. Therefore, the 
following stresses must be added algebraically to the stresses caused by the bending 
moments, if any:

Example  A bimetallic strip is made by bonding a piece of titanium alloy ¼ in wide by 0.030 in thick 
to a piece of stainless steel ¼ in wide by 0.060 in thick. For titanium, E = 17 ⋅ 106 lb/in2 and γ = 5.7 ⋅ 10−6 
in/in/°F; for stainless steel, E = 28 ⋅ 106 lb/in2 and γ = 9.6 ⋅ 10−6 in/in/°F. It is desired to find the length 
of bimetal required to develop a reaction force of 5 oz at a simply supported left end when the right 
end is fixed and the temperature is raised 50°F; also the maximum stresses must be determined.
Solution  First find the value of K1 from Eq. (8.2-2) and then evaluate the equivalent stiffness from 
Eq. (8.2-1):

8.3  Three-Moment Equation
The three-moment equation, which expresses the relationship between the bending 
moments found at three consecutive supports in a continuous beam, can be readily 
derived for any loading shown in Table 8.1. This is accomplished by taking any two 
consecutive spans and evaluating the slope for each span at the end where the two 
spans join. These slopes, which are expressed in terms of the three moments and the 
loads on the spans, are then equated and the equation reduced to its usual form.
Example  Consider two contiguous spans loaded as shown in Fig. 8.6. In addition to the loading 
shown, it is known that the left end of span 1 had settled an amount y2 − y1 relative to the right end 
of the span, and similarly that the left end of span 2 has settled an amount y3 − y2 relative to the right 
end. (Note that y1  , y2  , and y3 are considered positive upward as usual.) The individual spans with 
their loadings are shown in Fig. 8.7(a,b). Determine the relationship between the applied loads and 
the moment at the intermediate support.
Solution  Using cases 2e and 3e from Table 8.1 and noting the relative deflections mentioned above, 
the expression for the slope at the right end of span 1 is

If M1 and M3 are known, this expression can be solved for M2; if not, similar expressions for the adjacent 
spans must be written and the set of equations solved for the moments.
The three-moment equation can also be applied to beams carrying axial tension or com-
pression in addition to transverse loading. The procedure is exactly the same as that 
described above except the slope formulas to be used are those given in Tables 8.8 
and 8.9.
8.4  Rigid Frames
By superposition and the matching of slopes and deflections, the formulas in Table 8.1 
can be used to solve for the indeterminate reactions in rigid frames or to determine the 
deformations where the support conditions permit such deformations to take place. 
The term rigid in this section simply means that any deformations are small enough to 
have negligible effect on bending moments.
In Table 8.2 formulas are given for the indeterminate reactions and end deforma-
tions for rigid frames consisting of three members. Only in-plane deformations and 
only those due to bending moments have been included in the expressions found in this 
table. Since deformations due to transverse shear and axial loading are not included, 
the results are limited to those frames made up of members which are long in propor-
tion to their depths (see assumptions 6–8 in Sec. 8.1). Each member must be straight and 
of uniform cross section having a principal axis lying in the plane of the frame. The 
elastic stability of the frame, either in the plane of the frame or out of this plane, has not 
been treated in developing Table 8.2. The effects of axial load on the bending deforma-
tions, as documented in Tables 8.7‑8.9, have not been considered. A final check on a 
solution must verify that indeed these effects can be neglected. Very extensive compila-
tions of formulas for rigid frames are available, notably those of Kleinlogel (Ref. 56) and 
Leontovich (Ref. 57).
While Table 8.2 is obviously designed for frames with three members where the 
vertical members both lie on the same side of the horizontal member, its use is not 
limited to this configuration. One can set the lengths of either of the vertical members, 
members 1 and 2, equal to zero and solve for reactions and deformations of two-member 
frames. The length of the horizontal member, member 3, should not be set to zero for 
two reasons: (1) It does not generally represent a real problem; and (2) the lengths of 
members 1 and 2 are assumed not to change, and this adds a restraint to member 3 that 
would force it to have zero slope if its length was very short. Another very useful 
application of the expressions in Table 8.2 is to apply them to frames where one of the 
two vertical members lies on the opposite side of the horizontal member. Instead of 
forming a U-shape in the side view, it forms a Z-shape. To do this one must change the 
signs of three variables associated with the reversed member: (1) the sign of the length 
of the reversed member, (2) the sign of the distance a which locates any load on the 
reversed member, and (3) the sign of the product EI of the reversed member. All the 
reactions and end-point deflections retain their directions as given in the figures in 
Table 8.2; that is, if member 1 is reversed and extends upward from the left end of 
member 3, HA now acts at the upper end of member 1 and is positive to the left as is 
δHA. Example 3 illustrates this application as well as showing how the results of using 
Tables 8.1 and 8.2 together can be used to determine the deformations anywhere in a 
given frame.

C h a p t e r  E i g h t
When the number of members is large, as in a framed building, a relaxation method 
such as moment distribution might be used or a digital computer could be programmed 
to solve the large number of equations. In all rigid frames, corner or knee design is 
important; much information and experimental data relating to this problem are to be 
found in the reports published by the Fritz Engineering Laboratories of Lehigh Univer-
sity. The frames given in Table 8.2 are assumed to have rigid corners; however, correc-
tions can be made easily once the rigidity of a given corner design is known by making 
use of the concentrated angular displacement loading with the displacement positioned 
at the corner. This application is illustrated in Example 2.
Example 1  The frame shown in Fig. 8.8(a) is fixed at the lower end of the right-hand member and 
guided at the lower end of the left-hand member in such a way as to prevent any rotation of this end 
but permitting horizontal motion if any is produced by the loading. The configuration could represent 
the upper half of the frame shown in Fig. 8.8(b); for this frame the material properties and physical 
dimensions are given as l1 = 40 in, l2 = 20 in, I3 = 15 in, E1 = E2 = E3 = 30 ⋅ 106 lb/in2, I1 = 8 in4, I2 = 10 in4, 
and I3 = 4 in4. In addition to the load P of 1000 lb, the frame has been subjected to a temperature rise 
of 50°F since it was assembled in a stress-free condition. The coefficient of expansion of the material 
used in all three portions is 0.0000065 in/in/°F.
Solution  An examination of Table 8.2 shows the required end or support conditions in case 7 with 
the loading cases f and q listed under case 5. For cases 5–12 the frame constants are evaluated as

Figure 8.9 shows the moment diagram for the entire frame.
Example 2  If the joint at the top of the left vertical member in Example 1 had not been rigid but instead 
had been found to be deformable by 10−7 rad for every inch-pound of bending moment applied to it, 
the solution can be modified as follows.
Figure 8.9  (units are in lb-in)

Solution  The bending moment as the corner in question would be given by Ma − 28(1000), and so the 
corner rotation would be 10−7(Ma − 28,000) rad in a direction opposite to that shown by qo in case 5a. 
Note that the position of qo is at the corner, and so A would be 40 in. Therefore, the following load 
terms due to the corner deformation can be added to the previously determined load terms:

Example 3  Find the reactions and deformations at the four positions A to D in the pinned-end frame 
shown in Fig. 8.10. All lengths are given in millimeters, Mo = 2000 N-mm, and all members are made 
of aluminum for which E = 7(104)N/mm2 with a constant cross section for which I = 100 mm4.

Solution  Case 1h of Table 8.2 covers this combination of loading and end supports, if, due to the 
upward reach of member 1, appropriate negative values are used. The need for negative values is 
described in the introduction to Sec. 8.4. Substitute the following material properties and physical 
dimensions into case 1h: l1 = −100 mm, l2 = 150 mm, l3 = 75 mm, a = −(100 − 40) = −60 mm, E1I1 = −7(106) 
N-mm2, and E2I2 = E3I3 = 7(106) N-mm2. Using these data gives the frame and load constants as

To obtain the angle ψ A = 0.01533 rad at position A, member 1 must be given an additional rigid-body 
clockwise rotation of 0.01533 − 0.001325 = 0.01401 rad. This rigid-body motion moves position C to the 
left a distance of 1.401 mm and makes the slope at position C equal to 0.007221 − 0.01401 = −0.006784

No rigid-body rotation is necessary for member 3 since the left end has the same slope as the lower

To match the slope at the right end of member 3, a rigid-body counterclockwise rotation of 0.005013 + 
0.00432 = 0.009337 rad must be given to member 2. This creates a slope ψB = 0.009337 + 0.002162 = 
0.01150 rad counterclock-wise and a horizontal deflection at the top end of 0.009337(150) = 1.401 mm 
to the left. This matches the horizontal deflection of the lower end of member 1 as a final check on 
the calculations.
To verify that the effect of axial load on the bending deformations of the members is negligible, 
the Euler load on the longest member is found to be more than 100 times the actual load. Using the 
formulas from Table 8.8 would not produce significantly different results from those in Table 8.1.
8.5  Beams on Elastic Foundations
There are cases in which beams are supported on foundations which develop essen-
tially continuous reactions that are proportional at each position along the beam to the 
deflection of the beam at that position. This is the reason for the name elastic foundation. 
Solutions are available (Refs. 41 and 42) which consider that the foundation transmits 
shear forces within the foundation such that the reaction force is not directly propor-
tional to the deflection at a given location but instead is proportional to a function of the 
deflections near the given location; these solutions are much more difficult to use and 
are not justified in many cases since the linearity of most foundations is open to question 
anyway.
It is not necessary, in fact, that a foundation be continuous. If a discontinuous foun-
dation, such as is encountered in the support provided a rail by the cross ties, is found 
to have at least three concentrated reaction forces in every half-wavelength of the 
deflected beam, then the solutions provided in this section are adequate.
Table 8.5 provides formulas for the reactions and deflections at the left end of a 
finite-length beam on an elastic foundation as well as formulas for the shear, moment, 
slope, and deflection at any point x along the length. The format used in presenting the 
formulas is designed to facilitate programming for use on a digital computer or pro-
grammable calculator.
In theory the equations in Table 8.5 are correct for any finite-length beam or for any 
finite foundation modulus, but for practical purposes they should not be used when βl 
exceeds a value of 6 because the roundoff errors that are created where two very nearly 
equal large numbers are subtracted will make the accuracy of the answer questionable. 
For this reason, Table 8.6 has been provided. Table 8.6 contains formulas for semi- 
infinite- and infinite-length beams on elastic foundations. These formulas are of a much 
simpler form since the far end of the beam is assumed to be far enough away so as to 
have no effect on the response of the left end to the loading. If βl > 6 and the load is 
nearer the left end, this is the case.
Hetényi (Ref. 53) discusses this problem of a beam supported on an elastic founda-
tion extensively and shows how the solutions can be adapted to other elements such as 

B e a m s ;  F l e x u r e  o f  S t r a i g h t  B a r s 	
175
hollow cylinders. Hetényi (Ref. 51) has also developed a series solution for beams 
supported on elastic foundations in which the stiffness parameters of the beam and 
foundation are not incorporated in the arguments of trigonometric or hyperbolic func-
tions. He gives tables of coefficients derived for specific boundary conditions from 
which deformation, moments, or shears can be found at any specific point along the 
beam. Any degree of accuracy can be obtained by using enough terms in the series.
Tables of numerical values, Tables 8.3 and 8.4, are provided to assist in the solution 
of the formulas in Table 8.5. Interpolation is possible for values that are included but 
should be used with caution if it is noted that differences of large and nearly equal num-
bers are being encountered. A far better method of interpolation for a beam with a single 
load is to solve the problem twice. For the first solution move the load to the left until 
β(
)
l
a
-
 is a value found in Table 8.3, and for the second solution move the load similarly 
to the right. A linear interpolation from these solutions should be very accurate.
Presenting the formulas for end reactions and displacements in Table 8.5 in terms 
of the constants Ci and Cai is advantageous since it permits one to solve directly for 
loads anywhere on the span. If the loads are at the left end such that Ci = Cai  , then the 
formulas can be presented in a simpler form as is done in Ref. 6 of Chap. 13 for

Example 1  A 6-in, 12.5-lb I-beam 20 ft long is used as a rail for an overhead crane and is in turn being 
supported every 2 ft of its length by being bolted to the bottom of a 5-in, 10-lb I-beam at midlength. 
The supporting beams are each 21.5 ft long and are considered to be simply supported at the ends. 
This is a case of a discontinuous foundation being analyzed as a continuous foundation. It is desired 
to determine the maximum bending stresses in the 6-in beam as well as in the supporting beams when 
a load of 1 ton is supported at one end of the crane.
Solution  The spring constant for each supporting beam is 48EI/l3, or (48)(30 ⋅ 106)(12.1)/(21.5 ⋅ 12)3 = 
1013 lb/in. If this is assumed to be distributed over a 2-ft length of the rail, the equivalent value of boko 
is 1.013/24 = 42.2 lb/in per inch of deflection. Therefore,

An examination of the deflection of a beam on an elastic foundation shows that it varies cyclicly in 
amplitude with the sine and cosine of βx. A half-wavelength of this cyclic variation would occur 
over a span l1  , where β
π
l1 =
, or l1 = π/0.01127 = 279 in. There is no question about there being at least 
three supporting forces over this length, and so the use of the solution for a continuous foundation 
is entirely adequate.

Since βl is less than 6, Table 8.5 will be used. Refer to case 1 where both ends are free. It must be 
pointed out that a simple support refers to a reaction force, developed by a support other than the 
foundation, which is large enough to prevent any vertical deflection of the end of the beam. From 
the table we find that RA = 0 and MA = 0; and since the load is at the left end, a = 0. When a = 0, the Ca 
terms are equal to the C terms, and so the four terms C1 , C2  , C3 , and C4 are calculated:

π/4 (0.01127) = 69.7 in, which would be the location of the maximum moment if the beam were 
infinitely long (see Table 8.6). This procedure reveals that the maximum moment occurs at x = 66.5 
in and has a value of –55,400 lb-in.
The maximum stress in the 6-in I-beam is therefore 55,400(3)/21.8 = 7620 lb/in2. The maximum 
stress in the supporting 5-in I-beams is found at the midspan of the beam directly above the load. 
The deflection of this beam is known to be 1.092 in, and the spring constant is 1013 lb/in, so that the 
center load on the beam is 1.092(1013) = 1107 lb. Therefore, the maximum bending moment is Pl/4 = 
1107(21.5)(12)/4 = 71,400 lb-in and the maximum stress is 71,400(2.5)/12.1 = 14,780 lb/in2.
Example 2  If the 6-in I-beam in Example 1 had been much longer but supported in the same 
manner, Table 8.6 could have been used. Case 8 reveals that for an end load the end deflection is

 –1.070 in and the maximum moment would have 
equaled –0.3225W/β = –0.3225(2000)/0.01127 = –57,200 in-lb at 69.7 in from the left end. We should not 
construe from this example that increasing the length will always increase the stresses; if the load had 
been placed elsewhere on the span, the longer beam could have had the lower maximum stress.

Example 3  An aluminum alloy beam 3 in wide, 2 in deep, and 60 in long is manufactured with an initial 
concentrated angular deformation of 0.02 rad at midlength; this initial shape is shown in Fig. 8.11(a). In 
use, the beam is placed on an elastic foundation which develops 500 lb/in2 vertical upward pressure for 
every 1 in it is depressed. The beam is loaded by two concentrated loads of 4000 lb each and a uniformly 
distributed load of 80 lb/in over the portion between the concentrated loads. The loading is shown in 
Fig. 8.11(b). It is desired to determine the maximum bending stress in the aluminum beam.

An examination of Table 8.5 shows the loading conditions covered by the superposition of three cases 
in which both ends are free: case 1 used twice with W1 = 4000 lb and a1 = 15 in, and W2 = 4000 lb and 
a2 = 45 in; case 2 used twice with w3 = 80 lb/in and a3 = 15 in, and w4 = –80 lb/in and a4 = 45 in; case 5 
used once with qo = 0.02 and a = 30 in.
The loads and deformations at the left end are now evaluated by summing the values for the 
five different loads, which is done in the order in which the loads are mentioned. But before actually 
summing the end values, a set of constants involving the load positions must be determined for each 
case. For case 1, load 1:

8.6  Deformation Due to the Elasticity of Fixed Supports
The formulas in Tables 8.1, 8.2, 8.5, 8.6, and 8.8–8.10 that apply to those cases where 
fixed or guided end supports are specified are based on the assumption that the sup-
port is rigid and holds the fixed or guided end truly horizontal or vertical. The slight 
deformation that actually occurs at the support permits the beam to assume there a 
slope ∆q, which for the conditions represented in Fig. 8.12, that is, a beam integral with 
a semi-infinite supporting foundation, is given by
 ∆q

Here M is the bending moment per unit width and V is the shear force per unit width 
of the beam at the support; E is the modulus of elasticity, and v is Poisson’s ratio for the 
foundation material; and h1 = h + 1.5r (Ref. 54). The effect of this deformation is to 
increase the deflections of the beam. For a cantilever, this increase is simply x ∆q, but for 
other support conditions the concept of the externally created angular deformation 
may be utilized (see Example 2 on page 171).
For the effect of many moment-loaded cantilever beams spaced closely one above 
the next, see Ref. 67.

8.7  Beams under Simultaneous Axial and Transverse Loading
Under certain conditions a beam may be subjected to axial tension or compression in 
addition to the transverse loads. Axial tension tends to straighten the beam and thus 
reduce the bending moments produced by the transverse loads, but axial compression 
has the opposite effect and may greatly increase the maximum bending moment and 
deflection and obviously must be less than the critical or buckling load. See Chap. 15. In 
either case a solution cannot be effected by simple superposition but must be arrived at 
by methods that take into account the change in deflection produced by the axial load.
For any condition of loading, the maximum normal stress in an extreme fiber is 
given by
	
 σmax =
±
P
A
Mc
I  	
(8.7-1)
where P is the axial load (positive if tensile and negative if compressive), A is the cross-
sectional area of the beam, I/c is the section modulus, and M is the maximum bending 
moment due to the combined effect of axial and transverse loads. (Use the plus sign if M 
causes tension at the point in question and the minus sign if M causes compression.)
It is the determination of M that offers difficulty. For some cases, especially if P is 
small or tensile, it is permissible to ignore the small additional moment caused by P and 
to take M equal to 
′
M , the bending moment due to transverse loads only. Approximate 
formulas of the type (Ref. 33)

where the primed values refer to the laterally loaded beam without the axial load and can 
be evaluated from expressions found in Table 8.1. For those cases listed where the reac-
tions are statically indeterminate, the reaction coefficients given will enable the remaining 
reactions to be evaluated by applying the principles of static equilibrium. The given 
values of CP are exact, based on the assumption that deflections due to transverse shear 
are negligible. This same assumption was used in developing the equations for transverse 
shear, bending moment, slope, and deflection shown in Tables 8.8 and 8.9.
Figure. 8.12

C h a p t e r  E i g h t
Table 8.8 lists the general equations just mentioned as well as boundary values and 
selected maximum values for the case of axial compressive loading plus transverse 
loading. Since, in general, axial tension is a less critical condition, where deflections, 
slopes, and moments are usually reduced by the axial load, Table 8.9 is much more 
compact and gives only the general equations and the left-end boundary values.
Although the principle of superposition does not apply to the problem considered here, 
this modification of the principle can be used: the moment (or deflection) for a combination 
of transverse loads can be found by adding the moments (or deflections) for each transverse 
load combined with the entire axial load. Thus a beam supported at the ends and subjected 
to a uniform load, a center load, and an axial compression would have a maximum bending 
moment (or deflection) given by the sum of the maximum moments (or deflections) for 
Table 8.8, cases 1e and 2e, the end load being included once for each transverse load.
A problem closely related to the beam under combined axial and lateral loading 
occurs when the ends of a beam are axially restrained from motion along the axis of the 
beam (held) and a lateral load is applied. A solution is effected by equating the increase in 
length of the neutral surface of the beam Pl/AE to the decrease in length due to the curva-
ture of the neutral surface 1 2

∫q dx [Eq. (8.1-14)]. In general, solving the resulting equa-
tion for P is difficult owing to the presence of the hyperbolic functions and the several 
powers of the load P in the equation. If the beam is long, slender, and heavily loaded, this 
will be necessary for good accuracy; but if the deflections are small, the deflection curve 
can be approximated with a sine or cosine curve, obtaining the results given in Table 8.10. 
The following examples will illustrate the use of the formulas in Tables 8.7-8.10:
Example 1  A 4-in, 7.7-lb steel I-beam 20 ft long is simply supported at both ends and simultaneously 
subjected to a transverse load of 50 lb/ft (including its own weight), a concentrated lateral load of 600 lb 
acting vertically downward at a position 8 ft from the left end, and an axial compression of 3000 lb. It 
is required to determine the maximum fiber stress and the deflection at midlength.
Solution  Here P = 3000 lb; l = 240 in; I = 6 in4; I/c = 3 in3; A = 2.21 in2; wa = wl = 50/12 = 4.17 lb/in; and

(b)	 From Table 8.7(b) (simply supported ends), coefficients are given for concentrated loads at l/4 
and l/2. Plotting curves of the coefficients versus kl and using linear interpolation to correct for 
a = 0.4l give a value of CP = 1.112 for the midlength deflection and 1.083 for the moment under 
the load. Similarly, for a uniform load on the entire span (a = 0), the values of CP are found to 
be 1.111 for the midlength deflection and 1.115 for the moment at midlength. If it is assumed 
that this last coefficient is also satisfactory for the moment at x = 0.4l, the following deflections

The ease with which the coefficients CP can be obtained from Tables 8.7(a–d) makes this a very 
desirable way to solve problems of axially loaded beams. Some caution must be observed, however, 
when interpolating for the position of the load. For example, the concentrated moment in Tables 8.7c 
and 8.7d shows a large variation in CP for the end moments when the load position is changed from 
0.25 to 0.50, especially under axial tension. Note that there are some cases in which CP either changes 
sign or increases and then decreases when kl is increased; in these cases the loading produces both 
positive and negative moments and deflections in the span.
Example 2  A solid round brass bar 1 cm in diameter and 120 cm long is rigidly fixed at both ends 
by supports assumed to be sufficiently rigid to preclude any relative horizontal motion of the two 
supports. If this bar is subjected to a transverse center load of 300 N at midlength, what is the center 
deflection and what is the maximum tensile stress in the bar?

182	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
Solution   Here P is an unknown tensile load; W = 300 N and a = 60 cm; l = 120 cm; A = 0.785 cm2, I = 
0.0491 cm4; and E = 10 ⋅ 106 N/cm2. (This situation is described in Table 8.10, case 2.) The first equation 
is solved for ymax:

This compares favorably with the value ymax = 1.57 cm obtained from the equation which was based 
on the assumption of a cosine curve for the deflection.
An alternative to working with the large numerical values of the hyperbolic sines and cosines as 
shown in the preceding calculations would be to simplify the equations for this case where the load 

B e a m s ;  F l e x u r e  o f  S t r a i g h t  B a r s 	
183
is at the center by using the double-angle identities for hyperbolic functions. If this is done here, the

Using these expressions gives RA = 150 N, MA = −1800 N-cm, and yl/2 = −1.63 cm. Table 8.6 for axial 
compression gives the formulas for these special cases, but when the lateral loads are not placed at 
midlength or any of the other common locations, a desk calculator or digital computer must be used. If 
tables of hyperbolic functions are employed, it should be kept in mind that adequate solutions can be 
made using values of kl close to the desired values if such values are given in the table and the desired 
ones are not. For example, if the values for the arguments 9.86 and 4.93 are not available but values 
for 10 and 5 are (note that it is necessary to maintain the correct ratio a/l ), these values could be used 
with no noticeable change in the results. Finally, an energy approach, using Rayleigh’s technique, is 
outlined in Chap. 6, Sec. 13, of Ref. 72. The method works well with simple, axially constrained, and 
unconstrained beams.
8.8  Beams of Variable Section
Stress
For a beam whose cross section changes gradually, Eqs. (8.1-1), (8.1-4), and (8.1-10)–
(8.1-12) apply with sufficient accuracy; Eqs. (8.1-3) and (8.1-5)-(8.1-7) apply if I is treated 
as a variable, as in the examples that follow. All the formulas given in Table 8.1 for vertical 
shear and bending moments in statically determinate beams apply, but the formulas given 
for statically indeterminate beams and for deflection and slope are inapplicable to beams 
of nonuniform section unless the section varies in such a way that I is constant.
Accurate analysis (Ref. 3) shows that in an end-loaded cantilever beam of rectangu-
lar section which is symmetrically tapered in the plane of bending, the maximum fiber 
stress is somewhat less than is indicated by Eq. (8.1-12), the error amounting to about 5% 
for a surface slope of 15° (wedge angle 30°) and about 10% for a surface slope of 20°. See 
also Prob. 2.35 in Ref. 66. The maximum horizontal and vertical shear stress is shown to 
occur at the upper and lower surfaces instead of at the neutral axis and to be approxi-
mately three times as great as the average shear stress on the section for slopes up to 20°. 
It is very doubtful, however, if this shear stress is often critical even in wood beams, 
although it may possibly start failure in short, heavily reinforced concrete beams 
that are deepened or “haunched” at the ends. Such a failure, if observed, would prob-
ably be ascribed to compression since it would occur at a point of high compressive 
stress. It is also conceivable, of course, that this shear stress might be of importance in 
certain metal parts subject to repeated stress.
Abrupt changes in the section of a beam cause high local stresses, the effect of which 
is taken into account by using the proper factor of stress concentration (Sec. 3.10 and 
Table 17.1).
Deflection
Determining deflections or statically indeterminate reactions for beams of variable sec-
tion can be considered in two categories: where the beam has a continuously varying 
cross section from one end to the other, and where the cross section varies in a stepwise 
fashion.

184	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
Considering the first category, where the section varies continuously, we sometimes 
find a variation where Eq. (8.1-5) can be integrated directly, with the moment of inertia 
treated as a variable. This has been accomplished in Ref. 20 for tapered beams of circu-
lar section, but using the expressions presented, one must carry more than the usual 
number of digits to get accurate results. In most instances, however, this is not easy, if 
possible, and a more productive approach is to integrate Eq. (8.1-6) numerically using 
small incremental lengths ∆x. This has been done for a limited number of cases, and the 
results are tabulated in Tables 8.11(a)–(d).
These tables give coefficients by which the stated reaction forces or moments or the 
stated deformations for uniform beams, as given in Table 8.1, must be multiplied to 
obtain the comparable reactions or deformations for the tapered beams. The coefficients 
are dependent upon the ratio of the moment of inertia at the right end of the beam IB to 
the moment of inertia at the left end IA  , assuming that the uniform beam has a moment 
of inertia IA . The coefficients are also dependent upon the manner of variation between 
the two end values. This variation is of the form I

1  Thus if the beam is uniform, n = 0; if the width 
of a rectangular cross section varies linearly, n = 1; if the width of a rectangular cross 
section varies parabolically, n = 2; if the depth of a rectangular cross section varies lin-
early, n = 3; and if the lateral dimensions of any cross section vary linearly and propor-
tionately, n = 4. Beams having similar variations in cross section can be analyzed 
approximately by comparing the given variations to those found in Table 8.11.
Coefficients are given for only a few values of a/l, so it is not desirable to interpolate 
to determine coefficients for other values of a/l. Instead it is advisable to determine the 
corrected deformations or reactions with the loads at the tabulated values of a/l and 
then interpolate. This allows the use of additional known values as shown in the second 
example below. For beams with symmetric end conditions, such as both ends fixed or 
both ends simply supported, the data given for any value of a l
/ < 0 5
.  can be used twice 
by reversing the beam end for end.
Example 1  A tapered beam 30 in long with a depth varying linearly from 2 in at the left end to 4 in at 
the right end and with a constant width of 1.5 in is fixed on the right end and simply supported on 
the left end. A concentrated clockwise couple of 5000 lb-in is applied at midlength and it is desired to 
know the maximum bending stress in the beam.
Solution  First determine the left-end reaction force for a uniform cross section. From Table 8.1, case 
3c, the left reaction is

In Table 8.11(c) for n = 3, IB/IA = 8; and for case 3c with the loading at l/2, the coefficient is listed as 
0.906. Therefore, the left-end reaction is −187.5(0.906) = −170 lb.
The maximum negative moment will occur just left of midlength and will equal −170(15) = 
−2550 lb-in. The maximum positive moment will occur just right of midlength and will equal −2550 + 
5000 = 2450 lb-in. At midlength the moment of inertia I = 1.5(33)/12 = 3.37 in4, and so the maximum stress 
is given by σ =

 2550(1.5)/3.37 = 1135 lb/in2 just left of midlength.

Example 2  A machine part is an 800-mm-long straight beam with a variable wide-flange cross section. 
The single central web has a constant thickness of 1.5 mm but a linearly varying depth from 6 mm 
at the left end A to 10 mm at the right end B. The web and flanges are welded together continuously 
over the entire length and are also welded to supporting structures at each end to provide fixed ends. 
A concentrated lateral load of 100 N acts normal to the central axis of the beam parallel to the web at a 
distance of 300 mm from the left end. The maximum bending stress and the deflection under the load 
are desired. The modulus of elasticity is 70GPa, or 70,000 N/mm2.
Solution  First determine the left-end reaction force and moment for a beam of constant cross section.

Solving this last expression gives 1/n = 0.35, n = 2.86, and K = 0.689.
An examination of Tables 8.11(a–d) shows that for a fixed-ended beam with a concentrated load, 
which is case 1d in Table 8.1, values of coefficients are given only for a/l = 0.25 and 0.50. For this 
problem a/l = 0.375. Simple linear interpolation is not sufficiently accurate. However, if one imagines 
the load at a/l = 0.25 the values for RA and Ma can be found. This procedure can be repeated for 
a/l = 0.50. Two other sets of data are also available. If the load were placed at the left end, a/l = 0, 
MA = 0, RA = 100 N, and dMA/da = −100 N. If the load were placed at the right end, a/l = 1, RA = 0, 
MA = 0, and dMA/da = 0. The variations of the tabulated coefficients with IB/IA and with n do not pose 
a comparable problem since many data are available. Plotting curves for the variation with IB/IA and 
interpolating linearly between n = 2 and n = 3 for n = 2.86 give the coefficients used below to find the 
values for RA and MA at a/l = 0.25 and 0.50:

Plotting these values of RA and MA versus a/l for the four positions allows one to pick from the graphs 
at a/l = 0.375, RA = 60 N, and MA = −8800 N-mm. The use of static equilibrium now gives MB = −10,800 
N-mm and the moment at the load of 9200 N-mm. The bending stress at the left end is found to be 
the largest.

No correction coefficients for deflections are included for case ld in Table 8.11. The deflection at the 
load position can be found from the information in this table, however, if either end of the beam is

Treat the left portion of the beam as a 300-mm-long cantilever, using case 1a with an end load of 
60 N and case 3a with an end moment of 9200 N-mm. Determine the correction coefficients for a/ l = 0, 
n = 3, and the moment of inertia ratio of 288.33/556.44 = 0.518. Interpolation between data for n = 2 
and n = 3 is not justified when considering the approximations already made from plotted curves. 
Noting that all correction coefficients in Table 8.11 are unity for IB / IA = 1 and using data points for  
IB / IA = 0.25 and 0.50, the correction coefficients used below were found.

This deflection at the load can be checked by repeating the above procedure by using the right-hand 
portion of the beam. The slope of the beam at the load can also be used as a check.
Alternative Solution
The solution just presented was intended to illustrate appropriate methods of interpo-
lation with the limited load positions shown in the tables. There is also an alternative 
solution involving superposition of cases. Remove the fixity at end A and treat the 
500-mm-long right portion as a cantilever with an end load of 100 N. Use n = 3 as being 
close enough to n = 2.86 and IB /IC = 1287.7/556.4 = 2.314. Interpolate between IB/IC = 2 
and 4 to obtain from case 1a in Table 8.11(c) the correction coefficients used below to 
calculate the slope and deflection at the load.

Since the left portion is unloaded and remains straight, the end deflection and slope are

Adding the slopes and deflections from the load of 100 N to those above and equating 
each to zero to represent the fixed end gives RA = 60.3 N and MA = −8790 N-mm. This is 
a reasonable check on those values from the first solution.

The second category of determining deflections, where the cross section varies in 
steps from one uniform section to another, can be solved in several ways. Equation (8.1-5) 
can be integrated, matching slopes and deflections at the transition sections, or Eq. (8.1-6) 
can be integrated over the separate portions and summed to obtain the desired deflec-
tions. A third method utilizes the advantages of the step function and its application to 
beam deflections as given in Table 8.1. In a given portion of the span where the cross 
section is uniform it is apparent that the shape of the elastic curve will remain the same 
if the internal bending moments and the moments of inertia are increased or decreased 
in proportion. By this means, a modified moment diagram can be constructed which 
could be applied to a beam with a single constant cross section and thereby produce an 
elastic curve identical to the one produced by the actual moments and the several 
moments of inertia present in the actual span. It is also apparent that this modified 
moment diagram could be produced by adding appropriate loads to the beam. (See 
Refs. 29 and 65.) In summary, then, a new loading is constructed which will produce the 
required elastic curve, and the solution for this loading is carried out by using the for-
mulas in Table 8.1. This procedure will be illustrated by the following example:
Example  The beam shown in Fig. 8.13 has a constant depth of 4 in and a step increase in the width 
from 2 to 5 in at a point 5 ft from the left end. The left end is simply supported, and the right end is 
fixed; the loading is a uniform 200 lb/ft from x = 3 ft to the right end. Find the value of the reaction at 
the left end and the maximum stress.
Solution  For the left 5 ft, I1 = 2(43)/12 = 10.67 in4. For the right 5 ft, I2 = 5(43)/12 = 26.67 in4, or 2.5 
times I1.

The same M/I diagram shown in Fig. 8.13(e) can be produced by the loading shown in Fig. 8.14 
acting upon a beam having a constant moment of inertia I2. Note that all loads on the left portion 
simply have been increased by a factor of 2.5, while added loads at the 5-ft position reduce the effects 
of these added loads to those previously present on the right portion.
To find the left-end reaction for the beam loaded as shown in Fig. 7.14(a), use Table 8.1, case 1c, 
where W = 1.5R1 − 600 and a = 5; case 2c, where wa = wl = 500 lb/ft and a = 3 ft; case 2c, again, where wa 
= wl = −300 lb/ft and a = 5 ft; and finally case 3c, where Mo = −(7.5R1 − 600) and a = 5 ft. Summing the 
expressions for RA from these cases in the order above, we obtain

Here MA is the bending moment at A (midlength of the slot), VA is the vertical shear at 
A, I/c is the section modulus of the net beam section at B, I1 and I2 are the moments of 
inertia, and (I/c), and (I/c)2 are the section moduli of the cross sections of parts 1 and 2 
about their own central axes. M and V are positive or negative according to the usual 
convention, and x is positive when measured to the right.
The preceding formulas are derived by replacing all forces acting on the beam to the 
left of A by an equivalent couple MA and shear VA at A. The couple produces a bending 
stress given by the first term of the formula. The shear divides between parts 1 and 2 in 
proportion to their respective I’s and produces in each part an additional bending stress 
given by the second term of the formula. The stress at any other point in the cross sec-
tion can be found similarly by adding the stresses due to MA and those due to this sec-
ondary bending caused by the shear. (At the ends of the slot there is a stress 
concentration at the corners which is not taken into account here.)
The above analysis applies also to a beam with multiple slots of equal length; all 
that is necessary is to modify the term (I1 + I2). The numerator is still the I of the part in 
question and the denominator is the sum of the I’s of all the parts 1, 2, 3, etc. The formu-
las can also be used for a rigid frame consisting of beams of equal length joined at their 
ends by rigid members; thus in Fig. 8.15 parts 1 and 2 might equally well be two sepa-
rate beams joined at their ends by rigid crosspieces.
8.10  Beams of Relatively Great Depth
In beams of small span/depth ratio, the transverse shear stresses are likely to be high 
and the resulting deflection due to shear may not be negligible. For span/depth ratios 
of 3 or more, the deflection ys due to shear is found by the method of unit loads to be

In Eq. (8.10-1), V is the vertical shear due to the actual loads, v is the vertical shear due 
to a unit load acting at the section where the deflection is desired, A is the area of the 
section, G is the modulus of rigidity, F is a factor depending on the form of the cross 
section, and the integration extends over the entire length of the beam, with due regard 
to the signs of V and v. For three solid sections, a rectangle, a triangle with base either 
up or down, and a trapezoid with parallel sides top and bottom, F = 6 5

If the I- or box beam has flanges of nonuniform thickness, it may be replaced by an 
“equivalent” section whose flanges, of uniform thickness, have the same width and 
areas as those of the actual section (Ref. 19). Approximate results may be obtained for 
I-beams using F = 1 and taking for A the area of the web.

The deflection due to shear will usually be negligible in metal beams unless the 
span/depth ratio is extremely small; in wood beams, because of the small value of G 
compared with E, deflection due to shear is much more important. In computing deflec-
tions it may be allowed for by using for E a value obtained from bending tests (shear

deflection ignored) on beams of similar proportions or a value about 10% less than that 
found by testing in direct compression if the span/depth ratio is between 12 and 24. For 
larger ratios the effect of shear is negligible, and for lower ratios it should be calculated 
by the preceding method.
For extremely short deep beams, the assumption of linear stress distribution, on 
which the simple theory of flexure is based, is no longer valid. Equation (8.1-1) gives 
sufficiently accurate results for span/depth ratios down to about 3; for still smaller 
ratios it was believed formerly that the actual stresses were smaller than the formula 
indicates (Refs. 1 and 2), but more recent analyses by numerical methods (Refs. 43 and 
44) indicate that the contrary is true. These analyses show that at s/d between 1.5 and 1, 
depending on the manner of loading and support, the stress distribution changes radi-
cally and the ratio of maximum stress to Mc/I becomes greater than 1 and increases 
rapidly as s/d becomes still smaller. In the following table, the influence of s/d on both 
maximum fiber stress and maximum horizontal shear stress is shown in accordance 
with the solution given in Ref. 43. Reference 44 gives comparable results, and both 
strain-gage measurements (Ref. 45) and photoelastic studies (Ref. 46) support the con-
clusions reached in these analyses.
These established facts concerning elastic stresses in short beams seem incompatible 
with the contrary influence of s/d on modulus of rupture, discussed in Sec. 8.15, unless 
it is assumed that there is a very radical redistribution of stress as soon as plastic action 
sets in.
The stress produced by a concentrated load acting on a very short cantilever beam or 
projection (gear tooth, sawtooth, screw thread) can be found by the following formula, 
due to Heywood (Chap. 2, Ref. 28) and modified by Kelley and Pedersen (Ref. 59). 

192	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t
As given here, the formula follows this modification, with some changes in notation. 
Figure 8.16 represents the profile of the beam, assumed to be of uniform thickness t. 
ED is the axis or center line of the beam; it bisects the angle between the sides if these 
are straight; otherwise it is drawn through the centers of two unequal inscribed circles. 
W represents the load; its line of action, or load line, intersects the beam profile at C and 
the beam axis at O. The inscribed parabola, with vertex at O, is tangent to the fillet on 
the tension side of the beam at A, which is the point of maximum tensile stress. (A can 
be located by making AF equal to FE by trial, F being the intersection of a perpendicular 
to the axis at O and a trial tangent to the fillet.) B is the corresponding point on the com-
pression side, and D is the intersection of the beam axis with section AB. The dimen-
sions a and e are perpendicular, respectively, to the load line and to the beam axis, r is 
the fillet radius, and b is the straight-line distance from A to C. The tensile stress at A is 
given by

Here the quantity in the first pair of brackets is the factor of stress concentration for the 
fillet. In the second pair of brackets, the first term represents the bending moment 
divided by the section modulus, the second term represents the effect of the component 
of the load along the tangent line, positive when tensile, and the third term represents 
what Heywood calls the proximity effect, which may be regarded as an adjustment for 
the very small span/depth ratio.
Kelley and Pedersen have suggested a further refinement in locating the point of 
maximum stress, putting it at an angular distance equal to 25° − ½ α, positive toward 
the root of the fillet. Heywood suggests locating this point at 30° from the outer end 
of the fillet, reducing this to 12° as the ratio of b to e increases; also, Heywood locates 
the moment of W about a point halfway between A and B instead of about D. For most 
cases the slightly different procedures seem to give comparable results and agree well 
with photoelastic analysis. However, more recent experimental studies (1963), includ-
ing fatigue tests, indicate that actual stresses may considerably exceed those computed 
by the formula (Ref. 63).

8.11  Beams of Relatively Great Width
Because of prevention of the lateral deformation that would normally accompany the 
fiber stresses, wide beams, such as thin metallic strips, are more rigid than the formulas 
of Sec. 8.1 indicate. This stiffening effect is taken into account by using E/(1 − v2) instead 
of E in the formulas for deflection and curvature if the beams are very wide (Ref. 21). 
The anticlastic curvature that exists on narrow rectangular beams is still present at the 
extreme edges of very wide beams, but the central region remains flat in a transverse 
direction and transverse bending stresses equal to Poisson’s ratio times the longitudinal 
bending stresses are present. For rectangular beams of moderate width, Ashwell 
(Ref. 10) shows that the stiffness depends not only upon the ratio of depth to width of 
the beam but also upon the radius of curvature to which the beam is bent. For a rectan-
gular beam of width b and depth h bent to a radius of curvature ρ by a bending moment M, 
these variables are related by the expression 1/ρ = M/KEI, where I = bh3/12, and the fol-
lowing table of values for K is given for several values of Poisson’s ratio and for the 
quantity b2/ρh.

In very short wide beams, such as the concrete slabs used as highway-bridge flooring, the 
deflection and fiber-stress distribution cannot be regarded as uniform across the width. In 
calculating the strength of such a slab, it is convenient to make use of the concept of effec-
tive width, i.e., the width of a spanwise strip which, acting as a beam with uniform extreme 
fiber stress equal to the maximum stress in the slab, develops the same resisting moment 
as does the slab. The effective width depends on the manner of support, manner of load-
ing, and ratio of breadth to span b/a. It has been determined by Holl (Ref. 22) for a number 
of assumed conditions, and the results are given in the following table for a slab that is 
freely supported at each of two opposite edges (Fig. 8.17). Two kinds of loading are con-
sidered, viz. uniform load over the entire slab and load uniformly distributed over a 
central circular area of radius c. The ratio of the effective width e to the span a is given for 
each of a number of ratios of c to slab thickness h and each of a number of b/a values.

For the same case (a slab that is supported at opposite edges and loaded on a central 
circular area) Westergaard (Ref. 23) gives e = 0.58a + 4c as an approximate expression for 
effective width. Morris (Ref. 24) gives e = ½ e
d
c +  as an approximate expression for the 
effective width for midspan off-center loading, where ec is the effective width for central 
loading and d is the distance from the load to the nearer unsupported edge.
For a slab that is fixed at two opposite edges and uniformly loaded, the stresses and 
deflections may be calculated with sufficient accuracy by the ordinary beam formulas, 
replacing E by E
v
/(
).

 For a slab thus supported and loaded at the center, the maxi-
mum stresses occur under the load, except for relatively large values of c, where they 
occur at the midpoints of the fixed edges. The effective widths are approximately as 
given in the following table (values from the curves of Ref. 22). Here b/a and c have the

Holl (Ref. 22) discusses the deflections of a wide beam with two edges supported and 
the distribution of pressure under the supported edges. The problem of determining 
the effective width in concrete slabs and tests made for that purpose are discussed by 
Kelley (Ref. 25), who also gives a brief bibliography on the subject.
The case of a very wide cantilever slab under a concentrated load is discussed by 
MacGregor (Ref. 26), Holl (Ref. 27), Jaramillo (Ref. 47), Wellauer and Seireg (Ref. 48), 
Little (Ref. 49), Small (Ref. 50), and others. For the conditions represented in Fig. 8.18, 
a cantilever plate of infinite length with a concentrated load, the bending stress σ at

These values are based on the analysis of Jaramillo (Ref. 47), who assumes an infinite 
length for the plate, and are in good agreement, so far as comparable, with coefficients 
given by MacGregor (Ref. 26). They differ only slightly from results obtained by Holl 
(Ref. 27) for a length/span ratio of 4 and by Little (Ref. 49) for a length/span ratio of 5 
and are in good agreement with available test data.
Wellauer and Seireg (Ref. 48) discuss the results of tests on beams of various propor-
tions and explain and illustrate an empirical method by which the Km values obtained by 
Jaramillo (Ref. 47) for the infinite plate under concentrated loading can be used to deter-
mine approximately the stress in a finite plate under an arbitrary transverse loading.
The stresses corresponding to the tabulated values of Km are span-wise (x direction) 
stresses; the maximum crosswise (z direction) stress occurs under the load when the load 
is applied at the midpoint of the free edge and is approximately equal to the maximum 
spanwise stress for that loading.
Although the previous formulas are based on the assumption of infinite width of a 
slab, tests (Ref. 26) on a plate with a width of 8½ in and span a of 1¼ in showed close 
agreement between calculated and measured deflections, and Holl’s analysis (Ref. 27), 
based on the assumption of a plate width four times the span, gives results that differ 
only slightly from MacGregor’s (Ref. 26). The formulas given should therefore be appli-
cable to slabs of breadth as small as four times the span.

8.12  Beams with Wide Flanges; Shear Lag
In thin metal construction, box, T-, or I-beams with very wide thin cover plates or flanges 
are sometimes used, and when a thin plate is stiffened by an attached member, a portion 
of the plate may be considered as a flange, acting integrally with the attached member 
which forms the web; examples are to be found in ship hulls, floors, tanks, and aircraft. 
In either type of construction the question arises as to what width of flange or plate 
would be considered effective; i.e., what width, uniformly stressed to the maximum 
stress that actually occurs, would provide a resisting moment equal to that of the actual 
stresses, which are greatest near the web and diminish as the distance from it increases.
This problem has been considered by several investigators; the results tabulated on 
page 197 are due to Hildebrand and Reissner (Ref. 38), Winter (Ref. 39), and Miller (Ref. 28).
Let b = actual net width of the flange (or clear distance between webs in continuous 
plate and stiffener construction), let l = span, and let ′ =
b
 effective width of the flange at 
the section of maximum bending moment. Then the approximate value of ′b
b
/  , which 
varies with the loading and with the ratio l/b, can be found for beams of uniform sec-
tion in the table on page 197. (In this table the case numbers refer to the manner of load-
ing and support represented in Table 8.1.) See also Ref. 37.
Some of the more important conclusions stated in Ref. 38 can be summarized as 
follows:
The amount of shear lag depends not only on the method of loading and support 
and the ratio of span to flange width but also on the ratio of G to E and on the ratio

 where Iw and Is are the moments of inertia about the neutral axis 
of the beam of the side plates and cover plates, respectively. (The values tabulated from 
Ref. 38 are for G/E = 0.375 and m = 2.) The value of ′b
b
/  increases with increasing m, but 
for values of m between 1.5 and 2.5 the variation is small enough to be disregarded. 
Shear lag at the critical section does not seem to be affected appreciably by the taper of 
the beam in width, but the taper in cover-plate thickness may have an important effect. 
In beams with fixed ends the effect of shear lag at the end sections is the same as for a 
cantilever of span equal to the distance from the point of inflection to the adjacent end.
In Ref. 39 it is stated that for a given l/b ratio the effect of shear lag is practically the 
same for box, I-, T-, and U-beams.
Flange in Compression
The preceding discussion and tabulated factors apply to any case in which the flange is 
subjected to tension or to compression less than that required to produce elastic insta-
bility (see Chap. 15). When a thin flange or sheet is on the compression side, however, 
it may be stressed beyond the stability limit. For this condition, the effective width 
decreases with the actual stress. A formula for effective width used in aircraft design is
 ′ =
b
Kt E
s  
where s is the maximum compressive stress (adjacent to the supporting web or webs) 
and K is a coefficient which may be conservatively taken as 0.85 for box beams and 0.60 
for a T- or an I-beam having flanges with unsupported outer edges.
A theoretical analysis that takes into account both compressive buckling and shear 
lag is described in Ref. 40. Problems involving shear lag and buckling are most 
frequently encountered in design with thin-gage metal; good guides to such design are

8.13  Beams with Very Thin Webs
In beams with extremely thin webs, such as are used in airplane construction, buck-
ling due to shear will occur at stresses well below the elastic limit. This can be pre-
vented if the web is made shear-resistant by the addition of stiffeners such as those 
used in plate girders, but the number of these required may be excessive. Instead of 
making the web shear-resistant, it may be permitted to buckle elastically without 
damage, the shear being carried wholly in diagonal tension. This tension tends to pull 
the upper and lower flanges together, and to prevent this, vertical struts are provided 
which carry the vertical component of the diagonal web tension. A girder so designed 
is, in effect, a Pratt truss, the web replacing the diagonal-tension members and the 
vertical struts constituting the compression members. In appearance, these struts 
resemble the stiffeners of an ordinary plate girder, but their function is obviously 
quite different.
A beam of this kind is called a diagonal-tension field beam, or Wagner beam, after Pro-
fessor Herbert Wagner of Danzig, who is largely responsible for developing the theory. 
Because of its rather limited field of application, only one example of the Wagner beam 
will be considered here, viz. a cantilever under end load.
Let P = end load, h = depth of the beam, t = thickness of the web, d = spacing of the 
vertical struts, x = distance from the loaded end to the section in question, Ht and Hc = total 
stresses in the tension and compression flanges, respectively, at the given section, C = total 
compression on a vertical strut, and f = unit diagonal tensile stress in the web. Then

The vertical component of the web tension constitutes a beam loading on each indi-
vidual flange between struts; the maximum value of the resulting bending moment 
occurs at the struts and is given by Mf = 1/12 Pd2/h.  The flexural stresses due to Mf must 
be added to the stresses due to Ht or Hc  , which may be found simply by dividing Ht or 
Hc by the area of the corresponding flange.
The horizontal component of the web tension causes a bending moment M = 1/8 Ph 
in the vertical strut at the end of the beam unless bending there is prevented by some 
system of bracing. This end strut must also distribute the load to the web, and should 
be designed to carry the load as a pin-ended column of length ½ h as well as to resist the 
moment imposed by the web tension.
The intermediate struts are designed as pin-ended columns with lengths somewhat 
less than h. An adjacent portion of the web is included in the area of the column, the 
width of the strip considered effective being 30t in the case of aluminum and 60t in the 
case of steel.
Obviously the preceding formulas will apply also to a beam with end supports and 
center load if P is replaced by the reaction ½ P. Because of various simplifying assump-
tions made in the analysis, these formulas are conservative; in particular the formula 
for stress in the vertical struts or stiffeners gives results much larger than actual stresses 
that have been discovered experimentally. More accurate analyses, together with exper-
imental data from various sources, will be found in Refs. 30, 34, 35, 62, and 69–71.

8.14  Beams Not Loaded in Plane of Symmetry; Flexural Center
The formulas for stress and deflection given in Sec. 8.1 are valid if the beam is loaded in 
a plane of symmetry; they are also valid if the applied loads are parallel to either prin-
cipal central axis of the beam section, but unless the loads also pass through the elastic 
axis, the beam will be subjected to torsion as well as bending.
For the general case of a beam of any section loaded by a transverse load P in any 
plane therefore the solution comprises the following steps: (1) The load P is resolved into 
an equal and parallel force ′
P  passing through the flexural center Q of the section, and a 
twisting couple T equal to the moment of P about Q; (2) ′
P  is resolved at Q into rectangu-
lar components ′
Pu and ′
Pv, each parallel to a principal central axis of the section; (3) the 
flexural stresses and deflections due to ′
Pu and ′
Pv, are calculated independently by the 
formulas of Sec. 8.1 and superimposed to find the effect of ′
P ; and (4) the stresses due to 
T are computed independently and superimposed on the stresses due to ′
P , giving the 
stresses due to the actual loading. (It is to be noted that T may cause longitudinal fiber 
stresses as well as shear stresses. See Sec. 10.3 and the example at the end of this section.) 
If there are several loads, the effect of each is calculated separately and these effects added. 
For a distributed load the same procedure is followed as for a concentrated load.
The above procedure requires the determination of the position of the flexural center Q. 
For any section having two or more axes of symmetry (rectangle, I-beam, etc.) and for any 
section having a point of symmetry (equilateral triangle, Z-bar, etc.), Q is at the centroid. For 
any section having only one axis of symmetry, Q is on that axis but in general not at the 
centroid. For such sections and for unsymmetrical sections in general, the position of Q 
must be determined by calculation, direct experiment, or the soap-film method (Sec. 6.4).
Table 8.12 gives the position of the flexural center for each of a number of sections.
Neutral Axis
When a beam is bent by one or more loads that lie in a plane not parallel to either princi-
pal central axis of the section, the neutral axis passes through the centroid but is not per-
pendicular to the plane of the loads. Let axes 1 and 2 be the principal central axes of the 
section, and let I1 and I2 represent the corresponding moments of inertia. Then, if the plane 
of the loads makes with axis 1 an angle α, the neutral axis makes with axis 2 an angle β 
such that tan β = (I2/I1) tan α. It can be seen from this equation that the neutral axis tends 
to approach the principal central axis about which the moment of inertia is least.
Example  Figure 8.19(a) represents a cantilever beam of channel section under a diagonal end load 
applied at one corner. It is required to determine the maximum resulting fiber stress.
Solution  For the section (Fig. 8.19b): Iu = 5.61 in4, Iv = 19.9 in4; b = 3.875 in, h = 5.75 in, and t = ¼ in. 
By the formula from Table 8.12, e = b2h2t/4Iv = 1.55 in; therefore the flexural center is at Q, as shown. 
When the load is resolved into vertical and horizontal components at Q and a couple, the results are 
as shown in Fig. 8.19(b). (Vertical and horizontal components are used because the principal central 
axes u and v are vertical and horizontal.)
The maximum fiber stress will occur at the corner where the stresses due to the vertical and 
horizontal bending moments are of the same kind; at the upper-right corner f both stresses are tensile, 
and since f is farther from the u axis than the lower-left corner g where both stresses are compressive, 
it will sustain the greater stress. This stress will be simply the sum of the stresses due to the vertical 
and horizontal components of the load, or

The effect of the couple depends on the way in which the inner end of the beam is supported. If it is 
simply constrained against rotation in the planes of bending and twisting, the twisting moment will be 
resisted wholly by shear stress on the cross section, and these stresses can be found by the appropriate 
torsion formula of Table 10.1. If, however, the beam is built in so that the flanges are fixed in the horizontal 
plane, then part of the torque is resisted by the bending rigidity of the flanges and the corresponding 
moment causes a further fiber stress. This can be found by using the formulas of Sec. 10.3.

8.15  Straight Uniform Beams (Common Case); Ultimate Strength
When a beam is stressed beyond the elastic limit, plane sections remain plane or nearly 
so but unit stresses are no longer proportional to strains and hence no longer propor-
tional to distance from the neutral surface. If the material has similar stress-strain curves 
in tension and compression, the stress distribution above and below the neutral surface 
will be similar and the neutral axis of any section which is symmetric about a horizontal 
axis will still pass through the centroid; if the material has different properties in ten-
sion and compression, then the neutral axis will shift away from the side on which the 

B e a m s ;  F l e x u r e  o f  S t r a i g h t  B a r s 	
201
fibers yield the most; this shift causes an additional departure from the stress distribu-
tion assumed by the theory outlined in Sec. 8.1.
Failure in Bending
The strength of a beam of ordinary proportions is determined by the maximum 
bending moment it can sustain. For beams of nonductile material (cast iron, con-
crete, or seasoned wood) this moment may be calculated by the formula 
M
I c
m =

if
 the modulus of rupture, is known. The modulus of rupture depends 
on the material and other factors (see Sec. 3.11), and attempts have been made to 
calculate it for a given material and section from the form of the complete stress-
strain diagram. Thus for cast iron an approximate value of ′
σ  may be found by the 
formula ′ =
′
σ
σ
K c z
t
/
, where c is the distance to the extreme fiber, ′z  is the distance 
from the neutral axis to the centroid of the tensile part of the section, and K is an 
experimental coefficient equal to 6/5 for sections that are flat at the top and bottom 
(rectangle, I, T, etc.) and 4/3 for sections that are pointed or convex at the top and 
bottom (circle, diamond, etc.) (Ref. 4). Some tests indicate that this method of calcu-
lating the breaking strength of cast iron is sometimes inaccurate but generally errs 
on the side of safety (Ref. 5).
In general, the breaking strength of a beam can be predicted best from experimen-
tally determined values of the rupture factor and ultimate strength or the form factor 
and modulus of rupture. The rupture factors are based on the ultimate tensile strength 
for all materials except wood, for which it is based on compressive strength. Form fac-
tors are based on a rectangular section. For structural steel, wrought aluminum, and 
other ductile metals, where beams do not actually break, the modulus of rupture means 
the computed fiber stress at the maximum bending moment (Refs. 6–9).
When the maximum bending moment occurs at but one section, as for a single con-
centrated load, the modulus of rupture is higher than when the maximum moment 
extends over a considerable part of the span. For instance, the modulus of rupture of 
short beams of brittle material is about 20% higher when determined by center loading 
than when determined by third-point loading. The disparity decreases as the span/depth 
ratio increases.
Beams of ductile material (structural steel or aluminum) do not ordinarily fracture 
under static loading but fail through excessive deflection. For such beams, if they are of 
relatively thick section so as to preclude local buckling, the maximum bending moment 
is that which corresponds to plastic yielding throughout the section. This maximum 
moment, or “plastic” moment, is usually denoted by Mp and can be calculated by the 
formula M
Z
p
y
= σ
, where σ y is the lower yield point of the material and Z, called the 
plastic section modulus, is the arithmetical sum of the statical moments about the neutral 
axis of the parts of the cross section above and below that axis. Thus, for a rectangular 
section of depth d and width b,

This method of calculating the maximum resisting moment of a ductile-material 
beam is widely used in “plastic design” and is discussed further in Sec. 8.16. It is impor-
tant to note that when the plastic moment has been developed, the neutral axis divides 
the cross-sectional area into halves and so is not always a centroidal axis. It is also 
important to note that the plastic moment is always greater than the moment required

denoted by My   , is equal to σ yI c

This ratio Z/(I/c), called the shape factor, depends on the form of the cross section. For a 
solid rectangle it would be ¼ bd2/ 1/6 bd2, or 1.5; for an I-section it is usually about 1.15. 
Table A.1 gives formulas or numerical values for the plastic section modulus Z and for 
the shape factor for most of the cross sections listed.
In tubes and beams of thin open section, local buckling or crippling will sometimes 
occur before the full plastic resisting moment is realized, and the length of the member 
will have an influence. Tubes of steel or aluminum alloy generally will develop a mod-
ulus of rupture exceeding the ultimate tensile strength when the ratio of diameter to 
wall thickness is less than 50 for steel or 35 for aluminum. Wide-flanged steel beams 
will develop the full plastic resisting moment when the outstanding width/thickness 
ratio is less than 8.7 for σ y = 33,000 lb/in2 or 8.3 for σy = 36,000 lb/in2. Charts giving the 
effective modulus of rupture of steel, aluminum, and magnesium tubes of various pro-
portions may be found in Ref. 55.
Failure in Shear
Failure by an actual shear fracture is likely to occur only in wood beams, where the 
shear strength parallel to the grain is, of course, small.
In I-beams and similar thin-webbed sections the diagonal compression that accom-
panies shear (Sec. 7.5) may lead to a buckling failure (see the discussion of web buckling 
that follows), and in beams of cast iron and concrete the diagonal tension that similarly 
accompanies shear may cause rupture. The formula for shear stress [Eq. (8.1-2)] may be 
considered valid as long as the fiber stresses do not exceed the proportional limit, and 
therefore it may be used to calculate the vertical shear necessary to produce failure in 
any case where the ultimate shearing strength of the beam is reached while the fiber 
stresses, at the section of maximum shear, are still within the proportional limit.
Web Buckling; Local Failure
An I-beam or similar thin-webbed member may fail by buckling of the web owing to 
diagonal compression when the shear stress reaches a certain value. Ketchum and Draf-
fin (Ref. 11) and Wendt and Withey (Ref. 12) found that in light I-beams this type of 
buckling occurs when the shear stress, calculated by τ = 1 25
.
 V/web area (Ref. 11) or 
τ = V/web area (Ref. 12), reaches a value equal to the unit load that can be carried by a 
vertical strip of the beam as a round-ended column. For the thin webs of the beams 
tested, such a thin strip would be computed as a Euler column; for heavier beams an 
appropriate parabolic or other formula should be used (Chap. 12).
In plate girders, web buckling may be prevented by vertical or diagonal stiffeners, 
usually consisting of double angles that are riveted or welded, one on each side of the 
web. Steel-construction specifications (Ref. 13) require that such stiffeners be provided

of the web between flanges, t is the web thickness, v is the shear stress V ht

times designed to have a moment of inertia about an axis parallel to the web given by

4 3  where V = the (total) vertical shear and d = the stiffener spac-
ing center to center (Ref. 14).
Buckling failure may occur also as a result of vertical compression at a support or 
concentrated load, which is caused by either column-type buckling of the web (Refs. 11 
and 12) or crippling of the web at the toe of the fillet (Ref. 15). To guard against this 
latter type of failure, present specifications provide that for interior loads

trated load or end reaction, t the web thickness, N the length of bearing, and k the dis-
tance from the outer face of the flange to the web toe of the fillet. Here R is in pounds 
and all linear dimensions are in inches.
Wood beams will crush locally if the supports are too narrow or if a load is 
applied over too small a bearing area. The unit bearing stress in either case is calcu-
lated by dividing the force by the nominal bearing area, no allowance being made 
for the nonuniform distribution of pressure consequent upon bending (Ref. 9). 
Metal beams also may be subjected to high local pressure stresses; these are dis-
cussed in Chap. 14.
Lateral Buckling
The compression flange of an I-beam or similar member may fail as a column as a result 
of lateral buckling if it is unsupported. Such buckling may be elastic or plastic; that is, it 
may occur at a maximum fiber stress below or above the elastic limit. In the first case 
the buckling is an example of elastic instability, for which relevant formulas are given 
in Table 15.1. For buckling above the elastic range analytical solutions are difficult to 
obtain, and empirical expressions based on experiment are used (as will be shown to be 
true also of the columns discussed in Chap. 12).
Moore (Ref. 16) found that standard I-beams fail by lateral buckling when
 ′ =

where ′s  is the compressive stress in the extreme fiber [computed by Eq. (8.1-1)], l is 
the span (in inches), r is the radius of gyration (in inches) of the beam section about 
a central axis parallel to the web, and m is a coefficient which depends on the man-
ner of loading and support and has the following values:

test results is given by
 ′ =

24 000

,
 
where the terms have the same meaning and m the same values as given 
previously.
The beams tested by Moore generally failed at stresses below but very close to the 
yield point and so probably could be regarded as representing plastic buckling. The 
lighter beams tested by Ketchum and Draffin, however, failed at stresses below the limit 
of proportionality and are examples of elastic buckling.
In Ref. 13 rules are given for the reduction in allowable compressive stress accord-
ing to the unbraced length of the compression flange. A review of the literature on this 
subject of the lateral buckling of structural members and a bibliography through 1959 
are to be found in Ref. 58.
Narrow rectangular beams may fail also as a result of buckling of the compression 
edge. When this buckling occurs below the elastic limit, the strength is determined by 
elastic stability; formulas for this case are given in Table 15.1. For buckling at stresses 
beyond the elastic limit, no simple formula for the critical stress can be given, but meth-
ods for calculating this critical stress are given for aluminum beams by Dumont and 
Hill (Ref. 17) and for wood beams by Trayer and March (Ref. 18).
8.16  Plastic, or Ultimate Strength, Design
The foregoing discussion of beams and frames is based for the most part on the 
assumption of purely elastic action and on the acceptance of maximum fiber stress 
as the primary criterion of safety. These constitute the basis of elastic analysis and 
design. An alternative and often preferred method of design, applicable to rigid 
frames and statically indeterminate beams made of materials capable of plastic 
action, is the method of plastic, or ultimate strength, design. It is based on the fact 
that such a frame or beam cannot deflect indefinitely or collapse until the full plas-
tic moment Mp (see Sec. 8.15) has been developed at each of several critical sections. 
If it is assumed that the plastic moment—a determinable couple—does indeed act 
at each such section, then the problem becomes a statically determinate one and the 
load corresponding to the collapse condition can be readily calculated.
A simple illustration of the procedure is afforded by the beam of Fig. 8.20(a), corre-
sponding to case lc of Table 8.1. Suppose it is desired to determine the maximum value 
of the load W that the beam can support. It is shown by elastic analysis, and is indeed 
apparent from inspection, that the maximum bending moments occur at the load and at 

B e a m s ;  F l e x u r e  o f  S t r a i g h t  B a r s 	
205
the left end of the beam. The maximum possible value of each such moment is Mp. It is 
evident that the beam cannot collapse until the moment at each of these points reaches 
this value. Therefore, when W has reached its maximum value and collapse is 
imminent, the beam is acted on by the force system represented in Fig. 8.20(b); there 
is a plastic hinge and a known couple Mp at each of the critical sections and the 
problem is statically determinate. For equilibrium of the right half, R

In attempting to predict the collapse load on the basis of elastic analysis, it is easy to 
fall into the error of equating the maximum elastic moment 3/16 Wl at the wall (Table 8.1) 
to Mp, thus obtaining W = 16/3 Mp/l. This erroneous procedure fails to take into account 
the fact that as W increases and yielding commences and progresses at the wall section, 
there is a redistribution of moments; the moment at the wall becomes less than 3/16 Wl, 
and the moment at the load becomes greater than 5/32 Wl until finally each moment 
becomes equal to Mp. An important point to note is that although the elastic moments 
are affected by even a very slight departure from the assumed conditions—perfect fix-
ity at one end and rigid support at the other—the collapse load is not thus affected. So 
long as the constraints are rigid enough to develop the plastic hinges as indicated, the 
ultimate load will be the same. Similarly, the method does not require that the beam be 
uniform in section, although a local reduction in section leading to the formation of a 
hinge at some point other than those assumed, of course, would alter the solution.
For a beam with multiple concentrated transverse loads or with distributed trans-
verse loads, the locations of hinges are not known and must be assumed and verified. 
A virtual work approach to plastic collapse may permit a more rapid analysis than does 
the use of equilibrium equations, see Ref. 66. Verification consists of using the equilib-
rium conditions to construct a moment diagram and determine that no moments larger 
than the locally permitted values of the fully plastic moment are present.
Since nonlinear behavior does not permit superposition of results, one must con-
sider all loads which are acting at a given time. If any of the several loads on a beam 
tend to cancel the maximum moments due to other loads, one must also consider the 
order in which the loads are applied in service to assure that the partially loaded beam 
has not collapsed before all loads have been applied.
Column 4 of Table A.1 contains an expression or a numerical value for the plastic 
section modulus Z and for the shape factor SF
Zc I
=
/  for many of the cross sections. 
Using the plastic section modulus and the value of the yield strength of the material, 
one can find the full plastic moment Mp. Table 8.13 contains expressions for the loadings 
Figure 8.20

which will cause plastic collapse and the locations of the plastic hinges associated with 
each such loading.
The following example problems illustrate (1) the direct use of the tabulated mate-
rial and (2) the use of the virtual work approach to a problem where two loads are 
applied simultaneously and where one plastic hinge location is not obvious.
Example 1  A hollow aluminum cylinder is used as a transversely loaded beam 6 ft long with a 3-in 
outer diameter and a 1-in inner diameter. It is fixed at both ends and subjected to a distributed loading 
which increases linearly from zero at midspan to a maximum value wl at the right end. The yield 
strength of this material is 27,000 psi, and the value of Wlc at plastic collapse is desired.
Solution  From Table A.1 case 15, the expression for the plastic section modulus is given as

Example 2  A steel beam of trapezoidal section is shown in Fig. 8.21. It is 1500 mm long, fixed at the 
right end and simply supported at the left end. The factor of safety of the loading shown is to be 
determined based on plastic collapse under a proportionately increased set of similar loads. The 
yield strength of the material is 200

 in both tension and compression. All dimensions are 
in millimeters.
Solution  First evaluate Mp. An examination of Table A.1 shows that the plastic section modulus for 
this cross section is not given. The yield strength in tension and compression is the same, so half the 
cross-sectional area of 2100
2
mm  will be in tension and half in compression under a fully developed 
plastic hinge. Calculations show that a horizontal axis 16.066 mm above the base will divide this area 
into equal parts. The centroid of the upper portion is 7.110 mm above this axis, and the centroid of 
the lower portion is 7.814 mm below. Therefore,

Let the concentrated load at collapse Pc be accompanied by a uniformly distributed load wc , which 
equals Pc/

1000  During a virtual displacement of the beam when plastic rotation is taking place 
about the fully developed plastic hinges, the elastic deformations and any deformations due to the 
development of the plastic hinges remain constant and can be neglected in computing the work done 
by the loading. The angles shown in Fig. 8.22 are not true slopes at these locations but merely represent 
the virtual rotations of the fully developed plastic hinges. The location of hinge A is not known at this 
point in the solution, but it is either under the concentrated load or somewhere in the portion of the 
beam under the distributed load.
Trial 1. Assume that hinge A is under the concentrated load and the virtual displacements are 
represented by Fig. 8.22(a). The work performed by the loads during their vertical displacements is 
absorbed by the two plastic hinges. The hinge at A rotates through the angle q

through the angle φ. Thus

. Using these two values and 
constructing a moment diagram, one finds that a maximum moment of 1 190

Mp will be present at a 
distance of 742 mm from the left end.
Thus the assumption that hinge A was under the concentrated load was incorrect. A second trial 
solution will be carried out by assuming that hinge A is a distance a from the left end.
Trial 2. Figure 8.22(b) shows the virtual displacements for this second assumption. Again set the 
virtual work done by the loading equal to the energy absorbed by the two plastic hinges, or

This then is the correct solution, and substituting the numerical value for Mp one gets Pc = 12 000

N 
and wc = 12 N/mm.  The applied loads were P = 4000 N and w = 4 N/mm, so the factor of safety 
is 3.0.
Because of the simplicity, these examples may give an exaggerated impression of 
the ease of plastic analysis, but they do indicate that for any indeterminate structure 
with strength that is determined primarily by resistance to bending, the method is well-
suited to the determination of ultimate load and—through the use of a suitable factor of 
safety—to design. Its accuracy has been proved by good agreement between computed 
and experimental ultimate loads for both beams and frames. An extended discussion of 
plastic analysis is not appropriate here, but the interested reader will find an extensive 
literature on the subject (Refs. 60 and 61).

Notation: W = load (force); w = unit load (force per unit length); Mo = applied couple (force-length); θo = externally created concentrated angular 
displacement (radians); Do = externally created concentrated lateral displacement (length); T – To = uniform temperature rise (degrees); T1 and 
T2 = temperature on outside and inside, respectively (degrees). HA  and HB are the horizontal end reactions at the left and right, respectively, 
and are positive to the left; VA and VB are the vertical end reactions at the left and right, respectively, and are positive upwards; MA and MB are 
the reaction moments at the left and right, respectively, and are positive clockwise. I

,
, and I3 are the respective area moments of inertia for 
bending in the plane of the frame for the three members (length to the fourth); E1, E2, and E3 are the respective moduli of elasticity (force per 
unit area); γ1, γ2, and γ3 are the respective temperature coefficients of expansions (unit strain per degree).

Notation: W = load (force); w = unit load (force per unit length); Mo = applied couple (force-length); θo = externally created concentrated angular 
displacement (radians); Do = externally created concentrated lateral displacement (length); γ = temperature coefficient of expansion (unit strain 
per degree); T1 and T2 = temperatures on top and bottom surfaces, respectively (degrees). RA and RB are the vertical end reactions at the left 
and right, respectively, and are positive upward. MA and MB are the reaction end moments at the left and right, respectively, and all moments 
are positive when producing compression on the upper portion of the beam cross section. The transverse shear force V is positive when acting 
upward on the left end of a portion of the beam. All applied loads, couples, and displacements are positive as shown. All slopes are in radians, 
and all temperatures are in degrees. All deflections are positive upward and slopes positive when up and to the right. Note that MA and RA are 
reactions, not applied loads. They exist only when necessary end restraints are provided.
  The following constants and functions, involving both beam constants and foundation constants, are hereby defined in order to permit 
condensing the tabulated formulas which follow.
kο = foundation modulus (unit stress per unit deflection); bο = beam width; and β

Table 8.5  Shear, Moment, Slope, and Deflection Formulas for Finite-Length Beams on Elastic Foundations (Continued)

248
Notation: All notation is the same as that for Table 8.5. No length is defined since these beams are assumed to extend from the left end, for which restraints are defined, to a length 
beyond that portion affected by the loading. Note that MA and RA are reactions, not applied loads.
  The following constants and functions, involving both beam constants and foundation constants, are hereby defined in order to permit condensing the tabulated formulas which follow.
ko = foundation modulus (unit stress per unit deflection); bo = beam width, and β = (
/
)
.

Table 8.7(d)  Reaction and Deflection Coefficient for Beams Under Simultaneous Axial and Transverse Loading: Fixed Ends

256
Notation: P = axial compressive load (force); all other notation is the same as that for Table 8.1. P must be less than Pcr where Pcr = K1π2E I/l 2 and 
where, for cases 1a−6a and 1f–6f, K1 = 0.25; for cases 1b−6b and 1e−6e; K1 = 1; for cases 1c−6c, K1 = 2.046; and for cases 1d−6d, K1 = 4.
  The following constants and functions are hereby defined in order to permit condensing the tabulated formulas which follow. k

Table 8.8  Shear, Moment, Slope, and Deflection Formulas for Beams Under Simultaneous Axial Compression and Transverse Loading (Continued )

270
Notation: P = axial tensile load (force); all other notation is the same as that for Table 8.1; see Table 8.8 for loading details.
  The following constants and functions are hereby defined in order to permit condensing the tabulated formulas which follow. k = (P/E I)1/2. (Note: See page 160 
for a definition of 〈x − a〉n.) The function sinh k〈x − a〉 is also defined as having a value of zero if x < a.

Notation: Mp = fully plastic bending moment (force-length); xh = position of a plastic hinge (length); Wc = 
concentrated load necessary to produce plastic collapse of the beam (force); wc = unit load necessary to 
produce plastic collapse of the beam (force per unit length); Moc = applied couple necessary to produce 
plastic collapse (force-length). The fully plastic bending moment Mp is the product of the yield strength of 
the material σys and the plastic section modulus Z found in Table A.1 for the given cross sections.

Curved Beams
9.1  Bending in the Plane of the Curve
In a straight beam having either a constant cross section or a cross section which changes 
gradually along the length of the beam, the neutral surface is defined as the longitudi-
nal surface of zero fiber stress when the member is subjected to pure bending. It con-
tains the neutral axis of every section, and these neutral axes pass through the centroids 
of the respective sections. In this section on bending in the plane of the curve, the use of 
the many formulas is restricted to those members for which that axis passing through 
the centroid of a given section and directed normal to the plane of bending of the mem-
ber is a principal axis. The one exception to this requirement is for a condition equiva-
lent to the beam being constrained to remain in its original plane of curvature such as 
by frictionless external guides.
To determine the stresses and deformations in curved beams satisfying the restric-
tions given above, one first identifies several cross sections and then locates the cen-
troids of each. From these centroidal locations the curved centroidal surface can be 
defined. For bending in the plane of the curve there will be at each section (1) a force N 
normal to the cross section and taken to act through the centroid, (2) a shear force V 
parallel to the cross section in a radial direction, and (3) a bending couple M in the plane 
of the curve. In addition there will be radial stresses σr in the curved beam to establish 
equilibrium. These internal loadings are shown in Fig. 9.1(a), and the stresses and defor-
mations due to each will be evaluated.
Circumferential Normal Stresses Due to Pure Bending
When a curved beam is bent in the plane of initial curvature, plane sections remain 
plane, but because of the different lengths of fibers on the inner and outer portions of 
the beam, the distribution of unit strain, and therefore stress, is not linear. The neutral 
axis does not pass through the centroid of the section and Eqs. (8.1-1) and (8.1-2) do not 
apply. The error involved in their use is slight as long as the radius of curvature is more 
than about eight times the depth of the beam. At that curvature the errors in the maxi-
mum stresses are in the range of 4–5%. The errors created by using the straight-beam 
formulas become large for sharp curvatures as shown in Table 9.1, which gives formu-
las and selected numerical data for curved beams of several cross sections and for 
varying degrees of curvature. In part the formulas and tabulated coefficients are taken 
from the University of Illinois Circular by Wilson and Quereau (Ref. 1) with modifica-
tions suggested by Neugebauer (Ref. 28). For cross sections not included in Table 9.1 
and for determining circumferential stresses at locations other than the extreme fibers,

one can find formulas in texts on advanced mechanics of materials, for example, 
Refs. 29 and 36.

where M is the applied bending moment, A is the area of the cross section, e is the dis-
tance from the centroidal axis to the neutral axis, and y and r locate the radial position 
of the desired stress from the neutral axis and the center of the curvature, respectively.

(9.1-2)
Equations (9.1-1) and (9.1-2) are based on derivations that neglect the contribution of 
radial normal stress to the circumferential strain. This assumption does not cause 
appreciable error for curved beams of compact cross section for which the radial nor-
mal stresses are small, and it leads to acceptable answers for beams having thin webs 
where, although the radial stresses are higher, they occur in regions of the cross sec-
tion where the circumferential bending stresses are small. The use of the equations in 
Table 9.1 and of Eqs. (9.1-1) and (9.1-2) is limited to values of R d
/ > 0 6
.  where, for a 
rectangular cross section, a comparison of this mechanics-of-materials solution 
[Eq. (9.1-1)] to the solution using the theory of elasticity shows the mechanics of mate-
rials solution to indicate stresses approximately 10% too large.
While in theory the curved-beam formula for circumferential bending stress, Eq. 
(9.1-1), could be used for beams of very large radii of curvature, one should not use 
the expression for e from Eq. (9.1-2) for cases where R d
/ , the ratio of the radius of the 
curvature R to the depth of the cross section, exceeds 8. The calculation for e would 
have to be done with careful attention to precision on a computer or calculator to get

e which becomes very accurate for large values of R d

where Ic is the area moment of inertia of the cross section about the centroidal axis. 
Using this expression for e and letting R approach infinity leads to the usual straight-
beam formula for bending stress.
For complex sections where the table or Eq. (9.1-3) are inappropriate, a numerical 
technique that provides excellent accuracy can be employed. This technique is illus-
trated on pp. 318–321 of Ref. 36.

or if R d

Circumferential Normal Stresses Due to Hoop Tension N(M = 0) 
The normal force N was chosen to act through the centroid of the cross section, so a 
constant normal stress N A
/
 would satisfy equilibrium. Solutions carried out for rectan-
gular cross sections using the theory of elasticity show essentially a constant normal 
stress with higher values on a thin layer of material on the inside of the curved section 
and lower values on a thin layer of material on the outside of the section. In most engi-
neering applications the stresses due to the moment M are much larger than those due 
to N, so the assumption of uniform stress due to N is reasonable.
Shear Stress Due to The Radial Shear Force V
Although Eq. (8.1-2) does not apply to curved beams, Eq. (8.1-13), used as for a straight 
beam, gives the maximum shear stress with sufficient accuracy in most instances. Again 
an analysis for a rectangular cross section carried out using the theory of elasticity 
shows that the peak shear stress in a curved beam occurs not at the centroidal axis as it 
does for a straight beam but toward the inside surface of the beam. For a very sharply 
curved beam, R d
/ = 0 7
. , the peak shear stress was 2 04
.
V A
/  at a position one-third of 
the way from the inner surface to the centroid. For a sharply curved beam, R d

the peak shear stress was 1 56

 at a position 80% of the way from the inner surface 
to the centroid. These values can be compared to a peak shear stress of 1 5
. V A
/  at the 
centroid for a straight beam of rectangular cross section. 
If a mechanics-of-materials solution for the shear stress in a curved beam is desired, 
the element in Fig. 9.2(b) can be used and moments taken about the center of curvature.

Equation (9.1-4) gives conservative answers for the peak values of shear stress in rect-
angular sections when compared to elasticity solutions. The locations of peak shear 
stress are the same in both analyses, and the error in magnitude is about 1%.
Radial Stresses Due to Moment M and Normal Force N
Owing to the radial components of the fiber stresses, radial stresses are present in a 
curved beam; these are tensile when the bending moment tends to straighten the beam 
and compressive under the reverse condition. A mechanics-of-materials solution may 
be developed by summing radial forces and summing forces perpendicular to the 
radius using the element in Fig. 9.2.

(9.1-6)
Equation (9.1-6) is as accurate for radial stress as is Eq. (9.1-4) for shear stress when 
used for a rectangular cross section and compared to an elasticity solution. However, 
the complexity of Eq. (9.1-6) coupled with the fact that the stresses due to N are gener-
ally smaller than those due to M leads to the usual practice of omitting the terms 
involving N. This leads to the equation for radial stress found in many texts, such as 
Refs. 29 and 36.

Again care must be taken when using Eqs. (9.1-4), (9.1-6), and (9.1-7) to use an accurate 
value for e as explained above in the discussion following Eq. (9.1-3).
Radial stress is usually not a major consideration in compact sections for it is smaller 
than the circumferential stress and is low where the circumferential stresses are large. 
However, in flanged sections with thin webs the radial stress may be large at the junc-
tion of the flange and web, and the circumferential stress is also large at this position. 
This can lead to excessive shear stress and the possible yielding if the radial and circum-
ferential stresses are of opposite sign. A large compressive radial stress in a thin web 
Figure 9.2 

C u r v e d  B e a m s

may also lead to a buckling of the web. Corrections for curved-beam formulas for sec-
tions having thin flanges are discussed in the next paragraph but corrections are also 
needed if a section has a thin web and very thick flanges. Under these conditions the 
individual flanges tend to rotate about their own neutral axes and larger radial and 
shear stresses are developed. Broughton et al. discuss this configuration in Ref. 31
Example 1  The sharply curved beam with an elliptical cross section shown in Fig. 9.3(a) has been used 
in a machine and has carried satisfactorily a bending moment of 2 106
(
) N-mm. All dimensions on the 
figures and in the calculations are given in millimeters. A redesign does not provide as much space 
for this part, and a decision has been made to salvage the existing stock of this part by machining 
10 mm from the inside. The question has been asked as to what maximum moment the modified part 
can carry without exceeding the peak stress in the original installation. 
Solution  First compute the maximum stress in the original section by using case 6 of Table 9.1. R = 100,

One might not expect this increase in M unless consideration is given to the machining away of a 
stress concentration. Be careful, however, to note that, although removing the material reduced the 
peak stress in this case, the part will undergo greater deflections under the same moment that it 
carried before.

Example 2  A curved beam with a cross section shown in Fig. 9.4 is subjected to a bending moment 
of 107N-mm in the plane of the curve and to a normal load of 80,000 N in tension. The center of the 
circular portion of the cross section has a radius of curvature of 160 mm. All dimensions are given 
and used in the formulas in millimeters. The circumferential stresses in the inner and outer fibers 
are desired. 
Solution  This section can be modeled as a summation of three sections: (1) a solid circular section, 
(2) a negative (materials removed) segment of a circle, and (3) a solid rectangular section. The 
section properties are evaluated in the order listed above and the results summed for the composite 
section.

Curved Beams with Wide Flanges
In reinforcing rings for large pipes, airplane fuselages, and ship hulls, the combina-
tion of a curved sheet and attached web or stiffener forms a curved beam with wide 
flanges. Formulas for the effective width of a flange in such a curved beam are given in 
Ref. 9 and are as follows.
When the flange is indefinitely wide (e.g., the inner flange of a pipe-stiffener ring), 
the effective width is
	
 ′ =
b
Rt
1 56
.
 	
where b′ is the total width assumed effective, R is the mean radius of curvature of the 
flange, and t is the thickness of the flange.
Figure 9.4 

C u r v e d  B e a m s 	
301
When the flange has a definite unsupported width b (gross width less web thick-
ness), the ratio of effective to actual width b′/b is a function of qb, where

For the curved beam each flange should be considered as replaced by one of corre-
sponding effective width b′, and all calculations for direct, bending, and shear stresses, 
including corrections for curvature, should be based on this transformed section.
Bleich (Ref. 10) has shown that under a straightening moment where the curvature 
is decreased, the radial components of the fiber stresses in the flanges bend both flanges 
radially away from the web, thus producing tension in the fillet between flange and 
web in a direction normal to both the circumferential and radial normal stresses dis-
cussed in the previous section. Similarly, a moment which increases the curvature 
causes both flanges to bend radially toward the web and produce compressive stresses 
in the fillet between flange and web. The nominal values of these transverse bending 
stresses ′
σ  in the fillet, without any correction for the stress concentration at the fillet, 
are given by 

′ =
σ
bσm , where σm is the circumferential bending stress at the midthick-
ness of the flange. This is less than the maximum value found in Table 9.1 and can be 
calculated by using Eq. (9.1-1). See the first example problem. The value of the coeffi-
cient b depends upon the ratio c
Rt
2/
, where c is the actual unsupported projecting 
width of the flange to either side of the web and R and t have the same meaning they 
did in the expressions for b′ and q. Values of b may be found from the following table; 
they were taken from Ref. 10, where values of b′ are also tabulated.

Derivations of expressions for b′/b and for b are also found in Ref. 29. Small differences 
in the values given in various references are due to compensations for secondary effects. 
The values given here are conservative.
In a similar way, the radial components of the circumferential normal stresses dis-
tort thin tubular cross sections of curved beams. This distortion affects both the stresses 
and deformations and is discussed in the next section.
U-Shaped Members
A U-shaped member having a semicircular inner boundary and a rectangular outer 
boundary is sometimes used as a punch or riveter frame. Such a member can usually be 
analyzed as a curved beam having a concentric outer boundary, but when the back 
thickness is large, a more accurate analysis may be necessary. In Ref. 11 are presented 

302	
C h a p t e r  N i n e
the results of a photoelastic stress analysis of such members in which the effects of 
variations in the several dimensions were determined. See case 23, Table 17.1.
Deflections
If a sharply curved beam is only a small portion of a larger structure, the contribution 
to deflection made by the curved portion can best be calculated by using the stresses at 
the inner and outer surfaces to calculate strains and the strains then used to determine 
the rotations of the plane sections. If the structure is made up primarily of a sharply 
curved beam or a combination of such beams, then refer to the next section.
9.2  Deflection of Curved Beams
Deflections of curved beams can generally be found most easily by applying an 
energy method such as Castigliano’s second theorem. One such expression is given 
by Eq. (8.1-7). The proper expression to use for the complementary energy depends 
upon the degree of curvature in the beam.
Deflection of Curved Beams of Large Radius
If for a curved beam the radius of curvature is large enough such that Eqs. (8.1-1) and 
(8.1-2) are acceptable, i.e., the radius of curvature is greater than 10 times the depth, 
then the stress distribution across the depth of the beam is very nearly linear and the 
complementary energy of flexure is given with sufficient accuracy by Eq. (8.1-3). If, in 
addition, the angular span is great enough such that deformations due to axial stress 
from the normal force N and the shear stresses due to transverse shear V can be 
neglected, deflections can be obtained by applying Eqs. (8.1-3) and (8.1-7) and rotations 
by Eq. (8.1-8). The following example shows how this is done.
Example  Figure 9.5 represents a slender uniform bar curved to form the quadrant of a circle; it is 
fixed at the lower end and at the upper end is loaded by a vertical force V, a horizontal force H, and a 
couple M0. It is desired to find the vertical deflection δy, the horizontal deflection δx, and the rotation 
θ of the upper end.

Distortion of Tubular Sections
In curved beams of thin tubular section, the distortion of the cross section produced by 
the radial components of the fiber stresses reduces both the strength and stiffness. If the 
beam curvature is not so sharp as to make Eqs. (8.1-1) and (8.1-4) inapplicable, the effect 
of this distortion of the section can be taken into account as follows.

The preceding formulas for circular sections are from von Kármán (Ref. 4); the 
formulas for square sections are from Timoshenko (Ref. 5), who also gives formulas for 
rectangular sections.
Extensive analyses have been made for thin-walled pipe elbows with sharp curva-
tures for which the equations given above do not apply directly. Loadings may be in-
plane, out-of-plane, or in various combinations (Ref. 8). Internal pressure increases and 
external pressure decreases pipe-bend stiffness. To determine ultimate load capacities 
of pipe bends or similar thin shells, elastic-plastic analyses, studies of the several modes 
of instability, and the stabilizing effects of flanges and the piping attached to the elbows 
are some of the many subjects presented in published works. Bushnell (Ref. 7) included 
an extensive list of references. Using numerical results from computer codes, graphs of 
stress indices and flexibility factors provide design data (Refs. 7, 19, and 34).
Deflection of Curved Beams of Small Radius
For a sharply curved beam, i.e., the radius of curvature is less than 10 times the depth, 
the stress distribution is not linear across the depth. The expression for the complemen-
tary energy of flexure is given by

where A is the cross-sectional area, E is the modulus of elasticity, and e is the distance 
from the centroidal axis to the neutral axis as given in Table 9.1. The differential change 
in angle dx is the same as is used in the previous example. See Fig. 9.1. Also keep clearly 
in mind that the bending in the plane of the curvature must be about a principal axis or 
the restraints described in the first paragraph of Sec. 9.1 must be present. 
For all cross sections the value of the product AeR approaches the value of the 
moment of inertia I when the radius of curvature becomes greater than 10 times the 
depth. This is seen clearly in the following table where values of the ratio AeR I
/  are 
given for several sections and curvatures.

For curved beams of large radius the effect on deflections of the shear stresses due to V 
and the circumferential normal stresses due to N were small unless the length was 
small. For sharply curved beams the effects of these stresses must be considered. Only 
the effects of the radial stresses σr will be neglected. The expression for the complemen-
tary energy including all but the radial stresses is given by

where all the quantities are defined in the notation at the beginning of Table 9.2.
The last term, hereafter referred to as the coupling term, involves the complemen-
tary energy developed from coupling the strains from the bending moment M and the 
normal force N. A positive bending moment M produces a negative strain at the posi-
tion of the centroidal axis in a curved beam, and the resultant normal force N passes 
through the centroid. Reasons have been given for and against including the coupling 
term in attempts to improve the accuracy of calculated deformations (see Refs. 3 and 29). 
Ken Tepper, Ref. 30, called attention to the importance of the coupling term for sharply 
curved beams. The equations in Tables 9.2 and 9.3 have been modified and now include 
the effect of the coupling term. With this change, the formulas given in Tables 9.2 and 
9.3 for the indeterminate reactions and for the deformations are no longer limited to 
thin rings and arches but can be used as well for thick rings and arches. As before, for 
thin rings and arches a and b can be set to zero with little error.
To summarize this discussion and its application to the formulas in Tables 9.2 and 
9.3, one can place a given curved beam into one of three categories: a thin ring, a mod-
erately thick ring, and a very thick or sharply curved ring. The boundaries between 
these categories depend upon the R d
/  ratio and the shape of the cross section. Refer-
ence to the preceding tabulation of the ratio AeR I
/  will be helpful.
For thin rings the effect of normal stress due to N and shear stress due to V can be 
neglected, i.e., set a and b equal to zero. For moderately thick rings and arches use the 
equations as they are given in Tables 9.2 and 9.3. For thick rings and arches replace the 
moment of inertia I with the product AeR in all equations including those for a and b. 
To illustrate the accuracy of this approach, the previous example problem will be 
repeated but for a thick ring of rectangular cross section. The rectangular cross section 
was chosen because a solution can be obtained by using the theory of elasticity with 
which to compare and evaluate the results. 
Example  Figure 9.6 represents a thick uniform bar of rectangular cross section having a curved 
centroidal surface of radius R. It is fixed at the lower end, and the upper end is loaded by a vertical 
force V, a horizontal force H, and a couple Mo. It is desired to find the vertical deflection δy, the horizontal 
deflection δx, and the rotation θ of the upper end. Note that the deflections δy and δx are the values at 
the free end and at the radial position R at which the load H is applied.

If reasonable errors can be tolerated, the strength-of-materials solutions are very acceptable when 
proper recognition of thick and thin beams is given.
Second Solution  Table 9.3 is designed to enable one to take any angular span 2θ and any single load 
or combination of loads and find the necessary indeterminate reactions and the desired deflections. 
To demonstrate this use of Table 9.3 in this example the deflection δx will be found due to a load H. 
Use case 12, with load terms from case 5d and with θ
π

π
=

This expression for δx is the same as the one derived directly from Castigliano’s theorem. For angular 
spans of 90° or 180° the direct derivation is not difficult, but for odd-angle spans the use of the 
equations in Table 9.3 is recommended.
The use of the equations in Table 9.3 is also recommended when deflections are desired 
at positions other than the load point. For example, assume the deflections of the midspan of 
this arch are desired when it is loaded with the end load H as shown in Fig. 9.7(a). To do this, 
isolate the span from B to C and find the loads H

Deflection of Curved Beams of Variable Cross Section and/or Radius
None of the tabulated formulas applies when either the cross section or the radius of 
curvature varies along the span. The use of Eqs. (9.2-1) and (9.2-2), or of comparable 
expressions for thin curved beams, with numerical integration carried out for a finite 
number of elements along the span, provides an effective means of solving these prob-
lems. This is best shown by example. 
Example  A rectangular beam of constant thickness and a depth varying linearly along the length is 
bent such that the centroidal surface follows the curve x
y
= 0 25

.
 as shown in Fig. 9.8. The vertical 
deflection at the loaded end is desired. To keep the use of specific dimensions to a minimum let the 
depth of the curved beam at the fixed end = 1 0
. , the thickness = 0 5
. , and the horizontal location of 
the load P = 1 0
. , The beam will be subdivided into eight segments, each spanning 0.25 units in the

spans where moments are larger and curvatures are sharper. The numerical calculations are also easier. 
Use will be made of the following expressions in order to provide the tabulated information from 
which the needed summation can be found. Note that yi and xi are used here as the y and x positions

obtained for the load point a vertically downward deflection of 72.4 units and a horizontal deflection 
of 88.3 units. The 22 elements he used were nine-node, quadratic displacement, Lagrange elements. 
The reader is invited to apply a horizontal dummy load and verify the horizontal deflection.
9.3  Circular Rings and Arches
In large pipelines, tanks, aircraft, and submarines the circular ring is an important struc-
tural element, and for correct design it is often necessary to calculate the stresses and 
deflections produced in such a ring under various conditions of loading and support. The 
circular arch of uniform section is often employed in buildings, bridges, and machinery. 
Rings
A closed circular ring may be regarded as a statically indeterminate beam and analyzed as 
such by the use of Castigliano’s second theorem. In Table 9.2 are given formulas thus 
derived for the bending moments, tensions, shears, horizontal and vertical deflections, 
and rotations of the load point in the plane of the ring for various loads and supports. 
By superposition, these formulas can be combined so as to cover almost any condition 
of loading and support likely to occur.

C u r v e d  B e a m s 	
311
The ring formulas are based on the following assumptions: (1) The ring is of uni-
form cross section and has symmetry about the plane of curvature. An exception to 
this requirement of symmetry can be made if moment restraints are provided to pre-
vent rotation of each cross section out of its plane of curvature. Lacking the plane of 
symmetry and any external constraints, out-of-plane deformations will accompany 
in-plane loading. Meck, in Ref. 21, derives expressions concerning the coupling of in-
plane and out-of-plane deformations of circular rings of arbitrary compact cross sec-
tion and resulting instabilities. (2) All loadings are applied at the radial position of the 
centroid of the cross section. For thin rings this is of little concern, but for radially 
thick rings a concentrated load acting in other than a radial direction and not at the 
centroidal radius must be replaced by a statically equivalent load at the centroidal 
radius and a couple. For case 15, where the loading is due to gravity or a constant 
linear acceleration, and for case 21, where the loading is due to rotation around an 
axis normal to the plane of the ring, the proper distribution of loading through the 
cross section is accounted for in the formulas. (3) It is nowhere stressed beyond the 
elastic limit. (4) It is not so severely deformed as to lose its essentially circular shape. 
(5) Its deflection is due primarily to bending, but for thicker rings the deflections due 
to deformations caused by axial tension or compression in the ring and/or by trans-
verse shear stresses in the ring may be included. To include these effects, we can 
evaluate first the coefficients a and b, the axial stress deformation factor and the trans-
verse shear deformation factor, and then the constants k1 and k2. Such corrections are 
more often necessary when composite or sandwich construction is employed. If no 
axial or shear stress corrections are desired, a and b are set equal to zero and the val-
ues of k are set equal to unity. (6) In the case of pipes acting as beams between widely 
spaced supports, the distribution of shear stress across the section of the pipe is in 
accordance with Eq. (8.1-2), and the direction of the resultant shear stress at any point 
of the cross section is tangential.
Note carefully the deformations given regarding the point or points of loading as 
compared with the deformations of the horizontal and vertical diameters. For many of 
the cases listed, the numerical values of load and deflection coefficients have been given 
for several positions of the loading. These coefficients do not include the effect of axial 
and shear deformation.
No account has been taken in Table 9.2 of the effect of radial stresses in the vicinity 
of the concentrated loads. These stresses and the local deformations they create can 
have a significant effect on overall ring deformations and peak stresses. In case 1 a refer-
ence is made to Sec. 14.3 in which thick-walled rollers or rings are loaded on the outer 
ends of a diameter. The stresses and deflections given here are different from those pre-
dicted by the equations in case 1. If a concentrated load is used only for purposes of 
superposition, as is often the case, there is no cause for concern, but if an actual applied 
load is concentrated over a small region and the ring is sharply curved with thick walls, 
then one must be aware of the possible errors.
Example 1  A pipe with a diameter of 13 ft and thickness of ½ in is supported at intervals of 44 ft by 
rings, each ring being supported at the extremities of its horizontal diameter by vertical reactions 
acting at the centroids of the ring sections. It is required to determine the bending moments in 
a ring at the bottom, sides, and top, and the maximum bending moment when the pipe is filled 
with water.

The value of 2800 lb-in is due to the small differences in large numbers used in the superposition. An 
exact solution would give zero for this value. It is apparent that at least four digits must be carried.

By applying the supporting reactions outside the center line of the ring at a distance a from the 
centroid of the section, side couples that are each equal to Wa/2 would be introduced. The effect of 
these, found by the formulas for case 3, would be to reduce the maximum moments, and it can be 
shown that the optimum condition obtains when a

Example 2  The pipe of Example 1 rests on soft ground, with which it is in contact over 150° of its 
circumference at the bottom. The supporting pressure of the soil may be assumed to be radial and uniform. 
It is required to determine the bending moment at the top and bottom and at the surface of the soil. Also 
the bending stresses at these locations and the change in the horizontal diameter must be determined.

The total change in the horizontal diameter is 20 in. It must be understood at this point that the answers 
are somewhat in error since this large a deflection does violate the assumption that the loaded ring is very 
nearly circular. This was expected when the stresses were found to be so large in such a thin pipe.
Arches
Table 9.3 gives formulas for end reactions and end deformations for circular arches of 
constant radius of curvature and constant cross section under 18 different loadings and 
with 14 combinations of end conditions. The corrections for axial stress and transverse 
shear are accomplished as they were in Table 9.2 by the use of the constants a and b. 
Once the indeterminate reactions are known, the bending moments, axial loads, and 
transverse shear forces can be found from equilibrium equations. If deformations are 
desired for points away from the ends, the unit-load method [Eq. (8.1-6)] can be used or 
the arch can be divided at the position where the deformations are desired and either 
portion analyzed again by the formulas in Table 9.3. Several examples illustrate this last 
approach. Note that in many instances the answer depends upon the difference of sim-
ilar large terms, and so appropriate attention to accuracy must be given.

Example 1  A WT4
6 5
× .  structural steel T-beam is formed in the plane of its web into a circular arch of 
50-in radius spanning a total angle of 120°. The right end is fixed, and the left end has a pin which is 
constrained to follow a horizontal slot in the support. The load is applied through a vertical bar welded 
to the beam, as shown in Fig. 9.9. Calculate the movement of the pin at the left end, the maximum 
bending stress, and the rotation of the bar at the point of attachment to the arch. 
Solution  The following material and cross-sectional properties may be used for this beam.

 in. The loading on the arch can be replaced by a concentrated moment of  
8000 lb-in and a horizontal force of 1000 lb at a position indicated by φ = 20° (0.349 rad). R = 50 in and 
θ =

60  (1.047 rad). For these loads and boundary conditions, cases 9b and 9n of Table 9.3 can be used.
Since the radius of 50 in is only a little more than 10 times the depth of 4 in, corrections for axial load 
and shear will be considered. The axial-stress deformation factor a =

To obtain the rotation of the arch at the point of attachment of the bar, we first calculate the loads on 
the portion to the right of the loading and then establish an equivalent symmetric arch (see Fig. 9.10). 
Now from cases 12a, 12b, and 12n, where θ

as follows:

We would not expect the rotation to be in the opposite direction to the applied moment, but a 
careful examination of the problem shows that the point on the arch where the bar is fastened moves

to the right 0.0128 in. Therefore, the net motion in the direction of the 1000-lb load on the end of the 
8-in bar is 0.0099 in, and so the applied load does indeed do positive work on the system.
Example 2  The deep circular arch of titanium alloy has a triangular cross section and spans 120° as 
shown in Fig. 9.11. It is driven by the central load P to produce an acceleration of 40 g. The tensile 
stress at A and the deformations at the extreme ends are required. All dimensions given and used in 
the formulas are in centimeters. 
Solution  This is a statically determinate problem, so the use of information from Table 9.3 is needed 
only to obtain the deformations. Superposing the central load and the forces needed to produce the 
acceleration on the total span can be accomplished readily by using cases 3a and 3h. This solution, 
however, will provide only the horizontal and rotational deformations of the ends. Using the symmetry 
one can also superpose the loadings from cases 12h and 12i on the left half of the arch and obtain all 
three deformations. Performing both calculations provides a useful check. All dimensions are given in 
centimeters and used with expressions from Table 9.1, case 5, to obtain the needed factors for this section.

 and, for the peak stresses,

. The titanium alloy has a modulus of elasticity of 117 GPa [

],
11 7 106 N/cm2  
a Poisson’s ratio of 0.33, and a mass density of 4470 kg/m3, or 0.00447 kg/cm3. One g of acceleration is 
9.81 m/s2, and 1 cm of arc length at the centroidal radius of 30 cm will have a volume of 150 cm3 and a 
mass of 0.6705 kg. This gives a loading parallel to the driving force P of 0.6705(40)(9.81) = 263 N/cm 
of centroidal arc length. Since this is a very sharply curved beam, R d
/ = 1, one must recognize that the 
resultant load of 263 N/cm does not act through the centroid of the cross-sectional area but instead acts 
through the mass center of the differential length. The radius to this point is given as Rcg and is found 
from the expression R

Although the values of ψ A from the two solutions check, one further step is needed to check the

Again the horizontal deflection of −0.000241 cm for the left half of the arch checks well with the value 
of −0.000482 cm for the entire arch. With the two displacements of the centroid and the rotation of 
the end cross section now known, one can easily find the displacements of any other point on the 
end cross section.

9.5  Curved Beams Loaded Normal to Plane of Curvature
This type of beam usually presents a statically indeterminate problem, the degree of 
indeterminacy depending upon the manner of loading and support. Both bending and 
twisting occur, and it is necessary to distinguish between an analysis that is applicable 
to compact or flangeless sections (circular, rectangular, etc.) in which torsion does not 
produce secondary bending and one that is applicable to flanged sections (I-beams, 
channels, etc.) in which torsion may be accompanied by such secondary bending (see 
Sec. 10.3). It is also necessary to distinguish among three types of constraints that may 
or may not occur at the supports, namely: (1) the beam is prevented from sloping, its 
horizontal axis held horizontal by a bending couple; (2) the beam is prevented from 
rolling, its vertical axis held vertical by a twisting couple; and (3) in the case of a flanged 
section, the flanges are prevented from turning about their vertical axes by horizontal 
secondary bending couples. These types of constraints will be designated here as (1) 
fixed as to slope, (2) fixed as to roll, and (3) flanges fixed.

Compact Sections
Table 9.4 treats the curved beam of uniform cross section under concentrated and 
distributed loads normal to the plane of curvature, out-of-plane concentrated bend-
ing moments, and concentrated and distributed torques. Expressions are given for 
transverse shear, bending moment, twisting moment, deflection, bending slope, and 
roll slope for 10 combinations of end conditions. To keep the presentation to a rea-
sonable size, use is made of the singularity functions discussed in detail previously, 
and an extensive list of constants and functions is given. In previous tables the rep-
resentative functional values have been given, but in Table 9.4 the value of b depends 
upon both bending and torsional properties, and so a useful set of tabular values 
would be too large to present. The curved beam or ring of circular cross section is so 
common, however, that numerical coefficients are given in the table for b = 1 3
.  which 
will apply to a solid or hollow circular cross section of material for which Poisson’s 
ratio is 0.3.
Levy (Ref. 14) has treated the closed circular ring of arbitrary compact cross section 
for six loading cases. These cases have been chosen to permit apropriate superposition 
in order to solve a large number of problems, and both isolated and distributed out-of-
plane loads are discussed. Hogan (Ref. 18) presents similar loadings and supports. In a 
similar way the information in Table 9.4 can be used by appropriate superposition to 
solve most out-of-plane loading problems on closed rings of compact cross section if 
strict attention is given to the symmetry and boundary conditions involved. Several 
simple examples of this reasoning are described in the following three cases: 
	
1.	 If a closed circular ring is supported on any number of equally spaced simple 
supports (two or more) and if identical loading on each span is symmetrically 
placed relative to the center of the span, then each span can be treated by 
boundary condition f of Table 9.4, case 1. This boundary condition has both 
ends with no deflection or slope, although they are free to roll as needed.
	
2.	 If a closed circular ring is supported on any even number of equally spaced 
simple supports and if the loading on any span is antisymmetrically placed 
relative to the center line of each span and symmetrically placed relative to each 
support, then boundary condition f can be applied to each full span. This 
problem can also be solved by applying boundary condition g to each half span. 
Boundary condition g has one end simply supported and slope-guided and the 
other end simply supported and roll-guided. 
	
3.	 If a closed circular ring is supported on any even number of equally spaced 
simple supports (four or more) and if each span is symmetrically loaded relative 
to the center of the span with adjacent spans similarly loaded in opposite 
directions, then boundary condition i can be applied to each span. This boundary 
condition has both ends simply supported and roll-guided. 
Once any indeterminate reaction forces and moments have been found and the inde-
terminate internal reactions found at at least one location in the ring, all desired internal 
bending moment, torques, and transverse shears can be found by equilibrium equations. 
If a large number of such calculations need be made, one should consider using a theo-
rem published in 1922 by Biezeno. For details of this theorem see Ref. 32. A brief illustra-
tion of this work for loads normal to the plane of the ring is given in Ref. 29.

A treatment of curved beams on elastic foundations is beyond the scope of this 
book. See Ref. 20. 
The following examples illustrate the applications of the formulas in Table 9.4 to 
both curved beams and closed rings with out-of-plane loads.
Example 1  A piece of 8-in standard pipe is used to carry water across a passageway 40 ft wide. The 
pipe must come out of a wall normal to the surface and enter normal to a parallel wall at a position 
16.56 ft down the passageway at the same elevation. To accomplish this a decision was made to bend 
the pipe into two opposite arcs of 28.28-ft radius with a total angle of 45° in each arc. If it is assumed 
that both ends are rigidly held by the walls, determine the maximum combined stress in the pipe due 
to its own weight and the weight of a full pipe of water.

 The weight of 
water in a 1-in length of pipe is 1.81 lb. Owing to the symmetry of loading it is apparent that at the 
center of the span where the two arcs meet there is neither slope nor roll. An examination of Table 9.4 
reveals that a curved beam that is fixed at the right end and roll- and slope-guided at the left end is 
not included among the 10 cases. Therefore, a solution will be carried out by considering a beam that 
is fixed at the right end and free at the left end with a uniformly distributed load over the entire span 
and both a concentrated moment and a concentrated torque on the left end. (These conditions are 
covered in cases 2a, 3a, and 4a.)

Example 2  A hollow steel rectangular beam 4 in wide, 8 in deep, and with 0.1-in wall thickness extends 
over a loading dock to be used as a crane rail. It is fixed to a warehouse wall at one end and is simply 
supported on a post at the other. The beam is curved in a horizontal plane with a radius of 15 ft and 
covers a total angular span of 60°. Calculate the torsional and bending stresses at the wall when a load 
of 3000 lb is 20° out from the wall. Neglect the weight of the beam.

Example 3  A solid round aluminum bar is in the form of a horizontal closed circular ring of 100-in 
radius resting on three equally spaced simple supports. A load of 1000 lb is placed midway between 
two supports, as shown in Fig. 9.13(a). Calculate the deflection under this load if the bar is of such 
diameter as to make the maximum normal stress due to combined bending and torsion equal to

lb  The internal bending and twisting moments are statically indeterminate, 
and so an energy solution would be appropriate. However, there are several ways that Table 9.4 can 
be used by superimposing various loadings. The method to be described here is probably the most 
straightforward.

The only difference is in the point of zero deflection. Owing to the symmetry of loading, one-half

A careful examination of the expression for M shows no maximum values except at the ends and at 
the position of the load. The torque, however, has a maximum value of 13,100 in-lb at x = 37 59

º and 
a minimum value of −8790 in-lb at x = 130 9

At the position of the load, the torque T = 8330 lb-in. Nowhere is the combined stress larger than the 
bending stress at point A. Therefore,

To obtain the deflection under the 1000-lb load in the original problem, first we must find the

 which is the downward

The use of a fictitious support, as was done in this problem at point A, is generalized for asymmetric 
loadings, both in-plane and out-of-plane, by Barber in Ref. 35.
Flanged Sections
The formulas in Table 9.4 for flangeless or compact sections apply also to flanged sec-
tions when the ends are fixed as to slope only or when fixed as to slope and roll but not 
as to flange bending and if the loads are distributed or applied only at the ends. If the 
flanges are fixed or if concentrated loads are applied within the span, the additional 
torsional stiffness contributed by the bending resistance of the flanges [warping restraint 
(see Sec. 10.3)] may appreciably affect the value and distribution of twisting and bend-
ing moments. The flange stresses caused by the secondary bending or warping may 
exceed the primary bending stresses. References 15–17 and 22 show methods of solu-
tion and give some numerical solutions for simple concentrated loads on curved 
I-beams with both ends fixed completely. Brookhart (Ref. 22) also includes results for 
additional boundary conditions and uniformly distributed loads. Results are compared 
with cases where the warping restraint was not considered.
Dabrowski (Ref. 23) gives a thorough presentation of the theory of curved thin-
walled beams and works out many examples including multispan beams and beams 
with open cross sections, closed cross sections, and cross sections which contain both 
open and closed elements; an extensive bibliography is included. Vlasov (Ref. 27) also 
gives a very thorough derivation and discusses, among many other topics, vibrations, 
stability, laterally braced beams of open cross section, and thermal stresses. He also 
examines the corrections necessary to account for shear deformation in flanges being 
warped. Verden (Ref. 24) is primarily concerned with multispan curved beams and 
works out many examples. Sawko and Cope (Ref. 25) and Meyer (Ref. 26) apply finite-
element analysis to curved box girder bridges.

9.  Segment of a solid circle, 
base inward
Note: R, c, e/c, ki, and ko are 
all independent of the width 
of the segment provided 
all horizontal elements of 
the segment change width 
proportionately. Therefore 
to use these expressions 
for a segment of an ellipse, 
find the circle which has the 
same radial dimensions Rx , 
ri , and d and evaluate e/c, ki , 
and ko which have the same 
values for both the circle and 
ellipse. To find dA/r for the 
ellipse, multiply the value of 
dA/r for the circle by the ratio 
of the horizontal to vertical 
semiaxes for the ellipse. See 
the example.

∆DV and ∆DH are changes in the vertical and horizontal diameters, respectively, and an increase is positive. ∆L is the change in the lower half of the vertical diameter or the vertical 
motion relative to point C of a line connecting points B and D on the ring. Similarly ∆LW is the vertical motion relative to point C of a horizontal line connecting the load points on the 
ring. ∆LWH is the change in length of a horizontal line connecting the load points on the ring. ψ is the angular rotation (radians) of the load point in the plane of the ring and is positive in 
the direction of positive θ. For the distributed loadings the load points just referred to are the points where the distributed loading starts, i.e., the position located by the angle θ. The 
reference to points A, B, and C and to the diameters refer to positions on a circle of radius R passing through the centroids of the several sections, i.e., diameter = 2R. It is important 
to consider this when dealing with thick rings. Similarly, all concentrated and distributed loadings are assumed to be applied at the radial position of the centroid with the exception of 
the cases where the ring is loaded by its own weight or by dynamic loading, cases 15 and 21. In these two cases the actual radial distribution of load is considered. If the loading is on 
the outer or inner surfaces of thick rings, an equivalent loading at the centroidal radius R must be used. See the examples to determine how this might be accomplished.
The hoop-stress deformation factor is α = I/AR2 for thin rings or a = e/R  for thick rings. The transverse (radial) shear deformation factor is β = FE

Note: Due to symmetry in most of the cases presented, the loads beyond 180° are not included in the load terms. Only for cases 16, 
17, and 19 should the equations for M, N, and V be used beyond 180°.
Note: The use of the bracket x - θ
0 is explained on page 159 and has a value of zero unless x > θ.

Notation: W = load (force); w = unit load (force per unit of circumferential length); Mo = applied couple (force-length). θo = externally created concentrated angular displacement (radians); 
Do = externally created concentrated radial displacement; T - To = uniform temperature rise (degrees); T1 and T2 = temperatures on outside and inside, respectively (degrees). HA and HB 
are the horizontal end reactions at the left and right, respectively, and are positive to the left; VA and VB are the vertical end reactions at the left and right ends, respectively, and are 
positive upward; MA and MB are the reaction moments at the left and right, respectively, and are positive clockwise. E = modulus of elasticity (force per unit area); n = Poisson’s ratio;  
A is the cross-sectional area; R is the radius at the centroid at the cross section; I = area moment of inertia of arch cross section about the principal axis perpendicular to the plane 
of the arch. [Note that for a wide curved plate or a sector of a cylinder, a representative segment of unit axial length may be used by replacing EI by Et3/12(1 - n2).] e is the positive 
distance measured radially inward from the centroidal axis of the cross section to the neutral axis of pure bending (see Sec. 9.1). θ (radians) is one-half of the total subtended angle 
of the arch and is limited to the range zero to p. For an angle θ close to zero, round-off errors may cause troubles; for an angle θ close to p, the possibility of static or elastic instability 
must be considered. Deformations have been assumed small enough so as to not affect the expressions for the internal bending moments, radial shear, and circumferential normal 
forces. Answers should be examined to be sure that such is the case before accepting them. φ (radians) is the angle measured counterclockwise from the midspan of the arch to the 
position of a concentrated load or the start of a distributed load. s

The references to end points A and B refer to positions on a circle of radius R passing through the centroids of the several sections. It is important to note this carefully when dealing 
with thick rings. Similarly, all concentrated and distributed loadings are assumed to be applied at the radial position of the centroid with the exception of cases 1 and 5, subcases h and 
i where the ring is loaded by its own weight or by a constant linear acceleration. In these two cases the actual radial distribution of load is considered. If the loading is on the outer or 
inner surfaces of thick rings, a statically equivalent loading at the centroidal radius R must be used. See examples to determine how this might be accomplished.
The hoop-stress deformation factor is a = I/AR2 for thin rings or a = e/R for thick rings. The transverse- (radial-) shear deformation factor is b = FE

Table 9.3  Reaction and Deformation Formulas for Circular Arches (Continued )

370
Notation: W = applied load normal to the plane of curvature (force); Mo = applied bending moment in a plane tangent to the curved axis of the beam (force-length); To = applied twisting 
moment in a plane normal to the curved axis of the beam (force-length); w = distributed load (force per unit length); to = distributed twisting moment (force-length per unit length); 
VA = reaction force, MA = reaction bending moment, TA = reaction twisting moment, yA = deflection normal to the plane of curvature, ΘA = slope of the beam axis in the plane of the 
moment MA, and ψA = roll of the beam cross section in the plane of the twisting moment TA, all at the left end of the beam. Similarly, VB, MB, TB, yB, ΘB, and ψB are the reactions and 
displacements at the right end; V, M, T, y, Θ, and ψ are internal shear forces, moments, and displacements at an angular position x rad from the left end. All loads and reactions are 
positive as shown in the diagram; y is positive upward; Θ is positive when y increases as x increases; and ψ is positive in the direction of T.
R = radius of curvature of the beam axis (length); E = modulus of elasticity (force per unit area); I = area moment of inertia about the bending axis (length to the fourth power) (note 
that this must be a principal axis of the beam cross section); G = modulus of rigidity (force per unit area); ν = Poisson’s ratio; K = torsional stiffness constant of the cross section 
(length to the fourth power) (see page 402); θ = angle in radians from the left end to the position of the loading; φ = angle (radians) subtended by the entire span of the curved beam. 
See page 159 for a definition of the term 〈x - θ〉n. 
The following constants and functions are hereby defined to permit condensing the tabulated formulas which follow. β = E I/GK.

Torsion
10.1  Straight Bars of Uniform Circular  
Section under Pure Torsion
The formulas in this section are based on the following assumptions: (1) The bar is 
straight, of uniform circular section (solid or concentrically hollow), and of homoge-
neous isotropic material; (2) the bar is loaded only by equal and opposite twisting cou-
ples, which are applied at its ends in planes normal to its axis; and (3) the bar is not 
stressed beyond the elastic limit.
Behavior
The bar twists, each section rotating about the longitudinal axis. Plane sections remain 
plane, and radii remain straight. There is at any point a shear stress t  on the plane of the 
section; the magnitude of this stress is proportional to the distance from the center of 
the section, and its direction is perpendicular to the radius drawn through the point. 
Accompanying this shear stress there is an equal longitudinal shear stress on a radial 
plane and equal tensile and compressive stresses st  and sc  at 45° (see Sec. 7.5). The 
deformation and stresses described are represented in Fig. 10.1.
In addition to these deformations and stresses, there is some longitudinal strain and 
stress. A solid circular cylinder wants to lengthen under twist, as shown experimentally by 
Poynting (Ref. 26). In any event, for elastic loading of metallic circular bars, neither longitu-
dinal deformation nor stress is likely to be large enough to have engineering significance.
Formulas
Let T = twisting moment, l = length of the member, r = outer radius of the section, J = 
polar moment of inertia of the section, ρ = radial distance from the center of the section 
to any point q, t  = the shear stress, q  = angle of twist (radians), G = modulus of rigidity 
of the material, and U = strain energy. Then

By substituting for J in Eqs. (10.1-1) and (10.1-3) its value 2I from Table A.1, the for-
mulas for cases 1 and 10 in Table 10.1 are readily obtained. If a solid or hollow circular 
shaft has a slight taper, the formulas above for shear stress are sufficiently accurate and 
the expressions for q  and U can be modified to apply to a differential length by replac-
ing l by dl. If the change in section is abrupt, as at a shoulder with a small fillet, the 
maximum stress should be found by the use of a suitable factor of stress concentration 
Kt. Values of Kt are given in Table 17.1.
10.2  Bars of Noncircular Uniform Section under Pure Torsion
The formulas of this section are based on the same assumptions as those of Sec. 10.1 
except that the cross section of the bar is not circular. It is important to note that the 
condition of loading implies that the end sections of the bar are free to warp, there being 
no constraining forces to hold them in their respective planes.
Behavior
The bar twists, each section rotating about its torsional center. Sections do not remain 
plane, but warp, and some radial lines through the torsional center do not remain 
straight. The distribution of shear stress on the section is not necessarily linear, and the 
direction of the shear stress is not necessarily normal to a radius.
Formulas
The torsional stiffness of the bar can be expressed by the general equations

or
	
(10.2-1)
where K is a factor dependent on the form and dimensions of the cross section. For a 
circular section K is the polar moment of inertia J [Eq. (10.1-1)] for other sections K is less 
than J and may be only a very small fraction of J. The maximum stress is a function of 
the twisting moment and of the form and dimensions of the cross section. In Table 10.1, 
formulas are given for K and for max t for a variety of sections. The formulas for cases 
1–3, 5, 10, and 12 are based on rigorous mathematical analysis. The equations for case 4 
are given in a simplified form involving an approximation, with a resulting error not 
greater than 4%. The K formulas for cases 13–21 and the stress formulas for cases 13–18 
are based on mathematical analysis but are approximate (Ref. 2); their accuracy depends 
upon how nearly the actual section conforms to the assumptions indicated as to form. 
The K formulas for cases 22–26 and the stress formulas for cases 19–26 are based on the 
membrane analogy and are to be regarded as reasonably close approximations giving 
results that are rarely as much as 10% in error (Refs. 2–4 and 11).
It will be noted that formulas for K in cases 23–26 are based on the assumption of 
uniform flange thickness. For slightly tapering flanges, D should be taken as the 
Figure 10.1

diameter of the largest circle that can be inscribed in the actual section, and b as the 
average flange thickness. For sharply tapering flanges the method described by Grif-
fith (Ref. 3) may be used. Charts relating especially to structural H- and I-sections are 
in Ref. 11.
Cases 7, 9, and 27–35 present the results of curve fitting to data from Isakower, 
Refs.  12 and 13. These data were obtained from running a computer code CLYDE 
(Ref. 14) based on a finite-difference solution using central differences with a constant-
size square mesh. Reference 12 also suggests an extension of this work to include sec-
tions containing hollows. For some simple concentric hollows the results of solutions in 
Table 10.1 can be superposed to obtain closely approximate solutions if certain limita-
tions are observed. See the examples at the end of this section.
The formulas of Table 10.1 make possible the calculation of the strength and stiffness 
of a bar of almost any form, but an understanding of the membrane analogy (Sec. 6.4) 
makes it possible to draw certain conclusions as to the comparative torsional properties of 
different sections by simply visualizing the bubbles that would be formed over holes of 
corresponding size and shape. From the volume relationship, it can be seen that of two 
sections having the same area, the one more nearly circular is the stiffer, and that although 
any extension whatever of the section increases its torsional stiffness, narrow outstand-
ing flanges and similar protrusions have little effect. It is also apparent that any member 
having a narrow section, such as a thin plate, has practically the same torsional stiffness 
when flat as when bent into the form of an open tube or into channel or angle section.
From the slope relationship it can be seen that the greatest stresses (slopes) in a 
given section occur at the boundary adjacent to the thicker portions, and that the stresses 
are very low at the ends of outstanding flanges or protruding corners and very high at 
points where the boundary is sharply concave. Therefore, a longitudinal slot or groove 
that is sharp at the bottom or narrow will cause high local stresses, and if it is deep will 
greatly reduce the torsional stiffness of the member. The direction of the shear stresses 
at any point is along the contour of the bubble surface at the corresponding point, and 
at points corresponding to local maximum and minimum elevations of the bubble hav-
ing zero slopes in all directions the shear stress is zero. Therefore, there may be several 
points of zero shear stress in a section. Thus for an I-section, there are high points of 
zero slope at the center of the largest inscribed circles (at the junction of web and flanges) 
and a low point of zero slope at the center of the web, and eight points of zero slope at 
the external corners. At these points in the section the shear stress is zero.
The preceding generalizations apply to solid sections, but it is possible to make 
somewhat similar generalizations concerning hollow or tubular sections from the for-
mulas given for cases 10–16. These formulas show that the strength and stiffness of a 
hollow section depend largely upon the area inclosed by the median boundary. For this 
reason a circular tube is stiffer and stronger than one of any other form, and the more 
nearly the form of any hollow section approaches the circular, the greater will be its 
strength and stiffness. It is also apparent from the formulas for strength that even a local 
reduction in the thickness of the wall of a tube, such as would be caused by a longitudi-
nal groove, may greatly increase the maximum shear stress, though if the groove is 
narrow the effect on stiffness will be small.
The torsional strengths and stiffnesses of thin-walled multicelled structures such as 
airplane wings and boat hulls can be calculated by the same procedures as for single-
celled sections. The added relationships needed are developed from the fact that all 
cells twist at the same angular rate at a given section (Ref. 1).

Example 1  It is required to compare the strength and stiffness of a circular steel tube, 4 in outside 
diameter and 5
32  in thick, with the strength and stiffness of the same tube after it has been split by 
cutting full length along an element. No warping restraint is provided.
Solution  The strengths will be compared by comparing the twisting moments required to produce 
the same stress; the stiffnesses will be compared by comparing the values of K.

The closed section is therefore more than 400 times as stiff as the open section and more than 30 times 
as strong.
Example 2  It is required to determine the angle through which an airplane-wing spar of spruce, 8 ft long 
and having the section shown in Fig. 10.2, would be twisted by end torques of 500 lb-in, and to find the 
maximum resulting stress. For the material in question, G = 100,000 lb/in2 and E = 1,500,000 lb/in2. 
Solution  All relevant dimensions are shown in Fig. 10.2, with notation corresponding to that used in the 
formulas. The first step is to compute K by the formulas given for case 26 (Table 10.1), and we have

Example 3  For each of the three cross sections shown in Fig. 10.3, determine the numerical relationships 
between torque and maximum shear stress and between torque and rate of twist.
Solution  To illustrate the method of solution, superposition will be used for section A despite the 
availability of a solution from case 10 of Table 10.1. For a shaft, torque and angle of twist are related 
in the same way that a soap-film volume under the film is related to the pressure which inflates the 
film, provided the same cross section is used for each. See the discussion of the membrane analogy in 
Sec. 6.4. One can imagine then a soap film blown over a circular hole of radius Ro and then imagine 
the removal of that portion of the volume extending above the level of the soap film for which the 
radius is Ri. Doing the equivalent operation with the shaft assumes that the rate of twist is q/L and

Case 10 for the hollow round section gives this same relationship. Slicing off the top of the soap film 
would not change the maximum slope of the bubble which is present along the outer radius. Thus 
the maximum shear stress on the hollow shaft with torque TR is the same as the shear stress produced 
on a solid round section by the torque To. From case 1

It is important to note that the exact answer was obtained because there was a concentric circular 
contour line on the soap film blown over the large hole. Had the hole in the shaft been slightly off 
center, none of the equivalent contour lines on the soap film would have been absolutely circular and 
the answers just obtained would be slightly in error.
Now apply this same technique to the hollow shaft with section B having a 12-spline internal hole. 
To solve this case exactly, one would need to find a contour line on the equivalent soap film blown over 
the circular hole of radius Ro. Such a contour does not exist, but it can be created as discussed in Sec. 6.4. 
Imagine a massless fine wire bent into the shape of the internal spline in a single plane and allow 
this wire to float at a constant elevation in the soap film in equilibrium with the surface tension. The 
volume which is to be removed from the soap film is now well-defined and will be worked out using 
cases 1 and 33, but the unanswered question is what the addition of the wire did to the total volume 
of the original soap film. It is changed by a small amount. This information comes from Ref. 12, where 
Isakower shows numerical solutions to some problems with internal noncircular holes. The amount 
of the error depends upon the number and shape of the splines and upon how close they come to the 
outer boundary of the shaft. Ignoring these errors, the solution can be carried out as before.
The torque carried by the solid round shaft is the same as for section A. For the 12-point internal 
spline, one needs to use case 33 three times since case 33 carries only four splines and then remove 
the extra material added by using case 1 twice for the material internal to the splines. For case 33 let

Finding the maximum shear stress is a more difficult task for this cross section. If, as stated 
before, the total volume of the original soap film is changed a small amount when the spline-shaped 
wire is inserted, one might expect the meridional slope of the soap film at the outer edge and the 
corresponding stress at the outer surface of the shaft A to change slightly. However, if one ignores this 
effect, this shear stress can be found as (case 1)

For this section, however, there is a possibility that the maximum shear stress and maximum slope 
of soap film will be bound at the outer edge of an internal spline. No value for this is known, but it 
would be close to the maximum shear stress on the inner edge of the spline for the material removed.

Using the same arguments already presented for the first two sections, one can find KR for section C

Again one would expect the maximum shear stress to be somewhat larger with twelve splines than 
with four and again the stress concentrations in the corners of the splines must be considered.
10.3  Effect of End Constraint
It was pointed out in Sec. 10.2 that when noncircular bars are twisted, the sections do 
not remain plane but warp, and that the formulas of Table 10.1 are based on the assump-
tion that this warping is not prevented. If one or both ends of a bar are so fixed that 
warping is prevented, or if the torque is applied to a section other than at the ends of a 
bar, the stresses and the angle of twist produced by the given torque are affected. In 
compact sections the effect is slight, but in the case of open thin-walled sections the 
effect may be considerable.
Behavior
To visualize the additional support created by warping restraint, consider a very thin 
rectangular cross section and an I-beam having the same thickness and the same total 
cross-sectional area as the rectangle. With no warping restraint the two sections will have 
essentially the same stiffness factor K (see Table 10.1, cases 4 and 26). With warping 

408	
C h a p t e r  T e n
restraint provided at one end of the bar, the rectangle will be stiffened very little but the 
built-in flanges of the I-beam act as cantilever beams. The shear forces developed in the 
flanges as a result of the bending of these cantilevers will assist the torsional shear 
stresses in carrying the applied torque and greatly increase the stiffness of the bar unless 
the length is very great.
Formulas
Table 10.2 gives formulas for the warping stiffness factor Cw  , the torsional stiffness fac-
tor K, the location of the shear center, the magnitudes and locations within the cross 
section of the maximum shear stresses due to simple torsion, the maximum shear 
stresses due to warping, and the maximum bending stresses due to warping. All the 
cross sections listed are assumed to have thin walls and the same thickness throughout 
the section unless otherwise indicated.
Table 10.3 provides the expressions necessary to evaluate the angle of rotation q and 
the first three derivatives of q along the span for a variety of loadings and boundary 
restraints. The formulas in this table are based on deformations from bending stresses 
in the thin-walled open cross sections due to warping restraint and consequently, since 
the transverse shear deformations of the beam action are neglected, are not applicable 
to cases where the torsion member is short or where the torsional loading is applied 
close to a support which provides warping restraint.
In a study of the effect on seven cross sections, all of which were approximately 
4 in deep and had walls approximately 0.1 in thick, Schwabenlender (Ref. 28) tested 
them with one end fixed and the other end free to twist but not warp with the torsional 
loading applied to the latter end. He found that the effect of the transverse shear stress 
noticeably reduced the torsional stiffness of cross sections such as those shown in 
Table 10.2, cases 1 and 6–8, when the length was less than six times the depth; for sec-
tions such as those in cases 2–5 (Table 10.2), the effect became appreciable at even 
greater lengths. To establish an absolute maximum torsional stiffness constant we 
note that for any cross section, when the length approaches zero, the effective tor-
sional stiffness constant 
′
K  cannot exceed J, the polar moment of inertia, where 
J
I
I

=

 for axes through the centroid of the cross section. (Example 1 illustrates this 
last condition.)
Reference 19 gives formulas and graphs for the angle of rotation and the first three 
derivatives for 12 cases of torsional loading of open cross sections. Payne (Ref. 15) 
gives the solution for a box girder that is fixed at one end and has a torque applied to 
the other. (This solution was also presented in detail in the fourth edition of this book.) 
Chu (Ref. 29) and Vlasov (Ref. 30) discuss solutions for cross sections with both open 
and closed parts. Kollbrunner and Basler (Ref. 31) discuss the warping of continuous 
beams and consider the multicellular box section, among other cross sections.
Example 1  A steel torsion member has a cross section in the form of a twin channel with flanges inward 
as dimensioned in Fig. 10.4. Both ends of this channel are rigidly welded to massive steel blocks to 
provide full warping restraint. A torsional load is to be applied to one end block while the other is 
fixed. Determine the angle of twist at the loaded end for an applied torque of 1000 lb-in for lengths of 
100, 50, 25, and 10 in. Assume E = 30 106
(

in4  The calculated stiffness 
′ =

 at l = 10  in is beyond the limiting value of 7.84, and so it is known to be in error because 
shear deformation was not included; therefore we would suspect the value of 
′ =
K
1 433
.
 at l = 25  in 
as well. Indeed, Schwabenlender (Ref. 28) found that for a similar cross section the effect of shear 
deformation in the flanges reduced the stiffness by approximately 25% at a length of 25 in and by 
more than 60% at a length of 10 in.
Example 2  A small cantilever crane rolls along a track welded from three pieces of 0.3-in-thick steel, 
as shown in Fig. 10.5. The 20-ft-long track is solidly welded to a rigid foundation at the right end and 
simply supported 4 ft from the left end, which is free. The simple support also provides resistance to 
rotation about the beam axis but provides no restraint against warping or rotation in horizontal and 
vertical planes containing the axis.
The crane weighs 300 lb and has a center of gravity which is 20 in out from the web of the track. 
A load of 200 lb is carried at the end of the crane 60 in from the web. It is desired to determine the 
maximum flexure stress and the maximum shear stress in the track and also the angle of inclination 
of the crane when it is located 8 ft from the welded end of the track.
Solution  The loading will be considered in two stages. First consider a vertical load of 500 lb acting 8 ft 
from the fixed end of a 16-ft beam fixed at one end and simply supported at the other. The following 
constants are needed:

The second portion of the solution considers a beam fixed at the right end against both rotation

torque Tc, which makes the angle of rotation zero at that point, and a known torque of 300(20) + 
200(60) = 18,000 lb-in at a point 12 ft from the left end. Again evaluate the following constants; assume

10.4   Effect of Longitudinal Stresses
It was pointed out in Sec. 10.1 that the elongation of the outer fibers consequent upon 
twist caused longitudinal stresses, but that in a bar of circular section these stresses 
were negligible. In a flexible bar, the section of which comprises one or more narrow 
rectangles, the stresses in the longitudinal fibers may become large; and since after 
twisting these fibers are inclined, the stresses in them have components, normal to the 
axis of twist, which contribute to the torsional resistance of the member.
The stress in the longitudinal fibers of a thin twisted strip and the effect of these 
stresses on torsional stiffness have been considered by Timoshenko (Ref. 5), Green 
(Ref. 6), Cook and Young (Ref. 1), and others. The following formulas apply to this 

414	
C h a p t e r  T e n
case: Let 2a = width of strip; 2b = thickness of strip; t, st ,  and sc  = maximum shear, 
maximum tensile, and maximum compressive stress due to twisting, respectively; T = 
applied twisting moment; and q/l =  angle of twist per unit length. Then

(10.4-3)
The first term on the right side of Eq. (10.4-3), KG
l
q/ ,  represents the part of the total 
applied torque T that is resisted by torsional shear; the second term represents the part 
that is resisted by the tensile stresses in the (helical) longitudinal fibers. It can be seen 
that this second part is small for small angles of twist but increases rapidly as 
q/l  increases.
To find the stresses produced by a given torque T, first the value of q/l  is found by 
Eq. (10.4-3), taking K as given for Table 10.1, case 4. Then t  is found by the stress for-
mula for case 4, taking KG
l
q/  for the twisting moment. Finally st and sc can be found 
by Eqs. (10.4-1) and (10.4-2).
This stiffening and strengthening effect of induced longitudinal stress will manifest 
itself in any bar having a section composed of narrow rectangles, such as a I-, T-, or 
channel, provided that the parts are so thin as to permit a large unit twist without over-
stressing. At the same time the accompanying longitudinal compression [Eq. (10.4-2)] 
may cause failure through elastic instability (see Table 15.1).
If a thin strip of width a and maximum thickness b is initially twisted (as by cold 
working) to a helical angle b,  then there is an initial stiffening effect in torsion that can 
be expressed by the ratio of effective K to nominal K (as given in Table 10.3):

If a bar of any cross section is independently loaded in tension, then the correspond-
ing longitudinal tensile stress st similarly will provide a resisting torque that again 
depends on the angle of twist, and the total applied torque corresponding to any angle 
of twist q is T

Bending also influences the torsional stiffness of a rod unless the cross section has 
(1) two axes of symmetry, (2) point symmetry, or (3) one axis of symmetry that is normal 
to the plane of bending. (The influences of longitudinal loading and bending are dis-
cussed in Ref. 23.)

10.5  Ultimate Strength of Bars in Torsion
When twisted to failure, bars of ductile material usually break in shear, the surface of 
fracture being normal to the axis and practically flat. Bars of brittle material usually 
break in tension, the surface of fracture being helicoidal.
Circular Sections
The formulas of Sec. 10.1 apply only when the maximum stress does not exceed the 
elastic limit. If Eq. (10.1-3) is used with T equal to the twisting moment at failure, a ficti-
tious value of t  is obtained, which is called the modulus of rupture in torsion and which 
for convenience will be denoted here by  ′t .  For solid bars of steel,  ′t  slightly exceeds 
the ultimate tensile strength when the length is only about twice the diameter but drops 
to about 80% of the tensile strength when the length becomes 25 times the diameter. For 
solid bars of aluminum,  ′t  is about 90% of the tensile strength.
For tubes, the modulus of rupture decreases with the ratio of diameter D to wall 
thickness t. Younger (Ref. 7) gives the following approximate formula, applicable to 
tubes of steel and aluminum:
	
′ =
′

where  ′t  is the modulus of rupture in torsion of the tube and  ′t0  is the modulus of rup-
ture in torsion of a solid circular bar of the same material. (Curves giving  ′t  as a func-
tion of D/t for various steels and light alloys may be found in Ref. 18.)
10.6  Torsion of Curved Bars; Helical Springs
The formulas of Secs. 10.1 and 10.2 can be applied to slightly curved bars without 
significant error, but for sharply curved bars, such as helical springs, account must be 
taken of the influence of curvature and slope. Among others, Wahl (Ref. 8) and Ancker 
and Goodier (Ref. 24) have discussed this problem, and the former presents charts 
which greatly facilitate the calculation of stress and deflection for springs of 
non-circular section. Of the following formulas cited, those for round wire were taken 
from Ref. 24, and those for square and rectangular wire from Ref. 8 (with some changes 
of notation).
Let R =  radius of coil measured from spring axis to center of section (Fig. 10.6), d = 
diameter of circular section, 2b =  thickness of square section, P =  load (either tensile or 
compressive), n =  number of active turns in spring, a =  pitch angle of spring,  f =  total 
stretch or shortening of spring, and t =  maximum shear stress produced. Then for a 
spring of circular wire,

It should be noted that in each of these cases the maximum stress is given by the 
ordinary formula for the section in question (from Table 10.1) multiplied by a corrective 
factor that takes account of curvature, and these corrective factors can be used for any 
curved bar of the corresponding cross section. Also, for compression springs with the 
end turns ground down for even bearing, n, should be taken as the actual number of 
turns (including the tapered end turns) less 2. For tension springs n should be taken as 
the actual number of turns or slightly more.
Unless laterally supported, compression springs that are relatively long will buckle 
when compressed beyond a certain critical deflection. This critical deflection depends 
on the ratio of L, the free length, to D, the mean diameter, and is indicated approxi-
mately by the following tabulation, based on Ref. 27. Consideration of coil closing 
before reaching the critical deflection is necessary.

Precise Formula
For very accurate calculation of the extension of a spring, as is necessary in designing 
precision spring scales, account must be taken of the change in slope and radius of the 
coils caused by stretching. Sayre (Ref. 9) gives a formula which takes into account not

For all solid sections of irregular form (cases 19–26 inclusive) the maximum 
shear stress occurs at or very near one of the points where the largest 
inscribed circle touches the boundary,* and of these, at the one where 
the curvature of the boundary is algebraically least. (Convexity represents 
positive and concavity negative curvature of the boundary.) At a point 
where the curvature is positive (boundary of section straight or convex) this 
maximum stress is given approximately by
t

through which a tangent to the boundary rotates in turning or traveling around 
the reentrant portion, measured in radians (here r is negative).

relatively large compared with radius of median line.

Notation: Point 0 indicates the shear center. e = distance from a reference to the shear center; K = torsional stiffness constant (length to the fourth power); Cw = warping constant 
(length to the sixth power); τ1 = shear stress due to torsional rigidity of the cross section (force per unit area); τ2 = shear stress due to warping rigidity of the cross section (force 
per unit area); sx = bending stress due to warping rigidity of the cross section (force per unit area); E = modulus of elasticity of the material (force per unit area); and G = modulus of 
rigidity (shear modulus) of the material (force per unit area).

Notation: T0 = applied torsional load (force-length); t0 = applied distributed torsional load (force-length per unit length); TA and TB  are the reaction end torques at the left and right 
ends, respectively. θ = angle of rotation at a distance x from the left end (radians). ′

,
, and
 are the successive derivatives of θ with respect to the distance x. All rotations, 
applied torsional loads, and reaction end torques are positive as shown (CCW when viewed from the right end of the member). E is the modulus of elasticity of the material; Cw  
is the warping constant for the cross section; K is the torsional constant (see Table 10.2 for expressions for Cw  and K); and G is the modulus of rigidity (shear modulus) of the 
material.
The constants and functions are hereby defined in order to permit condensing the tabulated formulas which follow. See page 160 for a definition of  〈- 〉

Flat Plates
11.1  Common Case
The formulas of this section are based on the following assumptions: (1) The plate is flat, of 
uniform thickness, and of homogeneous isotropic material; (2) the thickness is not more than 
about one-quarter of the least transverse dimension, and the maximum deflection is not 
more than about one-half the thickness; (3) all forces—loads and reactions—are normal to 
the plane of the plate; and (4) the plate is nowhere stressed beyond the elastic limit. For con-
venience in discussion, it will be assumed further that the plane of the plate is horizontal.
Behavior
The plate deflects. The middle surface (halfway between top and bottom surfaces) 
remains unstressed; at other points there are biaxial stresses in the plane of the plate. 
Straight lines in the plate that were originally vertical remain straight but become 
inclined; therefore, the intensity of either principal stress at points on any such line is 
proportional to the distance from the middle surface, and the maximum stresses occur 
at the outer surfaces of the plate.
Formulas
Unless otherwise indicated, the formulas given in Tables 11.2† to 11.4 are based on very 
closely approximate mathematical analysis and may be accepted as sufficiently accu-
rate so long as the assumptions stated hold true. Certain additional facts of importance 
in relation to these formulas are as follows.
Concentrated Loading
It will be noted that all formulas for maximum stress due to a load applied over a small area 
give very high values when the radius of the loaded area approaches zero. Analysis by a more 
precise method (Ref. 12) shows that the actual maximum stress produced by a load concen-
trated on a very small area of radius ro can be found by replacing the actual ro by a so-called 
equivalent radius r’o  , which depends largely upon the thickness of the plate t and to a lesser 
degree on its least transverse dimension. Holl (Ref. 13) shows how r’o varies with the width of 
a flat plate. Westergaard (Ref. 14) gives an approximate expression for this equivalent radius:

†Note: Table 11.1 contains numerical values for functions used in Table 11.2.

446	
C h a p t e r  E l e v e n
This formula, which applies to a plate of any form, may be used for all values of ro less 
than 0.5t; for larger values, the actual ro may be used. 
Use of the equivalent radius makes possible the calculation of the finite maximum 
stresses produced by a (nominal) point loading whereas the ordinary formula would 
indicate that these stresses were infinite.
Edge Conditions
The formulas of Tables 11.2–11.4 are given for various combinations of edge support: 
free, guided (zero slope but free to move vertically), and simply supported or fixed. No 
exact edge condition is likely to be realized in ordinary construction, and a condition of 
true edge fixity is especially difficult to obtain. Even a small horizontal force at the line 
of contact may appreciably reduce the stress and deflection in a simply supported plate; 
however, a very slight yielding at nominally fixed edges will greatly relieve the stresses 
there while increasing the deflection and center stresses. For this reason, it is usually 
advisable to design a fixed-edged plate that is to carry uniform load for somewhat 
higher center stresses than are indicated by theory.
11.2  Bending of Uniform-Thickness Plates with Circular Boundaries
In Table 11.2, cases 1–5 consider annular and solid circular plates of constant thickness 
under axisymmetric loading for several combinations of boundary conditions. In addi-
tion to the formulas, tabulated values of deformation and moment coefficients are given 
for many common loading cases. The remaining cases include concentrated loading 
and plates with some circular and straight boundaries. Only the deflections due to 
bending strains are included; in Sec. 11.3, the additional deflections due to shear strains 
are considered.
Formulas
For cases 1–15 (Table 11.2), expressions are given for deformations and reactions at the 
edges of the plates as well as general equations which allow the evaluation of deflections, 
slopes, moments, and shears at any point in the plate. The several axisymmetric loadings 
include uniform, uniformly increasing, and parabolically increasing normal pressure over 
a portion of the plate. This permits the approximation of any reasonable axisymmetric dis-
tributed loading by fitting an approximate second-order curve to the variation in loading 
and solving the problem by superposition. (See the Examples at the end of this section.)
In addition to the usual loadings, Table 11.2 also includes loading cases that may be 
described best as externally applied conditions which force a lack of flatness into the plate. For 
example, in cases 6 and 14, expressions are given for a manufactured concentrated 
change in slope in a plate, which could also be used if a plastic hinge were to develop 
in a plate and the change in slope at the plastic hinge is known or assumed. Similarly, 
case 7 treats a plate with a small step manufactured into the otherwise flat surface and 
gives the reactions which develop when this plate is forced to conform to the specified 
boundary conditions. These cases are also useful when considering known boundary 
rotations or lateral displacements. (References 46, 47, 57, and 58 present tables and 
graphs for many of the loadings given in these cases.)
The use of the constants C1 to C9 and the functions F1 to F9  , L1 to L19  , and G1 to G19 in 
Table 11.2 appears to be a formidable task at first. However, when we consider the large 
number of cases it is possible to present in a limited space, the reason for this method of 

F l a t  P l a t e s 	
447
presentation becomes clear. With careful inspection, we find that the constants and 
functions with like subscripts are the same except for the change in variable. We also note 
the use of the singularity function 〈−
〉
r
ro
0,  which is given a value of 0 for r < ro and 
a value of 1 for r > ro. In Table 11.1, values are listed for all the preceding functions 
for several values of the variables b/r, b/a, ro/a, and ro/r; also listed are five of the most 
used denominators for the several values of b/a. (Note that these values are 
for v = 0.30.)
Example 1  A solid circular steel plate, 0.2 in thick and 20 in in diameter, is simply supported along 
the edge and loaded with a uniformly distributed load of 3 lb/in2. It is required to determine the 
center deflection, the maximum stress, and the deflection equation. Given: E = 30 106

Example 2  An annular aluminum plate with an outer radius of 20 in and an inner radius of 5 in is to 
be loaded with an annular line load of 40 lb/in at a radius of 10 in. Both the inner and outer edges are 
simply supported, and it is required to determine the maximum deflection and maximum stress as a 
function of the plate thickness. Given: E

 in, and w = 40 lb/in. No numerical solutions are presented for this 
combination of b/a and ro/a, and so either the equations for C1  , C3  , C7  , C9  , L3  , and L9 must be evaluated or 

448

values for these coefficients must be found in Table 11.1. Since the values of C are found for the variable

Whether the numbers in Table 11.1 can be interpolated and used successfully depends upon the 
individual problem. In some instances, where lesser degrees of accuracy are required, interpolation 
can be used; in other instances, requiring greater degrees of accuracy, it would be better to solve the 
problem for values of b and ro that do fit Table 11.1 and then interpolate between the values of the 
final deflections or stresses.
Using the preceding coefficients, the reaction force and slope can be determined at the inside edge 
and the deflection equation developed (note that yb = 0 and Mrb = 0):

Substituting the appropriate expressions for F1, F3, and G3 would produce an equation for y as a 
function of r, but a reduction of this equation to simple form and an evaluation to determine the 
location and magnitude of maximum deflection would be extremely time-consuming. Table 11.1 can 
be used again to good advantage to evalute y at specific values of r, and an excellent approximation 
to the maximum deflection can be obtained.

Example 4  A circular steel plate 2 in thick and 20 ft in diameter is simply supported at the outer 
edge and supported on a center support which can be considered to provide uniform pressure over 
a diameter of 1.8 in. The plate is loaded in an axisymmetric manner with a distributed load which 
increases linearly with radius from a value of 0 at r = 4 ft to a value of 2000 lb/ft2 at the outer edge. 
Determine the maximum bending stress. Given: E = 30 106

11.3  Circular-Plate Deflection Due to Shear
The formulas for deflection given in Table 11.2 take into account bending stresses only; 
there is, in every case, some additional deflection due to shear. Usually this is so slight 
as to be negligible, but in circular pierced plates with large openings the deflection due 
to shear may constitute a considerable portion of the total deflection. Wahl (Ref. 19) sug-
gests that this is the case when the thickness is greater than one-third the difference in 
inner and outer diameters for plates with simply supported edges, or greater than one-
sixth this difference for plates with one or both edges fixed.
Table 11.3 gives formulas for the additional deflection due to shear in which the 
form factor F has been taken equal to 1.2, as in Sec. 8.10. All the cases listed have shear 
forces which are statically determinate. For the indeterminate cases, the shear deflection, 
along with the bending deflection, must be considered in the determination of the reac-
tions if shear deflection is significant.

Essenburg and Gulati (Ref. 61) discuss the problem in which two plates when 
loaded touch over a portion of the surface. They indicate that the consideration of shear 
deformation is essential in developing the necessary expressions. Two examples are 
worked out.
Example  An annular plate with an inner radius of 1.4 in, an outer radius of 2 in, and a thickness of  
0.50 in is simply supported at the inner edge and loaded with an annular line load of 800 lb/in at a radius 
of 1.8 in. The deflection of the free outer edge is desired. Given: E = 18 106
(
) lb/in2 and v = 0.30.
Solution  To evaluate the deflection due to bending one can refer to Table 11.2, case 1k. Since b a

11.4  Bimetallic Plates
A very wide beam of rectangular cross section can be treated as a beam if E is replaced 
by E
v
/(
)
1
2
−
 and I by t3/12  (see Sec. 8.11). It can also be treated as a plate with two 
opposite edges free as shown in Figs. 8.16 and 11.2. For details see Ref. 88.
To use the beam equations in Tables 8.1, 8.5, 8.6, 8.8, and 8.9 for plates like that 
shown in Fig. 11.2 with two opposite edges free, the loadings must be uniformly distrib-
uted across the plate parallel to side b as shown. At every position in such a plate, 
except close to the free edges a, there will be bending moments M
vM
z
x
=
. If the plate is 
isotropic and homogeneous, and in the absence of any in-plane loading, there will be no 
change in length of any line parallel to side b. The response of a bimetallic plate differs 
from that of the homogeneous plate in one important respect. If the values of Poisson’s 
ratio differ for the two materials, there will be a change in length of those lines parallel 
to side b due to an in-plane strain εz  developed from the loadings shown in Fig. 11.2.

For the moment loading Mo  in Fig. 11.2(a), the value of εz, will be everywhere the same 
and the plate will merely expand or contract in the z direction. For the line loading 
shown in Fig. 11.2(c), however, the unit strains εz, will differ from place to place depend-
ing upon the value Mx,  and consequently in-plane stresses will be developed. For more 
general analyses of this type of problem see Refs. 89 and 90.
Bimetallic Circular Plates
Applying this same reasoning to a bimetallic circular plate leads to the following 
conclusions:
1.	 If the Poisson’s ratios for the two materials are equal, any of the cases in 
Table 11.2 can be used if the following equivalent value of the plate stiffness 
constant De is substituted for D.
2.	  If the Poisson’s ratios differ by a significant amount, the equivalent values of De 
and ve may be used for any combination of loading and edge restraints which 
deform the plate into a spherical surface providing the edge restraints do not 
prevent motion parallel to the surface of the plate. This restriction assures that 
bending moments are constant in magnitude at all locations in the plate and in 
all directions. Thus one can use cases 8a, 8f, 8h, and 15 with either a uniform 
temperature rise or a temperature variation through the thickness which is the 
same everywhere in the plate. Obviously one needs also an equivalent 
temperature coefficient of expansion or an equivalent loading expression 
for each such temperature loading as well as the equivalent material constants 
De and ve.

A bimetallic plate deforms laterally into a spherical surface when its uniform tem-
perature differs from To  , the temperature at which the plate is flat. Cases 8 and 15 
(Table 11.2) can be used to solve for reaction moments and forces as well as the deforma-
tions of a bimetallic plate subjected to a uniform temperature T provided that any 
guided and/or fixed edges are not capable of developing in-plane resisting forces but 
instead allow the plate to expand or contract in its plane as necessary. To use these cases 
we need only to replace the term γ(

Even when no restraints are imposed, the distortion of a bimetallic plate due to a tem-
perature change is accompanied by flexural stresses in the two materials. This differs 
from the plate made of a single material, which deforms free of stress when subjected to 
a linear temperature variation through the thickness when there are no restraints. 
Therefore, the following stresses must be added algebraically to the preceding stresses 
due to bending moments, if any. In the top surface of material a, in all directions

11.5  Nonuniform Loading of Circular Plates
The case of a circular plate under a nonuniformly distributed loading symmetrical 
about the center can be solved by treating the load as a series of elementary ring load-
ings and summing the stresses and deflections produced by such loadings. The number 
of ring loadings into which the actual load should be resolved depends upon the rate at 
which the distributed load varies along the radius and the accuracy desired. In general, 
a division of the load into rings each having a width equal to one-fifth the loaded length 
of the radius should be sufficient.
If the nonuniformly distributed loading can be reasonably approximated by a second- 
order curve, the loadings in Table 11.2, cases 2–4, can be superimposed in the necessary 
proportions. (This technique is illustrated in Sec. 11.6.) Heap (Ref. 48) gives tabular data 
for circular plates loaded with a lateral pressure varying inversely with the square of 
the radius.
Concentrated Loads
In Refs. 60 and 75–79 similar numerical techniques are discussed for concentrated loads 
on either of two concentric annular plates in combination with edge beams in some 
cases. The numerical data presented are limited but are enough to enable the reader to 
approximate many other cases.
11.6  Circular Plates on Elastic Foundations
Discussions of the theory of bending of circular plates on elastic foundations can be 
found in Refs. 21 and 46, and in Ref. 41 of Chap.8. The complexity of these solutions 
prohibits their inclusion in this handbook, but a simple iterative approach to this problem 
is possible.
The procedure consists in evaluating the deflection of the loaded plate without the 
elastic foundation and then superimposing a given fraction of the foundation reaction 
resulting from this deflection until finally the given fraction increases to 1 and the 
assumed and calculated foundation reactions are equal.

C h a p t e r  E l e v e n
Example  Given the same problem stated in Example 1 of Sec. 11.2, but in addition to the simply 
supported edge, an elastic foundation with a modulus of 20 lb/in2/in is present under the entire 
plate.
Solution  An examination of the deflection equation resulting from the uniform load shows that the 
term involving r 4 is significant only near the outer edge where the effect of foundation pressure would 
not be very large. We must also account for the fact that the foundation reactions will reduce the plate 
deflections or the procedure described may not converge. Therefore, for a first trial let us assume that 
the foundation pressure is given by

11.7  Circular Plates of Variable Thickness
For any circular plate of variable thickness, loaded symmetrically with respect to the 
center, the stresses and deflections can be found as follows: The plate is divided into an 
arbitrary number of concentric rings, each of which is assumed to have a uniform thick-
ness equal to its mean thickness. Each such ring is loaded by radial moments Ma and Mb 
at its outer and inner circumferences, respectively, by vertical shears at its inner and 
outer circumferences, and by whatever load is distributed over its surface. The shears 
are known, each being equal to the total load on the plate within the corresponding 
circumference. The problem is to determine the edge moments, and this is done by 
making use of the fact that the slope of each ring at its inner circumference is equal to 
the slope of the next inner ring at its outer circumference. This condition, together with 
the known slope (or moment) at the outer edge of the plate and the known slope (or 
moment) at the inside edge or center of the plate, enables as many equations to be writ-
ten as there are unknown quantities M. Having found all the edge moments, stresses 
and deflections can be calculated for each ring by the appropriate formulas of Table 11.2 
and the deflections added to find the deflection of the plate.
A more direct solution (Ref. 21) is available if the plate is of such form that the varia-
tion in thickness can be expressed fairly closely by the equation t
t e
o
nx
=
−
2 6
/ , where t is the 
thickness at any point a distance r from the center, to is the thickness at the center, e is the 
base for the napierian system of logarithms (2.178), x is the ratio r/a, and n is a number cho-
sen so as to make the equation agree with the actual variation in thickness. The constant n 
is positive for a plate that decreases in thickness toward the edge and negative for a plate 
that increases in thickness toward the edge. For a plate of uniform thickness, n = 0;  and for 
a plate twice as thick at the center as at the edge, n = +4 16

deflection for a uniformly loaded circular plate are given by σ

For the loadings in the preceding table as well as for a simply supported plate with 
an edge moment, Ref. 46 gives graphs and tables which permit the evaluation of radial 
and tangential stresses throughout the plate. This same reference gives extensive tables

plates in which the thickness varies as t

3  where ta is the thickness at the 
outer edge: Values are tabulated for n = 0 1 1 5
, ,
. ,  and 2 and for v = 1/6.
Stresses and deflections for plates with thicknesses varying linearly with radius are 
tabulated in Refs. 46 and 57. Annular plates with the outer edges fixed and the inner 
edges guided and with thicknesses increasing linearly with the radii from zero at the 
center are discussed in Ref. 36 and tabulated in previous editions of this handbook. A 
uniformly loaded circular plate with a fixed edge and a thickness varying linearly along 
a diameter is discussed by Strock and Yu (Ref. 65). Conway (Ref. 66) considers the nec-
essary proportions for a rib along the diameter of a uniformly loaded, clamped circular 
plate to affect a minimum weight design for a given maximum stress.
Perforated Plates
Slot and O’Donnell (Ref. 62) present the relationship between the effective elastic constants for 
thick perforated plates under bending and thin perforated plates under in-plane loading. Numeri-
cal results are presented in the form of tables and graphs, and many references are listed.
11.8  Disk Springs
The conical disk, or Belleville spring (Fig. 11.5), is not a flat plate, of course, but it may 
appropriately be considered in this chapter because it bears a superficial resemblance to 
a flat ring and is sometimes erroneously analyzed by the formulas for case 1a. The stress 
and deflection produced in a spring of this type are not proportional to the applied load 
because the change in form consequent upon deflection markedly changes the load-
deflection and load-stress relationships. This is indeed the peculiar advantage of this 
form of spring because it makes it possible to secure almost any desired variation of 
“spring rate” and also possible to obtain a considerable range of deflection under almost 
constant load. The largest stresses occur at the inner edge.
Formulas for deflection and stress at points A and B are (Ref. 27)

The formulas for stress may give either positive or negative results, depending upon δ; 
a negative result indicates compressive stress, and a positive result a tensile stress. It is 
to be noted that P also may become negative.
Wempner (Refs. 67 and 68) derives more exacting expressions for the conical spring. 
Unless the center hole is small or the cone angle is outside the range normally used for 
disk springs, however, the differences are slight. Reference 69 presents useful design 
curves based on Ref. 27.
Conical spring washers can be stacked to operate in either series or parallel. One 
must be careful to consider the effect of friction, however, when using them in the 
parallel configuration.
11.9  Narrow Ring under Distributed Torque about Its Axis
When the inner radius b is almost as great as the outer radius a, the loading for cases 1a, 
1k, 2a, 2k, and so on, becomes almost equivalent to that shown in Fig. 11.6, which rep-
resents a ring subjected to a uniformly distributed torque of M (force-length/unit 
length) about that circumference passing through the centroids at the radius R. An 
approximation to this type of loading also occurs in clamping, or “follower,” rings used 
for joining pipe; here the bolt forces and the balancing gasket or flange pressure pro-
duce the distributed torque, which obviously tends to “roll” the ring, or turn it inside 
out, so to speak.
Under this loading the ring, whatever the shape of its cross section (as long as it is 
reasonably compact) is subjected to a bending moment at every section equal to MR,

the neutral axis being the central axis of the cross section in the plane of the ring. The 
maximum resulting stress occurs at the extreme fiber and is given by Eq. (8.1-12); 
that is,
	
σ = MR

(11.9-2)
These formulas may be used to obtain approximate results for the cases of flat-plate 
loading listed previously when the difference between a and b is small, as well as for 
pipe flanges, etc. Paul (Ref. 70) discusses the collapse or inversion of rings due to 
plastic action.
Example  The cross section shown in Fig. 11.7 is from a roll-forged ring of steel used to support the 
bottom of a large shell. The modulus of elasticity is 207 GPa, or 20 7 106
2
. (
)
,
N/cm  and Poisson’s ratio 
is 0.285. The loadings from the shell are shown in Fig. 11.7(a) and are unit loads at a radius of 82 cm 
where they are applied.
Solution  In the equations for stress and angular rotation the moment distributed around the ring 
must be evaluated as that moment acting upon a segment of the ring having a unit length along the 
circumference at the radius of the centroid of the cross section. In Fig. 11.7(b) these appropriate loadings 
are shown. Before they could be found, however, the centroid and the moment of inertia about the x 
axis through this centroid must have been evaluated. This was done as follows:

First calculate the value of w which will put into equilibrium at a radius of 88 cm the vertical load of 
3000 N/cm at a radius of 82 cm. This is 2795N/cm. Next convert all these loads to the values they will 
have when applied to a free-body diagram consisting of a segment that is 1 cm long at the centroidal 
radius of 83.89 cm. For the loads on the top of the free-body diagram the length upon which they 
act is 82/83.89 = 0.9775 cm so that the desired couple is then 2500 0 9775

11.10  Bending of Uniform-Thickness Plates with Straight Boundaries
Formulas
No general expression for deflection as a function of position in a plate is given since 
solutions for plates with straight boundaries are generally obtained numerically for 
specific ratios of plate dimensions, load location, and boundary conditions. In a few 
instances Poisson’s ratio is included in the expressions given, but in most cases a spe-
cific value of Poisson’s ratio has been used in obtaining the tabulated numerical 
results and the value used is indicated. Reference 47 includes results obtained using 
several values of Poisson’s ratio and shows the range of values that can be expected 
as this ratio is changed. Errors in deflection should not exceed 7 or 8% and in maxi-
mum stress 15% for values of Poisson’s ratio in the range from 0.15 to 0.30. Since 
much of the data are obtained using finite-difference approximations for the plate dif-
ferential equations and a limited number of elements have been used, it is not always 
possible to identify maximum values if they occur at points between the chosen 
grid points.
Table 11.4 presents maximum values where possible and the significant values oth-
erwise for deflections normal to the plate surface, bending stresses, and in many cases 
the boundary reaction forces R. For rectangular plates with simply supported edges the 
maximum stresses are shown to be near the center of the plate. There are, however, 
stresses of similar magnitude near the corners if the corners are held down as has been 
assumed for all cases presented. Reference 21 discusses the increase in stress at the cen-
ter of the plate when the corners are permitted to rise. For a uniformly loaded square 
plate this increase in stress is approximately 35%.
It is impractical to include plates of all possible shapes and loadings, but many 
more cases can be found in the literature. Bares´ (Ref. 47) presents tabulated values of 
Figure 11.7  (All dimensions in centimeters)

462	
C h a p t e r  E l e v e n
bending moments and deflections for a series of plates in the form of isoceles triangles 
and symmetric trapezoids for linearly varying lateral pressures and for values of Poisson’s 
ratio of 0.0 and 0.16. Tabulated values are given for skew plates with uniform lateral 
loading and concentrated lateral loads for the support conditions where two opposite 
edges are simply supported and two edges are free; the value of Poisson’s ratio used 
was zero. In addition to many cases also included in Table 11.4, Marguerre and Woernle 
(Ref. 50) give results for line loading and uniform loading on a narrow strip across a 
rectangular plate. They also discuss the case of a rectangular plate supported within 
the span by elastic cross beams. Morley (Ref. 51) discusses solutions of problems 
involving parallelogram, or skew, plates and box structures. A few graphs and tables of 
results are given.
For plates with boundary shapes or restraints not discussed in the literature, we can 
only approximate an answer or resort to a direct numerical solution of the problem at 
hand. All numerical methods are approximate but can be carried to any degree of accu-
racy desired at the expense of time and computer costs. There are many numerical 
techniques used to solve plate problems, and the choice of a method for a given prob-
lem can be difficult. Leissa et al. (Ref. 56) have done a very complete and competent job 
of comparing and rating 9 approximate numerical methods on the basis of 11 different 
criteria. Szilard (Ref. 84) discusses both classical and numerical methods and tabulates 
many solutions.
Variable Thickness
Petrina and Conway (Ref. 63) give numerical data for two sets of boundary conditions, 
three aspect ratios and two nearly linear tapers in plate thickness. The loading was uni-
form and they found that the center deflection and center moment differed little from 
the same uniform-thickness case using the average thickness; the location and magni-
tude of maximum stress, however, did vary.
11.11  Effect of Large Deflection; Diaphragm Stresses
When the deflection becomes larger than about one-half the thickness, as may occur in 
thin plates, the middle surface becomes appreciably strained and the stress in it cannot 
be ignored. This stress, called diaphragm stress, or direct stress, enables the plate to carry 
part of the load as a diaphragm in direct tension. This tension may be balanced by 
radial tension at the edges if the edges are held or by circumferential compression if the 
edges are not horizontally restrained. In thin plates this circumferential compression 
may cause buckling.
When this condition of large deflection exists, the plate is stiffer than indicated by 
the ordinary theory and the load-deflection and load-stress relations are nonlinear. 
Stresses for a given load are less and stresses for a given deflection are generally greater 
than the ordinary theory indicates.
Circular Plates
Formulas for stress and deflection when middle surface stresses are taken into account 
are given below. These formulas should be used whenever the maximum deflection 
exceeds half the thickness if accurate results are desired. The table following gives the 
necessary constants for the several loadings and support conditions listed.

(11.11-1)
(11.11-2)
First solve for y in Eq. (11.11-1) and then obtain the stresses from Eq. (11.11-2).
Example  For the plate of Example 1 of Sec. 11.2, it is desired to determine the maximum deflection 
and maximum stress under a load of 10 lb/in2. 
Solution  If the linear theory held, the stresses and deflections would be directly proportional to 
the load, which would indicate a maximum stress of 9240 10

 Since this deflection is much more than half the thickness,  
Eqs. (11.11-3) and (11.11-2) with the constants from case 1 in the table will be used to solve for the 
deflection and stress. From Eq. (11.11-1), we obtain

Starting with a trial value for y somewhat less than 0.294 in, a solution is found when y = 0.219 in. 
From Eq. (11.11-2) the maximum stress is found to be 27,500 lb/in2.
Warshawsky (Ref. 3) fitted Eqs. (11.11-1) and (11.11-2) to the data presented by Mah in Ref. 71, and 
cases 5–9 in the following table give these results. Chia in Ref. 91 has a chapter on nonlinear bending 
of isotropic nonrectangular plates in which he covers in great detail the derivations, plotted results, 
and formulas similar to Eqs. (11.11-1) and (11.11-2) for distributed loadings, concentrated center loads, 
applied edge moments, and combined loadings for circular plates with various boundary conditions. 
The uniformly loaded circular plate on an elastic foundation is discussed and results presented for 
several boundary conditions. He also treats annular plates, elliptical plates, and skew plates under 
uniform loading. Reference 54 presents the results of a study of the large deflections of clamped 
annular sector plates for sector angles from 30–90o in steps of 30o and for ratios of inner to outer radii 
from 0–0.6 in steps of 0.2.

Elliptical Plates
Nash and Cooley (Ref. 72) present graphically the results of a uniform pressure on a 
clamped elliptical plate for a b
/ = 2. Their method of solution is presented in detail, and 
the numerical solution is compared with experimental results and with previous solu-
tions they have referenced. Ng (Ref. 73) has tabulated the values of center deflection for 
clamped elliptical plates on elastic foundations for ratios of a/b from 1 to 2 and for a 
wide range of foundation moduli. Large deflections are also graphed for two ratios a/b 
(1.5 and 2) for the same range of foundation moduli.
Rectangular Plates
Analytical solutions for uniformly loaded rectangular plates with large deflections are 
given in Refs. 30–34, where the relations among load, deflection, and stress are expressed

.
.  In this table, a, b, q, E, y, and t have the same meaning as in 
Table 11.4, σd  is the diaphragm stress, and σ  is the total stress found by adding the 
diaphragm stress and the bending stress. See also Ref. 17.
In Ref. 35 experimentally determined deflections are given and compared with 
those predicted by theory. In Ref. 74 a numerical solution for uniformly loaded rectan-
gular plates with simply supported edges is discussed, and the results for a square plate 
are compared with previous approximate solutions. Graphs are presented to show how 
stresses and deflections vary across a square plate. 
Chia in Ref. 91 includes a chapter on moderately large deflections of isotropic rectan-
gular plates. Not only are the derivations presented but the results of most cases are 
presented in the form of graphs usable for engineering calculations. Cases of initially 
deflected plates are included, and the comprehensive list of references is useful. Aalami 
and Williams in Ref. 92 present 42 tables of large-deflection reduction coefficients over a 
range of length ratios a/b and for a variety—three bending and four membrane—of sym-
metric and nonsymmetric boundary conditions. Loadings include overall uniform and 
linearly varying pressures as well as pressures over limited areas centered on the plates.
Parallelogram Plates
Kennedy and Ng (Ref. 53) present several graphs of large elastic deflections and the 
accompanying stresses for uniformly loaded skew plates with clamped edges. Several 
aspect ratios and skew angles are represented.
11.12  Plastic Analysis of Plates 
The onset of yielding in plates may occur before the development of appreciable dia-
phragm stress if the plate is relatively thick. For thinner plates, the nonlinear increase 
in stiffness due to diaphragm stresses is counteracted by the decrease in stiffness 
which occurs when the material starts to yield (Refs. 52 and 80). Save and Massonnet 
(Ref. 81) discuss the effect of the several yield criteria on the response of circular and 
rectangular plates under various loadings and give an extensive list of references. 
They also compare the results of theory with referenced experiments which have been 
performed. Orthotropy in plates can be caused by cold-forming the material or by the 
positioning of stiffeners. The effect of this orthotropic behavior on the yielding of 
circular plates is discussed by Save and Massonnet (Ref. 81) as well as by Markowitz 
and Hu (Ref. 82).
Crose and Ang (Ref. 83) describe an iterative solution scheme which first solves the 
elastic case and then increments the loading upward to allow a slow expansion of the 
yielded volume after it forms. The results of a test on a clamped plate are compared 
favorably with a theoretical solution.
11.13  Ultimate Strength
Plates of brittle material fracture when the actual maximum tensile stress reaches the 
ultimate tensile strength of the material. A flat-plate modulus of rupture, analogous to 
the modulus of rupture of a beam, may be determined by calculating the (fictitious) 
maximum stress corresponding to the breaking load, using for this purpose the appro-
priate formula for elastic stress. This flat-plate modulus of rupture is usually greater 
than the modulus of rupture determined by testing a beam of rectangular section.

Rectangular Plates Under Uniform Load Producing Large Deflection
467

468	
C h a p t e r  E l e v e n
Plates of ductile material fail by excessive plastic deflection, as do beams of similar 
material. For a number of cases the load required to produce collapse has been deter-
mined analytically, and the results for some of the simple loadings are summarized as 
follows.
1. Circular plate; uniform load, edges simply supported

(For collapse loads on partially loaded orthotropic annular plates see Refs. 81 and 82.)
3. Rectangular plate, length a, width b; uniform load, edges supported
W

y
= βσ

where β  depends on the ratio of b to a and has the following values (Ref. 44):

(Ref. 45)
In each of the above cases Wu denotes the total load required to collapse the plate,  
t the thickness of the plate, and σy  the yield point of the material. Accurate prediction 
of Wu is hardly to be expected; the theoretical error in some of the formulas may range 
up to 30%, and few experimental data seem to be available.

Notation: W = total applied load (force); w = unit line load (force per unit of circumferential length); q = load per unit area; Mo = unit applied line 
moment loading (force-length per unit of circumferential length); qo = externally applied change in radial slope (radians); yo = externally applied 
radial step in the vertical deflection (length); y = vertical deflection of plate (length) q = radial slope of plate; Mr = unit radial bending moment;  
Mt = unit tangential bending moment; Q = unit shear force (force per unit of circumferential length); E = modulus of elasticity (force per unit area); 
v = Poisson’s ratio; g  = temperature coefficient of expansion (unit strain per degree); a = outer radius; b = inner radius for annular plate; t = plate 
thickness; r = radial location of quantity being evaluated; ro = radial location of unit line loading or start of a distributed load. F1 to F9 and G1 to 
G19 are the several functions of the radial location r. C1 to C9 are plate constants dependent upon the ratio a/b. L1 to L19 are loading constants 
dependent upon the ratio a/ro. When used as subscripts, r and t refer to radial and tangential directions, respectively. When used as subscripts, 
a, b, and o refer to an evaluation of the quantity subscripted at the outer edge, inner edge, and the position of the loading or start of distributed 
loading, respectively. When used as a subscript, c refers to an evaluation of the quantity subscripted at the center of the plate. 
  Positive signs are associated with the several quantities in the following manner: Deflections y and yo are positive upward; slopes q and qo are 
positive when the deflection y increases positively as r increases; moments Mr , Mt, and Mo are positive when creating compression on the top 
surface; and the shear force Q is positive when acting upward on the inner edge of a given annular section. 
  Note: Bending stresses can be found from the moments Mr and Mt by the expression σ = 6M/t 2. The plate constant D = Et 3/12(1 - v 2). The 
singularity function brackets 〈  〉 indicate that the expression contained within the brackets must be equated to zero unless r > ro, after which they are 
treated as any other brackets. Note that Qb, Qa, Mrb, and Mra are reactions, not loads. They exist only when necessary edge restraints are provided.

Case 8. Annular plate with, from ro to a, a uniform temperature differential ∆T between the bottom and the top surface (the midplane temperature 
is assumed to be unchanged, and so no in-plane forces develop)
Note:  If the temperature difference ∆T  occurs over the entire plate,

data for KMtb are given at a radius just greater than b.

Notation: ysb, ysa and ysro are the deflections at b, a, and ro, respectively, caused by transverse shear stresses. Ksb, Ksa, Ksro are deflection coefficients 
defined by the relationships ys = Kswa/tG for an annular line load and ys = Ksqa2/tG for all distributed loadings (see Table 11.2 for all other notation and 
for the loading cases referenced).

Table 11.3  Shear Deflections for Flat Circular Plates of Constant Thickness (Continued)

526
Notation: The notation for Table 11.2 applies with the following modifications: a and b refer to plate dimensions, and when used as subscripts for stress, they refer to the stresses in 
directions parallel to the sides a and b, respectively. σ is a bending stress which is positive when tensile on the bottom and compressive on the top if loadings are considered vertically 
downward. R is the reaction force per unit length normal to the plate surface exerted by the boundary support on the edge of the plate. r′o is the equivalent radius of contact for a load 
concentrated on a very small area and is given by r′o =

Columns and Other 
Compression Members
12.1  Columns; Common Case
The formulas and discussion of this section are based on the following assumptions: 
(1) The column is nominally straight and is subjected only to nominally concentric and 
axial end loads, and such crookedness and eccentricity as may occur are accidental and 
not greater than is consistent with standard methods of fabrication and ordinary condi-
tions of service; (2) the column is homogeneous and of uniform cross section; (3) if the 
column is made up of several longitudinal elements, these elements are so connected as 
to act integrally; (4) there are no parts so thin as to fail by local buckling before the 
column as a whole has developed its full strength.
End Conditions
The strength of a column is in part dependent on the end conditions, that is, the degree 
of end fixity or constraint. A column with ends that are supported and fixed, so that 
there can be neither lateral displacement nor change in slope at either end, is called 
fixed-ended. A column with ends that are supported against lateral displacement but not 
constrained against change in slope is called round-ended. A column with one end fixed 
and the other end neither laterally supported nor otherwise constrained is called free-
ended. A column with both end surfaces that are flat and normal to the axis and that bear 
evenly against rigid loading surfaces is called flat-ended. A column with ends that bear 
against transverse pins is called pin-ended.
Truly fixed-ended and truly round-ended columns practically never occur in prac-
tice; the actual conditions are almost always intermediate. The greatest degree of fixity 
is found in columns with ends that are riveted or welded to relatively rigid parts that 
are also fixed. Theoretically, a flat-ended column is equivalent to a fixed-ended column 
until the load reaches a certain critical value at which the column “kicks out” and bears 
only on one edge of each end surface instead of on the whole surface. Actually, flat-
ended columns have a degree of end constraint considerably less than that required to 
produce fixity. The nearest approach to round-ended conditions is found in pin-ended 
columns subject to vibration or other imposed motion. The degree of end fixity may be 
expressed by the coefficient of constraint [explained following Eq. (12.1-1)] or by the free 
or effective length, which is the length measured between points of counterflexure or the 
length of a round-ended column of equal strength.

Behavior
If sufficiently slender, a column will fail by elastic instability (see Chap. 15). In this case 
the maximum unit stress sustained is less than the proportional limit of the material; it 
depends on the modulus of elasticity, the slenderness ratio (ratio of the length of the 
column to the least radius of gyration of the section), and the end conditions and is 
independent of the strength of the material. Columns which fail in this way are called 
long columns.
Columns that are too short to fail by elastic instability are called short columns; such 
a column will fail when the maximum fiber stress due to direct compression and to the 
bending that results from accidental crookedness and eccentricity reaches a certain 
value. For structural steel this value is about equal to the tensile yield point; for light 
alloys it is about equal to the compressive yield strength; and for wood it lies between 
the flexural elastic limit and the modulus of rupture.
For a given material and given end conditions, there is a certain slenderness ratio 
which marks the dividing point between long and short columns called the critical 
slenderness ratio.
Formulas for Long Columns
The unit stress at which a long column fails by elastic instability is given by the Euler 
formula
	
P

(
)
/
	
(12.1-1)
where P = total load, A = area of section, E = modulus of elasticity, L/r = slenderness 
ratio, and C is the coefficient of constraint, which depends on end conditions. For round 
ends, C = 1; for fixed ends, C = 4; and for the end conditions that occur in practice, C can 
rarely be assumed greater than 2. It is generally not considered good practice to employ 
long columns in building and bridge construction, but they are used in aircraft. (Formu-
las for the loads producing elastic instability of uniform and tapered bars under a wide 
variety of conditions of loading and support are given in Table 15.1.)
Formulas for Short Columns
It is not possible to calculate with accuracy the maximum stress produced in a short col-
umn by a nominally concentric load because of the large influence of the indeterminate 
crookedness and eccentricity. The maximum unit stress that a column will sustain, how-
ever, can be expressed by any of a number of formulas, each of which contains one or 
more terms that is empirically adjusted to secure conformity with test results. Of such 
formulas, those given below are the best known and provide the basis for most of the 
design formulas used in American practice. In these equations P denotes the load at failure, 
A the cross-sectional area, L the length, and r the least radius of gyration of the section; 
the meaning of other symbols used is explained in the discussion of each formula.

This formula is adapted from the formula for stress due to eccentric loading [Eq. (12.4-1)]. 
Here s denotes the maximum fiber stress at failure (usually taken as the yield point for 
steel and as the yield strength for light alloys); e denotes the equivalent eccentricity (that 
eccentricity which in a perfectly straight column would cause the same amount of bend-
ing as the actual eccentricity and crookedness); c denotes the distance from the central 
axis about which bending occurs to the extreme fiber on the concave or compression 
side of the bent column; and K is a numerical coefficient, dependent on end conditions, 
such that KL is the effective length of the column, or distance between points of inflec-
tion. The term ec/r2 is called the eccentric ratio, and a value is assumed for this ratio 
which makes the formula agree with the results of tests on columns of the type under 
consideration. For example, tests on structural steel columns of conventional design 
indicate that the average value of the eccentric ratio is 0.25. In using the secant formula, 
P/A must be solved for by trial or by the use of prepared charts.

results of tests on short prisms when L/r is very small and with Euler’s equation when 
L/r is very large. More often s and φ are adjusted empirically to make the equation 
agree with the results of tests through the L/r range of most importance.

This is an empirical formula. For most steels the exponent n is chosen as 2 and s is cho-
sen as the yield point to give the well-known parabolic formula. The constant k is gener-
ally chosen to make the parabola intersect tangent to the Euler curve for a long column. 
See Refs. 1–4.
For cast irons and for many of the aluminum alloys (Refs. 1 and 5) the exponent n is 
taken as unity to give a straight-line formula. If s were here taken as the maximum fiber 
stress at failure and the straight line made tangent to the Euler curve, the formula would 
give values well below experimental values. For this reason the straight-line formula is 
generally used for intermediate lengths with s and k modified to make the straight line 
pass through the experimental data of interest. For columns shorter than intermediate 
in length, a constant value of P/A is given; for those longer than intermediate, the Euler 
curve is specified.
For timber the exponent n is usually chosen as 4 (Refs. 1 and 6) and then treated in 
the same manner as was the parabolic formula. The value used for s is generally the 
ultimate compressive strength of the timber.

In the case of the secant formula at very short lengths, the lower values can be 
attributed to the chosen eccentricity ratio of 0.25.
By applying a proper factor of safety, a safe load can be calculated. Many codes make 
use of safety factors which vary with the effective L r
/  ratios, so the safe-load formulas 
may differ somewhat in form from the ultimate-load formulas just discussed. See Ref. 1 
for extensive listings of applicable codes and design specifications.
Calculation of Stress
The best way to compute the probable value of the maximum fiber stress in a short 
column, caused by the imposition of a nominally concentric load that is less than the 
ultimate load, is to use the secant formula [Eq. (12.1-2)] with an assumed value of e or 
ec r
/ 2. However, by transposing terms, any one of Eqs. (12.1-3)–(12.1-5) can be written 
so as to give the maximum stress s in terms of the load P. Such procedure is logical only 
when s is the fiber stress at failure and P the ultimate load; but if the maximum stress 
due to some load that is less than the ultimate load is thus computed, the result, although 
probably considerably in error, is almost sure to be greater than the true stress and 
hence the method errs on the side of safety.
12.2  Local Buckling
If a column is composed wholly or partially of thin material, local buckling may occur 
at a unit load less than that required to cause failure of the column as a whole. When 
such local buckling occurs at a unit stress less than the proportional limit, it represents 
elastic instability; the critical stress at which this occurs can be determined by mathematical

analysis. Formulas for the critical stress at which bars and thin plates exhibit elastic 
instability, under various conditions of loading and support, are given in Tables 15.1 
and 15.2. All such formulas are based upon assumptions as to homogeneity of material, 
regularity of form, and boundary conditions that are never realized in practice; the 
critical stress to be expected under any actual set of circumstances is nearly always less 
than that indicated by the corresponding theoretical formula and can be determined 
with certainty only by test. This is also true of the ultimate load that will be carried by 
such parts as they buckle since elastic buckling is not necessarily attended by failure, 
and thin flanges and webs, by virtue of the support afforded by attached parts, may 
carry a load considerably in excess of that at which buckling occurs (see Sec. 12.6).
In the following paragraphs, the more important facts and relations that have been 
established concerning local buckling are stated, insofar as they apply to columns of 
more or less conventional design. In the formulas given, b represents the unsupported 
width of the part under consideration, t its thickness, s y the yield point or yield strength, 
and E and ν have their usual meanings.

For the outstanding flange of a column, the edge condition is intermediate, with the 
degree of constraint depending upon the torsional rigidity of the main member and on 
the way in which the flange is attached. The conclusions of the ASCE Column Research 
Committee (Ref. 8) on this point may be summed up as follows: For columns of struc-
tural steel having a proportional limit of 30 000

lb/in2, an outstanding flange riveted 
between two angles, each having a thickness equal to that of the flange, will not fail by 
elastic buckling if b t

The ultimate strength of an outstanding flange is practically equal to the area times 
the yield point up to a b t
/  ratio of 15; for wider flanges the ultimate load is not appre-
ciably greater, and so there is no substantial gain in load-carrying capacity when the 
width of a flange is increased to more than 15 times the thickness. In Ref. 2 are given 
recommended limiting values of width/thickness ratios in terms of s y for webs, flanges, 
and other parts subject to buckling.

For structural steel columns, the conclusion of the ASCE Column Research Com-
mittee (Ref. 8) is that elastic buckling will not occur at b t

by the Bureau of Standards (Ref. 14) on steel members consisting of wide webs riveted 
between edge angles indicate that this conclusion is conservative and that b t
/  may be 
safely as great as 35 if b is taken as the width between rivet lines.
For aluminum columns, the same formulas for allowable stress on a thin web are 
suggested as are given previously for the outstanding flange [(Eqs. (12.2-5) and (12.2-6)] 
but with k = 1 2
. . (For discussion of the ultimate strength developed by a thin web, see 
Sec. 12.6.)

Much recent work has been concerned with measuring initial imperfections in man-
ufactured cylindrical tubes and correlating these imperfections with measured critical 
loads. For more detailed discussions and recommendations refer to Refs. 1–5 in this 
chapter and to Refs. 101–109 in Chap. 15.

Attached Plates
When the flanges or web of a column are formed by riveting a number of plates placed 
flat against one another, there is a possibility that the outer plate or plates will buckle 
between points of attachment if the unsupported length is too great compared with 
the thickness. If the full yield strength s y of an outer plate is to be developed, the ratio 
of unsupported length a to thickness t should not exceed the value indicated by the 
formula (Ref. 17).

(12.2-14)
Some specifications (Ref. 10) guard against the possibility of such buckling by limiting 
the maximum distance between rivets (in the direction of the stress) to 16 times the 
thickness of the thinnest outside plate and to 20 times the thickness of the thinnest 
inside plate; the ratio 16 is in agreement with Eq. (12.2-14).
Local Buckling of Latticed Columns
To guard against the possibility that the longitudinal elements of a latticed column will 
buckle individually between points of support, some specifications (Ref. 10) limit the 
slenderness ratio of such parts between points of attachment of lacing bars to 40 or to 
two-thirds the slenderness ratio of the column as a whole, whichever is less.
Lacing Bars
In a column composed of channels or other structural shapes connected by lacing bars, 
the function of the lacing bars is to resist the transverse shear due to initial obliquity and 
that consequent upon such bending as may occur under load. The amount of this shear 
is conjectural since the obliquity is accidental and indeterminate.
Salmon (Ref. 17) shows that with the imperfections usually to be expected, the 
transverse shear will be at least 1% of the axial load. Moore and Talbot (Ref. 18) found 
that for certain experimental columns the shear amounted to from 1–3% of the axial 
load. Some specifications require that in buildings the lacing be designed to resist a 
shear equal to 2% of the axial load (Ref. 2), and that in bridges it be designed to resist a 
shear V given by

where P is the allowable axial load and r is the radius of gyration of the column section 
with respect to the central axis perpendicular to the plane of the lacing (Ref. 10).
The strength of individual lacing bars as columns has been investigated experimen-
tally. For a bar of rectangular section with a single rivet at each end, the ultimate strength 
(in psi) is given by

For bars of angle or channel section, these formulas are conservative. For flat bars used 
as double lacing, the crossed bars being riveted together, tests show that the effective L 
is about half the actual distance between end rivets. Some specifications (Refs. 2 and 10) 
require lacing bars of any section to be designed by the regular column formula, L being 
taken as the distance between end rivets for single lacing and as 70% of that distance for 
double lacing. There are additional limitations as to slope of lacing, minimum section, 
and method of riveting.
12.3  Strength of Latticed Columns
Although it is customary to assume that a latticed column acts integrally and develops 
the full strength of the nominal section, tests show that when bending occurs in the plane 
of the lacing, the column is less stiff than would be the case if this assumption were valid. 
For a column so designed that buckling occurs in a plane normal to that of the lacing, this 
fact is unimportant; but in long open columns laced on all sides, such as are often used for 
derrick booms and other light construction, it may be necessary to take it into account.
For any assumed transverse loading, it is easy to calculate that part of the deflection 
of a latticed member which is due to strains in the lacing bars and thus to derive a value 
for what may be called the reduced modulus of elasticity KE. Such calculations agree rea-
sonably well with the results of tests (see Ref. 8), but K, of course, varies with the nature 
of the assumed transverse loading or with the form of the assumed elastic curve, which 
amounts to the same thing. For uniformly distributed loading and end support, and for 
the type of lacing shown in Fig. 12.1(a), K is given by

where L = length of the column, I = moment of inertia of the column cross section about 
the principal axis which is normal to the plane of battens, and A = cross-sectional area of a 
single lacing bar. For double lacing, 2.4 should be used in place of 4.8. If KE is used in place 
of E, the effect of reduced stiffness on the strength of a long column will be approximately 
allowed for. The method is theoretically inexact mainly because the form of elastic curve 
assumed is not identical with that taken by the column, but the error due to this is small.
Timoshenko (Ref. 19) gives formulas based upon the assumption that the elastic 
curve of the column is a sinusoid, from which the following expressions for K may be 
derived. For the arrangement shown in Fig. 12.1(a),

, where t is the 
batten-plate thickness and c is the batten-plate width measured parallel to the length 
of the column).
In all the preceding expressions for K, it is assumed that all parts have the same 
modulus of elasticity, and only the additional deflection due to longitudinal strain in 
the lacing bars and to secondary flexure of channels and batten plates is taken into 
account. For fairly long columns laced over practically the entire length, the values of 
K given by Eqs. (12.3-1)–(12.3-3) are probably sufficiently accurate. More elaborate for-
mulas for shear deflection, in which direct shear stress in the channels, bending of the 
end portions of channels between stay plates, and rivet deformation, as well as longi-
tudinal strains in lacing bars, are taken into account, are given in Ref. 8; these should be 
used when calculating the deflection of a short latticed column under direct transverse 
loading.
The use of K as a correction factor for obtaining a reduced value of E is convenient 
in designing long latticed columns; for short columns the correction is best made by 
replacing L in whatever column formula is selected by (
)
1/K L.
Several failure modes and the critical loads associated with these modes are dis-
cussed in Refs. 11 and 12.
12.4  Eccentric Loading; Initial Curvature

axes of the section (here called axis 1), the formula for the maximum stress produced is

If a column with fixed ends is loaded eccentrically, as is assumed here, the effect of 
the eccentricity is merely to increase the constraining moments at the ends; the moment 
at midlength and the buckling load are not affected. If the ends are partially constrained, 
as by a frictional moment M, this constraint may be taken into account by considering 
the actual eccentricity e reduced to e

Example  Figure 12.2 represents the cross section of a structural steel column composed of two 10-in, 
35-lb channels placed 12 in back to back and latticed together. The length of the column is 349.3 in, and 
it has single lacing, the bars being of rectangular section, 2½ by ¼ in, and inclined at 45°. This column 
is loaded eccentrically, the load being applied on axis 2 but 2.40 in from axis 1. With respect to bending 
in the plane of the eccentricity, the column is round-ended. It is required to calculate the maximum 
fiber stress in the column when a load of 299,000 lb, or 14 850

12.5  Columns under Combined Compression and Bending
A column bent by lateral forces or by couples presents essentially the same problem as 
a beam under axial compression, and the stresses produced can be found by the formu-
las of Table 8.8 provided the end conditions are determinable. Because these and other 
uncertainties generally preclude precise solution, it is common practice to rely upon 
some interaction formula, such as one of those given below. The column may be consid-
ered safe for the given loading when the relevant equations are satisfied.
The following notation is common to all the equations; other terms are defined as 
introduced:
 Fa = allowable value of P A
/  for the member considered as a concentrically loaded  
	
column
Fb = allowable value of compressive fiber stress for the member considered as a  
	
beam under bending only
   fa = P/A = average compressive stress due to the axial load P

made of a very thin sheet reinforced with attached stiffeners; this construction is espe-
cially common in airplanes, where both wings and fuselage are often of the “stressed-
skin” type.
When a load is applied to such a combination, the portions of the plate not very 
close to the stiffeners buckle elastically at a very low unit stress, but those portions 
immediately adjacent to the stiffeners develop the same stress as do the latter, and por-
tions a short distance from the stiffeners develop an intermediate stress. In calculating 
the part of any applied load that will be carried by the plate or in calculating the 
strength of the combination, it is convenient to make use of the concept of “effective,” 
or “apparent,” width, i.e., the width of that portion of the sheet which, if it developed 
the same stress as the stiffener, would carry the same load as is actually carried by the 
entire sheet.
For a flat, rectangular plate that is supported but not fixed along each of two oppo-
site edges and subjected to a uniform shortening parallel to those edges, the theoretical 
expression (Ref. 20) for the effective width is

where w = the effective width along each supported edge, t = the thickness of the plate, 
and s = the unit stress at the supported edge. Since the maximum value of s is sy (the 
yield point or yield strength), the maximum load that can be carried by the effective 
strip or by the whole plate (which amounts to the same thing) is

In the case of a cylindrical panel loaded parallel to the axis, the effective width at failure 
can be taken as approximately equal to that for a flat sheet, but the increase in the buck-
ling stress in the central portion of the panel due to curvature must be taken into 
account. Sechler shows that the contribution of this central portion to the strength of the 
panel may be allowed for by using for C in the formula P

 , and Cf   , is the value of C for a flat sheet, as given

The above formulas and experimental data refer to single sheets supported along 
each edge. In calculating the load carried by a flat sheet with longitudinal stiffeners at any 
given stiffener stress s s , the effective width corresponding to that stress is found by

where As is the section area of one stiffener. When s s is the maximum unit load the stiff-
ener can carry as a column, P becomes the ultimate load for the reinforced sheet.
In calculating the ultimate load on a curved sheet with stiffeners, the strength of 
each unit or panel may be found by adding to the buckling strength of the central por-
tion of the panel the strength of a column made up of the stiffener and the effective 
width of the attached sheet, this effective width being found by

 and sc is the unit 
load that the stiffener-and-sheet column will carry before failure, determined by an 
appropriate column formula. [For the type of thin section often used for stiffeners in 
airplane construction, sc may be found by Eq. (12.2-7) or (12.2-8).] Since the unit load sc 
and the effective width w are interdependent (because of the effect of w on the column 

C o l u m n s  a n d  O t h e r  C o m p r e s s i o n  M e m b e r s

radius of gyration), it is necessary to assume a value of sc, calculate the corresponding 
w, and then ascertain if the value of sc is consistent (according to the column formula 
used) with this w. (This procedure may have to be repeated several times before agree-
ment is reached.) Then, sc and w being known, the strength of the stiffener-and-sheet 
combination is calculated as

where n is the number of stiffeners, As is the section area of one stiffener, b is the dis-
tance between stiffeners (rivet line to rivet line) and σ′ is the critical buckling stress 
for the central portion of the sheet, taken as ′ =

. Et r
/  (r being the radius of curvature 
of the sheet).
Methods of calculating the strength of stiffened panels and thin columns subject to 
local and torsional buckling are being continually modified in the light of current study 
and experimentation. A more extensive discussion than is appropriate here can be 
found in books on airplane stress analysis, as well as in Refs. 4 and 5.
12.7  Short Prisms under Eccentric Loading
When a compressive or tensile load is applied eccentrically to a short prism (i.e., one so 
short that the effect of deflection is negligible), the resulting stresses are readily found 
by superposition. The eccentric load P is replaced by an equal axial load ′
P  and by 
couples Pe1 and Pe2, where e1 and e2 denote the eccentricities of P with respect to the 
principal axes 1 and 2, respectively. The stress at any point, or the maximum stress, is 
then found by superposing the direct stress ′
P A
/  due to the axial load and the bending 
stresses due to the couples Pe1 and Pe2, these being found by the ordinary flexure for-
mula (Sec. 8.1).
If, however, the prism is composed of a material that can withstand compression only 
(masonry) or tension only (very thin shell), this method cannot be employed when the 
load acts outside the kern because the reversal of stress implied by the flexure formula can-
not occur. By assuming a linear stress distribution and making use of the facts that the 
volume of the stress solid must equal the applied load P and that the center of gravity of 
the stress solid must lie on the line of action of P, formulas can be derived for the position 
of the neutral axis (line of zero stress) and for maximum fiber stress in a prism of any given 
cross section. A number of such formulas are given in Table 12.1, together with the dimen-
sions of the kern for each of the sections considered. For any section that is symmetrical 
about the axis of eccentricity, the maximum stress K P A
(
)
/
 is just twice the average stress 
P A
/  when the load is applied at the edge of the kern and increases as the eccentricity 
increases, becoming (theoretically) infinite when the load is applied at the extreme fiber. A 
prism made of material incapable of sustaining both tension and compression will fail 
completely when the resultant of the loads falls outside the boundary of any cross section, 
and will crack (under tension) or buckle (under compression) part way across any section 
through which the resultant of the loads passes at a point lying outside the kern.
For any section not shown in Table 12.1, a chart may be constructed showing the 
relation between e and x; this is done by assuming successive positions of the neutral 
axis (parallel to one principal axis) and solving for the corresponding eccentricity by the 
relation b
I M
= /
, where b = distance from the neutral axis to the point of application of 
the load (assumed to be on the other principal axis), I = moment of inertia, and M = the 
statical moment about the neutral axis of that part of the section carrying stress. The 

566	
C h a p t e r  T w e l v e
position of the neutral axis for any given eccentricity being known, the maximum stress 
can be found by the relation smax = Px M
/
. These equations simply express the facts 
stated above—that the center of gravity of the stress solid lies on the line of action of P, 
and that the volume of the stress solid is equal to P. The procedure outlined is simple in 
principle but rather laborious when applied to any except the simpler type of section 
since both M and I may have to be determined by graphical integration.
The method of solution just outlined and all the formulas of Table 12.1 are based on 
the assumption that the load is applied on one of the principal axes of the section. If the 
load is applied outside the kern and on neither principal axis, solution is more difficult 
because neither the position nor the direction of the neutral axis corresponding to a 
given position of the load is known. The following graphical method, which involves 
successive trials, may be used for a section of any form.
Let a prism of any section (Fig. 12.3) be loaded at any point P. Guess the position of the 
neutral axis NN. Draw from NN to the most remote fiber q the perpendicular aq. That part 
of the section on the load side of NN is under compression, and the intensity of stress varies 
linearly from 0 at NN to s at q. Divide the stressed area into narrow strips of uniform width 
dy running parallel to NN. The total stress on any strip acts at the center of that strip and is 
proportional to the area of the strip w dy and to its distance y from NN. Draw the locus of 
the centers of the strips bcq and mark off a length of strip extending ½ wy/x to each side of 
this locus. This portion of the strip, if it sustained a unit stress s, would carry the same total 
load as does the whole strip when sustaining the actual unit stress sy x
/  and may be called 
the effective portion of the strip. The effective portions of all strips combine to form the effective 
area, shown as the shaded portion of Fig. 12.3. Now if the assumed position of NN is correct, 
the centroid of this effective area will coincide with the point P and the maximum stress s 
will then be equal to the load P divided by the effective area.
To ascertain whether or not the centroid of the effective area does coincide with P, trace 
its outline on stiff cardboard; then cut out the piece so outlined and balance it on a pin 
thrust through at P. If the piece balances in any position, P is, of course, the centroid. Obvi-
ously the chance of guessing the position of NN correctly at the first attempt is remote, and 
a number of trials are likely to be necessary. Each trial, however, enables the position of 
NN to be estimated more closely, and the method is less tedious than might be supposed.
For a solid rectangular section, Esling (Ref. 15) explains a special method of analysis 
and gives tabulated constants which greatly facilitate solution for this particular case. 
The coefficient K, by which the average stress P A
/  is multiplied to give the maximum 
stress s, is given as a function of the eccentric ratios e
d
1/  and e
b
2/ , where the terms 
have the meaning shown by Fig. 12.4. The values of K, taken from Esling’s paper, are as 
shown in the accompanying table.

Example  A bridge pier of masonry, 80 ft high, is rectangular in section, measuring at the base 20 
by 10 ft, the longer dimension being parallel to the track. This pier is subjected to a vertical load P 
(including its own weight) of 1500 tons, a horizontal braking load (parallel to the track) of 60 tons, and 
a horizontal wind load Pz (transverse to the track) of 50 tons. It is required to determine the maximum 
compressive stress at the base of the pier, first assuming that the masonry can sustain tension and, 
second, that it cannot.
Solution  For convenience in numerical work, the ton will be retained as the unit of force and the foot 
as the unit of distance.
(a)	 Masonry can sustain tension: Take d = 20 ft, and b = 10 ft, and take axes 1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 12.5.

13.1  Circumstances and General State of Stress
The discussion and formulas in this section apply to any vessel that is a figure of revolu-
tion. For convenience of reference, a line that represents the intersection of the wall and 
a plane containing the axis of the vessel is called a meridian, and a line representing the 
intersection of the wall and a plane normal to the axis of the vessel is called a circumfer-
ence. Obviously the meridian through any point is perpendicular to the circumference 
through that point.
When a vessel of the kind under consideration is subjected to a distributed loading, 
such as internal or external pressure, the predominant stresses are membrane stresses, 
i.e., stresses constant through the thickness of the wall. There is a meridional membrane 
stress σ1 acting parallel to the meridian, a circumferential, or hoop, membrane stress σ2
acting parallel to the circumference, and a generally small radial stress σ3 varying 
through the thickness of the wall. In addition, there may be bending and/or shear 
stresses caused by loadings or physical characteristics of the shell and its supporting 
structure. These include (1) concentrated loads, (2) line loads along a meridian or cir-
cumference, (3) sudden changes in wall thickness or an abrupt change in the slope of 
the meridian, (4) regions in the vessel where a meridian becomes normal to or approaches 
being normal to the axis of the vessel, and (5) wall thicknesses greater than those con-
sidered thin-walled, resulting in variations of σ1 and σ2 through the wall.
In consequence of these stresses, there will be meridional, circumferential, and 
radial strains leading to axial and radial deflections and changes in meridional slope. If 
there is axial symmetry of both the loading and the vessel, there will be no tendency for 
any circumference to depart from the circular form unless buckling occurs.
13.2  Thin Shells of Revolution under Distributed Loadings Producing 
Membrane Stresses Only
If the walls of the vessel are relatively thin (less than about one-tenth the smaller prin-
cipal radius of curvature) and have no abrupt changes in thickness, slope, or curvature, 
and if the loading is uniformly distributed or smoothly varying and axisymmetric, the 
stresses σ1 and σ2 are practically uniform throughout the thickness of the wall and are 
the only important ones present; the radial stress σ3 and such bending stresses as occur

are negligibly small. Table 13.1 gives formulas for the stresses and deformations under 
loadings such as those just described for cylindrical, conical, spherical, and toroidal 
vessels as well as for general smooth figures of revolution as listed under case 4.
If two thin-walled shells are joined to produce a vessel, and if it is desired to have 
no bending stresses at the joint under uniformly distributed or smoothly varying loads, 
then it is necessary to choose shells for which the radial deformations and the rotations 
of the meridians are the same for each shell at the point of connection. For example, a 
cylindrical shell under uniform internal pressure will have a radial deformation of 
qR

 while a hemispherical head of equal thickness under the same pressure 
will have a radial deformation of qR
Et

(

- ν /
; the meridian rotation ψ is zero in both 
cases. This mismatch in radial deformation will produce bending and shear stresses in 
the near vicinity of the joint. An examination of case 4a (Table 13.1) shows that if R1 is 
infinite at θ =
°
90 for a smooth figure of revolution, the radial deformation and the rota-
tion of the meridian will match those of the cylinder.
Flügge (Ref. 5) points out that the family of cassinian curves has the property just 
described. He also discusses in some detail the ogival shells, which have a constant 
radius of curvature R1 for the meridian but for which R2 is a variable. If R2 is everywhere 
less than R1, the ogival shell has a pointed top, as shown in Fig. 13.1(a). If R2 is infinite, 
as it is at point A in Fig. 13.1(b), the center of the shell must be supported to avoid large 
bending stresses although some bending stresses are still present in the vicinity of point A. 
For more details of these deviations from membrane action see Refs. 66 and 74–76.
For very thin shells where bending stresses are negligible, a nonlinear membrane 
theory can provide more realistic values near the crown, point A. Rossettos and Sanders 
have carried out such a solution (Ref. 52). Chou and Johnson (Ref. 57) have examined 
large deflections of elastic toroidal membranes of a type used in some sensitive pres-
sure-measuring devices.
Galletly in Ref. 67 shows that simple membrane theory is not adequate for the stress 
analysis of most torispherical pressure vessels. Ranjan and Steele in Ref. 68 have worked 
with asymptotic expansions and give a simple design formula for the maximum stress 
in the toroidal segment which is in good agreement with experimental and numerical 
studies. They present a simple condition that gives the ­optimum knuckle radius for 
prescribed spherical cap and cylinder geometries and also give expressions leading to a 
lower limit for critical internal pressure at which wrinkles are formed due to circumfer-
ential compression in the toroid.
Baker, Kovalevsky, and Rish (Ref. 6) give formulas for toroidal segments, ogival 
shells, elliptical shells, and Cassini shells under various loadings; all these cases can be 
evaluated from case 4 of Table 13.1 once R1 and R2 are calculated. In addition to the 
axisymmetric shells considered in this chapter, Refs. 5, 6, 45, 59, 66, 74, 81, and 82 discuss

in some detail the membrane stresses in nonaxisymmetric shells, such as barrel vaults, 
elliptic cylinders, and hyperbolic paraboloids.
Example 1  A segment of a toroidal shell shown in Fig. 13.2 is to be used as a transition between a 
cylinder and a head closure in a thin-walled pressure vessel. To properly match the deformations, it 
is desired to know the change in radius and the rotation of the meridian at both ends of the toroidal 
segment under an internal pressure loading of 200

the cone if the cone is subjected to an acceleration parallel to its axis of 399g.
Solution  Since the formulas for a cone loaded by its own weight are given only for a complete cone, 
superposition will have to be used. From Table 13.1 cases 2c and 2d will be applicable. First take 
a complete cone loaded by its own weight with its density multiplied by 400 to account for the

13.3  Thin Shells of Revolution under Concentrated or Discontinuous 
Loadings Producing Bending and Membrane Stresses
Cylindrical Shells
Table 13.2 gives formulas for forces, moments, and displacements for several axi-
symmetric loadings on both long and short thin-walled cylindrical shells having free 
ends. These expressions are based on differential equations similar in form to those 

S h e l l s  o f  R e v o l u t i o n ;  P r e s s u r e  Ve s s e l s ;  P i p e s 	
579
used to develop the formulas for beams on elastic foundations in Chap. 8. To avoid 
excessive redundancy in the presentation, only the free-end cases are given in this 
chapter, but all of the loadings and boundary conditions listed in Tables 8.5 and 8.6 
as well as the tabulated data in Tables 8.3 and 8.4 are directly applicable to cylindrical 
shells by substituting the shell parameters λ and D for the beam parameters β and 
EI, respectively. (This will be demonstrated in the examples which follow.) Since 
many loadings on cylindrical shells occur at the ends, note carefully on page 175 the 
modified numerators to be used in the equations in Table 8.5 for the condition when 
a = 0. A special application of this would be the situation where one end of a cylin-
drical shell is forced to increase a known amount in radius while maintaining zero 
slope at that same end. This reduces to an application of an externally created concen-
trated lateral displacement ∆0 at a = 0 (Table 8.5, case 6) with the left end fixed. (See 
Example 4.)
Pao (Ref. 60) has tabulated influence coefficients for short cylindrical shells under 
edge loads with wall thicknesses varying according to t

. Stanek (Ref. 49) has tabu-
lated similar coefficients for constant-thickness cylindrical shells.
A word of caution is in order at this point. The original differential equations used 
to develop the formulas presented in Table 13.2 were based on the assumption that 
radial deformations were small. If the magnitude of the radial deflection approaches 
the wall thickness, the accuracy of the equations declines. In addition, if axial loads are 
involved on a relatively short shell, the moments of these axial loads might have an 
appreciable effect if large deflections are encountered. The effects of these moments are 
not included in the expressions given.
Example 1   A steel tube with a 4.180-in outside diameter and a 0.05-in wall thickness is free at both 
ends and is 6 in long. At a distance of 2 in from the left end a steel ring with a circular cross section is 
shrunk onto the outside of the tube such as to compress the tube radially inward a distance of 0.001 in.  
The maximum tensile stress in the tube is desired. Given: E = 30 106

The small change in the maximum stress produced in this shorter tube points out how localized the 
effect of a load on a shell can be. Had the radial load been the same, however, instead of the radial 
deflection, a greater difference might have been noted and the stress σ2 would have increased in 
magnitude instead of decreased.
Example 3  A cylindrical aluminum shell is 10 in long and 15 in in diameter and must be designed to 
carry an internal pressure of 300
2
lb/in   without exceeding a maximum tensile stress of 12 000

lb/in . 
The ends are capped with massive flanges, which are sufficiently clamped to the shell to effectively 
resist any radial or rotational deformation at the ends. Given: E = 10 106

First solution  Case 1c from Table 13.1 and cases 1 and 3 or cases 8 and 10 from Table 13.2 can be 
superimposed to find the radial end load and the end moment which will make the slopes and 
deflections at both ends zero. Figure 13.4 shows the loadings applied to the shell. First we evaluate 
the necessary constants:

Since the thickness is unknown at this step in the calculation, we can only estimate whether 
the shell must be considered long or short, i.e., whether the loads at one end will have  
any influence on the deformations at the other. To make an estimate of this effect we can calculate the 
wall thickness necessary for just the internal pressure. From case 1c of Table 13.1, the value of the hoop 
stress σ2 = qR t

Using this value for t gives λl = 10 84

, which would be a very long shell.
For a trial solution the assumption will be made that the radial load and bending moment at  
the right end do not influence the deformations at the left end. Owing to the rigidity of the end 
caps, the radial deformation and the angular rotation of the left end will be set equal to zero. From

be considered a long shell for this loading and support.
Second solution  This loaded shell represents a case where both ends are fixed and a uniform radial 
pressure is applied over the entire length. Since the shell is considered long, we can find the expressions 
for RA and MA in Table 8.6, case 2, under the condition of the left end fixed and where the distance 
a = 0 and b can be considered infinite.

If -Vo is substituted for RA, Mo for MA, λ for β, and D for EI, the solution should apply to the problem

Example 4  A 2-in length of steel tube described in Example 1 is heated, and rigid plugs are inserted 
½ in into each end. The rigid plugs have a diameter equal to the inside diameter of the tube plus 
0.004 in at room temperature. Find the longitudinal and circumferential stresses at the outside of 
the tube adjacent to the end of the plug and the diameter at midlength after the tube is shrunk into 
the plugs.
Solution  The most straightforward solution would consist of assuming that the portion of the tube 
outside the rigid plug is, in effect, displaced radially a distance of 0.002 in and owing to symmetry 
the midlength has zero slope. A steel cylindrical shell ½ in in length, fixed on the left end with a radial

is only hypothetical, the actual stresses present would be smaller when a solid but elastic plug is used. 
External clamping around the shell over the plugs would also be necessary to fulfill the assumed 
fixed-end condition. The stresses calculated are therefore maximum possible values and would be 
conservative.
Spherical Shells
The format used to present the formulas for the finite-length cylindrical shells could be 
adapted for finite portions of open spherical and conical shells with both edge loads 
and loads applied within the shells if we were to accept the approximate solutions 
based on equivalent cylinders. Baker, Kovalevsky, and Rish (Ref. 6) present formu-
las based on this approximation for open spherical and conical shells under edge loads 
and edge displacements. For partial spherical shells under axisymmetric loading, Heté-
nyi, in an earlier work (Ref. 14), discusses the errors introduced by this same approxi-
mation and compares it with a better approximate solution derived therein. Table 13.3,  
case 1, gives formulas based on Hetényi’s work, and although it is estimated that the 
calculational effort is twice that of the simpler approximation, the errors in maximum 
stresses are decreased substantially, especially when the opening angle φ is much dif-
ferent from 90°.
Stresses and deformations due to edge loads decrease exponentially away from the 
loaded edges of axisymmetric shells, and consequently boundary conditions or other 
restraints are not important if they are far enough from the loaded edge. For example, 
the exponential term decreases to approximately 1% when the product of the spherical 
shell parameter β (see Table 13.3, case 1) and the angle ω (in radians) is greater than 4.5; 
similarly it reduces to approximately 5% at βω = 3. This means that a spherical shell 
with a radius/thickness ratio of 50, for which β ≈9, can have an opening angle φ as 
small as 1/3 rad, or 19°, and still be solved with formulas for cases 1 with very little 
error. Figure 13.5 shows three shells, for which R t
/  is approximately 50, which would 
respond similarly to the edge loads Mo and Qo. In fact, the conical portion of the shell in 
Fig. 13.5(c) could be extended much closer than 19° to the loaded edge since the conical 
portion near the junction of the cone and sphere would respond in a similar way to the 
sphere. (Hetényi discusses this in Ref. 14.)
Similar bounds on nonspherical but axisymmetric shells can be approximated by 
using closely matching equivalent spherical shells (Ref. 6). (We should note that the 

586	
C h a p t e r  T h i r t e e n
angle φ in Table 13.3, case 1, is not limited to a maximum of 90°, as will be illustrated in 
the examples at the end of this section.)
For shallow spherical shells where φ is small, Gerdeen and Niedenfuhr (Ref. 46) 
have developed influence coefficients for uniform pressure and for edge loads and 
moments. Shells with central cutouts are also included as are loads and moments on the 
edge of the cutouts. Many graphs as well as tabulated data are presented, which permit 
the solution of a wide variety of problems by superposition.
Cheng and Angsirikul (Ref. 80) present the results of an elasticity solution for edge-
loaded spherical domes with thick walls and with thin walls.
Conical Shells
Exact solutions to the differential equations for both long and short thin-walled trun-
cated conical shells are described in Refs. 30, 31, 64, and 65. Verifications of these 
expressions by tests are described in Ref. 32, and applications to reinforced cones are 
described in Ref. 33. In Table 13.3, case 4 for long cones, where the loads at one end 
do not influence the displacements at the other, is based on the solution described by 
Taylor (Ref. 65) in which the Kelvin functions and their derivatives are replaced by 
asymptotic formulas involving negative powers of the conical shell parameter k 
(presented here in a modified form):

These asymptotic formulas will give three-place accuracy for the Kelvin functions for 
all values of k > 5. To appreciate this fully, one must understand that a truncated thin-
walled cone with an R t
/  ratio of 10 at the small end, a semiapex angle of 80°, and a 
Poisson’s ratio of 0.3 will have a value of k = 4 86
.
. For problems where k is much larger 
than 5, fewer terms can be used in the series, but a few trial calculations will soon indi-
cate the number of terms it is necessary to carry. If only displacements and stresses at 
the loaded edge are needed, the simpler forms of the expressions can be used. (See the 
­example at the end of Sec. 13.4.)
Baltrukonis (Ref. 64) obtains approximations for the influence coefficients which 
give the edge displacements for short truncated conical shells under axisymmetric edge 
loads and moments; this is done by using one-term asymptotic expressions for the Kelvin 
functions. Applying the multiterm asymptotic expressions suggested by Taylor to a 
short truncated conical shell leads to formulas that are too complicated to present in a 
reasonable form. Instead, in Table 13.3, case 5 tabulates numerical coefficients based 
upon this more accurate formulation but evaluated by a computer for the case where 
Poisson’s ratio is 0.3. Because of limited space, only five values of k and six values of the

|/ 2 are presented. If µD is greater than 4, the end loads 
do not interact appreciably and the formulas from case 4 may be used.
Tsui (Ref. 58) derives expressions for deformations of conical shells for which the 
thickness tapers linearly with distance along the meridian; influence coefficients are 
tabulated for a limited range of shell parameters. Blythe and Kyser (Ref. 50) give formu-
las for thinwalled conical shells loaded in torsion.
Toroidal Shells
Simple closed-form solutions for toroidal shells are generally valid for a rather limited 
range of parameters, so that usually it is necessary to resort to numerical solutions. 
Osipova and Tumarkin (Ref. 18) present extensive tables of functions for the asymptotic 
method of solution of the differential equations for toroidal shells; this reference also 
contains an extensive bibliography of work on toroidal shells. Tsui and Massard  
(Ref. 43) tabulate the results of numerical solutions in the form of influence coefficients 
and influence functions for internal pressure and edge loadings on finite portions of 
segments of toroidal shells. Segments having positive and negative gaussian curvatures 
are considered; when both positive and negative curvatures are present in the same 
shell, the solutions can be obtained by matching slopes and deflections at the junction. 
References 29, 51, and 61 describe similar solutions.
Stanley and Campbell (Ref. 77) present the principal test results on 17 full-size, pro-
duction-quality torispherical ends and compare them to theory. Kishida and Ozawa 
(Ref. 78) compare results arrived at from elasticity, photoelasticity, and shell theory. 
References 67 and 68 discuss torispherical shells and present design formulas. See the 
discussion in Sec. 13.2 on this topic.
Jordon (Ref. 53) works with the shell-equilibrium equations of a deformed shell to 
examine the effect of pressure on the stiffness of an axisymmetrically loaded toroidal 
shell.
Kraus (Ref. 44), in addition to an excellent presentation of the theory of thin elastic 
shells, devotes one chapter to numerical analysis under static loadings and another to 
numerical analysis under dynamic loadings. Comparisons are made among results 
obtained by finite-element methods, finite-difference methods, and analytic solutions. 
Numerical techniques, element sizes, and techniques of shell subdivision are discussed 
in detail. It would be impossible to list here all the references describing the finite-
element computer programs available for solving shell problems, but Perrone (Ref. 62) 
has presented an excellent summary and Bushnell (Ref. 63) describes work on shells in 
great detail.
Example 1  Two partial spheres of aluminum are to be welded together as shown in Fig. 13.6 to form 
a pressure vessel to withstand an internal pressure of 200
2
lb/in . The mean radius of each sphere 
is 2 ft, and the wall thickness is 0.5 in. Calculate the stresses at the seam. Given: E = 10 106
2
(
) lb/in  
and ν = 0 33
.
.
Solution   The edge loading will be considered in three parts, as shown in Fig. 13.6(b). The tangential 
edge force T will be applied to balance the internal pressure and, together with the pressure, will cause 
only membrane stresses and the accompanying change in circumferential radius ∆R; this loading will 
produce no rotation of the meridian. Owing to the symmetry of the two shells, there is no resultant 
radial load on the edge, and so Qo is added to eliminate that component of T. Mo is needed to ensure 
no edge rotation.

The maximum stress is a tensile meridional stress of 37 400

weld cross section.
Example 2   To reduce the high stresses in Example 1, it is proposed to add to the joint a reinforcing 
ring of aluminum having a cross-sectional area A. Calculate the optimum area to use.
Solution  If the ring could be designed to expand in circumference by the same amount that the 
sphere does under membrane loading only, then all bending stresses could be eliminated. Therefore, 
let a ring be loaded radially with a load of 2Qo and have the radius increase by 0.00668 in. Since

With this large an area required, the simple expression just given for ∆R R
/  based on a thin ring 
is not adequate; furthermore, there is not enough room to place such a ring external to the shell. An 
internal reinforcement seems more reasonable. If a 6-in-diameter hole is required for passage of the 
fluid, the internal reinforcing disk can have an outer radius of 20.78 in, an inner radius of 3 in, and a 
thickness t1 to be determined. The loading on the disk is shown in Fig. 13.7. The change in the outer 
radius is desired.

Example 3  A truncated cone of aluminum with a uniform wall thickness of 0.050 in and a semiapex 
angle of 55° has a radius of 2 in at the small end and 2.5 in at the large end. It is desired to know 
the radial loading at the small end which will increase the radius by half the wall thickness. Given:

13.4  Thin Multielement Shells of Revolution
The discontinuity stresses at the junctions of shells or shell elements due to changes 
in thickness or shape are not serious under static loading of ductile materials; how-
ever, they are serious under conditions of cyclic or fatigue loading. In Ref. 9, disconti-
nuity stresses are discussed with a numerical example; also, allowable levels of the 
membrane stresses due to internal pressure are established, as well as allowable lev-
els of membrane and bending stresses due to discontinuities under both static and 
cyclic loadings.
Langer (Ref. 10) discusses four modes of failure of a pressure vessel—bursting 
due to general yielding, ductile tearing at a discontinuity, brittle fracture, and creep 
­rupture—and the way in which these modes are affected by the choice of material and 
wall thickness; he also compares pressure-vessel codes of several countries. Zaremba  
(Ref. 47) and Johns and Orange (Ref. 48) describe in detail the techniques for accurate 
deformation matching at the intersections of axisymmetric shells. See also Refs. 74 
and 75.
The following example illustrates the use of the formulas in Tables 13.1–13.3 to 
determine discontinuity stresses.
Example  The vessel shown in quarter longitudinal section in Fig. 13.8(a) consists of a cylindrical 
shell (R = 24 in and t = 0 633
.
in) with conical ends (α = 45° and t = 0 755
.
in). The parts are 
welded together, and the material is steel, for which E = 30 106
2
(
) lb/in  and ν = 0 25
.
. It is required to 
determine the maximum stresses at the junction of the cylinder and cone due to an internal pressure 
of 300
2
lb/in . (This vessel corresponds to one for which the results of a supposedly precise analysis 
and experimentally determined stress values are available. See Ref. 17.)

These stress values are in substantial agreement with the computed and experimental values cited 
in Refs. 17 and 26. Note that the radial deflections are much less than the wall thicknesses. See the 
discussion in the third paragraph of Sec. 13.3.
In the problem just solved by the method of deformation matching only two shells 
met at their common circumference. The method, however, can be extended to cases 
where more than two shells meet in this manner. The primary source of difficulty 
encountered when setting up the equations to carry out such a solution is the rigor 
needed when labeling the several edge loads and the establishment of the proper signs 
for the radial and rotational deformations. An additional problem arises when the sev-
eral shells intersect not at a single circumference but at two or more closely spaced 
circumferences.

Figure 13.9 illustrates two conical shells and a spherical shell joined together by a 
length of cylindrical shell. The length of this central cylinder is a critical dimension in 
determining how the cylinder is treated. If the length is small enough for a given radius 
and wall thickness, it may be sufficient to treat it as a narrow ring whose cross section 
deflects radially and rotates with respect to the original meridian but whose cross sec-
tion does not change shape. For an example as to how these narrow rings are treated 
see Sec. 11.9. For a longer cylinder the cross section does change shape and it is treated 
as a short cylinder, using expressions from Table 13.2. Here there are two circumfer-
ences where slopes and deflections are to be matched but the loads on each end of the 
cylinder influence the deformations at the other end. Finally, if the cylinder is long 
enough, λl > 6, for example, the ends are far enough apart so that two separate prob-
lems may be solved.
Table 13.3 presents formulas and tabulated data for several combinations of thin 
shells of revolution and thin circular plates joined two at a time at a common circumfer-
ence. All shells are assumed long enough so that the end interactions can be neglected. 
Loadings include axial load, a loading due to a rotation at constant angular velocity 
about the central axis, and internal or external pressure where the pressure is either 
constant or varying linearly along the axis of the shell. For the pressure loading the 
equations represent the case where the junction of the shells carries no axial loading 
such as when a cylindrical shell carries a frictionless piston which is supported axially 
by structures other than the cylinder walls. The decision to present the pressure loadings in 
this form was based primarily on the ease of presentation. When used for closed pressure vessels, 
the deformations and stresses for the axial load must be superposed on those for the pressure 
loading.
The reasons for presenting the tabulated data in this table are several. (1) In many 
instances one merely needs to know whether the stresses and deformations at such 
discontinuities are important to the safety and longevity of a structure. Using interpola-
tion one can explore quickly the tables of tabulated data to make such a determination. 
(2) The tabulated data also allow those who choose to solve the formulas to verify their 
results.
The basic information in Table 13.4 can be developed as needed from formulas in 
the several preceding tables, but the work has been extended a few steps further by 
modifying the expressions in order to make them useful for shells with somewhat 
thicker walls.
In the sixth edition of this book, correction terms were presented to account for the 
fact that internal pressure loading acts on the inner surface, not at the mid-thickness. For 
external pressure, the proper substitutions are indicated by notes for the several cases.

This has already been accounted for in the general pressure loadings on the several 
shell types, but there is an additional factor to account for at the junction of the shells. 
In Fig. 13.10(a), the internal pressure is shown acting all the way to the hypothetical end 
of the left-hand shell. The general equations in Table 13.1 assume this to be the case, 
and the use of these equations in Table 13.4 makes this same assumption. The correc-
tion terms in the sixth edition of this book added or subtracted, depending upon the 
signs of α1, α2, and q, the pressure loading over the length x shown in Fig. 13.10(b). 
These corrections included the effects of the radial components, the axial components, 
and the moments about point A of this local change in loading. The complexity of these 
corrections may seem out of proportion to the benefits derived, and, depending upon 
their needs, users will have to decide whether or not to include them in their calcula-
tions. To assist users in making this decision, the following example will compare 
results with and without the correction terms and show the relative effect of using only 
the radial component of the change in the local pressure loading at the junction of a 
cone and cylinder.
Example  For this example, the pressurized shell is that of the previous example shown in Fig. 13.8. 
The calculations for that example were carried out using equations from Tables 13.1 and 13.3. The 
stresses in the cylinder at the junction are given at the end of the solution, and the radial deflection 
and the rotation at the junction can be calculated from the expressions given just before the stress 
calculations. The following results table lists these stresses and deflections in column [1]. As stated 
above, the equations used in Table 13.4 to solve for the shell junction stresses were those given in 
Tables 13.1–13.3, but modified somewhat to make them more accurate for shells with thicker walls. 
Using cases 2a and 2b from Table 13.4 gives the results shown in columns [2]–[7] in the results table.

lb. All of the stresses in 
the results table are those found in the cylinder at the junction. Column [3] gives data for the internal 
pressure loading with no correction factors and column [4] is the sums for the axial load and internal 
pressure, columns [2] plus [3]. Column [5] is for the internal pressure corrected for the change in 
loading at the joint. Column [7] is the difference in the numbers of columns [4] and [6], and gives the 
changes due to the correction factors in Table 13.4.
Column [8] shows the changes due to the radial component of the correction in the joint loading 
which are calculated as follows. Figure 13.11(a) shows the joint being considered, with the dimensions.

Results Table (stresses in lb/in2, deflection in inches, rotation in radians)
Most shell intersections have a common circumference, identified by the radius RA, and 
defined as the intersection of the midsurfaces of the shells. If the two shells have meridional 
slopes which differ substantially at this intersection, the shape of the joint is easily described. 
See Fig. 13.12(a). If, however, these slopes are very nearly the same and the shell thicknesses 
differ appreciably, the intersection of the two midsurfaces could be far away from an actual 
joint, and the midthickness radius must be defined for each shell. See Fig. 13.12(b).

For this reason there are two sets of correction terms based on these two joint con-
tours. All correction terms are treated as external loads on the right-hand member. The 
appropriate portion of this loading is transferred back to the left-hand member by small 
changes in the radial load V1 and the moment M1 which are found by equating the 
deformations in the two shells at the junction. In each case the formulas for the stresses 
at the junction are given only for the left-hand member. Stresses are computed on the 
assumption that each member ends abruptly at the joint with the end cross section nor-
mal to the meridian. No stress concentrations are considered, and no reduction in stress 
due to any added weld material or joint reinforcement has been made. The examples 
show how such corrections can be made for the stresses.
While the discussion above has concentrated primarily on the stresses at or very 
near the junction of the members, there are cases where stresses at some distance from 
the junction can be a source of concern. Although a toroidal shell is not included in 
Table 13.4, the presence of large circumferential compressive stress in the toroidal 
region of a torispherical head on a pressure vessel is known to create buckling insta-
bilities when such a vessel is subjected to internal pressure. Section 15.4 describes this 
problem and others of a similar nature such as a truncated spherical shell under axial 
tension.
Example 1   The shell consisting of a cone and a partial sphere shown in Fig. 13.13 is subjected to an 
internal pressure of 500

stress components at the inside surface of the junction are required. Use E = 7 106

In this example the junction meridians are tangent and the inside surface is smooth, so there are no 
correction terms to consider. Had the radii and the thicknesses been such that the welded junction 
had an internal step, either abrupt or tapered, the internal pressure acting upon this step would be 
accounted for by the appropriate correction terms (see the next example).

. . A check of these values against the tabulated constants shows that 
reasonable values could have been obtained by interpolation. At the junction the shell moves outward 
a distance of 0.0837 cm, and the upper meridian as shown in Fig. 13.13 rotates 0.0056 rad clockwise. 
On the inside surface of the junction the circumferential stress is 15 164
2
,
N/cm  and the meridional 
stress is 10 531
2
,
N/cm .
As should have been expected by the smooth transition from a conical to a spherical shell of the 
same thickness, the bending stresses are very small. In the next example the smooth inside surface 
will be retained but the cone and sphere will be different in thickness, and external pressure will  
be applied to demonstrate the use of the terms which correct for the pressure loading on the step in 
the wall thickness at the junction.
Example 2   The only changes from Example 1 will be to make the pressure external at 1000
2
N/cm  
and to increase the cone thickness to 4 cm and the sphere thickness to 2 cm. The smooth inside surface 
will be retained. If the correction terms are not used in this example, the external pressure will be 
presumed to act on the outer surface of the cone up to the junction and on the external spherical surface 
of the sphere. There will be no consideration given for the external pressure acting upon the 2-cm-wide 
external shoulder at the junction. The correction terms treat the additional axial and radial loadings 
and the added moment due to this pressure loading on the shoulder. If a weld fillet were used at the 
junction, the added pressure loading would be the same, so the correction terms are still applicable 
but no consideration is made for the added stiffness due to the extra material in the weld fillet. If  
the meridians for the cone and for the sphere intersect at an angle more than about 5°, a different 
correction term is used. This second correction term assumes that no definite step occurs on either the 
inner or the outer surface. See the discussion in Sec. 13.4 related to Fig. 13.12.

5 and the cone parameters are within the acceptable range for use with the equations. In a similar 
manner the parameters for the sphere are found to be within the range for which the equations are 
acceptable. Repeating the calculations as was done for the first example, with and without correction 
terms, one finds the following stresses:

The effect of the correction terms is apparent but does not cause large changes in the larger stresses 
or the deformations. Summing the values for cases 6a with correction terms and for 6b gives the desired 
results as follows. The radial deflection at the junction is 0.0696 cm inward, the upper meridian rotates 
0.00069 rad clockwise, on the inside of the junction the circumferential stress is -12 504

N/cm , and 
the meridional stress is -8497

Example 3  The vessel shown in Fig. 13.15 is conical with a flat-plate base supported by an annular line 
load at a radius of 35 in. The junction deformations and the meridional and circumferential stresses on the 
outside surface at the junction of the cone and plate are to be found. The only loading to be considered is 
the hydrostatic loading due to the water contained to a depth of 50 in. Use E = 10 106

13.5  Thin Shells of Revolution under External Pressure
All formulas given in Tables 13.1 and 13.3 for thin vessels under distributed pressure 
are for internal pressure, but they will apply equally to cases of external pressure if q 
is given a negative sign. The formulas in Table 13.2 for distributed pressure are for 
external pressure in order to correspond to similar loadings for beams on elastic foun-
dations in Chap. 8. It should be noted with care that the application of external pres-
sure may cause an instability failure due to stresses lower than the elastic limit, and in 
such a case the formulas in this chapter do not apply. This condition is discussed in 
Chap. 15, and formulas for the critical pressures or stresses producing instability are 
given in Table 15.2.
A vessel of moderate thickness may collapse under external pressure at stresses just 
below the yield point, its behavior being comparable to that of a short column. The 
problem of ascertaining the pressure that produces failure of this kind is of special inter-
est in connection with cylindrical vessels and pipe. For external loading such as that in 
Table 13.1, case 1c, the external collapsing pressure can be given by

In Refs. 8 and 9, charts are given for designing vessels under external ­pressure.
A special instability problem should be considered when designing long cylindri-
cal vessels or even relatively short corrugated tubes under internal pressure. Haringx 
(Refs. 54 and 55) and Flügge (Ref. 5) have shown that vessels of this type will buckle 
laterally if the ends are restrained against longitudinal displacement and if the prod-
uct of the internal pressure and the cross-sectional area reaches the Euler load for the 

S h e l l s  o f  R e v o l u t i o n ;  P r e s s u r e  Ve s s e l s ;  P i p e s

column as a whole. For cylindrical shells this is seldom a critical factor, but for corru-
gated tubes or bellows this is recognized as a so-called squirming instability. To deter-
mine the Euler load for a bellows, an equivalent thin-walled circular cross section can 
be established which will have a radius equal to the mean radius of the bellows and a 
product Et, for which the equivalent cylinder will have the same axial deflection under 
end load as would the bellows. The overall bending moment of inertia I of the very 
thin equivalent cylinder can then be used in the expression P

 for the Euler 
load. In a similar way Seide (Ref. 56) discusses the effect of pressure on the lateral 
bending of a bellows.
Example  A corrugated-steel tube has a mean radius of 5 in, a wall thickness of 0.015 in, and 60 semicircular 
corrugations along its 40-in length. The ends are rigidly fixed, and the internal pressure necessary to 
produce a squirming instability is to be calculated. Given: E = 30 106

13.6  Thick Shells of Revolution
If the wall thickness of a vessel is more than about one-tenth the radius, the meridional 
and hoop stresses cannot be considered uniform throughout the thickness of the wall 
and the radial stress cannot be considered negligible. These stresses in thick vessels, 
called wall stresses, must be found by formulas that are quite different from those used 
in finding membrane stresses in thin vessels.
It can be seen from the formulas for cases 1a and 1b of Table 13.5 that the stress σ2 
at the inner surface of a thick cylinder approaches q as the ratio of outer to inner radius 
approaches infinity. It is apparent therefore that if the stress is to be limited to some 
specified value σ, the pressure must never exceed q = σ, no matter how thick the wall is 
made. To overcome this limitation, the material at and near the inner surface must be 
put into a state of initial compression. This can be done by shrinking on one or more 
jackets (as explained in Sec. 3.12 and in the example therein) or by subjecting the vessel 
to a high internal pressure that stresses the inner part into the plastic range and, when 
removed, leaves residual compression there and residual tension in the outer part. This 
procedure is called autofrettage, or self-hooping. If many successive jackets are superim-
posed on the original tube by shrinking or wrapping, the resulting structure is called a 
multilayer vessel. Such a construction has certain advantages, but it should be noted that 
the formulas for hoop stresses are based on the assumption that an isotropic material is 
used. In a multilayered vessel the effective radial modulus of elasticity is less than the 
tangential modulus, and in consequence the hoop stress at and near the outer wall is 
less than the formula would indicate; therefore, the outer layers of material contribute 
less to the strength of the vessel than might be supposed.
Cases 1e and 1f in Table 13.5 represent radial body-force loading, which can be 
superimposed to give results for centrifugal loading, etc. (see Sec. 16.2). Case 1f is 
directly applicable to thick-walled disks with embedded electrical conductors used to 
generate magnetic fields. In many such cases the magnetic field varies linearly through 
the wall to zero at the outside. If there is a field at the outer turn, cases 1e and 1f can be 
superimposed in the necessary proportions.
The tabulated formulas for elastic wall stresses are accurate for both thin and thick 
vessels, but formulas for predicted yield pressures do not always agree closely with 
experimental results (Refs. 21, 34–37, and 39). The expression for qy given in Table 13.5 
is based on the minimum strain-energy theory of elastic failure. The expression for 
bursting pressure

(13.6-1)
commonly known as the mean diameter formula, is essentially empirical but agrees rea-
sonably well with experiment for both thin and thick cylindrical vessels and is conve-
nient to use. For very thick vessels the formula
	
q

(13.6-2)
is preferable. Greater accuracy can be obtained by using with this formula a multiply-
ing factor that takes into account the strain-hardening properties of the material  
(Refs. 10, 20, and 37). With the same objective, Faupel (Ref. 39) proposes (with different 
notation) the formula

A rather extensive discussion of bursting pressure is given in Ref. 38, which pres-
ents a tabulated comparison between bursting pressures as calculated by a number of 
different formulas and as determined by actual experiment.
Example  At the powder chamber, the inner radius of a 3-in gun tube is 1.605 in and the outer radius 
is 2.425 in. It is desired to shrink a jacket on this tube to produce a radial pressure between the tube 
and jacket of 7600
2
lb/in . The outer radius of this jacket is 3.850 in. It is required to determine  
the difference between the inner radius of the jacket and the outer radius of the tube in order to 
produce the desired pressure, calculate the stresses in each part when assembled, and calculate the 
stresses in each part when the gun is fired, generating a powder pressure of 32 000
2
,
lb/in .
Solution   Using the formulas for Table 13.5, case 1c, it is found that for an external pressure of 
7600
2
lb/in , the stress σ2 at the outer surface of the tube is -19 430
2

lb/in , the stress σ2 at the inner 
surface is -27 050

of 7600

lb/in , the stress σ2 at the inner surface of the jacket is +17 630
2

lb/in , the stress σ2 at  
the outer surface is +10 050
2
,
lb/in , and the change in inner radius ∆b = +0 001615

in. (In making 
these calculations the inner radius of the jacket is assumed to be 2.425 in.) The initial difference between 
the inner radius of the jacket and the outer radius of the tube must be equal to the sum of the radial 
deformations they suffer, or 0 001385

The stresses produced by the powder pressure are calculated at the inner surface of the tube, at the

are then superimposed on those found previously. The calculations are as follows:

13.7  Pipe on Supports at Intervals
For a pipe or cylindrical tank supported at intervals on saddles or pedestals and filled 
or partly filled with liquid, the stress analysis is difficult and the results are rendered 
uncertain by doubtful boundary conditions. Certain conclusions arrived at from a study 
of tests (Refs. 11 and 12) may be helpful in guiding design. See also Ref. 75.
	
1.	 For a circular pipe or tank supported at intervals and held circular at the 
supports by rings or bulkheads, the ordinary theory of flexure is applicable if 
the pipe is completely filled.
	
2.	 If the pipe is only partially filled, the cross section at points between supports 
becomes out of round and the distribution of longitudinal fiber stress is neither 
linear nor symmetrical across the section. The highest stresses occur for the 
half-full condition; then the maximum longitudinal compressive stress and the 
maximum circumferential bending stresses occur at the ends of the horizontal 
diameter, the maximum longitudinal tensile stress occurs at the bottom, and 
the longitudinal stress at the top is practically zero. According to theory (Ref. 4), 
the greatest of these stresses is the longitudinal compression, which is equal to 
the maximum longitudinal stress for the full condition divided by
K
L
R
t
R
=





/
	
	 where R = pipe radius, t = thickness, and L = span. The maximum circumferential 
stress is about one-third of this. Tests (Ref. 11) on a pipe having K = 1 36
.
 showed 
a longitudinal stress that is somewhat less and a circumferential stress that is 
considerably greater than indicated by this theory.
	
3.	 For an unstiffened pipe resting in saddle supports, there are high local stresses, 
both longitudinal and circumferential, adjacent to the tips of the saddles. These 
stresses are less for a large saddle angle β (total angle subtended by arc of 
contact between pipe and saddle) than for a small angle, and for the ordinary 
range of dimensions they are practically independent of the thickness of the 
saddle, i.e., its dimension parallel to the pipe axis. For a pipe that fits the saddle 
well, the maximum value of these localized stresses will probably not exceed 
that indicated by the formula

.
.
(
)
β
	
	 where β is in degrees. This stress is almost wholly due to circumferential 
bending and occurs at points about 15° above the saddle tips.
	
4.	 The maximum value of P the pipe can sustain is about 2.25 times the value that 
will produce a maximum stress equal to the yield point of the pipe material, 
according to the formula given above.
	
5.	 The comments in conclusion 3 above are based on the results of tests performed 
on very thin-walled pipe. Evces and O’Brien in Ref. 73 describe similar tests on 
thicker-walled ductile-iron pipe for which R t
/  does not normally exceed 50. 
They found that optimum saddle angles lie in the range 90

 and that 
for R t

k =

.
.
(
)
β
	
	 The maximum stress will be located within ±15° of the tip if the pipe fits the 
saddle well.
	
6.	 For a pipe supported in flexible slings instead of on rigid saddles, the maximum 
local stresses occur at the points of tangency of sling and pipe section; in general, 
they are less than the corresponding stresses in the saddle-supported pipe but 
are of the same order of magnitude.
A different but closely related support system for horizontal cylindrical tanks con-
sists of a pair of longitudinal line loads running the full length of the vessel. If the tank 
wall is thin, accounting for the deformations, which are normally ignored in standard 
stress formulas, it shows that the stresses are significantly lower. Cook in Ref. 79 uses a 
nonlinear analysis to account for deformations and reports results for various positions 
of the supports, radius/thickness ratios, and depths of fill in the tank.

Notation: Vo, H, and p = unit loads (force per unit length); q = unit pressure (force per unit area); Mo = unit applied couple (force-length per unit 
length); all loads are positive as shown. At a distance x from the left end, the following quantities are defined: V = meridional radial shear, positive 
when acting outward on the right hand portion; M = meridional bending moment, positive when compressive on the outside; ψ = meridional 
slope (radians), positive when the deflection increases with x ; y = radial deflection, positive outward. s1 and s2 = meridional and circumferential 
membrane stresses; positive when tensile; s′1 and s′2 = meridional and circumferential bending stresses, positive when tensile on the outside; τ = 
meridional radial shear stress; E = modulus of elasticity; ν = Poisson’s ratio; R = mean radius; t = wall thickness.
The following constants and functions are hereby defined in order to permit condensing the tabulated formulas which follow:

Notation: RA = radius of common circumference; ∆RA is the radial deflection of the common circumference, positive outward; ψA is the rotation of the meridian at the common 
circumference, positive as indicated. The notation used in Tables 11.2 and 13.1–13.3 is retained where possible with added subscripts 1 and 2 used for left and right members, 
respectively, when needed for clarification. There are some exceptions in using the notation from the other tables when differences occur from one table to another.

Note: The use of joint load correction terms LTAC and LTBC depends upon the accuracy desired and the relative values of the thicknesses and the radii and the cone angle a. Read Sec. 13.4 
carefully. For thin-walled shells, R t
/ > 10 at the junction, they can be neglected.
*If the conical shell increases in radius away from the junction, substitute -a for a in all the formulas above and in those used from case 4, Table 13.3.

5c. Hydrostatic internal* 
pressure q1 at the junction 
if 
µ > 4† at the position 
of zero pressure. If 
µ < 4 
at this position, the 
discontinuity in pressure 
gradient introduces 
deformations at the 
junction.
Note: There is no axial load 
on the junction. An axial 
load on the left end of the 
left cone balances any axial 
component of the pressure 
on the left cone, and an 
axial load on the right end 
of the right cone balances 
the axial component of the 
pressure on the right cone 
and on the joint.

Note: The use of joint load correction terms LTAC and LTBC depends upon the accuracy desired and the relative values of the thicknesses and the radii. Read Sec. 13.4 carefully. For  
thin-walled shells, R t
/ > 10, they can be neglected.
*If the conical shell increases in radius away from the junction, substitute −a  for a for the cone in all of the appropriate formulas above and in those used from case 4, Table 13.3.
†The second subscript is added to refer to the right-hand shell.

6a. Internal* pressure q
Note: There is no axial load on the 
junction. An axial load on the left 
end of the cone balances any axial 
component of the pressure on the 
cone, and an axial load on the right 
end of the sphere balances any 
axial component of the pressure on 
the sphere and on the joint. For an

6c. Hydrostatic internal* pressure q1 at the 
junction when 
µ > 4† at the position 
of zero pressure. If 
µ < 4 at this 
position, the discontinuity in pressure 
gradient introduces small deformations 
at the junction.
Note: There is no axial load on the 
junction. An axial load on the left end of 
the cone balances any axial component 
of the pressure on the cone, and an 
axial load on the right end of the sphere 
balances any axial component of the 
pressure on the sphere and on the 
joint.

Note: The use of joint load correction terms LTAC and LTBC depends upon the accuracy desired and the relative values of the thicknesses and the radii. Read Sec. 13.4 carefully. For thin-
walled shells, R t
/ > 10, they can be neglected.
*Note: If the conical shell increases in radius away from the junction, substitute −a for a for the cone in all of the appropriate formulas above and in those used from 
case 4, Table 13.3.

Note: The use of joint load correction terms LTAC and LTBC depends upon the accuracy desired and the relative values of the thicknesses and the radii. Read Sec. 13.4 carefully. For thin-
walled shells, R t
/ > 10 , they can be neglected.
*The second subscript refers to the left-hand (1) or right-hand (2) shell.
See cases 8a–8d for  
these load terms.

Selected Values
8a. Internal pressure* q
Note: There is no axial load on 
the junction. An axial load on 
the left end of the left sphere 
balances any axial component of 
the pressure on the left sphere, 
and an axial load on the right end 
of the right sphere balances any 
axial component of the pressure 
on the right sphere and on the 
joint. For an enclosed pressure

Bodies under Direct Bearing 
and Shear Stress
14.1  Stress Due to Pressure between Elastic Bodies
The stresses caused by the pressure between elastic bodies are of importance in connec-
tion with the design or investigation of ball and roller bearings, gears, trunnions, expan-
sion rollers, track stresses, etc. Hertz (Ref. 1) developed the mathematical theory for the 
surface stresses and deformations produced by pressure between curved bodies, and 
the results of his analysis are supported by experiment. Formulas based on this theory 
give the maximum compressive stresses, which occur at the center of the surfaces of 
contact, but not the maximum shear stresses, which occur in the interiors of the com-
pressed parts, nor the maximum tensile stress, which occurs at the boundary of the 
contact area and is normal thereto.
Both surface and subsurface stresses were studied by Belajef (Refs. 28 and 29), and 
some of his results are cited in Ref. 6. A tabulated summary of surface and subsurface 
stresses, greatly facilitating calculation, is given in Ref. 33. For a cylinder on a plane 
and for crossed cylinders Thomas and Hoersch (Ref. 2) investigated mathematically 
surface compression and internal shear and checked the calculated value of the latter 
experimentally. The stresses due to the pressure of a sphere on a plate (Ref. 3) and of 
a cylinder on a plate (Ref. 4) have also been investigated by photoelasticity. The 
deformation and contact area for a ball in a race were measured by Whittemore and 
Petrenko (Ref. 8) and compared with the theoretical values. Additionally, investiga-
tions have considered the influence of tangential loading combined with normal 
loading (Refs. 35, 47–49, and 58).
In Table 14.1, formulas are given for the elastic stress and deformation produced by 
pressure between bodies of various forms, and for the dimensions of the circular, 
elliptical, or rectangular area of contact formed by the compressed surfaces. Except 
where otherwise indicated, these equations are based on Hertz’s theory, which assumes 
the length of the cylinder and dimensions of the plate to be infinite. For a very short 
cylinder and for a plate having a width less than five or six times that of the contact area 
or a thickness less than five or six times the depth to the point of maximum shear stress, 
the actual stresses may vary considerably from the values indicated by the theory (see 
Refs. 4, 45, and 50). Tu (Ref. 50) discusses the stresses and deformations for a plate 
pressed between two identical elastic spheres with no friction; graphs are also presented. 
Pu and Hussain (Ref. 51) consider the unbonded contact between a flat plate and an 

704	
C h a p t e r  F o u r t e e n
elastic half-space when a normal load is applied to the plate. Graphs of the contact radii 
are presented for a concentrated load and two distributed loadings on circular areas.
Hertz (Ref. 1) based his work on the assumption that the contact area was small 
compared with the radius of the ball or cylinder; Goodman and Keer (Ref. 52) compare 
the work of Hertz with a solution which permits the contact area to be larger, such as 
the case when the negative radius of one surface is only very slightly larger (1.01–1) 
than the positive radius of the other. Cooper (Ref. 53) presents some reformulated hert-
zian coefficients in a more easily interpolated form and also points out some numerical 
errors in the coefficients originally published by Hertz. Dundurs and Stippes (Ref. 54) 
discuss the effect of Poisson’s ratio on contact stress problems.
The use of the formulas of Table 14.1 is illustrated in the example at the end of this 
section. The general formula for case 4 can be used, as in the example, for any contact-
stress problems involving any geometrically regular bodies except parallel cylinders, 
but for bearing calculations use should be made of charts such as those given in Refs. 33 
and 34, which not only greatly facilitate calculations but provide for influences not 
taken into account in the formulas.
Because of the very small area involved in what initially approximates a point or line 
contact, contact stresses for even light loads are very high; but as the formulas show, the 
stresses do not increase in proportion to the loading. Furthermore, because of the facts 
that the stress is highly localized and triaxial, the actual stress intensity can be very high 
without producing apparent damage. To make use of the Hertz formulas for purposes of 
design or safe-load determination, it is necessary to know the relationship between theo-
retical stresses and likelihood of failure, whether from excessive deformation or fracture. 
In discussing this relationship, it is convenient to refer to the computed stress as the Hertz 
stress, whether the elastic range has been exceeded or not. Some of the available informa-
tion showing the Hertz stress corresponding to loadings found to be safe and to loadings 
that produced excessive deformations or fracture may be summarized as follows.

Here (and in subsequent equations) p is the load per linear inch in pounds, d is the 
diameter of the cylinder in inches, and σ y is the tensile yield point of the steel in the 
roller or plate, whichever is lower. If σ y is taken as 32 000

and decreases as d-¼ to 50,900 at d = 125 in. See Ref. 10.
Wilson (Refs. 7, 11, and 32) carried out several series of static and slow-rolling 
tests on large rollers. From static tests on rollers of medium-grade cast steel having 
diameters of 120–720 in, he concluded that the load per linear inch required to

110 , provided the bearing plates were 3 in thick or more. He found that p 
increased with the axial length of the roller up to a length of 6 in, after which it 
remained practically constant (Ref. 32). Slow-rolling tests (Ref. 11) undertaken to 
determine the load required to produce a permanent elongation or spread of

in/in in the bearing plate led to the empirical formula

for rollers with d > 120 in. Wilson’s tests indicated that the average pressure on the area 
of contact required to produce set was greater for small rollers than for large rollers, and 
that there was little difference in bearing capacity under static and slow-rolling condi-
tions, though the latter showed more tendency to produce surface deterioration.
Jensen (Ref. 4), making use of Wilson’s test results and taking into account the 
three-dimensional aspect of the problem, proposed for the load-producing set the

Whittemore (Ref. 8) found that the elastic limit load for a flexible roller of 
hardened steel (tensile strength about 265 000

lb/in ) tested between slightly hard-
ened races corresponded to a Hertz stress of about 436 000

before the races.
Sphere
Tests reported in Whittemore and Petrenko (Ref. 8) gave, for balls 1, 1¼, and 1½ in in 
diameter, tested between straight races, Hertz stresses of 239,000, 232,000, and 
212 000

were of steel having sclerescope hardness of 60–68, and the races were of approximately 
the same hardness. The critical strain usually occurred first in the races.
From the results of crushing tests of a sphere between two similar spheres, SKF 
derived the empirical formula P

pounds and d is the diameter of the sphere in inches. The test spheres were made of 
steel believed to be of hardness 64–66 Rockwell C, and the formula corresponds to 
a Hertz stress of about 4 000 000

Knife-Edge
Knife-edge pivots are widely used in scales and balances, and if accuracy is to be main-
tained, the bearing loads must not cause excessive deformation. It is impossible for a 
truly sharp edge to bear against a flat plane without suffering plastic deformation, and 
so pivots are not designed on the supposition that the contact stresses will be elastic; 
instead, the maximum load per inch consistent with the requisite degree of accuracy in 
weighing is determined by experience or by testing. In Wilson et al. (Ref. 9), the National 

706	
C h a p t e r  F o u r t e e n
Bureau of Standards is quoted as recommending that for heavy service the load per 
linear inch should not exceed 5000 lb/in for high-carbon steels or 6000 for special alloy 
steels; for light service the values can be increased to 6000 and 7000, respectively. In the 
tests described in Ref. 9, the maximum load that could be sustained without damage—
the so-called critical load—was defined as the load per linear inch that produced an 
increase in the edge width of 0.0005 in or a sudden increase in the load rate of vertical 
deformation. The two methods gave about the same results when the bearing was 
harder than the pivot, as it should be for good operation. The conclusions drawn from 
the reported tests may be summarized as follows.
The bearing value of a knife-edge or pivot varies approximately with the wedge 
angle for angles of 30°
°
-120 , the bearing value of a flat pivot varies approximately 
with the width of the edge for widths of 0.004–0.04 in, and the bearing value of 
pivots increases with the hardness for variations in hardness of 45–60 on the 
Rockwell C scale. Successive applications of a load less than the critical load will 
cause no plastic flow; the edge of a pivot originally sharp will increase in width 
with the load, but no further plastic deformation is produced by successive appli-
cations of the same or smaller loads. The application of a load greater than the 
critical load will widen the edge at the first application, but additional applications 
of the same load will not cause additional flow; the average unit pressure on 90° 
pivots having a hardness represented by Rockwell C numbers of 50–60 is about

–
lb/in  at the critical load. This critical unit pressure appears to be 
independent of the width of the edge but increases with the pivot angle and the 
hardness of the material (Ref. 9).
These tests and the quoted recommendations relate to applications involving 
heavy loads (thousands of pounds) and reasonable accuracy. For light loads and 
extreme accuracy, as in analytical balances, the pressures are limited to much smaller 
values. Thus, in Ref. 39, on the assumptions that an originally sharp edge indents the 
bearing and that the common surface becomes cylindrical, it is stated that the radius of 
the loaded edge must not exceed 0 25
.

accuracy is to be attained, and that the corresponding loading would be about

lb/in  of contact area.
Dynamic Conditions
If the motion involved is a true rolling motion without any slip, then under conditions 
of slow motion (expansion rollers, bascules, etc.) the stress conditions are comparable 
with those produced by static loading. This is indicated by a comparison of the conclu-
sions reached in Ref. 7, where the conditions are truly static, with those reached in 
Ref. 11, where there is a slow-rolling action. If there is even a slight amount of slip, how-
ever, the conditions are very much more severe and failure is likely to occur through 
mechanical wear. The only guide to proper design against wear is real or simulated 
service testing (Refs. 24, 41, and 46).
When the motion involved is at high speed and produces cyclic loading, as in 
ball and roller bearings, fatigue is an important consideration. A great many tests 
have been made to determine the fatigue properties of bearings, especially ball 
bearings, and such tests have been carried out to as many as 1 billion cycles and 
with Hertz stresses up to 750 000
2
,
lb/in  (Ref. 37). The number of cycles to damage 
(either spalling or excessive deformation) has been found to be inversely propor-
tional to the cube of the load for point contact (balls) and to the fourth power for 

B o d i e s  u n d e r  D i r e c t  B e a r i n g  a n d  S h e a r  S t r e s s 	
707
line contact; this would be inversely proportional to the ninth and eighth powers, 
respectively, of the Hertz stress. Styri (Ref. 40) found the cycles to failure to vary as 
the ninth power of the Hertz stress and was unable to establish a true endurance 
limit. Some of these tests show that ball bearings can run for a great number of 
cycles at very high stresses; for example, ½-in balls of SAE 52,100 steel (RC 63–64) 
withstood 17,500,000 cycles at a stress of 174 000
2
,
lb/in  before 10% failures occurred, 
and withstood 700,000,000 cycles at that stress before 90% failures occurred.
One difficulty in correlating different tests on bearings is the difference in criteria 
for judging damage; some experimenters have defined failure as a certain permanent 
deformation, others as visible surface damage through spalling. Palmgren (Ref. 36) 
states that a permanent deformation at any one contact point of rolling element and 
bearing ring combined equal to 0.001 times the diameter of the rolling element has no 
significant influence on the functioning of the bearing. In the tests of Ref. 37, spalling of 
the surface was taken as the sign of failure; this spalling generally originated on plates 
of maximum shear stress below the surface.
Large-diameter bearings, usually incorporating integral gearing, are heat-treated to 
produce a hardened case to resist wear and fatigue and a tough machinable core. Sague 
in Ref. 56 describes how high subsurface shear stresses have produced yielding in the 
core with subsequent failure of the case due to lack of support.
It is apparent from the foregoing discussion that the practical design of parts that 
sustain direct bearing must be based largely on experience since this alone affords a 
guide as to whether, at any given load and number of stress cycles, there is enough 
deformation or surface damage to interfere with proper functioning. The rated capaci-
ties of bearings and gears are furnished by the manufacturers, with proper allowance 
indicated for the conditions of service and recommendations as to proper lubrication 
(Ref. 38). Valid and helpful conclusions, however, can often be drawn from a compari-
son of service records with calculated stresses.
Example  A ball 1.50 in in diameter, in a race which has a diameter of 10 in and a groove radius of 
0.80 in, is subjected to a load of 2000 lb. It is required to find the dimensions of the contact area, the 
combined deformation of ball and race at the contact, and the maximum compressive stress.

Therefore, the contact area is an ellipse with a major axis of 0.288 in and a minor axis of 0.0526 in.
14.2  Rivets and Riveted Joints
Although the actual state of stress in a riveted joint is complex, it is customary—and experi-
ence shows it is permissible—to ignore such considerations as the stress concentration at the 
edges of rivet holes, unequal division of load among rivets, and nonuniform distribution of 
shear stress across the section of the rivet and of the bearing stress between rivet and plate. 
Simplifying assumptions are made, which may be summarized as follows: (1) The applied 
load is assumed to be transmitted entirely by the rivets, friction between the connected 
plates being ignored; (2) when the centroid of the rivet areas is on the line of action of the 
load, all the rivets of the joint are assumed to carry equal parts of the load if they are of the 
same size, or to be loaded proportionally to their respective section areas if they are of 
different sizes; (3) the shear stress is assumed to be uniformly distributed across the rivet 
section; (4) the bearing stress between plate and rivet is assumed to be uniformly distributed 
over an area equal to the rivet diameter times the plate thickness; (5) the stress in a tension 
member is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the net area; and (6) the stress in a 
compression member is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the gross area.
The design of riveted joints on the basis of these assumptions is the accepted prac-
tice, although none of them is strictly correct and methods of stress calculation that are 
supposedly more accurate have been proposed (Ref. 12).
Details of Design and Limitations
The possibility of secondary failure due to secondary causes, such as the shearing or tear-
ing out of a plate between the rivet and the edge of a plate or between adjacent rivets, the 
bending or insufficient upsetting of long rivets, or tensile failure along a zigzag line when 
rivets are staggered, is guarded against in standard specifications (Ref. 13) by detailed 
rules for edge clearance, maximum grip of rivets, maximum pitch, and computing the net 
width of riveted parts. Provision is made for the use of high-strength bolts in place of 
rivets under certain circumstances (Ref. 42). Joints may be made by welding instead of 
riveting, but the use of welding in conjunction with riveting is not approved on new work; 
the division of the load as between the welds and the rivets would be indeterminate.
Tests on Riveted Joints
In general, tests on riveted joints show that although under working loads the stress 
conditions may be considerably at variance with the usual assumptions, the ultimate 
strength may be closely predicted by calculations based thereon. Some of the other con-
clusions drawn from such tests may be summarized as follows.

B o d i e s  u n d e r  D i r e c t  B e a r i n g  a n d  S h e a r  S t r e s s 	
709
In either lap or double-strap butt joints in very wide plates, the unit tensile 
strength developed by the net section is greater than that developed by the plate 
itself when tested in full width and is practically equal to that developed by narrow 
tension specimens cut from the plate. The rivets in lap joints are as strong relative to 
undriven rivets tested in shear as are the rivets in butt joints. Lap joints bend suffi-
ciently at stresses below the usual design stresses to cause opening of caulked joints 
(Ref. 14).
Although it is frequently specified that rivets shall not be used in tension, tests 
show that hot-driven buttonhead rivets develop a strength in direct tension greater 
than the strength of the rod from which they are made, and that they may be relied 
upon to develop this strength in every instance. Although the initial tension in such 
rivets due to cooling usually amounts to 70% or more of the yield strength, this initial 
tension does not reduce the ability of the rivets to resist an applied tensile load (see also 
Sec. 3.12). Unless a joint is subjected to reversals of primary load, the use of rivets in 
tension appears to be justified; but when the primary load producing shear in the rivets 
is reversed, the reduction in friction due to simultaneous rivet tension may permit slip 
to occur, with possible deleterious effects (Ref. 15).
With respect to the form of the rivet head, the rounded or buttonhead type is stan-
dard; but countersunk rivets are often used, and tests show that these develop the same 
ultimate strength, although they permit much more slip and deformation at working 
loads than do the buttonhead rivets (Ref. 16).
In designing riveted joints in very thin metals, especially the light alloys, it may 
be necessary to take into account factors that are not usually considered in ordinary 
structural-steel work, such as the radial stresses caused at the hole edges by closing 
pressure and the buckling of the plates under rivet pressure (Ref. 17).
Eccentric Loading
When the rivets of a joint are so arranged that the centroid G of the areas of the rivet 
group lies not on the line of action of the load but at a distance e therefrom, the load P 
can be replaced by an equal and parallel load P ′ acting through G and a couple Pe. The 
load on any one of the n rivets is then found by vectorially adding the load P n
/  due to 
P ′ and the load Q due to the couple Pe. This load Q acts normal to the line from G 
to the rivet and is given by the equation Q
PeA r
J
=
1 1/ , where A1 is the area of the rivet in 
question, r1 is its distance from G, and J = ∑Ar2 for all the rivets of the group. When all 
rivets are of the same size, as is usually the case, the formula becomes Q = Per1/∑r2. 
Charts and tables are available which greatly facilitate the labor of the calculation 
involved, and which make possible direct design of the joint without recourse to trial 
and error (Ref. 18). (The direct procedure, as outlined previously, is illustrated in the 
following example.)
The stiffness or resistance to angular displacement of a riveted joint determines the 
degree of fixity that should be assumed in the analysis of beams with riveted ends or of 
rectangular frames. Tests (Ref. 19) have shown that although joints made with wide 
gusset plates are practically rigid, joints made by simply riveting through clip angles 
are not even approximately so. A method of calculating the elastic constraint afforded 
by riveted joints of different types, based on an extensive series of tests, has been pro-
posed by Rathbun (Ref. 20). Brombolich (Ref. 55) describes the use of a finite-element-
analysis procedure to determine the effect of yielding, interference fits, and load 
sequencing on the stresses near fastener holes.

Example  Figure 14.1 represents a lap joint in which three 1-in rivets are used to connect a 15-in channel 
to a plate. The channel is loaded eccentrically as shown. It is required to determine the maximum 
shear stress in the rivets. (This is not, of course, a properly designed joint intended to develop the 
full strength of the channel. It represents a simple arrangement of rivets assumed for the purpose of 
illustrating the calculation of rivet stress due to a moment.)
Solution  The centroid of the rivet areas is found to be at G. The applied load is replaced by an equal 
load through G and a couple equal to

as shown in Fig. 14.1(b). The distances r1 , r2  , and r3 of rivets 1, 2, and 3, respectively, from G are as

14.3  Miscellaneous Cases
In most instances, the stress in bodies subjected to direct shear or pressure is calculated 
on the basis of simplifying assumptions such as are made in analyzing a riveted joint. 
Design is based on rules justified by experience rather than exact theory, and a full dis-
cussion does not properly come within the scope of this book. However, a brief consid-
eration of a number of cases is given here; a more complete treatment of these cases may 
be found in books on machine and structural design and in the references cited.
Pins and Bolts
These are designed on the basis of shear and bearing stress calculated in the same way 
as for rivets. In the case of pins bearing on wood, the allowable bearing stress must be 
reduced to provide for nonuniformity of pressure when the length of bolt is more than

where N is the safe load for the case in question, P is the safe load applied parallel

makes with the direction of the grain (Ref. 21).
Hollow pins and rollers are thick-walled but can be analyzed as circular rings by the 
appropriate use of the formulas of Table 9.2. The loading is essentially as shown in 
Fig. 14.2, and the greatest circumferential stresses, which occur at points 1–4, may be 
found by the formula

Gear Teeth
Gear teeth may be investigated by considering the tooth as a cantilever beam, 
the critical stress being the tensile bending stress at the base. This stress can be 
calculated by the modified Heywood formula for a very short cantilever beam 
(Sec. 8.10) or by a combination of the modified Lewis formula and stress concen-
tration factor given for case 21 in Table 17.1 (see also Refs. 22–24). The allowable 
stress is reduced according to speed of operation by one of several empirical for-
mulas (Ref. 24). Under certain conditions, the bearing stress between teeth may 
become important (especially as this stress affects wear), and this stress may be 
calculated by the formula for case 2b, Table 14.1. The total deformation of the 
tooth, the result of direct compression at the point of contact and of beam deflec-
tion and shear, may be calculated by the formula of case 2b and the methods of 
Sec. 8.1 (Ref. 23).
Keys
Keys are designed for a total shearing force F
T r
=
/  (Fig. 14.3), where T represents 
the torque transmitted. The shear stress is assumed to be uniformly distributed 
over the horizontal section AB, and the bearing stress is assumed to be uniformly 
distributed over half the face. These assumptions lead to the following formulas: 
τ = F Lb
/
; σb

 on top and bottom. Here L is the 
length of the key; in conventional design 4
16
b
L
b
<
<
. As usually made, b
t
≥; hence 
the bearing stress on the sides is greater than that on the top and bottom.
Photoelastic analysis of the stresses in square keys shows that the shear stress is not 
uniform across the breadth b but is greatest at A and B, where it may reach a value two 
to four times the average value (Ref. 25). Undoubtedly the shear stress also varies in 
intensity along the length of the key. The bearing stresses on the surfaces of the key are 
also nonuniform, that on the sides being greatest near the common surface of shaft and 
hub, and that on the top and bottom being greatest near the corners C and D. When 
conservative working stresses are used, however, and the proportions of the key are 
such as have been found satisfactory in practice, the approximate methods of stress 
calculation that have been indicated result in satisfactory design.
Fillet Welds
These are successfully designed on the basis of uniform distribution of shear stress 
on the longitudinal section of least area, although analysis and tests show that there 
is considerable variation in the intensity of shear stress along the length of the fillet 
(Refs. 26 and 27). (Detailed recommendations for the design of welded structural joints 
are given in Ref. 13.)

Screwthreads
The strength of screwthreads is of great importance in the design of joints, where 
the load is transferred to a bolt or stud by a nut. A major consideration is the load 
distribution. The load is not transferred uniformly along the engaged thread length; 
both mathematical analysis and tests show that the maximum load per linear inch 
of thread, which occurs near the loaded face of the nut, is several times as great as 
the average over the engaged length. This ratio, called the thread-load concentration 
factor and denoted by H, is often 2, 3, or even 4 (Ref. 43). The maximum load per 
linear inch on a screwthread is therefore the total load divided by the helical length 
of the engaged screwthread times H. The maximum stress due to this loading can 
be computed by the Heywood–Kelley–Pedersen formula for a short cantilever, as 
given in Sec. 8.10. It is important to note that in some cases the values of k f given in 
the literature are for loading through a nut, and so include H, while in other cases 
(as in rotating-beam tests) this influence is absent. Because of the combined effects 
of reduced area, nonuniform load distribution, and stress concentration, the effi-
ciency of a bolted joint under reversed repeated loading is likely to be quite small. 
In Ref. 28 of Chap. 3, values from 18% (for a 60 000
2
,
lb/in  steel with rolled threads) 
to 6.6% (for a 200 000
2
,
lb/in  steel with machine-cut threads) are cited.
The design of bolted connections has received much study, and an extensive discus-
sion and bibliography are given in Heywood (Chap. 3, Ref. 28) and in some of the 
papers of Ref. 32 of Chap. 3.

Chapter 15
Elastic Stability
15.1  General Considerations
Failure through elastic instability has been discussed briefly in Sec. 3.13, where it was 
pointed out that it may occur when the bending or twisting effect of an applied load is 
proportional to the deformation it produces. In this chapter, formulas for the critical 
load or critical unit stress at which such failure occurs are given for a wide variety of 
members and conditions of loading.
Such formulas can be derived mathematically by integrating the differential equa-
tion of the elastic curve or by equating the strain energy of bending to the work done by 
the applied load in the corresponding displacement of its point of application, the form 
of the elastic curve being assumed when unknown. Of all possible forms of the curve, 
that which makes the critical load a minimum is the correct one; but almost any reason-
able assumption (consistent with the boundary conditions) can be made without gross 
error resulting, and for this reason the strain-energy method is especially adapted to the 
approximate solution of difficult cases. A very thorough discussion of the general prob-
lem, with detailed solutions of many specified cases, is given in Timoshenko and Gere 
(Ref. 1), from which many of the formulas in this chapter are taken. Formulas for many 
cases are also given in Refs. 35 and 36; in addition Ref. 35 contains many graphs of 
numerically evaluated coefficients. 
At one time, most of the problems involving elastic stability were of academic inter-
est only since engineers were reluctant to use compression members so slender as to fail 
by buckling at elastic stresses and danger of corrosion interdicted the use of very thin 
material in exposed structures. The requirements for minimum-weight construction in 
the fields of aerospace and transportation, however, have given great impetus to the 
theoretical and experimental investigation of elastic stability and to the use of parts for 
which it is a governing design consideration.
There are certain definite advantages in lightweight construction, in which stabil-
ity determines strength. One is that since elastic buckling may occur without damage, 
part of a structure—such as the skin of an airplane wing or web of a deep beam—may 
be used safely at loads that cause local buckling, and under these circumstances the 
resistance afforded by the buckled part is definitely known. Furthermore, members 
such as Euler columns may be loaded experimentally to their maximum capacity 
without damage or permanent deformation and subsequently incorporated in a 
structure.

15.2  Buckling of Bars
In Table 15.1, formulas are given for the critical loads on columns, beams, and shafts. In 
general, the theoretical values are in good agreement with test results as long as the 
assumed conditions are reasonably well-satisfied. It is to be noted that even slight 
changes in the amount of end constraint have a marked effect on the critical loads, and 
therefore it is important that such constraint be closely estimated. Slight irregularities in 
form and small accidental eccentricities are less likely to be important in the case of 
columns than in the case of thin plates. For latticed columns or columns with tie plates, 
a reduced value of E may be used, calculated as shown in Sec. 12.3. Formulas for the 
elastic buckling of bars may be applied to conditions under which proportional limit is 
exceeded if a reduced value of E corresponding to the actual stress is used (Ref. 1), but 
the procedure requires a stress-strain diagram for the material and, in general, is not 
practical. 
In Table 15.1, cases 1–3, the tabulated buckling coefficients are worked out for vari-
ous combinations of concentrated and distributed axial loads. Tensile end loads are 
included so that the effect of axial end restraint under axial loading within the column 
length can be considered (see the example at the end of this section). Carter and Gere 
(Ref. 46) present graphs of buckling coefficients for columns with single tapers for vari-
ous end conditions, cross sections, and degrees of taper. Culver and Preg (Ref. 47) inves-
tigate and tabulate buckling coefficients for singly tapered beam-columns in which the 
effect of torsion, including warping restraint, is considered for the case where the load-
ing is by end moments in the stiffer principal plane.
Kitipornchai and Trahair describe (Ref. 55) the lateral stability of singly tapered 
cantilever and doubly tapered simple I-beams, including the effect of warping 
restraint; experimental results are favorably compared with numerical solutions. 
Morrison (Ref. 57) considers the effect of lateral restraint of the tensile flange of a 
beam under lateral buckling; example calculations are presented. Massey and McGuire 
(Ref. 54) present graphs of buckling coefficients for both stepped and tapered canti-
lever beams; good agreement with experiments is reported. Tables of lateral stability 
constants for laminated timber beams are presented in Fowler (Ref. 53) along with 
two design examples.
Clark and Hill (Ref. 52) derive a general expression for the lateral stability of unsym-
metrical I-beams with boundary conditions based on both bending and warping sup-
ports; tables of coefficients as well as nomographs are presented. Anderson and Trahair 
(Ref. 56) present tabulated lateral buckling coefficients for uniformly loaded and end-
loaded cantilevers and center- and uniformly loaded simply supported beams having 
unsymmetric I-beam cross sections; favorable comparisons are made with extensive 
tests on cantilever beams.
The Southwell plot is a graph in which the lateral deflection of a column or any 
other linearly elastic member undergoing a manner of loading which will produce 
buckling is plotted versus the lateral deflection divided by the load; the slope of 
this line gives the critical load. For columns and some frameworks, significant 
deflections do occur within the range where small-deflection theory is applicable. If 
the initial imperfections are such that experimental readings of lateral deflection 
must be taken beyond the small-deflection region, then the Southwell procedure is 
not adequate. Roorda (Ref. 93) discusses the extension of this procedure into the 
nonlinear range.

Bimetallic Beams
Burgreen and Manitt (Ref. 48) and Burgreen and Regal (Ref. 49) discuss the analysis of 
bimetallic beams and point out some of the difficulties in predicting the snap-through 
instability of these beams under changes in temperature. The thermal expansion of the 
support structure is an important design factor.
Rings and Arches
Austin (Ref. 50) tabulates in-plane buckling coefficients for circular, parabolic, and cat-
enary arches for pinned and fixed ends as well as for the three-hinged case; he considers 
cases where the cross section varies with the position in the span as well as the usual 
case of a uniform cross section. Uniform loads, unsymmetric distributed loads, and 
concentrated center loads are considered, and the stiffening effect of tying the arch to 
the girder with columns is also evaluated. (The discussion referenced with the paper 
gives an extensive bibliography of work on arch stability.) 
A thin ring shrunk by cooling and inserted into a circular cavity usually will yield 
before buckling unless the radius/thickness ratio is very large and the elastic-limit 
stress is high. Chicurel (Ref. 51) derives approximate solutions to this problem when the 
effect of friction is considered. He suggests a conservative expression for the no-friction 
condition: P AE
k r
o/
/

.
(
) . , where Po is the prebuckling hoop compressive force, A is

the cross section, and r is the radius of the ring.
Example  A 4-in steel pipe is to be used as a column to carry 8000 lb of transformers centered axially 
on a platform 20 ft above the foundation. The factor of safety FS is to be determined for the following 
conditions, based on elastic buckling of the column:
(a)	 The platform is supported only by the pipe fixed at the foundation.
(b)	 A 3½-in steel pipe is to be slipped into the top of the 4-in pipe a distance of 4 in, welded in place, 
and extended 10 ft to the ceiling above, where it will extend through a close-fitting hole in a steel 
plate.
(c)	 This condition is the same as in (b) except that the 3½-in pipe will be welded solidly into a heavy 
steel girder passing 10 ft above the platform.
Solution  A 4-in steel pipe has a cross-sectional area of 3.174 in2 and a bending moment of inertia of 
7.233 in4. For a 3½ -in pipe these are 2.68 in2 and 4.788 in4, respectively.
(a)	 This case is a column fixed at the bottom and free at the top with an end load only. In Table 15.1,

(c)	 This case is a column fixed at both ends and subjected to an upward load on top and a downward 
load at the platform. The upward load depends to some extent on the stiffness of the girder to 
which the top is welded, and so we can only bracket the actual critical load. If we assume the 
girder is infinitely rigid and permits no vertical deflection of the top, the elongation of the upper 
10 ft would equal the reduction in length of the lower 20 ft.

Therefore, the value of P2 ranges from 91,200 to 289,900 lb, and the factor of safety lies between 
11.4 and 36.2. A reasonable estimate of the rotational and vertical stiffness of the girder will allow 
a good estimate to be made of the actual factor of safety from the values calculated. 
15.3  Buckling of Flat and Curved Plates
In Table 15.2, formulas are given for the critical loads and critical stresses on plates and 
thin-walled members. Because of the greater likelihood of serious geometrical irregu-
larities and their greater relative effect, the critical stresses actually developed by such 
members usually fall short of the theoretical values by a wider margin than in the case 
of bars. The discrepancy is generally greater for pure compression (thin tubes under 
longitudinal compression or external pressure) than for tension and compression com-
bined (thin tubes under torsion or flat plates under edge shear), and increases with the 
thinness of the material. The critical stress or load indicated by any one of the theoreti-
cal formulas should therefore be regarded as an upper limit, approached more or less 
closely according to the closeness with which the actual shape of the member approxi-
mates the geometrical form assumed. In Table 15.2, the approximate discrepancy to be 
expected between theory and experiment is indicated wherever the data available have 
made this possible.
Most of the theoretical analyses of the stability of plates and shells require a numer-
ical evaluation of the resulting equations. Considering the variety of shapes and combi-
nations of shapes as well as the multiplicity of boundary conditions and loading 
combinations, it is not possible in the limited space available to present anything like a 
comprehensive coverage of plate and shell buckling. As an alternative, Table 15.2 
contains many of the simpler loadings and shapes. The following paragraphs and the 
References contain some, but by no means all, of the more easily acquired sources giving 
results in tabular or graphic form that can be applied directly to specific problems. See 
also Refs. 101–104, and 109–111.

Rectangular Plates
Stability coefficients for orthotropic rectangular plates with several combinations of 
boundary conditions and several ratios of the bending stiffnesses parallel to the sides of 
the plate are tabulated in Shuleshko (Ref. 60); these solutions were obtained by reduc-
ing the problem of plate buckling to that of an isotropic bar that is in a state of vibration 
and under tension. Srinivas and Rao (Ref. 63) evaluate the effect of shear deformation 
on the stability of simply supported rectangular plates under edge loads parallel to one 
side; the effect becomes noticeable for h b
/ > 0 05
.
 and is greatest when the loading is 
parallel to the short side.
Skew Plates
Ashton (Ref. 61) and Durvasula (Ref. 64) consider the buckling of skew (parallelogram) 
plates under combinations of edge compression, edge tension, and edge shear. Since 
the loadings evaluated are generally parallel to orthogonal axes and not to both sets 
of the plate edges, we would not expect to find the particular case desired represented 
in the tables of coefficients; the general trend of results is informative.
Circular Plates
Vijayakumar and Joga Rao (Ref. 58) describe a technique for solving for the radial buck-
ling loads on a polar orthotropic annular plate. They give graphs of stability coefficients 
for a wide range of rigidity ratios and for the several combinations of free, simply sup-
ported, and fixed inner and outer edges for the radius ratio (outer to inner) 2:1. Two 
loadings are presented: outer edge only under uniform compression and inner and 
outer edges under equal uniform compression.
Amon and Widera (Ref. 59) present graphs showing the effect of an edge beam on 
the stability of a circular plate of uniform thickness.
Sandwich Plates
There is a great amount of literature on the subject of sandwich construction. References 
38 and 100 and the publications listed in Ref. 39 provide initial sources of information.
15.4  Buckling of Shells
Baker, Kovalevsky, and Rish (Ref. 97) discuss the stability of unstiffened orthotropic 
composite, stiffened, and sandwich shells. They represent data based on theory and 
experiment which permit the designer to choose a loading or pressure with a 90% prob-
ability of no stability failure; the work is extensively referenced. For similar collected 
data see Refs. 41 and 42.
Stein (Ref. 95) discusses some comparisons of theory with experimentation in shell 
buckling. Rabinovich (Ref. 96) describes in some detail the work in structural mechanics, 
including shell stability, in the U.S.S.R. from 1917 to 1957.
In recent years, there have been increasing development and application of the finite-
element method for the numerical solution of shell problems. Navaratna, Pian, and Witmer 
(Ref. 94) describe a finite-element method of solving axisymmetric shell problems where 
the element considered is either a conical frustum or a frustum with a curved meridian; 
examples are presented of cylinders with uniform or tapered walls under axial load, 

728	
C h a p t e r  F i f t e e n
a truncated hemisphere under axial tension, and a conical shell under torsion. Bushnell 
(Ref. 99) presents a very general finite-element program for shell analysis, and Perrone 
(Ref. 98) gives a compendium of such programs. See also Refs. 101 to 108.
Cylindrical and Conical Shells
In general, experiments to determine the axial loads required to buckle cylindrical shells 
yield results that are between one-half and three-fourths of the classical buckling loads 
predicted by theory. The primary causes of these discrepancies are the deviations from 
a true cylindrical form in most manufactured vessels and the inability to accurately 
define the boundary conditions. Hoff (Refs. 67 and 68) shows that removing the in-
plane shear stress at the boundary of a simply supported cylindrical shell under axial 
compression can reduce the theoretical buckling load by a factor of 2 from that pre-
dicted by the more usual boundary conditions associated with a simply supported 
edge. Baruch, Harari, and Singer (Ref. 84) find similar low-buckling loads for simply 
supported conical shells under axial load but for a different modification of the bound-
ary support. Tani and Yamaki (Ref. 83) carry out further work on this problem, includ-
ing the effect of clamped edges.
The random nature of manufacturing deviations leads to the use of the statistical 
approach, as mentioned previously (Ref. 97) and as Hausrath and Dittoe have done for 
conical shells (Ref. 77). Weingarten, Morgan, and Seide (Ref. 80) have developed empir-
ical expressions for lower bounds of stability coefficients for cylindrical and conical 
shells under axial compression with references for the many data they present.
McComb, Zender, and Mikulas (Ref. 44) discuss the effects of internal pressure on 
the bending stability of very thin-walled cylindrical shells. Internal pressure has a sta-
bilizing effect on axially and/or torsionally loaded cylindrical and conical shells. This 
subject is discussed in several references: Seide (Ref. 75), Weingarten (Ref. 76), and 
Weingarten, Morgan, and Seide (Ref. 82) for conical and cylindrical shells; Ref. 97 con-
tains much information on this subject as well.
Axisymmetric snap-buckling of conical shells is discussed by Newman and Reiss 
(Ref. 73), which leads to the concept of the Belleville spring for the case of shallow 
shells. (See also Sec. 11.8.)
External pressure as a cause of buckling is examined by Singer (Ref. 72) for cones 
and by Newman and Reiss (Ref. 73) and Yao and Jenkins (Ref. 69) for elliptic cylinders. 
External pressure caused by pretensioned filament winding on cylinders is analyzed by 
Mikulas and Stein (Ref. 66); they point out that material compressibility in the thickness 
direction is important in this problem.
The combination of external pressure and axial loads on cylindrical and conical 
shells is very thoroughly examined and referenced by Radkowski (Ref. 79) and Wein-
garten and Seide (Ref. 81). The combined loading on orthotropic and stiffened conical 
shells is discussed by Singer (Ref. 74).
Attempts to manufacture nearly perfect shells in order to test the theoretical results 
have led to the construction of thin-walled shells by electroforming; Sendelbeck and 
Singer (Ref. 85) and Arbocz and Babcock (Ref. 91) describe the results of such tests. 
A very thorough survey of buckling theory and experimentation for conical shells 
of constant thickness is presented by Seide (Ref. 78).

Spherical Shells
Experimental work is described by Loo and Evan-Iwanowski on the effect of a concen-
trated load at the apex of a spherical cap (Ref. 90) and the effect of multiple concentrated 
loads (Ref. 89). Carlson, Sendelbeck, and Hoff (Ref. 70) report on the experimental  
study of buckling of electroformed complete spherical shells; they report experimental 
critical pressures of up to 86% of those predicted by theory and the correlation of flaws 
with lower test pressures.
Burns (Ref. 92) describes tests of static and dynamic buckling of thin spherical caps 
due to external pressure; both elastic and plastic buckling are considered and evaluated 
in these tests. Wu and Cheng (Ref. 71) discuss in detail the buckling due to circumferen-
tial hoop compression which is developed when a truncated spherical shell is subjected 
to an axisymmetric tensile load.
Toroidal Shells
Stein and McElman (Ref. 86) derive nonlinear equations of equilibrium and buckling 
equations for segments of toroidal shells; segments that are symmetric with the equator 
are considered for both inner and outer diameters, as well as segments centered at the 
crown. Sobel and Flügge (Ref. 87) tabulate and graph the minimum buckling external 
pressures on full toroidal shells. Almroth, Sobel, and Hunter (Ref. 88) compare favor-
ably the theory in Ref. 87 with experiments they performed.
Corrugated Tubes or Bellows
An instability can develop when a corrugated tube or bellows is subjected to an internal 
pressure with the ends partially or totally restrained against axial displacement. (This 
instability can also occur in very long cylindrical vessels under similar restraints.) For a 
discussion and an example of this effect, see Sec. 13.5.

Dynamic and  
Temperature  
Stresses
16.1  Dynamic Loadings; General Conditions
Dynamic loading was defined in Chap. 3 as any loading during which the parts of the 
body cannot be considered to be in static equilibrium. It was further pointed out that 
two kinds of dynamic loadings can be distinguished as: (1) that in which the body 
has imposed upon it a particular kind of motion involving known accelerations, and 
(2) impact, of which sudden loading may be considered a special case. In the following

16.2  Body in a Known State of Motion
The acceleration a of each particle of mass dm being known, the effective force on each 
particle is dm × a, directed like a. If to each particle a force equal and opposite to the 
effective force were applied, equilibrium would result. If then such reversed effective 
forces are assumed to be applied to all the constituent particles of the body, the body 
may be regarded as being in equilibrium under these forces and the actual forces (loads 
and reactions) that act upon it, and the resulting stresses can be found exactly as for a 
body at rest. The reversed effective forces are imaginary forces exerted on the particles 
but are equal to and directed like the actual reactions the particles exert on whatever 
gives them their acceleration, i.e., in general, on the rest of the body. Since these reac-
tions are due to the inertia of the particles, they are called inertia forces, and the body 
may be thought of as loaded by these inertia forces. Similarly, any attached mass will 
exert on a body inertia forces equal and opposite to the forces which the body has to 
exert on the attached mass to accelerate it.
The results of applying this method of analysis to a number of more or less typical 
problems are given below. In all cases, in finding the accelerations of the particles, it has 
been assumed that the effect of deformation could be ignored, i.e., the acceleration of each 
particle has been found as though the body were rigid. For convenience, stresses, bend-
ing moments, and shears due to inertia forces only are called inertia stresses, moments, 
and shears, respectively; they are calculated as though the body were outside the field of 
gravitation. Stresses, moments, and shears due to balanced forces (including gravity)

When the rod reaches a position where it makes an angle θ with the vertical, it 
is subjected to a positive bending moment (owing to its weight and the inertia 
forces) which has its maximum value at a section a distance 1/3 L from the 
pinned end. This maximum value is M = 1/27 WL sin q. The maximum positive 
inertia shear occurs at the pinned end and is V = ¼ W sin q. The maximum 
negative inertia shear occurs at a section a distance 2/3 L from the pinned end 
and is V = -1/12 W sin q. The axial force at any section x in from the pinned 
end is given by

approximately the conditions existing when a chimney or other slender

For each ring, a is calculated by the formulas of problem 10, using the inner and 
outer radii and the corresponding thicknesses. Then, if r1 and r2 represent,

	 The preceding formulas, which are given by Loewenstein (Ref. 4), are directly 
applicable to steel, for which the values ν = 0.3 and δ = 0.28 lb/in3 have been 
assumed.
Two values of σr are known or can be assumed, viz. the values at the inner and outer 
perimeters of the disk. Then, by setting the tangential stress at the outer boundary of 
each ring equal to the tangential stress at the inner boundary of the adjacent larger ring, 
one equation in σr will be obtained for each common ring boundary. In this case, the 
modulus of elasticity is the same for adjacent rings and the radial stress σr at the bound-
ary is common to both rings, and so the tangential stresses can be equated instead of the 
tangential strains [Eq. (16.2-15) for the smaller ring equals Eq. (16.2-14) for the larger 
ring]. Therefore there are as many equations as there are unknown boundary radial 
stresses, and hence the radial stress at each boundary can be found. The tangential 
stresses can then be found by Eqs. (16.2-14) and (16.2-15), and then the stresses at any 

766	
C h a p t e r  S i x t e e n
point in a ring can be found by using, in Eq. (16.2-14), the known values of σr1 and σt1 and 
substituting for σr2 the unknown radial stress σr  , and for r2 the corresponding radius r.
A fact of importance with reference to turbine disks or other rotating bodies is that 
geometrically similar disks of different sizes will be equally stressed at corresponding 
points when running at the same peripheral velocity. Furthermore, for any given periph-
eral velocity, the axial and radial dimensions of a rotating body may be changed 
independently of each other and in any ratio without affecting the stresses at similarly 
situated points.
Example  The conical steel disk shown in section in Fig. 16.4 rotates at 2500 rpm. To its rim, it has 
attached buckets whose aggregate mass amounts to w = 0.75 lb/linear in of rim; this mass may be 
considered to be centered 30 in from the axis. It is desired to determine the stresses at a point 7 in 
from the axis.
Solution  From the dimensions of the section, R is found to be 28 in. The values of r/R for the inner and 
outer perimeters and for the circumference r = 7 are calculated, and the corresponding coefficients Kr  , 
Kt  , etc., are determined from the table on page 763 by graphic interpolation. The results are tabulated 
here for convenience:

Bursting Speed
The formulas given above for stresses in rotating disks presuppose elastic conditions; 
when the elastic limit is exceeded, plastic yielding tends to equalize the stress intensity 
along a diametral plane. Because of this, the average stress σa on such a plane is perhaps 
a better criterion of margin of safety against bursting than is the maximum stress com-
puted for elastic conditions. For a solid disk of uniform thickness (case 7),

Tests (Refs. 12 and 13) have shown that for some materials, rupture occurs in both 
solid and pierced disks when σa, computed for the original dimensions, becomes equal 
to the ultimate tensile strength of the material as determined by a conventional test. 
On the other hand, some materials fail at values of σa as low as 61.5% of the ultimate 
strength, and the lowest values have been observed in tests of solid disks. The ratio of 
σa at failure to the ultimate strength does not appear to be related in any consistent way 
to the ductility of the material; it seems probable that it depends on the form of the 
stress-strain diagram. In none of the tests reported did the weakening effect of a central 
hole prove to be nearly as great as the formulas for elastic stress would seem to indicate. 
16.3  Impact and Sudden Loading
When a force is suddenly applied to an elastic body (as by a blow), a wave of stress is 
propagated, which travels through the body with a velocity

(16.3-1)
where E is the modulus of elasticity of the material and d is the weight of the material 
per unit volume.
Bar with Free Ends
When one end of an unsupported uniform elastic bar is subjected to longitudinal impact 
from a rigid body moving with velocity v, a wave of compressive stress of intensity

is propagated. The intensity of stress is seen to be independent of the mass of the 
moving body, but the length of the stressed zone, or volume of material simultaneously 

768	
C h a p t e r  S i x t e e n
subjected to this stress, does depend on the mass of the moving body. If this mass is 
infinite (or very large compared with that of the bar), the wave of compression is 
reflected back from the free end of the bar as a wave of tension and returns to the struck 
end after a period t1 = 2L/Vs, where L is the length of the bar and the period t1 is the 
duration of contact between bar and body.
If the impinging body is very large compared with the bar (so that its mass may be 
considered infinite), the bar, after breaking contact, moves with a velocity 2v in the 
direction of the impact and is free of stress. If the mass of the impinging body is m times 
the mass of the bar, the average velocity of the bar after contact is broken is

waves to produce a maximum stress very nearly equal to

Sudden Loading
If a dead load is suddenly transferred to the free end of a bar, the other end being 
fixed, the resulting state of stress is characterized by waves, as in the case of impact. 
The space-average value of the pull exerted by the bar on the load is not half the 
maximum tension, as is usually assumed, but is somewhat greater than that, and 
therefore the maximum stress that results from sudden loading is somewhat less than 
twice that which results from static loading. Love (Ref. 6) shows that if m (the ratio of 
the mass of the load to that of the bar) is 1, sudden loading causes 1.63 times as much 
stress as static loading; for m = 2, the ratio is 1.68; for m = 4, it is 1.84; and it approaches 
2 as a limit as m increases. It can be seen that the ordinary assumption that sudden 
loading causes twice as much stress and deflection as static loading is always a safe 
one to make.

Moving Load on Beam
If a constant force moves at uniform speed across a beam with simply supported ends, the 
maximum deflection produced exceeds the static deflection that the same force would 
produce. If v represents the velocity of the force, l the span, and w the lowest natural vibra-
tion frequency of the (unloaded) beam, then theoretically the maximum value of the ratio 
of dynamic to static deflection is 1.74; it occurs for v = wl/1.64p and at the instant when 
the force has progressed at a distance 0:757l along the span (Refs. 15 and 16).
If a constant mass W moves across a simple beam of relatively negligible mass, then 
the maximum ratio of dynamic to static deflection is [

16.4  Impact and Sudden Loading; Approximate Formulas
If it is assumed that the stresses due to impact are distributed throughout any elastic 
body exactly as in the case of static loading, then it can be shown that the vertical defor-
mation di and stress σi produced in any such body (bar, beam, truss, etc.) by the vertical 
impact of a body falling from a height of h are greater than the deformation d and stress 
σ produced by the weight of the same body applied as a static load in the ratio

If h = 0, we have the case of sudden loading, and di/d = σi/σ = 2, as is usually assumed.

Energy Losses
The above approximate formulas are derived on the assumptions that impact strains 
the elastic body in the same way (though not in the same degree) as static loading and 
that all the kinetic energy of the moving body is expended in producing this strain. 
Actually, on impact, some kinetic energy is dissipated; and this loss, which can be found 
by equating the momentum of the entire system before and after impact, is most conve-
niently taken into account by multiplying the available energy (measured by h or by v2) 
by a factor K, the value of which is as follows for a number of simple cases involving 
members of uniform section:

16.5  Remarks on Stress Due to Impact
It is improbable that in any actual case of impact the stresses can be calculated accu-
rately by any of the methods or formulas given previously. Equation (16.3-3), for 
instance, is supposedly very nearly precise if the conditions assumed are realized, but 
those conditions—perfect elasticity of the bar, rigidity of the moving body, and simul-
taneous contact of the moving body with all points on the end of the rod—are obviously 
unattainable. On the one hand, the damping of the initial stress wave by elastic hyster-
esis in the bar and the diminution of the intensity of that stress wave by the cushioning 
effect of the actually nonrigid moving body would serve to make the actual maximum 
stress less than the theoretical value; on the other hand, uneven contact between the 
moving body and the bar would tend to make the stress conditions nonuniform across 
the section and would probably increase the maximum stress.
The formulas given in Sec. 16.4 are based upon an admittedly false assumption, viz. 
that the distribution of stress and strain under impact loading is the same as under 
static loading. It is known, for instance, that the elastic curve of a beam under impact is 
different from that under static loading. Such a difference exists in any case, but it is less 
marked for low than for high velocities of impact, and Eqs. (16.4-1) and (16.4-2) proba-
bly give reasonably accurate values for the deformation and stress (especially the defor-
mation) resulting from the impact of a relatively heavy body moving at low velocity. 
The lenitive effect of the inertia of the body struck and of attached bodies, as expressed 
by K, is greatest when the masses of these parts are large compared with that of the 
moving body. When this is the case, impact can be serious only if the velocity is 
relatively high, and under such circumstances the formulas probably give only a rough 
indication of the actual stresses and deformations to be expected. (See Ref. 18.)
16.6  Vibration
A very important type of dynamic loading occurs when an elastic body vibrates under 
the influence of a periodic load. This occurs whenever a rotating or reciprocating mass 
is unbalanced and also under certain conditions of fluid flow. The most serious situa-
tion arises when the impulse synchronizes (or nearly synchronizes) with the natural 
period of vibration, and it is of the utmost importance to guard against this condition of 
resonance (or near resonance). There is always some resistance to vibration, whether 
natural or introduced; this is called damping and tends to prevent vibrations of exces-
sive amplitude. In the absence of effective damping, the amplitude for near-resonance 
vibration will much exceed the deflection that would be produced by the same force 
under static conditions. Obviously, it is necessary to know at least approximately the 
natural period of vibration of a member in order to guard against resonance. Thomson 
and Dahleh (Ref. 19) describe in detail analytical and numerical techniques for deter-
mining resonant frequencies for systems with single and multiple degrees of freedom; 
they also describe methods and give numerous examples for torsional and lateral vibra-
tions of rods and beams. Huang (Ref. 22) has tabulated the first five resonant frequencies 
as well as deflections, slopes, bending moments, and shearing forces for each frequency 
at intervals of 0.02l for uniform beams; these are available for six combinations of 
boundary conditions. He has also included the first five resonant frequencies for all 
combinations of 7 different amounts of correction for rotary inertia and 10 different 
amounts of correction for lateral shear deflection; many mode shapes for these corrections 

772	
C h a p t e r  S i x t e e n
are also included. In Table 16.1, the resonant frequencies and nodal locations are listed 
for several boundary conditions with no corrections for rotary inertia or shear deflec-
tion (Corrections for rotary inertia and shear deflection have a relatively small effect on 
the fundamental frequency but a proportionally greater effect on the higher modes.). 
Leissa (Ref. 20) has compiled, compared, and in some cases extended most of the known 
work on the vibration of plates; where possible, mode shapes are given in addition to 
the many resonant frequencies. Table 16.1 lists only a very few simple cases. Similarly, 
Leissa (Ref. 21) has done an excellent job of reporting the known work on the vibration 
of shells. Since, in general, this work must involve three additional variables—the thick-
ness/radius ratio, length/radius ratio, and Poisson’s ratio—no results are included 
here. Blevins (Ref. 24) gives excellent coverage, by both formulas and tables, of reso-
nant frequencies and mode shapes for cables, straight and curved beams, rings, plates, 
and shells. A simple but close approximation for the fundamental frequency of a uni-
form thin plate of arbitrary shape having any combination of fixed, partially fixed, or 
simply supported boundaries is given by Jones in Ref. 23. The equation

2
.
max
p
δ
	
is based on his work where δmax is the maximum static deflection produced by the 
weight of the plate and any uniformly distributed mass attached to the plate and vibrat-
ing with it. It is based on the expression for the fundamental frequency of a clamped 
elliptical plate, but, as Jones points out with several examples of triangular, rectangular, 
and circular plates having various combinations of boundary conditions, it should hold 
equally well for all uniform plates having no free boundaries. In the 16 examples he 
presents, the maximum error in frequency is about 3%.
Fundamentals of Vibration
Vibration in general is a periodic or oscillatory motion of a mechanical system. 
Depending on the existence of an external load, vibration of a mechanical system can 
be free vibration or forced vibration, where in either case the system can be considered 
damped or undamped. The linear dynamic behavior of many engineering systems can 
be approximated with good accuracy by the “mass-damper-spring model” as shown in 
Fig. 16.5.

and time wise is out of phase with the excitation by the angle φ (ω). The variation of the 
amplitude ratio G(ω) and the phase angle with respect to the ratio of ω/ωn are plotted in 
Fig. 16.7, in which the following observations can be made.

3.	 The maximum value of the amplitude ratio is at ½ ζ(1 - ζ2)1/2.
	
4.	 For a small value of ζ, the system experiences large-amplitude vibration, a 
condition known as “resonance.” 
	
5.	 For a small value of ζ, the peaks of the amplitude ratio occur approximately 
at ω/ωn = 1 and have an approximate value of ½ζ. In such cases, the phase 
angle tends to 90°. 
	
6.	 For ω ω

n < 1, the displacement is in the same direction as the force, so that the 
phase angle is zero; the response is in phase with the excitation. For ω ω

Vibration Isolation
A supporting structure of a machine may experience excessive vibration if the excita-
tion frequency of the machine nearly coincides with the natural frequency of the struc-
ture. Therefore, the force transmitted to the base or foundation of a vibration system is 
of great interest, since it could cause damage to the supporting structure. 
 Let the magnitude of the harmonic excitation be F0 = kA; the measure of the force 
transmitted to the base is then

which represents a nondimensional ratio called transmissibility. Figure 16.8 reveals that 
for ω/ωn > 2 the transmissibility is less than one as ω/ωn increases. Therefore, to have 
an effective vibration isolator, the natural frequency of the system must be much smaller 
than the excitation frequency.
16.7  Temperature Stresses
Whenever the expansion or contraction that would normally result from the heating or 
cooling of a body is prevented, stresses are developed that are called thermal, or tem-
perature, stresses. It is convenient to distinguish between two different sets of circum-
stances under which thermal stresses occur: (1) The form of the body and the temperature 
conditions are such that there would be no stresses except for the constraint of external 
forces; in any such case, the stresses may be found by determining the shape and dimen-
sions the body would assume if unconstrained and then calculating the stresses pro-
duced by forcing it back to its original shape and dimensions (see Sec. 7.2, Example 2). 
(2) The form of the body and the temperature conditions are such that stresses are pro-
duced in the absence of external constraint solely because of the incompatibility of the 
natural expansions or contractions of the different parts of the body. 
A number of representative examples of each type of thermal stress will now be 
considered.* In all instances, the modulus of elasticity E and the coefficient of thermal 
expansion g are assumed to be constant for the temperature range involved, and the 
increment or difference in temperature ∆T is assumed to be positive; when ∆T is

negative, the stress produced is of the opposite kind. Also, it is assumed that the com-
pressive stresses produced do not produce buckling and that yielding does not occur; if 
either buckling or yielding is indicated by the stress levels found, then the solution 
must be modified by appropriate methods discussed in previous chapters. 
Stresses Due to External Constraint
	
1.	 A uniform straight bar is subjected to a temperature change ∆T throughout 
while held at the ends; the resulting unit stress is ∆TgE (compression). (For 
other conditions of end restraint see Table 8.2 cases 1q–12q.)
	
2.	 A uniform flat plate is subjected to a temperature change ∆T throughout while 
held at the edges; the resulting unit stress is ∆TgE/(1 - ν) (compression).
	
3.	 A solid body of any form is subjected to a temperature change ∆T throughout 
while held to the same form and volume; the resulting stress is ∆TgE/(1 - 2ν) 
(compression).
	
4.	 A uniform bar of rectangular section has one face at a uniform temperature T 
and the opposite face at a uniform temperature T + ∆T with the temperature 
gradient between these faces being linear. The bar would normally curve in the 
arc of the circle of radius d/∆Tg, where d is the distance between the hot and cold 
faces. If the ends are fixed, the bar will be held straight by end couples EI∆Tg/d 
and the maximum resulting bending stress will be ½∆TgE (compression on the 
hot face; tension on the cold face). (For many other conditions of end restraint 
and partial heating, see Table 8.1, cases 6a–6f; Table 8.2, cases 1r–12r; Table 8.5, 
case 7; Table 8.6, case 7; Table 8.8, cases 6a–6f; and Table 8.9 cases 6a–6f.) 
	
5.	 A flat plate of uniform thickness t and of any shape has one face at a uniform 
temperature T and the other face at a uniform temperature T + ∆T, the 
temperature gradient between the faces being linear. The plate would normally 
assume a spherical curvature with radius t/(∆Tg). If the edges are fixed, the 
plate will be held flat by uniform edge moments and the maximum resulting 
bending stress will be ½ ∆TgE/(1 - ν) (compression on the hot face; tension on 
the cold face). (For many other conditions of edge restraint and axisymmetric 
partial heating, see Table 11.2, cases 8a–8h; a more general treatment of the solid 
circular plate is given in Table 11.2, case 15.)
	
6.	 If the plate described in case 5 is circular, no stress is produced by supporting 
the edges in a direction normal to the plane of the plate.
	
7.	 If the plate described in case 5 has the shape of an equilateral triangle of 
altitude a (sides 2
3
a/
) and the edges are rigidly supported so as to be held in 
a plane, the supporting reactions will consist of a uniform load 1/8 ∆TgEt2/a 
per unit length along each edge against the hot face and a concentrated load

 at each corner against the cold face. The maximum resulting 
bending stress is ¾ ∆TgE at the corners (compression on the hot face; tension 
on the cold face). There are also high shear stresses near the corners (Ref. 8).
	
8.	 If the plate described in case 5 is square, no simple formula is available for the 
reactions necessary to hold the edges in their original plane. The maximum 
bending stress occurs near the edges, and its value approaches ½ ∆TgE. There 
are also high shear stresses near the corners (Ref. 8).

Stresses Due to Internal Constraint
	
9.	 Part or all of the surface of a solid body is suddenly subjected to a temperature 
change ∆T; a compressive stress ∆TgE/(1 - ν) is developed in the surface layer 
of the heated part (Ref. 7).
	 10.	 A thin circular disk at uniform temperature has the temperature changed ∆T 
throughout a comparati­vely small central circular portion of radius a. Within 
the heated part there are radial and tangential compressive stresses sr = st = 
½ ∆TgE. At points outside the heated part, a distance r from the center of the 
disk but still close to the central portion, the stresses are sr = ½ ∆TgEa2/r2 
(compression) and st = ½ ∆TgEa2/r2 (tension); at the edge of the heated portion, 
there is a maximum shear stress ½ ∆TgE (Ref. 7).
	 11.	 If the disk of case 10 is heated uniformly throughout a small central portion of 
elliptical instead of circular outline, the maximum stress is the tangential stress 
at the ends of the ellipse and is st = ∆TgE/[1 + (b/a)], where a is the major and b 
the minor semi-axis of the ellipse (Ref. 7).
	 12.	 If the disk of case 10 is heated symmetrically about its center and uniformly 
throughout its thickness so that the temperature is a function of the distance r 
from the center only, the radial and tangential stresses at any point a distance r1 
from the center are

	 where R is the radius of the disk and T is the temperature at any point a distance 
r from the center minus the temperature of the coldest part of the disk. [In the 
preceding expressions, the negative sign denotes compressive stress (Ref. 7).]
	 13.	 A rectangular plate or strip ABCD (Fig. 16.9) is heated along a transverse line 
FG uniformly throug­hout the thickness and across the width so that the 
temperature varies only along the length with x. At FG the temperature is T1; 
the minimum temperature in the plate is T0. At any point along the edges of the 
strip where the temperature is T, a tensile stress sx = Eg(T - T0) is developed; 
this stress has its maximum value at F and G, where it becomes Eg(T1 - T0). 
Halfway between F and G, a compressive stress sy of equal intensity is developed 
along line FG (Ref. 7).
	 14.	 The plate of case 13 is heated as described except that the lower face of the 
plate is cooler than the upper face, the maximum temperature there being

	 15.	 A long hollow cylinder with thin walls has the outer surface at the uniform 
temperature T and the inner surface at the uniform temperature T + ∆T. The 
temperature gradient through the thickness is linear. At points remote from the 
ends, the maximum circumferential stress is ½ ∆TgE/(1 - ν) (compression at the 
inner surface; tension at the outer surface) and the longitudinal stress is ½ ∆TgE/
(1 - ν) (compression at the inside; tension at the outside). (These formulas apply 
to a thin tube of any cross section.) At the ends, if these are free, the maximum 
tensile stress in a tube of circular section is about 25% greater than the value 
given by the formula (Ref. 7).
	 16.	 A hollow cylinder with thick walls of inner radius b and outer radius c has the 
outer surface at the uniform temperature T and the inner surface at the uniform 
temperature T + ∆T. After steady-state heat flow is established, the temperature 
decreases logarithmically with r and then the maximum stresses, which are 
circumferential and which occur at the inner and outer surfaces, are

	 where A is the coefficient of thermal diffusivity equal to the coefficient of thermal 
conductivity divided by the product of density of the material and its specific heat. 
(For steel, A may be taken as 0.027 in2/s at moderate temperatures.) [At the inner 
and outer surfaces, the longitudinal stresses are equal to the tangential stresses 
(Ref. 9).] The stated conditions in case 17 as well as those in cases 19 to 21 are 
difficult to create in a short time except for small parts heated or cooled in liquids.

	 18.	 A solid rod of circular section is heated or cooled symmetrically with respect to 
its axis, the condition being uniform along the length, so that the temperature 
is a function of r (the distance from the axis) only. The stresses are equal to those 
given by the formulas for case 12 divided by 1 - ν (Ref. 7).
	 19.	 If the solid rod of case 18 has the temperature of its convex surface raised at the 
uniform rate of m°/s, then, after a steady rate of temperature rise has been 
reached throughout, the radial, tangential, and longitudinal stresses at any 
point a distance r from the center are

Other problems involving thermal stress, the solutions of which cannot be expressed 
by simple formulas, are considered in the references cited above and in Refs. 3, 10, and 
25 to 29; charts for the solution of thermal stresses in tubes are given in Ref. 11. Deriva-

many other examples of bars, rings, plates, and cylindrical and spherical shells are

Chapter 17
Stress Concentration
W
hen a large stress gradient occurs in a small, localized area of a structure, the 
high stress is referred to as a stress concentration. Near changes in geometry of 
a loaded structure, the flow of stress is interfered with, causing high stress 
gradients where the maximum stress and strain may greatly exceed the average or nom-
inal values based on simple calculations. Contact stresses, as discussed in Chap. 14, 
also exhibit, near the point of contact, high stress gradients, which subside quickly as 
one moves away from the contact area. Thus, the two most common occurrences of 
stress concentrations are due to (1) discontinuities in continuum and (2) contact forces. 
Discontinuities in continuum include changes in geometry and material properties. 
This chapter is devoted to geometric changes.
Rapid geometry changes disrupt the smooth flow of stresses through the structure 
between load application areas. Plates in tension or bending with holes, notches, steps, 
etc., are simple examples involving direct normal stresses. Shafts in tension, bending, 
and torsion, with holes, notches, steps, keyways, etc., are simple examples involving 
direct and bending normal stresses and torsional shear stresses. More complicated 
geometries must be analyzed either by experimental or numerical techniques such as 
the finite element method. Other, less obvious, geometry changes include rough surface 
finishes and external and internal cracks.
Changes in material properties are discussed in Chap. 7 and demonstrated in an 
example where a change in modulus of elasticity drastically changed the stress distribu-
tion. Changes in material properties can occur both at macroscopic and microscopic levels 
which include alloy formulation, grain size and orientation, foreign materials, etc.
17.1  Static Stress and Strain Concentration Factors
Consider the plate shown in Fig. 17.1, loaded in tension by a force per unit area, σ. 
Although not drawn to scale, consider that the outer dimensions of the plate are infinite 
compared with the diameter of the hole, 2a. It can be shown, from linear elasticity, that 
the tangential stress throughout the plate is given by (see Ref. 60)

The maximum stress is σθ = 3σ at r = a and θ = ±90°. Figure 17.2 shows how the tangen-
tial stress varies along the x and y axes of the plate. For the top (and bottom) of the hole, 
we see the stress gradient is extremely large compared with the nominal stress, and 
hence the term stress concentration applies. Along the surface of the hole, the tangential 
stress is -σ at θ = 0° and 180°, and increases, as θ increases, to 3σ at θ = 90° and 270°.

The static stress concentration factor in the elastic range, Kt  , is defined as the ratio of 
the maximum stress, σmax  , to the nominal stress, σnom. That is,
	
Kt = σ
σ

nom
	
(17.1-2)
For the infinite plate containing a hole and loaded in tension, σnom = σ, σmax = 3σ, and 
thus Kt = 3.∗
The analysis of the plate in tension with a hole just given is for a very wide plate 
(infinite in the limit). As the width of the plate decreases, the maximum stress becomes 
less than three times the nominal stress at the zone containing the hole. Figure 17.3(a) 
shows a plate of thickness t = 0.125 in, width D = 1.50 in, with a hole of diameter 2r = 
0.50 in, and an applied uniform stress of σ0 = 320 psi.
A photoelastic† model is shown in Fig. 17.3(b). From a photoelastic analysis, the 
stresses at points a, b, and c are found to be

Table 17.1 provides the means to evaluate the static stress concentration factors in 
the elastic range for many cases that apply to fundamental forms of geometry and load-
ing conditions.
Neuber’s Formula for Nonlinear Material Behavior
If the load on a structure exceeds the value for which the maximum stress at a stress 
concentration equals the elastic limit of the material, the stress distribution changes 
from that within the elastic range. Neuber (Ref. 61) presented a formula which includes 
stress and strain. Defining an effective stress concentration factor, Kσ
σ
σ
=
max/
nom  , and 
an effective strain concentration factor, KE

geometric means of the stress and strain factors. That is, K

Kt and �nom are obtained exactly the same as when the max stress is within the elastic 
range. The determination of Enom is found from the material’s elastic stress–strain curve 
using the nominal stress.
Example  A circular shaft with a square shoulder and fillet is undergoing bending (case 17b of 
Table 17.1). A bending moment of 500 N-m is being transmitted at the fillet section. For the shaft, 
D = 50 mm, h = 9 mm, and r = 3 mm. The stress–strain data for the shaft material is tabulated 
below and plotted in Fig. 17.4. Determine the maximum stress in the shaft.

However, as one can see from the stress–strain plot that this exceeds the elastic limit of 200 MPa. Thus,

Since, based on Eq. (17.1-4), we are looking for the value of σmax εmax = 0.3826, we will interpolate σ ε 
between 0.378 and 0.46025. Thus,

This yields σmax = 252.6 MPa.
For dynamic problems where loading is cycling, the fatigue stress concentration factor is more 
appropriate to use. See Sec. 3.10 for a discussion of this.

17.2  Stress Concentration Reduction Methods
Intuitive methods such as the flow analogy are sometimes helpful to the analyst faced 
with the task of reducing stress concentrations. When dealing with a situation where it 
is necessary to reduce the cross section abruptly, the resulting stress concentration can 
often be minimized by a further reduction of material. This is contrary to the common 
advice “if it is not strong enough, make it bigger.” This can be explained by examining 
the flow analogy.
The governing field equations for ideal irrotational fluid flow are quite similar to 
those for stress. Thus, there exists an analogy between fluid flow lines, velocity, and 
pressure gradients on the one hand, and stress trajectories, magnitudes, and principal 
stresses on the other. The flow analogy for the plate in Fig. 17.3 is shown in Fig. 17.5(a), 
where stress-free surface boundaries are replaced by solid-channel boundaries for the 
fluid (wherever stress cannot exist, fluid flow cannot exist). The uniformly applied 
loads are replaced by a uniform fluid flow field. Along the entrance section A-A of 
Fig. 17.5(a), the flow is uniform, and, owing to symmetry, the flow is uniform at the 
exit of the channel. However, as the fluid particles approach section B-B, the stream-
lines need to adjust to move around the circular obstacle. In order to accomplish this, 
Figure 17.5  Stress–flow analogy.

S t r e s s  C o n c e n t r a t i o n 	
807
particles close to streamline 1 must make the greatest adjustment and must accelerate 
until they reach section B-B, where they reach maximum velocity, and then decelerate 
to their original uniform velocity some distance from B-B. Thus, the velocity at point 
c is the maximum. The compaction of the streamlines at c will lead to the development 
of a pressure gradient, which will actually cause the velocity of point b to be less than 
that of the incoming velocity of streamline 6 at A-A. Note also that when a particle on 
streamline 1 reaches point d, the particle theoretically takes on a velocity perpendicu-
lar to the net flow. This analogy agrees with that of the plate loaded in tension with a 
centrally located hole. The stress is a maximum at the edge of the hole corresponding 
to point c in Fig. 17.5(a). The stress in the plate corresponding to point b is lower than 
the applied stress, and for point d the stress in the plate is compressive perpendicular 
to the axial direction.
This analogy can be used to suggest improvements to reduce stress concentrations. 
For example, for the plate with the hole, the hole can be elongated to an ellipse as 
shown in Fig. 17.5(b), which will improve the flow transition into section B-B (note that 
this is a reduction of material). An ellipse, however, is not a practical solution, but it can 
effectively be approximated by drilling two smaller relief holes in line and in close 
proximity to the original hole as shown in Fig. 17.5(c). The material between the holes, 
provided the holes are close, will be a stagnation area where the flow (stresses) will be 
low. Consequently, the configuration acts much like that of an elliptical hole.
At first, this might not seem to make sense, since this is a reduction of more material—
and if one hole weakens the part, obviously more holes will make things worse. One must 
keep in mind that the first hole increased the stress in two ways: (1) by reducing the cross-
sectional area and (2) by changing the shape of the stress distribution. The two additional 
holes in Fig. 17.5(c) do not change the area reduction unless they are larger than the origi-
nal hole. However, as stated, the additional holes will improve the flow transition, and 
consequently reduce the stress concentration. Another way of improving the plate with 
the hole is to elongate the hole in the axial direction to a slot.
Figure 17.6  Stress concentration reductions. 

808	
C h a p t e r  S e v e n t e e n
Some other examples of situations where stress concentrations occur and possible 
methods of improvements are given in Fig. 17.6. Note that in each case, improvement is 
made by reducing material.
This is not a hard and fast rule, however, most reductions in high-stress concentra-
tions are made by removing material from adjacent low-stressed areas. This “draws” 
the high stresses away from the stress concentration area toward the low-stressed area, 
which decreases the stress in the high-stressed areas.

The elastic stress concentration factor Kt is the ratio of the maximum stress in the stress raiser to the nominal stress computed by the ordinary mechanics-of-materials formulas, 
using the dimensions of the net cross section unless defined otherwise in specific cases.
For those data presented in the form of equations, the equations have been developed to fit as closely as possible the many data points given in the literature referenced in each 
case. Over the majority of the ranges specified for the variables, the curves fit the data points with much less than a 5% error.
It is not possible to tabulate all the available values of stress concentration factors found in the literature, but the following list of topics and sources of data will be helpful. All the 
following references have extensive bibliographies.
Fatigue stress concentration factors (Kf); see the 4th edition of this book, Ref. 23.
Stress concentration factors for rupture (Kr); see the 4th edition of this book, Ref. 23.
Stress concentration factors pertaining to odd-shaped holes in plates, multiple holes arranged in various patterns, and reinforced holes under multiple loads; see Refs. 1 and 24.
Stress concentration around holes in pressure vessels; see Ref. 1.
For a discussion of the effect of stress concentration on the response of machine elements and structures, see Ref. 25.

A very close approximation to the maximum stress σA can be obtained by using the maximum stress 
for the given loading with the actual slot replaced by an ellipse having the same overall dimension 
normal to the loading direction, 2a, and the same end radius rA. See cases 9a, 10a, and 11a.

Chapter 18
Fatigue and Fracture
F
ailure due to fatigue and fracture is the primary threat to the integrity, safety, and 
performance of nearly all highly stressed mechanical structures and machineries. 
It can have major negative consequences, including serious injury or loss of life, 
severe environmental damage, and substantial economic loss. The fatigue failure occurs 
when a material is subjected to repeated loading and unloading that are above a certain 
threshold. For example, the elements of the structures in spacecraft, gas turbine, auto-
mobiles, pipelines and pressure vessels, and ships that are subjected to cyclic repeated 
loading are susceptible to fatigue and/or fracture failure. Upon localized fatigue failure 
of a material, a flaw or microscopic crack will initiate and grow to a critical size, and the 
structure will suddenly fracture. The shape of the structure will significantly affect the 
fatigue life.
In this chapter, the phenomenon of fatigue and the S-N curve are discussed. The 
discussion on fracture mechanics, including different modes of fracture and the stress 
intensity factors of different orientation and geometry of a crack, are then presented.
18.1  Fatigue in Materials
When machine elements or structural elements are subjected to time-varying loads, 
rather than static loads, they fail typically at stress levels significantly lower than the 
yield strengths of the materials. This phenomenon, which is called “fatigue failure,” 
was first recognized by Rankine who in 1843 published a paper entitled “On the Causes 
of Unexpected Breakage of Journal of Railway Axles” in which he hypothesized that the 
material had “crystallized” and become brittle due to the fluctuation stress. Fatigue 
failure of materials has become progressively more prevalent as technology has devel-
oped a greater amount of equipment, such as automobiles, aircraft, compressors, 
pumps, turbines, etc., which are subjected to repeated loading and vibration. Today it is 
often stated that fatigue accounts for a significant percent of all service failures due to 
mechanical causes.
Fatigue failures occur in many different loading conditions such as axial, bending, 
and torsion. When the temperature of the cyclically loaded component also fluctuates, 
thermo-mechanical fatigue is induced. The repeated application of loads in conjunction 
with sliding and rolling contact between materials produces sliding contact fatigue and 
rolling contact fatigue, respectively, while fretting fatigue occurs as a result of pulsating 
stresses along with oscillatory relative motion and frictional sliding between surfaces. 
At microscale, metals are not homogeneous and isotropic, rather they have discon-
tinuities at the grain boundaries that are induced in the manufacturing or fabrication 
process. When metals are subjected to cyclic load for a long time, local yielding occurs 

834	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t e e n
at a notch or other stress concentration areas. The material yielding causes distortion 
and creates a slip band along the crystal boundaries of the material. As the stress cycles 
increase, additional slip bands occur and coalesce into micro-cracks. Once a micro-crack 
is established, it creates further stress concentration larger than the original notch. 
18.2  Fatigue Testing
Fatigue characteristics of materials and stress states are generally determined through 
testing. In fatigue testing, a specimen is subjected to periodically varying constant ampli-
tude stresses. The applied stresses may alternate between equal positive and negative 
values, from zero to maximum positive or negative values. The most common loading is 
alternate tension and compression of equal numerical values obtained by rotating a 
smooth cylindrical specimen while under a bending load. The cyclic load is repeated 
until the material fails. A series of fatigue tests are made on a number of specimens of the 
material at different stress levels. The fatigue strength Sf (N) of each specimen, that is, the 
stress level that a material can endure for N cycles, is then plotted against the number of 
cycles. This stress-cycle diagram is called an S-N diagram. The S-N diagram is generally 
plotted as stress versus the logarithm of the number of cycles as shown in Fig. 18.1. For 
ferrous materials, the diagram shows a relatively sharp bend in the curve as the number 
of cycles increases. The stress level at which the material can withstand an infinite num-
ber of cycles is called the endurance limit. The endurance limit may be established for 
most steels between 2 and 10 (most common at 7) million cycles. That is, in most steels 
the endurance limit is observed as a horizontal line on the S-N curve. Nonferrous metals 
usually show no clearly defined fatigue limit. The fatigue strength of a part reduces if it 
has surface defects such as roughness or scratches and notches.

18.3  Fatigue and Crack Growth
As the material of a machine part is subjected to repeated loads, physical changes and 
deterioration of the material occur. As indicated in Sec. 18.1, during the cyclic loading 
small cracks or flaws are generated. These flaws are likely to appear on the surface of 
the part, i.e., fatigue failures generally originate at a surface (except for contact prob-
lems). Following nucleation of the crack, it grows during the crack-propagation stage. 
Eventually the crack becomes large enough and propagates through the material and 
the part fails. Depending on the material, the failure can be a ductile rupture or a brittle 
fracture. The rate of crack growth in the crack-propagation stage can be accurately 
quantified by fracture mechanics methods. The rate of crack growth per cycle can gen-
erally be expressed as

(18.3-1)
where a is the length of the crack, C and m are constants for a particular material, and ∆KI 
is the range of mode I stress intensity factor per cycle. Note that the various fracture 
modes, the stress intensity factor KI and its critical value KIC are discussed in Sec. 18.5. 
Using Eq. (18.3-1) it is possible to predict the number of cycles for the crack to grow to a 
size at which some other mode of failure can take over. Values of the constants C and m 
are determined from specimens of the same type as those used for determination of KIC 
(known as critical stress intensity factor) but are instrumental for accurate measurement 
of slow crack growth. The values of C and m are given in Table 18.1.
18.4  Fracture Mechanics
Almost all engineering materials used in machines and structures have imperfections 
such as infinitesimal flaws and cracks which reduce the load-carrying capacity of the 
structure. That is, materials sometimes fail by rapid fracture at a stress much below

their strength level as determined in static tests. These catastrophic and brittle failures 
originate at preexisting stress-concentrating flaws which may be inherent in a material. 
In fact, the term brittle fracture generally implies the separation of a component into two 
parts without excessive deformation.
The first successful analysis of a fracture problem is due to A. A. Griffith who in 
1920 (Ref. 1) postulated that an existing crack rapidly propagates when the strain energy 
released from the stressed body equals or exceeds that required to create the surfaces of 
the crack. After World War II, when some catastrophic failures such as bridges and 
pressure vessels were attributed to fracture failures, attention of researchers was drawn 
to growth of a crack. In the middle of 1950s, Griffith’s concept was considerably 
expanded by G. R. Irwin (Ref. 2), who showed that the energy approach is equivalent to 
a stress intensity factor (K) approach. That is, fracture occurs when a critical stress dis-
tribution ahead of the crack tip reaches a critical value of stress intensity factor Kc  , or in 
terms of energy as a critical value Gc (Kc and Gc are explained in Secs. 18.6 and 18.8, 
respectively), then the crack propagates. These values were shown to be material prop-
erties and provided the basis for development of the discipline of linear elastic fracture 
mechanics (LEFM).
In linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) the material is assumed to be isotropic 
and linear elastic. Based on the assumption, the stress field near the crack tip is calcu-
lated using the theory of elasticity. LEFM is valid only when the inelastic deformation 
at the crack tip is small compared to the size of the crack, what is so called “small-scale 
yielding.” If large zones of plastic deformation develop before the crack grows, elastic-
plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) must be used.
18.5  The Stress Intensity Factor
Consider an elliptical hole of major axis 2a and minor axis 2b in an infinite plane that 
is subjected to a uniaxial tensile stress σy = σ, as shown in Fig. 18.2. The maximum 
stress (stress concentration) occurs at (+/- a, 0) and is given by, σy = σ (1 + 2a/b). If b is 
decreased such that a >> b, then the elliptical hole becomes a crack of length 2a

(Fig. 18.3a). Utilizing the elastic solution, the tensile stress in x and y directions, and the 
shear stress in the x-y plane, at the tip of the crack, can be calculated as (Fig. 18.3b)

where σ is the uniaxial tensile stress in the y direction, and r and θ are the cylindrical 
polar coordinates of a point with respect to the crack tip. Note that σz is zero for plane 
stress and is equal to ν(σx + σy) for plane strain. Equation (18.5-1) reveals that as r 
approaches zero all the stresses approach infinity. That is, there is a singularity at the 
crack tip. Because of the singularity, the usual stress concentration approach is not valid.

Generally there are three modes of crack growth, namely, opening, sliding, and tearing, 
called modes I, II, and III, respectively. These modes describe different crack propagation 
and surface displacement, as shown in Fig. 18.4. The stress intensity factors associated 
with the three modes are KI  , KII  , and KIII. The geometry and loading of an infinite plane 
corresponding to the three modes are shown in Fig. 18.5. In a particular geometry and 
loading, a crack may propagate in a particular mode or in a combination of these modes.

18.6  Fracture Toughness
The stress intensity factor is a function of the applied load and the geometry of the 
crack. It has been shown experimentally that as the applied load is increased, at a criti-
cal value of stress intensity factor the crack starts to propagate. This critical value is 
known as fracture toughness and is designated by the symbol Kc. Fracture toughness is a 
material property and is measured experimentally based on an ASTM standard E399 
specimen, by either a beam or a tension member with an edge crack at the root of the 
notch. The critical stress intensity factors KIc’s for a few common engineering materials 
are listed in Table 18.2.
For some structural materials such as high-strength steels, titanium and aluminum, 
the fracture toughness slightly changes with the temperature. However, the resistance of 
steel to fracture decreases as the temperature decreases and as the loading rate increases.
The value of the stress intensity factor, K, is a function of the applied stress, the size 
and the position of the crack, as well as the geometry of the solid piece where the cracks 
are detected. Tables in Sec. 18.10 provides the stress intensity factors for different modes, 
geometry, and loading of materials. 
To avoid crack propagation, when designing for a safe crack length a or for the 
applied stress σ in a geometry, we must have
	
K < Kc	
Note that the crack size a, the magnitude of the stress σ, and the fracture toughness are 
primary factors in controlling the brittle fracture failure of a part. To have a nonpropa-
gating crack, the applied stress should create a stress intensity factor K which is less 
than the fracture toughness of the material. That is, the failure in a part occurs when the 
stress intensity factor reaches the value of the fracture toughness. Therefore, in design, 
the factor of safety for fracture mechanics is given by
	
n = Kc/K	
Example  Consider a semi-infinite plate made of aluminum and titanium alloy 2024, having an edge 
crack of length 15 mm. The plate is subjected to an in-plane tension σ0 , shown in Fig. 18.6. Estimate 
the maximum stress σ0 that can be applied without causing a sudden fracture in the plate; use the 
factor of safety of 2.5.

  From Table 18.2, the fracture toughness, KIc, of the material, Al-Ti 2024, is KIc = 31 MPa. Using the 
factor of safety of 2.5, the allowable fracture toughness is
KIc(allowable) = 31/2.5 = 12.4 MPa

18.7  Crack Tip Plasticity
The linear fracture mechanics method assumes no plastic region at the crack tip and 
thus there is a stress singularity at the tip of the crack. However, since structural materi-
als deform plastically above the yield stress, in reality, there will be a plastic zone sur-
rounding the crack tip. Tada, Paris, and Irwin (Ref. 3) considered a circular plastic zone 
with a diameter of rp to exist at the crack tip under tensile loading (Fig. 18.7). The radius 
of the plastic zone for plane stress is

In reality, experimental studies have shown that the plastic zone size and shape  
at the crack tip of a plate that is subjected to an in-plane tensile stress mode I varies 
through the thickness of the plate. Generally, depending on the thickness of the 
plate, there are two distinctive plastic zones—plane stress (zone 1) at the surface and 
plane strain (zone 2) in the middle of the plane, as shown in Fig. 18.8. In plane stress 
the size of the plastic zone is large and is in the order of the plate thickness. How-
ever, in plane strain, the size of the plastic zone (zone 1) is much smaller than the 
plate thickness and the second zone will dominate.
18.8  The Energy Balance Approach of Fracture
In linear fracture mechanics, in addition to the elastic stress field (stress intensity  
factor) approach, another method called energy balance approach is also used. Consider 
a crack of length 2a in an elastic plate with unit thickness (Fig. 18.3a). Then the total 
energy, U, of the elastic plate is
	
U = U0 + Ua + Uγ – F	
(18.8-1)
where U0 is the elastic energy of the loaded uncracked plate, Ua is the change in the 
elastic strain energy caused by introducing the crack in the plate, Uγ is the change in 
elastic surface energy caused by the formation of the crack surfaces, and F is work 
performed by external forces. 
Using the stress field in the vicinity of the crack and Hooke’s law, the opening 
(vertical displacement) of the crack at a point x can be written as 
	
d = (2σ/E)
a
x
2
2
-
	
(18.8-2)
Multiplying the opening d by σ and integrating it over the total crack length, the change 
in the elastic strain energy caused by introducing the crack in the plate is
	
Ua = (πσ2a2)/E           for plane stress, and	
	
Ua = (1 - ν2) (πσ2a2)/E    for plane strain	
(18.8-3)
Note that Eq. (18.8-3) was developed by Griffith, who used the Inglis stress analysis.

Consider now that the stress field σ is increased such that the crack starts to propagate 
(i.e., crack growth) Δa. The elastic energy of the plate is released as the crack growth con-
tinues. Therefore, for infinitesimal crack extension, the elastic energy release rate, G, is 
	
G = dU/da	
Using equations (18.8-3), the elastic energy release rate is
	
G = dU/da = (πσ2a)/E           for plane stress, and	
	
G = dU/da = (1 - ν2) (πσ2a)/E    for plane strain	
(18.8-4)
Using the mode I stress intensity factor KI, we have
	
G = KI
2/E           for plane stress, and	
	
G = (1 - ν2) KI
2/E    for plane strain	
(18.8-5)
Similarly, for a mode II fracture we have
	
GII = KII
2/E           for plane stress, and	
	
GII = (1 - ν2) KII
2/E    for plane strain	
(18.8-6)
Finally, the energy release rate for the case when all three modes of fracture are present is
	
G = [(KI
2 + KII
2) + (1 + ν)KIII
2]/E           for plane stress, and	
	
G = (1 - ν2) [(KI
2 + KII
2) + (1 + ν)KIII
2]/E    for plane strain	
(18.8-7)
The critical value of G is known as R, or the critical energy release rate. The fracture will 
be unstable and will start to propagate if
	
dG/da ≥ dR/da	
(18.8-8)
18.9  The J Integral
In the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics, where the plastic zone at the crack tip 
is relatively small, the quantities G and K are used. However, if the plastic zone at the 
crack tip is not negligible and must be considered, the J integral is used. Rice (Ref. 5) 
introduced a contour integral J taken about the crack tip as
	
J
U dy
t u
x ds
=
- ∂
∂




∫
0
Γ
	
(18.9-1)
where U0 is the strain energy density, x, y are the coordinate directions, t = n ⋅ σ is the 
traction vector, n is the normal to the curve Γ, σ is the Cauchy stress tensor, and u is the 
displacement vector, Fig. 18.9. Typical units for the J integral are MN/m (meganewton 
per meter). Note that the J integral is path independent, i.e., Γ could be any curve. Note also 
that if there is no crack, the J integral vanishes along any closed contour. For example, 
in Fig. 18.10, the J integral for the path of Γ = (Γ1 + AB + Γ2 + CD) is zero.

844	
C h a p t e r  E i g h t e e n
The critical value of J integral is denoted as Jc. Similar expression for the energy 
release rate is written for the J integral as
	
dJ/da ≥ dJc/da	
(18.9-2)
For mode I the J at initiation of crack propagation is given by ASTM standard E813. If 
there is a limited yielding (very small) at the crack tip then J and G are equal to
	
JI = GI = KI
2/E           for plane stress, and	
	
JI = GI = (1 - ν2) KI
2/E    for plane strain	
(18.9-3)
Similarly, for a mode II fracture we have
	
JII = GII = KII
2/E             for plane stress, and	
	
JII = GII = (1 - ν2) KII
2/E      for plane strain	
(18.9-4)
Finally, for the case when all three modes of fracture are present
	
JII = G = [(KI
2 + KII
2) + (1 + ν)KIII
2]/E            for plane stress, and	
	
JII = G = (1 - ν2) [(KI
2 + KII
2) + (1 + ν)KIII
2]/E    for plane strain

Following is a useful list of additional stress intensity factors for some simple crack 
geometries. For plane regions under in-plane loading conditions the results are valid 
for both plane stress and plane strain cases.* For more tables of stress intensity factors

Chapter 19
Stresses in Fasteners  
and Joints
T
wo or more separate structural elements are commonly connected using fasten-
ing elements such as welds, rivets, bolts, etc. In many fabricated structures, joints 
are often critically important in affecting the durability, reliability, and safety of 
the structure. It is important to design these joints such that no separation of the struc-
tural elements or failures of the fasteners occur. In this chapter, the analyses of welds, 
rivets, and bolts subjected to tension, bending, and shearing loads are presented.
In Secs. 19.5 and 19.6, reference is made only to rivets. However, the analyses pre-
sented apply to bolts as well.
19.1  Welding
Welding is a fabrication process where two or more pieces of base metal are joined 
through melting the workpieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten 
material. Welded connections represent a large group of fabricated metal workpieces. 
Unlike soldering and brazing, which involve melting a lower-melting-point material 
between the workpieces to form a bond between them, without melting the workpieces, 
welding is a complex process involving heat and liquid-metal transfer. There are many 
different welding processes. Examples include electric arc welding, spot welding 
(applying an electric current through the workpieces), gas flame welding, laser weld-
ing, electron-beam welding, ultrasonic welding, and friction or friction stir welding. 
These welding processes can be performed as manual, semi-automatic, and automatic 
processes. Robots can be designed to be used in industrial settings, and new welding 
methods are being developed to improve the quality and properties of the welded 
joints. While many welding applications are done in factories and repair shops, some 
welding processes are performed in underwater and in vacuums.
There are five types of configurations of joining (relative positions) two pieces; 
butt, tee, corner, lap, and edge, as shown in Fig. 19.1. While there are many forms and 
shapes of the welds, they fall into three categories: fillet welds, groove welds, and plug 
or slot welds. Fillet welds have a triangular cross section and are applied to the surface 
of the materials they join. Groove welds could be complete or partial, penetrating 
through the thickness of the workpieces. As shown in Fig. 19.2, they are in the form of 
square, bevel, V-groove, J-groove, and U-groove. In the plug or slot welds, the two 
pieces of materials are joined through one or more plug(s) or slot(s) that are prefabri-
cated in one of the parts.

Weld symbols are used to describe the types and forms of the weld. They generally 
have an arrow-shaped form where the symbols of Fig. 19.3 are used on the arrow to 
describe the type of weld. For further information see the standards provided by the 
American Welding Society (AWS). 
19.2  Analysis of Welded Joints
There are three dimensions associated with the welded joints: the throat h, the leg w, 
and the length of the weld, L. With exception of the length, these dimensions are shown 
in Fig. 19.4 for different types of welds. In fillet welds, the throat, h, is related to the leg, 
w, as h = w cos 45° or h = 0.707 w. In the following subsections, the stresses in welds 
under different loading are presented.

For a weld joint subjected to a shear force F that is not going through the center of the 
weld, the weld is subjected to torsion. In this case two shearing stresses, primary and 
secondary shear stresses, are produced. The primary shear stress due to the overall shear 
on the length of the weld that is uniformly distributed on the weld is

19.3  Strength of Welded Joints
There are many electrodes for various welding applications. The American Welding 
Society (AWS) provides specific codes for electrodes (see Table 19.1). The numbering 
starts with the letter E and is followed by four to five digits. The first two digits repre-
sent the approximate tensile strength of the weld. The last two or three digits refer to 
variables in the welding technique, such as current supply. For more information see 
the AWS specifications.
In groove welds where two parts of different thickness are to be welded, there is a 
partial joint penetration at the weld site. The minimum allowable sizes for fillet welds 
are given in Table 19.2. Generally, the minimum fillet weld size is governed by the 
thicker material; however, the minimum size of the weld should not exceed the thick-
ness of the thinner material unless it is required by the calculated stress.

*The American Welding Society (AWS) specification code numbering system for 
electrodes. This system uses an E prefixed to a four- or five-digit numbering 
system in which the first two or three digits designate the approximate tensile 
strength. The last digits include variables in the welding technique, such as 
current supply. The next-to-last digit indicates the welding position, as, for 
example, flat, or vertical, or overhead. The complete set of specifications may 
be obtained from the AWS upon request.

Table 19.2  Minimum Fillet Weld Size w
Table 19.1 reveals that for common structural materials, the weld material is often 
stronger than the welded materials. The allowable shear stress and unit load on fillet 
weld and the more common fillet sizes are given in Table 19.3. These values are for 
equal fillet welds where the effective throat h is equal to 0.707w. This table provides the 
allowable unit force per lineal inch of weld made with a particular electrode type. For 
example, the allowable unit force per lineal inch weld for a 7/8 in fillet weld made with 
an E80 electrode is
	
f = 0.707 wτ = 0.707 w (24.0) = 16.97 w = 16.97 (7/8) = 14.85 kips/lin in	
When a weld is treated as a line, the formulas are simplified and are shown in

19.4  Riveted and Bolted Joints
Rivets and bolts are used for connecting members. However, rivets are considered perma-
nent mechanical fasteners while bolts are removable. A rivet consists of a smooth cylindri-
cal shaft with a head on one end and is usually made from a soft grade of steel that does 
not become brittle when heated or hammered. After a rivet is placed inside a pre-drilled 
hole in connecting members, the opposite side of the head (known as a buck-tail) is 
hammered with a pneumatic riveting gun so that it expands to about 1.5 times the original 
shaft diameter of the rivet, holding the rivet in place, thereby joining the members. 
While bolts and screws are generally used for tension loads, rivets are more capable 
of supporting shear loads (loads perpendicular to the axis of the shaft). A typical single 
shear rivet joint is shown in Fig. 19.9. A double (two-sided) shear rivet connects three 
members, as shown in Fig. 19.10.

19.5  Shearing and Failure Modes in Riveted Joints
There are several modes of failure in riveted joints. In all the following cases, to ensure 
that no failure occurs, the calculated shear stress or the bearing stress should be less 
than that of the corresponding material strength with the consideration of the factor 
of safety. 
A. Shearing Mode of the Rivet
In this mode the rivet material is subjected to a shearing force across its cross section. 
The average shearing stress in the rivet τ is

(19.5-1)
where F is the shearing force, A is the cross section of the rivet (A = πd2/4), d is the 
diameter of the rivet, and n is the number of shearing surfaces. For a single rivet in 
double shear, n = 2. If there is more than one rivet in the connecting joints then n is the 
total number of shearing surfaces in the rivets. For example, for the case of Fig. 19.9,  
n = 1, and for the case of Fig. 19.10, n = 2.
B. Tension Mode of the Member
If h in Fig. 19.11 is sufficiently small the member may fail under tension. The tensile stress in 
the member with one rivet is

C. Tearing Mode of the Member
If the rivet is placed very close to the edge of the member, it could tear or shear the 
member, as shown in Fig. 19.12. The shearing stress of the member with one rivet is
	
τp

Lt
= 2
	
(19.5-3)
D. Compression or Bearing Mode of Members and Rivets
When the member material is softer than that of the rivet, or the rivet is located close to 
the edge of the member, then the rivet could crush the member (Fig. 19.13). In this case 
the compressive bearing stress of the member σbr is 
	
σbr
F
td
=
	
(19.5-4)
where t is the thickness of the member and d is the diameter of the rivet. On the other 
hand, if the material of the rivet is much softer than that of the member, then the rivet 
itself could fail and plastically deform under the bearing stress before it shears off. In 
this case the same formula Eq. (19.5-4) is used except that the σbr should be compared 
with the bearing stress of the rivet material. 
19.6  Eccentric Loading of Riveted Joints
In the previous section, Sec. 19.5, the resultant external force of the members passes 
through the centroid of the cross-sectional area of the rivet or the areas of a group of the 
rivets or fasteners, i.e., the rivets are concentrically loaded. However, a group of fasteners 
could be subjected to a system of load where the resultant of the forces does not pass 
through the centroid of the fasteners, i.e., the groups of the fasteners are eccentrically 
loaded. In concentrically loaded fasteners, the load is assumed to be uniformly distributed

among the fasteners. For an eccentrically loaded joint the force is replaced by an equal 
force at the centroid of the fasteners and a moment equal in magnitude to the force times 
its distance from the centroid. The shearing force due to the moment is resisted by each 
fastener according to its cross-sectional area and distance from the centroid of the fas-
tener group. The analysis in this section assumes that the cross-section areas of the rivets 
in the rivet group are equal. For unequal areas, see Example 7.8-1 of Ref. 4.
Consider a group of n rivets at a connecting joint where an eccentric load F is applied 
at a distance d from the centroid of the rivet group (Fig. 19.14). To calculate the stresses 
in each rivet in an eccentrically loaded rivet group, first the centroid of the group (X Y
, ) is 
calculated as

where Ai is the area of the i th rivet and n is the number of rivets. Then the force F is 
moved to the centroid and the primary shear stress that is equally distributed to all 
rivets is calculated as
	
Fp = F/n	
(19.6-2)
The secondary shear force Fs in each rivet that is due to the moment, M = F (d + L/2), 
satisfies the moment equilibrium as
	
M = Fs1r1 + Fs2r2 + Fs3r3 + …	
(19.6-3)
However, similar to a force on a lever arm, and assuming the areas of the rivets are 
equal, each rivet is subjected to a force directly proportional to its distance from the 
group centroid. Thus, the farthest rivet from the centroid takes the greatest force and 
the nearest rivet takes the smallest. This results in,

Chapter 20
Composite Materials
T
his chapter deals with the mechanical behavior of composite materials that are 
formed from two or more dissimilar materials, on a macroscopic scale, where 
each material is continuous and homogeneous. Common composite materials 
generally consist of stiff and strong fibers, such as glass, carbon, or aramid, embedded 
in a softer material, such as a thermosetting or thermoplastic polymer, known as the 
matrix material, or simply, the matrix. Because of their strength, the fibers carry the load 
while the matrix keeps the fibers aligned, transfer the load from fiber to fiber, and pro-
tect the fibers from direct mechanical contact. Composite materials are ideal for struc-
tures where high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios are necessary. For 
example, composite materials are used in aircraft and spacecraft due to their weight 
sensitive structures.
20.1  Composite Materials Classifications and Components
There are four classifications of composite materials with different characteristics. 
	
1.	 Fibrous composite materials, where long, strong, and stiff fibers, oriented in a 
specific direction, or woven fibers/fabrics are embedded in a softer matrix 
material, as shown in Fig. 20.1. 
	
2.	 Laminated composite materials, where layers of various homogeneous or 
composite materials are sandwiched and are bonded together, as shown in 
Fig. 20.2.
	
3.	 Particulate composite materials, where particles of different size and shape are 
embedded in a matrix material, as shown in Fig. 20.3.
	
4.	 Combinations of some or all of the first three types.
Fibers are characterized by their high length-to-diameter ratio and their near-crystal-
sized diameter. Because of these characteristics, long fibers are intrinsically stronger and 
stiffer than the same material in bulk form. Table 20.1 shows the density, strength, and stiff-
ness of a few selected fiber materials with respect to their density. On the other hand, short 
fibers, known as whiskers, are also used as particulates in composite materials which 
essentially have the same near-crystal-sized diameter as fibers. Generally, the length-to-
diameter ratio of the short fibers is in the order of hundreds. Short fibers have even higher 
mechanical properties than long fibers because they are manufactured by crystallization 
on a very small scale resulting in a nearly perfect alignment of crystals.
Matrix materials are usually polymers; however, metals, carbons, or ceramics are 
used in special composites. Major classes of structural polymers are thermoplastic,

fibers, or flakes
thermosets, and rubbers. A typical organic epoxy matrix material such as Narmco 2387 
has tensile strength of 4200 psi and modulus of elasticity of 0.49(106) psi. Metal matrices 
are generally made by pouring molten metal around an in-place fiber system by diffu-
sion bonding or by heating and vacuum infiltration. Ceramic matrices are generally 
casted or vapor deposited around in-place fiber systems. Table 20.2 describes the char-
acteristics of some common fiber and matrix materials used in a composite.
Laminated composite materials consist of at least two layers of different composite 
or homogeneous materials that are bonded together. For example, two or more sheets of 
composite materials each containing a fiber orientation system can be bonded together 
and form a laminated composite. Also, two or more sheets of base materials such as

glass, aluminum, plastic, or wood, etc., can be bonded together and form a new compos-
ite. If two different metals that usually have significantly different coefficients of thermal 
expansion are bonded together, they create what is known as a “bimaterial.” Cantilever 
forms of bimaterials are used in thermostats and temperature sensing devices.
When particles of one or more materials are suspended in a matrix of another mate-
rial, a composite material known as a particulate composite is formed. The particles or 
the matrix could be metallic or non-metallic. Examples of these composite materials are 
concrete where sand/gravel is mixed with cement as matrix and cermet where ceramic 
is used in a metal matrix as well as many others.
20.2  Mechanics of Composite Materials
Each material of a composite is generally uniform, or isotropic, in nature. However, due 
to the discontinuous nature of the composite, the material properties of the composite 
can vary with both position and direction and therefore are anisotropic. For example, 
an epoxy resin reinforced with continuous graphite fibers will have very high strength 
and stiffness properties in the direction of the fibers, but very low properties normal to 
or transverse to the fibers.
Fiber reinforced composite properties depend not only on the properties of each 
constituent, but also on the quantity of each constituent in the composite material. A 
key measure of the quantity of a constituent is the volume fraction of that constituent 
in a given volume of composite material. There are models for predicting the proper-
ties of a composite material based on the properties and volume fraction of each con-
stituent, in particular, the volume fraction of fibers and the volume fraction of matrix 
material. These models are referred to as micromechanical models where a layer of com-
posite material is assumed to exhibit combined effects of the composing materials 
that are uniformly distributed throughout the volume of the layer (lamina). This pro-
cess is also called homogenization where the mechanical properties of the matrix and 
the fiber lose their identities and a layer is treated as a single material with a single set 
of properties. 
In laminate composites where several layers are bonded together, each layer inter-
acts with the surrounding layers. The study of the individual layers in a laminate and 
how they interact is often referred to as macromechanics. 
20.3  Macromechanics of a Layer (Lamina)
In this section we address the “apparent” properties of a lamina which is large enough 
such that the details of the fibers and the constituent of the lamina are not dealt with. That 
is, a single layer unidirectional fiber reinforced composite material is often represented 
by idealized packing, as shown in Fig. 20.4. For this composite material, it is convenient 
to use an orthogonal coordinate system that has one axis aligned with the direction of 
the fiber reinforcement, known as the longitudinal axis; the transverse axis 2, that lies 
in the plane of the layer, perpendicular to the longitudinal axis; and a third axis 3 
through the thickness of the layer. Such a coordinate system is referred to as the principal 
material coordinate system (or often as the 1-2-3 coordinate system). In this case, the 1 
direction is the fiber direction, while the 2 and 3 directions are transverse directions, 
often referred to as the matrix directions. 

C o m p o s i t e  M a t e r i a l s 	
877
Unidirectional fiber reinforced composite materials have two orthogonal planes of 
material property symmetry, i.e., longitudinal and transverse (1 and 2) directions, that 
are mutually orthogonal to the third plane. Therefore, the stress-strain relations, the 
generalized Hooke’s law, in coordinates aligned with principal material directions are 
written in terms of the stiffness matrix, C, as

The form of the stress-strain relations in Eq. (20.3-1) defines orthotropic material 
behavior. Such behavior is characterized by: (1) a decoupling of shear and normal 
responses, resulting in many of the off-diagonal terms being zero; and (2) different 
material properties in the three mutually perpendicular directions. The stress-strain 
relations, in terms of the compliance matrix, S, are then given as

Therefore, there are only nine independent engineering properties that are needed to 
describe the elastic response of a layer of composite material.
Composite materials are usually in a layer or planar shape and are less often in a 
bulk form. Therefore, it may be assumed that the composite is in a state of plane stress. 
That is, a state where three of the stress components in a principal direction are so 
much smaller than the other stresses that they may be assumed to be equal to zero for 
subsequent stress analysis. As an example, consider a plate in which the thickness 
direction, which is aligned with the 3 direction, is much less than the in-plane dimen-
sions. The out-of-plane stress components s3 , t23 , and t13 will then be much smaller 
than the in-plane stress components s1 , s2 , and t12 and are taken to be identically zero. 
As a result, Eq. (20.3-3) can be reduced to:

Note that the plane-stress assumption can lead to inaccuracies at the free-edges of a 
layer where delamination of laminates is often initiated. It is important to remember

20.4  Micromechanics of a Layer (Lamina)
In this section the basic relationship of the composite material properties to the prop-
erties of its constituents is presented. The objective of the micromechanics approach 
is to determine the elastic moduli or stiffnesses of a composite material in terms of the 
elastic moduli of its constituent materials. The solutions of the micromechanics of 
composite materials can be obtained either by the mechanics of materials method or 
the theory of elasticity. The mechanics of material method, which is discussed here, 
employs simplified assumptions regarding the hypothesized behavior of the compos-
ite materials.
The basic starting point for the mechanics of materials model is the representative 
volume element shown in Fig. 20.6, where the elastic moduli of the fiber and the matrix 
in longitudinal 1-direction are E f
1  and Em
1  (superscripts f and m are for the fiber and 
matrix), respectively. Therefore, the fiber-direction modulus of the composite, E1 , can 
be developed by assuming that when a load is applied in the 1-direction, the strains in 
the fiber and matrix are the same. This iso-strain assumption leads to the result of

Equation (20.4-2) is often referred to as the rule-of-mixtures for apparent Young’s 
modulus of the composite material in the direction of the fibers. For a unidirectional 
fiber composite, the fiber and matrix volume fractions are reduced to

where Af is the area of fibers, Am is the area of matrix, and At is the total cross-sectional 
area of the composite. 
In an iso-strain model the estimated Poisson’s ratio of the composite material leads 
to the following expression,

where n12
f  is the fiber Poisson’s ratio and n12
m  is the Poisson’s ratio of the matrix. 
The apparent modulus of elasticity of the unidirectional fiber composite material 
in the transverse 2-direction (perpendicular to the fibers direction) is considered next. 
As shown in Fig. 20.6, unlike the 1-direction, the iso-strain assumption is not appro-
priate for estimating the apparent modulus E2 in 2-direction. However, it is reasonable 
to assume that when a transverse load is applied, the stress s2 is the same in the fiber 
and the matrix. This iso-stress assumption results in an estimate for E2 of the composite 
given by

The in-plane shear modulus of a lamina, G12 is determined using the mechanics of

matrix are not the same. The shear modulus of the composite material can be written as

20.5  Failure Criterion for a Layer (Lamina)
There are several failure criteria proposed to predict the failure of a unidirectional fiber 
composite material. These can be divided into two main groups, that of yield and a 
failure hypothesis.
	
1.	 Yield criterion  These criterions address the yielding and not the failure modes 
of composite materials. That is, these criterions propose a polynomial and 
tensorial criteria, using mathematical expressions to describe the failure surface 
as a function of the material strengths. Generally, these expressions are based 
on the process of adjusting (fitting) an expression to a curve obtained by 
experimental tests. The most general polynomial failure criterion for composite 
materials of this group is the Tensor Polynomial Criterion proposed by Tsai and 
Wu (Ref. 1). For brevity, the derivations of these criterions are not presented 
here and the readers are referred to the references at the end of this chapter.
	
a.	 Tsai-Hill Failure Criterion  Consider the unidirectional fiber composite 
lamina of Fig. 20.7 that is subjected to an off-axis loading of sx. The plane 
stresses s1 , s2 , and t12 (the stresses in the principal material directions) are

	 where X and Y are the strength of the composite material in the principal 
material 1 and 2 directions, and S is the shear strength in the 1-2 coordinates. 
Depending on the sign of the s1 and s2 , the strength in tension, Xt and Yt , or 
compression, Xc and Yc , must be used.

	 where Fi and Fij are strength tensors of the second and fourth rank tensor, 
respectively. Equation (20.5-2) is complicated, however; the simplified 
version of the equation for a unidirectional lamina (a layer) with fibers in the 
1-direction, similar to Eq. (20.5-1), can be written as

	 The Tsai-Wu failure criterion fits closer to the experimental results than the 
Tsai-Hill criterion; however, to determine F12 one needs to perform a rather 
difficult biaxial test of the composite material. 
	
2.	 Failure criteria associated with failure modes  These criteria consider 
different material strength failure modes of the constituents, i.e., the fiber and 
the matrix. These criteria have the advantage of being able to predict failure 
modes, such as fiber fracture, transverse matrix cracking, and shear matrix 
cracking.
	
a.	 Maximum stress criterion  This criterion considers that the composite mate­
rial fails when the stress exceeds the respective allowable stress of the 
constituents. That is, for tensile stresses,
	
s1 > Xt    and    s2 > Yt	
	
	 and for compressive stresses, 
	
s1 < Xc    and    s2 < Yc	
	
	 and for shear
	
t12 > S 	
(20.5-5)
	
	 There is no interaction between modes of failure in this criterion. That is, 
there are actually five sub-criteria and five failure mechanisms. 

C o m p o s i t e  M a t e r i a l s 	
885
	
b.	 Maximum strain criterion  This criterion considers that the composite fails 
when the strain exceeds the respective allowable strain of the constituents. 
That is, for tensile stresses,
	
e
e
1 > X t    and    e
e
2 > Y t	
	
	 and for compressive stresses, 
	
 e

	 and for shear
	
γ

(20.5-6)
	
	 where Xεt  , Xεc and Yεt  , Yεc are the allowable strains in the 1 and 2 directions, 
respectively (t for tension and c for compression), and Sε is the allowable 
shear strain.
	
c.	 Hashin-Rotem criterion  Unlike the maximum stress and strain criterion, 
the Hashin-Rotem (Ref. 15) criterion takes into account interactions between 
the stresses and strains acting on a lamina. It involves two failure mechanisms, 
one associated with fiber failure and the other with matrix failure, 
distinguishing between tension and compression modes. That is, for

d.	 Hashin Criterion  Hashin (Ref. 3) later proposed a failure criterion for fibrous 
composites under a three-dimensional state of stress. The method uses the 
effect of the shear stress in the tensile fiber failure mode. For the matrix failure 
mode, a quadratic approach is used since a linear criterion underestimates

would be too complicated. Therefore, the criterion states for

20.6  Macromechanics of a Laminate
A laminate consists of two or more laminae (layers) bonded together to create an integral 
structural element. An important part of the description of a laminate is the specification 
of its stacking sequence which is the fiber orientation of all the layers through the thick-
ness of a laminate. Figure 20.8 shows the exploded view of a laminate and the laminate 
coordinate system. The stacking sequence lists the layer fiber orientations relative to the 
+x axis of the laminate coordinate system, starting with the layer at the negative-most 
z-position. For example, for regular (equal thickness layers) laminates of Fig. 20.8 a list 
of the layers and their orientation with respect to the +x axis is sufficient and can be 
shown as [
]

T, where T signifies that the total laminate has been 
described. Note that only the angles of the principal material coordinates of each layer 
need to be given. When the thickness of the layers are not the same, a notation of layer 
thickness, t, must be appended to the previous notation. For example, [

indicates that the thickness of the second and third layers are twice and four times the first 
layer, respectively. When different materials and thicknesses are used in a laminate, then 
it is necessary to specify the material properties and thickness of each layer to completely 
describe a laminate.
For symmetric laminates with respect to the xy plane, the symbol S is used. For 
example, [

20.7  Classical Lamination Theory

. Since there can be many fiber 
orientations within a laminate, each orientation having its own principal material coordi-
nate system, it is more convenient to describe laminate behavior in terms of one coordinate 
system, namely the laminate, or xyz, coordinate system shown in Fig. 20.8. The stress-strain 
relations of Eq. (20.7-1) can be transformed to the laminate xyz coordinate system as

Note that in the Q matrix the shear stress is related to the two normal strains, and 
the two normal stresses are related to the shear strain. There are no zeros in the Q matrix 
as there are with the Q matrix. Therefore, the behavior represented by Eq. (20.7-5) is 
referred to as anisotropic behavior.

20.8  Macromechanics of a Laminate: Stress and Strain in a Laminate
In the analysis of laminates it is assumed that all the layers of a laminate are perfectly 
bonded and that the laminate is a thin plate and its deformation is small. It is also 
assumed that a normal to the middle surface of the laminate remains perpendicular to 
the middle surface. 
The Kirchhoff hypothesis is employed in which the strains ex , ey , and γ xy vary linearly 
through the thickness of the laminate. Following the geometry of the cross section 
shown in Fig. 20.9, the displacements in the x, y, and z directions of a point P at location 
x, y, z within the laminate are

The elements of the ABD matrices needs to be discussed. The terms of the A matrix 
involve only the layer thicknesses, i.e., z

 , the thickness of the kth layer, while 
terms of the B and D matrices involve layer thicknesses and locations. Physically, the 
terms of the A matrix are the in-plane stiffnesses of the laminate, or extensional stiff-
nesses. The terms of the D matrix are the bending stiffnesses, and the terms of the B 
matrix are unique to composite materials and are referred to as the bending-stretching 
stiffnesses. This nomenclature refers to the fact that through these terms, bending effects, 
namely, the curvatures, κx
o , κ y
o , and κxy
o  , are coupled to in-plane force resultants, Nx , Ny, 
and Nxy , and conversely, the in-plane strains, ex
o , ey
o , and γ xy
o  , are coupled to the bending 
moment resultants, Mx , My , and Mxy.
When a laminate has symmetrical layers (symmetric laminates) all elements of the B 
matrix are zero. A symmetric laminate is defined as follows: If for every layer at a spe-
cific location with a specific thickness, material properties, and fiber orientation located 
on one side of the geometric mid-plane, there is an identical layer at the mirror-image 
location on the other side of the geometric mid-plane, then the laminate is said to be 
symmetric. 
For so-called balanced laminates, A16 , A26 , and ˆNxy
T  (the thermal resultant shear force) 
are zero. A laminate is said to be balanced if every layer of a specific thickness, material 
properties, and fiber orientation, has an identical layer with the opposite fiber orienta-
tion somewhere within the laminate. Symmetric and balanced laminates are very com-
mon and the relations of Eq. (20.8-7) simplifies considerably to

(20.8-13)
Cross-ply laminates are laminates constructed of layers with fiber orientations of only 
0 or 90°. For such laminates, because Q16 and Q26 are zero for every layer, all the terms 
in Eq. (20.8-7) with subscripts 16 and 26 are zero. For a symmetric cross-ply laminate, 
the relations of Eq. (20.8-7) simplify similar to Eqs. (20.8-10) to (20.8-13). In a case where 
the temperature of a balanced laminate or cross-ply laminate changes, the Eqs. (20.8-10) to 
(20.8-13) can be modified as

Example 4  Consider a laminate having layers of [
]
±45 0 90
/ /
S. Each layer is a glass-fiber-reinforced 
polymer composite of Example 2 with thickness of 0.125 mm. Determine the A, B, and D matrices and 
the resultant normal force when the temperature change is -100°C.
Solution  Since the laminate is symmetric, the B matrix is zero. Because there is a -45° layer for each 
+45° layer, the laminate is balanced. Neither the 0° nor 90 layers contribute to any 16 terms or the 
unit effective thermal stress resultants.

20.9  Inversion of Stiffness Equation in a Laminate
For engineering applications of composite laminates, usually the force and moment 
resultants and temperature changes are known for a laminate. It may be of interest to 
compute the strains and stresses in individual layers or throughout the entire thickness 
of the laminate. Therefore, we invert the relations previously discussed in order to cal-
culate the strains and curvatures of the laminate. Rewriting Eq. (20.8-7) in a condensed

20.10  Example of Stresses and Strains in a Laminate
When a laminate is utilized as a structural element, its material properties, fiber orienta-
tion, and z-coordinates of each layer of the laminate are known. This information would 
lead to the calculation of the numerical values for the elements of the A, B, and D matri-
ces. Knowing the magnitude and direction of the applied loads and the dimensions of 
the element, the force and moment resultants can be determined. The strains and cur-
vatures of the reference surface of the laminate can be computed using the various 
inverse relations of the previous section, depending on the particular laminate. These 
calculations are best executed by programming a calculator or computer to deal with 
the many algebraic relations, where hand calculations may lead to some errors. In this 
section, several examples that demonstrate the methodology of the stress and strain 
calculations of a laminate are presented. 
Example 6  Consider a flat eight-layer [
]
±45 0 90
/ /
s quasi-isotropic laminate 0.1 by 0.4 m loaded by a 
0.7 N⋅m moment, as shown in Fig. 20.12. The temperature change of the laminate is -100°C. Use the 
material properties of Example 4 and determine the through-thickness distribution of the stresses 
in the principal material coordinate system of the laminate. 
Solution  The symmetric and balanced nature of the laminate, along with the fact that only a 
single moment is applied, simplifies the computations considerably. If it is assumed that the 
applied moment is uniformly distributed along the opposite edges, the resultant unit moment is 
given by
	
Mx = -
= -
⋅
0 7 0 1

.
.
/
N m/m  	
The values of My and Mxy are zero. There are no unit equivalent thermal moment resultants, and the 
unit equivalent thermal force resultants are given by Example 4 as

The results show that the largest tensile and compressive stresses in the principal mate-
rial coordinate system due to the applied moment occur in layers 3 and 6, respectively, 
not in the outer layers. This is very much unlike the standard linear stress distribution 
due to bending of a beam where the largest magnitudes occur at z
t
= ± /2. This charac-
teristic of layered materials is often overlooked.
20.11  Strength and Failure Analyses of Laminate
The failure criteria previously described (Sec. 20.3) deal with the failure of a lamina  
(a layer). Failure mechanisms in laminates are more complicated than those in a unidi-
rectional composite under in-plane loading. This is due to the fact that multiple modes 
of failure occur and because the strength of a composite material in tension is consider-
ably different than the strength in compression. A composite can fail due to excess stress 
in the fiber direction, and the strength in the fiber direction in tension is greater than the 
strength in compression. Alternatively, a composite material can fail because of excess 
stress perpendicular to the fibers. The strength perpendicular to the fibers in tension is 
considerably less than the strength in compression. And finally, a composite can fail 
due to excessive shear stress. The strength in shear is considerably less than the strength 
in tension in the fiber direction, although the strength in shear does not depend on the 
sign of the shear stress. These issues are further complicated by the fact that when the 
fibers are oriented at an angle relative to the loading direction, there is a stress compo-
nent in the fiber direction, a component perpendicular to the fiber direction, and a shear 
stress. There are a number of theories of failure of laminates; however, no one theory, or 
criterion, works perfectly for all materials in all situations.
 Damage accumulation is an important failure mode in laminated composites. 
New damage mechanisms, such as delamination, and complex interactions between 
intralaminar and interlaminar damage mechanisms may occur in a laminate. The 
effects of delamination are usually treated separately from intralaminar damage mech-
anisms, although recent work has taken into consideration all the damage mechanisms 
in the failure analysis of a skin-stiffener composite structure (Ref. 23). Experimental 
evidence (Ref. 24) has shown that the failure in a laminated composite is very often 
progressive in nature, occurring by a process of damage accumulation. Therefore, the 
progressive loss of lamina stiffness must be taken into account as a function of the type 
of damage predicted.
Delamination is one of the predominant forms of failure in laminated composites 
and is due to the lack of reinforcement in the thickness direction. Delamination as a 
result of impact or a manufacturing defect can cause significant reductions in the com-
pressive load-carrying capacity and bending stiffness of a structure. The analysis of 
delamination is commonly divided into the study of the initiation and the propagation 
of an already initiated area. Delamination initiation analysis is usually based on stresses 
and use of criteria such as the quadratic interaction of the interlaminar stresses in con-
junction with a characteristic distance (Ref. 30). This distance is a function of specimen 
geometry and material properties, and its determination always requires extensive test-
ing. Delamination propagation, on the other hand, is usually predicted using fracture 
mechanics.
The fracture mechanics approach have been successfully utilized to predict lami-
nates fracture failure. This type of approach has been successfully used to predict 

C o m p o s i t e  M a t e r i a l s

laminate failure in the presence of stress concentrations, and it can accurately simu-
late hole size effects in laminates (characterized by a strength decrease for larger hole 
sizes in laminates without finite width effects). Methods based on fracture mechan-
ics require more experimental information than the method previously described. 
However, since virtually all composite structures contain stress concentrations, e.g., 
joints, it is considered that methods based on fracture mechanics should also be 
investigated, for example see Whitney and Nuismer’s (Ref. 28) failure criterion for 
unloaded holes.
 A practical failure theory of laminates that is easy to implement is the maximum 
stress failure criterion explained in Sec. 20.5. To review the section, there are five pos-
sible modes of failure in the maximum stress failure criteria. Failures are due to: 
tension in the fiber direction, compression in the fiber direction, tension perpendicu-
lar to the fiber direction, compression perpendicular to the fiber direction, and matrix 
in shear. A known level of stress failure for each mode is required. Failure in tension 
in the fiber direction is a direct result of fibers fracturing or otherwise breaking. Fail-
ure in compression in the fiber direction is due to the kinking of the fibers, generally 
due to the lack of support of the matrix material surrounding the fibers and the 
development of shear, or kink, bands within the fiber. Either alone or in combina-
tion, failure in tension perpendicular to the fibers is due to failures of the fibers, the 
matrix material between the fibers, and/or the bond between the matrix material 
and the fibers. Failure in compression perpendicular to the fibers is generally due to 
crushing of the matrix material. Finally, shear can cause failures in the fibers, the 
matrix material between the fibers, and/or the bond between the matrix material 
and the fibers. 
The five sub-criteria and five failure mechanisms of this criterion are

The maximum stress failure criterion states that failure occurs if any of the five 
inequalities of (20.11-1) are satisfied.

s. Neglect the end cap effect. The change in temperature 
due to curing is -100°C. In what layer, or layers, does the first failure occur, and what is the mode 
of failure?
Solution  In Fig. 20.13, the net force in the y direction from p is 2pRDl, where Dl is the length in the x 
direction. This is balanced by the internal force 2NqDl yielding Nq = pR. In the x direction, the end cap 
force ppR2 is balanced by 2p NxR resulting in Nx = pR/2.

Due to the internal pressure, these are the only two non-zero stress resultants acting within the cylinder 
wall away from the end caps. There are no moment resultants. There are, of course, equivalent thermal 
force resultants from the temperature change of -100°C.

The results indicate that there are 10 positive values of pa , 10 negative values of pa , 
and 4 values of infinity. The infinite values come from the two shear equations for 
the 0° layers and the two shear equations for the 90° layers. From these multiple values 
of pa , the lowest level of internal pressure is pa = 0 704

is obtained from the solution of the second equation for the positive failure stress

 atmospheres, cracks paral-
lel to the fibers occur in the 0° layers. If matrix cracking is to be avoided, only pres­
sures below this level are allowed. With this pressure the failure mode is tensile. 
However, a negative pressure of magnitude 10.78 atmospheres is obtained from the 
solu­tion of the second equation for negative failure stress levels for the 0° layers, i.e.,

. This value is the negative value of pa with the lowest magni-

due to excessive compressive stress perpendicular to the fibers, assuming that the 
cylinder has not buckled due to the external pressure.

Solid Biomechanics
21.1  Introduction
Biomechanics is the study of mechanical laws and their application to living organisms, 
especially the human body. In short, biomechanics is the application of mechanics in 
biology and physiology. That is, utilizing laws of physics to study and to analyze the 
anatomical and functional aspects of living organisms. Solid biomechanics, however, 
specifically deals with the internal and external forces acting on the locomotor system 
of the human body and the effects produced by these forces. While the conception  
of biomechanics, in limited areas of medicine, started in the late nineteenth century, it 
was not until the late twentieth century that some researchers employed principles of 
mechanics to explain some phenomenon in human physiology.
Biomechanics has been involved in virtually every facet of modern medical science 
and technology. Biomechanics has helped in solving all kinds of clinical problems asso-
ciated with virtually all human organs from the cardiovascular system to prosthetic 
devices. Even the molecular biology field, which may seem far from biomechanics, uti-
lizes physics principles to understand the mechanics of the formation, design, function, 
and production of molecules. Orthopedics has profoundly relied on biomechanics 
research to treat patients with musculoskeletal problems. Orthopedic surgeons employ 
biomechanics as their clinical tools. Rehabilitation and healing are intimately related  
to the stress and strain in the tissues. Due to its economic impact, injury biomechanics 
in automotive accidents and other trauma is becoming more important to modern 
society.
Similar to an engineering approach, biomechanics problems are generally posed 
through the governing equation and fundamental laws of physics when the geometry, 
anatomy, and configuration of an organ are known. Physiological experiments includ-
ing animals (in vivo or in vitro) are needed to verify or to compare with the analytical/
numerical solutions. In this chapter, anatomy, material characteristics, and biomechan-
ics of several generic types of human tissues such as bone, muscles, ligaments, etc., will 
be discussed. Prostheses and biomaterials will then be discussed. The body spatial 
coordinate system, used and frequently referred to in this chapter, is three orthogonal 
planes, namely, the sagittal plane (a vertical plane passes through the anterior and 
posterior of the body), the transverse plane (a horizontal plane), and the frontal plane 
(a vertical plane that passes through the left and right sides).

21.2  Biomechanics of Bone
Bones are the main load-bearing tissue in the skeletal system, the purpose of which is to 
protect internal organs, to provide rigid links and muscle attachment sites, and to facil-
itate muscle action and body movement. There are 206 bones in the human body that 
are categorized into four groups according to their general shapes and functions: short 
bones, which provide gliding motion and serve as shock absorbers (e.g., carpals); flat 
bones, which provide protection for underlying organs (e.g., scapulae or shoulder 
blades); irregular bones, which have different shapes to fulfill specific functions in the 
body (e.g., vertebrae in the spine); and long bones, which provide movements for upper 
and lower extremities (Fig. 21.1).
After the enamel of the teeth, bone is the second hardest structure of the body. Bone 
is a highly vascular tissue with excellent remodeling capability. That is, it can repair 
itself, alter its properties, and change its geometry in response to changes in mechanical 
loading. For example, when bone is not subjected to mechanical loading, its density 
changes, or when it is subjected to new and repeated mechanical loads, its shape, archi-
tecture, and density change.

Bone is composed of inorganic and organic phases and water. Based on the weight, 
bone is approximately 60% inorganic, 30% organic, and 10% water. On a volume basis, 
bone is approximately 40% inorganic, 35% organic, and 25% water. The inorganic por-
tion of the bone, which is in the form of small ceramic crystalline-type minerals, con-
sists of calcium and phosphate, resembling synthetic hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2). 
The organic phase of the bone consists primarily of type I collagen (90% by weight), 
some other collagen type III and IV, and a variety of noncollagenous proteins. 
Bone Structure
Macroscopically, there are two types of bone, cortical or compact bone, and cancellous 
or trabecular bone. Cortical bone forms the outer shell or cortex of the bone and has a 
dense structure, while cancellous bone is within this shell and is composed of thin 
plates, or rods (known as trabeculae), in a mesh structure, as shown in the femoral bone 
of Fig. 21.2. The interstices between the trabeculae are filled with red marrow. The 
porosity of cortical bone ranges from 5 to 30% and cancellous (trabecular) bone ranges 
from 30 to 90%. Except for the joint surfaces, which are covered with articular cartilage, 
a dense fibrous membrane called the periosteum surrounds all bones.

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - O n e
Microscopically, the osteon or haversian system is the main structural unit of 
bone. At the center of each osteon is a small channel, called the haversian canal, which 
contains blood vessels and nerve fibers. The osteon itself consists of a concentric 
series of layers (lamellae) of mineralized matrix surrounding the central canal, similar 
to growth rings on a tree (Fig. 21.3). Along the boundaries of each layer, or lamella, are 
small cavities known as lacunae, each containing one bone cell, or osteocyte. Osteon is 
typically about 200 micrometers (µm) in diameter, which varies with age, and has a 
length of 1 to 3 mm. The lacunae of adjacent lamellae are connected by numerous small 
channels, or canaliculi, which ultimately reach the haversian canal. 
Mechanical Properties of Bone
A. The Cortical Bone
The elastic and strength properties of human cortical bone are anisotropic. In the diaphy-
sis of long bones, the cortical bone is both stronger and stiffer in the longitudinal direction 
than in radial or circumferential directions (Table 21.1). Cortical bones are also stronger in 
compression than in tension (see Table 21.1). The mechanical properties of human cortical 
bone change (decrease) as the age increases. While the modulus does not reduce much, if 
at all, the strength is reduced at a rate of about 2% per decade. 
As with all biological materials, bone is viscoelastic and nonlinear. It has been 
shown that cortical bone is moderately strain-rate dependent. That is, for over a six 
order of magnitude increase in strain rate, the modulus only changes by a factor of 2, 
and the strength by a factor of 3 (Fig. 21.4). The majority of physiological activities occur 
in the range of 0.01 to 1.0% strain per second where the changes in bone strength are 
negligible.
In some simple failure analyses of bone, cortical bone has been considered a simple 
isotropic materials and the von Mises criterion has been employed. This approach

is not capable of describing multiaxial failure of cortical bone. However, the Tsai-Wu 
criterion, see Sec. 20.5, commonly used for composite materials, has been applied to 
cortical bone using the transversely isotropic and orthotropic properties of bone.
B. Trabecular Bone
The modulus of elasticity and the strength of trabecular bone vary depending on the 
anatomic site, loading direction, loading mode, and age and health of the individual. In 
compression, the anisotropy of trabecular bone, both modulus and strength, decrease 
with age, falling approximately 10% per decade (Fig. 21.5). The trabecular bone is stron-
ger in compression and is weaker in shear. Both the modulus and strength of trabecular

bone depend heavily on the apparent density, yet they depend on the anatomic site. 
Note that the density of bone is the ratio of mass to volume of the actual bone tissue; 
however, the apparent density is defined as the ratio of the mass of the bone tissue to 
the bulk volume of the specimen, including the volume associated with the vascular 
channels. The density of the trabecular bone also decreases with age. The apparent 
density of cortical bone is about 1.85 g/cm3, which does not vary much with anatomic 
sites or species. However, the apparent density of trabecular bone is as low as 0.10 g/cm3 
for the spine (vertebra) (Kopperdahl and Keaveny, 1998), about 0.3 g/cm3 for the human 
tibia (Linde et. al., 1989), and up to 0.6 g/cm3 for the load-bearing portion of the proxi-
mal femur (Morgan and Keaveny, 2001).
Bone Remodeling
Bone, as a living tissue, has the ability to remodel, by altering its size, shape, architec-
ture, density, and structure, to accommodate the mechanical loadings placed on it. 
According to Wolff’s law, bone remodeling is a function of the magnitude and direction 
of the mechanical stresses that act on the bones (Wolff, 1892). In other words, Wolff’s 
law states that bone is laid down (deposition) where needed and is resorbed where not 
needed. Bone remodeling particularly occurs around implants and prostheses where 
the mechanical stresses to the bone have altered, Sadegh et al. (1993), Cowin and Sadegh 
(1992), and Luo, Cowin, and Sadegh (1995). As an example of bone remodeling, con-
sider a bone fracture repair process where an implant is firmly attached to the bone to 
stabilize the fracture site. After the fracture has healed, if the implant is not extracted, 
the strength and stiffness of the bone may be diminished. This is due to the fact that the 
material of implants is about 10 times stiffer than the bone and thus the majority of 
the loading will be carried out by the implant. This is called stress shielding where an 
implant may cause bone resorbtion.

21.3  Biomechanics of Articular Cartilage
Articular cartilage is a tough, dense, white connective elastic tissue, about 1 to 5 mm 
thick, that covers the ends of bones in joints and enables the bones to move smoothly 
over one another. Articular cartilage is an isolated tissue without blood vessels, lymph 
channels, and nerves, and yet it withstands the rigorous joint environment without 
failing during an average lifetime. However, when articular cartilage is damaged 
through an injury or a lifetime of use, it does not heal as rapidly or effectively as the 
other tissues in the body. Instead, the damage tends to spread, allowing the bones to rub 
directly against each other resulting in pain and reduced mobility. 
The primary function of articular cartilage is to distribute joint loads over a wide 
area, reducing the stress concentration on the joint. Its secondary function is to provide 
a contacting surface with minimal friction and wear. 
Chondrocytes are mature cartilage cells. They are sparsely distributed and account 
for less than 10% of the tissue’s volume. As shown in Fig. 21.6, condrocytes are arranged 
in three zones through the thickness of cartilage. The first zone is close to the articular 
surface where condrocytes’s long axes are parallel to the articular surface. In the 
second, middle zone, the condrocytes are round and randomly distributed. In the 
third deep zone the condrocytes are arranged in columnar fashion perpendicular to the 
articular surface.
The organic matrix of cartilage is composed of a dense network of fine collagen 
fibrils enmeshed in a concentrated solution of proteoglycans (PGs). The collagen con-
tent of cartilage tissue ranges from 10 to 30% by net weight and the PG content from 
3 to 10% by net weight; the remaining 60 to 87% is water, inorganic salts, and small 
amounts of other matrix proteins, glycoproteins, and lipids. 
Cartilage is predominantly loaded in compression and is biphasic (solid-fluid) viscoelas-
tic in nature. When cartilage is compressively loaded, the water within the proteoglycan 
matrix is extruded. The stiffness of cartilage is a function of its permeability, and the 
fluid pressure within the matrix supports approximately 20 times more load than the 
underlying material during physiological loading, Mankin et. al. 1994. Cartilage material 
properties are given in Table 21.2.

21.4  Biomechanics of Tendons and Ligaments
Tendons and ligaments, along with the joint capsule, surround, connect, and stabilize 
the joints of the skeletal system. Ligaments and joint capsules, which connect bone to 
other bones, provide stability to the joints, by guiding the joint motion, and prevent 
excessive joint motion. The function of the tendons is to attach muscle to bone and to 
transmit tensile loads from muscle to bone. Tendons and ligaments are sparsely vas-
cularized and are composed of a combination of collagen and elastin fibers arranged 
primarily in parallel along the axis of loading. They have relatively few fibroblast 
cells and abundant extracellular matrix. In general, the cellular material occupies 
about 20% of the total tissue volume, while the extracellular matrix accounts for the 
remaining 80%. About 70% of the matrix consists of water, and approximately 30% is 
solids. 
Both tendons and ligaments are passive tissues and do not have the ability to con-
tract like muscle tissue. However, they are extensible in tensile loading and will return to 
their original length after being stretched within their elastic limits. The straightened

fibers exhibit linear deformation under further tensile loading, resulting in the nonlinear 
load-deformation curve, shown in Fig. 21.7. Typical tensile properties of ligament  
and tendon are shown in Table 21.3. Tendons are generally stiffer than ligament due to 
the higher concentration of collagen. Tendons and ligaments are highly viscoelastic 
and strain rate dependent; that is, they can tear or rupture at lower extensions when 
loaded at high rates.
21.5  Biomechanics of Muscles
Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in the human body, accounting for 40 to 
45% of the total body weight. There are 430 skeletal muscles, found in pairs on the right 
and left sides of the body. There are three types of muscles: (1) cardiac muscles that 
compose the heart; (2) smooth or involuntary muscles, which line the hollow internal 
organs; and (3) skeletal or voluntary muscles, which are attached to the skeleton through 
the tendons and cause them to move. 
Muscles are molecular machines that convert chemical energy into a force (mechan-
ical energy). The structural unit of skeletal muscle is the fiber, a long cylindrical cell 
with hundreds of nuclei, ranging from about 10 to 100 microns in thickness and about 
1–30 cm in length. Individual muscle fibers are connected together by three levels of 
collagenous tissue: endomysium, which surrounds individual muscle fibers; perimy-
sium, which collects bundles of fibers into fascicles; and epimysium, which encloses the 
entire muscle belly (Fig. 21.8).
The tendons and the connective tissues in and around the muscle belly are visco- 
elastic structures that help determine the mechanical characteristics of whole muscle 
during contraction and passive extension. In simulating musculotendon actuation, 
Hill (1970) showed that the tendons represent a spring-like elastic component located 
in series with the contractile-element (CE). This element is in parallel with parallel-
elastic-element (PEE) and in series with series-elastic-element (SEE) (Fig. 21.9).
The mechanical response of muscle fibers is known as twitching. Some muscle 
fibers, with small mass, contract with a speed of only 10 msec, while others with larger

mass may take 100 msec or longer. During muscle contraction, a tension load is exerted 
on the bone to overcome the external load of the body. The muscle tension is generally 
applied at a distance from the center of rotation of a joint in order to create a moment 
(torque) on the involved joint. 
There are three types of muscle contraction. First, when muscles develop sufficient 
tension to overcome the resistance of the body segment, the muscles shorten and cause 
joint movement in the same direction as the net torque generated by the muscles. These 
contractions are called concentrics. Second, when muscle tension is developed but no 
change in muscle length occurs, the contraction is said to be isometric. In this case, due 
to the developed contraction, the diameter of the muscles is increased. Third, when a 
muscle cannot develop sufficient tension and the opposing joint torque exceeds that 
produced by the tension, the muscle progressively lengthens instead of shortening. In 
this case the muscle is said to contract eccentrically. Note that concentric and eccentric

contractions involve dynamic work, in which the muscle moves a joint or controls the 
movement. Whereas isometric contractions involve static work, in which the joint posi-
tion is maintained (Fig. 21.10).
21.6  Biomechanics of Joints
Anatomically, there are three types of joints: immovable joints such as sutures of the 
skull; slightly movable joints such as cartilaginous joints (discs) where applied forces are 
attenuated to the adjacent bones; and, finally, freely moveable (synovial) joints such as 
articular joints in upper and lower extremities. In the following sections the biomechan-
ics of articular joints in upper and lower extremities is discussed.
21.7  Biomechanics of the Knee
The human knee is the largest and one of the most complex joints in the body. The knee 
joint is situated between the body’s two longest bones, the femur and tibia, and bears 
tremendous loads. The fact that the knee joint provides the mobility required for loco-
motor activities makes it one of the highest weight-bearing joints of the body. Anatomi-
cally, the knee joint includes (a) two condylar articulations of the tibiofemoral, with a 
third articulation being the patellofemoral joint; (b) the medial and lateral menisci car-
tilaginous discs located between the tibial and femoral condyles; (c) the articular cap-
sule, which is a double-layered membrane that surrounds the joint; (d) the synovial 
fluid, which is clear, slightly yellow liquid that provides lubrication inside the articular 
capsule at the joint; and (e) the patella, also known as the knee cap (Fig. 21.11). In addi-
tion, there are several ligaments in the knee joint; the two important ones are the ante-
rior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) (Fig. 21.11).

Knee Kinematics
Motion of the knee joint takes place in all three planes. However, the range of motion is 
greatest in the sagittal plane. Motion in this plane is from full extension to full flexion of 
the knee, which is approximately 140 degrees. When the knee is fully extended, its rota-
tion is almost completely restricted by the interlocking of the femoral and tibial condyles. 
However, when the knee reaches about 90 degrees flexion, the external rotation ranges 
from zero to approximately 45 degrees. During flexion/extension, in addition to the roll-
ing contact between the femoral and tibial condyles, there is tangential gliding between 
the two condyles as well. Also, in flexion-extension motion, the patella glides inferiorly 
and superiorly against the distal end of the femur in the vertical direction. The anterior 
and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL and PCL) limit the forward and backward sliding 
of the femur on the tibial plateaus during knee flexion and extension, and also limit knee 
hyperextension. They both play an important role in the stability of the knee.
Knee Loads
In flexing the knee, the three hamstring muscles are the primary flexors acting on the 
knee. However, during extension, the quadricep muscles provide the primary force for 
the knee. During daily activities, the tibiofemoral joint is subjected to compression and 
shear forces. Specifically, during the stance phase of a gait, the compressive force at the 
tibiofemoral joint can exceed three times the body weight, or during stair climbing, the 
compressive force is approximately four times the body weight. Figure 21.12 shows  
the static load diagram of the knee during stair climbing. Figure 21.13 shows the joint 
reaction force for one gait cycle, in terms of the body weight transmitted through the tibial 
plateau during walking. During the gait cycle, the joint reaction force shifts from the 
medial to the lateral tibial plateau. In the stance phase, when the force reaches its peak 
value, the medial tibial plateau carries most of the load. In the swing phase, when the 
force is minimal, the load is carried by the lateral tibial plateau. The contact area of the 
medial tibial plateau is approximately 50% larger than that of the lateral tibial plateau.

C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - O n e
Although the tibial plateaus are the main load-bearing structures in the knee, the 
menisci provide force absorption and distribute loads at the tibiofemoral joint over a 
larger area. This reduces the magnitude of contact stress at the joint. The joint cartilages 
and the ligaments also contribute to load bearing. 
Biomechanically, the patella serves two important functions. First, it aids knee 
extension by producing anterior displacement of the quadricep tendons throughout the 
entire range of motion, thereby lengthening the lever arm of the muscle force. Second, 
it allows wider distribution of compressive stress on the femur by increasing the area of 
contact. During the normal walking gait, the compressive force at the patellofemoral 
joint is about half of the body weight. During stair climbing, it increases to over three 
times the body weight (3.2 w), as shown in Fig. 21.12.
21.8  Biomechanics of the Hip
The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint and is one of the largest and most stable joints 
(less likely to be dislocated) and with a great deal of mobility. Anatomically, the hip joint 
is composed of the head of the femur, which forms approximately two-thirds of a 
sphere, and the acetabulum of the pelvis, which is a socket (Fig. 21.14).
The acetabular surface and the head are covered with articular cartilages. The femur 
is a major weight-bearing bone and is the longest, largest, and strongest bone in the 
body. The femoral neck is its weakest component and is primarily composed of trabe-
cular bone. The hip-joint cartilage covers both articulating surfaces. Several large and 
strong ligaments provide the stability of the hip.
Hip Kinematics and Loads
The hip joint, due to its ball and socket nature, moves in all three planes. In the sagittal 
plane it flexes or extends. In the transverse plane it rotates internally and externally,

and in the frontal plane it has abduction and adduction motions. The maximum range 
of motion is in the sagittal plane where the range of flexion is from zero to approxi-
mately 140 degrees and the range of extension is from zero to 15 degrees. The range 
of abduction is from zero to 30 degrees, whereas that of adduction is from zero to  
25 degrees. Its external rotation ranges from zero to 90 degrees, and its internal rotation 
ranges from zero to 70 degrees when the hip is flexed.
In terms of loading during flexion, six muscles crossing the joint anteriorly are 
primarily responsible for the motion. However, during extension, the three ham-
string muscles and the gluteus provide the motion. These muscles are the knee 
flexors as well. The hip is a major weight-bearing joint. During upright standing 
on both feet, the body weight is evenly distributed to each of the hip joints. To cal-
culate the forces and torques in each joint or muscle of the body, the dimensions and 
length of each body segment are needed. The length between each joint of the 
human body varies with body build, sex, and racial origin. However, an average 
set of segment lengths expressed as a percentage of body height was prepared by 
Drillis and Contini (1966) and is shown in Fig. 21.15. To determine the mechanism

total body weight. The moment arising from the weight above the hip joint must be 
balanced by a moment occurring from the force of the abductor muscles, as shown in 
Fig. 21.17. A simple balance of moment with respect to the center of the femoral head 
reveals that the abductor muscle force is F = [(5/6) Wb]/c, where c is the radius of the 
ball (femoral head) and b is the distance between the center of the ball and the CG of 
mass of the body, without the right hip (minus the one leg). Substitution of the val-
ues b and c leads to the abductor muscle force, which is about two times the body 
weight. The reaction force of the hip joint during a single-leg stance is approximately 
three times the body weight. This magnitude varies as the position of the upper body 
changes. 
During dynamic activities, several investigators (Paul 1967, Andriacchi et al. 1980, 
and Bergmann et. al 1997 and 2001) have studied the loads on the hip joint. Figure 21.18 
shows the hip joint reaction force in units of body weight during a one-gait walking 
cycle). In both men and women, the largest peak of about seven times body weight is 
reached just before toe-off. An increase in gait velocity increases the magnitude of the 
hip-joint reaction force in both swing and stance phases.

21.9  Biomechanics of the Spine
The human spine is a complex and functionally significant structure of the human 
body. The principal function of the spine is to protect the spinal cord and transfer loads 
from the upper body, head, and trunk to the lower extremities. The spine is capable of 
motion in all three planes through its 24 vertebrae which are articulated by interverte-
bral discs. The discs and surrounding ligaments and muscles provide the spine stabil-
ity. The spinal column is structurally divided into four regions. Starting from superior 
to inferior, there are 7 cervical vertebrae (C1–C7), 12 thoracic vertebrae (T1–T12),  
5 lumbar vertebrae (L1–L5), and 5 fused sacral vertebrae (S1–S5) (Fig. 21.19).
The spine contains four normal curves. The thoracic and sacral curves, which are 
concave anteriorly, are present at birth and are referred to as the primary curves. The 
lumbar and cervical curves, which are concaved posteriorly, are developed from sup-
porting the body in an upright position when young children begin to sit up and stand. 
These curves are known as secondary spinal curves. 
21.10  Biomechanics of the Lumbar Spine
The vertebral bodies are designed to bear mainly compressive loads. Anatomically, the 
vertebral bodies of the lumbar region are thicker and wider than those in the thoracic 
and cervical regions. The intervertebral discs in adults account for approximately one-
fourth of the height of the spine. The intervertebral disc bears and distributes loads and 
restrains excessive motion. The intervertebral disc is composed of two functional struc-
tures: a thick outer ring composed of fibrous cartilage called annulus fibrosus, and a 
central gelatinous material known as the nucleus pulposus, or nucleus (Fig. 21.20). The 
annulus surrounds the nucleus pulposus. The annulus fibrosus, composed of fibrocar-
tilage, which is a crisscross arrangement of the coarse collagen fiber bundles within the 
fibrocartilage. This allows the annulus fibrosus to withstand the high bending and tor-
sional loads. The nucleus pulposus lies directly in the center of every disc except those

in the lumbar segment, where it has a slightly posterior position, as shown in Fig. 21.20c. 
The vertebral body comprises a thin outer cortical shell and the encompassed cancel-
lous or trabecular bone. For an adult of 45 years or younger, the cortical shell and the 
cancellous bone, with the ratio of 45:55, share the load transmitted through the verte-
bral body, 45 years or younger, Goal and Weinstein (Ref. 19). For subjects over 40 years, 
the cortical bone shell transmits about 65% of the total load exerted on the body, due to 
an increase in the porosity of the cancellous bone. Table 21.4 shows the mechanical 
properties of the cortical shell and the cancellous bone in the vertebral body. The 
mechanical properties of ligaments surrounding the vertebrae are given in Table 21.5.
Spine Kinematics
The ranges of motion of the individual motion-segments of the spine have been measured 
by investigators. The representative values of the relative amount of motion at different 
levels of the spine are presented in Fig. 21.21, White and Panjabi (Ref. 55). The range of 
flexion and extension is approximately 4 degrees in the upper thoracic motion segments, 
about 6 degrees in the middle thoracic region, and about 12 degrees in the two lower

thoracic segments. This range progressively increases in the lumbar motion segments, 
reaching a maximum of 20 degrees at the lumbosacral level. The range of motion is 
strongly age-dependent, decreasing by about 50% from youth to old age. The first 50–60 
degrees of spine flexion occurs in the lumbar spine, mainly in the lower motion segments. 
The thoracic spine contributes little to flexion of the total spine because of the oblique 
orientation of the facets. Significant axial rotation occurs at the thoracic and lumbosacral 
levels. 
Spinal Load
During daily activities, the disc is subjected to a combination of compression, bending, 
and torsional loads. While the facets appear to function as a guide for the relative move-
ment of adjacent vertebrae, they in fact carry about 30% of the total load when the spine 
is hyperextended, El-Bohy and King et al. (Ref. 16). The vertebral arches and interverte-
bral joints play an important role in resisting shear forces. The abdominal muscles and 
the vertebral portion of the psoas muscle initiate flexion. The weight of the upper body 
produces further flexion.
When standing, the center of gravity of the total body is anterior to the spinal col-
umn (passes through L5), which makes the postural muscles active. That is, the spine is 
under a constant forward bending moment. As the body continues to flex, the moment 
arm of the trunk, arm, head, and neck increases leading to an increase in tension in the 
back extensor muscles. Figure 21.22 illustrates the back muscle tension, with a lever

arm approximately 6 cm long countering the torque created by the weight of the body 
and the external load. When the body is flexed (forward inclination), the spine makes 
the disc bulge on the concave side of the spine and retracts on the convex side. That is, 
the disc protrudes anteriorly and is retracted posteriorly.
When in a standing position a disc is subjected to a compressive load. Compressive 
stress predominates in the inner portion of the disc, and the nucleus pulposus, whereas 
tensile stress predominates in the annulus fibrosus. While lifting an object, the increase 
in abdominal pressure contributes to the stiffness of the lumbar spine and thus helps in 
lifting. While in a sitting position, the loads on the lumbar spine are less if the back is 
supported, since part of the weight of the upper body is supported by the backrest. The 
trunk muscles involved in motion contribute to the stability of the spine and maintain-
ing the posture in an upright position. 
During slow walking, the increase in loads on the lumbar spine is relatively modest. 
However, the loads increase with an increase in walking speed. In his study, Cappozzo 
(Ref. 9) showed that the loads were maximal around toe-off and increased approximately 
linearly with walking speed. Figure 21.23 reveals the axial load on the L3-L4 motion 
segment in terms of body weight during walking at four speeds. The solid horizontal

21.11  Biomechanics of the Cervical Spine
The cervical spine consists of seven vertebrae. The first two vertebrae, C1 and C2, are 
atypical, each having a unique structure and role, and the rest of the vertebrae, C3–C7, 
have similar structures and functions to that of the thoracic and lumbar spines.
The first vertebra in the cervical spine is called the atlas, which has no vertebral 
body, and is composed of a ring within which an oval fossa articulates anteriorly with 
the dens of C2. The superior facets of C1, which form the base of the atlanto-occipital 
joint, bear the weight of the skull. The second vertebra is called axis and is composed of 
dens, superior facets, pedicle, and spinous process. The dens is an articular process that 
protrudes superiorly from the vertebral body and around which C1 rotates. This con-
figuration allows significant rotation of the head.
Each of the five typical cervical vertebrae, C3–C7, has a body that is elliptical with a 
transversely concave upper surface, two pedicles, two laminae, and a spinous process. The 
intervertebral disc, similar to the lumbar disc, consists of a central gelatinous mass known 
as the nucleus pulposus, surrounded by a tough outer covering, the annulus fibrosus.
Cervical Spine Kinematics
The cervical spine is the most mobile region of the spine. The range of motion of the 
cervical spine in flexion-extension is about 145 degrees, in axial rotation about 180 
degrees, and in lateral bending about 90 degrees. Specifically, motion at the atlanto- 
occipital articulation, between C1 and the skull, consists of 10–15 degrees of flexion-
extension and 8 degrees of lateral flexion, with no rotation. The skull rotation is 
transferred into motion at the C1-C2 articulation, the antlantoaxial joint. The C1-C2 
joint is the most mobile segment of the cervical spine, having up to 47 degrees of axial 
rotation, representing 50% of the axial rotation of the whole cervical spine. However, 
at this joint, about 10 degrees of flexion and extension takes place with minimal lat-
eral flexion, White and Panjabi (Ref. 55). Flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and axial 
rotation occur at the joints below C2. A total of +/- 45 degrees of axial rotation takes 
place in C3–C7. Note that the range of motions varies widely among individuals.
Stability of the cervical spine has been discussed extensively in White and Panjabi’s 
publications. Instability is defined as excessive relative movements of adjacent vertebrae 
where there is a need of a clinical procedure to return the vertebrae to their normal posi-
tions. They suggested that the adult cervical spine is unstable, or on the brink of instabil-
ity, when any of the following conditions is present: more than 3.5 mm of transverse 
(horizontal) relative displacement of two adjacent vertebrae, or more than 11 degrees 
difference in rotation from that of either adjacent vertebra. These cervical conditions 
need clinical attention to be corrected.
Cervical Spine Load
The distribution of loads throughout the vertebra is a complex issue, which has been 
studied by several investigators. The results of these studies indicate that the facets 

S o l i d  B i o m e c h a n i c s 	
943
bear a portion of the load (King et al., Ref. 69, Miller et al., Ref. 70). In particular, in 
extension, the facets take up to 33% of the total load, substantially reducing the load 
of the discs. Harms-Ringdahl (Ref. 24) calculated the bending moment generated 
around the axes of motion of the atlanto-occipital joint (Occ-C1) and at the C7-T1 
motion segments. Figure 21.24 shows the extension and flexion moments at these 
joints in a variety of head positions. During extreme flexion, the maximum bending 
moment in the neck occurs at the C7-T1 joint, while the moment at the Occ-C1 joint is 
relatively high. As the head moves to its natural position, the moment at the Occ-C1 
joint slightly decreases while the moment at C7-T1 significantly decreases so that both 
joints carry approximately an equal amount of load. As the head continues to rotate 
and approaches the extreme extension, the moment on the Occ-C1 is further reduced 
while that of C7-T1 increases in the negative direction.
The head and neck, a large mobile ball atop a column, are particularly vulnerable to 
dynamic injuries. Excessive loading and motion of the head can easily create stresses 
and bending moments that exceed the strength of the structure, which leads to sublux-
ation and the destabilization of the neck.
21.12  Biomechanics of the Shoulder
The shoulder, shown in Fig. 21.25, is the most complex joint in the human body. It con-
sists of four major separate articulations as described below.

2.	 The acromioclavicular joint is located at the acromion process of the scapula 
(shoulder blade) articulates with the distal end of the clavicles. 
	
3.	 The glenohumeral joint is located at the hemispherical head of the humerus 
articulates with the glenoid fossa of the scapula. This is a ball-and-socket joint 
configuration and is the most freely moving joint in the human body, enabling 
flexion, extension, hyperextension, abduction, adduction, horizontal abduction 
and adduction, and the medial and lateral rotation of the humerus. There are 
four major muscles on the posteriori, superior, and anterior sides of the joint; 
providing the joint movements, they are called rotator cuff muscles. The capsule 
of the joint is surrounded and is stabilized by several ligaments and the tendons 
of four muscles, as well as the biceps. Negative pressure within the capsule of 
the glenohumeral joint also helps to stabilize the joint.
	
4.	 The scapulothoracis joint is located where the anterior scapula is articulated 
with the thoracic wall.
Shoulder Loads
The ball and socket configuration of the glenohumeral joint provides mainly the rota-
tion of the shoulder; however, it includes some rolling and gliding motion as well. The

rotator cuff muscles are oriented such that their tendons and their muscle masses may 
push on the head of the humerus, thereby stabilizing the joint. 
When the arm is in 90 degrees of abduction (extended horizontally in the frontal 
plane), the deltoid muscle (superior of the shoulder joint) provides a tension of 
about half of the body weight. This can be calculated by a simple static equilibrium 
of the joint as shown in Fig. 21.26. When a small weight of about 0.025 times of the 
body weight is held in the hand, the muscle force is approximately equal to the 
body weight. In these cases the joint reaction force, which is equal and opposite to 
the muscle force, is as high as the body weight. Therefore, the glenohumeral joint is 
a major load-bearing joint. 
21.13  Biomechanics of the Elbow
At the elbow joint, three bones are joined, the humorous, ulna, and radial. The elbow 
joint consists of three articulations, the humeroulnar, humeroradial, and proximal radi-
oulnar. All of these articulations are enclosed in the same joint capsule, which is rein-
forced by the anterior and posterior radial collateral and ulnar collateral ligaments. The 
elbow joint allows two degrees of freedom in motion, flexio-extension and pronation-
supination (rotation of the radius around the ulna).
Elbow Loading
The elbow is not considered a weight-bearing joint; however, it is regularly subjected to 
large loads during our daily activities. The two simple diagrams in Fig. 21.27 show the 
muscle forces and joint reaction forces, which could be calculated by a simple static 
equilibrium. The research has shown that the compressive loads during activities such 
as dressing and eating could reach as high as 300 N (67 lb). When rising from a chair 
and the body is supported by the arms, the load could reach as high as 1700 N (382 lb). 
During push-up exercises the peak forces on the elbow could reach as high as 45% of 
the body weight.

21.14  Human Factors in Design
When interacting with machines and devices, the human musculoskeletal system often 
has to provide forces to power a product or actuate a controller. The designs of machines 
and devices are influenced by the human’s ability to supply the force and to interact with 
the machine. The interface between humans and machines requires that humans sense 
the state of the device and be able to control it. That is, a product must be comfortable for 
a person to use. Thus, products and devices must be designed with the human factors in 
mind. The geometric properties of humans, that is, their height, reach, seating require-
ments, the size of the holes they can fit through, and the forces that they can exert in 
specific directions with their body segments are called Anthropometric data. The armed 
forces in the Military Standard MIL-STD-1472 have collected the majority of these data. A 
sample of these data is shown in Fig. 21.28 and Table 21.6. In addition, occupational bio-
mechanics researchers have studied measures of the human ability to perform various 
activities. Figure 21.29 shows the average human strength for differing body positions. 
For example, in a standing position, the push and pull force of the hand in the position 
slightly lower than the torso region is higher than that of the hand position at the neck 
level. More detailed information is available in MIL-HDBK (Military Handbook) 759A 
and in books on occupational biomechanics. In addition, Figs. 21.15 and 21.16 show the 
dimensions and masses of body segments as a fraction of height H and body mass M.
21.15  Implants and Prostheses
Medical implants are artificial substitutes for body segments, joints, and tissues. They 
are inserted into the body for functional, cosmetic, or therapeutic purposes. Prostheses 
can be functional, as in the case of artificial arms and legs, or cosmetic. Implants and

prostheses are interchangeably used. There are a wide range of implants and prostheses 
for repair, fixation, and replacement of virtually all the body parts and tissues.
Hip Implants
The development of hip prostheses has been the most active area of joint replace-
ment research since total hip joint replacement (THR). This is among the most com-
mon orthopedic procedures. The hip joint is called a ball-and-socket joint because 
the spherical head of the femur moves inside the cup-shaped hollow socket (acetab-
ulum) of the pelvis. To duplicate this action, a total hip replacement implant has 
three parts: the stem, which fits into the femur and provides stability; the ball, which 
replaces the spherical head of the femur; and the cup, which replaces the worn-out 
hip socket, see Fig. 21.30. Depending on the manufacturer, there are many designs of 
hip implant parts based on age, weight, bone quality, activity level, and health of the 
recipient. The stem portions of most hip implants are made of titanium or cobalt/
chromium based alloys. They come in different shapes and degrees of roughness. 
Cobalt/chromium based alloys or ceramic materials (aluminum oxide or zirconium 
oxide) are used in making the ball portions, which are polished smooth to allow easy 
rotation within the prosthetic socket. The acetabular socket can be made of metal, 
with a liner made of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene, UHMWPE, or a com-
bination of polyethylene backed by metal. All together, these components weigh 
between 14 and 18 oz depending on the size needed. The chance of a hip replacement 
lasting 20 years is about 80%.

Implant Fixation
To hold the femoral and acetabular components in place, two methods—cemented and 
cementless (bone ingrowth or Osseointegration)—are used. The cement, which is an 
acrylic polymer called polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), is used for older patients. 
However, the cementless method is used for younger patients (under 50 years of age) 
who are active and have good bone quality. Cemented fixation relies on a stable inter-
face between the prosthesis and the cement and a solid mechanical bond between the 
cement and the bone.
Cementless implants, where the implant is directly attached to bone without the 
use of cement, were introduced in the 1980s. The surface topography of the implant is 
textured or has porous regions, and the implant is generally coated with hydroxyapa-
tite so that the new bone actually grows into the surface of the implant. In general, these 
designs are larger and longer than those used with cement. A surgeon’s accuracy in 
placing the implant plays an important role in the stability of the implant since the 
channel must match the shape of the implant precisely. The intimate contact between 
the component and bone is crucial to permit bone ingrowth. New bone growth cannot 
bridge gaps larger than 1 mm to 2 mm. Hybrid total hip joint replacement (THR), which 
was introduced in the early 1980s, has one component, usually the acetabular socket, 
inserted without cement, and the other component, usually the femoral stem, inserted 
with cement. A hybrid hip takes advantage of the excellent track record of cementless 
hip sockets and cemented stems.
Implant Lossening
Hip implants may loosen due to several factors: (1) Cracks (fatigue fractures) in the 
cement that occur over time can cause the prosthetic stem to loosen and become unsta-
ble. This is more often the case with patients who are very active or very heavy. (2) The 
action of the metal ball against the polyethylene cup of the acetabular component cre-
ates polyethylene wear debris. The microscopic debris particles are absorbed by cells 
around the joint and initiate an inflammatory response from the body, which tries to 
remove them. (3) Micromotion between the implant and the bone prevents bone 
ingrowth into the implant.
The hip implants could be made of two or three types of materials, namely, metal, 
ceramic, and polyethylene. The crucial part of the implant is the contact between the

ball and the acetabular liner. The ball could be made of metal or ceramic and the liner 
could be made of ceramic, metal, or polyethylene (UHMWPE). The metal and plastic 
implants wear at a rate of about 0.1 mm each year. Metal-on-metal implants wear at a 
rate of about 0.01 mm each year, about 10 times slower than metal and plastic. There are 
also concerns about the wear debris that is generated from the metal-on-metal implants. 
Ceramics are the most resistant to wear of all available hip replacement implants. How-
ever, due to its low fracture toughness, ceramic implants can break inside the body.
21.16  Knee Implants
The total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or replacement implants are more complex because 
of the articulation of three bones, the distal femur, proximal tibia, and patella (the knee-
cap), where the surfaces actually roll and glide as the knee bends. There are many knee 
implant designs available having the following major components (Fig. 21.31):
	
1.	 Femoral component: The metal femoral component curves around the distal 
end of the femur and has an interior groove so the kneecap can move up and 
down smoothly against the bone as the knee bends and straightens. In some 
designs a smaller piece may be used (unicompartmental knee replacement) to 
resurface just the medial or lateral part of the condyle. 
	
2.	 Tibial component: The tibial component is a flat metal platform.
	
3.	 Polyethylene cushion: The cushion may be part of the platform (fixed) or 
separate (mobile).
	
4.	 Patellar component: The patellar component is a dome-shaped piece of 
polyethylene that duplicates the shape of the kneecap anchored to a flat metal 
plate.

The metal parts of the implant are made of titanium or cobalt/chromium based 
alloys. The plastic parts are made of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHM-
WPE). Altogether, the components weigh between 15 and 20 oz, depending on the size 
selected. Due to its continuous sliding and rolling, knee implant wear is a major prob-
lem where microscopic particulate debris are generated. Similar to the hip implants, the 
knee implants may be “cemented,” “cementless,” or “hybrid,” depending on the type 
of fixation used to hold the implant in place.
21.17  Other Implants
The majority of orthopedic implants are made of metals. There is considerable mis-
match between the metal and bone properties, which leads to stress shielding and bone 
resorbtion. New composite implants or graded materials are being developed to closely 
match the bone properties, thereby reducing the risk of bone resorbtion. 
There are many other orthopedic implants and prostheses for virtually every joint 
in the body as well as plates and rods for bone repair and fracture fixations. In addition, 
there are many types of screws for different locations and variety of bones. For these 
topics the reader is referred to specialized orthopedic books and literature. Some of the 
implants are described below.
Dental Implants
Dental implants have been widely used in recent years. There are two categories of 
dental implants: endosteal implants, which enter the bone tissue; and subperiosteal 
systems, which contact the exterior bone surfaces (Lemons, 1988).
Heart Valves
Mechanical or tissue prosthetic heart valves are used to replace the natural heart valves 
(miteral, tricuspid, aortic, and pulmonic) when these no longer perform their normal 
function because of disease (Gidden et al., 1993). Mechanical valves are of two types, 
caged ball and tilting disk. The materials most widely used are silicone elastomer, 
cobalt-chrome-based alloys, titanium, and pyrolytic carbon. 
Stents
A stent is a device made of inert materials and designed to serve as a temporary or per-
manent internal scaffold to maintain or increase the lumen of a vessel. For further infor-
mation see Schatz (Ref. 53).
21.18  Biomaterials
By definition, a biomaterial is a biocompatible material suitable for inclusion, augmenta-
tion or replacement of the function of bodily tissues or organs. Biomaterials science is a 
multidisciplinary field that brings together researchers from diverse academic back-
grounds, such as bioengineering, chemistry, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, 
mechanical engineering, materials science, biology, microbiology, and medicine. Bioma-
terials can be synthetic or natural, solid, and sometimes liquid. Solid biomaterials  
can be metals, ceramics, polymers, glasses, carbons, and composite materials. Such mate-
rials are used as molded or machined parts, coatings, fibers, films, foams, and fabrics. 

S o l i d  B i o m e c h a n i c s 	
953
Biomaterials are generally integrated into medical devices and implants and are rarely 
used on their own.
Historically, in the early 1900s bone plates were successfully implanted to stabilize 
bone fractures and to accelerate their healing, and since the 1960s, blood vessel replace-
ment and artificial heart valves and joint replacements were used. Since then, with the 
advent of new materials and prostheses, the field of biomaterials has rapidly expanded 
and saved many lives.
Key factors in the design and use of biomaterials are biocompatibility, toxicology, 
biofunctionality, and, to a lesser extent, the availability of biomaterials. Except for their 
brittle characteristics, ceramic materials are ideal candidates as biomaterials. Most bio-
materials and medical devices perform satisfactorily, improving the quality of life for 
the recipient or saving lives; however, they have exhibited some failures. This is due to 
the fact that manufactured materials and devices have a failure rate. Other factors such 
as genetic differences, gender, body chemistries, living environment and physical activ-
ity, as well as a physician’s “talent” for implanting devices may contribute to the suc-
cess or failure of the biomaterials and the implants.
Biocompatibility
The understanding and measurement of biocompatibility of biomaterials is not fully 
developed. It has been accepted that no foreign material placed within a living body is 
completely compatible. Only those materials (natural tissues) manufactured by the body 
itself (autogenous) are compatible, and any other substance that is recognized as foreign 
initiates some type of reaction (host-tissue response). Natural material that is obtained 
from an individual and that will be implanted into the same person is called autograft. 
However, if the donor is a different individual, the material is called allograft.
Prostheses and Implant Materials
A wide range of materials are used in the design and manufacturing of prostheses and 
implants. These materials are grouped as metals, polyethylene, ceramics, bioresorb-
ables, bioactive, and bone cements, or a combination of them. All these materials must 
possess strength and biocompatibility to withstand the forces and stresses imposed in 
the patient’s body and to not be rejected by the body.
A. Metals
There are four types of biocompatible metals. (1) Cobalt-Chrome alloys where the base 
metals are cobalt (> 34%) and chrome (> 19%) mixed with smaller quantities of other 
metals, even nickel. (2) Titanium alloys where the base metal is titanium; used commer-
cially with (ca 4%) Alumina. (3) Stainless Steel alloys where the base metal is iron (> 58%), 
mixed with larger quantities of chrome and nickel and some other metals. (4) Porous 
tantalum or Spongy metal which is composed of microscopic trabecular-type structure 
similar to trabecular bone. Thus, its mechanical characteristics come very close to the 
mechanical characteristics of the spongious bone itself. It is thus used mainly in recon-
structive procedures where it replaces the lost bone and as the porous coating of 
implants that allow greater ingrowth of bone tissue.
B. Polyethylene
The most common form of polyethylene is ultra-high molecular-weight polyethylene 
(UHMWPE) that is used for bearing surfaces in total joint prostheses and articular 

954	
C h a p t e r  T w e n t y - O n e
joints. There is a growing body of evidence showing that wear particles worn off the 
surface of a UHMWPE component may cause a failure of the whole joint.
C. Ceramics
Ceramic materials used in prostheses are zirconium oxides. Such ceramics are the most 
chemically and biologically inert of all materials. They are also stiff, strong, and hard. 
The main disadvantage of medical ceramic materials is their low fracture toughness or 
fragility. When the stress acting on medical ceramic materials exceeds a certain limit, 
ceramic materials burst exploding into many splinters.
There are two kinds of ceramic materials that are used in implants, alumina ceramic 
and zirconia ceramic. Zirconia ceramic is one of the highest-strength ceramics suitable 
for medical use. It is two to three times stronger than alumina ceramic. Particularly, 
femoral balls that are made out of this material have a smaller diameter than those 
made out of alumina ceramic. The surface of the zirconia ball can be made smoother 
than that of alumina ceramic and the wear produced by the zirconia ball coupled with 
polyethylene cup is only half as large as the wear produced by an alumina ceramic ball 
in identical coupling. Recent studies demonstrate that zirconia ceramic ages in the 
body’s temperature and the surface of the zirconia ball’s surface roughens. In non-ce-
ment (cementless) or osseointegrating implants a coating material known as synthetic 
hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] or HA is utilized. The HA facilitates the bone ingrowth 
and interlocks of bone with implant.
D. Bioresorbable
Bioresorbables are the materials that, upon placement within the human body, start to 
dissolve (resorb) and slowly are replaced by advancing tissue (such as bone). Common 
examples of bioresorbable materials are tricalcium phosphate [Ca3(PO4)2] and polylactic– 
polyglycolic acid copolymers. Calcium oxide, calcium carbonate, and gypsum are other 
common materials that have been utilized during the last three decades.
E. Bioactive
Bioactives are the materials that, upon placement in the human body, interact with the 
surrounding bone and, in some cases, even soft tissue. This occurs through a time-
dependent kinetic modification of the surface, triggered by their implantation within 
the living bone. An ion-exchange reaction between the bioactive implant and surround-
ing body fluids results in the formation of a biologically active carbonate apatite 
layer on the implant. For example, coating an implant with synthetic hydroxyapatite 
[Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] triggers bone ingrowth.
F. Bone Cements
Bone cement is a filler that is used for fixation of the artificial joints to the bones. Con-
trary to general perception, bone cement is not a glue, rather it is grout that fills the 
space between the implant and the bone. Bone cement is a compound consisting of 90% 
of polymethylmetacrylate (PMM); the remaining 10% is mainly crystals of barium sul-
fate or zirconium oxide that make the resulting product radio-opaque. Bone cements 
are produced manually, moments before use, by mixing a white polymer powder of 
PMM (PolyMethylMetacrylate) with a monomer fluid. This mixture polymerizes to a 
hard and brittle substance within ten minutes. The mixing process could have an effect 
on the quality of the cement. Studies have demonstrated that the use of low viscosity 
cements in the surgery of total hip replacements produced more failures than the use of 
conventional doughy products.

955
The following subsections deal with issues associated with the tissue response to 
biomaterials and implants.
G. Bioinert
Any material placed in the human body that has minimal interaction with its surround-
ing tissue is called bioinert. For example, stainless steel, titanium, alumina, partially 
stabilised zirconia, and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) (to some 
degree) are bioinert. A fibrous capsule that might form around bioinert implants may 
compromise the biofunctionality of bioinert materials. In addition, the tissue remodel-
ing around the implant (bone ingrowth or architectural changes such as resorption or 
depositon of bone) may alter the functionality of the implant.
H. Toxicity
Toxicology in biomaterials has evolved into a sophisticated science that deals with the 
substances that migrate out of biomaterials. For example, for polymers, many low 
molecular weights have shown some level of physiologic activity and cell toxicity. It is 
reasonable to say that a biomaterial should not give off anything from its mass unless it 
is specifically designed to do so, for example, cancer drug delivery systems used to 
destroy specific cells.

ecause of their importance in connection with the analysis of bending and tor-
sion, certain relations for the second-area moments, commonly referred to as 
moments of inertia, are indicated in the following paragraphs. The equations given 
are in reference to Fig. A.1, and the notation is as follows:
A:  area of the section
X, Y:  rectangular axes in the plane of the section at arbitrary point O
x, y:  rectangular axes in the plane of the section parallel to X, Y, respectively with 
origin at the centroid, C, of the section
z:  polar axis through C
x′, y′:  rectangular axes in the plane of the section, with origin at C, inclined at a 
counterclockwise angle θ from x, y

Upon the determination of the two principal moments of inertia, I1 and I2 , two 
angles, 90º apart, can be solved for from the equation for θp. It may be obvious which 
angle corresponds to which principal moment of inertia. If not, one of the angles must 
be substituted into the equations Ix′ and Iy′ which will again yield the principal moments 
of inertia but also their orientation.
Note, if either one of the xy axes is an axis of symmetry, Ixy = 0, with Ix and Iy being 
the principal moments of inertia of the section.
If I
I

=
 for a set of principal axes through a point, it follows that the moments of 
inertia for all ′ ′
x y  axes through that point, in the same plane, are equal and Ix y
′ ′ = 0 
regardless of θ. Thus the moment of inertia of a square, an equilateral triangle, or any 
section having two or more axes of identical symmetry is the same for any central 
axis.
The moment of inertia and radius of gyration of a section with respect to a centroi-
dal axis are less than for any other axis parallel thereto.
The moment of inertia of a composite section (one regarded as made up of rectan-
gles, triangles, circular segments, etc.) about an axis is equal to the sum of the moments 
of inertia of each component part about that axis. Voids are taken into account by sub-
tracting the moment of inertia of the void area.

Expressions for the area, distances of centroids from edges, moments of inertia, and 
radii of gyration are given in Table A.1 for a number of representative sections. The 
moments of products of inertia for composite areas can be found by addition; the cen-
troids of composite areas can be found by using the relation that the statical moment 
about any line of the entire area is equal to the sum of the statical moments of its com-
ponent parts.
Although properties of structural sections—wide-flange beams, channels, angles, 
etc.—are given in structural handbooks, formulas are included in Table A.1 for similar 
sections. These are applicable to sections having a wider range of web and flange thick-
nesses than normally found in the rolled or extruded sections included in the hand-
books.
Plastic or ultimate strength design is discussed in Secs. 8.15 and 8.16, and the use of 
this technique requires the value of the fully plastic bending moment—the product of 
the yield strength of a ductile material and the plastic section modulus Z. The last 
column in Table A.1 gives for many of the sections the value or an expression for Z and 
the location of the neutral axis under fully plastic pure bending. This neutral axis does 
not, in general, pass through the centroid, but instead divides the section into equal 
areas in tension and compression.

968
Notation: A = area (length)2; y = distance to extreme fiber (length); I = moment of inertia (length4); r = radius of gyration (length); Z = plastic section 
modulus (length3); SF = shape factor. See Sec. 8.15 for applications of Z and SF.

• General equation is  Ax + By + C = 0
• Standard form of the equation is  y = mx + b, slope intercept form
• Point-slope form is  y – y1 = m(x – x1) slope, m = (y2– y1)/(x2– x1)
• Angle between lines with slopes m1 and m2 is α = arctan [(m2 – m1)/(1 + m2·m1)]
• m1 = –1/m2 condition for perpendicular lines
• Distance between two points is  d

Conic Section
The general form of the conic section equation is
Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0
where not both A and C are zero.
If B2 – 4AC < 0, an ellipse is defined.
If B2 – 4AC > 0, a hyperbola is defined.
If B2 – 4AC = 0, the conic is a parabola.
If A = C and B = 0, a circle is defined.
If A = B = C = 0, a straight line is defined.

Matrix Addition and Subtraction
Two matrices A and B can be added or subtracted if and only if their dimensions are 
the same (i.e., both matrices have the identical amount of rows and columns). For 
example:
 A
B
= 



and
 
Addition
If A and B above are matrices of the same type then the sum is found by adding the cor-
responding elements aij + bij .
Example:

Transpose of Matrices
The transpose of a matrix is found by exchanging rows for columns, i.e., matrix A = (aij ) 
and the transpose of A is: 
AT = (aji) where j is the column number and i is the row number of matrix A.
For example, the transpose of a matrix would be:
A

The Determinant of a Matrix
Determinants play an important role in finding the inverse of a matrix and also in solving 
systems of linear equations. In the following we assume we have a square matrix (m = n). 
The determinant of a matrix A will be denoted by det(A) or |A|. Firstly the determinant 
of a 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 matrix will be introduced, then the n ×  n case will be shown.

The Inverse of a Matrix
Assuming we have a square matrix A, which is non-singular (i.e., det(A) does not equal 
to zero), then there exists an n × n matrix A–1 which is called the inverse of A, such that 
this property holds:
AA–1 = A–1A = I 
where I is the identity matrix.

The inverse of a general n × n matrix A can be found by using the following equation:
A
adj A
A
- =

det( )
where the adj(A) denotes the adjoint (or adjugate) of a matrix. It can be calculated by the 
following method:
•	 Given the n × n matrix A, define B
bij
= (
) to be the matrix whose coefficients are 
found by taking the determinant of the (n – 1) × (n – 1) matrix obtained by 
deleting the ith row and jth column of A. The terms of B (i.e., B = bij) are known as 
the cofactors of A.
•	 And define the matrix C, where 
c
b
ij
i j
ij
= -
+
(

•	 The transpose of C (i.e., CT) is called the adjoint of matrix A.
Lastly, to find the inverse of A divide the matrix CT by the determinant of A to give 
its inverse.

A simplified way of writing the above is like this: Ax = b
After looking at this we will now look at two methods used to solve matrices:
•	 Inverse matrix method
•	 Cramer’s rule
Inverse Matrix Method
The inverse matrix method uses the inverse of a matrix to help solve a system of equa-
tions, such as the above  Ax =  b. Pre-multiplying both sides of this equation by A–1  
gives
A
Ax
A b
A A x
A b
-
-
-
-
=
=
1
1

(
)
(
)
or alternatively this gives
x
A b
=
-1
So by calculating the inverse of the matrix and multiplying this by the vector b we 
can find the solution to the system of equations directly. And from earlier we found that 
the inverse is given by
A
adj A
A
- =
1
( )
det( )
From the above, it is clear that the existence of a solution depends on the value of 
the determinant of A. There are three cases:
	
1.	 If the det(A) does not equal zero then solutions exist using x
A b
=
-1 .
	
2.	 If the det(A) is zero and b = 0 then the solution will neither be unique nor 
exist.
	
3.	 If the det(A) is zero and b = 0 then the solution can be x = 0, but as in point above 
(2) it will neither be unique nor will it exist.
Looking at two equations we might have that

tions. We will illustrate this for solving two simultaneous equations in x and y and three 
equations with three unknowns x, y, and z.

Eigen Values
Given a linear transformation A, a non-zero vector x is defined to be an eigenvector of the 
transformation if it satisfies the eigenvalue equation, defined as
Ax = λx
for some scalar λ. In this situation, the scalar λ is called an eigenvalue of A corresponding 
to the eigenvector x.

Computation of Eigenvalues, and the Characteristic Equation
When a transformation is represented by a square matrix A, the eigenvalue equation 
can be expressed as A
I
x

-
=
λ
.
This can be rearranged to
(
)
A
I
-
=
λ
x
0
If there exists an inverse
(
)
A
I
-
-
λ
1
then both sides can be left-multiplied by the inverse to obtain the trivial solution: x = 0. 
For a non-trivial solution, the determinant must be equal to zero:
det(A − λI) = 0
The determinant requirement is called the characteristic equation of A, and the left-hand 
side is called the characteristic polynomial. When expanded, this gives a polynomial 
equation for λ.

Glossary
T
he deﬁnitions given here apply to the terminology used throughout this book. 
Some of the terms may be deﬁned differently by other authors; when this is the 
case, alternative terminology is noted. When two or more terms with identical or 
similar meaning are in general acceptance, they are given in the order of preference of 
the current writers. 
Allowable stress (working stress)  If a member is so designed that the maximum stress as 
calculated for the expected conditions of service is less than some limiting value, the member 
will have a proper margin of security against damage or failure. This limiting value is the 
allowable stress subject to the material and condition of service in question. The allowable 
stress is made less than the damaging stress because of uncertainty as to the conditions of 
service, nonuniformity of material, and inaccuracy of the stress analysis (see Ref. 1). The 
margin between the allowable stress and the damaging stress may be reduced in proportion 
to the certainty with which the conditions of the service are known, the intrinsic reliability of 
the material, the accuracy with which the stress produced by the loading can be calculated, 
and the degree to which failure is unattended by danger or loss. (Compare with Damaging 
stress; Factor of safety; Margin of safety. See Refs. 1–3.) 
Apparent elastic limit (useful limit point)  The stress at which the rate of change of strain with 
respect to stress is 50% greater than at zero stress. It is more deﬁnitely determinable from 
the stress–strain diagram than is the proportional limit, and is useful for comparing 
materials of the same general class. (Compare with Elastic limit; Proportional limit; Yield point, 
Yield strength.) 
Apparent stress  The stress corresponding to a given unit strain on the assumption of uniaxial 
elastic stress. It is calculated by multi­plying the unit strain by the modulus of elasticity, and 
may differ from the true stress because the effect of the transverse stresses is not taken into 
account. 
Bending moment  Reference is to a simple straight beam, assumed for convenience to be 
horizontal and loaded and supported by forces, all of which lie in a vertical plane. The 
bending moment at any section of the beam is the moment of all forces that act on the beam 
to the left (or right) of that section, taken about the horizontal axis in the plane of the section. 
When considering the moment at the section due to the forces to the left of the section, the 
bending moment is positive when counterclockwise and negative when clockwise. The 
reverse is true when considering the moment due to forces to the right of the section. Thus, 
a positive bending moment bends the beam such that the beam deforms concave upward, 
and a negative bending moment bends it concave downward. The bending moment equation 
is an expression for the bending moment at any section in terms of x, the distance along the

longitudinal axis of the beam to the section measured from an origin, usually taken to be the 
left end of the beam. 
  Bending moments as applied to straight beams in two-plane symmetric or unsymmetric 
bending, curved beams, or plates are a bit more involved and are discussed in the appropriate 
sections of this book. 
Bending stress (ﬂexural stress)  The tensile and compressive stress transmitted in a beam or 
plate that arises from the bending moment. (See also Flexure equation.) 
Boundary conditions  As used in structural analysis, the term usually refers to the condition of 
stress, displacement, or slope at the ends or edges of a member, where these conditions are 
apparent from the circumstances of the problem. For example, given a beam with ﬁxed ends, 
the zero displacement and slope at each end are boundary conditions. For a plate with a freely 
supported edge, the zero-stress state is a boundary condition. 
Brittle fracture  The tensile failure of a material with negligible plastic deformation. The 
material can inherently be a brittle material in its normal state such as glass, masonry, 
ceramic, cast iron, or high strength high-carbon steel (see Sec. 3.7); or it can be a material 
normally considered ductile which contains imperfections exceeding speciﬁc limits, or in a 
low-temperature environment, or undergoing high strain rates, or any combination 
thereof. 
Bulk modulus of elasticity 
The ratio of a tensile or compressive stress, triaxial and 
equal in all directions (e.g., hydrostatic pressure) to the relative change it produces in 
volume. 
Central axis (centroidal axis)  A central axis of a line, area, or volume is one that passes 
through the centroid; in the case of an area, it is understood to lie in the plane of the area 
unless stated otherwise. When taken normal to the plane of the area, it is called the central 
polar axis. 
Centroid of an area  That point in the plane of an area where the moment of the area is zero 
about any axis. The centroid coincides with the center of gravity in the plane of an inﬁnitely 
thin homogeneous uniform plate. 
Corrosion fatigue  Fatigue aggravated by corrosion, as in parts repeatedly stressed while 
exposed to a corrosive environment. 
Creep  Continuous increase in deformation under constant or decreasing stress. The term is 
ordinarily used with reference to the behavior of metals under tension at elevated 
temperatures. The similar yielding of a material under compressive stress is called plastic 
ﬂow, or ﬂow. Creep at atmospheric temperature due to sustained elastic stress is sometimes 
called drift, or elastic drift. (See also Relaxation.) 
Damaging stress  The least unit stress of a given kind and for a given material and condition 
of service that will render a member unﬁt for service before the end of its useful life. It may 
do this by excessive deformation, by excessive yielding or creep, or through fatigue cracking, 
excessive strain hardening, or rupture. 
Damping capacity  The amount of energy dissipated into heat per unit of total strain energy 
present at maximum strain for a complete cycle. (See Ref. 4.) 
Deformation  Change in the shape or dimensions of a body produced by stress. Elongation 
is often used for tensile deformation, compression or shortening for com­pressive 

G l o s s a r y

deformation, and distortion for shear deformation. Elastic deformation is deformation that 
invari­ably disappears upon removal of stress, whereas permanent deforma­tion is that which 
remains after the removal of stress. (Compare with Set.) 
Eccentricity  A load or component of a load normal to a given cross section of a member is 
eccentric with respect to that section if it does not act through the centroid. The perpendicular 
distance from the line of action of the load to the central polar axis is the eccentricity with 
respect to that axis. 
Elastic  Capable of sustaining stress without permanent deforma­tion; the term is also used 
to denote conformity to the law of stress– strain proportionality (Hooke’s law). An elastic 
stress or strain is a stress or strain within the elastic limit. 
Elastic axis  The elastic axis of a beam is the line, lengthwise of the beam, along which 
transverse loads must be applied to avoid torsion of the beam at any section. Strictly 
speaking, no such line exists except for a few conditions of loading. Usually the elastic axis 
is assumed to be the line through the elastic center of every section. The term is most often 
used with reference to an airplane wing of either the shell or multiple spar type. (Compare 
with Torsional center; Flexural center; Elastic center. See Ref. 5.) 
Elastic center  The elastic center of a given section of a beam is that point in the plane of the 
section lying midway between the shear center and center of twist of that section. The three 
points may be identical—which is the normal assumption. (Compare with Shear center; 
Torsional center; Elastic axis. See Refs. 5 and 6.) 
Elastic curve  The curve assumed by the longitudinal axis of an initially straight beam or 
column in bending where the stress is within the elastic limit. 
Elastic instability (buckling)  Unstable local or global elastic deformations caused by 
compressive stresses in members with large length to lateral dimensions. (See 
Slenderness ratio.) 
Elastic, perfectly plastic material  A model that represents the stress–strain curve of a material 
as linear from zero stress and strain to the elastic limit. Beyond the elastic limit, the stress 
remains constant with strain. 
Elastic limit  The least stress that will cause permanent set. (Compare with Proportional limit; 
Apparent elastic limit, Yield point; Yield strength. See Sec. 3.2 and Ref. 7.) 
Elastic ratio  The ratio of the elastic limit to the ultimate strength. 
Ellipsoid of strain  An ellipsoid that represents the state of strain at any given point in a body. 
It has the shape assumed under stress by a sphere centered at the point in question (Ref. 8). 
Ellipsoid of stress  An ellipsoid that represents the state of stress at any given point in a 
body; its semi-axes are vectors representing the principal stresses at the point, and any radius 
vector represents the resultant stress on a particular plane through the point. For a condition 
of plane stress, where one of the principal stresses is zero, the ellipsoid becomes the ellipse of 
stress (see Ref. 9). 
Endurance limit (fatigue strength)  The maximum stress ampli­tude of a purely reversing 
stress that can be applied to a material an indeﬁnitely large number of cycles without 
producing fracture (see Sec. 3.8). 
Endurance ratio  Ratio of the endurance limit to the ultimate static tensile strength. 

1026	
A p p e n d i x  C
Endurance strength  The maximum stress amplitude of a purely reversing stress that can be 
applied to a material for a speciﬁc number of cycles without producing fracture. (Compare 
with Endurance limit.) 
Energy of rupture (modulus of toughness)  The work done per unit volume in producing 
fracture. It is not practicable to establish a speciﬁc energy of rupture value for a given 
material, because the result obtained depends upon the form and proportions of the test 
specimen and the manner of loading. As determined by similar tests on similar specimens, 
the energy of rupture affords a criterion for comparing the toughness of different 
materials. 
Equivalent bending moment  A bending moment that, acting alone, would produce in a 
circular shaft a normal (tensile or compres­sive) stress of the same magnitude as the maximum 
normal stress produced by a given bending moment and a given twisting moment acting 
simultaneously. 
Equivalent twisting moment 
A twisting moment that, acting alone, would produce in a 
circular shaft a shear stress of the same magnitude as the maximum shear stress 
produced by a given twisting moment and a given bending moment acting 
simultaneously. 
Factor of safety  The intent of the factor of safety is to provide a safeguard to failure. The 
term usually refers to the ratio of the load that would cause failure of a member or structure 
to the load that is imposed upon it in service. The term may also be used to represent the 
ratio of the failure to service value of speed, deﬂection, temperature variation, or other 
stress-producing quantities. (Compare with Allow­able stress; Margin of safety.) 
Fatigue  The fracture of a material under many repetitions of a stress at a level considerably 
less than the ultimate strength of the material. 
Fatigue strength  See Endurance limit. 
Fixed (clamped) 
A support condition at the end of a beam or column or at the edge of a 
plate or shell that prevents rotation and transverse displacement of the edge of the neutral 
surface but permits longitudinal displacement. (Compare Guided; Held; Simply supported.) 
Flexural center  See Shear center. 
Flexural rigidity (beam, plate)  A measure of the resistance of the bending deformation of a 
beam or plate. For a beam, the ﬂexural rigidity is given by EI; whereas for a plate of thickness 
t, it is given by Et3/[12(1 - v)].
Flexure equation  The equation for tensile and compressive stresses in beams undergoing 
bending, given by s = Mc/I. 
Form factor  The term is applied to several situations pertaining to beams: 
	
(1)	 Given a beam section of a given shape, the form factor is the ratio of the modulus of 
rupture of a beam having that particular section to the modulus of rupture of a 
beam otherwise similar but having a section adopted as a standard. This standard 
section is usually taken as rectangular or square; for wood it is a 2 in by 2 in square 
with edges horizontal and vertical (see Secs. 3.11 and 8.15). 
	 (2)	 For the shear deﬂection of a beam due to transverse loading, the form factor is a 
correction factor that is the ratio of the actual shear deﬂection to the shear 

G l o s s a r y 	
1027
deﬂection calculated on the assump­tion of a uniform shear stress across the section 
(see Sec. 8.10). 
	
(3)	 For a given maximum ﬁber stress within the elastic limit, the form factor is the ratio 
of the actual resisting moment of a wide-ﬂanged beam to the resisting moment the 
beam would develop if the ﬁber stress were uniformly distributed across the entire 
width of the ﬂanges. So used, the term expresses the strength-reducing effort of 
shear lag. 
Fracture toughness, KIc  A material property which describes the ability of a material 
containing a crack to resist fracture. Has the units of MPa-m1/2.  See Chap. 19 for more 
details.
Fretting fatigue (chaﬁng fatigue)  Fatigue aggravated by surface rubbing, as in shafts with 
press-ﬁtted collars. 
Guided 
A support condition at the end of a beam or column or at the edge of a plate 
or shell that prevents rotation of the edge of the neutral surface in the plane of bending but 
permits longitudinal and transverse displacement. (Compare with Fixed; Held; Simply 
supported.) 
Held  A support condition at the end of a beam or column or at the edge of a plate or shell 
that prevents longitudinal and transverse displacement of the edge of the neutral surface but 
permits rotation in the plane of bending. (Compare with Fixed; Guided; Simply supported.) 
Hertzian stress (contact stress)  Stress caused by the pressure between elastic bodies in 
contact. 
Hysteresis  The dissipation of energy as heat during a stress cycle of a member. 
Inﬂuence line  Usually pertaining to a particular section of a beam, an inﬂuence line is a 
curve drawn so that its ordinate at any point represents the value of the reaction, vertical 
shear, bending moment, or deﬂection produced at the particular section by a unit load 
applied at the point where the ordinate is measured. An inﬂuence line may be used to show 
the effect of load position on any quantity dependent thereon, such as the stress in a given 
truss member, the deﬂection of a truss, or the twisting moment in a shaft. 
Isoclinic  A line (in a stressed body) at all points on which the corresponding principal 
stresses have the same direction. 
Isotropic  Having the same properties in all directions. In discus­sions pertaining to strength 
of materials, isotropic usually means having the same strength and elastic prop­erties (modulus 
of elasticity, modulus of rigidity, and Poisson’s ratio) in all directions.
Kern (kernal)  Reference is to some particular section of a member. The kern is that area in 
the plane of a section through which the line of action of a force must pass if that force is to 
produce, at all points in the given section, the same kind of normal stress, i.e., tension 
throughout or compression throughout. 
Limit load  The ﬁctitious theoretical load that the cross section of a member made of an 
elastic, perfectly plastic material reaches when the entire section goes into the plastic range.
Lüder’s lines  See Slip lines. 

1028	
A p p e n d i x  C
Margin of safety  As used in aeronautical design, margin of safety is the percentage by which 
the ultimate strength of a member exceeds the design load. The design load is the applied load, 
or maximum probable load, multiplied by a speciﬁed factor of safety. [The use of the terms 
margin of safety and design load in this sense is practically restricted to aeronautical engineering 
(see Ref. 11).] 
Member  Any single part or element of a machine or structure, such as a beam, column, 
shaft, etc. 
Modulus of elasticity, E (Young’s modulus)  The rate of change of normal stress, s, to normal 
strain, e, for the condition of uniaxial stress within the proportional limit of a given material. 
For most, but not all, materials, the modulus of elasticity is the same for tension and 
compression. For nonisotropic materials such as wood, it is necessary to distinguish between 
the moduli of elasticity in different directions. 
Modulus of resilience  The strain energy per unit volume absorbed up to the elastic limit 
under conditions of uniform uniaxial stress. 
Modulus of rigidity, G (modulus of elasticity in shear)  The rate of change of shear stress, t, with 
respect to shear strain, g, within the proportional limit of a given material. For nonisotropic 
materials such as wood, it is necessary to distinguish between the moduli of rigidity in 
different directions. 
Modulus of rupture in bending (computed ultimate bending strength)  The ﬁctitious normal 
stress in the extreme ﬁber of a beam computed by the ﬂexure equation s = MRc/I, where MR 
is the bending moment that causes rupture. 
Modulus of rupture in torsion (computed ultimate torsional strength)  The ﬁctitious shear stress 
at the outer radius of a circular shaft computed by the torsion equation t = TRr/J, where TR is 
the torsional moment that causes rupture. 
Moment of an area (ﬁrst moment of an area)  With respect to an axis within the plane of an 
area, the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each element of the area dA by its 
distance, y, from the axis: it is therefore the quantity ∫ y dA. 
Moment of inertia of an area (second moment of an area)  With respect to an axis x within the 
xy plane of an area, the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each element of the 
area dA by the square of the distance y from the x axis: it is thus the quantity Ix = ∫ y2 dA 
(see App. A). 
Neutral axis  The line of zero ﬁber stress in any given section of a member subject to bending; 
it is the line formed by the intersection of the neutral surface and the section. 
Neutral surface  The longitudinal surface of zero ﬁber stress in a member subject to bending; 
it contains the neutral axis of every section. 
Notch-sensitivity factor  Used to compare the stress concentration factor Kt and fatigue-strength 
reduction factor Kf . The notch-sensi­tivity factor q is commonly deﬁned as the ratio (Kf - 1)/ 
(Kt - 1), and varies from 0, for some soft ductile materials, to 1, for some hard brittle 
materials. 
Plane strain  A condition where the normal and shear strains in a particular direction are 
zero; e.g., ez = γzx = γzy = 0.
Plane stress  A condition where the normal and shear stresses in a particular direction are 
zero; e.g., σz = τzx = τzy = 0.

G l o s s a r y 	
1029
Plastic moment; plastic hinge; plastic section modulus  The maximum hypothetical bending 
moment for which the stresses in all ﬁbers of a section of a ductile member in bending reach 
the lower yield point sy is called the plastic moment, Mp. Under this condition the section 
cannot accommodate any additional load, and a plastic hinge is said to form. The section 
modulus Zp is deﬁned as Mp/sy.
Plasticity  The property of sustaining appreciable permanent defor­mation without 
rupture. The term is also used to denote the property of yielding or ﬂowing under steady 
load (Ref. 13). 
Poisson’s ratio, m  The ratio of lateral to longitudinal strain under the condition of uniform 
and uniaxial longitudinal stress within the proportional limit. 
Polar moment of inertia 
With respect to an axis normal to the plane of an area, the 
sum of the products obtained by multiplying each element of the area dA by the 
square of the distance r from the axis; it is thus the quantity ∫ r2 dA (see App. A). 
Principal axes of inertia  The two mutually perpendicular axes in the plane of an area, 
centered at the centroid of the area, with mo­ments of inertia that are maximum and minimum 
(see App. A). 
Principal axes of stress  The three mutually perpendicular axes at a speciﬁc point within a 
solid where the state of stress on each surface normal to the axes contains a tensile or 
compressive stress and zero shear stress. 
Principal moment of inertia  The moment of inertia of an area about a principal axis of inertia 
(see App. A). 
Principal stresses  The tensile or compressive stresses acting along the principal axes of 
stress. 
Product of inertia of an area  With respect to a pair of xy rectangular axes in the plane of an 
area, the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each element of area dA by the 
coordinates with respect to these axes; that is, ∫ xy dA (see App. A). The product of inertia 
relative to the principal axes of inertia is zero. 
Proof stress  Pertaining to acceptance tests of metals, a speciﬁed tensile stress that must be 
sustained without deformation in excess of a speciﬁed amount. 
Proportional limit  The greatest stress that a material can sustain without deviating from the 
law of stress–strain proportionality (Hookes’ law). (Compare Apparent elastic limit; Elastic limit; 
Yield point; Yield strength. See Sec. 3.2 and Ref. 8.) 
Radius of gyration, k  The radius of gyration of an area with respect to a given axis is the square 
root of the quantity obtained by dividing the moment of inertia of the area I with respect to 
that axis by the area A; that is, k
I A
=
/  (see App. A).
Reduction of area  The difference between the cross-sectional areas of a tensile specimen at 
the section of rupture before loading and after rupture. 
Relaxation 
The reduction in stress when the deformation is main­tained constant. 
(Compare with Creep.) 
Rupture factor 
Used in reference to brittle materials, i.e., mate­rials in which failure occurs 
through tensile rupture rather than excessive deformation. For a member of given form, size, 

1030	
A p p e n d i x  C
and material, loaded and supported in a given manner, the rupture factor is the ratio of the 
ﬁctitious maximum tensile stress at failure, as calculated by the appropriate formula for 
elastic stress, to the ultimate tensile strength of the material, as determined by a conventional 
tension test (Sec. 3.11).
Saint-Venant’s principle  If a load distribution is replaced by a statically equivalent force 
system, the distribution of stress through­out the body is possibly altered only near the 
regions of load applica­tion. 
Section modulus (section factor), S  Pertaining to the cross section of a beam, the section 
modulus with respect to either principal axis of inertia is the moment of inertia with respect 
to that axis, I, divided by the distance from that axis to the most remote point of the section, 
c; that is, S = I/c. (Compare with Plastic section modulus.) 
Set (permanent deformation)  Strain remaining after the removal of the applied loading. 
Shakedown load (stabilizing load)  The maximum load that can be applied to a beam or rigid 
frame and upon removal leave residual moments such that subsequent applications of the 
same or a smaller load will cause only elastic stresses. 
Shape factor  The ratio of the plastic section modulus to the elastic section modulus. 
Shear center (ﬂexural center)  With reference to a beam, the shear center of any section is that 
point in the plane of the section through which a transverse load, applied at the section, 
must act to produce bending deﬂection only and no twist of the section. (Compare with 
Torsional center; Elastic center; Elastic axis. See Refs. 5 and 10.) 
Shear lag  Because of shear strain, the longitudinal tensile or compressive bending stresses 
in wide beam ﬂanges decrease with the distance from the web(s), and this stress reduction is 
called shear lag. 
Simply supported  A support condition at the end of a beam or column or at the edge of a 
plate or shell that prevents transverse displacement of the edge of the neutral surface but 
permits rotation and longitudinal displacement. (Compare with Fixed, Guided; Held.) 
Singularity functions  A class of mathematical functions that can be used to describe 
discontinuous behavior using one equation. Singu­larity functions are commonly employed 
to represent shear forces, bending moments, slopes, and deformations as functions of 
position for discontinuous loading of beams, plates, and shells. The functions are written 
using bracket notation as Fn = 〈x - a〉n, where Fn = 0 for x ≤ a, and Fn = (x = a)n for x > a. (See 
Ref. 12.) 
Slenderness ratio  The ratio of length of a uniform column to the minimum radius of gyration 
of the cross section. 
Slip lines (Lüder’s lines)  Lines that appear on the polished surface of a crystal or crystalline 
body that has been stressed beyond the elastic limit. They represent the intersection of the 
surface by planes on which shear stress has produced plastic slip (see Sec. 3.5 and Ref. 13). 
Strain  Any forced change in the dimensions and/or shape of an elastic element. A stretch is 
a tensile strain; a shortening is a compressive strain; and an angular distortion is a shear strain. 
Strain concentration factor  Localized peak strains develop in the presence of stress raisers. 
The strain concentration factor is the ratio of the localized maximum strain at a given location 
to the nominal average strain at that location. The nominal average strain is computed from 

G l o s s a r y 	
1031
the average stress and a knowledge of the stress–strain behavior of the material. In a situation 
where all stresses and strains are elastic, the stress and strain concentration factors are equal. 
(Compare with Stress concentration factor.) 
Strain energy  Mechanical energy stored in a stressed material. Stress within the elastic limit 
is implied where the strain energy is equal to the work done by the external forces in 
producing the stress and is recoverable. 
Strain rosette  At any point on the surface of a stressed body, strains measured along each of 
three intersecting gage lines make the calculation of the principal stresses possible. The gage 
lines and the corresponding strains are called strain rosettes. 
Strength  Typically refers to a particular limiting value of stress for which a material ceases 
to behave according to some prescribed function. [Compare Endurance limit (fatigue strength); 
Endurance strength; Ultimate strength; Yield strength.] 
Stress  Internal force per unit area exerted on a speciﬁed surface. When the force is tangential 
to the surface, the stress is called a shear stress; when the force is normal to the surface, the 
stress is called a normal stress; when the normal stress is directed toward the surface, it is 
called a compressive stress; and when the normal stress is directed away from the surface, it is 
called a tensile stress. 
Stress concentration factor, Kt   Irregularities of form such as holes, screw threads, notches, and 
sharp shoulders, that, when present in a beam, shaft, or other member subject to loading, 
may produce high localized stresses. This phenomenon is called a stress concentration, and 
the form irregularities that cause it are called stress raisers. For the particular type of stress 
raiser in question, the ratio of the true maximum stress to the nominal stress calculated by 
the ordinary formulas of mechanics (P/A, Mc/I, Tc/ J, etc.) is the stress concentra­tion factor. 
The nominal stress calculation is based on the net section properties at the location of 
the stress raiser ignoring the redistribu­tion of stress caused by the form irregularity. (See 
Sec. 3.10.) 
Stress intensity factor, K 
A term employed in fracture mechanics to describe the elastic 
stress ﬁeld surrounding a crack tip caused by a remote load. The magnitude of  
K depends on the sample geometry, and the size and location of the crack. There are 
three modes associated with the stress intensity factor; Mode I, KI, or opening mode; 
Mode II, KII ,or sliding mode; and Mode III, KIII , or tearing mode. See Chap. 19 for 
more details.
Stress trajectory (isostatic)  A line (in a stressed body) tangent to the direction of one of the 
principal stresses at every point through which it passes. 
Superposition, principle of  With certain exceptions, the effect of a given combined loading on 
a structure may be resolved by determin­ing the effects of each load separately and adding 
the results alge­braically. The principle may be applied provided: (1) each effect is linearly 
related to the load that produces it, (2) a load does not create a condition which affects the 
result of another load, and (3) the deforma­tions resulting from any speciﬁc load are not large 
enough to appre­ciably alter the geometric relations of the parts of the structural system. (See 
Sec. 4.2.) 
Torsional center (center of twist) 
If a twisting couple is applied at a given section of a 
straight member, that section rotates about some point in its plane. This point, which 
does not move when the member twists, is the torsional center of that section. (See Refs. 5 
and 6.) 

1032	
A p p e n d i x  C
Torsional moment (torque, twisting moment)  At any section of a member, the moment of all 
forces that act on the member to the left (or right) of that section, taken about a polar axis 
through the ﬂexural center of that section. For sections that are symmetrical about each 
principal axis, the ﬂexural center coincides with the centroid (see Refs. 6 and 10). 
Transformations of stress or strain  Conversions of stress or strain at a point from one three-
dimensional coordinate system to another. (See Secs. 2.3 and 2.4.)
Transverse shear force (vertical shear)  Reference is to a simple straight beam, assumed for 
convenience to be horizontal and loaded and supported by forces, all of which lie in a verti­cal 
plane. The transverse shear force at any section of the beam is the vertical component of all 
forces that act on the beam to the left (or right) of that section. The shear force equation is an 
expression for the trans­verse shear at any section in terms of x, the distance to that section 
measured from a chosen origin, usually taken from the left of the beam.
Tresca stress  Based on the failure mode of a ductile material being due to shear stress, the 
Tresca stress is a single shear stress value, which is equivalent to an actual combined state of 
stress. 
True strain  The summation (integral) of each inﬁnitesimal elonga­tion DL of successive 
values of a speciﬁc gage length L divided by that length. It is equal to ∫L
L dL L
0(
)
/
 = loge (L/L0) = 
loge (1 + e), where L0 is the original gage length and e is the normal strain as ordinarily 
deﬁned (Ref. 14). 
True stress  For an axially loaded bar, the force divided by the actual cross-sectional area 
undergoing loading. It differs from the engineering stress deﬁned in terms of the original 
area. 
Ultimate elongation  The percentage of permanent deformation remaining after tensile 
rupture (measured over an arbitrary length including the section of rupture). 
Ultimate strength  The ultimate strength of a material in uniaxial tension or compression, or 
pure shear, respectively, is the maximum tensile, compressive, or shear stress that the 
material can sustain calculated on the basis of the greatest load achieved prior to fracture 
and the original unstrained dimensions. 
von Mises stress  Based on the failure mode of a ductile material being due to distortional 
energy caused by a stress state, the von Mises stress is a single normal stress value, which is 
equivalent to an actual combined state of stress. 
Yield point  The stress at which the strain increases without an increase in stress. For some 
purposes, it is important to distinguish between upper and lower yield points. When they 
occur, the upper yield point is reached ﬁrst and is a maxima that is followed by the lower 
yield point, a minima. Only a few materials exhibit a true yield point. For other materials the 
term is sometimes used synonymously with yield strength. (Compare Apparent elastic limit; 
Elastic limit; Proportional limit; Yield strength. See Ref. 7.) 
Yield strength  The stress at which a material exhibits a speciﬁed permanent deformation or 
set. This stress is usually determined by the offset method, where the strain departs from 
the linear portion of the actual stress–strain diagram by an offset unit strain of 0.002. (See 
Ref. 7.)
