PREFACE
The goal of this book is to give you the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed
in calculus. Much of the difﬁculty calculus students face is with algebra. They have
to solve equations, ﬁnd equations of lines, study graphs, solve word problems, and
rewrite expressions—all of these require a solid background in algebra. You will
get experience with all this and more in this book. Not only will you learn about the
basic functions in this book, you also will strengthen your algebra skills because
all of the examples and most of the solutions are given with a lot of detail. Enough
steps are given in the problems to make the reasoning easy to follow.
Thebasicfunctionscoveredinthisbookarelinear, polynomial, andrationalfunc-
tions, as well as exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions. Because
understanding the slope of a line is crucial to making sense of calculus, the interpre-
tation of a line’s slope is given extra attention. Other calculus topics introduced in
this book are Newton’s Quotient, the average rate of change, increasing/decreasing
intervals of a function, and optimizing functions. Your experience with these ideas
will help you when you learn calculus.
Concepts are presented in clear, simple language, followed by detailed examples.
To make sure you understand the material, each section ends with a set of practice
problems. Each chapter ends with a multiple-choice test, and there is a ﬁnal exam
at the end of the book. You will get the most from this book if you work steadily
from the beginning to the end. Because much of the material is sequential, you
should review the ideas in the previous section. Study for each end-of-chapter test
as if it really were a test, and take it without looking at examples and without using
notes. This will let you know what you have learned and where, if anywhere, you
need to spend more time.
Good luck.

CHAPTER
The Slope and
Equation of a Line
The slope of a line and the meaning of the slope are important in calculus. In fact,
the slope formula is the basis for differential calculus. The slope of a line measures
its tilt. The sign of the slope tells us if the line tilts up (if the slope is positive)
or tilts down (if the slope is negative). The larger the number, the steeper the
slope.
We can put any two points on the line, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), in the slope formula
to ﬁnd the slope of the line.
m = y2 −y1
x2 −x1

The Slope and Equation
2
Fig. 1.1.
Fig. 1.2.
For example, (0, 3), (−2, 2), (6, 6), and (−1, 5
2) are all points on the same line.
We can pick any pair of points to compute the slope.
m = 2 −3

−2 = 1

−6 = 1
2
A slope of 1
2 means that if we increase the x-value by 2, then we need to increase
the y-value by 1 to get another point on the line. For example, knowing that (0, 3)
is on the line means that we know (0 + 2, 3 + 1) = (2, 4) is also on the line.

CHAPTER 1
The Slope and Equation
3
Fig. 1.3.
Fig. 1.4.
As we can see from Figure 1.4, (−4, −2) and (1, −2) are two points on a
horizontal line. We will put these points in the slope formula.
m = −2 −(−2)
1 −(−4) = 0
5 = 0
The slope of every horizontal line is 0. The y-values on a horizontal line do not
change but the x-values do.
What happens to the slope formula for a vertical line?

CHAPTER 1
The Slope and Equation
4
Fig. 1.5.
The points (3, 2) and (3, −1) are on the vertical line in Figure 1.5. Let’s see what
happens when we put them in the slope formula.
m = −1 −2
3 −3 = −3
0
This is not a number so the slope of a vertical line does not exist (we also say that
it is undeﬁned). The x-values on a vertical line do not change but the y-values do.
Any line is the graph of a linear equation. The equation of a horizontal line
is y = a (where a is the y-value of every point on the line). Some examples of
horizontal lines are y = 4, y = 1, and y = −5.
Fig. 1.6.

CHAPTER 1
The Slope and Equation
5
The equation of a vertical line is x = a (where a is the x-value of every point
on the line). Some examples are x = −3, x = 2, and x = 4.
Fig. 1.7.
Otherequationsusuallycomeinoneoftwoforms: Ax+By = C andy = mx+b.
We will usually use the form y = mx + b in this book. An equation in this form
gives us two important pieces of information. The ﬁrst is m, the slope. The second
is b, the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis). For this reason, this form
is called the slope-intercept form. In the line y = 2
3x + 4, the slope of the line is 2
3
and the y-intercept is (0, 4), or simply, 4.
We can ﬁnd an equation of a line by knowing its slope and any point on the line.
There are two common methods for ﬁnding this equation. One is to put m, x, and y
(x and y are the coordinates of the point we know) in y = mx + b and use algebra
to ﬁnd b. The other is to put these same numbers in the point-slope form of the line,
y −y1 = m(x −x1). We will use both methods in the next example.
EXAMPLES
•
Find an equation of the line with slope −3
4 containing the point (8, −2).
We will let m = −3
4, x = 8, and y = −2 in y = mx + b to ﬁnd b.
−2 = −3
4(8) + b
4 = b
The line is y = −3
4x + 4.

CHAPTER 1
The Slope and Equation
6
Now we will let m = −3
4, x1 = 8 and y1 = −2 in y −y1 = m(x −x1).
y −(−2) = −3
4(x −8)
y + 2 = −3
4x + 6
y = −3
4x + 4
•
Find an equation of the line with slope 4, containing the point (0, 3).
We know the slope is 4 and we know the y-intercept is 3 (because (0, 3) is
on the line), so we can write the equation without having to do any work:
y = 4x + 3.
•
Find an equation of the horizontal line that contains the point (5, −6).
Because the y-values are the same on a horizontal line, we know that this
equation is y = −6. We can still ﬁnd the equation algebraically using the fact
that m = 0, x = 5 and y = −6. Then y = mx + b becomes −6 = 0(5) + b.
From here we can see that b = −6, so y = 0x −6, or simply, y = −6.
•
Find an equation of the vertical line containing the point (10, −1).
Because the x-values are the same on a vertical line, we know that the
equation is x = 10. We cannot ﬁnd this equation algebraically because m
does not exist.
We can ﬁnd an equation of a line if we know any two points on the line. First
we need to use the slope formula to ﬁnd m. Then we will pick one of the points to
put into y = mx + b.
EXAMPLES
Find an equation of the line containing the given points.
•
(−2, 3) and (10, 15)
m =
15 −3
10 −(−2) = 1
We will use x = −2 and y = 3 in y = mx + b to ﬁnd b.
3 = 1(−2) + b
5 = b
The equation is y = 1x + 5, or simply y = x + 5.

7 = b.
The equation is y = 8
7x −11
7 .
•
(0, 1) and (12, 1)
The y-values are the same, making this a horizontal line. The equation is
y = 1.
If a graph is clear enough, we can ﬁnd two points on the line or even its slope.
If fact, if the slope and y-intercept are easy enough to see on the graph, we know
right away what the equation is.
EXAMPLES
•
Fig. 1.8.
The line in Figure 1.8 crosses the y-axis at 1, so b = 1. From this point, we
can go right 2 and up 3 to reach the point (2, 4) on the line. “Right 2” means
that the denominator of the slope is 2. “Up 3” means that the numerator of
the slope is 3. The slope is 3
2, so the equation of the line is y = 3
2x + 1.

CHAPTER 1
The Slope and Equation

•
Fig. 1.9.
The y-intercept is not easy to determine, but we do have two points. We
can either ﬁnd the slope by using the slope formula, or visually (as we
did above). We can ﬁnd the slope visually by asking how we can go from
(−4, 3) to (2, −1): Down 4 (making the numerator of the slope −4) and
right 6 (making the denominator 6). If we use the slope formula, we have
m = −1 −3
2 −(−4) = −4
6 = −2
3.
Using x = 2 and y = −1 in y = mx + b, we have −1 = −2
3(2) + b. From
this, we have b = 1
3. The equation is y = −2
3x + 1
3.
•
Fig. 1.10.
The line in Figure 1.10 is vertical, so it has the form x = a. All of the
x-values are −2, so the equation is x = −2.

CHAPTER 1
The Slope and Equation
9
When an equation for a line is in the form Ax + By = C, we can ﬁnd
the slope by solving the equation for y. This will put the equation in the form
y = mx + b.
EXAMPLE
•
Find the slope of the line 6x −2y = 3.
6x −2y = 3
−2y = −6x + 3
y = 3x −3
2
The slope is 3 (or 3
1).
Two lines are parallel if their slopes are equal (or if both lines are vertical).
Fig. 1.11.
Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals of each
other (or if one line is horizontal and the other is vertical). Two numbers are
negative reciprocals of each other if one is positive and the other is negative and
inverting one gets the other (if we ignore the sign).

We can decide whether two lines are parallel or perpendicular or neither by
putting them in the form y = mx + b and comparing their slopes.
EXAMPLES
Determine whether the lines are parallel or perpendicular or neither.
•
4x −3y = −15 and 4x −3y = 6
4x −3y = −15
4x −3y = 6
−3y = −4x −15
−3y = −4x + 6
y = 4
3x + 5
y = 4
3x −2
The lines have the same slope, so they are parallel.
•
3x −5y = 20 and 5x −3y = −15
3x −5y = 20
5x −3y = −15
−5y = −3x + 20
−3y = −5x −15
y = 3
5x −4
y = 5
3x + 5
The slopes are reciprocals of each other but not negative reciprocals, so they
are not perpendicular. They are not parallel, either.

CHAPTER 1
The Slope and Equation
11
•
x −y = 2 and x + y = −8
x −y = 2
x + y = −8
y = x −2
y = −x −8
The slope of the ﬁrst line is 1 and the second is −1. Because 1 and −1 are
negative reciprocals, these lines are perpendicular.
•
y = 10 and x = 3
The line y = 10 is horizontal, and the line x = 3 is vertical. They are
perpendicular.
Sometimes we need to ﬁnd an equation of a line when we know only a point on
the line and an equation of another line that is either parallel or perpendicular to it.
We need to ﬁnd the slope of the line whose equation we have and use this to ﬁnd
the equation of the line we are looking for.
EXAMPLES
•
Find an equation of the line containing the point (−4, 5) that is parallel to
the line y = 2x + 1.
The slope of y = 2x + 1 is 2. This is the same as the line we want, so we
will let x = −4, y = 5, and m = 2 in y = mx + b. We get 5 = 2(−4) + b,
so b = 13. The equation of the line we want is y = 2x + 13.
•
Find an equation of the line with x-intercept 4 that is perpendicular to
x −3y = 12.
The x-intercept is 4 means that the point (4, 0) is on the line. The slope
of the line we want will be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line
x −3y = 12. We will ﬁnd the slope of x −3y = 12 by solving for y.
x −3y = 12
y = 1
3x −4
The slope we want is −3, which is the negative reciprocal of 1
3. When we let
x = 4, y = 0, and m = −3 in y = mx + b, we have 0 = −3(4) + b, which
gives us b = 12. The line is y = −3x + 12.
•
Find an equation of the line containing the point (3, −8), perpendicular to
the line y = 9.
The line y = 9 is horizontal, so the line we want is vertical. The vertical line
passing through (3, −8) is x = 3.

PRACTICE
When asked to ﬁnd an equation for a line, put your answer in the form y = mx + b
unless the line is horizontal (y = a) or vertical (x = a).
1. Find the slope of the line containing the points (4, 12) and (−6, 1).
2. Find the slope of the line with x-intercept 5 and y-intercept −3.
3. Find an equation of the line containing the point (−10, 4) with slope
−2
5.
4. Find an equation of the line with y-intercept −5 and slope 2.
5. Find an equation of the line in Figure 1.13.
Fig. 1.13.
6. Find an equation of the line containing the points (3
4, 1) and (−2, −1).
7. Determine whether the lines 3x −7y = 28 and 7x + 3y = 3 are parallel
or perpendicular or neither.
8. Find an equation of the line containing (2, 3) and perpendicular to the line
x −y = 5.
9. Find an equation of the line parallel to the line x = 6 containing the point
(−3, 2).
10. Determine whether the lines 2x −3y = 1 and −4x + 6y = 5 are parallel
or perpendicular or neither.

SOLUTIONS
1. m = 1 −12
−6 −4 = −11
−10 = 11
10
2. The x-intercept is 5 and the y-intercept is −3 mean that the points (5, 0)
and (0, −3) are on the line.
m = −3 −0
0 −5 = −3
−5 = 3
5
3. Put x = −10, y = 4, and m = −2
5 in y = mx + b to ﬁnd b.
4 = −2
5(−10) + b
0 = b
The equation is y = −2
5x + 0, or simply y = −2
5x.
4. m = 2, b = −5, so the line is y = 2x −5.
5. From the graph, we can see that the y-intercept is 3. We can use the
indicated points (0, 3) and (2, 0) to ﬁnd the slope in two ways. One way
is to put these numbers in the slope formula.
m = 0 −3
2 −0 = −3
2
The other way is to move from (0, 3) to (2, 0) by going down 3 (so the
numerator of the slope is −3) and right 2 (so the denominator is 2). Either
way, we have the slope −3
2. Because the y-intercept is 3, the equation
is y = −3
2x + 3.

−2 −3
4

−11
4
= −2 ÷ −11
4 = −2 · −4
11 = 8
11
We will use x = −2 and y = −1 in y = mx + b.
−1 = 8
11(−2) + b
5
11 = b
The equation is y = 8
11x + 5
11.

CHAPTER 1
The Slope and Equation
14
7. We will solve for y in each equation so that we can compare their slopes.
3x −7y = 28
7x + 3y = 3
y = 3
7x −4
y = −7
3x + 1
The slopes are negative reciprocals of each other, so these lines are
perpendicular.
8. Once we have found the slope for the line x −y = 5, we will use its
negative reciprocal as the slope of the line we want.
x −y = 5
y = x −5
The slope of this line is 1. The negative reciprocal of 1 is −1. We will use
x = 2, y = 3, and m = −1 in y = mx + b.
3 = −1(2) + b
5 = b
The equation is y = −1x + 5, or simply y = −x + 5.
9. The line x = 6 is vertical, so the line we want is also vertical. The vertical
line that goes through (−3, 2), is x = −3.
10. We will solve for y in each equation and compare their slopes.
2x −3y = 1
−4x + 6y = 5
y = 2
3x −1
3
y = 2
3x + 5
6
The slopes are the same, so these lines are parallel.
Applications of Lines and Slopes
We can use the slope of a line to decide whether points in the plane form certain
shapes. Here, we will use the slope to decide whether or not three points form a
right triangle and whether or not four points form a parallelogram. After we plot
the points, we can decide which points to put into the slope formula.

EXAMPLES
•
Show that (−1, 2), (4, −3), and (5, 0) are the vertices of a right triangle.
Fig. 1.14.
From the graph in Figure 1.14, we can see that the line segment between (5, 0)
and (−1, 2) should be perpendicular to the line segment between (5, 0) and
(4, −3). Once we have found the slopes of these line segments, we will see
that they are negative reciprocals.
m = 2 −0
−1 −5 = −1

m = −3 −0
4 −5 = 3
•
Show that (−3, 1), (3, −5), (4, −1), and (−2, 5) are the vertices of a
parallelogram.
Fig. 1.15.

CHAPTER 1
The Slope and Equation
16
From the graph in Figure 1.15, we see that we need to show that line
segments a and c are parallel and that line segments b and d are parallel.
The slope for segment a is m =
5 −1
−2 −(−3) = 4,
and the slope for segment c is m = −1 −(−5)
4 −3
= 4.
The slope for segment b is m = −5 −1
3 −(−3) = −1,
and the slope for segment d is m = −1 −5
4 −(−2) = −1.
There are many applications of linear equations to business and science.
Suppose the property tax rate for a school district is $1.50 per $100 valuation.
This is a linear relationship between the value of the property and the amount of
tax on the property. The slope of the line in this relationship is
Tax change
Value change = $1.50
$100 .
As the value of property increases by $100, the tax increases by $1.50. Two vari-
ables are linearly related if a ﬁxed increase of one variable causes a ﬁxed increase
or decrease in the other variable. These changes are proportional. For example, if
a property increases in value by $50, then its tax would increase by $0.75.
We can ﬁnd an equation (also called a model) that describes the relationship
between two variables if we are given two points or one point and the slope. As in
most word problems, we will need to ﬁnd the information in the statement of the
problem, it is seldom spelled out for us. One of the ﬁrst things we need to do is to
decide which quantity will be represented by x and which by y. Sometimes it does
not matter. In the problems that follow, it will matter. If we are instructed to “give
variable 1 in terms of variable 2,” then variable 1 will be y and variable 2 will be x.
This is because in the equation y = mx + b, y is given in terms of x. For example,
if we are asked to give the property tax in terms of property value, then y would
represent the property tax and x would represent the property value.
EXAMPLES
•
Afamily paid $52.50 for water in January when they used 15,000 gallons and
$77.50 in May when they used 25,000 gallons. Find an equation that gives
the amount of the water bill in terms of the number of gallons of water used.

CHAPTER 1
The Slope and Equation
17
Because we need to ﬁnd the cost in terms of water used, we will let y
represent the cost and x, the amount of water used. Our ordered pairs will
be (water, cost): (15,000, 52.50) and (25,000, 77.50). Now we can compute
the slope.
m =
77.50 −52.50
25,000 −15,000 = 0.0025
We will use x = 15,000, y = 52.50, and m = 0.0025 in y = mx + b to
ﬁnd b.
52.50 = 0.0025(15,000) + b
15 = b
The equation is y = 0.0025x + 15. With this equation, the family can
predict its water bill by putting the amount of water used in the equation. For
example, 32,000 gallons would cost 0.0025(32,000) + 15 = $95.

A bakery sells a special bread. It costs $6000 to produce 10,000 loaves of
bread per day and $5900 to produce 9500 loaves. Find an equation that gives
the daily costs in terms of the number of loaves of bread produced.
Because we want the cost in terms of the number of loaves produced, we
will let y represent the daily cost and x, the number of loaves produced. Our
points will be of the form (number of loaves, daily cost): (10,000, 6000) and
(9500, 5900).
m =
5900 −6000
9500 −10,000 = 1
5
We will use x = 10,000, y = 6000, and m = 1
5 in y = mx + b.
6000 = 1
5(10,000) + b
4000 = b
The equation is y = 1
5x + 4000.
The slope, and sometimes the y-intercept, have important meanings in applied
problems. In the ﬁrst example, the household water bill was computed using
y = 0.0025x + 15. The slope means that each gallon costs $0.0025 (or 0.25 cents).
As the number of gallons increases by 1, the cost increases by $0.0025. The
y-intercept is the cost when 0 gallons are used. This additional monthly charge
is $15. The slope in the bakery problem means that ﬁve loaves of bread costs $1 to

produce (or each loaf costs $0.20). The y-intercept tells us the bakery’s daily ﬁxed
costs are $4000. Fixed costs are costs that the bakery must pay regardless of the
number of loaves produced. Fixed costs might include rent, equipment payments,
insurance, taxes, etc.
In the following examples, information about the slope will be given and a point
will be given or implied.
•
The dosage of medication given to an adult cow is 500 mg plus 9 mg per
pound. Find an equation that gives the amount of medication (in mg) per
pound of weight.
We will use 500 mg as the y-intercept. The slope is
increase in medication
increase in weight

The equation is y = 9x + 500, where x is in pounds and y is in milligrams.
•
At the surface of the ocean, a certain object has 1500 pounds of pressure
on it. For every foot below the surface, the pressure on the object increases
about 43 pounds. Find an equation that gives the pressure (in pounds) on the
object in terms of its depth (in feet) in the ocean.
At 0 feet, the pressure on the object is 1500 lbs, so the y-intercept is 1500.
The slope is
increase in pressure
increase in depth
= 43
1 = 43.
This makes the equation y = 43x + 1500, where x is the depth in feet and
y is the pressure in pounds.

A pancake mix requires 3

the line because when there is no mix, no water is needed. The slope is

Introduction to
Functions
A relation between two sets A and B is a collection of ordered pairs, where the
ﬁrst coordinate comes from A and the second comes from B. For example, if A =
{1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {a, b, c}, one relation is the three pairs {(1, c), (1, a), (3, a)}.
A function on sets A and B is a special kind of relation where every element of A is
paired with exactly one element from B. The relation above fails to be a function
in two ways. Not every element of A is paired with an element from B, 1 and 3
are used but not 2 and 4. Also, the element 1 is used twice, not once. There are no
such restrictions on B; that is, elements from B can be paired with elements from
A many times or not at all. For example, {(1, a), (2, a), (3, b), (4, b)} is a function
from A to B.
Functions exist all around us. If a worker is paid by the hour, his weekly pay is a
function of how many hours he worked. For any number of hours worked, there is
exactly one pay amount that corresponds to that time. If A is the set of all triangles
and B is the set of real numbers, then we have a function that pairs each triangle
with exactly one real number that is its area. We will be concerned with functions

from real numbers to real numbers. A will either be all of the real numbers or will
be some part of the real numbers, and B will be the real numbers.
A linear function is one of the most basic kinds of functions. These functions
have the form f (x) = mx + b. The only difference between f (x) = mx + b and
y = mx + b is that y is replaced by f (x). Very often f (x) and y will be the same.
The letter f is the name of the function. Other common names of functions are g
and h. The notation f (x) is pronounced “f of x” or “f at x.”
Evaluating a function at a quantity means to substitute the quantity for x (or
whatever the variable is). For example, evaluating the function f (x) = 2x −5 at
6 means to substitute 6 for x.
f (6) = 2(6) −5 = 7
We might also say f (6) = 7. The quantity inside the parentheses is x and the
quantity on the right of the equal sign is y. One advantage to this notation is that
we have both the x- and y-values without having to say anything about x and y.
Functions that have no variables in them are called constant functions. All y-values
for these functions are the same.
EXAMPLES
•
Find f (−2), f (0), and f (6) for f (x) =
√
x + 3.
We need to substitute −2, 0, and 6 for x in the function.
f (−2) =

•
Find f (−8), f (π), and f (10) for f (x) = 16.
f (x) = 16 is a constant function, so the y-value is 16 no matter what quantity
is in the parentheses.
f (−8) = 16
f (π) = 16
f (10) = 16
A piecewise function is a function with two or more formulas for computing
y. The formula to use depends on where x is. There will be an interval for x
written next to each formula for y.

CHAPTER 2

In this example, there are three formulas for y: y = x −1, y = 2x, and
y = x2, and three intervals for x: x ≤−2, −2 < x < 2, and x ≥2. When
evaluating this function, we need to decide to which interval x belongs. Then
we will use the corresponding formula for y.
EXAMPLES
•
Find f (5), f (−3), and f (0) for the function above.
For f (5), does x = 5 belong to x ≤−2, −2 < x < 2, or x ≥2? Because
5 ≥2, we will use y = x2, the formula written next to x ≥2.
f (5) = 52 = 25
For f (−3), does x = −3 belong to x ≤−2, −2 < x < 2, or x ≥2?
Because −3 ≤−2, we will use y = x −1, the formula written next to
x ≤−2.
f (−3) = −3 −1 = −4
For f (0), does x = 0 belong to x ≤−2, −2 < x < 2, or x ≥2? Because
−2 < 0 < 2, we will use y = 2x, the formula written next to −2 < x < 2.
f (0) = 2(0) = 0

f (x) =

Piecewise functions come up in daily life. For example, suppose a company pays
the regular hourly wage for someone who works up to eight hours but time and a
half for someone who works more than eight hours but no more than ten hours and
double time for more than ten hours. Then a worker whose regular hourly pay is
$10 has the daily pay function below.

Very early in an introductory calculus course, students use function evaluation
to evaluate an important formula called Newton’s Quotient.
f (a + h) −f (a)
h
When evaluating Newton’s Quotient, we will be given a function such as f (x) =
x2 + 3. We need to ﬁnd f (a + h) and f (a). Once we have these two quantities,
we will put them into the quotient and simplify. Simplifying the quotient is usually
the messiest part. For f (x) = x2 + 3, we have f (a + h) = (a + h)2 + 3 =
(a + h)(a + h) + 3 = a2 + 2ah + h2 + 3, and f (a) = a2 + 3. We will substitute
a2 + 2ah + h2 + 3 for f (a + h) and a2 + 3 for f (a).

Domain and Range
The domain of a function from set A to set B is all of set A. The range is either all or
part of set B. In our example at the beginning of the chapter, we had A = {1, 2, 3, 4},
B = {a, b, c} and our function was {(1, a), (2, a), (3, b), (4, b)}. The domain of
this function is {1, 2, 3, 4}, and the range is all of the elements from B that were
paired with elements from A. These were {a, b}.
For the functions in this book, the domain will consist of all the real numbers
we are allowed to use for x. The range will be all of the y-values. In this chapter,
we will ﬁnd the domain algebraically. In Chapter 3, we will ﬁnd both the domain
and range from graphs of functions.
Very often, we ﬁnd the domain of a function by thinking about what we cannot
do. For now the things we cannot do are limited to division by zero and taking even
roots of negative numbers. If a function has x in a denominator, set the denominator
equal to zero and solve for x. The domain will not include the solution(s) to this
equation (assuming the equation has a solution). If a function has x under an even
root sign, set the quantity under the sign greater than or equal to zero to ﬁnd
the domain. Later when we learn about logarithm functions and functions from
trigonometry, we will have other things we cannot do. The domain and range are

CHAPTER 2

35
usually given in interval notation. There is a review of interval notation in the
Appendix.
EXAMPLES
•
f (x) = x2 −4
x + 3
We cannot let x + 3 to be zero, so we cannot let x = −3. The domain is
x ̸= −3, or (−∞, −3) ∪(−3, ∞).
•
f (x) =
1
x3 + 2x2 −x −2
We will use factoring by grouping to factor the denominator. (There is a
review of factoring by grouping in the Appendix.)
x3 + 2x2 −x −2 = 0
x2(x + 2) −1(x + 2) = 0
(x + 2)(x2 −1) = 0
(x + 2)(x −1)(x + 1) = 0
x + 2 = 0
x −1 = 0
x + 1 = 0
x = −2
x = 1
x = −1
The domain is all real numbers except 1, −1, and −2. The domain is shaded
on the number line in Figure 2.1.
Fig. 2.1.
The domain is (−∞, −2) ∪(−2, −1) ∪(−1, 1) ∪(1, ∞).
•
g(x) = x + 5
x2 + 1
Because x2 + 1 = 0 has no real number solution, we can let x equal any real
number. The domain is all real numbers, or (−∞, ∞).

CHAPTER 2
Introduction to Functions
36
•
f (x) =
√
x −8
Because we can only take the square root of nonnegative numbers, x−8 must
be nonnegative. We represent “x −8 must be nonnegative” as “x −8 ≥0.”
Solving x −8 ≥0, we get x ≥8. The domain is x ≥8, or [8, ∞).
•
f (x) =
√
x2 −x −2
(The Appendix has a review on solving nonlinear inequalities.) We need to
solve x2 −x −2 ≥0. Factoring x2 −x −2, we have (x −2)(x + 1).
x −2 = 0
x + 1 = 0
x = 2
x = −1
Fig. 2.2.
We will use x = −2 for the number to the left of −1, x = 0 for the number
between −1 and 2, and x = 3 for the number to the right of 2 in x2−x−2 ≥0
to see which of these numbers makes it true.
Is (−2)2 −(−2) −2 ≥0?
Yes.
Put “True” to the left of −1.
Is 02 −0 −2 ≥0?
No.
Put “False” between −1 and 2.
Is 32 −3 −2 ≥0?
Yes.
Put “True” to the right of 2.
Fig. 2.3.
The inequality is true for x ≤−1 and x ≥2, so the domain is (−∞, −1] ∪
[2, ∞).
•
f (x) =
4√
x2 + 5
Because x2 + 5 is always positive, we can let x be any real number. The
domain is (−∞, ∞).
•
g(x) =
3√x + 7

CHAPTER 2
Introduction to Functions
37
We can take the cube root of any number, so the domain is all real numbers,
or (−∞, ∞).
•
f (x) = x4 −x2 + 1
There is no x in a denominator and no x under an even root sign, so the
domain is all real numbers, or (−∞, ∞).
There are some functions that have x in a denominator and under an even
root. At times, it will be useful to shade a number line to keep track of the
domain.
•
f (x) = x2 + x −3
√
4 −x
We cannot let
√
4 −x be zero, and we cannot let 4 −x be negative. These
restrictions mean that we must have 4 −x > 0 (instead of 4 −x ≥0). The
domain is 4 > x (or x < 4), which is the interval (−∞, 4).
•
h(x) =
15 −x
x2 + 3x −4 +
√
x + 10
For
√
x + 10 we need x + 10 ≥0, or x ≥−10.
Fig. 2.4.
We also need for x2 + 3x −4 not to be zero.
x2 + 3x −4 = 0
(x + 4)(x −1) = 0
x + 4 = 0
x −1 = 0
x = −4
x = 1
We cannot let x = −4 and x = 1, so we will remove these numbers from
x ≥−10. The domain is [−10, −4) ∪(−4, 1) ∪(1, ∞).
Fig. 2.5.

CHAPTER 2

PRACTICE
For Problems 2–11, give the domain in interval notation.
1. A function consists of the ordered pairs {(h, 5), (z, 3), (i, 12)}. List the
elements in the domain.
2. f (x) = 2x + 3
x −8
3. f (x) =

√
x −9
10. f (x) = 4x3 −2x + 5
11. f (x) =
√x + 5
x2 + 2x −8
SOLUTIONS
1. The domain consists of the ﬁrst coordinate of the ordered pairs—h, z,
and i.
2. We cannot let x −8 = 0, so we cannot let x = 8. The domain is x ̸= 8, or
(−∞, 8) ∪(8, ∞).
3. We cannot let x2 −2x = x(x −2) = 0, so we cannot let x = 0 or x = 2.
The domain is all real numbers except 0 and 2, or (−∞, 0)∪(0, 2)∪(2, ∞).
4. Because x2 + 10 = 0 has no real number solution, the domain is all real
numbers, or (−∞, ∞).
5. We can take the cube root of any number, so the domain is all real numbers,
or (−∞, ∞).
6. We must have x + 3 ≥0, or x ≥−3. The domain is [−3, ∞).

CHAPTER 2
Introduction to Functions
39
7. We need to solve 4 −x2 = (2 −x)(2 + x) ≥0.
Fig. 2.6.
The domain is [−2, 2].
8. Because 3x2 +5 ≥0 is true for all real numbers, the domain is (−∞, ∞).
9. We need x −9 > 0. The domain is x > 9, or (9, ∞).
10. The domain is all real numbers, or (−∞, ∞).
11. From x + 5 ≥0, we have x ≥−5.
Fig. 2.7.
Now we need to solve x2 + 2x −8 = (x + 4)(x −2) = 0.
x + 4 = 0
x −2 = 0
x = −4
x = 2
Now we need to remove −4 and 2 from x ≥−5. The domain is [−5, −4)∪
(−4, 2) ∪(2, ∞).
Fig. 2.8.
At times the domain of a function will matter when we are solving an applied
problem. For example, suppose there is a 10′′ × 18′′ piece of cardboard that will
be made into an open-topped box. After cutting a square x by x inches from each
corner, the sides will be folded up to form the box.
Fig. 2.9.

CHAPTER 2
Introduction to Functions
40
The volume of the box is a function of x, V (x) = x(18 −2x)(10 −2x). What is
the domain of this function? We obviously cannot cut a negative number of inches
from each corner. If we cut 0 inches from each corner, we do not have a box, so x
must be positive. Finally, the box is only 10 inches wide, so we can cut up to ﬁve
inches from each corner. These facts make the domain 0 < x < 5. Maximizing the
volume of this box is a typical problem in a ﬁrst semester of calculus. The solutions
to the mathematical problem are 14±
√
61
3
(approximately 2.0635, and 7.27008).
Only one of these numbers is in the domain of the applied function, so only one of
these numbers is the solution.

CHAPTER
Functions and
Their Graphs
The graph of a function can give us a great deal of information about the
function. In this chapter we will use the graph of a function to evaluate the func-
tion, ﬁnd the x- and y-intercepts (if any), the domain and range, and determine
where the function is increasing or decreasing (an important idea in calculus).
To say that f (−3) = 1 means that the point (−3, 1) is on the graph of f (x).
If (5, 4) is a point on the graph of f (x), then f (5) = 4.
EXAMPLE
•
The graph in Figure 3.1 is the graph of f (x) = x3 −x2 −4x + 4. Find
f (−1), f (0), f (3), and f (−2).
The point (−1, 6) is on the graph means that f (−1) = 6.
The point (0, 4) is on the graph means that f (0) = 4.

43
Fig. 3.1.
The point (3, 10) is on the graph means that f (3) = 10.
The point (−2, 0) is on the graph means that f (−2) = 0.
The graph also shows the intercepts of the graph. Remember that an x-intercept
is a point where the graph touches the x-axis, and the y-intercept is a point
where the graph touches the y-axis. We can tell that the y-intercept for the graph in
Figure 3.1 is 4 (or (0, 4)) and the x-intercepts are −2, 1, and 2 (or (−2, 0), (1, 0)
and (2, 0)).
An equation “gives y as a function of x” means that for every x-value,
there is a unique y-value. From this fact we can look at a graph of an equa-
tion to decide if the equation gives y as a function of x. If an x-value has
more than one y-value in the equation, then there will be more than one point
on the graph that has the same x-coordinate. A line through points that have
the same x-coordinate is vertical. This is the idea behind the Vertical Line
Test. The graph of an equation passes the Vertical Line Test if every vertical
line touches the graph at one point or not at all. If so, then the equation is
a function.
The graph of y2 = x is shown in Figure 3.2. The vertical line x = 4 touches the
graph in two places, (4, 2) and (4, −2), so y is not a function of x in the equation
y2 = x.
Thedomainofafunctionconsistsofallpossiblex-values. Wecanﬁndthedomain
of a function by looking at its graph. The graph’s extension horizontally shows the
function’s domain. The range of a function consists of all possible y-values. The
graph’s vertical extention shows the function’s range.

Fig. 3.2.
EXAMPLES
Give the domain and range in interval notation.
•
Fig. 3.3.
The graph extends horizontally from x = −5 to x = 4. Because there are
closed dots on these endpoints (instead of open dots), x = −5 and x = 4 are
part of the domain, too. The domain is [−5, 4]. The graph extends vertically
from y = −4 to y = 3. The range is [−4, 3].

CHAPTER 3
Functions and Their Graphs
45
•
Fig. 3.4.
The graph extends horizontally from x = −3 to x = 2. Because open dots
are used on (−3, 5) and (2, 0), these points are not on the graph, so x = −3
and x = 2 are not part of the domain. The domain is (−3, 2). The graph
extends vertically from y = −4 and y = 5. The range is [−4, 5). We need
to use a bracket around −4 because (0, −4) is a point on the graph, and a
parenthesis around 5 because the point (−3, 5) is not a point on the graph.
•
Fig. 3.5.
The graph extends horizontally from x = −2 on the left and vertically from
below y = 0. The domain is [−2, ∞), and the range is (−∞, 0].
A function is increasing on an interval if moving toward the right in the inter-
val means the graph is going up. A function is decreasing on an interval if moving

CHAPTER 3
Functions and Their Graphs
46
toward the right in the interval means the graph is going down. The function whose
graph is in Figure 3.6 is increasing from x = −3 to x = 0 as well as to the right of
x = 2. It is decreasing to the left of x = −3 and between x = 0 and x = 2. Using
interval notation, we say the function is increasing on the intervals (−3, 0) and
(2, ∞) and decreasing on the intervals (−∞, −3) and (0, 2). For reasons covered
in calculus, parentheses are used for the interval notation.
Fig. 3.6.
A function is constant on an interval if the y-values do not change. This part of
the graph will be part of a horizontal line.
EXAMPLES
Determine the intervals on which the functions are increasing, decreasing or
constant.
•

This function is increasing on (−5, −2) and (4, 5). It is decreasing on (−2, 2)
and constant on (2, 4).

Graphs are useful tools to present a lot of information in a small space. Being
able to read a graph and draw conclusions from it are important in many subjects
in addition to mathematics. In the example below, we will practice drawing con-
clusions based on information given in the graph in Figure 3.12. This graph shows
the daily balance of a checking account for about two weeks. No more than one
transaction (a deposit or a check written) is made in one day. For example, the
balance at the end of the second day is $350 and $300 at the end of the third day,
so a $50 check was written on the third day.
1.
On what day was a check for $200 written?
On the 12th day when the balance dropped from $150 to −$50.
2.
What is the largest deposit?
The largest increase was $200, on the 8th day when the balance increased
from $200 to $400.
3.
What is the largest check written?
The largest check was written on the tenth day when the balance dropped

Average Rate of Change
Calculus deals with the rate of change. A familiar example of a rate of change is
speed (or more accurately, velocity). Velocity is the rate of change of distance per
unit of time. Acar traveling in city trafﬁc will generally have a lower rate of change
of distance per hour than a car traveling on an interstate freeway. A glass of water
placed in a refrigerator will have a lower rate of temperature change than a glass of
water placed in a freezer. In calculus, you will study instantaneous rates of change
of functions at different values of x. We will study the average rate of change in
this book. As you will see in the following examples, the average rate of change
can hide a lot of variation.

Even and Odd Functions
A graph is symmetric if one half looks like the other half. We might also say that
one half of the graph is a reﬂection of the other.
When a graph has symmetry, we usually say that it is symmetric with respect to
a line or a point. The graph in Figure 3.15 is symmetric with respect to the x-axis
because the half of the graph above the x-axis is a reﬂection of the half below the
x-axis. The graph in Figure 3.16 is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.
Fig. 3.15.

CHAPTER 3
Functions and Their Graphs
56
Fig. 3.16.
Fig. 3.17.
The graph in Figure 3.17 is symmetric with respect to the vertical line x = 2.
One type of symmetry that is a little harder to see is origin symmetry. A graph
has origin symmetry if folding the graph along the x-axis then again along the
y-axis would have one part of the graph coincide with the other part. The graphs
in Figures 3.18 and 3.19 have origin symmetry.
Knowing in advance whether or not the graph of a function is symmetric can
make sketching the graph less work. We can use algebra to decide if the graph
of a function has y-axis symmetry or origin symmetry. Except for the function
f (x) = 0, the graph of a function will not have x-axis symmetry because x-axis
symmetry would cause a graph to fail the Vertical Line Test.
For the graph of a function to be symmetric with respect to the y-axis, a point
on the left side of the y-axis will have a mirror image on the right side of the
graph.
The graph of a function with y-axis symmetry has the property that (x, y) is
on the graph means that (−x, y) is also on the graph. The functional notation for
this idea is f (x) = f (−x). “f (x) = f (−x)” says that the y value for x (f (x))

is the same as the y-value for −x (f (−x)). If evaluating a function at −x does
not change the equation, then its graph will have y-axis symmetry. Such functions
are called even functions.
For a function whose graph is symmetric with respect to the origin, the mirror
image of (x, y) is (−x, −y).
Fig. 3.21.
The functional notation for this idea is f (−x)
=
−f (x). “f (−x)
=
−f (x)” says that the y-value for −x (f (−x)) is the opposite of the y-value for
x (−f (x)). If evaluating a function at −x changes the equation to its negative,
then the graph of the function will be symmetric with respect to the origin. These
functions are called odd functions.
In order to work the following problems, we will need the following facts.
a(−x)even power = axeven power
and
a(−x)odd power = −axodd power
EXAMPLES
Determine if the given function is even (its graph is symmetric with respect to
the y-axis), odd (its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin), or neither.
•
f (x) = x2 −2
Does evaluating f (x) at −x change the function? If so, is f (−x) =
−(x2 −2) = −f (x)?
f (−x) = (−x)2 −2 = x2 −2
Evaluating f (x) at −x does not change the function, so the function
is even.

CHAPTER 3

59
•
f (x) = x3 + 5x
Does evaluating f (x) at −x change the function? If so, is f (−x) =
−(x3 + 5x) = −f (x)?
f (−x) = (−x)3 + 5(−x) = −x3 −5x = −(x3 + 5x) = −f (x)
Evaluating f (x) at −x gives us −f (x), so the function is odd.
•
f (x) =
x
x + 1
Does evaluating f (x) at −x change the function? If so, is f (−x) = −x
x+1 =
−f (x)?
f (−x) =
−x
−x + 1
Because f (−x) is not the same as f (x) nor the same as −f (x), the
function is neither even nor odd.
PRACTICE
For 1–4, determine whether or not the graph has symmetry. If it does, determine
the kind of symmetry it has. For 5–8, determine if the functions are even, odd, or
neither.

Combinations of

Functions
Most of the functions studied in calculus are some combination of only a few
families of functions, most of the combinations are arithmetic. We can add two
functions, f + g(x), subtract them, f −g(x), multiply them, fg(x), and divide
them f
g (x). The domain of f + g(x), f −g(x), and fg(x), is the intersection of
the domain of f (x) and g(x). In other words, their domain is where the domain
of f (x) overlaps the domain of g(x). The domain of f
g (x) is the same, except we
need to remove any x that makes g(x) = 0.

An important combination of two functions is function composition. This
involves evaluating one function at the other. The notation for composing f with
g is f ◦g(x). By deﬁnition, f ◦g(x) = f (g(x)), this means that we substitute
g(x) for x in f (x).

At times, we only need to ﬁnd f ◦g(x) for a particular value of x. The
y-value for g(x) becomes the x-value for f (x).
EXAMPLE
•
Find f ◦g(−1), f ◦g(0), and g◦f (1) for f (x) = 4x +3 and g(x) = 2−x2.

We can compose two functions at a single x-value by looking at the graphs
of the individual functions. To ﬁnd f ◦g(a), we will look at the graph of
g(x) to ﬁnd the point whose x-coordinate is a. The y-coordinate of this
point will be g(a). Then we will look at the graph of f (x) to ﬁnd the
point whose x-coordinate is g(a). The y-coordinate of this point will be
f (g(a)) = f ◦g(a).
EXAMPLE
Refer to Figure 4.1. The solid graph is the graph of f (x), and the dashed graph is
the graph of g(x).

(−2, 0) is on the graph of f (x), so f (−2) = 0.

CHAPTER 4
Combinations of Functions
69
f ◦g(3) = f (g(3))
Look for x = 3 on g(x).
= f (−2)
(3, −2) is on the graph of g(x), so g(3) = −2.

(−2, 0) is on the graph of f (x), so f (−2) = 0.

Look for x = 5 on g(x).
= f (0)
(5, 0) is on the graph of g(x), so g(5) = 0.

(0, −1) is on the graph of f (x), so f (0) = −1.
g ◦f (0) = g(f (0))
Look for x = 0 on f (x).
= g(−1)
(0, −1) is on the graph of f (x), so f (0) = −1.
= −2
(−1, −2) is on the graph of g(x), so g(−1) = −2.
Unfortunately, ﬁnding the domain for the composition of two functions is not
straightforward. The deﬁnition for the domain of f ◦g(x) is the set of all real
numbers x such that g(x) is in the domain of f (x). When ﬁnding the domain
for f ◦g(x), begin with the domain with g(x). Then remove any x-value whose
y-value is not in the domain for f (x). For example if f (x) = 1
x g(x) = x + 3, the
y-values for g(x) are x + 3. We need for x + 3 to be nonzero for f ◦g(x) =
1
x+3.

zero. A fraction equals zero only when the numerator is zero, so we cannot
allow x −1 to be zero. We must remove x = 1 from the domain of g(x).

CHAPTER 4

The domain of f ◦g(x) is x ̸= −1, 1, or (−∞, −1) ∪(−1, 1) ∪(1, ∞).
This function simpliﬁes to f ◦g(x) = x+1
x−1, which hides the fact that we
cannot let x = −1.
Any number of functions can be composed together. Functions can even be
composed with themselves. When composing three or more functions together,
we will work from the right to the left, performing one composition at a time.
EXAMPLES
Find f ◦f (x) and f ◦g ◦h(x).
•
f (x) = x3, g(x) = 2x −5, and h(x) = x2 + 1.
f ◦f (x) = f (f (x)) = f (x3) = (x3)3 = x9
For f ◦g ◦h(x), we will begin with g ◦h(x) = g(h(x)) = g(x2 + 1) =
2(x2 + 1) −5 = 2x2 −3. Now we need to evaluate f (x) at 2x2 −3.
f ◦g ◦h(x) = f (g(h(x))
= f (2x2 −3) = (2x2 −3)3
•
f (x) = 3x + 7, g(x) = |x −2|, and h(x) = x4 −5
f ◦f (x) = f (f (x)) = f (3x + 7) = 3(3x + 7) + 7 = 9x + 28
f ◦g ◦h(x) = f ◦g(h(x))
g(h(x)) = g(x4 −5) = |(x4 −5) −2| = |x4 −7|
f ◦g(h(x)) = f (g(h(x))) = f (|x4 −7|)
= 3|x4 −7| + 7
In order for calculus students to use some formulas, they need to recognize
complicated functions as a combination of simpler functions. Sums, differences,
products, and quotients are easy to see, but some compositions of functions are
less obvious.
EXAMPLES
Find functions f (x) and g(x) so that h(x) = f ◦g(x).
•
h(x) =
√
x + 16

CHAPTER 4
Combinations of Functions
71
Although there are many possibilities for f (x) and g(x), there is usually one
pair of functions that is obvious. Usually we want g(x) to be the computation
that is done ﬁrst and f (x), the computation to be done last. Here, when
computing the y-value for h(x), we would calculate x + 16. This will be
g(x). The last calculation will be to take the square root. This will be f (x).
If we let f (x) = √x and g(x) = x + 16, we have f ◦g(x) = f (g(x)) =
f (x + 16) =
√
x + 16 = h(x).
•
h(x) =
2
x2+1
When computing a y-value for h(x), we would ﬁrst ﬁnd x2 + 1. This will
be g(x). This number will be the denominator of a fraction whose numer-
ator is 2. This will be f (x), a fraction whose numerator is 2 and whose
denominator is x. If f (x) = 2
x and g(x) = x2 + 1,
f ◦g(x) = f (g(x)) = f (x2 + 1) =
2
x2 + 1 = h(x).

Inverse Functions
In the same way operations on real numbers (like addition and multiplication)
have identities and inverses, operations on functions can have identities and
inverses. We can apply many operations on functions that we can apply to real
numbers—adding, multiplying, raising to powers, etc. These operations can have
identities and functions have inverses in the same way they do with real numbers.
The additive identity for function addition is i(x) = 0. Each function has an addi-
tive inverse, −f (x) is the additive inverse for f (x). The multiplicative identity for
function multiplication is i(x) = 1, and the multiplicative inverse for f (x) is
1
f (x).
If we look at function composition as an operation on functions, then we can
ask whether or not there is an identity for this operation and whether or not func-
tions have inverses for this operation. There is an identity for this operation,
i(x) = x. For any function f (x), f ◦i(x) = f (i(x)) = f (x). Some functions
have inverses. Later we will see which functions have inverses and how to ﬁnd
inverses. The notation for the inverse function of f (x) is f −1(x). This is different
from (f (x))−1, which is the multiplicative inverse for f (x). For now, we will be
given two functions that are said to be inverses of each other. We will use function
composition to verify that they are.

If we think of a function as a collection of points on a graph, or ordered
pairs, then the only thing that makes f (x) different from f −1(x) is that their
x-coordinates and y-coordinates are reversed. For example, if (3, −1) is a point on
the graph of f (x), then (−1, 3) is a point on the graph of f −1(x).
EXAMPLE
The graph of a function f (x) is given in Figure 4.3. Use the graph of f (x) to
sketch the graph of f −1(x).

If f (x) is a function that has an inverse, then the graph of f −1(x) is a reﬂection
of the graph of f (x) across the line y = x.
Fig. 4.5.
Fig. 4.6.
A function has an inverse if its graph passes the Horizontal Line Test—if any
horizontal line touches the graph in more than one place, then the function will
not have an inverse. Functions whose graphs pass the Horizontal Line Test are
called one-to-one functions. For a one-to-one function, every x will be paired with
exactly one y and every y will be paired with exactly one x.

EXAMPLE
•
The graph of f (x) is given in Figure 4.7. Is f (x) one to one?
Fig. 4.7.
This graph fails the Horizontal Line Test, so f (x) is not one to one.
Fig. 4.8.
For functions that are not one to one, we can restrict the domain to force the
function to be one to one. The function whose graph is in Figure 4.9, f (x) = x2−3,
is not one to one. If we restrict the domain to x ≥0, then the new function is one
to one.
Finding the inverse function is not hard, but it can be a little tedious. The steps
below show the process of algebraically switching x and y.
1.
Replace f (x) with x, and replace x with y.

Solve this equation for y.

Calculus students work with only a few families of functions—absolute value,
nth root, cubic, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and
trigonometric functions. Two or more of these functions might be combined arith-
metically or by using function composition. In this chapter, we will look at the
absolute value function (whose graph is in Figure 5.1), the square root func-
tion (whose graph is in Figure 5.2), and the cubic function (whose graph is in
Figure 5.3).
We will also look at how these functions are affected by some simple changes.
Knowing the effects certain changes have on a function will make sketching its
graph by hand much easier. This understanding will also help you to use a graphing
calculator. One of the simplest changes to a function is to add a number. This change
will cause the graph to shift vertically or horizontally.

What effect does adding 1 to a function have on its graph? It depends on where
we put “+1.” Adding 1 to x will shift the graph left one unit. Adding 1 to y will
shift the graph up one unit.
•
y = |x+1|, 1 is added to x, shifting the graph to the left 1 unit. See Figure 5.4.
•
y = |x| + 1, 1 is added to y (which is |x|) shifting the graph up 1 unit. See
Figure 5.5.

For the graphs in this chapter, the solid graph will be the graph of the orig-
inal function,
and the dashed graph will be the graph of the transformed
function.

x + 2, 2 is added to x, shifting the graph to the left 2 units.

y = √x + 2, 2 is added to y (which is √x) shifting the graph up 2 units.

Subtracting a number from x will shift the graph to the right while subtracting
a number from y will shift the graph down.
•
y = (x −1)3, 1 is subtracted from x, shifting the graph to the right 1 unit.
See Figure 5.8.
•
y = x3 −1, 1 is subtracted from y (which is x3), shifting the graph down 1
unit. See Figure 5.9.
Fig. 5.8.
Fig. 5.9.
Multiplying the x-values or y-values by a number changes the graph, usually by
stretching or compressing it. Multiplying the x-values or y-values by −1 will
reverse the graph. If a is a number larger than 1 (a > 1), then multiplying x by a
will horizontally compress the graph, but multiplying y by a will vertically stretch
the graph. If a is positive but less than 1 (0 < a < 1), then multiplying x by a will
horizontally stretch the graph, but multiplying y by a will vertically compress the
graph.
•
y =
√
2x, the graph is horizontally compressed. See Figure 5.10.
•
y = 2√x, the graph is vertically stretched. See Figure 5.11.
•

For many functions, but not all, vertical compression is the same as horizontal
stretching, and vertical stretching is the same as horizontal compression.
Multiplying the x-values by −1 will reverse the graph horizontally. This is
called reﬂecting the graph across the y-axis. Multiplying the y-values by −1
will reverse the graph vertically. This is called reﬂecting the graph across the
x-axis.

Fig. 5.15.
When a function is even, reﬂecting the graph across the y-axis does not change the
graph. When a function is odd, reﬂecting the graph across the y-axis is the same as
reﬂecting it across the x-axis.
We can use function notation to summarize these transformations.
y = af (x + h) + k
•
If h is positive, the graph is shifted to the left h units.
•
If h is negative, the graph is shifted to the right h units.
•
If k is positive, the graph is shifted up k units.
•
If k is negative, the graph is shifted down k units.

•
If a > 1, the graph is vertically stretched. The larger a is, the greater the
stretch.
•
If 0 < a < 1, the graph is vertically compressed. The closer to 0 a is, the
greater the compression.
•
The graph of −f (x) is reﬂected across the x-axis.

The graph of f (−x) is reﬂected across the y-axis.
The graphs below are various transformations of the graph of y = |x|.

CHAPTER
Quadratic
Functions
The graph of every quadratic function, f (x) = ax2 + bx + c, is a transformation
of the graph of y = x2. (See Figure 6.1.)
When the function is written in the form f (x) = a(x −h)2 +k, we have a pretty
good idea of what its graph looks like: h will cause the graph to shift horizontally,
and k will cause it to shift vertically. The point (0, 0) on y = x2 has shifted to
(h, k). This point is the vertex. On a parabola that opens up (when a is positive),
the vertex is the lowest point on the graph. The vertex is the highest point on a
parabola that opens down (when a is negative).
We need to know the vertex when sketching a parabola. Once we have the vertex,
we will ﬁnd two points to its left and two points to its right. We should choose points
in such a way that shows the curvature around the vertex and how fast the ends are
going up or down. It does not matter which points we choose, but a good rule of
thumb is to ﬁnd h −2a, h −a, h + a, and h + 2a. Because a parabola is symmetric

about the line x = h (the vertical line that goes through the vertex), the y-values
for h −a and h + a will be the same and the y-values for h −2a and h + 2a will
be the same, too. We will also ﬁnd the intercepts.
EXAMPLES
Sketch the graph for the following quadratic functions. Find the y-intercept and the
x-intercepts, if any.
•
f (x) = (x −1)2 −4
a = 1, h = 1, k = −4 The parabola opens up and the vertex is (1, −4).
For the y-intercept, let x = 0 in the function. The y-intercept is (0−1)2−4 =
−3. For the x-intercepts, let y = 0 and solve for x.
(x −1)2 −4 = 0
(x −1)2 = 4
Take the square root of each side.

CHAPTER 6
Quadratic Functions

Fig. 6.4.
By knowing the vertex and one other point on the graph, we can ﬁnd an
equation for the quadratic function. Once we know the vertex, we have h
and k in y = a(x −h)2 + k. By using another point (x, y), we can ﬁnd a.
EXAMPLE
•
The vertex for a quadratic function is (−3, 4), and the y-intercept is −10.
Find an equation for this function.
Let h = −3, k = 4 in y = a(x −h)2 + k to get y = a(x + 3)2 + 4. Saying
that the y-intercept is −10 is another way of saying (0, −10) is a point on
the graph. We can let x = 0 and y = −10 in y = a(x + 3)2 + 4 to ﬁnd a.
−10 = a(0 + 3)2 + 4
−14 = 9a
−14
9 = a
One equation for this function is y = −14
9 (x + 3)2 + 4.
Quadratic equations are not normally written in the convenient form f (x) =
a(x −h)2 + k. We can complete the square on f (x) = ax2 + bx + c to ﬁnd (h, k).
Begin by completing the square on the x2 and x terms.

The vertex is (3, −11).
•
f (x) = 4x2 + 8x + 1
We will begin by factoring a = 4 from 4x2 + 8x. Then we will complete the
square on the x2 and x terms.
f (x) = 4x2 + 8x + 1
f (x) = 4(x2 + 2x) + 1
f (x) = 4(x2 + 2x + 1) + 1+?
By putting +1 in the parentheses, we are adding 4(1) = 4. We need to
balance this by adding −4 to 1.
f (x) = 4(x2 + 2x + 1) + 1 + (−4)
f (x) = 4(x + 1)2 −3
The vertex is (−1, −3).
When factoring an unusual quantity from two or more terms, it is not obvi-
ous what terms go in the parentheses. We can ﬁnd the terms that go in the
parentheses by writing the terms to be factored as numerators of fractions
and the number to be factored as the denominator. The terms that go in the
parentheses are the simpliﬁed fractions.

One advantage to the form f (x) = ax2 + bx + c is that it is usually easier to use
to ﬁnd the intercepts. We can use factoring and the quadratic formula when it is in
this form. Also, c is the y-intercept. Because a is the same number in both forms,
we can tell whether the parabola opens up or down when the equation is in either
form. It can be tedious to complete the square on f (x) = ax2 + bx + c to ﬁnd
the vertex. Fortunately, there is a shortcut.
h = −b

and
k = f

An important topic in calculus is optimizing functions; that is, ﬁnding a maxi-
mum and/or minimum value for the function. Precalculus students can use algebra
to optimize quadratic functions. A quadratic function has a minimum value (if its
graph opens up) or a maximum value (if its graph opens down). If a is positive,
then k is the minimum functional value. If a is negative, then k is the maximum
functional value. These values occur at x = h.
EXAMPLES
Find the minimum or maximum functional value and where it occurs.
•
f (x) = −(x −3)2 + 25
The parabola opens down because a = −1 is negative. This means that
k = 25 is the maximum functional value. It occurs at x = 3.
•
y = 0.01x2 −6x + 2000
h = −b
2a = −(−6)
2(0.01) = 300 and k = 0.01(300)2 −6(300) + 2000 = 1100
a = 0.01 is positive, so k = 1100 is the minimum functional value. The
minimum occurs at x = 300.

For Problems 1–3, sketch the graph and identify the vertex and intercepts.

completing the square.

3(0 + 1) + 2 = 8
3. There are two
ways we can tell that there are no x-intercepts. The parabola opens up and
the vertex is above the x-axis, so the parabola is always above the x-axis.
Also, the equation 2

These techniques to maximize/minimize quadratic functions can be applied to prob-
lems outside of mathematics. We can maximize the enclosed area, minimize the
surface area of a box, maximize revenue, and optimize many other problems. In the
ﬁrst group of problems, the functions to be optimized will be given. In the second,
we will have to ﬁnd the functions based on the information given in the problem.
The answers to every problem below will be one or both coordinates of the vertex.
EXAMPLES
•
The weekly proﬁt function for a product is given by P(x) = −0.0001x2 +
3x −12,500, where x is the number of units produced per week, and P(x) is
the proﬁt (in dollars). What is the maximum weekly proﬁt? How many units
should be produced for this proﬁt?
The proﬁt function is a quadratic function which has a maximum value.
What information does the vertex give us? h is the number of units needed
to maximize the weekly proﬁt, and k is the maximum weekly proﬁt.
h = −b
2a =

2(−0.0001) = 15,000 and
k = −0.0001(15,000)2 + 3(15,000) −12,500 = 10,000
Maximize the weekly proﬁt by producing 15,000 units. The maximum
weekly proﬁt is $10,000.
•
The number of units of a product sold depends on the amount of money spent
on advertising. If y = −26x2 + 2600x + 10,000 gives the number of units
sold after x thousands of dollars is spent on advertising, ﬁnd the amount
spent on advertising that results in the most sales.
h will give us the amount to spend on advertising in order to maximize sales,
and k will tell us the maximum sales level. We only need to ﬁnd h.
h = −b
2a = −2600
2(−26) = 50
$50 thousand should be spent on advertising to maximize sales.
The height of an object propelled upward (neglecting air resistance) is given by
the quadratic function s(t) = −16t2 + v0t + s0 , where s is the height in feet, and

CHAPTER 6
Quadratic Functions
117
t is the number of seconds after the initial thrust. The initial velocity (in feet per
second) of the object is v0, and s0 is the initial height (in feet) of the object. For
example, if an object is tossed up at the rate of 10 feet per second, then v0 = 10.
If an object is propelled upward from a height of 50 feet, then s0 = 50. If an
object is dropped, its initial velocity is 0, so v0 = 0.
EXAMPLES
•
An object is tossed upward with an initial velocity of 15 feet per second from
a height of four feet. What is the object’s maximum height? How long does
it take the object to reach its maximum height?
Because the initial velocity is 15 feet per second, v0 = 15, and the initial
height is four feet, so s0 = 4. The function that gives the height of the object
(in feet) after t seconds is s(t) = −16t2 + 15t + 4.
h = −b
2a =
−15
2(−16) = 0.46875 and
k = −16(0.46875)2 + 15(0.46875) + 4 = 7.515625
The
object
reaches
its
maximum
height
of
7.515625
feet
after
0.46875 seconds.
•
A projectile is ﬁred from the ground with an initial velocity of 120 miles per
hour. What is the projectile’s maximum height? How long does it take to
reach its maximum height?
Because the projectile is being ﬁred from the ground, its initial height is 0,
so s0 = 0. The initial velocity is given as 120 miles per hour—we need to
convert this to feet per second. There are 5280 feet per mile, so 120 miles is
120(5280) = 633,600 feet. There are 60(60) = 3600 seconds per hour.
120 miles
1 hour
= 633,600 feet
3600 seconds = 176 feet per second
Now we have the function: s(t) = −16t2 + 176t + 0 = −16t2 + 176t.
h = −b
2a = −176
2(−16) = 5.5 and k = −16(5.5)2 + 176(5.5) = 484
The projectile reaches its maximum height of 484 feet after 5.5 seconds.
Another problem involving the maximum vertical height is one where we know
the horizontal distance traveled instead of the time it has traveled. The x-coordinates
describe the object’s horizontal distance, and the y-coordinates describe its height.
Here we will ﬁnd the maximum height and how far it traveled horizontally to reach
the maximum height.

CHAPTER 6

EXAMPLE
•
A ball is thrown across a ﬁeld. Its path can be described by the equation
y = −0.002x2 + 0.2x + 5, where x is the horizontal distance (in feet) and
y is the height (in feet). See Figure 6.8. What is the ball’s maximum height?
How far had it traveled horizontally to reach its maximum height?
Fig. 6.8.
k will answer the ﬁrst question, and h will answer the second.
h = −b
2a =
−0.2
2(−0.002) = 50 and k = −0.002(50)2 + 0.2(50) + 5 = 10
The ball reached a maximum height of 10 feet when it traveled 50 feet
horizontally.
The revenue of a product or service can depend on its price in two ways. An
increase in the price means that more revenue per unit is earned but fewer units are
sold. A decrease in the price means that less revenue is earned per unit but more
units are sold. Quadratic functions model some of these relationships. In the next
problems, a current price and sales level are given. We will be told how a price
increase or decrease affects the sales level. We will let x represent the number of
price increases/decreases. Suppose every $10 decrease in the price results in an
increase of ﬁve customers. Then the revenue function is (old price −10x)(old sales
level + 5x). If every $50 increase in the price results in a loss of one customer, then
the revenue function is (old price + 50x)(old sales level −1x). These functions are
quadratic functions which have a maximum value. The vertex tells us the maximum
revenue and how many times to decrease/increase the price to get the maximum
revenue.
EXAMPLES
•
A management ﬁrm has determined that 60 apartments in a complex can
be rented if the monthly rent is $900, and that for each $50 increase

CHAPTER 6
Quadratic Functions
119
in the rent, three tenants are lost with little chance of being replaced.
What rent should be charged to maximize revenue? What is the maximum
revenue?
Let x represent the number of $50 increases in the rent. This means if the
rent is raised $50, x = 1, if the rent is increased $100, x = 2, and if the rent
is increased $150, x = 3. The rent function is 900 + 50x. The number of
tenants depends on the number of $50 increases in the rent. So, if the rent
is raised $50, there will be 60 −3(1) tenants; if the rent is raised $100, the
there will be 60 −3(2) tenants; and if the rent is raised $150, there will be
60 −3(3) tenants. If the rent is raised $50x, there will be 60 −3x tenants.
The revenue function is
R = (900 + 50x)(60 −3x) = −150x2 + 300x + 54,000.
h = −b
2a =
−300
2(−150) = 1 and k = −150(1)2 + 300(1) + 54,000 = 54,150
The maximum revenue is $54,150. Maximize revenue by charging 900 +
50(1) = $950 per month for rent.
•
A cinema multiplex averages 2500 tickets sold on a Saturday when ticket
prices are $8. Concession revenue averages $1.50 per ticket sold. A research
ﬁrm has determined that for each $0.50 increase in the ticket price, 100 fewer
tickets will be sold. What is the maximum revenue (including concession
revenue) and what ticket price maximizes the revenue?
Let x represent the number of $0.50 increases in the price. The ticket price is
8 + 0.50x. The average number of tickets sold is 2500 −100x. The average
ticket revenue is (8.00 + 0.50x)(2500 −100x). The average concession
revenue is 1.50(2500 −100x). The total revenue is
R = (8.00 + 0.50x)(2500 −100x) + 1.50(2500 −100x)
= −50x2 + 300x + 23,750.
h = −b
2a = −300
2(−50) = 3 and k = −50(3)2 + 300(3) + 23,750 = 24,200
To maximize revenue, the ticket price should be 8.00 + 0.50(3) = $9.50,
and the maximum revenue is $24,200.
•
The manager of a performing arts company offers a group discount price of
$45 per person for groups of 20 or more and will drop the price by $1.50 per
person for each additional person. What is the maximum revenue? What size
group will maximize the revenue?

CHAPTER 6
Quadratic Functions
120
Because the price does not change until more than 20 people are in the group,
we will let x represent the additional people in the group. What is the price
per person if the group size is more than 20? If one extra person is in the
group, the price is 45 −1(1.50). If there are two extra people, the price is
45 −2(1.50); and if there are three extra people, the price is 45 −3(1.50).
So, if there are x additional people, the price is 45 −1.50x. The revenue is
R = (20 + x)(45 −1.50x) = −1.50x2 + 15x + 900.
h = −b
2a =
−15
2(−1.50) = 5 and k = −1.50(5)2 + 15(5) + 900 = 937.50
The group size that maximizes revenue is 20 + 5 = 25. The maximum
revenue is $937.50.
Optimizing geometric ﬁgures are common calculus and precalculus problems.
In many of these problems, there are more than two variables. We will be given
enough information in the problem to eliminate one of the variables. For example,
if we want the area of a rectangle, the formula is A = LW. If we know the perimeter
is 20, then we can use the equation 2L + 2W = 20 to solve for either L or W and
substitute this quantity in the area function, reducing the equation from three to
two variables. The new area function will be quadratic.
EXAMPLES
•
A parks department has 1200 meters of fencing available to enclose two
adjacent playing ﬁelds. (See Figure 6.9.) What dimensions will maximize
the enclosed area? What is the maximum enclosed area?
Fig. 6.9.
The total enclosed area is A = LW. Because there is 1200 meters of fencing
available, we must have L + W + W + W + L = 1200 (see Figure 6.10).

CHAPTER 6
Quadratic Functions
121
Fig. 6.10.
We can solve for L or W in this equation and substitute it in A = LW,
reducing the equation to two variables. We will solve for L in 2L + 3W =
1200.
2L + 3W = 1200
L = 1200 −3W

2(−3/2) = 200 and k = −3

The width that maximizes the enclosed area is 200 meters, the length is
1200−3(200)
2
= 300 meters. The maximum enclosed area is 60,000 square
meters.
Another common fencing problem is one where only three sides of a rectangular
area needs to be fenced. The fourth side is some other boundary like a stream or the
side of a building. We will call two sides W and the third side L. Then “2W + L =
amount of fencing” allows us to solve for L and substitute “L = amount of fencing
−2W” in A = LW to reduce the area formula to two variables.
EXAMPLE
•
A farmer has 1000 feet of fencing materials available to fence a rectangular
pasture next to a river. If the side along the river does not need to be fenced,
what dimensions will maximize the enclosed area? What is the maximum
enclosed area?

CHAPTER 6
Quadratic Functions
122
Fig. 6.11.
Using the fact that 2W + L = 1000, we can solve for L and substitute this
quantity in the area formula A = LW.
2W + L = 1000
L = 1000 −2W
A = LW
A = (1000 −2W)W = −2W 2 + 1000W
This quadratic function has a maximum value.
h = −b
2a = −1000
2(−2) = 250 and k = −2(250)2 + 1000(250) = 125,000
Maximize the enclosed area by letting W = 250 feet and L = 1000 −
2(250) = 500 feet. The maximum enclosed area is 125,000 square feet.
In the last problems, we will maximize the area of a ﬁgure but will have to work
a little harder to ﬁnd the area function to maximize.
EXAMPLES
•
A window is to be constructed in the shape of a rectangle surmounted by a
semicircle (see Figure 6.12). The perimeter of the window needs to be 18
feet. What dimensions will admit the greatest amount of light?
The dimensions that will admit the greatest amount of light are the same
that will maximize the area of the window. The area of the window is the
rectangular area plus the area of the semicircle. The area of the rectangular
region is LW. Because the width of the window is the diameter (or twice the

CHAPTER 6

123
Fig. 6.12.
radius) of the semicircle, we can rewrite the area as L(2r) = 2rL. The area
of the semicircle is half of the area of a circle with radius r, or 1
2πr2. The
total area of the window is
A = 2rL + 1
2πr2.
Now we will use the fact that the perimeter is 18 feet to help us replace L
with an expression using r. The perimeter is made up of the two sides (2L)
and the bottom of the rectangle (2r) and the length around the semicircle.
The length around the outside of the semicircle is half of the circumference
of a circle with radius r, 1
2(2πr) = πr. The total perimeter is P = 2L +
2r + πr. This is equal to 18. We will solve the equation 2L + 2r + πr = 18
for L.
2L + 2r + πr = 18
2L = 18 −2r −πr
L = 18 −2r −πr

= 9 −r −1

Now we will substitute 9 −r −1

A track is to be constructed so that it is shaped like Figure 6.13, a rectangle
with a semicircle at each end. If the inside perimeter of the track is to be 1

mile, what is the maximum area of the rectangle?
Fig. 6.13.
The length of the rectangle is L. Its width is the diameter of the semicircles
(or twice their radius). The area formula for the rectangle is A = LW =
L(2r) = 2rL. The perimeter of the ﬁgure is the two sides of the rectangle
(2L) plus the length around each semicircle (πr). The total perimeter is
2L + 2πr. Although we could work with the dimensions in miles, it will be
easier to convert 1/4 mile to feet. There are 5280/4 = 1320 feet in 1/4 mile.

The coordinates of the corners will help us to see how we can ﬁnd the length

The height of the rectangle is y and the width is x. This makes the area
A = xy. We need to eliminate x or y. Because y = −2x + 12, we can

k = −16(4.95)2 + 158.4(4.95) + 10 = 402.04
The projectile reaches a maximum height of 402.04 feet after 4.95 seconds.
4. We will let x represent the number of $0.25 decreases in the ticket price.
The ticket price is 12 −0.25x and the average number attending the games
is 1000 + 25x. Ticket revenue is (12 −0.25x)(1000 + 25x). Revenue from
concession sales is 2(1000 + 25x). Total revenue is
R = (12 −0.25x)(1000 + 25x) + 2(1000 + 25x)
= −6.25x2 + 100x + 14,000

2a =

2(−6.25) = 8 and
k = −6.25(8)2 + 100(8) + 14,000 = 14,400
The ticket price that will maximize revenue is 12 −0.25(8) = $10 and the
maximum revenue is $14,400.
5. The total area is A = LW. Because there is 1600 feet of fencing available,
2L + 4W = 1600. Solving this equation for L, we have L = 800 −2W.
Substitute 800 −2W for L in A = LW.
A = LW
= (800 −2W)W = −2W 2 + 800W
h = −b
2a = −800
2(−2) = 200
Maximize the enclosed area by letting the width be 200 feet and the length
be 800 −2(200) = 400 feet.
6. The enclosed area is A = LW. Because 900 feet of fencing is available,
2W + L = 900. Solving this for L, we have L = 900 −2W. We will
substitute 900 −2W for L in A = LW.
A = LW
= (900 −2W)W = −2W 2 + 900W

square feet.
7. The area of the rectangle is 2rL (the width is twice the radius of the semi-
circle). The area of the semicircle is half the area of a circle with radius
r, 1
2πr2. The total area of the pool is A = 2rL + 1
2πr2. After ﬁnding an
equation for the perimeter, we will solve the equation for L and substitute
this for L in A = 2rL + 1
2πr2. The perimeter of the rectangular part is
L+2r +L = 2r +2L. The length around the semicircle is half the circum-
ference of a circle with radius r, 1
2(2πr) = πr. The total length around the
pool is 2L + 2r + πr which equals 120 feet.

The maximum area is about 1008.2 square feet.

(0, 0) and (0, y)). The width is x (the distance from (0, 0) and (x, 0)). The
area is now A = xy. Because y = −3x + 4, we can substitute −3x + 4 for
y in A = xy.

CHAPTER
Polynomial
Functions
A polynomial function is a function in the form f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · +
a1x + a0, where each ai is a real number and the powers on x are whole numbers.
There is no x under a root sign and no x in a denominator. The number ai is called a
coefﬁcient. For example, in the polynomial function f (x) = −2x3 +5x2 −4x +8,
the coefﬁcients are −2, 5, −4, and 8. The constant term (the term with no variable)
is 8. The powers on x are 3, 2, and 1. The degree of the polynomial (and polynomial
function) is the highest power on x. In this example, the degree is 3. Quadratic
functions are degree 2. Linear functions of the form f (x) = mx + b (if m ̸= 0) are
degree 1. Constant functions of the form f (x) = b are degree 0 (this is because
x0 = 1, making f (x) = bx0).
The leading term of a polynomial (and polynomial function) is the term having x
to the highest power. Usually, but not always, the leading term is written ﬁrst. The
leading coefﬁcient is the coefﬁcient on the leading term. In our example, the leading
term is −2x3, and the leading coefﬁcient is −2. By looking at the leading term only,
we can tell roughly what the graph looks like. The graph of any polynomial will

either go up on both ends, go down on both ends, or go up on one end and down on
the other. This is called the end behavior of the graph. The ﬁgures below illustrate
the end behavior of polynomial functions. The shape of the dashed part of the graph
depends on the individual function.
Fig. 7.1.
This graph goes up on both ends.
Fig. 7.2.
This graph goes down on both ends.
Fig. 7.3.
This graph goes down on the left and up on the right.

CHAPTER 7

136
Fig. 7.4.
This graph goes up on the left and down on the right.
If the degree of the polynomial is an even number, the graph will look like the
graph in Figure 7.1 or in Figure 7.2. If the leading coefﬁcient is a positive number,
the graph will look like the graph in Figure 7.1. If the leading coefﬁcient is a
negative number, the graph will look like the graph in Figure 7.2. If the degree of
the polynomial is an odd number, the graph will look like the one in Figure 7.3 or in
Figure 7.4. If the leading coefﬁcient is a positive number, the graph will look like
the graph in Figure 7.3. If the leading coefﬁcient is a negative number, the graph
will look like the graph in Figure 7.4.
How can one term in a polynomial function give us this information? For poly-
nomial functions, the leading term dominates all of the other terms. For x-values
large enough (both large positive numbers and large negative numbers), the other
terms don’t contribute much to the size of the y-values.
EXAMPLES
Match the graph of the given function with one of the graphs in Figures
7.1–7.4.
•
f (x) = 4x5 + 6x3 −2x2 + 8x + 11
We only need to look at the leading term, 4x5. The degree, 5, is odd, and the
leading coefﬁcient, 4, is positive. The graph of this function looks like the
one in Figure 7.3.
•
P(x) = 5 + 2x −6x2
The leading term is −6x2. The degree, 2, is even, and the leading coef-
ﬁcient, −6, is negative. The graph of this function looks like the one in
Figure 7.2.

CHAPTER 7

137
•
h(x) = −2x3 + 4x2 −7x + 9
The leading term is −2x3. The degree, 3, is odd, and the leading coefﬁcient,
−2, is negative. The graph of this function looks like the one in Figure 7.4.
•
g(x) = x4 + 4x3 −8x2 + 3x −5
The leading term is x4. The degree, 4, is even, and the leading coefﬁcient, 1,
is positive. The graph of this function looks like the one in Figure 7.1.
Finding the x-intercepts (if any) for the graph of a polynomial function is very
important. The x-intercept of any graph is where the graph touches the x-axis. This
happens when the y-coordinate of the point is 0. We found the x-intercepts for
some quadratic functions by factoring and setting each factor equal to zero. This
is how we will ﬁnd the x-intercepts for polynomial functions. It is not always easy
to do. In fact, some polynomials are so hard to factor that the best we can do is
approximate the x-intercepts (using graphing calculators or calculus). This will not
be the case for the polynomials in this book, however. Every polynomial here will
be factorable using techniques covered later.
Because an x-intercept for f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 is a
solution to the equation 0 = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0, x-intercepts are
also called zeros of the polynomial. All of the following statements have the same
meaning for a polynomial. Let c be a real number, and let P(x) be a polynomial
function.
1.
c is an x-intercept of the graph of P(x).
2.
c is a zero for P(x).
3.
x −c is a factor of P(x).
EXAMPLES
•
x −1 is a factor means that 1 is an x-intercept and a zero.
•
x + 5 is a factor means that −5 is an x-intercept and a zero.
•
x is a factor means that 0 is an x-intercept and a zero.
•
3 is a zero means that x −3 is a factor and 3 is an x-intercept.
We can ﬁnd the zeros of a function (or at least the approximate zeros) by looking
at its graph.
The x-intercepts of the graph in Figure 7.5 are 2 and −2. Now we know that
x −2 and x + 2 (which is x −(−2)) are factors of the polynomial.
The graph of the polynomial function in Figure 7.6 has x-intercepts of −1, 1,
and 2. This means that x −1, x −2, and x + 1 (as x −(−1)) are factors of the
polynomial.

Fig. 7.7.
The x-intercepts for the graph in Figure 7.7 are −3, 0, and 2, making x + 3,
x (as x −0), and x −2 factors of the polynomial.
Now that we know about the end behavior of the graphs of polynomial functions
and the relationship between x-intercepts and factors, we can look at a polynomial
and have a pretty good idea of what its graph looks like. In the next set of examples,
we will match the graphs from the previous section with their polynomial functions.

Because f (x) is a polynomial whose degree is even and whose leading
coefﬁcient is positive, we will look for a graph that goes up on the left and up
on the right. Because the factors are x2, x + 3, and x −2, we will also look
for a graph with x-intercepts 0, −3, and 2. The graph in Figure 7.7 satisﬁes
these conditions.
•
g(x) = −1
2(x −1)(x −2)(x + 1) = −1
2x3 + x2 + 1
2x −1
Because g(x) is a polynomial whose degree is odd and whose leading coef-
ﬁcient is negative, we will look for a graph that goes up on the left and down
on the right. The factors are x −1, x −2, and x + 1, we will also look for
a graph with 1, 2, and −1 as x-intercepts. The graph in Figure 7.6 satisﬁes
these conditions.

P(x) = 1

Because P(x) is a polynomial whose degree is odd and whose leading term
is positive, we will look for a graph that goes down on the left and up on
the right. The x-intercepts are 2 and −2. The graph in Figure 7.5 satisﬁes
these conditions.
Sketching Graphs of Polynomials
To sketch the graph of most polynomial functions accurately, we need to use
calculus (don’t let that scare you—the calculus part is easier than the algebra
part!) We can still get a pretty good graph using algebra alone. The general
method is to plot x-intercepts (if there are any), a point to the left of the small-
est x-intercept, a point between any two x-intercepts, and a point to the right of the
largest x-intercept. Because y-intercepts are easy to ﬁnd, it wouldn’t hurt to plot
these, too.
EXAMPLES
•
f (x) = −(2x −1)(x + 2)(x −3)
The x-intercepts are −2, 3, and 1
2 (from 2x −1 = 0). In addition to the
x-intercepts, we will plot the points for x = −2.5 (to the left of x = −2),
x = −1 (between x = −2 and x = 1
2), x = 2 (between x = 1
2 and x = 3),
and x = 3.5 (to the right of x = 3).

Polynomial Division
Polynomials can be divided in much the same way as whole numbers. When we
take the quotient of two whole numbers (where the divisor is not zero), we get
a quotient and a remainder. The same happens when we take the quotient of two
polynomials. Polynomial division is useful when factoring polynomials.
Polynomial division problems usually come in one of two forms.
dividend polynomial
divisor polynomial or dividend polynomial ÷ divisor polynomial
According to the division algorithm for polynomials, for any polynomials f (x) and
g(x) (with g(x) not the zero function)
f (x)
g(x) = q(x) + r(x)
g(x),
where q(x) is the quotient (which might be 0) and r(x) is the remainder, which
has degree strictly less than the degree of g(x). Multiplying by g(x) to clear the
fraction, we also get f (x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x). First we will perform polynomial
division using long division.

by x. You might see right away that 4x2 ÷ x is 4x. If not, write 4x2 ÷ x as
a fraction then reduce: 4x2
x = 4x. This will be the ﬁrst term of the quotient.

Because −10x

cannot be a term in a polynomial, we are done. The quotient is
3x2 −x + 7, and the remainder is −10x + 20.
It is important that every power of x, from the highest power to the constant term,
be represented in the polynomial. Although it is possible to perform long division
without all powers represented, it is very easy to make an error. Also, it is not
possible to perform synthetic division (later in this chapter) without a coefﬁcient
for every term. If a power of x is not written, we need to rewrite the polynomial
(either the dividend, divisor, or both) using a coefﬁcient of 0 on the missing powers.
For example, we would write x3 −1 as x3 + 0x2 + 0x −1.

Polynomial division is a little trickier when the leading coefﬁcient of the divisor
is not 1. The terms of the quotient are harder to ﬁnd and are likely to be fractions.

Synthetic division of polynomials is much easier than long division. It
only works when the divisor is of a certain form, though. Here, we will
use synthetic division when the divisor is of the form “x −number” or
“x + number.”
For a problem of the form
anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0
x −c
or
(anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0) ÷ (x −c),
write
c an an−1 . . . a1
a0
Every power of x must be represented.
In synthetic division, the tedious work in long division is reduced to a few
steps.

of the quotient is 2. The last number on the bottom row is the remainder. The

When dividing a polynomial f (x) by x −c, the remainder tells us two
things. If we get a remainder of 0, then both the divisor, (x −c), and

CHAPTER 7
Polynomial Functions
151
quotient are factors of f (x). Another fact we get from the remainder is that
f (c) = remainder.
f (x) = (x −c)q(x) + remainder
f (c) = (c −c)q(c) + remainder
Evaluate f (x) at x = c.
f (c) = 0q(c) + remainder
f (c) = remainder
The fact that f (c) is the remainder is called the Remainder Theorem. It is
useful when trying to evaluate complicated polynomials. We can also use this
fact to check our work with synthetic division and long division (providing
the divisor is x −c).
•
(x3 −6x2 + 4x −5) ÷ (x −3)

The remainder is 16, so f (1) = 16.
Now we will use synthetic division and the Remainder Theorem to factor poly-
nomials. Suppose x = c is a zero for a polynomial f (x). Let us see what happens
when we divide f (x) by x −c.
f (x) = (x −c)q(x) + r(x)
Because x = c is a zero, the remainder is 0, so f (x) = (x −c)q(x) + 0, which
means f (x) = (x −c)q(x). The next step in completely factoring f (x) is factoring
q(x), if necessary.

quadratic formula.
x2 −3x −10 = (x −5)(x + 2)
Now we have the complete factorization of f (x):
f (x) = x3 −4x2 −7x + 10

In the above examples and practice problems, a zero was given to help us get
started with factoring. Usually, we have to ﬁnd a starting point ourselves. The
Rational Zero Theorem gives us a place to start. The Rational Zero Theorem says
that if a polynomial function f (x), with integer coefﬁcients, has a rational number
p/q as a zero, then p is a divisor of the constant term and q is a divisor of the
leading coefﬁcient. Not all polynomials have rational zeros, but most of those in
precalculus courses do.
The Rational Zero Theorem is used to create a list of candidates for zeros. These
candidates are rational numbers whose numerators divide the polynomial’s constant
term and whose denominators divide its leading coefﬁcient. Once we have this list,
we will try each number in the list to see which, if any, are zeros. Once we have
found a zero, we can begin to factor the polynomial.
EXAMPLES
List the possible rational zeros.
•
f (x) = 4x3 + 6x2 −2x + 9

CHAPTER 7
Polynomial Functions
157
The numerators in our list will be the divisors of 9: 1, 3, and 9 as well as
their negatives, −1, −3, and −9. The denominators will be the divisors of
4: 1, 2, and 4. The list of possible rational zeros is—
1

2, ±3
2,
±9
2, ±1
4, ±3
4, ±9
4.
We only need to list the numerators with negative numbers and not the
denominators. The reason is that no new numbers are added to the list, only
duplicates of numbers already there. For example, −1
2 and
1
−2 are the same
number.
•
g(x) = 6x4 −5x3 + 2x −8
The possible numerators are the divisors of 8: ±1, ±2, ±4, and ±8. The
possible denominators are the divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, and 6. The list of
possible rational zeros is—
± 1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±1
2, ±2
2, ±4

2, ±1
3, ±2
3, ±4

6.
There are several duplicates on this list. There will be duplicates when the
constant term and leading coefﬁcient have common factors. The duplicates
don’t really hurt anything, but they could waste time when checking the list
for zeros.
Now that we have a starting place, we can factor many polynomials. Here is
the strategy. First we will see if the polynomial can be factored directly. If not,
we need to list the possible rational zeros. Then we will try the numbers in this
list, one at a time, until we ﬁnd a zero. Once we have found a zero, we will use
polynomial division (long division or synthetic division) to ﬁnd the quotient. Next,
we will factor the quotient. If the quotient is a quadratic factor, we will either
factor it directly or use the quadratic formula to ﬁnd its zeros. If the quotient is a
polynomial of degree 3 or higher, we will need to start over to factor the quotient.
Eventually, the quotient will be a quadratic factor.

to test every one of them. The fastest way is to use a graphing calculator

There are also a couple of algebra facts that can help eliminate some of the
possible rational zeros. The ﬁrst we will learn is Descartes’ Rule of Signs. The
second is the Upper and Lower Bounds Theorem. Descartes’ Rule of Signs counts
the number of positive zeros and negative zeros. For instance, according to the
rule f (x) = x3 + x2 + 4x + 6 has no positive zeros at all. This shrinks the list
of possible rational zeros from ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6 to −1, −2, −3, and −6.
Another advantage of the sign test is that if we know that there are two positive
zeros and we have found one of them, then we know that there is exactly one more.
The Upper and Lower Bounds Theorem gives us an idea of how large (in
both the positive and negative directions) the zeros can be. For example, we
can use the Upper and Lower Bounds Theorem to show that all of the zeros for
f (x) = 5x3 + 20x2 −9x −36 are between −5 and 5. This shrinks the list of
possible rational zeros from ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±9, ±12, ±18, ±36,

Descartes’ Rule of Signs counts the number of positive zeros and the number
of negative zeros by counting sign changes. The maximum number of positive
zeros for a polynomial function is the number of sign changes in f (x) = anxn +
an−1xn−1 +· · ·+a1x +a0. The possible number of positive zeros is the number of
sign changes minus an even whole number. For example, if there are 5 sign changes,
there are 5 or 3 or 1 positive zeros. If there are 6 sign changes, there are 6 or 4 or 2
or 0 positive zeros. The polynomial function f (x) = 3x4 −2x3 + 7x2 + 5x −8
has 3 sign changes: from 3 to −2, from −2 to 7, and from 5 to −8. There are either
3 or 1 positive zeros. The maximum number of negative zeros is the number of
sign changes in the polynomial f (−x). The possible number of negative zeros is
the number of sign changes in f (−x) minus an even whole number.
EXAMPLES
Use Descartes’ Rule of Signs to count the possible number of positive zeros and
negative zeros for the polynomial functions.

•
f (x) = 5x3 −6x2 −10x + 4
There are 2 sign changes: from 5 to −6 and from −10 to 4. This means that
there are either 2 or 0 positive zeros. Before we count the possible number
of negative zeros, remember from earlier in the book that for a number a,
a(−x)even power = axeven power and a(−x)odd power = −axodd power.
f (−x) = 5(−x)3 −6(−x)2 −10(−x) + 4
= −5x3 −6x2 + 10x + 4
There is 1 sign change, from −6 to 10, so there is exactly 1 negative zero.
•
P(x) = x5 + x3 + x + 4
There are no sign changes, so there are no positive zeros.
P(−x) = (−x)5 + (−x)3 + (−x) + 4
= −x5 −x3 −x + 4
There is 1 sign change, so there is exactly 1 negative zero.
The Upper and Lower Bounds Theorem helps us to ﬁnd a range of x-values that
will contain all real zeros. It does not tell us what these bounds are. We make a
guess as to what these bounds are then check them. For a negative number x = a,
the statement “a is a lower bound for the real zeros” means that there is no number
to the left of x = a on the x-axis that is a zero. For a positive number x = b, the
statement “b is an upper bound for the real zeros” means that there is no number to
the right of x = b on the x-axis that is a zero. In other words, all of the x-intercepts
are between a and b.
To determine whether a negative number x = a is a lower bound for a polyno-
mial, we need to use synthetic division. If the numbers in the bottom row alternate
between nonpositive and nonnegative numbers, then x = a is a lower bound for
the negative zeros. A “nonpositive” number is 0 or negative, and a “nonnegative”
number is 0 or positive.
To determine whether a positive number x = b is an upper bound for the positive
zeros, again we need to use synthetic division. If the numbers on the bottom row
are all nonnegative, then x = b is an upper bound on the positive zeros.
EXAMPLES
Show that the given values for a and b are lower, and upper bounds, respectively,
for the following polynomials.

The entries on the bottom row are all positive, so b = 5 is an upper bound for
the positive zeros of f (x). All of the real zeros for f (x) are between x = −5
and x = 5.
If 0 appears on the bottom row when testing for an upper bound, we can
consider 0 to be positive. If 0 appears in the bottom row when testing for a
lower bound, we can consider 0 to be negative if the previous entry is positive
and positive if the previous entry is negative. In other words, consider 0 to
be the opposite sign as the previous entry.

Because 0 follows a positive number, we will consider 0 to be negative. This
makes the bottom row alternate between positive and negative entries, so
a = −5 is a lower bound for the negative zeros of P(x).
The Upper and Lower Bounds Theorem has some limitations. For instance, it
does not tell us how to ﬁnd upper and lower bounds for the zeros of a polynomial.
For any polynomial, there are inﬁnitely many upper and lower bounds. For instance,
if x = 5 is an upper bound, then any number larger than 5 is also an upper
bound. For many polynomials, a starting place is the quotient of the constant
term and the leading coefﬁcient and its negative: ±
constant term
leading coefﬁcient. First show
that these are bounds for the zeros, then work your way inward. For example, if
f (x) = 2x3 −7x2 + x + 50, let a = −50
2 = −25 and b = 50
2 = 25. Then, let a
and b get closer together, say a = −10 and b = 10.

Complex Numbers
Until now, zeros of polynomials have been real numbers. The next topic involves
complex zeros. These zeros come from even roots of negative numbers like
√
−1.
Before working with complex zeros of polynomials, we will ﬁrst learn some
complex number arithmetic. Complex numbers are normally written in the form
a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i =
√
−1. A number such as 4 +
√
−9
would be written as 4 + 3i because
√
−9 =

√
−1 = 3i. Real numbers are
complex numbers where b = 0.

Adding complex numbers is a matter of adding like terms. Add the real parts, a and
c, and the imaginary parts, b and d.
(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i
Subtract two complex numbers by distributing the minus sign in the parentheses
then adding the like terms.
a + bi −(c + di) = a + bi −c −di = (a −c) + (b −d)i
EXAMPLES
Perform the arithmetic. Write the sum or difference in the form a + bi, where a
and b are real numbers.

Multiplying complex numbers is not as straightforward as adding and subtracting
them. First we will take the product of two purely imaginary numbers (numbers
whose real parts are 0). Remember that i =
√
−1, which makes i2 = −1. In most
complex number multiplication problems, we will have a term with i2. Replace
i2 with −1. Multiply two complex numbers in the form a + bi using the FOIL
method, substituting −1 for i2 and combining like terms.
EXAMPLES
Write the product in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers.

The complex numbers a + bi and a −bi are called complex conjugates. The
only difference between a complex number and its conjugate is the sign between
the real part and the imaginary part. The product of any complex number and its
conjugate is a real number.
(a + bi)(a −bi) = a2 −abi + abi −b2i2
= a2 −b2(−1)
= a2 + b2
EXAMPLES
•
The complex conjugate of 3 + 2i is 3 −2i.
•
The complex conjugate of −7 −i is −7 + i.
•
The complex conjugate of 10i is −10i.
•
(7 −2i)(7 + 2i). Here, a = 7 and b = 2, so a2 = 49 and b2 = 4, making
(7 −2i)(7 + 2i) = 49 + 4 = 53.
•
(1 −i)(1 + i). Here a = 1 and b = 1, so a2 = 1 and b2 = 1, making
(1 −i)(1 + i) = 1 + 1 = 2.

What does work is to multiply the fraction by the denominator’s conjugate over
itself. This works because the product of any complex number and its conjugate is
a real number. We will use the FOIL method in the numerator (if necessary) and
the fact that (a + bi)(a −bi) = a2 + b2 in the denominator.

There are reasons to write complex numbers in the form a + bi. One is that
complex numbers are plotted in the plane (real numbers are plotted on the number
line), where the x-axis becomes the real axis and the y-axis becomes the imaginary
axis. The number 3 −4i is plotted in Figure 7.15.

In this problem, the complex solutions to the quadratic equation came in
conjugate pairs. This always happens when the solutions are complex numbers.
A quadratic expression that has complex zeros is called irreducible (over the reals)
because it cannot be factored using real numbers. For example, the polynomial
function f (x) = x4 −1 can be factored using real numbers as (x2 −1)(x2 + 1) =
(x −1)(x + 1)(x2 + 1). The factor x2 + 1 is irreducible because it is factored as
(x −i)(x + i).
We can tell which quadratic factors are irreducible without having to use
the quadratic formula. We only need part of the quadratic formula, b2 −4ac.
When this number is negative, the quadratic factor has two complex zeros,
−b±√

solutions, −b±√

. When this number is zero, there is one real zero,
−b±
√

2a
= −b
2a . For this reason, b2 −4ac is called the discriminant.
The graphs of some polynomials having irreducible quadratic factors need extra
points plotted to get a more accurate graph. The graph in Figure 7.17 shows the
graph of f (x) = x4 −3x2 −4 using our usual method—plotting the x-intercepts,
a point to the left of the smallest x-intercept, a point between each consecutive pair
of x-intercepts, and a point to the right of the largest x-intercept.
See what happens to the graph when we plot the points for x = 1 and x = −1.
The graph of f (x) = (x −2)(x2 + 6x + 10) is sketched in Figure 7.19. The
graphs we have sketched have several vertices between x-intercepts. When this
happens, we need calculus to ﬁnd them.

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, every polynomial of degree n has exactly
n zeros (some might be counted more than once). Because x = c is a zero
implies x −c is a factor, every polynomial can be completely factored in the
form a(x −cn)(x −cn−1) . . . (x −c1), where a is a real number and ci is real or
complex. Factors in the form x −c are called linear factors. Factors such as 2x +1
can be written in the form x −c by factoring 2: 2(x + 1
2) or 2(x −(−1
2)).
To completely factor a polynomial, we usually need to ﬁrst ﬁnd its zeros.
At times, we will use the Rational Zero Theorem, polynomial division, and the
quadratic formula.
EXAMPLES
Find all zeros, real and complex.

h(x) = x4 −16
x4 −16 = (x2 −4)(x2 + 4) = (x −2)(x + 2)(x2 + 4)

x2 + 4 = 0.

If we know a complex number is a zero for a polynomial, we automatically
know another zero—the complex conjugate is also a zero. This gives us a quadratic
factor for the polynomial. Once we have this computed, we can use long division
to ﬁnd the quotient, which will be another factor of the polynomial. Each time we
factor a polynomial, we are closer to ﬁnding its zeros.
EXAMPLES
Find all zeros, real and complex.
•
f (x) = 3x4 + x3 + 17x2 + 4x + 20 and x = 2i is a zero.
Because x = 2i is a zero, its conjugate, −2i, is another zero. This tells us
that two factors are x −2i and x + 2i.
(x −2i)(x + 2i) = x2 + 2ix −2ix −4i2 = x2 −4(−1) = x2 + 4
We will divide f (x) by x2 + 4 = x2 + 0x + 4.

h(x) = 2x3 −7x2 + 170x −246, x = 1 + 9i is a zero.
Because x = 1 + 9i is a zero, we know that x = 1 −9i is also a zero. We
also know that x −(1 + 9i) = x −1 −9i and x −(1 −9i) = x −1 + 9i
are factors. We will multiply these two factors.
(x −1 −9i)(x −1 + 9i) = x2 −x + 9ix −x + 1 −9i −9ix + 9i −81i2

The zeros are 1 ± 9i and 3

A consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is that a polynomial of
degree n will have n zeros, though not necessarily n different zeros. For example,
the polynomial f (x) = (x −2)3 = (x −2)(x −2)(x −2) has x = 2 as a zero
three times. The number of times an x-value is a zero is called its multiplicity.
In the above example, x = 2 is a zero with multiplicity 3.
EXAMPLE
•
f (x) = x4(x + 3)2(x −6)
x = 0 is a zero with multiplicity 4 (We can think of x4 as (x −0)4.)
x = −3 is a zero with multiplicity 2
x = 6 is a zero with multiplicity 1
Now, instead of ﬁnding the zeros for a given polynomial, we will ﬁnd a poly-
nomial with the given zeros. Because we will know the zeros, we will know
the factors. Once we know the factors of a polynomial, we pretty much know
the polynomial.
EXAMPLES
Find a polynomial with integer coefﬁcients having the given degree and zeros.
•
Degree 3 with zeros 1, 2, and 5
Because x = 1 is a zero, x −1 is a factor. Because x = 2 is a zero, x −2 is
a factor. And because x = 5 is a zero, x −5 is a factor. Such a polynomial

CHAPTER 7

178
will be of the form a(x −1)(x −2)(x −5), where a is some nonzero number.
We will want to choose a so that the coefﬁcients are integers.
a(x −1)(x −2)(x −5) = a(x −1)[(x −2)(x −5)]
= a(x −1)(x2 −7x + 10)
= a(x3 −7x2 + 10x −x2 + 7x −10)
= a(x3 −8x2 + 17x −10)
Because the coefﬁcients are already integers, we can let a = 1. One poly-
nomial of degree three having integer coefﬁcients and 1, 2, and 5 as zeros
is x3 −8x2 + 17x −10.
•
Degree 4 with zeros −3, 2 −5i, with −3 a zero of multiplicity 2
Because −3 is a zero of multiplicity 2, (x + 3)2 = x2 + 6x + 9 is a factor.
Because 2 −5i is a zero, 2 + 5i is another zero. Another factor of the
polynomial is
(x −(2 −5i))(x −(2 + 5i)) = (x −2 + 5i)(x −2 −5i)
= x2 −2x −5ix −2x + 4 + 10i + 5ix
−10i −25i2
= x2 −4x + 4 −25(−1) = x2 −4x + 29.
The polynomial has the form a(x2 + 6x + 9)(x2 −4x + 29), where a is any
real number that makes all coefﬁcients integers.
a(x2 + 6x + 9)(x2 −4x + 29) = a(x4 −4x3 + 29x2 + 6x3 −24x2
+ 174x + 9x2 −36x + 261)
= a(x4 + 2x3 + 14x2 + 138x + 261)
Because the coefﬁcients are already integers, we can let a = 1. One
polynomial that satisﬁes the given conditions is x4+2x3+14x2+138x+261.
In the previous problems, there were inﬁnitely many answers because a
could be any integer. In the following problem, there will be exactly one
polynomial that satisﬁes the given conditions. This means that a will likely
be a number other than 1.

Degree 3 with zeros −1, −2, and 4, where the coefﬁcient for x is −20
a(x + 1)(x + 2)(x −4) = a(x + 1)[(x + 2)(x −4)]
= a(x + 1)(x2 −2x −8)
= a(x3 −2x2 −8x + x2 −2x −8)
= a(x3 −x2 −10x −8)
= ax3 −ax2 −10ax −8a
Because we need the coefﬁcient of x to be −20, we need −10ax = −20x,
so we need a = 2 (from −10a = −20). The polynomial that satisﬁes the
conditions is 2x3 −2x2 −20x −16.

CHAPTER
Rational Functions
A rational function is a function that can be written as one polynomial divided by
another.
f (x) = P(x)
Q(x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0
bmxm + bm−1xm−1 + · · · + b1x + b0
Polynomial functions are a special kind of rational function whose denominator
function is Q(x) = 1. While the graph of every polynomial function has exactly
one y-intercept, the graph of a rational function might not have a y-intercept. If it
has a y-intercept, it can be found by setting x equal to zero.If it has any x-intercepts,
they can be found by setting the numerator equal to zero.
The graphs of rational functions often come in pieces. For every x-value that
causes a zero in the denominator, there will be a break in the graph. If the function is
reduced to lowest terms (the numerator and denominator have no common factors),
then there will be a vertical asymptote at these breaks. The graph rises (or falls) very
fast near these asymptotes. The graph in Figure 8.1 is the graph of f (x) =
1
x−1.
It has a vertical asymptote at the line x = 1 because x = 1 causes a zero in the
denominator.

Fig. 8.1.
A vertical asymptote shows that the y-values get large when the x-values get
close to a zero in the denominator. To see this, we will evaluate f (x) =
1
x−1 at
x = 0.99 and x = 1.01, two x-values close to a zero in the denominator.
f (0.99) =
1
0.99 −1 = −100
and
f (1.01) =
1
1.01 −1 = 100
The graph ﬂattens out horizontally near a horizontal asymptote. The graph in
Figure 8.1 has the x-axis as its horizontal asymptote. Ahorizontal asymptote shows
that as x gets very large, the y-values get very close to a ﬁxed number. In the func-
tion f (x) =
1
x−1, there is a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 (the x-axis). This means
that as x gets large, the y-values get close to 0.
f (100) =

99 ≈0.010101 and
f (−100) =

101 ≈−0.009901
Vertical asymptotes are easy to ﬁnd—set the denominator equal to zero and solve
for x. Whether or not a graph has a horizontal asymptote depends on the degree of
the numerator and of the denominator.
•
If the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator,
there is no horizontal asymptote.
•
If the degree of the denominator is larger than the degree of the numerator,
there is a horizontal asymptote at y = 0, which is the x-axis.

CHAPTER 8

•
If the degree of the numerator equals the degree of the denominator, there is
a horizontal asymptote at y = an
bm , where an is the leading coefﬁcient of the
numerator and bm is the leading coefﬁcient of the denominator.

3 is the
vertical asymptote for this graph. There is no horizontal asymptote because
the degree of the numerator, 2, is more than the degree of the denominator, 1.

x2 −4x −5
When we solve x2 −4x −5 = 0, we get the solutions x = 5, −1. This graph
has two vertical asymptotes, the vertical lines x = 5 and x = −1. The x-axis
is the horizontal asymptote because the degree of the numerator, 0, is less
than the degree of the denominator, 2. (A reminder, the degree of a constant
term is 0, 15 = 15x0.) There is no x-intercept because the numerator of this
fraction is always 15, it is never 0. The y-intercept is

02 −4(0) −5 = −3.

Becausex2+2 = 0hasnorealsolutions, thisgraphhasnoverticalasymptote.
There is a horizontal asymptote at y = 3
1 = 3 because the degree of the
numerator and denominator is the same. The x-intercept is 0 (from 3x2 = 0).
The y-intercept is
3(0)2
02 + 2 = 0
2 = 0.
The reason we can ﬁnd the horizontal asymptotes so easily is that for
large values of x, only the leading terms in the numerator and denominator

really matter. The examples below will show an algebraic reason for the rules
above. For any ﬁxed number c any positive power on x,
c

is almost 0 for large values of x. For example, in −10
x2 , if we let x be any large
number, the fraction will be close to 0.

(100)2 = −0.001
The larger x is, the closer to 0 −10
x2 is.
EXAMPLES
•
f (x) = 3x3 + 5x2 + x −6
2x4 + 8x2 −1
From above, we know that the x-axis, or the horizontal line y = 0, is a
horizontal asymptote. Here is why. Because the highest power on x is 4, we
will multiply the fraction by 1/x4
1/x4 , which reduces to 1, so we are not changing
the fraction.

3. There is no vertical asymptote because x2 + 1 = 0 has no real solu-
tion. The horizontal asymptote is y = 1/1 = 1 because the numerator
and denominator have the same degree. The x-intercepts are ±1, from

6. The vertical asymptote is x = 0, from x2 = 0. The horizontal asymp-
tote y = 0 because the denominator has the higher degree. There is no
x-intercept because the numerator is 2, never 0. There is no y-intercept
because 2/02 is not deﬁned.
When sketching the graph of a rational function, we use dashed lines for the asymp-
totes . We will sketch the graphs of rational functions in much the same way we
sketched the graphs of polynomial functions. In addition to the points we plot for
polynomial functions, we need to plot points to illustrate the asymptotic behavior
of the graph. To show how a graph behaves near a vertical asymptote, we need to
plot a point to its left and to its right. To show how a graph behaves near a horizontal
asymptote, we need to plot points with large enough x-values, both positive and
negative, to show how the graph ﬂattens out. When a graph has both horizontal and
vertical asymptotes, we will also plot a couple of mid-sized x-values.

The x-axis is the horizontal asymptote. This graph has no x-intercept. The
y-intercept is 1. We will use x = 5, −5 to show the graph’s horizontal
asymptotic behavior. The function is even, so the left half is a reﬂection of
the right half. We will plot points for x = 1, 2. The y-values for x = −1, −2

the vertical asymptotes. To get a better idea of what the graph looks like, we
will need to plot other points. We will use x = 2 and x = −2.

If the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than the degree of the denom-
inator, then the graph has a slant asymptote. We can ﬁnd the equation of a slant
asymptote (a line whose slope is a nonzero number) by performing polynomial
division. The equation for the slant asymptote is y = quotient.

When sketching the graph of a rational function that has a slant asymptote, we
can show the behavior of the graph near the slant asymptote by plotting points for
larger x-values. We can tell if an x-value is large enough by checking its y-values
in both the line and rational function. If they are fairly close, then the x-value is
large enough.

Compound Growth
A quantity (such as a population, amount of money, or radiation level) changes
exponentially if the growth or loss is a ﬁxed percentage over a period of time. To
see how this works, we will see how the value of an account grows over four years
if $100 is deposited and earns 5% interest, compounded annually. Compounded
annually means that the interest earned in the previous year earns interest.
After one year, $100 has grown to 100 + 0.05(100) = 100 + 5 = $105. In
the second year, the original $100 earns 5% plus the $5 earns 5% interest: 105 +
(105)(0.05) = $110.25. Now this amount earns interest in the third year: 110.25+
(110.25)(0.05) = $115.76. Finally, this amount earns interest in the fourth year:
115.76 + (115.76)(0.05) = $121.55. If interest is not compounded, that is, the

interest does not earn interest, the account would only be worth $120. The extra
$1.55 is interest earned on interest.
Compound growth is not dramatic over the short run but it is over time. If $100 is
left in an account earning 5% interest, compounded annually, for 20 years instead
of four years, the difference between the compound growth and noncompound
growth is a little more interesting. After 20 years, the compound amount is $265.33
compared to $200 for simple interest (noncompound growth).Agraph of the growth
of each type over 40 years is given in Figure 9.1. The line is the growth for simple
(noncompounded) interest, and the curve is the growth with compound interest.
Fig. 9.1.
We can use a formula to compute the value of an account earning compounded
interest. If P dollars is invested for t years, earning r interest rate, then it will grow
to A dollars, where A = P(1 + r)t.
EXAMPLES
Find the compound amount.
•
$5000, after three years, earning 6% interest, compounded annually
We will use the formula A = P(1 + r)t. P = 5000, r = 0.06, and t = 3.
We want to know A, the compound amount.
A = 5000(1 + 0.06)3 = 5000(1.06)3 = 5000(1.191016)
= 5955.08
The compound amount is $5955.08.

≈17,505.66
The compound amount is $17,505.66
Many investments pay more often than once a year, some paying interest daily.
Instead of using the annual interest rate, we need to use the interest rate per period,
and instead of using the number of years, we need to use the number of periods. If
there are n compounding periods per year, then the interest rate per period is r
n and
the total number of periods is nt. The compound amount formula becomes

The more often interest is compounded per year, the more interest is earned.
$1000 earning 8% annual interest, compounded annually, is worth $1080 after one
year. If interest is compounded quarterly, it is worth $1082.43 after one year. And
if interest is compounded daily, it is worth $1083.28 after one year. What if interest
is compounded each hour? Each second? It turns out that the most this investment
could be worth (at 8% interest) is $1083.29, when interest is compounded each
and every instant of time. Each instant of time, a tiny amount of interest is earned.
This is called continuous compounding. The formula for the compound amount for
interest compounded continuously is A = Pert, where A, P, r, and t are the same
quantities as before. The letter e stands for a constant called Euler’s number. It is
approximately 2.718281828. You probably have an e or ex key on your calculator.
Although e is irrational, it can be approximated by numbers of the form

1 + 1
m
m
,
where m is a large rational number. The larger m is, the better the approximation
for e. If we make the substitution m = n
r and use some algebra, we can see how
(1 + r
n)nt is very close to ert, for large values of n. If interest is compounded every
minute, n would be 525,600, a rather large number!
EXAMPLE
•
Find the compound amount of $5000 after eight years, earning 12% annual
interest, compounded continuously.
A = 5000e0.12(8) = 5000e0.96 ≈5000(2.611696) ≈13,058.48
The compound amount is $13,058.48.
The compound growth formula for continuously compounded interest is used
for other growth and decay problems. The general exponential growth model is
n(t) = n0ert, where n(t) replaces A and n0 replaces P . Their meanings are the
same—n(t) is still the compound growth, and n0 is still the beginning amount.
The variable t represents time in this formula; although, time will not always be
measured in years. The growth rate and t need to have the same unit of measure.
If the growth rate is in days, then t needs to be in days. If the growth rate is in
hours, then t needs to be in hours, and so on. If the “population” is getting smaller,
then the formula is n(t) = n0e−rt.

EXAMPLES
•
The population of a city is estimated to be growing at the rate of 10% per
year. In 2000, its population was 160,000. Estimate its population in the year
2005.
The year 2000 corresponds to t = 0, so the year 2005 corresponds to t = 5;
n0, the population in year t = 0, is 160,000. The population is growing at
the rate of 10% per year, so r = 0.10. The formula n(t) = n0ert becomes
n(t) = 160,000e0.10t. We want to ﬁnd n(t) for t = 5.
n(5) = 160,000e0.10(5) ≈263,795
The city’s population is expected to be 264,000 in the year 2005 (estimates
and projections are normally rounded off).
•
A county is losing population at the rate of 0.7% per year. If the population
in 2001 is 1,000,000, what is it expected to be in the year 2008?
n0 = 1,000,000, t = 0 is the year 2001, t = 7 is the year 2008, and
r = 0.007. Because the county is losing population, we will use the decay
model: n(t) = n0e−rt. The model for this county’s population is n(t) =
1,000,000e−.007t. We want to ﬁnd n(t) for t = 7.
n(7) = 1,000,000e−.007(7) ≈952,181
The population is expected to be 952,000 in the year 2008.
•
In an experiment, a culture of bacteria grew at the rate of 35% per hour. If
1000 bacteria were present at 10:00, how many were present at 10:45?
n0 = 1000, r = 0.35, t is the number of hours after 10:00
The growth model becomes n(t) = 1000e0.35t. We want to ﬁnd n(t) for 45
minutes, or t = 0.75 hours.
n(0.75) = 1000e0.35(0.75) = 1000e0.2625 ≈1300
At 10:45, there were approximately 1300 bacteria present in the culture.

they deposit now so that it grows to $50,000 in 20 years? To answer this question,

CHAPTER 9

we will use the formula A = P(1 + r)t, where we know that A = 50,000 but are
looking for P .
50,000 = P(1 + 0.075)20
= P(1.075)20
50,000
(1.075)20 = P
The couple should deposit $11,770.66 now so that the investment grows to
$50,000 in 20 years.
We say that $11,770.66 is the present value of $50,000 due in 20 years, earning

2% interest, compounded annually. The present value formula is P = A(1+r)−t,
for interest compounded annually, and P = A(1+ r
n)−nt, for interest compounded
n times per year.

Graphs of Exponential Functions
A basic exponential function is of the form f (x) = ax, where a is any positive
number except 1. The graph of f (x) = ax comes in two shapes depending whether
0 < a < 1 (a is positive but smaller than 1) or a > 1. Figure 9.2 is the graph of
f (x) = (1
2)x and Figure 9.3 is the graph of f (x) = 2x.

Logarithms
A common question for investors is, “How long will it take for my investment to
double?” If $1000 is invested so that it earns 8% interest, compounded annually,
how long will it take to grow to $2000? To answer the question using the com-
pound growth formula, we need to solve for t in the equation 2000 = 1000(1.08)t.
We will divide both sides of the equation by 1000 to get 2 = (1.08)t. Now
what? It does not make sense to “take the tth root” of both sides. We need to
use logarithms. In mathematical terms, the logarithm and exponent functions are
inverses. Logarithms (or logs) are very useful in solving many science and business
problems.
The logarithmic equation loga x = y is another way of writing the exponential
equation ay = x. Verbally, we say, “log base a of x is (or equals) y.” For “loga x,
we say,” (the) log base a of x.
EXAMPLES
Rewrite the logarithmic equation as an exponential equation.

log3 9 = 2
The base of the logarithm is the base of the exponent, so 3 will be raised to

The ﬁrst two logarithm properties we will learn are the cancelation properties.
They come directly from rewriting one form of an equation in the other form.
loga ax = x and alogax = x
When the bases of the exponent and logarithm are the same, they cancel. Let us
see why these properties are true. What would the expression loga ax be? We
will rewrite the equation “loga ax =?” as an exponential equation: a? = ax. Now
we can see that “?” is x. This is why loga ax = x. What would aloga x be? We will
rewrite “aloga x =?” as a logarithmic equation: loga? = loga x, so “?” is x, and
aloga x = x.

Two types of logarithms occur frequently enough to have their own notation. They
are loge and log10. The notation for loge is “ln” (pronounced “ell-in”) and is called
the natural log. The notation for log10 is “log” (no base is written) and is called the
common log. The cancel properties for these special logarithms are
ln ex = x
eln x = x
and
log 10x = x
10log x = x.

Exponent and Logarithm Equations (Part I)
Equations with exponents and logarithms come in many forms. Sometimes more
than one strategy will work to solve them. We will ﬁrst solve equations of the
form “log = number” and “log = log.” We will solve an equation of the form
“log = number” by rewriting the equation as an exponential equation.
EXAMPLES
Solve the equation for x.
•
log3(x + 1) = 4
Rewrite the equation as an exponential equation.
log3(x + 1) = 4
34 = x + 1
81 = x + 1
80 = x
•
log2(3x −4) = 5
25 = 3x −4
32 = 3x −4
12 = x
The logarithms cancel for equations in the form “log = log” as long as the bases
are the same. For example, the solution to the equation log8 x = log8 10 is x = 10.
The cancelation law aloga x = x makes this work.
log8 x = log8 10
8log8 x = 8log8 10
x = 10
(By the cancelation law)

The logarithm function f (x) = loga x is the inverse of g(x) = ax. The graph
of f (x) is the graph of g(x) with the x- and y-values reversed. To sketch the
graph by hand, we will rewrite the logarithm function as an exponent equation
and graph the exponent equation.
EXAMPLES
Sketch the graph of the logarithmic functions.

be the numbers −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, and 3.

As long as a is larger than 1, all graphs for f (x) = loga x look pretty much the
same. The larger a is, the ﬂatter the graph is to the right of x = 1. Knowing this
and knowing how to graph transformations, we have a good idea of the graphs of
many logarithmic functions.
•
The graph of f (x) = log2(x −2) is the graph of y = log2 x shifted to the
right 2 units.
•
The graph of f (x) = −5 + log3 x is the graph of y = log3 x shifted down 5
units.

CHAPTER 9

•
f (x) = 1
3 log x is the graph of y = log x ﬂattened vertically by a factor of
one-third.
The domain of f (x) = loga x is all positive numbers. This means that we cannot
take the log of 0 or the log of a negative number. The reason is that a is a positive
number. Raising a positive number to any power is always another positive number.
EXAMPLES
Find the domain. Give your answers in interval notation.
•
f (x) = log5(2 −x)
Because we are taking the log of 2 −x, 2 −x needs to be positive.
2 −x > 0
−x > −2
x < 2
The domain is (−∞, 2).
•
f (x) = log(x2 −x −2)
x2 −x −2 > 0
(x −2)(x + 1) > 0
Put x = 2 and x = −1 on the number line and test to see where (x −2)
(x + 1) > 0 is true.
Fig. 9.13.
We want the “True” intervals, so the domain is (−∞, −1) ∪(2, ∞).
•
g(x) = ln(x2 + 1)
Because x2 +1 is always positive, the domain is all real numbers, (−∞, ∞).

2. Solve x2 −4 > 0

The domain is (−∞, −2) ∪(2, ∞).
3. Because x2 + 4 > 0 is always positive, the domain is all real numbers,
(−∞, ∞).
Exponent and Logarithmic Equations (Part II)
For some logarithmic equations, a solution might be extraneous solution. That
is, such a solution is a solution to the rewritten equations but not to the original
equations. Some solutions to the rewritten equations will cause logarithms of 0
or of negative numbers. We can check them in the original equation to see which
solutions are true solutions.
EXAMPLES
Solve for x.
•
log2(x2 + 3x −10) = 3
We will rewrite this as an exponent equation: 23 = x2 + 3x −10 and solve
for x.
x2 + 3x −10 = 8
x2 + 3x −18 = 0
(x + 6)(x −3) = 0

The solutions are x = −6 and x = 3. We will check them in the original
equation.
log2((−6)2 + 3(−6) −10) = 3?
log2(32 + 3(3) −10) = 3?
log2 8 = 3 True
log2 8 = 3 True
The solutions to the original equation are x = −6 and x = 3.
•
log5(x2 + 5x −4) = log5(x + 1)
The logs cancel leaving x2 + 5x −4 = x + 1.
x2 + 5x −4 = x + 1
x2 + 4x −5 = 0
(x + 5)(x −1) = 0
The solutions are x = −5 and x = 1. We cannot allow x = −5 as a solution
because log5(−5 + 1) is not deﬁned. We need to check x = 1.
log5(12 + 5(1) −4) = log5(1 + 1)
is true
The solution is x = 1.
PRACTICE

1. ln(x2 + x −20) = ln(3x + 4)
2. log4(2x2 −3x + 59) = 3
SOLUTIONS
1. ln(x2 + x −20) = ln(3x + 4)
x2 + x −20 = 3x + 4
x2 −2x −24 = 0
(x −6)(x + 4) = 0
The solutions are x = 6 and x = −4. Because ln[3(−4)+4] is not deﬁned,
we only need to check x = 6.
ln(62 + 6 −20) = ln[3(6) + 4]
is true.
The only solution is x = 6.

Three More Important Logarithm Properties
The following three logarithm properties come directly from the exponent proper-
ties am · an = am+n, am
an = am−n, and amn = (am)n.
1.
logb mn = logb m + logb n
2.
logb
m
n = logb m −logb n
3.
logb mt = t logb m
We will see why Property 1 works. Let x = logb m and y = logb n. Rewriting
these equations as exponential equations, we get bx = m and by = n. Multiplying
m and n, we have mn = bx · by = bx+y. Rewriting the equation mn = bx+y
as a logarithmic equation, we get logb mn = x + y. Because x = logb m and
y = logb n, logb mn = x + y becomes logb mn = logb m + logb n.

Sometimes we will need to use several logarithm properties to rewrite more
complicated logarithms. The hardest part of this is to use the properties in the
correct order. For example, which property should be used ﬁrst on log x
y3 ? Do we
ﬁrst use the third property or the second property? We will use the second property
ﬁrst. For the expression log(x
y )3, we would use the third property ﬁrst.
Going in the other direction, we need to use all three properties in the expression
log2 9 −log2 x + 3 log2 y. We need to use the second property to combine the ﬁrst
two terms.
log2 9 −log2 x + 3 log2 y = log2

More Logarithm Equations
With these logarithm properties we can solve more logarithm equations. We
will use these properties to rewrite equations either in the form “log = log” or
“log = number.” When the equation is in the form “log = log,” the logs cancel.
When the equation is in the form “log = number,” we will rewrite the equation as
an exponential equation. Instead of checking solutions in the original equation, we
only need to make sure that the original logarithms are deﬁned for the solutions.

CHAPTER 9

EXAMPLES
•
log2(x −5) + log2(x + 2) = 3
We will use Property 1 to rewrite the equation in the form “log = number.”
log2(x −5) + log2(x + 2) = 3
log2(x −5)(x + 2) = 3
(x −5)(x + 2) = 23
x2 −3x −10 = 8
x2 −3x −18 = 0
(x −6)(x + 3) = 0
The solutions are x = 6 and x = −3. Because log2(x + 2) is not deﬁned for
x = −3, the only solution is x = 6.
•
2 log5(x + 1) −log5(x −3) = log5 25
We will use Property 3 followed by Property 2 to rewrite the equation in the
form “log = log.”
2 log5(x + 1) −log5(x −3) = log5 25
log5(x + 1)2 −log5(x −3) = log5 25

3. log2(5x + 1) −log2(x −1) = 3
4. 2 log7(x + 1) = 2
SOLUTIONS
1. log3(2x + 1) + log3(x + 4) = 2
Use Property 1.
log3(2x + 1)(x + 4) = 2
Rewrite as an exponent equation.
(2x + 1)(x + 4) = 32
2x2 + 9x + 4 = 9
2x2 + 9x −5 = 0
(2x −1)(x + 5) = 0
Both log3(2x + 1) and log3(x + 5) are undeﬁned for x = −5, so the only
solution is x = 1
2.
2. ln(3x −4) + ln(x + 2) = ln(2x + 1) + ln(x + 2)
Use Property 1.
ln(3x −4)(x + 2) = ln(2x + 1)(x + 2)
The logs cancel.
(3x −4)(x + 2) = (2x + 1)(x + 2)
3x2 + 2x −8 = 2x2 + 5x + 2
x2 −3x −10 = 0
(x −5)(x + 2) = 0
All of ln(3x −4), ln(x + 2), and ln(x + 2) are not deﬁned for x = −2, so
the only solution is x = 5.
3. log2(5x + 1) −log2(x −1) = 3
Use Property 2.
log2
5x + 1
x −1 = 3

2 log7(x + 1) = 2
Use Property 3.
log7(x + 1)2 = 2
Rewrite as an exponent.
(x + 1)2 = 72
(x + 1)(x + 1) = 49
x2 + 2x + 1 = 49
x2 + 2x −48 = 0
(x + 8)(x −6) = 0
The only solution is x = 6 because log7(x + 1) is not deﬁned at x = −8.
We could have solved this problem in fewer steps if we had divided both
sides by 2 in the ﬁrst step, getting log7(x + 1) = 1.
The domains for f (x) = log(x −1)(x +2) and g(x) = log(x −1)+log(x +2)
are not the same, which seems to contradict the ﬁrst logarithm property. Neither
log(x −1) nor log(x + 2) is deﬁned for x = −3 because −3 −1 and −3 + 2 are
negative. But log(x −1)(x + 2) is deﬁned for x = −3 because (−3 −1)(−3 + 2)
is positive. The domain of f (x) will include x-values for which both (x −1) and
(x + 2) are negative.
The Change of Base Formula
There are countless bases for logarithms but calculators usually have only two
logarithms—log and ln. How can we use our calculators to approximate log2 5?
We can use the change of base formula but ﬁrst, let us use logarithm properties to
ﬁnd this number. Let x = log2 5. Then 2x = 5. Take the common log of each side.
log 2x = log 5
Now use the third log property.
x log 2 = log 5
Divide both sides by the number log 2.
x = log 5
log 2 ≈0.698970004
0.301029996 ≈2.321928095
This means that 22.321928095 is very close to 5.

When both sides of an exponential equation have an exponent, we will use
another method to solve for x. We will take either the natural log or the common
log of each side and will use the third logarithm property to move the exponents
in front of the logarithm. Once we have used the third logarithm property, we will
perform the following steps to ﬁnd x.
1.
Distribute the logarithms.
2.
Collect the x terms on one side of the equation and the non-x terms on the
other side.

Applications of Logarithm and
Exponential Equations
Now that we can solve exponential and logarithmic equations, we can solve many
applied problems. We will need the compound growth formula for an investment
earning interest rate r, compounded n times per year for t years, A(t) = P(1+ r
n)nt
and the exponential growth formula for a population growing at the rate of r per
year for t years, n(t) = n0ert. In the problems below, we will be looking for the
time required for an investment to grow to a speciﬁed amount.
EXAMPLES
•
How long will it take for $1000 to grow to $1500 if it earns 8% annual
interest, compounded monthly?
In the formula A(t) = P(1 + r
n)nt we know A(t) = 1500, P = 1000,
r = 0.08, and n = 12. We do not know t.
1500 = 1000

This method works with population models where the population (either of
people, animals, insects, bacteria, etc.) grows or decays at a certain percent
every period. We will use the growth formula n(t) = n0ert. If the population is
decreasing, we will use the decay formula, n(t) = n0e−rt. Because we will be
working with the base e, instead of taking the log of both sides, we will be rewrit-
ing the equations as log equations (this is equivalent to taking the natural log of
both sides).
EXAMPLES

Aschool district estimates that its student population will grow about 5% per
year for the next 15 years. How long will it take the student population to
grow from the current 8000 students to 12,000?
We will solve for t in the equation 12,000 = 8000e0.05t.
12,000 = 8000e0.05t
Divide both sides by 8000.

Finding the Growth Rate
We can ﬁnd the growth rate of a population if we have reason to believe that
it is growing exponentially and if we know the population level at two different
times. We will use the ﬁrst population level as n0. Because we will know another
population level, we have a value for n(t) and for t. This means that the equation
n(t) = n0ert will have only one unknown, r. We can ﬁnd r using natural logarithms
in the same way we found t in the problems above.
EXAMPLES
•
The population of a country is growing exponentially. In the year 2000, it
was 10 million and in 2005, it was 12 million. What is the growth rate?
In the year t = 0 (2000), the population was 10 million, so n0 = 10.
The growth formula becomes n(t) = 10ert. When t = 5 (the year 2005),

CHAPTER 9

the population is 12 million, so n(t) = 12. We will solve the equation

•
Suppose a bacteria culture contains 2500 bacteria at 1:00 and at 1:30 there
are 6000. What is the hourly growth rate?
Because we are asked to ﬁnd the hourly growth rate, t must be measured
in hours and not minutes. Initially, at t = 0, the population is 2500, so
n0 = 2500. Half an hour later, the population is 6000, so t = 0.5 and
n(t) = 6000. We will solve for r in the equation 6000 = 2500e0.5r.
6000 = 2500e0.5r

Radioactive Decay
Some radioactive substances decay at the rate of nearly 100% per year and others at
nearly 0% per year. For this reason, we use the half-life of a radioactive substance to
describe how fast its radioactivity decays. For example, bismuth-210 has a half-life
of 5 days. After 5 days, 16 grams of bismuth-210 decays to 8 grams of bismuth-
210 (and 8 grams of another substance); after 10 days, 4 grams remain, and after
15 days, only 2 grams remains. We can use logarithms and the half-life to ﬁnd
the rate of decay. We will use the decay formula n(t) = n0e−rt in the following
problems.
EXAMPLES
•
Find the daily decay rate of bismuth-210.
Because its half-life is 5 days, at t = 5, one-half of n0 remains, so

ﬁnd t.

Carbon-14 decays at the rate of 0.012% per year.
EXAMPLES
•
How long will it take for 80% of the carbon-14 to decay in an animal after it
has died?
If 80% of the initial amount has decayed, then 20% remains, or 0.20n0.
0.20n0 = n0e−0.00012t
0.20 = e−0.00012t
−0.00012t = ln 0.20
t =
ln 0.20
−0.00012 ≈13, 412
After about 13,400 years, 80% of the carbon-14 will have decayed.
•
Suppose a bone is discovered and has 60% of its carbon-14. How old is the
bone? 60% of its carbon-14 is 0.60n0.
0.60n0 = n0e−0.00012t
0.60 = e−0.00012t
−0.00012t = ln 0.60
t =
ln 0.60
−0.00012 ≈4257
The bone is about 4260 years old.
•
Suppose an animal dies today. How much of its carbon-14 will remain after
250 years?
n(250) = n0e−0.00012(250) ≈0.97n0
About 97% of its carbon-14 will remain after 250 years.

dated, and found to have 70% of its carbon-14 remaining. Estimate the age
of the piece of wood.
2. How long would it take for an object to lose 25% of its carbon-14?
3. Suppose a tree fell 400 years ago. How much of its carbon-14 remains?
SOLUTIONS
1.
0.70n0 = n0e−0.00012t
0.70 = e−0.00012t
−0.00012t = ln 0.70
t =
ln 0.70
−0.00012 ≈2972
The wood is about 2970 years old.
2. An object has lost 25% of its carbon-14 when 75% of it remains.
0.75n0 = n0e−0.00012t
0.75 = e−0.00012t
−0.00012t = ln 0.75
t =
ln 0.75
−0.00012 ≈2397
After about 2400 years, an object will lose 25% of its carbon-14.
3. n(400) = n0e−0.00012(400) ≈0.953n0
About 95% of its carbon-14 remains after 400 years.

Systems of
Equations and
Inequalities
A system of equations is a collection of two or more equations whose graphs might
or might not intersect (share a common point or points). If the graphs do intersect,
then we say that the solution to the system is the point or points where the graphs
intersect. For example, the solution to the system

x + y = 4
3x −y = 0
is (1, 3) because the point (1, 3) is on both graphs. See Figure 10.1.

CHAPTER 10
Systems of Equations
263
Fig. 10.1.
We say that (1, 3) satisﬁes the system because if we let x = 1 and y = 3 in each
equation, they will both be true.
1 + 3 = 4
This is a true statement.
3(1) −3 = 0
This is a true statement.
There are several methods for solving systems of equations. One of them is by
sketching the graphs and seeing where, if anywhere, the graphs intersect. Even
with a graphing calculator, though, these solutions might only be approximations.
When the equations are lines, matrices can be used. Graphing calculators are useful
for these, too. We will use two algebraic methods in this chapter and two matrix
methods in the next. One of the algebraic methods is substitution and the other is
elimination by addition. Both methods will work with many kinds of systems of
equations, but we will start out with systems of linear equations.
Substitution works by solving for one variable in one equation and making a
substitution in the other equation. Usually, it does not matter which variable we
use or which equation we begin with, but some choices are easier than others.
EXAMPLES
Solve the systems of equations. Put your solutions in the form of a point, (x, y).
•

x + y = 5
−2x + y = −1
We have four places to start.
1.
Solve for x in the ﬁrst equation: x = 5 −y

CHAPTER 10
Systems of Equations
264
2.
Solve for y in the ﬁrst equation: y = 5 −x
3.
Solve for x in the second equation: x = 1
2 + 1
2y
4.
Solve for y in the second equation: y = 2x −1
The third option looks like it would be the most trouble, so we will use one
of the others. We will use the ﬁrst option. Because x = 5 −y came from the
ﬁrst equation, we will substitute 5 −y for x in the second equation. Then
−2x + y = −1 becomes −2(5 −y) + y = −1. Now we have one equation
with one variable.
−2(5 −y) + y = −1
−10 + 2y + y = −1
3y = 9
y = 3
Now that we know y = 3, we could use any of the equations above to ﬁnd
x. We know that x = 5 −y, so we will use this.
x = 5 −3 = 2
The solution is x = 2 and y = 3 or the point (2, 3). It is a good idea to check
the solution.
2 + 3 = 5
This is true.
−2(2) + 3 = −1
This is true.
•

4x −y = 12
A
3x + y = 2
B
We will solve for y in equation B: y = 2−3x. Next we will substitute 2−3x
for y in equation A and solve for x.
4x −y = 12
4x −(2 −3x) = 12
4x −2 + 3x = 12
7x = 14
x = 2
Nowthatweknowx = 2, wewillputx = 2inoneoftheaboveequations. We
will use y = 2 −3x: y = 2 −3(2) = −4. The solution is x = 2, y = −4, or

CHAPTER 10
Systems of Equations
265
Fig. 10.2.
(2, −4). The graphs in Figure 10.2 verify that the solution (2, −4) is on both
lines.
•



y = 4x + 1
A
y = 3x + 2
B
Both equations are already solved for y, so all we need to do is to set them
equal to each other.
A = B
4x + 1 = 3x + 2
x = 1
Use either equation A or equation B to ﬁnd y when x = 1. We will use A:
y = 4x + 1 = 4(1) + 1 = 5. The solution is x = 1 and y = 5, or (1, 5).
We can see from the graphs in Figure 10.3 that (1, 5) is the solution to the
system.
Solving a system of equations by substitution can be messy when none of the
coefﬁcients is 1. Fortunately, there is another way. We can always add the two
equations to eliminate one of the variables. Sometimes, though, we need to multiply
one or both equations by a number to make it work.

CHAPTER 10
Systems of Equations

EXAMPLE
Solve the systems of equations. Put your solutions in the form of a point, (x, y).
•
2x −3y = 16
A
5x + 3y = −2
B
Add the equations by adding like terms. Because we will be adding −3y to
3y, the y-term will cancel, leaving one equation with only one variable.
2x −3y = 16
5x + 3y = −2
7x + 0y = 14
x = 2
We can put x = 2 into either A or B to ﬁnd y. We will put x = 2 into A.
2x −3y = 16
2(2) −3y = 16
−3y = 12
y = −4
The solution is (2, −4).

CHAPTER 10
Systems of Equations
267
Sometimes we need to multiply one or both equations by some number or num-
bers so that one of the variables cancels. Multiplying both sides of any equation by
a nonzero number never changes the solution.
EXAMPLES
•

3x + 6y = −12
A
2x + 6y = −14
B
Because the coefﬁcients on y are the same, we only need to make one of
them negative. Multiply either A or B by −1, then add.
−3x −6y = 12
−A
2x + 6y = −14
+B
−x = −2
x = 2
3(2) + 6y = −12
Put x = 2 in A
y = −3
The solution is (2, −3).
•

2x + 7y = 1
A
4x −2y = 18
B
Several options will work. We could multiply A by −2 so that we could add
−4x (in −2A) to 4x in B. We could multiply A by 2 and multiply B by 7 so
that we could add 14y (in 2A) to −14y (in 7B). We could also divide B by
−2 so that we could add 2x (in A) to −2x (in −1
2B). We will add −2A + B.
−4x −14y = −2
−2A
4x −2y = 18
+B
−16y = 16
y = −1
2x + 7(−1) = 1
Put y = −1 in A
x = 4
The solution is (4, −1).
Both equations in each of the following systems will need to be changed to
eliminate one of the variables.

Applications of Systems of Equations
Systems of two linear equations can be used to solve many kinds of word problems.
In these problems, two facts will be given about two variables. Each pair of facts
can be represented by a linear equation. This gives us a system of two equations
with two variables.
EXAMPLES
•
A movie theater charges $4 for each children’s ticket and $6.50 for each
adult’s ticket. One night 200 tickets were sold, amounting to $1100 in ticket
sales. How many of each type of ticket was sold?
Let x represent the number of children’s tickets sold and y, the number of
adult tickets sold. One equation comes from the fact that a total of 200 adult
and children’s tickets were sold, giving us x + y = 200. The other equation
comes from the fact that the ticket revenue was $1100. The ticket revenue
from children’s tickets is 4x, and the ticket revenue from adult tickets is
6.50y. Their sum is 1100 giving us 4x + 6.50y = 1100.
4x + 6.50y = 1100
A
x + y = 200
B
We could use either substitution or addition to solve this system. Substitution
is a little faster. We will solve for x in B.
x = 200 −y
4(200 −y) + 6.50y = 1100
Put 200 −y into A
800 −4y + 6.50y = 1100
y = 120
x = 200 −y = 200 −120 = 80
Eighty children’s tickets were sold, and 120 adult tickets were sold.

and 20 pounds of Mineral B. How many bags of each brand should he buy?
Let x represent the number of bags of Brand I and y represent the number
of bags of Brand II. Then the number of pounds of MineralAhe will get from

of pounds of Mineral A he will get from Brand II is 20y and the number
of pounds of Mineral B is 20y. He needs 1080 pounds of Mineral A, 25x
pounds will come from Brand I and 20y will come from Brand II. This gives
us the equation 25x + 20y = 1080. He needs 920 pounds of Mineral B, 15x
will come from Brand I and 20y will come from Brand II. This gives us the
equation 15x + 20y = 920.
25x + 20y = 1080

A furniture manufacturer has some discontinued fabric and trim in stock. He
can use them on sofas and chairs. There are 160 yards of fabric and 110 yards
of trim. Each sofa takes 6 yards of fabric and 4.5 yards of trim. Each chair
takes 4 yards of fabric and 2 yards of trim. How many sofas and chairs should
be produced in order to use all the fabric and trim?
Let x represent the number of sofas to be produced and y, the number of
chairs. The manufacturer needs to use 160 yards of fabric, 6x will be used
on sofas and 4y yards on chairs. This gives us the equation 6x + 4y = 160.
There are 110 yards of trim, 4.5x yards will be used on the sofas and 2y on
the chairs. This gives us the equation 4.5x + 2y = 110.

Two lines in the plane either intersect in one point, are parallel, or are really the
same line. Until now, our lines have intersected in one point. When solving a system
of two linear equations that are parallel or are on the same line, both variables will
cancel and we are left with a true statement such as “3 = 3” or a false statement
such as “5 = 1.” We will get a true statement when the two lines are the same and
a false statement when they are parallel.

When the system of equations is not a pair of lines, there could be no solutions,
one solution, or more than one solution. The same methods used for pairs of lines
will work with other kinds of systems.

Systems of Inequalities
The solution (if any) for a system of inequalities is usually a region in the plane.
The solution to a polynomial inequality (the only kind in this book) is the region
above or below the curve. We will begin with linear inequalities.
When sketching the graph for an inequality, we will use a solid graph for “≤”
and “≥” inequalities, and a dashed graph for “<” and “>” inequalities. We can
decide which side of the graph to shade by choosing any point not on the graph
itself. We will put this point into the inequality. If it makes the inequality true,
we will shade the side that has that point. If it makes the inequality false, we
will shade the other side. Every point in the shaded region is a solution to the
inequality.
EXAMPLES
•
2x + 3y ≤6
We will sketch the line 2x +3y = 6, using a solid line because the inequality
is “≤.”
Fig. 10.6.
We will always use the origin, (0, 0) in our inequalities unless the graph
goes through the origin. Does x = 0 and y = 0 make 2x + 3y ≤6 true?
2(0) + 3(0) ≤6 is a true statement, so we will shade the side that has the
origin.

CHAPTER 10
Systems of Equations
285
Fig. 10.7.
•
x −2y > 4
We will sketch the line x −2y = 4 using a dashed line because the inequality
is “>.”
Fig. 10.8.
Now we need to decide which side of the line to shade. When we put (0, 0)
in x −2y > 4, we get the false statement 0 −2(0) > 4. We need to shade
the side of the line that does not have the origin.

CHAPTER 10
Systems of Equations
286
Fig. 10.9.
•
y < 3x
We use a dashed line to sketch the line y = 3x. Because the line goes through
(0, 0), we cannot use it to determine which side of the line to shade. This
is because any point on the line makes the equality true. We want to know
where the inequality is true. The point (1, 0) is not on the line, so we can use
it. 0 < 3(1) is true so we will shade the side of the line that has the point
(1, 0), which is the right side.
Fig. 10.10.
•
x ≥−3
The line x = −3 is a vertical line through x = −3. Because we want x ≥−3
we will shade to the right of the line.

CHAPTER 10
Systems of Equations
287
Fig. 10.11.
•
y < 2
The line y = 2 is a horizontal line at y = 2. Because we want y < 2, we
will shade below the line.
Fig. 10.12.
Graphing the solution region for nonlinear inequalities is done the same
way—graph the inequality, using a solid graph for “≤” and “≥” inequalities and
a dashed graph for “<” and “>” inequalities, then checking a point to see which
side of the graph to shade.

CHAPTER 10
Systems of Equations
288
EXAMPLES
•
y ≤x2 −x −2
The equality is y = x2 −x −2 = (x −2)(x +1). The graph for this equation
is a parabola.
Fig. 10.13.
Because (0, 0) is not on the graph, we can use it to decide which side to
shade; 0 ≤02 −0 −2 is false, so we shade below the graph, the side that
does not contain (0, 0).
Fig. 10.14.

CHAPTER 10
Systems of Equations
289
•
y > (x + 2)(x −2)(x −4)
When we check (0, 0) in the inequality, we get the false statement 0 >
(0 + 2)(0 −2)(0 −4). We will shade above the graph, the region that does
not contain (0, 0).
Fig. 10.15.
The solution (if there is one) to a system of two or more inequalities is the region
that is part of each solution for the individual inequalities. For example, if we
have a system of two inequalities and shade the solution to one inequality in blue
and the other in yellow, then the solution to the system would be the region in
green.
EXAMPLES
•

x −y < 3
x + 2y > 1
Sketch the solution for each inequality. The solution to x −y < 3 is the
region shaded vertically. The solution to x + 2y > 1 is the region shaded
horizontally.

CHAPTER 10

The region that is in both solutions is above and between the lines.

x −7y ≤4

CHAPTER 10
Systems of Equations

The solution to y ≤4 −x2 is the region shaded vertically. The solution to
x −7y ≤4 is the region shaded horizontally. The region that is in both
solutions is above the line and inside the parabola.
Fig. 10.20.
Because a solid graph indicates that points on the graph are also solutions, to
be absolutely accurate, the correct solution uses dashed graphs for the part
of the graphs that are not on the border of the shaded region.
Fig. 10.21.
We will not quibble with this technicality here.

CHAPTER 10

The inequalities x ≥0 and y ≥0 mean that we only need the top right corner
of the graph. These inequalities are common in word problems.
Fig. 10.22.
The solution to the system is the region in the top right corner of the graph
below the line 2x + y = 5.
Fig. 10.23.
Some systems of inequalities have no solution. In the following example, the
regions do not overlap, so there are no ordered pairs (points) that make both
inequalities true.

It is easy to lose track of the solution for a system of three or more inequalities.
There are a couple of things you can do to make it easier. First, make sure the
graph is large enough, using graph paper if possible. Second, shade the solution for
each inequality in a different way, with different colors or shaded with horizontal,
vertical, and slanted lines. The solution (if there is one) would be shaded all different
ways. You could also shade one region at a time, erasing the part of the previous
region that is not part of the inequality.

the shading above the line y = x.

Matrix Arithmetic
The numbers in a matrix are called cells or entries. A matrix’s size is given by the
number of rows and columns it has. For example, a matrix that has two rows and
three columns is called a 2 × 3 (pronounced “2 by 3”) matrix. A matrix that has the
same number of rows as columns is called a square matrix.
Two matrices need to be the same size before we can add them or ﬁnd their
difference. The sum of two or more matrices is the sum of their corresponding
entries.

It might seem that matrix multiplication is carried out the same way addition
and subtraction are—multiply their corresponding entries. This operation is not
very useful. The matrix multiplication operation that is useful requires more work.
Two matrices do not need to be the same size, but the number of columns of the
ﬁrst matrix must be the same as the number of rows of the second matrix. This is
because we get the entries of the product matrix by multiplying the rows of the ﬁrst
matrix by the columns of the second matrix. Here, we will multiply a 3 × 3 matrix
by a 3 × 2 matrix.

Row Operations and Inverses
We will use row operations to solve systems of equations and to ﬁnd the multiplica-
tive inverse of a matrix. These operations are similar to the elimination by addition
method studied in Chapter 10. We will add two rows at a time (or some multiple
of the rows) to make a particular entry 0. For example in the matrix
! 1 −3 2
4
1 6
"
we
might want to change the entry with a 4 in it to 0. To do so, we can multiply the
ﬁrst row (Row 1) by −4 and add it to the second row (Row 2).
−4 Row 1 = −4( 1
−3
2 ) = −4

When adding the rows together, we need the last entry in each column to be oppo-
sites. If we multiply Row 2 by −4 and Row 3 by 3, we will be adding −4(3) to
3(4) to get 0. Multiplying Row 2 by 4 and Row 3 by −3 also works.

Our ﬁrst use for row operations is to ﬁnd the inverse of a matrix (if it has one).
If we multiply a matrix by its inverse, we get the corresponding identity matrix.
For example,

CHAPTER 11

To ﬁnd the inverse of
! A B
C D
"
, we ﬁrst need to write the augmented matrix. An
augmented matrix for this method has the original matrix on the left and the identity
matrix on the right.

We will use row operations to change the left half of the matrix to the 2×2 identity
matrix. The inverse matrix will be the right half of the augmented matrix in Step 6.
Step 1
Use row operations to make the C entry a 0 for the new Row 2.
Step 2
Use row operations to make the B entry a 0 for the new Row 1.
Step 3
Write the next matrix.
Step 4
Divide Row 1 by the A entry.
Step 5
Divide Row 2 by the D entry.
Step 6
Write the new matrix. The inverse matrix will be the right half of this
matrix.

We will use row operations to turn the left half of the augmented matrix into the
3 × 3 identity matrix. There are many methods for getting from the ﬁrst matrix to
the last. The method outlined below will always work, assuming the matrix has an
inverse.
Step 1
Use Row 1 and Row 2 to make the D entry to 0 for new Row 2.
Step 2
Use Row 1 and Row 3 to make the G entry to 0 for new Row 3.
Step 3
Write the next matrix.

Step 4

Step 6
Write the next matrix.

Step 7
Use Row 1 and Row 3 to make the C entry a 0 for new Row 1.
Step 8
Use Row 2 and Row 3 to make the F entry a 0 for new Row 2.
Step 9
Write the next matrix.
 New Row 1

Step 10 Divide Row 1 by A, Row 2 by E, and Row 3 by I. The inverse is the right
half of the augmented matrix.

Matrices and Systems of Equations
There are three ways we can use matrices to solve a system of linear equations. Two
of them will be discussed in this book. Solving systems using these methods will be
very much like ﬁnding inverses. We will begin with 2 × 2 systems (two equations
and two variables) and an augmented matrix of the form

A B | E
C D | F

. A, B, C, and
D are the coefﬁcients of x and y in the equations and E and F are the constant
terms. We will use the same steps above to change this matrix to one of the form

1 0 | number
0 1 | number

. The numbers in the last column will be the solution.
EXAMPLE
•

2x −3y = 17
−x + y = −7
The coefﬁcients 2, −3, −1, and 1 are the entries in the left side of the matrix.
The constant terms 17 and −7 are the entries on the right side of the matrix.
The augmented matrix is

2 −3 |
17
−1
1 | −7

.

The solution is x = 4 and y = −3.
Begin solving a 3×3 system (three equations and three variables) by writing
the augmented matrix
 A B C | J
D E F | K
G H I | L

. Using the same steps we used to ﬁnd
the inverse of a matrix, we want to change this matrix to one of the form
 1 0 0 | number

0 0 1 | number

. The numbers in the fourth column will be the solution.

The second method we will use to solve systems of equations involves ﬁnding
the inverse of a matrix and multiplying two matrices. We begin by creating
the coefﬁcient matrix and the constant matrix for the system.

Ax + By = E
Cx + Dy = F
The coefﬁcient matrix is
! A B
C D
"
and the constant matrix is
! E
F
"
. We will ﬁnd
the inverse of the coefﬁcient matrix and multiply the inverse by the constant
matrix. The product matrix will consist of one column of two numbers. These
two numbers will be the solution to the system.

The last computation we will learn is ﬁnding a matrix’s determinant. Although
we will not use the determinant here, it is used in vector mathematics courses, some
theoretical algebra courses, and in algebra courses that cover Cramer’s Rule (used
to solve systems of linear equations). An interesting fact about determinants is that
a square matrix has an inverse only when its determinant is a nonzero number.
The usual notation for a determinant is to enclose the matrix using two vertical
bars instead of two brackets. The determinant for the matrix

We ﬁnd the determinant of larger matrices by breaking down the larger matrix
into several 2 × 2 sub-matrices. For larger matrices, there are numerous for-
mulas for computing their determinants. Some of them come from expanding
the matrix along each row and along each column. This means that we will
multiply the entries in a row or a column by the determinant of a smaller
matrix. This smaller matrix comes from deleting the row and column an
entry is in. When working with a 3 × 3 matrix, these sub-matrices will be
2 × 2 matrices.
Suppose we want to expand the following matrix along the ﬁrst row.

CHAPTER
Conic Sections
Aconic section is a shape obtained when a cone is sliced. The study of conic sections
began over two thousand years ago and we use their properties today. Planets in our
solar system move around the sun in elliptical orbits. The cross-section of many
reﬂecting surfaces is in the shape of a parabola. In fact, all of the conic sections
haveusefulreﬂectingproperties. Therearethreeconicsections—parabolas, ellipses
(including circles), and hyperbolas.
Parabolas
In Chapter 6, we learned how to graph parabolas when their equations were in the
form y = a(x −h)2 + k or y = ax2 + bx + c. Now we will learn the formal
deﬁnition for a parabola and another form for its equation.
DEFINITION: A parabola is the set of all points whose distance to a ﬁxed point
and a ﬁxed line are the same.
The ﬁxed point is the focus. The ﬁxed line is the directrix. For example, the focus
for the parabola y = −1
2x2 −3x + 2 is (−3, 6), and the directrix is the horizontal
line y = 7. The point (0, 2) is on the parabola. Its distance from the line y = 7 is 5.

The new form for a parabola that opens up or down is (x −h)2 = 4p(y −k).
The vertex is still at (h, k), but p helps us to ﬁnd the focus and the equation for
the directrix. The focus is the point (h, k + p), and the directrix is the horizontal
line y = k −p. The form for the equation for a parabola that opens to the side is
(y −k)2 = 4p(x −h). The focus for a parabola that opens to the right or to the
left is the point (h + p, k), and the directrix is the vertical line x = h −p. This
information is summarized in Table 12.1 and in Figures 12.1 and 12.2.
Table 12.1
(x −h)2 = 4p(y −k)
(y −k)2 = 4p(x −h)
The vertex is (h, k).
The vertex is (h, k).
The parabola opens up if p is positive
The parabola opens to the right if p is positive
and down if p is negative.
and to the left if p is negative.
The focus is (h, k + p).
The focus is (h + p, k).
The directrix is y = k −p.
The directrix is x = h −p.
The axis of symmetry is x = h.
The axis of symmetry is y = k.

CHAPTER 12

Fig. 12.2.
In the following examples, we will be asked to match the equation to its graph.
The vertex for each parabola will be at (0, 0). We can decide which graph goes
to which equation either by ﬁnding the focus or the directrix in the equation and
ﬁnding which graph has this focus or directrix.
EXAMPLES
Match the graphs in Figures 12.3 through 12.6 with their equations.

•
x2 = 6y
The equation is in the form (x −h)2 = 4p(y −k), so the parabola will
open up or down. We have p = 3
2 (from 6 = 4p). Now we know three
things—that the parabola opens up (because p is positive), that the focus
is (h, k + p) = (0, 0 + 3
2) = (0, 3
2), and the directrix is y = −3
2 (from
k −p = 0 −3
2). The graph that behaves this way is in Figure 12.5.
•
y2 = 6x
The equation is in the form (y −k)2 = 4p(x −h), so the parabola opens to
the left or to the right. We have p = 3
2 (from 6 = 4p). Now we know that the
parabola opens to the right, that the focus is (h+p, k) = (0+ 3
2, 0) = (3
2, 0),
and that the directrix is x = −3
2 (from h −p = 0 −3
2). The graph for this
equation is in Figure 12.3.
•
y2 = −6x
The equation is in the form (y −k)2 = 4p(x −h), so the parabola opens
to the left or to the right. We have p = −3
2 (from −6 = 4p). The parabola
opens to the left, the focus is (h + p, k) = (0 + −3
2, 0) = (−3
2, 0), and the
directrix is x = 3
2 (from h −p = 0 −(−3
2)). The graph for this equation is
in Figure 12.4.
•
x2 = −6y
The equation is in the form (x −h)2 = 4p(y −k), so the parabola opens up
or down. We have p = −3
2 (from −6 = 4p). The parabola opens down, the
focus is (h, k +p) = (0, 0+(−3
2)) = (0, −3
2). The directrix is y = 3
2 (from
k −p = 0 −(−3
2)). The graph for this equation is in Figure 12.6.

CHAPTER 12
Conic Sections
334
Using the information in Table 12.1, we can ﬁnd the vertex, focus, directrix, and
whether the parabola opens up, down, to the left, or to the right by looking at its
equation.
EXAMPLES
Find the vertex, focus, and directrix. Determine if the parabola opens up, down, to
the left, or to the right.
•
(x −3)2 = 4(y −2)
This equation is in the form (x −h)2 = 4p(y −k). The vertex is (3, 2). Once
we have found p, we can ﬁnd the focus and directrix and how the parabola
opens. p = 1 (from 4 = 4p). The parabola opens up because p is positive;
the focus is (h, k +p) = (3, 2+1) = (3, 3); and the directrix is y = 1 (from
y = k −p = 2 −1 = 1).
•
(y + 1)2 = 8(x −3)
Theequationisintheform (y−k)2 = 4p(x−h). Thevertexis(3, −1), p = 2
(from 8 = 4p); the parabola opens to the right; the focus is (h + p, k) =
(3+2, −1) = (5, −1); and the directrix is x = 1 (from x = h−p = 3−2 = 1).
If we know any two of the vertex, focus, and directrix, we can ﬁnd an equation
of the parabola. From the information given, we ﬁrst need to decide which form
to use. Knowing the directrix is the fastest way to decide this. If the directrix is a
horizontal line (y = number), then the equation is (x −h)2 = 4p(y −k). If the
directrix is a vertical line (x = number), then the equation is (y −k)2 = 4p(x −h).
If we do not have the directrix, we need to look at the coordinates of the vertex and
focus. Either both the x-coordinates will be the same or both y-coordinates will be.
If both x-coordinates are the same, the parabola opens up or down. We need to use
the form (x −h)2 = 4p(y −k). If both y-coordinates are the same, the parabola
opens to the side. We need to use the form (y −k)2 = 4p(x −h). Once we have
decided which form to use, we might need to use algebra to ﬁnd h, k, and p. For
example, if we know the focus is (2, −1) and the directrix is x = 6, then we know
h −p = 6 and h + p = 2 and k = −1. The equations h −p = 6 and h + p = 2
form a system of equations.
h −p = 6
h + p = 2
2h = 8

CHAPTER 12
Conic Sections
335
h = 4
4 −p = 6
Let h = 4 in h −p = 6
p = −2
Now that we have all three numbers and the form, we are ready to write the
equation: (y + 1)2 = −8(x −4).
EXAMPLES
Find an equation for the parabola.
•
The directrix is y = 2, and the vertex is (3, 1).
Because the directrix is a horizontal line,
the equation we want is
(x −h)2 = 4p(y −k). The vertex is (3, 1), giving us h = 3 and k = 1. From
y = k −p and y = 2, we have 1 −p = 2, making p = −1. The equation is
(x −3)2 = −4(y −1).
•
The focus is (4, −2), and the vertex is (0, −2).
The y-coordinates are the same, so this parabola opens to the side, and the
equation we need is (y −k)2 = 4p(x −h). The vertex is (h, k) = (0, −2),
giving us h = 0 and k = −2. The focus is (h + p, k) = (4, −2). From this
we have h+p = 0+p = 4, making p = 4. The equation is (y +2)2 = 16x.
•
Fig. 12.7.
The directrix is the vertical line x = −1, and the focus is (3, 2). Because
the parabola opens to the right, the form we need is (y −k)2 = 4p(x −h).

CHAPTER 12
Conic Sections
336
From the focus we have (h + p, k) = (3, 2), so h + p = 3 and k = 2. The
directrix is x = −1 and x = h −p so h −p = −1.
h −p = −1
h + p = 3
2h = 2
h = 1
1 + p = 3
Let h = 1 in h + p = 3
p = 2
The equation is (y −2)2 = 8(x −1).

1. Identify the vertex, focus, and directrix for (y −5)2 = 10(x −1).
2. Identify the vertex, focus, and directrix for (x + 6)2 = −1
2(y −4).
3. Find an equation for the parabola that has directrix y = −2 and focus
(4, 10).

Ellipses
Most ellipses look like ﬂattened circles. Usually one diameter is longer than the
other. In Figure 12.11, the horizontal diameter is longer than the vertical diameter.
In Figure 12.12 the vertical diameter is longer than the horizontal diameter. The
longer diameter is the major axis, and the shorter diameter is the minor axis. An
ellipse has seven important points—the center, two endpoints of the major axis
(the vertices), two endpoints of the minor axis, and two points along the major
axis called the foci (plural for focus). When the equation of an ellipse is in the form

In the next set of problems, we will be given an equation for an ellipse. From
the equation, we can ﬁnd h, k, a, and b. With these numbers and the information
in Figures 12.11 or 12.12 we can ﬁnd the center, foci, and vertices.

From the equation, we see that h = 3, k = −5, a2 and b2 are 42 and 52, but
which is a and which is b? a needs to be the larger number, so a = 5 and
b = 4. This makes c =

25 −16 = 3. We need to use the
information in Figure 12.12 because the larger denominator is under (y−k)2.
Center: (h, k) = (3, −5)
Foci: (h, k −c) = (3, −5 −3) = (3, −8) and (h, k + c) = (3, −5 + 3) =
(3, −2)

Now that we can ﬁnd this important information from an equation of an ellipse,
we are ready to match graphs of ellipses to their equations.
EXAMPLES
Match the equations with the graphs in Figures 12.14–12.16.

The larger denominator is under y2, so we need to use the information in

(0, 3) and (0, −3). This graph is in Figure 12.15.

The larger denominator is under x2, so we need to use the information in

is in Figure 12.16.
•
x2 + y2
4 = 1
The larger denominator is under y2, so we need to use the information in
Figure 12.12. Because a = 2, the vertices are (0, 2) and (0, −2). This graph
is in Figure 12.14.
With as little as three points, we can ﬁnd an equation of an ellipse. Using
the formulas in Figures 12.11 and 12.12 and some algebra, we can ﬁnd h, k, a,
and b.
EXAMPLES
Find an equation of the ellipse.
•
The vertices are (−4, 2) and (6, 2), and (1, 5) is a point on the graph.
The y-coordinates are the same, so the major axis (the larger diameter) is
horizontal, which means we need to use the information in Figure 12.11. The
vertices are (h −a, k) and (h + a, k). This means that h −a = −4 and
h + a = 6, and k = 2.
h −a = −4
h + a = 6
2h = 2
h = 1
1 −a = −4
Let h = 1 in h −a = −4
a = 5

•
The foci are (−4, −10) and (−4, 14) and (−4, 15) is a vertex.
The x-values of foci are the same, so the major axis is vertical. This tells us
that we need to use the information in Figure 12.12.
(h, k −c) = (−4, −10) and (h, k +c) = (−4, 14), so h = −4, k −c = −10
and k + c = 14.
k −c = −10
k + c = 14
2k = 4
k = 2
2 −c = −10
Let k = 2 in k −c = −10
c = 12
Because (−4, 15) is a vertex, k + a = 15, so 2 + a = 15 and a = 13. All
we need to ﬁnish is to ﬁnd b. Let a = 13 and c = 12 in c =

The eccentricity of an ellipse is a number that measures how ﬂat it is. The formula
is e = c
a. This number ranges between 0 and 1. The closer to 1 the eccentricity of
an ellipse is, the ﬂatter it is. If e = c
a = 0, then the ellipse is a circle. In a circle,
the center and foci are all the same point, and a and b are the same number. For
example, (x−5)2
9
+ (y−4)2

√
9 = 3.
Usually we see equations of circles in the form (x −h)2 + (y −k)2 = r2.

Hyperbolas
The last conic section is the hyperbola. Hyperbolas are formed when a slice is made
through both parts of a double cone. The graph of a hyperbola comes in two pieces
called branches. Like ellipses, hyperbolas have a center, two foci, and two vertices.
Hyperbolas also have two slant asymptotes. The deﬁnition of a hyperbola involves
the distance between points on the graph and two ﬁxed points.
DEFINITION: A hyperbola is the set of all points such that the difference of the
distance between a point and two ﬁxed points (the foci) is constant.
For example, the foci for x2
9 −y2
16 = 1 are (−5, 0) and (5, 0). For any point on
the hyperbola, the distance between this point and one focus minus the distance
between the same point and the other focus is 6. Two points on the hyperbola are
(6,
√
48) and (12,
√
240).

If the x2 term is positive, one branch opens to the left and the other to the right. If
the y2 term is positive, one branch opens up and the other down. The formulas for
these two forms are in Figures 12.21 and 12.22.

We can sketch a hyperbola by plotting the vertices and sketching the asymptotes,
using dashed lines. We should also plot two points to the left and two points to the
right of the vertices.
EXAMPLE
•
Sketch the graph for y2
4 −x2 = 1.
Because y2 is positive, we will use the information in Figure 12.22. The
center is (0, 0), a = 2, and b = 1. The vertices are (h, k +a) = (0, 0+2) =
(0, 2) and (h, k −a) = (0, 0 −2) = (0, −2). The asymptote formulas are
y = k−a
b(x−h) and y = k+ a
b(x−h). Using our numbers for h, k, a, and b,
we have y = −2x and y = 2x. We will use x = 4 and x = −4 for our extra
points. If we let x = 4 or x = −4, we get two y-values, ±
√
68. These give
us four more points—(4,
√
68), (4, −
√
68), (−4,

68), and (−4, −

68).

In the next problem, we will ﬁnd the center, vertices, foci, and asymptotes
for given hyperbolas. Once we have determined whether x2 is positive or y2
is positive, we can decide on which formulas to use, those in Figure 12.21 or
Figure 12.22.

In the next problem, we will match equations of hyperbolas with their graphs.
Being able to identify the vertices will not be enough. We will also need to use the
equations of the asymptotes to ﬁnd b (we will know a from the vertices). Because
the center of each hyperbola will be at (0, 0), the asymptotes will either be y = a

We can ﬁnd the equation for a hyperbola when we know some points or a point
and the asymptotes. If we have the vertices and foci, then ﬁnding an equation for
a hyperbola will be similar to ﬁnding an equation for an ellipse. If we are given
the vertices and asymptotes or foci and asymptotes, we will need to use the slope
of one of the asymptotes to ﬁnd either a or b (we will know one but not the other
from the vertices or foci). The ﬁrst thing we need to decide is which formulas

to use—those in Figures 12.21 or Figure 12.22. If the vertices or foci are on the
same horizontal line (the y-coordinates are the same), we will use Figure 12.21.
If they are on the same vertical line (the x-coordinates are the same), we will use
Figure 12.22.

In order to use a graphing calculator to graph a conic section, the equation
probably needs to be entered as two separate functions. For example, the graph of
y2 = x could be entered as y = √x and y = −√x. To use a graphing calculator
to graph a conic section that is not a function, solve for y. When taking the square
root of both sides, we use a “±” symbol on one of the sides. It is this sign that gives
us two separate equations.

Equations of conic sections do not always come in the convenient forms we have
been using. Sometimes they come in the general form Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx +
Ey + F = 0. When A and C are equal (and B = 0), the graph is a circle. If A
and C are positive and not equal (and B = 0), the graph is an ellipse. If A and C
have different signs (and B = 0), the graph is a hyperbola. If only one of A or C
is nonzero (and B = 0), the graph is a parabola. There are some conic sections
whose entire graph is one point. These are called degenerate conics. We can rewrite

Because there is no y2 term, the graph of this equation is a parabola that
opens up or down. The standard equation is (x −h)2 = 4p(y −k). We need
to have the x terms on one side of the equation and the other terms on the
other side.

Trigonometry
Trigonometry has been used for over two thousand years to solve many real-
world problems, among them surveying, navigating, and problems in engineering.
Another important use is analytic—the trigonometric functions and their graphs are
important in several mathematics courses. The unit circle is the basis of analytic
trigonometry. The unit circle is the circle centered at the origin that has radius 1.
See Figure 13.1.
Angles have two sides, the initial side and the terminal side. On the unit circle,
the initial side is the positive part of the x-axis. The terminal side is the side that
rotates. See Figure 13.2
A positive angle rotates counterclockwise, ↶. A negative angle rotates
clockwise, ↷. Angles on the unit circle are often measured in radians. Radian
measure is based on the circumference of the unit circle, C = 2πr. The radius is
1, so 2πr = 2π. An angle that rotates all the way around the circle is 2π radians,
half-way around is π radians, one-third the way is 1
3(2π) = 2π
3 radians, and so on.
The relationship 2π radians = 360◦gives us two equations.

These equations help us to convert radian measure to degrees and degree measure
to radians. We can convert radians to degrees by multiplying the angle by 180/π.
We can convert degrees to radians by multiplying the angle by π/180.

Two angles are coterminal if their terminal sides are the same. For example, the
terminal sides of the angles 300◦and −60◦are the same. See Figure 13.3.
Fig. 13.3.
Two angles are coterminal if their difference is a multiple of 360◦or 2π radians.
In the example above, the difference of 300◦and −60◦is 300◦−(−60◦) = 360◦.
EXAMPLES
Determine whether or not the angles are coterminal.
•
18◦and 738◦
Is the difference between 18◦and 738◦a multiple of 360? 738◦−18◦= 720◦,
720◦= 2 · 360◦, so the angles are coterminal.
•
−170◦and 350◦
350◦−(−170◦) = 350◦+ 170◦= 520◦and 520◦is not a multiple of 360◦,
so the angles are not coterminal.

Every angle, θ (the Greek letter theta), has a reference angle, ¯θ, associated with
it. The reference angle is the smallest angle between the terminal side of the angle
and the x-axis. A reference angle will be between 0 and π/2 radians, or 0◦and 90◦.
The reference angle for all of the angles shown in Figures 13.4 through 13.7 is π

The xy plane is divided into four quadrants. The trigonometric functions of
angles in the different quadrants will have different signs. It is important to be
familiar with the signs of the trigonometric functions in the different quadrants.
One reason is that formulas have ± signs in them, and the sign of + or −depends
on the quadrant in which the angle lies. Before we ﬁnd reference angles, we will
become familiar with the quadrants in the xy plane. (see Figure 13.8.)
EXAMPLES
Determine the quadrant in which the point lies.
•
(5, −3)
x = 5 is positive, and y = −3 is negative, the point is in Quadrant IV.

CHAPTER 13

•
(4, 7)
Both x = 4 and y = 7 are positive, the point is in Quadrant I.
•

Both x = −1 and y = −6 are negative, the point is in Quadrant III.
•
(−2, 10)
x = −2 is negative, y = 10 is positive, the point is in Quadrant II.
Below is an outline for ﬁnding the reference angle.
1.
If the angle is not between 0 radians and 2π radians, ﬁnd an angle between
thesetwoanglesbyaddingorsubtractingamultipleof2π. Callthis angleθ.
2.
If θ is Quadrant I, θ is its own reference angle.
3.
If θ is in Quadrant II, the reference angle is π −θ.
4.
If θ is in Quadrant III, the reference angle is θ −π.
5.
If θ is in Quadrant IV, the reference angle is 2π −θ.
EXAMPLES
Find the reference angle.
•
θ = 9π
8
This angle is in Quadrant III (bigger than π but smaller than 3π/2),
so ¯θ = 9π/8 −π = π/8.

CHAPTER 13
Trigonometry
369
•
θ = 7π
3
This angle is not between 0 and 2π, so we need to add or subtract some
multiple of 2π so that we do have an angle between 0 and 2π. The coterminal
angle we need is 7π/3−2π = 7π/3−6π/3 = π/3, π/3 is its own reference
angle because it is in Quadrant I, so ¯θ = π/3.
•
θ = 5π
7
This angle is in Quadrant II (between π/2 and π), so ¯θ = π −5π/7 =
7π/7 −5π/7 = 2π/7.
•
θ = −2π
3
This angle is not between 0 and 2π. It is coterminal with 2π + (−2π/3) =
6π/3 −2π/3 = 4π/3. The angles are in Quadrant III, so ¯θ = 4π/3 −π =
4π/3 −3π/3 = π/3.
There are six trigonometric functions, but four of them are written in terms of two
of the main functions—sine and cosine. Although trigonometry was developed to
solve problems involving triangles, there is a very close relationship between sine
and cosine and the unit circle. Suppose an angle θ is given. The x-coordinate of the
point on the unit circle for θ is cosine of the angle (written cos θ). The y-coordinate
of the point is sine of the angle (written sin θ). For example, suppose the point
determined by the angle θ is (3/5, 4/5). Then cos θ = 3/5 and sin θ = 4/5. See
Figure 13.9.

The equation for the unit circle is x2 + y2 = 1. For an angle θ, we can replace
x with cos θ and y with sin θ. This changes the equation to cos2 θ + sin2 θ = 1
(cos2 θ means (cos θ)2 and sin2 θ means (sin θ)2). This is an important equation.
It allows us to ﬁnd cos θ if we know sin θ and sin θ if we know cos θ. Solving
this equation for cos θ gives us cos θ = ±

Sine and cosine can be evaluated at any angle. This is not true for the other
trigonometric functions. For example tan π/2 = sin π/2/cos π/2 and sec π/2 =
1/cos π/2 are not deﬁned because cos π/2 = 0. We can ﬁnd all six trigonometric
functions for an angle θ if we either know both coordinates of its terminal point or
if we know one coordinate and the quadrant where θ lies.
Before we begin the next set of problems, we will review a shortcut that will
save some computation for tan θ. A compound fraction of the form (a/b)/(c/b)
simpliﬁes to a/c.

The graph of a trigonometric function is a record of each cycle around the unit
circle. For the function f (x) = sin x, x is the angle and f (x) is the y-coordinate of
the terminal point determined by the angle x. In the function g(x) = cos x, g(x) is
the x-coordinate of the terminal point determined by the angle x. For example, the
point determined by the angle π/6 is (

and g(π/6) = cos π/6 =

The graph in Figure 13.13 is two periods from the entire graph. This pattern
repeats itself in both directions. Each period begins and ends at every multiple of
2π: . . . , [−2π, 0], [0, 2π], [2π, 4π], . . .. The graph between 0 and 2π represents
sine on the ﬁrst positive cycle around the unit circle, between 2π and 4π represents
the second positive cycle, and between 0 and −2π represents the ﬁrst negative
cycle.
The graph for g(x) = cos x behaves in the same way. In fact, the graph of g(x) is
the graph of f (x) shifted horizontally π/2 units. (We will see why this is true when
we work with right triangles.) The graph for g(x) = cos x is shown in Figure 13.14.
Fig. 13.14.
From their graphs, we can tell that f (x) = sin x is an odd function (sin(−x) =
−sin x), and g(x) = cos x is even (cos(−x) = cos x). We can also see that their
domain is all x and their range is all y values between −1 and 1.
The graphs of f (x) = sin x and g(x) = cos x can be shifted up or down, left
or right, and stretched or compressed in the same way as other graphs. The graphs

of y = c + sin x and y = c + cos x are shifted up or down c units. The graphs of
y = a sin x and y = a cos x are vertically stretched or compressed, and the graphs
of y = sin(x −b) and y = cos(x −b) are shifted horizontally by b units.

The dashed graph in Figures 13.15 through 13.18 is one period of the graph of

y = 3 sin(x + π/3)
The graph of this function is vertically stretched by a factor of 3, so we will
look for a graph whose y values lie between −3 and 3. The graph will also
be shifted to the left by π/3 units. The graph for this function is shown in
Figure 13.16.

it is shifted to the right by π/6 units. The graph for this function is shown in
Figure 13.18.

y = 1
2 sin(x + π/2)
The graph of this function is vertically compressed by a factor of 1/2, so we
will look for a graph whose y values are between −1/2 and 1/2. The graph
will also be shifted to the left by π/2 units. The graph for this function is
shown in Figure 13.17.
•
y = 2 sin(x −π/4)
The graph of this function is vertically stretched by a factor of 2, so we will
look for a graph whose y values are between −2 and 2. It will also be shifted
to the right π/4 units. The graph for this function is shown in Figure 13.15.
Transformations of the graphs of sine and cosine have names. The amplitude is
the degree of vertical stretching or compressing. The horizontal shift is called the
phase shift. Horizontal stretching or compressing changes the length of the period.
For functions of the form y = a sin k(x −b) and y = a cos k(x −b), |a| is the
graph’s amplitude, b is its phase shift, and 2π/k is its period.
EXAMPLES
Find the amplitude, period, and phase shift.

Sketching the Graphs of Sine and Cosine
We can sketch one period of the graphs of sine and cosine or any of their transfor-
mations by plotting ﬁve key points. These points for y = sin x and y = cos x are
x = 0, π/2, π, 3π/2 and 2π. These points are the x-intercepts and the vertices

these points are shifted to b, b + π

Because csc x = 1/ sin x, the graph of y = csc x has a vertical asymptote every-
where y = sin x has an x-intercept (where sin x = 0). Because sec x = 1/ cos x,
the graph of y = sec x has a vertical asymptote everywhere y = cos x has an
x-intercept. The period for y = csc x and y = sec x is 2π. The graph for y = csc x

y = sin x is an odd function, y = csc x is also an odd function. Because y = cos x

The period for the functions y = tan x and y = cot x is π instead of 2π as it is
with the other trigonometric functions. These graphs also have vertical asymptotes.

y = cos x. The graph of y = cot x (= cos x/ sin x) has a vertical asymptote at each
zero of y = sin x. The graph of y = tan x is shown in Figure 13.32, and the graph
of y = cot x is shown in Figure 13.33.

The transformations of these are similar to those of the other trigonometric
functions. For functions of the form y = a csc k(x −b) and y = a sec k(x −b), the
period is 2π/k, and the phase shift is b. For functions of the form y = a tan k(x−b)
and y = a cot k(x −b), the period is π/k, and the phase shift is b. The term
amplitude only applies to the sine and cosine functions.
Right Triangle Trigonometry
Using trigonometry to solve triangles is one of the oldest forms of mathematics.
One of its most powerful uses is to measure distances—the height of a tree or
building, the distance between earth and the moon, or the dimensions of a plot of
land. The trigonometric ratios below are the same as before with the unit circle,
only the labels are different. We will begin with right triangles.
In a right triangle, one angle measures 90◦and the sum of the other angles is
also 90◦. The side opposite the 90◦angle is the hypotenuse. The other sides are the
legs. If we let θ represent one of the acute angles, then one of the legs is the side
opposite θ, and the other side is adjacent to θ. See Figure 13.34.

The hypotenuse is 13, the side opposite ∠A is 5, so sin A = 5/13. The
side adjacent to ∠B is 5, so cos B = 5/13. The other ratios are sec A =
13/12, csc B = 13/12, tan A = 5/12, and cot B = 5/12.
The side opposite ∠A is the side adjacent to ∠B, and the side adjacent to ∠A
is opposite ∠B. This is why sine and cosine, secant and cosecant, and tangent and
cotangent are co-functions. Because ∠A + ∠B = 90◦, we have ∠B = 90◦−∠A.
These facts give us the following important relationships.
sin A = cos B = cos(90◦−A)
cos A = sin B = sin(90◦−A)
tan A = cot B = cot(90◦−A)
csc A = sec B = sec(90◦−A)
sec A = csc B = csc(90◦−A)
cot A = tan B = tan(90◦−A)
To “solve a triangle” means to ﬁnd all three angles and the lengths of all three
sides. For now, we will solve right triangles. Later, after covering inverse trigono-
metric functions, we can solve other triangles. When solving right triangles, we
will use the Pythagorean Theorem as well as the fact that the sum of the two acute
angles is 90◦. Except for the angles 30◦, 45◦, and 60◦, we need a calculator. The
calculator should be in degree mode. Also, there are probably no keys for secant,
cosecant, and cotangent. You will need to use the reciprocal key, marked either 1
x or
x−1. The keys marked sin−1, cos−1, and tan−1 are used to evaluate the functions
covered in the next section.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Only one-to-one functions can have inverses, and the trigonometric functions are
certainly not one to one. But we can limit their domains and force them to be one
to one. Limiting the sine function to the interval from x = −π/2 to x = π/2
makes f (x) = sin x one to one. The graph in Figure 13.44 passes the Horizontal
Line Test.
The domain of this function is [−π/2, π/2], and the range is [−1, 1]. If we limit
the cosine function to the interval from x = 0 to x = π, we have another one-to-one
function. Its graph is shown in Figure 13.45. The domain of this function is [0, π]
and the range is [−1, 1].
By limiting the tangent function from x = −π/2 to x = π/2, f (x) = tan x is
one to one. Its domain is (−π/2, π/2), and its range is all real numbers.

There are two notations for inverse trigonometric functions. One uses “−1,”
and the other uses the letters arc. For example, the inverse sine function is noted
as sin−1 or arcsin. Remember that for any function f (x) and its inverse f −1(x),
f (f −1(x)) = x and f −1(f (x)) = x. In other words, a function evaluated at its
inverse “cancels” itself.
cos−1(cos π/3) = π/3
sin(sin−1 1/4) = 1/4
tan(tan−1 1) = 1
tan−1(tan θ) = θ
The x and y values are reversed for inverse functions. For example, if (4, 9) is a
point on the graph of f (x), then (9, 4) is a point on the graph of f −1(x). This
means that the y-values for the inverse trigonometric functions are angles. Though
we will need to use a calculator to evaluate most of these functions, we can ﬁnd a
few of them without a calculator. For cos−1 1

2 = π
3 . When evaluat-
ing inverse trigonometric functions, we need to keep in mind what their range is.
The domain of f (x) = sin(x) is [−π/2, π/2] (Quadrants I and IV), so the range of
y = sin−1 x is [−π/2, π/2]. The domain of f (x) = cos x is [0, π], so the range of
y = cos−1 x is [0, π] (Quadrants I and II). And the domain of f (x) = tan x
is (−π/2, π, 2), so the range of y = tan−1 x is (−π/2, π/2) (Quadrants I
and IV).

In the next set of problems, we will use right triangles to ﬁnd the exact value
of expressions like cos(sin−1 2/3). We will begin by letting sin−1 2/3 = θ. We
can think of sin−1 2/3 = θ as sin θ = 2/3. This allows us to use (Opposite/
Hypotenuse) to represent 2/3. We will create a right triangle with acute angle θ,
where the side opposite θ is 2, and the hypotenuse is 3.

CHAPTER 13
Trigonometry

Fig. 13.47.
We want cos θ. We have the hypotenuse. We will use the Pythagorean Theorem
to ﬁnd x: x2 + 22 = 32. This gives us x =
√
5 and cos θ =
√
5/3. Now we have
cos(sin−1 2/3) = cos θ =
√
5/3.
EXAMPLE
•
sin(tan−1 4/5)
Let tan−1 4/5 = θ, so tan θ = 4/5. We want a right triangle where the side
opposite θ is 4 and the side adjacent to θ is 5.

We will use inverse trigonometric functions to solve right triangles when we are
given one acute angle and the length of one side. We can also use them to solve
right triangles when we only have the lengths of two sides.

We can solve other triangles using inverse trigonometric functions and the Law
of Sines and/or the Law of Cosines.Although all triangles can be solved, sometimes
we are given information that is true about more than one triangle or about a triangle
that cannot exist. In the following problems, we will use the labels in the following
triangles.

CHAPTER 13
Trigonometry
399
Fig. 13.55.
Fig. 13.56.
The angles are A, B, and C. The sides opposite these angles are a, b, and c,
respectively.
We cannot solve a triangle if all we know are all three angles. Two triangles
can be different sizes but have the same angles. Also, we might be given an angle
with the side opposite the angle and another side that makes two triangles true. For
example, suppose we are told to ﬁnd a triangle where ∠A = 21◦, a = 3, and
b = 8. There are two triangles that satisfy these conditions.
Triangle 1
Triangle 2
∠A = 21◦
∠A = 21◦
∠B ≈72.9◦
∠B ≈107.1◦
∠C ≈86.1◦
∠C ≈52◦
a = 3
a = 3
b = 8
b = 8
c ≈8.4
c ≈6.6
There are two triangles when b sin A < a < b. If we have another number in
addition to A, a, and b, then there will only be one triangle.
As an example of a triangle that cannot exist, let ∠A = 20◦, b = 10, and a = 2.
As you can see in Figure 13.57, a is too short to close the triangle. This happens
when a < b sin A.

CHAPTER 13
Trigonometry

Fig. 13.57.
We can use the Law of Sines to solve a triangle if we know two sides and one
of the angles opposite these sides or two angles and one side (if we know two
angles, then we know all three because their sum is 180◦). If do not have this
information, the Law of Cosines works. We can use the Law of Cosines when we
have two sides and any angle or when we have all three sides.
Here is the Law of Sines.

Sequences and Series
A sequence is an ordered list of numbers. Although they list the same numbers, the
sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . is different from the sequence 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, . . ..
Usually a sequence is inﬁnite. This means that there is no last term in the sequence.
Aseries is the sum (if it exists) of a sequence. Although a sequence can be any list of
numbers, we will work with sequences that can be found from a formula. Formulas
describe how to compute the nth term, an. For example, the formula an = 2n + 1
gives us this sequence.

Finding the terms of a sequence is the same function evaluation we did
earlier. Sequences are special kinds of functions whose domain is the natural
numbers (instead of intervals of real numbers).
We can write the formulas for many sequences using the previous term. For
example, the next term of the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, . . . can be found by adding 2 to
the previous term. In other words, we could use the formula an = an−1 +2. This is
a recursive formula. This formula is not of much use unless we know how to start.
For this reason, the value of a1 is usually given with recursively deﬁned sequences.
A complete recursive deﬁnition for this sequence is an = an−1 + 2, a1 = 3. Now
we can compute the terms of the sequence.

A famous recursively deﬁned sequence is the Fibonacci Sequence. Entire books
are written about it! The nth term of the Fibonacci Sequence is an = an−1 + an−2
and a1 = 1 and a2 = 1. From the third term on, each term is the sum of the previous
two terms. The ﬁrst few terms are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . ..
Instead of using a formula to describe a sequence, we might be given the ﬁrst
few terms. From these terms we should be able to see enough of a pattern to write
a formula for the nth term.

If we want the signs to alternate, we can use the factor (−1)n (if we want
the odd-numbered terms to be negative) or (−1)n+1 (if we want the even-

There are times when we want to add the ﬁrst n terms of a sequence. The sum

is called the nth partial sum of the sequence. Its notation is Sn.
S1 = a1
S2 = a1 + a2
S3 = a1 + a2 + a3
S4 = a1 + a2 + a3 + a4
Another common notation for the nth partial sum uses the capital Greek letter sigma,
“.” This notation also makes use of an or a formula for an. “(5

“add the ans beginning with a1 and ending with a5.

Arithmetic Sequences
A term in an arithmetic sequence is computed by adding a ﬁxed number to the
previous term. For example, 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, . . . is an arithmetic sequence because
we can add 4 to any term to ﬁnd the following term. We can deﬁne the nth term
recursively as an = an−1 + d or, in more general terms, an = a1 + (n −1)d. In
the sequence above, a1 = 3 and d = 4.
EXAMPLES
Find the ﬁrst four terms and the 100th term.
•
an = 28 + (n −1)1.5
a1 = 28
a2 = 28 + (2 −1)1.5 = 29.5
a3 = 28 + (3 −1)1.5 = 31
a4 = 28 + (4 −1)1.5 = 32.5

•
an = −2 + (n −1)(−6)
a1 = −2
a2 = −2 + (2 −1)(−6) = −8
a3 = −2 + (3 −1)(−6) = −14
a4 = −2 + (4 −1)(−6) = −20
a100 = −2 + (100 −1)(−6) = −596
When asked whether or not a sequence is arithmetic, we will ﬁnd the difference
between consecutive terms. If the difference is the same, the sequence is arithmetic.

Because the differences are not the same, the sequence is not arithmetic.
We can ﬁnd any term in an arithmetic sequence if we know either one term and
the common difference or two terms. We need to use the formula an = a1+(n−1)d
and, if necessary, a little algebra. For example, if we are told the common difference
is 6 and the tenth term is 141, then we can put an = 141, n = 10, and d = 6 in the
formula to ﬁnd a1.
141 = a1 + (10 −1)6
87 = a1
The nth term is an = 87 + (n −1)6.

too. The equations are 8 = a1 + (12 −1)d and 32 = a1 + (20 −1)d.

•
The eighth term is 4, and the twentieth term is −38.
The information in these two terms gives us the system of equations 4 =

Geometric Sequences
In an arithmetic sequence, the difference of any two consecutive terms is the
same, and in a geometric sequence, the quotient of any two consecutive terms
is the same. A term in a geometric sequence can be found by multiplying the
previous term by a ﬁxed number. For example, the next term in the sequence
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . . is 2(16)=32, and the term after that is 2(32)=64. This ﬁxed number

CHAPTER 14
Sequences and Series
427
is called the common ratio. We can deﬁne the nth term of a geometric sequence
recursively by an = ran−1. The general formula is an = a1rn−1.
EXAMPLES
•

We can ﬁnd the nth term of a geometric sequence by either knowing one term
and the common ratio or by knowing two terms. This is similar to what we did to
ﬁnd the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.
EXAMPLES
Find the nth term of the geometric sequence.
•
The common ratio is 3 and the fourth term is 54.
a4 = 54 and r = 3, so an = a1rn−1 becomes 54 = a134−1. This gives us
a1 = 2. The nth term is an = 2(3)n−1.

The third term is 320, and the ﬁfth term is 204.8.
a3 = 320 and a5 = 204.8 give us the system of equations 320 = a1r3−1 and
204.8 = a1r5−1. Elimination by addition will not work for the systems in
this section, so we will use substitution. Solving for a1 in a1r2 = 320 gives
us a1 = 320/r2. Substituting this in a1r4 = 204.8 gives us the following.
a1r4 = 204.8
320
r2 · r4 = 204.8
320r2 = 204.8
r2 = 0.64
r = ±0.8
There are two geometric sequences whose third term is 320 and whose ﬁfth
term is 204.8, one has a common ratio of 0.8 and the other, −0.8. a1 for both
the sequences is the same.
a1 = 320
0.82 = 500
and
a1 =
320
(−0.8)2 = 500
The nth term for one sequence is an = 500(0.8)n−1, and the other is an =
500(−0.8)n−1.

The third term is 20, and the sixth term is 81.92.
From a3

81.92 we have the system of equations
20 = a1r3−1 and 81.92 = a1r6−1. We will solve for a1 in 20 = a1r2.
Now we will substitute a1 = 20/r2 for a1 in 81.92 = a1r5.
81.92 = a1r5
81.92 = 20

81.92 = 20r3

When the common ratio is small enough (−1 < r < 1 and r ̸= 0), the sum of
all terms in a geometric sequence is a number. In the ﬁnite sum Sn = a1 1−rn
1−r , rn
is very small when the ratio is a fraction, so 1 −rn is very close to 1. Using this
fact and calculus techniques (usually learned in a later calculus course), it can be
shown that the sum of all terms of this kind of geometric sequence is
S = a1
1
1 −r .
The only difference between the inﬁnite sum formula and the partial sum formula
is that 1 −rn is replaced by 1. If n is large enough, there is very little difference
between the partial sum and the entire sum. We will compare the sum of the ﬁrst
20 terms of the sequence whose nth term is an = (1

When regular payments are made to a savings account or to a lottery winner,
the monthly balances act like terms in a geometric sequence. The common ratio is
either 1 + i (for savings payments) or (1 + i)−1 (for lottery payments), where i is
the interest rate per payment period. We learned in Chapter 9 that if we leave P
dollars in an account, earning annual interest r, compounded n times per year, for
t years, then this will grow to A dollars where A = P(1 + r/n)nt. (This is why
i replaces r/n.)
We will see what happens to the balance of an account if $2000 is deposited
on January 1 every year for 5 years, earning 10% per year, compounded annually.
The ﬁrst $2000 will earn interest for the entire 5 years, so it will grow to 2000
(1 + 0.10/1)5 = 2000(1.10)5. The second $2000 will earn interest for 4 years,
so it will grow to 2000(1.10)4. The third $2000 will earn interest for 3 years,
so it will grow to 2000(1.10)3. The fourth $2000 will earn interest for 2 years, so
it will grow to 2000(1.10)2. And the ﬁfth $2000 will earn interest for 1 year, so it
will grow to 2000(1.10)1. The balance after ﬁve years is
2000(1.10)5 + 2000(1.10)4 + 2000(1.10)3 + 2000(1.10)2 + 2000(1.10)1.
This is the sum of the ﬁrst ﬁve terms of the geometric sequence whose nth term is
an = 2000(1.10)n. If we want to use the partial sum formula, we need to rewrite
the nth term in the form an = a1rn−1. We will use exponent properties to change
2000(1.10)n to a1(1.10)n−1. We will also use the fact that n = 1 + n −1.
2000(1.10)n = 2000(1.10)1+n−1 = 2000(1.10)1(1.10)n−1
= [2000(1.10)](1.10)n−1 = 2200(1.10)n−1
Now we can use the partial sum formula.
S5 = 2200 · 1 −1.105
1 −1.10 = 13, 431.22
The balance in the account will be $13,431.22.

When a lottery winner wins a $1,000,000 jackpot, the money is likely to be paid
out in $50,000 annual payments for 20 years. Some states allow the winner to take
the cash value as a lump sum payment instead. The cash value is the present value
of $1,000,000 to be paid in annual payments over 20 years. The formula for the
present value of A dollars, due in t years, earning annual interest r, compounded
n times per year is A(1 + r/n)−nt. Assume that the money is expected to earn
5% per year. Then the cash value of the jackpot will need to be enough money so
that at the beginning of the year (for a payment at the end of the year), they have
50,000(1.05)−1. For a payment at the end of two years, they need 50,000(1.05)−2;
at the end of three years, they need 50,000(1.05)−3, and so on until they reach the
last payment after 20 years, 50,000(1.05)−20. In other words, the cash value of a
$1,000,000 jackpot with a 20-year payout (assuming 5% interest) is
50,000(1.05)−1 + 50,000(1.05)−2 + 50,000(1.05)−3 + · · · + 50,000(1.05)−20.
This is the sum of the ﬁrst 20 terms of the geometric sequence whose nth term is
an = 50,000(1.05)−n. We need to use exponent properties to rewrite the nth term
in the form an = a1rn−1. We will use the fact that −n = −n −1 + 1 and the
exponent facts that xm+n = xmxn and xmn = (xm)n.
1.05−n = 1.05−n+1−1 = 1.05−1 · 1.05−n+1 = 1.05−1 · 1.05−1(n−1)
= 1.05−1 · (1.05−1)n−1
Now the nth term can be written as an = [50,000(1.05)−1](1.05−1)n−1, where
a1 = 50,000(1.05−1). Now we can use the partial sum formula.
S20 = [50,000(1.05−1)] · 1 −(1.05−1)20
1 −1.05−1
≈623,110.51
The cash value is $623,110.51.

Solving Equations and Inequalities
Using algebra to solve equations and inequalities is important in precalculus and
calculus. Usually the solution to an equation is a number or numbers. Sometimes,
the solution to an equation is simply the equation written another way. To solve for
x means to have x, and x only, on one side of the equation. The equation x = y−5
y2+1
is solved for x but x =
y−5
x2+1 is not solved for x because x is on both sides of
the equation. Solving for x when the equation contains more than one variable is
very much like solving for x when the equation has only one variable. We move
quantities from one side of the equation by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and
dividing.
•
Solve for x in the equation a(x + 4) −2a(x −1) = 5(a + x).
a(x + 4) −2a(x −1) = 5(a + x)
Simplify both sides of the equation.
ax + 4a −2ax + 2a = 5a + 5x
ax −2ax + 6a = 5a + 5x Move x terms to one side of the equation.

Quadratic Equations
Equations of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 (where a ̸= 0) are quadratic equations.
There are several techniques we can use to solve them, factoring, completing the
square, and the quadratic formula. The simplest quadratic equations are in the form
x2 = number. This equation has solutions x =
√
number and x = −
√
number, or
simply, x = ±
√
number. For example, the solutions for x2 = 36 are x = 6 and
x = −6, or x = ±6.
Many quadratic equations can be solved by factoring. When there is a zero on
one side of the equation, we factor the other side, set each factor equal to zero and
solve both equations. This method comes from the fact that ab = 0 implies a = 0
or b = 0.
•
x2 + x −6 = 0
x2 + x −6 factors as (x + 3)(x −2). Set each of x + 3 and x −2 equal to 0
and solve for x.
x + 3 = 0
x −2 = 0
x = −3
x = 2
•
3x2 + 24 = −18x
We need a zero on one side of the equation, so we will move 18x to the
other side.
3x2 + 18x + 24 = 0
3(x2 + 6x + 8) = 0
3(x + 2)(x + 4) = 0
x + 2 = 0
x + 4 = 0
x = −2
x = −4

A quadratic equation can have square roots of numbers as solutions that need to
be simpliﬁed. The square root of a number is simpliﬁed when it does not have any
perfect squares as factors. For example,
√
24 is not simpliﬁed because 24 = 22 ×6.
We can use the exponent properties

ab = √a·
√
b and n√
an = a to simplify

24.

simpliﬁed. These numbers often come up in trigonometry. Sometimes we can
multiply the fraction by the denominator over itself.

This trick will not work for expressions such as

3+1. To simplify these
fractions, we will use the fact that (a −b)(a + b) = a2 −b2. This allows us
to square each term in the denominator individually. The denominator is in
the form a + b (where a =
√
3 and b = 1). We will multiply the fraction by
a −b over itself.

Factoring by Grouping
Some expressions of the form ax3+bx2+cx +d can be factored using a technique
called factoring by grouping. This technique takes two steps. The ﬁrst step is to
factor the ﬁrst two terms and the second two terms so that each pair of terms has
a common factor. The second step is to factor this common factor. For example,
if we factor x2 from the ﬁrst two terms of x3 + 2x2 + 3x + 6, we are left with
x2(x + 2) + 3x + 6. Now we look at the second two terms, 3x + 6, and factor
it so that x + 2 is a factor. If we factor 3 from 3x + 6, we are left with x + 2 as

Appendix
443
a factor: 3x + 6 = 3(x + 2). This leaves us with x2(x + 2) + 3(x + 2). In the last
step, we factor x + 2 from each term, leaving x2 and 3.
x3 + 2x2 + 3x + 6 = x2(x + 2) + 3(x + 2)
= (x + 2)(x2 + 3)
We can use this technique to solve equations.
•
4x3 −5x2 −36x + 45 = 0
Once we have factored 4x3 −5x2 −36x + 45, we will set each factor equal
to 0 and solve for x. If we factor x2 from the ﬁrst two terms, we have
4x3 −5x2 = x2(4x −5). If we factor −9 from the second two terms, we
have −36x + 45 = −9(4x −5).
4x3 −5x2 −36x + 45 = 0
x2(4x −5) −9(4x −5) = 0
(4x −5)(x2 −9) = 0

Solving axn = b and a n√x = b
Solve equations of the form axn = b by ﬁrst dividing both sides of the equation
by a, then by taking the nth root of both sides. If n is even, use a ± symbol on one
side of the equation to get both solutions.
