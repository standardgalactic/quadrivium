• Video exercises – engaging videos that bring business concepts to life and explore business topics 
related to the theory students are learning in class. Quizzes then assess students’ comprehension of  
the concepts covered in each video.
• Learning Catalytics – a “bring your own device” student engagement, assessment, and classroom 
intelligence system helps instructors analyze students’ critical-thinking skills during lecture.
• Dynamic Study Modules (DSMs) – through adaptive learning, students get personalized guidance 
where and when they need it most, creating greater engagement, improving knowledge retention,  
and supporting subject-matter mastery.  Also available on mobile devices.
• Business Today – bring current events alive in your classroom with videos, discussion  
questions, and author blogs. Be sure to check back often, this section changes daily.
• Decision-making simulations – place your 
students in the role of a key decision-maker. The 
simulation will change and branch based on the 
decisions students make, providing a variation of 
scenario paths. Upon completion of each simulation, 
students receive a grade, as well as a detailed report 
of the choices they made during the simulation and 
the associated consequences of those decisions.
• Writing Space – better writers make great learners—who perform better in their courses. Providing 
a single location to develop and assess concept mastery and critical thinking, the Writing Space offers 
automatic graded, assisted graded, and create your own writing assignments, allowing you to exchange 
personalized feedback with students quickly and easily.
Writing Space can also check students’ work for improper citation or plagiarism by comparing it 
against the world’s most accurate text comparison database available from Turnitin.
• Additional Features – included with the MyLab are a powerful homework and test manager, robust 
gradebook tracking, comprehensive online course content, and easily scalable and shareable content.

P re f ac e
We wrote this book for business school students who wanted an in-depth look at 
how today's business firms use information technologies and systems to achieve 
corporate objectives. Information systems are one of the major tools available 
to business managers for achieving operational excellence,  developing new 
products and services, improving decision making, and achieving  competitive 
advantage. Students will find here the most up-to-date and comprehensive 
overview of information systems used by business firms today. After  reading 
this book, we expect students will be able to participate in, and even lead, 
 management discussions of information systems for their firms.
When interviewing potential employees, business firms often look for new 
hires who know how to use information systems and technologies for  achieving 
bottom-line business results. Regardless of whether you are an accounting, 
finance, management, operations management, marketing, or information 
 systems major, the knowledge and information you find in this book will be 
valuable throughout your business career.

WHAT’S NEW IN MIS?
Plenty. In fact, there’s a whole new world of doing business using new 
 technologies for managing and organizing. What makes the MIS field the most 
exciting area of study in schools of business is the continuous change in technol-
ogy, management, and business processes. (Chapter 1 describes these changes 
in more detail.)
IT Innovations. A continuing stream of information technology innovations 
is transforming the traditional business world. Examples include the emergence 
of cloud  computing, the growth of a mobile digital business platform based on 
 smartphones and tablet computers, and not least, the use of social networks by 
managers to achieve business objectives. Most of these changes have occurred 
in the last few years. These innovations enabling entrepreneurs and innovative

traditional firms to create new products and services, develop new business 
models, and transform the day-to-day conduct of business. In the process, some 
old businesses, even industries, are being destroyed while new businesses are 
springing up.
New Business Models. For instance, the emergence of online video stores like 
Netflix for streaming, and Apple iTunes for downloading, has forever changed 
how premium video is distributed, and even created. Netflix in 2013 attracted 
30 million subscribers to its DVD rental and streaming movie  business. Netflix 
now accounts for 90  percent of streaming premium movies and TV shows, 
and consumes an estimated 33 percent of Internet bandwidth in the United 
States. Netflix has moved into premium TV show production with House of 
Cards, and Arrested Development, challenging cable networks like HBO, and 
potentially disrupting the cable channels dominance of TV show production. 
Apple’s iTunes now accounts for 67 percent of movie and TV show downloads 
and has struck deals with major Hollywood studios for recent movies and TV 
shows. A growing trickle of viewers are unplugging from cable and using only 
the Internet for entertainment.
E-commerce Expanding. E-commerce will generate an estimated $470 
 billion in revenues in 2014, and is estimated to grow to nearly $700 billion in 
2018. Amazon's revenues grew 21 percent to $74 billion in 2013, despite a slowly 
expanding economy growing at 2 percent annually, while offline retail grew by 
only 5 percent. E-commerce is changing how firms design, produce and deliver 
their products and services. E-commerce has reinvented itself again, disrupting 
the traditional marketing and advertising industry and putting major media 
and content firms in jeopardy. Facebook and other social networking sites such 
as YouTube, Twitter, and Tumblr, exemplify the new face of e-commerce in the 
21st Century. They sell services. When we think of e-commerce we tend to 
think of a selling physical products. While this iconic vision of e-commerce is 
still very powerful and the fastest growing form of retail in the U.S., growing 
up alongside is a whole new value stream based on selling services, not goods. 
It’s a services model of e-commerce. Growth in social commerce is spurred by 
 powerful growth of the mobile platform: 60  percent of Facebook’s users access 
the service from mobile phones and tablets. Information systems and technolo-
gies are the foundation of this new services-based e-commerce. 
Management Changes. Likewise, the management of business firms has 
changed: With new mobile smartphones, high-speed wireless Wi-Fi networks, 
and wireless laptop  computers, remote salespeople on the road are only seconds 
away from their  managers’ questions and oversight. Managers on the move are 
in direct, continuous  contact with their employees. The growth of enterprise-
wide information  systems with extraordinarily rich data means that manag-
ers no longer operate in a fog of  confusion, but instead have online, nearly 
instant, access to the really important information they need for accurate and 
timely decisions. In addition to their public uses on the Web, wikis and blogs 
are becoming important corporate tools for communication, collaboration, and 
information sharing.
Changes in Firms and Organizations: Compared to industrial organizations 
of the previous century, new fast-growing 21st Century business firms put less 
emphasis on  hierarchy and structure, and more emphasis on employees taking 
on multiple roles and tasks.  They put greater emphasis on competency and skills 
rather than  position in the hierarchy. They emphasize higher speed and more 
accurate decision making based on data and analysis. They are more aware of

Preface
changes in technology, consumer attitudes, and culture. They use social media to 
enter into conversations with consumers, and demonstrate a greater  willingness 
to listen to consumers, in part because they have no choice. They show better 
understanding of the importance of  information technology in  creating and 
 managing business firms and other  organizations. To the extent organizations 
and business firms  demonstrate these characteristics, they are 21st Century 
 digital firms. 
THE 14TH EDITION: THE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION 
FOR THE MIS CURRICULUM
Since its inception, this text has helped to define the MIS course around the 
globe. This edition continues to be authoritative, but is also more customizable, 
flexible, and geared to meeting the needs of different colleges, universities, and 
individual instructors. Many of its learning tools are now available in digital 
form. This book is now part of a complete learning package that includes the 
core text, Video Case Package, and Learning Tracks.
The core text consists of 15 chapters with hands-on projects covering the 
most essential topics in MIS. An important part of the core text is the Video 
Case Study and Instructional Video Package: 39 video case studies (2-3 per 
chapter) plus 18 instructional videos that illustrate business uses of information 
systems, explain new technologies, and explore concepts. Videos are keyed to 
the topics of each chapter.
In addition, for students and instructors who want to go deeper into selected 
topics, there are 47 online Learning Tracks that cover a variety of MIS topics in 
greater depth. 
THE CORE TEXT
The core text provides an overview of fundamental MIS concepts using an 
integrated framework for describing and analyzing information systems. 
This framework shows information systems composed of people, organiza-
tion, and technology elements and is reinforced in student projects and case 
studies.
Chapter Organization
Each chapter contains the following elements:
• A Chapter Outline based on Learning Objectives
• Lists of all the Case Studies and Video Cases for each chapter
• A chapter-opening case describing a real-world organization to establish 
the theme and importance of the chapter
• A diagram analyzing the opening case in terms of the management, 
 organization, and technology model used throughout the text
• Two Interactive Sessions with Case Study Questions 
• A Review Summary keyed to the Student Learning Objectives
• A list of Key Terms that students can use to review concepts

KEY FEATURES
We have enhanced the text to make it more interactive, leading-edge, and 
appealing to both students and instructors. The features and learning tools are 
described in the following sections:
Business-Driven with Real-World Business Cases and 
Examples
The text helps students see the direct connection between information  systems 
and business performance. It describes the main business objectives  driving the 
use of information systems and technologies in corporations all over the world: 
operational excellence; new products and services; customer and  supplier 
 intimacy; improved decision making; competitive advantage; and  survival. 
In-text examples and case studies show students how specific companies use 
information systems to achieve these objectives.
We use only current (2014) examples from business and public organizations 
throughout the text to illustrate the important concepts in each chapter. All the 
case studies describe companies or organizations that are familiar to  students, 
such as Facebook, Walmart, Google, Target, Home Depot, Toyota, and Lego.
A diagram accompanying 
each chapter-opening case 
graphically illustrates how 
management, organization, 
and technology elements work 
together to create an informa-
tion system solution to the 
business challenges discussed 
in the case. 

26 
Preface
Interactivity
There’s no better way to learn about MIS than by doing MIS! We provide 
 different kinds of hands-on projects where students can work with real-world 
business scenarios and data, and learn firsthand what MIS is all about. These 
projects heighten student involvement in this exciting subject. 
• Online Video Case Package. Students can watch short videos online, 
either in-class or at home or work, and then apply the concepts of the 
book to the analysis of the video. Every chapter contains at least two 
business video cases that explain how business firms and managers are 
using information systems, describe new management practices, and 
explore concepts discussed in the chapter. Each video case consists of a 
video about a real-world company, a background text case, and case study 
questions. These video cases enhance students’ understanding of MIS 
topics and the relevance of MIS to the business world. In addition, there 
are 18 Instructional Videos that describe developments and concepts in 
MIS keyed to respective chapters. 
• Interactive Sessions. Two short cases in each chapter have been 
 redesigned as Interactive Sessions to be used in the classroom (or on 
Internet discussion boards) to stimulate student interest and active 
 learning. Each case concludes with case study questions. The case study 
questions provide topics for class discussion, Internet discussion, or 
 written assignments. 
Case Study Questions 
encourage students to apply 
chapter concepts to real-world 
companies in class discussions, 
student presentations, or 
writing assignments.
Each chapter contains two 
Interactive Sessions on 
Management, Organizations, 
or Technology using real-world 
companies to illustrate chapter 
concepts and issues.

 
Preface 
27
Each chapter features a 
project to develop Internet 
skills for accessing informa-
tion, conducting research, and 
performing online calculations 
and analysis.
Two real-world business 
scenarios per chapter provide 
opportunities for 
students to apply chapter 
concepts and practice man-
agement decision making.
• Hands-on MIS Projects. Every chapter concludes with a Hands-on 
MIS Projects section containing three types of projects: two 
Management Decision Problems, a hands-on application software 
 exercise using Microsoft Excel, Access, or Web page and blog creation 
tools, and a  project that develops Internet business skills. A Dirt Bikes 
USA running case provides additional hands-on projects for each 
chapter. 
• Collaboration and Teamwork Projects. Each chapter features a 
collaborative project that encourages students working in teams to use 
Google Drive, Google Docs, or other open-source collaboration tools. 
The first team project in Chapter 1 asks students to build a collaborative 
Google site.
Students practice using 
software in real-world settings 
for achieving operational 
excellence and enhancing 
decision making.

Preface
Assessment and AACSB Assessment Guidelines
The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) is a not-for-
profit corporation of educational institutions, corporations and other organiza-
tions that seeks to improve business education primarily by accrediting univer-
sity business programs. As a part of its accreditation activities, the AACSB has 
developed an Assurance of Learning Program designed to ensure that schools 
do in fact teach students what they promise. Schools are required to state a 
clear mission, develop a coherent business program, identify student learning 
objectives, and then prove that students do in fact achieve the objectives. 
We have attempted in this book to support AACSB efforts to encourage 
assessment-based education. The authors will provide custom advice on how 
to use this text in their  colleges with different missions and assessment needs. 
Please e-mail the authors or  contact your local Pearson representative for con-
tact information. 
For more information on the AACSB Assurance of Learning Program, and 
how this text supports assessment-based learning, please visit the Web site for 
this book. 
Customization and Flexibility: New Learning Track

I
n 1871, twenty-one English clubs decided that their sport, officially called 
rugby union but commonly referred to simply as rugby, needed an 
administrative body. The clubs formed The Rugby Football Union (RFU), 
which today manages the English national team (England Rugby) in part-
nership with Premier Rugby Limited. Responsible for the promotion of rugby 
at all levels, the RFU organizes the Six Nations Championship, the unofficial 
northern hemisphere championship featuring teams from England, Scotland, 
Wales, Italy, Ireland, and France, and the Heineken Cup, its club-level coun-
terpart. Owned by its member clubs, the RFU’s mission is to maximize profits 
from international ticket sales and vending so that it can support the more 
than 60,000 volunteers who organize matches and seminars, help secure loans 
and insurance policies, fundraise, write grant proposals, provide medical 
advice and support, and perform the clerical duties that keep the lower-level 
clubs operating.
To succeed in this complicated mission, the RFU entered into a five-year 
deal with IBM to capture and analyze Big Data that will be useful to both 
fans, and later—it is hoped—the players themselves. The system is called 
TryTracker.  In rugby, a try, worth five points, is the highest scoring oppor-
tunity.  Teams get possession of the ball through a scrum, a contest for the 
ball where eight players bind together and push against eight players from 
the other team.  The outcome determines who can control the ball.  To score 
a try, a team must break through the opposition’s defenses, move into their 
in-goal area, and “ground” the ball. This is done in one of two ways. A player 
can either hold the ball in one or both hands or arms and then touch it to 
the ground in the in-goal area, or exert downward pressure on a ball already 
RUGBY FOOTBALL UNION TRIES BIG DATA

on the ground using one or both hands or arms or the upper front of the body 
(from the neck to the waistline).
The IBM TryTracker does not just track tries, however. It uses predictive ana-
lytics to track three categories of data: keys to the game, momentum, and key 
players.  Traditional rugby statistics on team and individual performance as 
well as live text commentary complement the TryTracker data. The keys to the 
game are determined ahead of a specific contest by analyzing a historical data-
base of past matchups between a pair. For example, factors that contributed to 
victory may have included achieving a certain percentage of successful kicks 
on goal or scrums won, a specific number of lineouts, or a particular conver-
sion rate. Fans can use their mobile devices to keep track of how their favorite 
team is faring, concentrating on game elements that will increase its winning 
chances. Key players for each team are selected after the game by comparing a 
single score compiled using different criteria for each position. Goal scoring is 
currently excluded so as not to overvalue kickers and undervalue players who 
contribute to creating scoring opportunities. 
Like the IBM SlamTracker used at the Grand Slam tennis tournaments, the 
goal of TryTracker is to provide data visualization and real-time statistics to draw 
in fans. To compete with more popular sports such as Premier League football 
and expand rugby’s fan base before England hosts the 2015 Rugby World Cup, 
the RFU hopes that enhanced communication will increase fan engagement. 
As their understanding of game mechanics and emotional investment in what 
their team needs to do in order to prevail grows, casual fans will become dedi-
cated fans who return again and again. Beyond marketing strategy, the long-
term potential of predictive analysis is that it may provide tactical insights to 
players and coaches that will improve match play and thus the overall product 
offered to fans.

The challenges facing the RFU demonstrate why information systems are 
so essential today. The RFU is classified as a “Friendly Society,” somewhere 
between a true company and a charity. It receives both government support 
and corporate sponsorship money. But it must maximize revenues from ticket 
sales, hospitality and catering, television rights, and its travel company in order 
to support both grassroots and elite rugby in England.
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter. The RFU entered into a strategic partnership with 
IBM to educate and engage fans. Using the data collected by sports data com-
pany Opta and the analytics developed by IBM, it may also be able to improve 
coaching and game performance as an additional way of cultivating customers. 
IBM is also helping the RFU to develop a customer relationship management 
(CRM) system integrated with its Web site.
Here are some questions to think about: What role does technology play in 
the RFU’s success as the administrative head of rugby union in England? Assess 
the contributions which these systems make to the future of RFU.

1.1 
HOW ARE INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
TRANSFORMING BUSINESS, AND WHY ARE THEY 
SO ESSENTIAL FOR RUNNING AND MANAGING A 
BUSINESS TODAY?
I
t’s not business as usual in America anymore, or the rest of the global econ-
omy. In 2014, American businesses will spend an estimated $817  billion 
on information systems hardware, software, and telecommunications 
equipment. In addition, they will spend another $230  billion on  business 
and management consulting and services—much of which involves redesign-
ing firms’ business operations to take advantage of these new  technologies. 
Figure 1.1 shows that between 1999 and 2013, private  business  investment in 
 information technology consisting of hardware, software, and communications 
 equipment grew from 14 percent to 33 percent of all invested capital.
As managers, most of you will work for firms that are intensively using 
information systems and making large investments in information technol-
ogy. You will certainly want to know how to invest this money wisely. If 
you make wise choices, your firm can outperform competitors. If you make 
poor choices, you will be wasting valuable capital. This book is dedicated to 
 helping you make wise decisions about information technology and informa-
tion systems.
HOW INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE TRANSFORMING 
BUSINESS
You can see the results of this massive spending around you every day by 
 observing how people conduct business. Changes in technology, and new 
 innovative business models, have transformed social life and business  practices. 
Over 247 million Americans have mobile phones (67% of the  population), 
and 167 million of these people access the Internet using  smartphones and 
tablets. 46% of the entire population now use tablet computers whose sales 
have soared. 172 million Americans use online social networks, 150 million

use Facebook, while 48 million use Twitter. Smartphones, social networking, 
texting, emailing, and Webinars have all become essential tools of business 
because that’s where your customers, suppliers, and colleagues can be found. 
(eMarketer, 2014).
By June 2014, more than 114 million businesses worldwide had dot-com 
Internet sites registered (Domain Tools, 2014). Today, 196 million Americans 
shop online, and 163 million will purchase online. Every day about 90 million 
Americans go online to research a product or service. (eMarketer, 2014).
In 2013, FedEx moved about 3.5 million packages daily to 220 countries and 
territories around the world, mostly overnight, and the United Parcel Service 
(UPS) moved over 16 million packages daily worldwide. Businesses are using 
information technology to sense and respond to rapidly changing customer 
demand, reduce inventories to the lowest possible levels, and achieve higher 
levels of operational efficiency. Supply chains have become more fast-paced, 
with companies of all sizes depending on just-in-time  inventory to reduce their 
overhead costs and get to market faster.
As newspaper print readership continues to decline, more than 168  million 
people read a newspaper online, and millions more read other news sites. 
About 83 million people watch a video online every day, 66 million read a 
blog, and 25 million post to blogs, creating an explosion of new writers and 
new forms of customer feedback that did not exist five years ago (eMarketer, 
2014). Social networking site Facebook attracted 152 million monthly  visitors in 
2014 in the United States, and over 1 billion worldwide. Google+ has attracted 
over 130  million users in the United States. Businesses are starting to use 
social  networking tools to connect their employees, customers, and managers 
worldwide. Many Fortune 500 companies now have Facebook pages, Twitter 
accounts, and Tumblr sites. 
E-commerce and Internet advertising continue to expand. Google’s online ad 
revenues surpassed $17 billion in 2013, and Internet advertising continues to

grow at more than 15 percent a year, reaching more than $43 billion in  revenues 
in 2013 (eMarketer, 2014).
New federal security and accounting laws, requiring many businesses to 
keep e-mail messages for five years, coupled with existing occupational and 
health laws requiring firms to store employee chemical exposure data for 
up to 60 years, are spurring the annual growth of digital information at the 
estimated rate of 5 exabytes annually, equivalent to 37,000 new Libraries of 
Congress.
WHAT’S NEW IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS?
Lots! What makes management information systems the most exciting topic 
in business is the continual change in technology, management use of the 
 technology, business models and the impact on business success. New 
 businesses and industries appear, old ones decline, and successful firms are 
those that learn how to use the new technologies. Table 1.1 summarizes the 
major new themes in business uses of information systems. These themes will 
appear throughout the book in all the chapters, so it might be a good idea to 
take some time now and discuss these with your professor and other students.
There are three interrelated changes in the technology area: (1) the 
 widespread adoption of the mobile computing  platform, (2) the growing 
 business use of “big data,” and (3) the growth in “cloud computing,” where more 
and more business  software runs over the Internet.
IPhones, iPads, Android tablets, and smartphones are not just gadgets or 
entertainment outlets. They represent new emerging computing platforms 
based on an array of new hardware and software technologies. More and more 
business computing is moving from PCs and desktop machines to these mobile 
devices. Managers are increasingly using these devices to coordinate work, 
communicate with employees, and provide information for decision making. 
We call these developments the “mobile digital platform.”
Managers routinely use online collaboration and social technologies in order 
to make better, faster decisions. As management behavior changes, how work 
gets organized, coordinated, and measured also changes. By connecting employ-
ees working on teams and projects, the social network is where works gets 
done, where plans are executed, and where managers manage. Collaboration 
spaces are where employees meet one another—even when they are separated 
by continents and time zones.
The strength of cloud computing and the growth of the mobile digital  platform 
allow organizations to rely more on telework, remote work, and  distributed 
decision making. This same platform means firms can outsource more work, 
and rely on markets (rather than employees) to build value. It also means that 
firms can collaborate with suppliers and customers to create new products, or 
make existing products more efficiently.
You can see some of these trends at work in the Interactive Session on 
Management. Millions of managers rely heavily on the mobile digital 
 platform to coordinate suppliers and shipments, satisfy customers, and man-
age their employees. A business day without these mobile devices or Internet 
access would be unthinkable. As you read this case, note how the mobile 
platform greatly enhances the accuracy, speed, and richness of decision 
 making.

GLOBALIZATION CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES: 
A FLATTENED WORLD
In 1492, Columbus reaffirmed what astronomers were long saying: the world 
was round and the seas could be safely sailed. As it turned out, the world was 
populated by peoples and languages living in isolation from one another, with

CHANGE
BUSINESS IMPACT 
TECHNOLOGY
Cloud computing platform emerges as a major business area of 
innovation 
A flexible collection of computers on the Internet begins to perform 
tasks traditionally performed on corporate computers. Major business 
applications are delivered online as an Internet service (Software as a 
Service, or SaaS).
Big data
Businesses look for insights from huge volumes of data from Web traffic, 
e-mail messages, social media content, and machines (sensors) that 
require new data management tools to capture, store, and analyze.
A mobile digital platform emerges to compete with the PC as a 
business system
The Apple iPhone and tablet computers and Android mobile devices are 
able to download hundreds of thousands of applications to support 
collaboration, location-based services, and communication with 
colleagues. Small tablet computers, including the iPad and Kindle Fire, 
challenge conventional laptops as platforms for consumer and 
corporate computing.
MANAGEMENT
Managers adopt online collaboration and social networking software 
to improve coordination, collaboration, and knowledge sharing
Google Apps, Google Sites, Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services, 
and IBM Lotus Connections are used by over 100 million business 
professionals worldwide to support blogs, project management, online 
meetings, personal profiles, social bookmarks, and online communities.
Business intelligence applications accelerate
More powerful data analytics and interactive dashboards provide   
real-time performance information to managers to enhance decision 
making.
Virtual meetings proliferate
Managers adopt telepresence videoconferencing and Web conferencing 
technologies to reduce travel time, and cost, while improving 
collaboration and decision making. 
ORGANIZATIONS
Social business
Businesses use social networking platforms, including Facebook, 
Twitter, and internal corporate social tools, to deepen interactions with 
employees, customers, and suppliers. Employees use blogs, wikis, 
e-mail texting, and SMS messaging to interact in online communities. 
Telework gains momentum in the workplace
The Internet, wireless laptops, smartphones, and tablet computers 
make it possible for growing numbers of people to work away from the 
traditional office. Fifty-five percent of U.S. businesses have some form 
of remote work program.
Co-creation of business value
Sources of business value shift from products to solutions and 
experiences, and from internal sources to networks of suppliers and 
collaboration with customers. Supply chains and product development 
become more global and collaborative; customer interactions help 
firms define new products and services.

How much of your job can you do from the palm of 
your hand? Probably more than you think. Today 
there are many job functions for both rank-and-
file employees and their managers that can be 
 performed using mobile phones and tablets, includ-
ing the iPad, iPhone, and Android mobile devices. 
Companies are enhancing their security systems 
so that mobile users can remotely access corporate 
 systems with confidence. And they are developing 
more far-reaching applications to take advantage of 
the stunning mobile and graphic capabilities. Mobile 
technology is spreading to core work functions, such 
as marketing materials for pharmaceutical reps, 
 customer account software for service technicians, 
and apps for farmers to test the quality of cow’s milk.
McClendon’s Select, a Peoria-based organic family-
run farm, relies on iPad for each stage of its operation: 
planting fields, picking crops, filling orders, loading 
trucks, delivering to restaurants, and selling products 
at farmers’ markets. Co-owner Sean McClendon uses 
a wireless camera on his tractor to ensure crop rows 
are as straight as possible. The mydlinkLite app on 
his iPad lets him watch the footage as he plows. The 
farm’s planting manager no longer needs to leave the 
field to handle the careful record-keeping required 
to maintain an organic certification. Using her iPad 
connection to the 3G cellular network, she is able to 
access the Web-based COG Pro management system 
to update her records of seed types and where and 
when they’re planted. 
Before McClendon’s went digital, orders were 
handwritten on a white board, a process that was too 
time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. Now each 
employee grabs an iPad when arriving for work in 
the morning and uses a proprietary app called Picker 
Entry to generate a list of products to collect in the 
field based on online orders placed by restaurants and 
consumers. Using AirPrint technology in the iPad, 
employees then wirelessly print their orders and head 
out to the field to pick product. After the employees 
return from the field, they add inventory that they 
picked using an iPad. They are able to see all of the 
 restaurants on the screen, tap the restaurant name, 
and fill the orders right from the iPad.
When employees load those orders on trucks for 
deliveries, Picker Entry on the iPad replaces a manual 
process that used to take 30 to 45 minutes. A single 
tap to the iPad generates a report telling where each 
box goes on the truck for restaurant deliveries. One 
of the main reasons restaurants use McClendon’s is 
because of its order accuracy. 
Using handhelds to run the business is not limited 
to small companies. PepsiCo manufactures and sells 
brands including Pepsi, Gatorade, Mountain Dew, 
Tropicana, Quaker, and Frito-Lay worldwide and has 
nearly 280,000 employees. The company uses a com-
plex web of interlocking distribution systems to move 
its products from its manufacturing and warehouse 
facilities onto trucks and then into stores in time to 
meet customer demand. PepsiCo runs about 17,000 
distribution routes each day. The iPhone and iPad 
help employees of PepsiCo’s North America Beverages 
 division ensure that the right products arrive in the 
right locations as quickly and efficiently as possible.
In the past, PepsiCo drivers and merchandisers 
began each day by picking up printed schedules with 
order quantities and tasks to be performed at each 
outlet, from unloading cases of soda to setting up 
new product displays. It was difficult to accommodate 
 last-minute changes in orders because communicating 
with the delivery drivers was difficult when they were 
on the road.
PepsiCo North America Beverages created a  custom 
in-house app for the iPhone called Power4Merch, 
which immediately notifies merchandisers when 
a driver has arrived at a store. The merchandiser’s 
iPhone has an electronic timecard, and he can see his 
schedule, the store details, the account profiles, and 
everything he needs to know to service the store.
PepsiCo managers use iPads with custom 
 applications to monitor their teams’ performance; 
pull up pricing, planograms and contracts; and 
help  coordinate deliveries with merchandising. 
The Manager’s Briefcase app provides territory 
sales  managers with electronic versions of all the 
 paperwork and resources they need to manage their 
teams,  including store audits, employee coaching 
forms, and automated notifications to merchandis-
ers. A manager can make manpower assignments 
directly on the iPad. The iPad automatically sends a 
notification to the merchandiser’s iPhone informing 
him he has an additional stop to make, for example. 
In the past, managers had to spend much of their 
time on the phone, checking email in the office, and 
 checking paperwork. With the iPad, the manager 
starts and ends his day with his team.

great disparities in economic and scientific development. The world trade that 
ensued after Columbus’s voyages has brought these peoples and cultures closer. 
The “industrial revolution” was really a world-wide phenomenon energized by 
expansion of trade among nations and the emergence of the first global economy.
In 2005, journalist Thomas Friedman wrote an influential book declar-
ing the world was now “flat,” by which he meant that the Internet and global 
 communications had greatly reduced the economic and cultural advantages of 
 developed countries. Friedman argued that the U.S. and European countries 
were in a fight for their economic lives, competing for jobs, markets, resources, 
and even ideas with highly educated, motivated populations in low-wage areas 
in the less developed world (Friedman, 2007). This “globalization” presents both 
 challenges and opportunities for business firms
A growing percentage of the economy of the United States and other advanced 
industrial countries in Europe and Asia depends on imports and exports. In 
2013, more than 33 percent of the U.S. economy resulted from  foreign trade, 
both imports and exports. In Europe and Asia, the number exceeded 50  percent. 
Many Fortune 500 U.S. firms derive half their revenues from foreign opera-
tions. For instance, 85 percent of Intel’s revenues in 2013 came from overseas 
sales of its microprocessors. Eighty percent of the toys sold in the United States 
are manufactured in China, while about 90 percent of the PCs  manufactured in 
China use American-made Intel or Advanced Micro Design (AMD) chips. The 
microprocessor chips are shipped from the United States to China for assembly 
into devices. In the severe recession of 2008-2011, all the world’s economies 
were negatively impacted. 
It’s not just goods that move across borders. So too do jobs, some of them 
high-level jobs that pay well and require a college degree. In the past decade, 
the United States lost several million manufacturing jobs to offshore, low-wage 
producers. But manufacturing is now a very small part of U.S. employment 
(less than 12  percent and declining). In a normal year, about 300,000 service 
jobs move  offshore to lower wage countries. Many of the jobs are in  less-skilled 
information system occupations, but some are “tradable service” jobs in 
 architecture, financial services, customer call centers, consulting,  engineering, 
and even radiology.
On the plus side, the U.S. economy  creates over 3.5 million new jobs in a 
normal, non-recessionary year. However, only 1.1 million private sector jobs 
were created due to slow recovery in 2011, but by 2014 2.5 million jobs were 
added. Employment in information  systems and the other service occupations 
is expanding, and wages are stable. Outsourcing has actually accelerated the 
development of new systems in the United States and worldwide.
The challenge for you as a business student is to develop high-level skills 
through education and on-the-job experience that cannot be outsourced. The 
challenge for your business is to avoid markets for goods and services that can 
be produced offshore much less expensively. The opportunities are equally 
immense. Throughout this book, you will find examples of companies and 
 individuals who either failed or succeeded in using information systems to 
adapt to this new global environment.
What does globalization have to do with management information  systems? 
That’s simple: everything. The emergence of the Internet into a full-blown 
 international communications system has drastically reduced the costs of 
 operating and transacting on a global scale. Communication between a  factory 
floor in Shanghai and a distribution center in Rapid City, South Dakota, is 
now instant and virtually free. Customers can now shop in a worldwide 
 marketplace, obtaining price and quality information reliably 24 hours a day. 
 
Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today 
43

Firms producing goods and services on a global scale achieve extraordinary cost 
reductions by finding low-cost suppliers and managing production facilities 
in other  countries. Internet service firms, such as Google and eBay, are able 
to replicate their  business models and services in multiple countries without 
having to redesign their expensive fixed-cost information systems infrastruc-
ture. Half of the revenue of eBay (as well as General Motors) originates outside 
the United States. Briefly, information systems enable globalization.
THE EMERGING DIGITAL FIRM
All of the changes we have just described, coupled with equally significant 
 organizational redesign, have created the conditions for a fully digital firm. A 
digital firm can be defined along several dimensions. A digital firm is one 
in which nearly all of the organization’s significant business relationships with 
 customers, suppliers, and employees are digitally enabled and mediated. Core 
business  processes are accomplished through digital networks spanning the 
entire organization or linking multiple organizations.
Business processes refer to the set of logically related tasks and  behaviors 
that organizations develop over time to produce specific business results and 
the unique manner in which these activities are organized and coordinated. 
Developing a new product, generating and fulfilling an order, creating a 
 marketing plan, and hiring an employee are examples of business processes, 
and the ways organizations accomplish their business processes can be a source 
of competitive strength. (A detailed discussion of business processes can be 
found in Chapter 2.)
Key corporate assets—intellectual property, core competencies, and financial 
and human assets—are managed through digital means. In a digital firm, any 
piece of information required to support key business decisions is available at 
any time and anywhere in the firm.
Digital firms sense and respond to their environments far more rapidly than 
traditional firms, giving them more flexibility to survive in turbulent times. Digital 
firms offer extraordinary opportunities for more flexible global organization and 
management. In digital firms, both time shifting and space shifting are the norm. 
Time shifting refers to business being conducted continuously, 24/7, rather than 
in narrow “work day” time bands of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Space shifting means that 
work takes place in a global workshop, as well as within national boundaries. 
Work is accomplished physically wherever in the world it is best accomplished.
Many firms, such as Cisco Systems, 3M, and IBM, are close to becoming 
 digital firms, using the Internet to drive every aspect of their business. Most 
other companies are not fully digital, but they are moving toward close digital 
integration with suppliers, customers, and employees.
STRATEGIC BUSINESS OBJECTIVES OF INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS
What makes information systems so essential today? Why are businesses 
 investing so much in information systems and technologies? In the United 
States, more than 21 million managers and 154 million workers in the informa-
tion and knowledge sectors in the labor force rely on information systems to 
conduct business. Information systems are essential for conducting day-to-day 
business in the United States and most other advanced countries, as well as 
achieving strategic business objectives.
44 
Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

Entire sectors of the economy are nearly inconceivable without substantial 
investments in information systems. E-commerce firms such as Amazon, eBay, 
Google, and E*Trade simply would not exist. Today’s service industries—finance, 
insurance, and real estate, as well as personal services such as travel, medicine, 
and education—could not operate without information systems. Similarly, retail 
firms such as Walmart and Sears and manufacturing firms such as General Motors 
and General Electric require information systems to survive and prosper. Just as 
offices, telephones, filing cabinets, and efficient tall buildings with elevators were 
once the foundations of business in the twentieth  century, information technol-
ogy is a foundation for business in the twenty-first century.
There is a growing interdependence between a firm’s ability to use informa-
tion technology and its ability to implement corporate strategies and achieve 
 corporate goals (see Figure 1.2). What a business would like to do in five years 
often depends on what its systems will be able to do. Increasing market share, 
becoming the high-quality or low-cost producer, developing new products, and 
increasing employee productivity depend more and more on the kinds and 
 quality of information systems in the organization. The more you understand 
about this relationship, the more valuable you will be as a manager.
Specifically, business firms invest heavily in information systems to achieve 
six strategic business objectives: operational excellence; new products, services, 
and business models; customer and supplier intimacy; improved decision 
 making; competitive advantage; and survival.
Operational Excellence
Businesses continuously seek to improve the efficiency of their operations in 
order to achieve higher profitability. Information systems and technologies are 
some of the most important tools available to managers for achieving higher 
FIGURE 1.2 
THE INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS AND 
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
In contemporary systems, there is a growing interdependence between a firm’s information systems 
and its business capabilities. Changes in strategy, rules, and business processes increasingly require 
changes in hardware, software, databases, and telecommunications. Often, what the organization 
would like to do depends on what its systems will permit it to do.
 
Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today

levels of efficiency and productivity in business operations, especially when 
coupled with changes in business practices and management behavior.
Walmart, the largest retailer on earth, exemplifies the power of information 
systems coupled with brilliant business practices and supportive  management 
to achieve world-class operational efficiency. In fiscal year 2014, Walmart 
achieved $473 billion in sales—nearly one-tenth of retail sales in the United 
States—in large part because of its Retail Link system, which digitally links its 
suppliers to every one of Walmart’s stores. As soon as a customer purchases 
an item, the supplier monitoring the item knows to ship a replacement to the 
shelf. Walmart is the most efficient retail store in the industry, achieving sales 
of more than $428 per square foot, compared to its closest competitor, Target, 
at $295 a square foot. Other less efficient general merchandise stores generate 
from $150 to $200 a square foot. 
New Products, Services, and Business Models
Information systems and technologies are a major enabling tool for firms to 
create new products and services, as well as entirely new business models. 
A business model describes how a company produces, delivers, and sells a 
 product or service to create wealth.
Today’s music industry is vastly different from the industry a decade ago. 
Apple Inc. transformed an old business model of music distribution based on 
vinyl records, tapes, and CDs into an online, legal distribution model based 
on its own iPod technology platform. Apple has prospered from a continuing 
stream of iPod innovations, including the iTunes music service, the iPad, and 
the iPhone.
Customer and Supplier Intimacy
When a business really knows its customers, and serves them well, the custom-
ers generally respond by returning and purchasing more. This raises revenues 
and profits. Likewise with suppliers: the more a business engages its  suppliers, 
the better the suppliers can provide vital inputs. This lowers costs. How to 
really know your customers, or suppliers, is a central problem for businesses 
with millions of offline and online customers.
The Mandarin Oriental in Manhattan and other high-end hotels exemplify 
the use of information systems and technologies to achieve customer  intimacy. 
These hotels use computers to keep track of guests’ preferences, such as 
their preferred room temperature, check-in time, frequently dialed  telephone 
 numbers, and television programs, and store these data in a large data 
 repository. Individual rooms in the hotels are networked to a central network 
server computer so that they can be remotely monitored or controlled. When a 
customer arrives at one of these hotels, the system automatically changes the 
room conditions, such as dimming the lights, setting the room temperature, or 
selecting appropriate music, based on the customer’s digital profile. The hotels 
also analyze their customer data to identify their best customers and to develop 
individualized marketing campaigns based on customers’ preferences.
JCPenney exemplifies the benefits of information systems-enabled supplier 
intimacy. Every time a dress shirt is bought at a JCPenney store in the United 
States, the record of the sale appears immediately on computers in Hong Kong 
at the TAL Apparel Ltd. supplier, a contract manufacturer that produces one 
in eight dress shirts sold in the United States. TAL runs the numbers through a 
computer model it developed and then decides how many replacement shirts 
to make, and in what styles, colors, and sizes. TAL then sends the shirts to 
46 
Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

each JCPenney store, bypassing completely the retailer’s warehouses. In other 
words, JCPenney’s shirt inventory is near zero, as is the cost of storing it.
Improved Decision Making
Many business managers operate in an information fog bank, never really 
having the right information at the right time to make an informed decision. 
Instead, managers rely on forecasts, best guesses, and luck. The result is over- 
or underproduction of goods and services, misallocation of resources, and 
poor response times. These poor outcomes raise costs and lose customers. 
In the past decade, information systems and technologies have made it pos-
sible for managers to use real-time data from the marketplace when making 
decisions.
For instance, Verizon Corporation, one of the largest telecommunication 
companies in the United States, uses a Web-based digital dashboard to pro-
vide managers with precise real-time information on customer complaints, 
network performance for each locality served, and line outages or storm-dam-
aged lines. Using this information, managers can immediately allocate repair 
resources to affected areas, inform consumers of repair efforts, and restore 
service fast.
Competitive Advantage
When firms achieve one or more of these business objectives—operational 
excellence; new products, services, and business models; customer/supplier 
intimacy; and improved decision making—chances are they have already 
achieved a competitive advantage. Doing things better than your competitors, 
charging less for superior products, and responding to customers and suppliers 
in real time all add up to higher sales and higher profits that your competitors 
cannot match. Apple Inc., Walmart, and UPS, described later in this chapter, are 
industry leaders because they know how to use information systems for this 
purpose.
Survival
Business firms also invest in information systems and technologies because 
they are necessities of doing business. Sometimes these “necessities” are driven 
by industry-level changes. For instance, after Citibank introduced the first 
 automated teller machines (ATMs) in the New York region in 1977 to attract 
customers through higher service levels, its competitors rushed to provide ATMs 
to their customers to keep up with Citibank. Today, virtually all banks in the 
United States have regional ATMs and link to national and international ATM 
networks, such as CIRRUS. Providing ATM services to retail banking customers 
is simply a requirement of being in and surviving in the retail banking business.
There are many federal and state statutes and regulations that create a legal 
duty for companies and their employees to retain records, including digital 
records. For instance, the Toxic Substances Control Act (1976), which regulates 
the exposure of U.S. workers to more than 75,000 toxic chemicals, requires 
firms to retain records on employee exposure for 30 years. The Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act (2002), which was intended to improve the accountability of public firms 
and their auditors, requires certified public accounting firms that audit public 
 companies to retain audit working papers and records, including all e-mails, for 
five years. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
(2010) which was intended to strengthen regulation of the banking industry 
requires firms to retain all records for ten years. Many other pieces of federal 
 
Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today 
47

and state legislation in health care, financial services, education, and privacy 
protection impose significant  information retention and reporting require-
ments on U.S. businesses. Firms turn to information systems and technologies 
to provide the capability to respond to these challenges.
1.2  
WHAT IS AN INFORMATION SYSTEM? HOW DOES 
IT WORK? WHAT ARE ITS MANAGEMENT, 
ORGANIZATION, AND TECHNOLOGY COMPONENTS 
AND WHY ARE COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS 
ESSENTIAL FOR ENSURING THAT INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS PROVIDE GENUINE VALUE FOR AN 
ORGANIZATION?
So far we’ve used information systems and technologies informally with-
out  defining the terms. Information technology (IT) consists of all the 
 hardware and  software that a firm needs to use in order to achieve its busi-
ness  objectives. This includes not only computer machines, storage devices, 
and handheld mobile devices, but also software, such as the Windows or Linux 
 operating  systems, the Microsoft Office desktop productivity suite, and the 
many thousands of computer programs that can be found in a typical large 
firm. “Information systems” are more complex and can be best understood by 
looking at them from both a technology and a business perspective.
WHAT IS AN INFORMATION SYSTEM?
An information system can be defined technically as a set of interrelated 
components that collect (or retrieve), process, store, and distribute information 
to support decision making and control in an organization. In addition to sup-
porting decision making, coordination, and control, information systems may 
also help managers and workers analyze problems, visualize complex subjects, 
and create new products.
Information systems contain information about significant people, places, 
and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it. 
By information we mean data that have been shaped into a form that is 
 meaningful and useful to human beings. Data, in contrast, are streams of raw 
facts representing events occurring in organizations or the physical environ-
ment before they have been organized and arranged into a form that people can 
understand and use.
A brief example contrasting information and data may prove useful. 
Supermarket checkout counters scan millions of pieces of data from bar 
codes, which describe each product. Such pieces of data can be totaled and 
analyzed to provide meaningful information, such as the total number of 
bottles of dish detergent sold at a particular store, which brands of dish deter-
gent were selling the most rapidly at that store or sales territory, or the total 
amount spent on that brand of dish detergent at that store or sales region 
(see Figure 1.3).
Three activities in an information system produce the information that 
organizations need to make decisions, control operations, analyze problems, 
and create new products or services. These activities are input, processing, 
and output (see Figure 1.4). Input captures or collects raw data from within 
48 
Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

the organization or from its external environment. Processing converts this 
raw input into a meaningful form. Output transfers the processed informa-
tion to the people who will use it or to the activities for which it will be used. 
 FIGURE 1.4 
FUNCTIONS OF AN INFORMATION SYSTEM
An information system contains information about an organization and its surrounding environment. 
Three basic activities—input, processing, and output—produce the information organizations need. 
Feedback is output returned to appropriate people or activities in the organization to evaluate and 
refine the input. Environmental actors, such as customers, suppliers, competitors, stockholders, and 
regulatory agencies, interact with the organization and its information systems.
 FIGURE 1.3 
 DATA AND INFORMATION 
Raw data from a supermarket checkout counter can be processed and organized to produce meaningful information, such 
as the total unit sales of dish detergent or the total sales revenue from dish detergent for a specific store or sales territory.
 
Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today 
49

Information systems also require feedback, which is output that is returned to 
appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate or correct the 
input stage.
In a professional sports team’s system for selling tickets, the raw input con-
sists of order data for tickets, such as the purchaser’s name, address, credit card 
number, number of tickets ordered, and the date of the game for which the 
ticket is being purchased. Another input would be the ticket price, which would 
fluctuate based on computer analysis of how much could optimally be charged 
for a ticket for a particular game. Computers store these data and process them 
to calculate order totals, to track ticket purchases, and to send requests for 
payment to credit card companies. The output consists of tickets to print out, 
receipts for orders, and reports on online ticket orders. The system provides 
meaningful information, such as the number of tickets sold for a particular 
game or at a particular price, the total number of tickets sold each year, and 
frequent customers.
Although computer-based information systems use computer technology 
to process raw data into meaningful information, there is a sharp distinction 
between a computer and a computer program on the one hand, and an infor-
mation system on the other. Electronic computers and related software pro-
grams are the technical foundation, the tools and materials, of modern infor-
mation systems. Computers provide the equipment for storing and  processing 
information. Computer programs, or software, are sets of operating instructions 
that direct and control computer processing. Knowing how computers and 
computer programs work is important in designing solutions to organizational 
problems, but computers are only part of an information system.
A house is an appropriate analogy. Houses are built with hammers, nails, 
and wood, but these do not make a house. The architecture, design, setting, 
 landscaping, and all of the decisions that lead to the creation of these  features 
are part of the house and are crucial for solving the problem of putting a 
roof over one’s head. Computers and programs are the hammers, nails, and 
lumber of computer-based information systems, but alone they cannot produce 
the information a particular organization needs. To understand information 
 systems, you must understand the problems they are designed to solve, their 
architectural and design elements, and the organizational processes that lead to 
these solutions.
DIMENSIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS
To fully understand information systems, you must understand the broader 
organization, management, and information technology dimensions of 
 systems (see Figure 1.5) and their power to provide solutions to  challenges 
and problems in the business environment. We refer to this broader under-
standing of information systems, which encompasses an understanding 
of the management and organizational dimensions of systems as well as 
the technical dimensions of systems, as information systems  literacy. 
Computer literacy, in contrast, focuses primarily on knowledge of 
 information technology.
The field of management information systems (MIS) tries to achieve this 
broader information systems literacy. MIS deals with behavioral issues as well 
as technical issues surrounding the development, use, and impact of informa-
tion systems used by managers and employees in the firm.
Let’s examine each of the dimensions of information systems—organizations, 
management, and information technology.
50 
Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

Organizations
Information systems are an integral part of organizations. Indeed, for some 
 companies, such as credit reporting firms, there would be no business without an 
information system. The key elements of an organization are its people,  structure, 
business processes, politics, and culture. We introduce these components of orga-
nizations here and describe them in greater detail in Chapters 2 and 3.
Organizations have a structure that is composed of different levels and 
 specialties. Their structures reveal a clear-cut division of labor. Authority and 
responsibility in a business firm are organized as a hierarchy, or a pyramid struc-
ture. The upper levels of the hierarchy consist of managerial, professional, and 
technical employees, whereas the lower levels consist of operational personnel.
Senior management makes long-range strategic decisions about products 
and services as well as ensures financial performance of the firm. Middle 
management carries out the programs and plans of senior management, 
and operational management is responsible for monitoring the daily activi-
ties of the business. Knowledge workers, such as engineers, scientists, or 
 architects, design products or services and create new knowledge for the firm, 
whereas data workers, such as secretaries or clerks, assist with scheduling 
and  communications at all levels of the firm. Production or service workers 
 actually produce the product and deliver the service (see Figure 1.6).
Experts are employed and trained for different business functions. The major 
business functions, or specialized tasks performed by business organizations, 
consist of sales and marketing, manufacturing and production, finance and 
accounting, and human resources (see Table 1.2). Chapter 2 provides more 
detail on these business functions and the ways in which they are supported by 
information systems.
An organization coordinates work through its hierarchy and through its 
 business processes, which are logically related tasks and behaviors for 
 accomplishing work. Developing a new product, fulfilling an order, and hiring a 
new employee are examples of business processes.

 INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE MORE THAN COMPUTERS
Using information systems effectively requires an understanding of the organization, management, 
and information technology shaping the systems. An information system creates value for the firm as 
an organizational and management solution to challenges posed by the environment.
 
Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today

Most organizations’ business processes include formal rules that have 
been developed over a long time for accomplishing tasks. These rules guide 
employees in a variety of procedures, from writing an invoice to responding 
to customer complaints. Some of these business processes have been writ-
ten down, but others are informal work practices, such as a requirement to 
return telephone calls from coworkers or customers, that are not formally 
documented. Information systems automate many business processes. For 
instance, how a customer receives credit or how a customer is billed is often 
determined by an information system that incorporates a set of formal busi-
ness processes.
Each organization has a unique culture, or fundamental set of assumptions, 
values, and ways of doing things, that has been accepted by most of its  members. 
You can see organizational culture at work by looking around your university or 
college. Some bedrock assumptions of university life are that professors know 
more than students, the reasons students attend college is to learn, and that 
classes follow a regular schedule.

 LEVELS IN A FIRM
Business organizations are hierarchies consisting of three principal levels: senior management, middle 
management, and operational management. Information systems serve each of these levels. Scientists 
and knowledge workers often work with middle management.

Parts of an organization’s culture can always be found embedded in its 
 information systems. For instance, UPS’s first priority is customer service, which 
is an aspect of its organizational culture that can be found in the  company’s 
package tracking systems, which we describe later in this section.
Different levels and specialties in an organization create different interests 
and points of view. These views often conflict over how the company should be 
run and how resources and rewards should be distributed. Conflict is the basis 
for organizational politics. Information systems come out of this  cauldron of dif-
fering perspectives, conflicts, compromises, and agreements that are a  natural 
part of all organizations. In Chapter 3, we examine these features of organiza-
tions and their role in the development of information systems in greater detail.
Management
Management’s job is to make sense out of the many situations faced by 
 organizations, make decisions, and formulate action plans to solve organiza-
tional problems. Managers perceive business challenges in the environment; 
they set the organizational strategy for responding to those challenges; and 
they allocate the human and financial resources to coordinate the work and 
achieve success. Throughout, they must exercise responsible leadership. The 
business information systems described in this book reflect the hopes, dreams, 
and  realities of real-world managers.
But managers must do more than manage what already exists. They must 
also create new products and services and even re-create the organization from 
time to time. A substantial part of management responsibility is creative work 
driven by new knowledge and information. Information technology can play a 
powerful role in helping managers design and deliver new products and  services 
and redirecting and redesigning their organizations. Chapter 12 treats manage-
ment decision making in detail.
Information Technology
Information technology is one of many tools managers use to cope with change. 
Computer hardware is the physical equipment used for input, processing, and 
output activities in an information system. It consists of the following: comput-
ers of various sizes and shapes (including mobile handheld devices); various 
input, output, and storage devices; and telecommunications devices that link 
computers together.
Computer software consists of the detailed, preprogrammed instructions 
that control and coordinate the computer hardware components in an informa-
tion system. Chapter 5 describes the contemporary software and hardware 
 platforms used by firms today in greater detail.
Data management technology consists of the software governing the 
 organization of data on physical storage media. More detail on data organization 
and access methods can be found in Chapter 6.
Networking and telecommunications technology, consisting of both 
physical devices and software, links the various pieces of hardware and transfers 
data from one physical location to another. Computers and communications 
equipment can be connected in networks for sharing voice, data, images, sound, 
and video. A network links two or more computers to share data or resources, 
such as a printer.
The world’s largest and most widely used network is the Internet. The 
Internet is a global “network of networks” that uses universal standards 
(described in Chapter 7) to connect millions of different networks with nearly 3 
billion users in over 230 countries around the world.
 
Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today 
53

The Internet has created a new “universal” technology platform on which to 
build new products, services, strategies, and business models. This same 
 technology platform has internal uses, providing the connectivity to link differ-
ent systems and networks within the firm. Internal corporate networks based 
on Internet technology are called intranets. Private intranets extended to 
authorized users outside the organization are called extranets, and firms use 
such networks to coordinate their activities with other firms for making 
 purchases, collaborating on design, and other interorganizational work. For 
most business firms today, using Internet technology is both a business 
 necessity and a competitive advantage.
The World Wide Web is a service provided by the Internet that uses univer-
sally accepted standards for storing, retrieving, formatting, and displaying infor-
mation in a page format on the Internet. Web pages contain text, graphics, anima-
tions, sound, and video and are linked to other Web pages. By clicking on 
highlighted words or buttons on a Web page, you can link to related pages to find 
additional information and links to other locations on the Web. The Web can 
serve as the foundation for new kinds of information systems such as UPS’s Web-
based package tracking system described in the following Interactive Session.
All of these technologies, along with the people required to run and  manage 
them, represent resources that can be shared throughout the organization and 
constitute the firm’s information technology (IT) infrastructure. The IT 
infrastructure provides the foundation, or platform, on which the firm can build 
its specific information systems. Each organization must carefully design and 
manage its IT infrastructure so that it has the set of technology services it needs 
for the work it wants to accomplish with information systems. Chapters 5 
through 8 of this book examine each major technology component of informa-
tion technology infrastructure and show how they all work together to create 
the technology platform for the organization.
The Interactive Session on Technology describes some of the typical 
 technologies used in computer-based information systems today. UPS invests 
heavily in information systems technology to make its business more efficient 
and customer oriented. It uses an array of information technologies, including 
bar code scanning systems, wireless networks, large mainframe computers, 
handheld computers, the Internet, and many different pieces of software for 
tracking packages, calculating fees, maintaining customer accounts, and 
 managing logistics.
Let’s identify the organization, management, and technology elements in the 
UPS package tracking system we have just described. The organization  element 
anchors the package tracking system in UPS’s sales and production functions 
(the main product of UPS is a service—package delivery). It specifies the 
required procedures for identifying packages with both sender and recipient 
information, taking inventory, tracking the packages en route, and providing 
package status reports for UPS customers and customer service representatives.
The system must also provide information to satisfy the needs of manag-
ers and workers. UPS drivers need to be trained in both package pickup and 
 delivery procedures and in how to use the package tracking system so that they 
can work efficiently and effectively. UPS customers may need some training to 
use UPS in-house package tracking software or the UPS Web site.
UPS’s management is responsible for monitoring service levels and costs 
and for promoting the company’s strategy of combining low cost and superior 
 service. Management decided to use computer systems to increase the ease 
of sending a package using UPS and of checking its delivery status, thereby 
 reducing delivery costs and increasing sales revenues.

Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

United Parcel Service (UPS) started out in 1907 in a 
closet-sized basement office. Jim Casey and Claude 
Ryan—two teenagers from Seattle with two bicycles 
and one phone—promised the “best service and 
 lowest rates.” UPS has used this formula successfully 
for more than a century to become the world’s larg-
est ground and air package-delivery company. It’s 
a global enterprise with nearly 400,000 employees, 
96,000 vehicles, and the world’s ninth largest airline.
Today UPS delivers 16.3 million packages and 
documents each day in the United States and more 
than 220 other countries and territories. The firm 
has been able to maintain leadership in small-pack-
age delivery services despite stiff competition from 
FedEx and Airborne Express by investing heavily in 
advanced information technology. UPS spends more 
than $1 billion each year to maintain a high level 
of customer service while keeping costs low and 
streamlining its overall operations.
It all starts with the scannable bar-coded label 
attached to a package, which contains detailed 
 information about the sender, the destination, and 
when the package should arrive. Customers can 
download and print their own labels using spe-
cial software provided by UPS or by accessing the 
UPS Web site. Before the package is even picked 
up,  information from the “smart” label is transmit-
ted to one of UPS’s computer centers in Mahwah, 
New Jersey, or Alpharetta, Georgia and sent to the 
 distribution center nearest its final destination. 
Dispatchers at this center download the label data 
and use special software to create the most efficient 
delivery route for each driver that considers traffic, 
weather conditions, and the location of each stop. 
In 2009, UPS began installing sensors in its delivery 
vehicles that can capture the truck’s speed and loca-
tion, the number of times it’s placed in reverse and 
whether the driver’s seat belt is buckled. At the end 
of each day, these data are uploaded to a UPS central 
computer and analyzed. By combining GPS informa-
tion and data from fuel-efficiency sensors installed 
on more than 46,000 vehicles in 2011, UPS reduced 
fuel consumption by 8.4 million gallons and cut 85 
million miles off its routes. UPS estimates that  saving 
only one daily mile driven per driver saves the 
 company $30 million.
The first thing a UPS driver picks up each day is 
a handheld computer called a Delivery Information 
I NTE R A C T IV E  S E S S IO N : T E C H N O L O G Y
UPS COMPETES GLOBALLY WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Acquisition Device (DIAD), which can access a 
 wireless cell phone network. As soon as the driver 
logs on, his or her day’s route is downloaded onto 
the handheld. The DIAD also automatically captures 
customers’ signatures along with pickup and delivery 
information. Package tracking information is then 
transmitted to UPS’s computer network for storage 
and processing. From there, the information can 
be accessed worldwide to provide proof of delivery 
to customers or to respond to customer queries. It 
 usually takes less than 60 seconds from the time a 
driver presses “complete” on a the DIAD for the new 
information to be available on the Web.
Through its automated package tracking  system, 
UPS can monitor and even re-route packages 
throughout the delivery process. At various points 
along the route from sender to receiver, bar code 
devices scan shipping information on the pack-
age label and feed data about the progress of the 
package into the central computer. Customer ser-
vice  representatives are able to check the status 
of any package from desktop computers linked to 
the  central computers and respond immediately to 
 inquiries from customers. UPS customers can also 
access this information from the company’s Web 
site using their own computers or mobile phones. 
UPS now has mobile apps and a mobile Web site for 
iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android smartphone users. 
Anyone with a package to ship can access the UPS 
Web site to track packages, check delivery routes, 
 calculate shipping rates, determine time in tran-
sit, print labels, and schedule a pickup. The data 
 collected at the UPS Web site are transmitted to the 
UPS central computer and then back to the customer 
after processing. UPS also provides tools that enable 
customers, such Cisco Systems, to embed UPS func-
tions, such as tracking and cost calculations, into 
their own Web sites so that they can track shipments 
without visiting the UPS site.
A Web-based Post Sales Order Management System 
(OMS) manages global service orders and inventory 
for critical parts fulfillment. The system enables 
 high-tech electronics, aerospace, medical equip-
ment, and other companies anywhere in the world 
that ship critical parts to quickly assess their critical 
parts inventory, determine the most optimal routing 
strategy to meet customer needs, place orders online, 
and track parts from the warehouse to the end user.

1. What are the inputs, processing, and outputs of 
UPS’s package tracking system? 
2.  What technologies are used by UPS? How are these 
technologies related to UPS’s business strategy? 
An automated e-mail or fax feature keeps customers 
informed of each shipping milestone and can provide 
notification of any changes to flight schedules for 
commercial airlines carrying their parts. 
UPS is now leveraging its decades of expertise 
managing its own global delivery network to manage 
logistics and supply chain activities for other compa-
nies. It created a UPS Supply Chain Solutions division 
that provides a complete bundle of standardized ser-
vices to subscribing companies at a fraction of what it 
would cost to build their own systems and infrastruc-
ture. These services include supply-chain design and 
management, freight forwarding, customs brokerage, 
mail services, multimodal transportation, and finan-
cial services, in addition to logistics services. 
For example, UPS handles logistics for Lighting 
Science Group, the world’s leading maker of advanced 
light products such as energy-efficient light-emitting 
diode (LED) lamps and custom design lighting 
 systems. The company has manufacturing opera-
tions in Satellite Beach, Florida and China. UPS con-
ducted a warehouse/distribution analysis to shape 
the  manufacturer’s distribution strategy, in which 
finished goods from China are brought to a UPS 
warehouse in Fort Worth, Texas, for distribution. The 
UPS  warehouse repackages finished goods, handles 
returns and conducts daily cycle counts as well as 
annual inventory. Lighting Science uses UPS Trade 
Management Services and UPS Customs Brokerage to 
help manage import and export compliance to ensure 
timely, reliable delivery and reduce customs delays. 
UPS also helps Lighting Science reduce customer 
inventory and improve order fulfillment.
UPS manages logistics and international shipping 
for Celaris, the world’s largest wireless accessory 
vendor, selling mobile phone cases, headphones, 
screen protectors, and chargers. Cellaris has nearly 
1,000 franchises in the United States, Canada and 
the United Kingdom. The company’s supply chain 
is complex, with products developed in Georgia, 
manufactured at more than 25 locations in Asia and 
10 locations in the U.S., warehoused in a Georgia 
distribution center, and shipped to franchisees and 
customers worldwide. UPS redesigned Celaris’s 
inbound/outbound supply chain and introduced 
new services to create a more efficient shipping 
model. UPS Buyer Consolidation for International 
Air Freight reduces complexity in dealing with 
multiple international manufacturing sources. UPS 
Worldwide Express Freight guarantees  on-time 
 service for critical freight pallet shipments and 
UPS Customs Brokerage enables single-source 
 clearance for multiple transportation modes. These 
changes have saved Celaris more than 5,000 hours 
and $500,000 annually, and the supply chain 
 redesign alone has saved more than 15 percent on 
 shipments.

IT ISN’T JUST TECHNOLOGY: A BUSINESS 
PERSPECTIVE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Managers and business firms invest in information technology and systems 
because they provide real economic value to the business. The decision to build 
or maintain an information system assumes that the returns on this invest-
ment will be superior to other investments in buildings, machines, or other 
assets. These superior returns will be expressed as increases in productivity, 
as increases in revenues (which will increase the firm’s stock market value), 
or perhaps as superior long-term strategic positioning of the firm in certain 
 markets (which produce superior revenues in the future).
We can see that from a business perspective, an information system is an 
important instrument for creating value for the firm. Information  systems 
enable the firm to increase its revenue or decrease its costs by providing 
 information that helps managers make better decisions or that improves the 
execution of business processes. For example, the information system for 
 analyzing supermarket checkout data illustrated in Figure 1.3 can increase firm 
profitability by helping managers make better decisions as to which products to 
stock and promote in retail supermarkets.
Every business has an information value chain, illustrated in Figure 1.7, in 
which raw information is systematically acquired and then transformed through 
various stages that add value to that information. The value of an information 
system to a business, as well as the decision to invest in any new information 
system, is, in large part, determined by the extent to which the system will lead 
to better management decisions, more efficient business processes, and higher 
firm profitability. Although there are other reasons why systems are built, their 
primary purpose is to contribute to corporate value.
From a business perspective, information systems are part of a series of 
value-adding activities for acquiring, transforming, and distributing informa-
tion that managers can use to improve decision making, enhance organiza-
tional performance, and, ultimately, increase firm profitability.
The business perspective calls attention to the organizational and 
 managerial nature of information systems. An information system represents

an organizational and management solution, based on information technology, 
to a challenge or problem posed by the environment. Every chapter in this 
book begins with a short case study that illustrates this concept. A diagram at 
the beginning of each chapter illustrates the relationship between a business 
challenge and resulting management and organizational decisions to use IT as 
a solution to challenges generated by the business environment. You can use 
this diagram as a starting point for analyzing any information system or infor-
mation system problem you encounter.
Review the diagram at the beginning of this chapter. The diagram shows how 
the Rugby Football Union’s systems solved the business problem presented by 
the need to generate revenue in a highly competitive industry. These systems 
provide a solution that takes advantage of opportunities provided by new digital 
technology and the Internet. They opened up new channels for selling tickets 
and interacting with customers, optimized ticket pricing, and used new tools 
to analyze player performance. These systems were essential in improving the 
Union’s overall business performance. The diagram also illustrates how man-
agement, technology, and organizational elements work together to create the 
systems.

 FIGURE 1.8 
VARIATION IN RETURNS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
INVESTMENT
Although, on average, investments in information technology produce returns far above those returned 
by other investments, there is considerable variation across firms.

their information systems than others. Studies of returns from information 
technology investments show that there is considerable variation in the returns 
firms receive (see Figure 1.8). Some firms invest a great deal and receive a 
great deal (quadrant 2); others invest an equal amount and receive few returns 
( quadrant 4). Still other firms invest little and receive much (quadrant 1), 
whereas others invest little and receive little (quadrant 3). This suggests that 
investing in information technology does not by itself guarantee good returns. 
What accounts for this variation among firms?
The answer lies in the concept of complementary assets. Information 
 technology investments alone cannot make organizations and managers more 
effective unless they are accompanied by supportive values, structures, and 
behavior patterns in the organization and other complementary assets. Business 
firms need to change how they do business before they can really reap the 
advantages of new information technologies.
Some firms fail to adopt the right business model that suits the new 
 technology, or seek to preserve an old business model that is doomed by new 
technology. For instance, recording label companies refused to change their 
old business model, which was based on physical music stores for distribu-
tion rather than adopt a new online distribution model. As a result, online 
legal music sales are dominated not by record companies but by a technology 
 company called Apple Computer.
Complementary assets are those assets required to derive value from 
a  primary investment (Teece, 1988). For instance, to realize value from 
 automobiles requires substantial complementary investments in highways, 
roads,  gasoline stations, repair facilities, and a legal regulatory structure to set 
standards and control drivers.
Research indicates that firms that support their technology investments 
with investments in complementary assets, such as new business models, 
new business processes, management behavior, organizational culture, or 
 
Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today 
59

training, receive superior returns, whereas those firms failing to make these 
complementary investments receive less or no returns on their information 
technology investments (Brynjolfsson, 2003; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000; 
Laudon, 1974). These investments in organization and management are also 
known as organizational and management capital.
Table 1.3 lists the major complementary investments that firms need to 
make to realize value from their information technology investments. Some 
of this investment involves tangible assets, such as buildings, machinery, 
and tools. However, the value of investments in information technology 
depends to a large extent on complementary investments in management 
and organization.
Key organizational complementary investments are a supportive busi-
ness culture that values efficiency and effectiveness, an appropriate business 
model, efficient business processes, decentralization of authority, highly dis-
tributed decision rights, and a strong information system (IS) development 
team.
Important managerial complementary assets are strong senior management 
support for change, incentive systems that monitor and reward individual 
 innovation, an emphasis on teamwork and collaboration, training programs, 
and a management culture that values flexibility and knowledge.
Important social investments (not made by the firm but by the society at 
large, other firms, governments, and other key market actors) are the Internet 
and the supporting Internet culture, educational systems, network and comput-
ing standards, regulations and laws, and the presence of technology and service 
firms.
Throughout the book we emphasize a framework of analysis that considers 
technology, management, and organizational assets and their interactions. 
Perhaps the single most important theme in the book, reflected in case studies 
and exercises, is that managers need to consider the broader organization and

management dimensions of information systems to understand current 
 problems as well as to derive substantial above-average returns from their 
 information technology investments. As you will see throughout the text, firms 
that can address these related dimensions of the IT investment are, on average, 
richly rewarded.
1.3 
WHAT ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES ARE USED TO 
STUDY INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND HOW DOES 
EACH CONTRIBUTE TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF 
INFORMATION SYSTEMS?
The study of information systems is a multidisciplinary field. No single theory or 
perspective dominates. Figure 1.9 illustrates the major disciplines that contribute 
problems, issues, and solutions in the study of information systems. In general, 
the field can be divided into technical and behavioral approaches. Information 
systems are sociotechnical systems. Though they are composed of machines, 
devices, and “hard” physical technology, they require substantial social, organiza-
tional, and intellectual investments to make them work properly.
TECHNICAL APPROACH
The technical approach to information systems emphasizes mathematically 
based models to study information systems, as well as the physical technology 
and formal capabilities of these systems. The disciplines that contribute to the 
technical approach are computer science, management science, and operations 
research.
 FIGURE 1.9 
CONTEMPORARY APPROACHES TO INFORMATION SYSTEMS
The study of information systems deals with issues and insights contributed from technical and 
behavioral disciplines.
 
Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today 
61

Computer science is concerned with establishing theories of computabil-
ity, methods of computation, and methods of efficient data storage and access. 
Management science emphasizes the development of models for decision-mak-
ing and management practices. Operations research focuses on mathematical 
techniques for optimizing selected parameters of organizations, such as trans-
portation, inventory control, and transaction costs.
BEHAVIORAL APPROACH
An important part of the information systems field is concerned with  behavioral 
issues that arise in the development and long-term maintenance of information 
systems. Issues such as strategic business integration, design, implementation, 
utilization, and management cannot be explored usefully with the models used 
in the technical approach. Other behavioral disciplines contribute important 
concepts and methods.
For instance, sociologists study information systems with an eye toward 
how groups and organizations shape the development of systems and also 
how  systems affect individuals, groups, and organizations. Psychologists study 
 information systems with an interest in how human decision makers perceive 
and use formal information. Economists study information systems with an 
interest in understanding the production of digital goods, the dynamics of 
 digital markets, and how new information systems change the control and cost 
structures within the firm.
The behavioral approach does not ignore technology. Indeed, information 
systems technology is often the stimulus for a behavioral problem or issue. But 
the focus of this approach is generally not on technical solutions. Instead, it 
concentrates on changes in attitudes, management and organizational policy, 
and behavior.
APPROACH OF THIS TEXT: SOCIOTECHNICAL SYSTEMS
Throughout this book you will find a rich story with four main actors:  suppliers of 
hardware and software (the technologists); business firms making  investments 
and seeking to obtain value from the technology; managers and employees 
seeking to achieve business value (and other goals); and the  contemporary 
legal, social, and cultural context (the firm’s environment). Together these 
actors produce what we call management information systems.
The study of management information systems (MIS) arose to focus on the 
use of computer-based information systems in business firms and govern-
ment agencies. MIS combines the work of computer science, management 
 science, and operations research with a practical orientation toward developing 
system solutions to real-world problems and managing information technology 
resources. It is also concerned with behavioral issues surrounding the develop-
ment, use, and impact of information systems, which are typically discussed in 
the fields of sociology, economics, and psychology.
Our experience as academics and practitioners leads us to believe that no 
single approach effectively captures the reality of information systems. The 
 successes and failures of information are rarely all technical or all behavioral. 
Our best advice to students is to understand the perspectives of many  disciplines. 
Indeed, the challenge and excitement of the information systems field is that it 
requires an appreciation and tolerance of many different approaches.

The view we adopt in this book is best characterized as the sociotech-
nical view of systems. In this view, optimal organizational performance is 
achieved by jointly optimizing both the social and technical systems used in 
production.
Adopting a sociotechnical systems perspective helps to avoid a purely 
 technological approach to information systems. For instance, the fact that 
 information technology is rapidly declining in cost and growing in power does 
not necessarily or easily translate into productivity enhancement or bottom-
line profits. The fact that a firm has recently installed an enterprise-wide 
 financial reporting system does not necessarily mean that it will be used, or 
used effectively. Likewise, the fact that a firm has recently introduced new 
business procedures and processes does not necessarily mean employees will 
be more productive in the absence of investments in new information systems 
to enable those processes.
In this book, we stress the need to optimize the firm’s performance as a 
whole. Both the technical and behavioral components need attention. This 
means that technology must be changed and designed in such a way as to fit 
organizational and individual needs. Sometimes, the technology may have 
to be “de-optimized” to accomplish this fit. For instance, mobile phone users 
adapt this technology to their personal needs, and as a result manufactur-
ers quickly seek to adjust the technology to conform with user expectations. 
Organizations and individuals must also be changed through training, learn-
ing, and planned organizational change to allow the technology to  operate 
and prosper. Figure 1.10 illustrates this process of mutual adjustment in a 
sociotechnical system.
 FIGURE 1.10 A SOCIOTECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE ON INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS
In a sociotechnical perspective, the performance of a system is optimized when both the technology 
and the organization mutually adjust to one another until a satisfactory fit is obtained.

Review Summary
1. How are information systems transforming business, and why are they essential for running and 
managing a business today?
E-mail, online conferencing, smartphones, and tablet computers have become essential tools for 
conducting business. Information systems are the foundation of fast-paced supply chains. The 
Internet allows many businesses to buy, sell, advertise, and solicit customer feedback online. 
Organizations are trying to become more competitive and efficient by digitally enabling their core 
business processes and evolving into digital firms. The Internet has stimulated globalization by 
 dramatically reducing the costs of producing, buying, and selling goods on a global scale. New 
 information system trends include the emerging mobile digital platform, online software as a 
 service, and cloud computing.
Information systems are a foundation for conducting business today. In many industries, survival 
and the ability to achieve strategic business goals are difficult without extensive use of information 
technology. Businesses today use information systems to achieve six major objectives: operational 
excellence; new products, services, and business models; customer/supplier intimacy; improved 
 decision making; competitive advantage; and day-to-day survival.
2. What is an information system? How does it work? What are its management, organization, and 
 technology components and why are complementary assets essential for ensuring that information 
systems provide genuine value for organizations?
From a technical perspective, an information system collects, stores, and disseminates information 
from an organization’s environment and internal operations to support organizational functions and 
decision making, communication, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization. Information 
 systems transform raw data into useful information through three basic activities: input, processing, 
and output.
From a business perspective, an information system provides a solution to a problem or  challenge 
facing a firm and represents a combination of management, organization, and technology ele-
ments. The management dimension of information systems involves issues such as leadership, 
strategy, and management behavior. The technology dimension consists of computer hardware, 
software, data  management technology, and networking/telecommunications technology 
 (including the Internet). The organization dimension of information systems involves issues such 
as the organization’s  hierarchy, functional specialties, business processes, culture, and political 
interest groups.
In order to obtain meaningful value from information systems, organizations must support their 
technology investments with appropriate complementary investments in organizations and 
 management. These complementary assets include new business models and business processes, 
supportive organizational culture and management behavior, appropriate technology standards, 
 regulations, and laws. New information technology investments are unlikely to produce high returns 
unless  businesses make the appropriate managerial and organizational changes to support the 
 technology.
3. What academic disciplines are used to study information systems and how does each contribute to an 
understanding of information systems?
The study of information systems deals with issues and insights contributed from technical and 
behavioral disciplines. The disciplines that contribute to the technical approach focusing on formal 
models and capabilities of systems are computer science, management science, and operations 
research. The disciplines contributing to the behavioral approach focusing on the design, implementa-
tion, management, and business impact of systems are psychology, sociology, and economics. A 
 sociotechnical view of systems considers both technical and social features of systems and solutions 
that represent the best fit between them.

Management Decision Problems
1-7 
Warbenton Snack Foods is a manufacturer of potato crisps and savoury snacks in the U.K. Warbenton’s 
financial department uses spreadsheets and manual processes for much of its data gathering and report-
ing. Warbenton’s financial analyst would spend the entire final week of every month collecting spread-
sheets from the heads of various departments. She would then consolidate and re-enter all the data into 
another spreadsheet, which would serve as the company’s monthly profit and-loss statement. If a depart-
ment needed to update its data after submitting the spreadsheet to the main office, the analyst had to 
return the original spreadsheet and then wait for the department to resubmit its data before finally sub-
mitting the updated data in the consolidated document. Assess the impact of this situation on business 
performance and management decision making.

Rabatt operates deep-discount stores offering housewares, cleaning supplies, clothing, health and beauty 
aids, and packaged food throughout Germany, with most items selling for 1 euro. Its business model calls 
for keeping costs as low as possible. The company has no automated method for keeping track of inven-
tory at each store. Managers know approximately how many cases of a particular product the store is sup-
posed to receive when a delivery truck arrives, but the stores lack technology for scanning the cases or 
verifying the item count inside the cases. Merchandise losses from theft or other mishaps have been 
rising and now represent over 3 percent of total sales. What decisions have to be made before investing in 
an information system solution?

 In this project, you will start out with raw transactional sales data and use Microsoft Access database 
software to develop queries and reports that help managers make better decisions about product 
 pricing, sales promotions, and inventory replenishment. In MyMISLab, you can find a Store and 
Regional Sales Database developed in Microsoft Access. The database contains raw data on weekly 
store sales of  computer equipment in various sales regions. The database includes fields for store 
 identification number, sales region, item number, item description, unit price, units sold, and the 
weekly sales period when the sales were made. Use Access to develop some reports and queries to 
make this information more useful for running the business. Sales and production managers want 
answers to the following questions:
• 
Which products should be restocked?
• 
Which stores and sales regions would benefit from a promotional campaign and additional 
marketing?
• 
When (what time of year) should products be offered at full price, and when should discounts be 
used?

Mashaweer: Online Personal Services in the Gulf 
CASE STUDY
M
ashaweer is the first personal service 
company in Egypt. It’s purely dedicated 
to saving its clients’ time and effort by 
offering a personal assistant 24 hours 
a day. The personal assistant is a rider with a motor-
cycle who runs any errands for individual clients or 
corporations at any given time. The most common 
service they provide is buying groceries or other 
goods from stores, paying bills, and acting as a courier. 
Mashaweer’s success relies heavily on their flexibility, 
and they have often received unusual requests that 
they have fulfilled in order to gain customer loyalty, 
including: going to the gym to tell someone to turn on 
the phone as someone is trying to reach them, deliv-
ering presents to a client’s fiancée every 15 minutes, 
and carrying a client’s shopping bags from the car to 
the house. 
Mashaweer is an essential service for Egyptians 
because traffic is a problem that everyone in Egypt 
faces, making it difficult for an individual to get a 
couple of errands done on the same day. Mashaweer’s 
service has achieved such success in Alexandria and 
Cairo, where traffic is an issue, saving people one of 
the most valuable commodities out there: time. The 
service is  able to give people more quality time to 
spend with family or friends, instead of taking care 
of the daily errands that usually take up half of one’s 
day. They also act as a security or safety measure as 
they perform people’s errands in unsafe times, such 
as the period after the revolution or simply late at 
night. Most individuals cannot afford having a full-
time assistant to perform their errands whenever 
needed. Mashaweer’s agents act as full-time assistants 
for every individual at a part-time cost. 
Since starting the company in Alexandria in 2010, 
Mashaweer has since expanded to Cairo and oper-
ates around 600 orders per day. They plan to expand 
even further geographically within Egypt and to other 
countries in the region as well as enhancing and 
increasing the services they provide.
The idea of Mashaweer was created by Mohamed 
Wahid (24 years old) and then co-founded with his 
partners, Ahmed El Kordy (25 years old) and Aly El 
Shazly (27 years old). They were all born and raised

in Alexandria. Ahmed El Kordy and Mohamed Wahid 
met when they both transferred from different schools 
to IGCSE Academy (AAST) for high school. Ahmed El 
Kordy finished high school in 2 years and went on to 
achieve his bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering 
from the Arab Academy of Science and Technology 
(AAST), graduating in 2008. Part of his undergradu-
ate degree was spent doing a year abroad in Carleton 
University in Ottawa, Canada. During the summers 
of his undergraduate years, Ahmed completed sev-
eral internships in the United Kingdom and Ireland. 
Mohamed Wahid also went to AAST, graduating in 
2009 with a bachelor’s degree in construction engi-
neering. Aly El Shazly attended St. Marks School for 
his entire school career, he then went on to Alexandria 
University, where he studied business and graduated 
in 2007. After college, Ahmed El Kordy went on to 
work at his father’s import/export business. Mohamed 
Wahid went on to establish a company called X-trade 
for trade and contracting, followed by a marketing and 
advertising company called Green Media. Currently, 
he’s a main shareholder in both, in addition to being 
the vice-chairman of Green Towers, a real estate com-
pany with a net worth of about $16 million.
Wahid thought of the idea of establishing 
Mashaweer while he was preparing for his wedding. 
His bride-to-be was overwhelmed with errands that 
she had to get done within a few days and he started 
wondering what she would have done if she couldn’t 
afford a full-time driver who did all of her errands for 
her. While on his honeymoon, he kept thinking about 
this idea and how much time people could save and 
what a valuable service it could be. He decided to call 
his friends to start transforming the idea into an actual 
business plan. After developing the plan, the three 
entrepreneurs decided to go into the implementation 
phase and actually build this business. They started 
small and grew organically as the demand for the 
service increased. Each of the three entrepreneurs 
invested $5,000 into the project to total a starting capi-
tal of $15,000. They started with only 3 motorcycles, 6 
riders, and a hotline. 
As the three friends realized they had actually suc-
ceeded in Alexandria, they decided they wanted to 
move to the next phase by establishing Mashaweer 
in Cairo. When they decided to expand to Cairo, they 
decided to adopt a completely different strategy. 
They wanted to be able to cover all of Greater Cairo, 
as a whole, and not just specific areas, from the very 
beginning. During the Revolution in January 2011 
they started gathering market research to expand in 
Cairo and started investing heavily. Since business 
all over the country had come to a standstill, they 
made several large purchases such as motorcycles and 
advertising space for fractions of the price. When oth-
ers saw it as a time to slow down, the entrepreneurs 
saw it as an opportunity to start marketing for their 
business. By March they realized that they needed to 
increase the original investment so that they can grow 
large enough to capture the market in Cairo. To do 
so, they brought in other investors, mainly from their 
friends and family, to raise the capital investment up 
to $1.67 million. They planned to enter Cairo with full 
force so that there would be a high barrier of entry 
for any competitor. They decided that their competi-
tive advantage would have to be in investing in tech-
nology. They wanted to get an enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) system but found quotations to be 
too high. To fix this they started their own informa-
tion technology company, Innov8 (“innovate”), where 
they created a customized ERP system that they then 
connected to their customized PDAs (Personal Digital 
Assistants) through a cloud computing system made 
by LinkDotNet and Mobinil. Each rider receives tasks 
one at a time on the PDA, which also includes a GPS 
to provide detailed directions. The GPS monitors the 
rider’s location. 
  To reduce cost and ensure quality, Mashaweer 
does not rely on outsourcing in any of its stages as 
long as it can do the work with the same or better 
quality. This was why Mashaweer founded Innov8 
in order to build its system and manage its technical 
work. Now, Mashaweer only owns part of this com-
pany and is one of its numerous clients. One further 
example of Mashaweer’s in-house capabilities is its 
call center. The company preferred to have an inter-
nal call center after rejecting a number of offers for 
an outsourced one. They wanted to be able to moni-
tor the performance of the agents and always work 
on improving the quality of their customer service. 
Investing in an innovative contact center and using 
CISCO, which supports up to 300IP phones, a report-
ing module, and a recording system, made it much 
easier for Mashaweer to track its received calls and 
work on any problems that might face its customer 
service agents.
Software components developed by Innov8 include 
the Mashaweer Server, Mashaweer API (Application 
Programmers’ Interface), and Mashaweer PDA client.
The Mashaweer Server is a centralized application 
that manages the following elements:         
• 
Orders (placement, editing, pricing, review,  
 
tracking, and reports)
• 
Routes management and optimization 
68

• 
Clients (management, reports, discounts)
• 
Packages tracking
•

•

• 
Satellite offices
• 
Representatives
• 
Cash transactions and expenses tracking for  
 
representatives and satellite offices
• 
Asset tracking of vehicles, PDAs, and mobile  
 
printers
•

The API is a method of integrating Mashaweer 
ordering system with third parties. This allows third 
parties to automate their delivery system and inte-
grate Mashaweer into their existing CRM/dispatching 
systems, opening a wide opportunity for business 
expansion.
The Mashaweer PDA application is installed on 
each representative PDA and manages the following 
elements:
• 
Order items progress tracking
• 
Collection of order fees and other costs,   
 
against a printed invoice
• 
Package handling (barcode scanning and  
 
destinations)
• 
Messaging
• 
Cash and expenses tracking
• 
 Synchronizing data periodically and at the 
beginning of each shift
When Mashaweer was first introduced in Egypt, 
it captured 100 percent of market share for such a 
service, because it was the first and only company 
of its nature. However, the market was not aware or 
used to such a service, so it started growing slowly 
in Alexandria until people grasped the idea and got 
accustomed to the fact that there is a company that 
can take over your errands. In contrast, when the 
company started operating in Cairo, it grew at a sur-
prisingly fast pace. There are several factors that are 
expected to affect the target market and make it easier 
for Mashaweer to penetrate it aggressively. 
At the beginning, people’s assumption is that using 
Mashaweer is too luxurious and costly. When they use 
it for the first few times, this perception changes and 
they begin to rely on this convenient service. As more 
and more people get accustomed to the service, it 
creates a cultural change that significantly affects the 
demand on the service. 
Another factor that is expected to facilitate work-
ing conditions and reduce costs is the technological 
advances that occur every day. Mashaweer heavily 
depends on technological tools, and would benefit 
from the advancements and price reductions that 
continuously take place. As a result, Mashaweer’s total 
costs will decrease, enabling it to decrease its prices 
and further improve its quality to become even more 
convenient for a larger number of people. 
 Mashaweer is the only company of its kind in 
Egypt that operates on this scale. However, there is 
a company called Wassaly that was established in 
Cairo after Mashaweer’s success in Alexandria. This 
company operates on a much smaller scale. Their 
indirect competitors include other courier services 
(e.g. DHL, UPS, TNT, and FedEx). However, they have 
positioned themselves as the flexible courier in con-
trast to the others available in the market today; they 
offer same-day delivery rather than next-day delivery. 
Mashaweer has several other advantages that make it 
very hard for others to compete:
• A database of thousands of loyal clients.
• Manageable self-investment.
•  Highly qualified and carefully selected riders due 
to the high salaries compared to the delivery sec-
tor in the Egypt. 
• Various revenue streams. 
•  Being the owner of Innov8, which fosters technol-
ogy integration in Mashaweer.
Mashaweer has several unique selling proposi-
tions. The main two aspects are being the first in the 
market, and being the only company of its kind. The 
most important differentiator is the flexibility of their 
service, which addresses all of their customer’s needs 
and requests. 
Unlike new entrants or copycats in the market, 
Mashaweer have invested highly in the systems they 
use. They invested in PDAs to enable the operations 
process to be monitored accurately since it provides 
data like GPS tracking to track each order and the 
location or stage the messenger is located. Through 
this technology, Mashaweer decreases the amount 
of errors, as the messengers are tied to an automated 
process where they receive their tasks through the 
PDA handheld. Meanwhile, a SCADA (Supervisory 
Control and Data Acquisition) system presented on 
a big screen will be available at Mashaweer head-
quarters to monitor all live orders and measure the 
traffic in case of rush hours, thus enabling the opera-
tion team to react and try a preventive and corrective 
action.
Mashaweer’s infrastructures includes the following.
Equipment: 130 motorcycles units and 10 cars.
Software: A logistics management solution system 
was developed specifically for Mashaweer, and served 
 
Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today 
69

from a cloud-hosted server. The solution consists of a 
web-based portal where call center agents, logistics, 
and managers can add, edit, track, and view reports.
 PDA: A PDA client was developed to connect to 
the server in order to allow Mashaweer representa-
tives to view and update their assigned orders via an 
XML-based web service. Except for the PDA client, the 
solution is based on open source technologies (PHP, 
CodeIgniter, MySQL, jQuery, Ubuntu Linux). The 
PDA devices will be a main factor in integrating the 
operational team with the fleet of riders.
 Hardware: Windows Mobile PDAs were used for 
viewing and updating orders on the move. Each PDA 
is paired to a Bluetooth mobile printer for printing 
receipts. The printer is also equipped with a swipe 
card reader module so that it can be used in the future 
for credit card payment collection, and for promotion 
cards. Mashaweer server is a Linux VM hosted on a 
cloud solution provided by Innov8, the sister com-
pany that developed the entire information technol-
ogy system.
 Head Quarters: The decision was made to buy a 
new headquarters instead of renting an existing one.
Mashaweer’s future strategy is as follows:
Mashaweer Market: Mashaweer Market is an 
online supermarket that will enable people to do their 
grocery shopping through Mashaweer’s website and 
get it delivered by its representatives within 30 min-
utes of placing the order. This will be made possible 
by having access to a large number of supermarkets 
around Cairo and Alexandria, so that representatives 
can pick the order from the closest outlet and deliver 
it to the customer as quickly as possible. All products 
will be displayed on the website. 
Mashaweer is hoping to reach an average of 4000 
orders daily in return for a delivery charge of 5 
Egyptian pounds per order. 
Call center: Mashaweer’s call center is expected 
to make up an important revenue stream for the 
company in the near future, as the company starts 
introducing marketing campaigns. In addition, 
Mashaweer is planning to expand its call center to 
include other companies other than Mashaweer. 
Geographical Expansion: Using the technology 
they have invested in building their infrastructure, 
Mashaweer now has the potential to easily enter 
and penetrate other markets in different regions at 
a very low initiation cost. They plan to expand to 
other regions within Egypt, in addition to expanding 
to other countries within the Middle East. In October 
2013 they opened their first franchise in Beirut, 
Lebanon. In 2014 they opened up for business in 
Dubai, and have plans for expanding to several coun-
tries in the Gulf.

ASF is the largest chemical company in the world, generating over 
$74 billion in 2013, 3% higher than 2012.  BASF is a German company 
with headquarters in Ludwigshaven.  It has nearly 400 production 
sites around the world,  operates in 200 countries, and has just over 
100,000 employees.   As a diversified chemical company, BASF supplies chem-
icals, plastics, catalysts, industrial coatings, crop technology, and crude oil and 
gas exploration for a wide variety of industries.   The very size and scope of 
BASF’s operations provide obvious advantages  of scale, but also raise difficult 
management and organizational issues.   With existing information technolo-
gies it was difficult to create a single global BASF culture, to coordinate initia-
tives and employees across so many time zones, to collaborate in real time, 
and to allow employees to participate in decision making.
BASF managers believed one potential solution to the challenges of manag-
ing a far-flung global enterprise was to use social technology as a platform to 
solve the challenges.  Exactly how to do this, what technology to use, and how 
to implement this across the globe for its 100,000 employees was not initially 
clear.  Older stand-alone solutions such as forums, blogs, wikis,  and corporate 
Web sites provided only partial solutions.  
Instead management implemented a social business platform called con-
nect.BASF.  The platform is based on the IBM Connections enterprise social 
network platform, which operates in the IBM Cloud environment.   According 
to IDC, enterprise social network platforms provided by several firms have 
been adopted rapidly by global firms in the last few years to drive greater col-
laboration, coordination, and innovation throughout their firms.  Connect.
BASF includes many of the same functions that can be found on popular con-
SOCIAL BUSINESS AT BASF 

sumer social sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, Tumblr, cloud storage sites like 
Dropbox,  and Web-based community knowledge sites like Wikipedia, inclduing 
user profiles, status updates, news feeds, notifications, bookmarks, and file 
sharing.  The purpose is to share knowledge, collaborate, and encourage 
employees and managers to have conversations about their work. 
To implement connect.BASF, managers decided that employees should not 
be required to participate, but instead should be attracted to participate based 
on the benefits and capabilities of the platform as they perceived them.  
Implementation was carried out by two global community managers, and three 
regional community managers.  They in turn recruited advocates, the early 
adopters, who volunteer their time to spread awareness of the social network, 
and document best practices.  Users are encouraged to build communities of 
practice,  online spaces where employees with similar professional backgrounds 
can share ideas.   The implementation team used a multifaceted set of tools  
such as webinars, learning events, demonstrations, and internal consulting to 
attract employees.
In the first two years of operation, connect.BASF gathered over 33,000 users.  
The network supports more than 3,100 active work communities, and 84% of 
the users understand the business objectives of connect.BASF.  Management 
believes the enterprise social network provides faster access to company 
experts, higher employee productivity, and better flow of knowledge through-
out the firm.  Younger workers in particular are attracted to the network, and 
more comfortable with using it. The use of email and the extensive overhead in 
systems and employee distraction has been greatly reduced.  Managers have 
also had to learn new styles of management suitable to an online social envi-
ronment as opposed to relying solely on traditional face-to-face interactions 
with employees. 
The experience of BASF illustrates how much organizations today rely on 
information systems to improve their performance and remain competitive.  It 
also shows how much systems supporting collaboration and teamwork make a 
difference in an organization’s ability to innovate, execute, and grow profits.

T
he chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter.  BASF is very much a knowledge-intensive 
company, but it was hampered by the absence of an information system that 
enabled efficient global management decision making, collaboration among 
professional employees, and convenient sharing of knowledge.  This impacted 
the company’s ability to create and deliver leading-edge chemical products and 
services.  It was very difficult to manage the firm on a global basis, or to bring 
together teams located in distant time zones.  BASF  management decided that 
the best solution was to deploy recently developed social network technologies  
to move from a static corporate knowledge and work environment to one in 
which actively engaged employees and enabled them to obtain more knowl-
edge from colleagues. The company implemented IBM’s Enterprise Social 
Network platform as an enterprise-wide platform for collaboration, manage-
ment, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge transfer.  It took advantage of the

2.1 
WHAT ARE BUSINESS PROCESSES? HOW ARE 
THEY RELATED TO INFORMATION SYSTEMS?
I
n order to operate, businesses must deal with many different pieces 
of information about suppliers, customers, employees, invoices, and 
 payments, and of course their products and services. They must organize 
work activities that use this information to operate efficiently and enhance 
the overall performance of the firm. Information systems make it possible for 
firms to manage all their information, make better decisions, and improve the 
execution of their business processes.
BUSINESS PROCESSES
Business processes, which we introduced in Chapter 1, refer to the manner 
in which work is organized, coordinated, and focused to produce a  valuable 
 product or service. Business processes are the collection of activities required 
to  produce a product or service. These activities are supported by flows of 
 material,  information, and knowledge among the participants in  business 
 processes. Business processes also refer to the unique ways in which 
 organizations  coordinate work, information, and knowledge, and the ways in 
which  management chooses to coordinate work.
To a large extent, the performance of a business firm depends on how well its 
business processes are designed and coordinated. A company’s business processes 
can be a source of competitive strength if they enable the company to innovate 
or to execute better than its rivals. Business processes can also be liabilities if they 
software’s new “social” tools to increase employee collaboration and engage-
ment. BASF now relies on its internal enterprise social network for much of 
employee learning and problem solving.
Much more than technology was involved in the transformation of BASF’s 
work culture.  BASF managers developed a management philosophy of volun-
tary participation in the network.   It created an implementation team at the 
top and middle of the form, and slowly spread the word to corporate entities 
around the globe through webinars, learning events, and internal consulting.   
Here are some questions to think about: How are collaboration and employee 
engagement keeping BASF competitive? How did using a single enterprise 
social network platform change the way work was performed at BASF?
 
Chapter 2 Global E-business and Collaboration

are based on outdated ways of working that impede organizational responsive-
ness and efficiency. The chapter-opening case describing BASF’s improvements 
in knowledge-sharing processes clearly illustrates these points, as do many of the 
other cases in this text.
Every business can be seen as a collection of business processes, some 
of which are part of larger encompassing processes. For instance, uses 
of  mentoring, wikis, blogs, and videos are all part of the overall  knowledge 
 management  process. Many business processes are tied to a specific  functional 
area. For example, the sales and marketing function is responsible for 
 identifying  customers, and the human resources function is responsible for 
hiring  employees. Table 2.1 describes some typical business processes for each 
of the functional areas of business.
Other business processes cross many different functional areas and require 
coordination across departments. For instance, consider the seemingly simple 
 FIGURE 2.1

business process of fulfilling a customer order (see Figure 2.1). Initially, the sales 
department receives a sales order. The order passes first to accounting to ensure 
the customer can pay for the order either by a credit verification or request for 
immediate payment prior to shipping. Once the customer credit is established, 
the production department pulls the product from inventory or produces the 
product. Then the product is shipped (and this may require  working with a 
 logistics firm, such as UPS or FedEx). A bill or invoice is  generated by the account-
ing department, and a notice is sent to the customer indicating that the product 
has shipped. The sales department is notified of the shipment and prepares to 
support the customer by answering calls or fulfilling warranty claims.
What at first appears to be a simple process, fulfilling an order, turns out to 
be a very complicated series of business processes that require the close coor-
dination of major functional groups in a firm. Moreover, to efficiently perform 
all these steps in the order fulfillment process requires a great deal of informa-
tion. The required information must flow rapidly both within the firm from one 
 decision maker to another; with business partners, such as delivery firms; and 
with the customer. Computer-based information systems make this possible.
HOW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES 
BUSINESS PROCESSES
Exactly how do information systems improve business processes? Information 
systems automate many steps in business processes that were formerly 
 performed manually, such as checking a client’s credit, or generating an invoice 
and shipping order. But today, information technology can do much more. New 
technology can actually change the flow of information, making it possible for 
many more people to access and share information, replacing sequential steps 
with tasks that can be performed simultaneously, and eliminating delays in deci-
sion making. New information technology frequently changes the way a business 
works and supports entirely new business models. Downloading a Kindle e-book 
from Amazon, buying a computer online at Best Buy, and downloading a music 
track from iTunes are entirely new business processes based on new business 
models that would be inconceivable without today’s information technology.
That’s why it’s so important to pay close attention to business processes, both 
in your information systems course and in your future career. By  analyzing 
 business processes, you can achieve a very clear understanding of how a 
 business actually works. Moreover, by conducting a business process  analysis, 
you will also begin to understand how to change the business by improving 
its  processes to make it more efficient or effective. Throughout this book, we 
examine business processes with a view to understanding how they might 
be improved by using information technology to achieve greater efficiency, 
 innovation, and customer service.
2.2  
HOW DO SYSTEMS SERVE THE DIFFERENT 
MANAGEMENT GROUPS IN A BUSINESS AND HOW 
DO SYSTEMS THAT LINK THE ENTERPRISE 
IMPROVE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE?
Now that you understand business processes, it is time to look more closely 
at how information systems support the business processes of a firm. Because 
there are different interests, specialties, and levels in an organization, there are 
 
Chapter 2 Global E-business and Collaboration 
77

different kinds of systems. No single system can provide all the information an 
organization needs.
A typical business organization has systems supporting processes for each of 
the major business functions—sales and marketing, manufacturing and produc-
tion, finance and accounting, and human resources. You can find examples of 
systems for each of these business functions in the Learning Tracks for this 
chapter. Functional systems that operate independently of each other are 
becoming a thing of the past because they cannot easily share information to 
support cross-functional business processes. Many have been replaced with 
large-scale cross-functional systems that integrate the activities of related 
 business processes and organizational units. We describe these integrated 
 cross-functional applications later in this section.
A typical firm also has different systems supporting the decision-making 
needs of each of the main management groups we described in Chapter 1. 
Operational management, middle management, and senior management each 
use systems to support the decisions they must make to run the company. Let’s 
look at these systems and the types of decisions they support.
SYSTEMS FOR DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT GROUPS 
A business firm has systems to support different groups or levels of  management. 
These systems include transaction processing systems and systems for  business 
intelligence.
Transaction Processing Systems
Operational managers need systems that keep track of the elementary  activities 
and transactions of the organization, such as sales, receipts, cash deposits, 
 payroll, credit decisions, and the flow of materials in a factory. Transaction 
processing systems (TPS) provide this kind of information. A transaction 
 processing system is a computerized system that performs and records the 
daily routine transactions necessary to conduct business, such as sales order 
entry, hotel reservations, payroll, employee record keeping, and shipping.
The principal purpose of systems at this level is to answer routine questions 
and to track the flow of transactions through the organization. How many parts 
are in inventory? What happened to Mr. Smith’s payment? To answer these 
kinds of questions, information generally must be easily available, current, and 
accurate.
At the operational level, tasks, resources, and goals are predefined and highly 
structured. The decision to grant credit to a customer, for instance, is made by 
a lower-level supervisor according to predefined criteria. All that must be 
 determined is whether the customer meets the criteria.
Figure 2.2 illustrates a TPS for payroll processing. A payroll system keeps 
track of money paid to employees. An employee time sheet with the employ-
ee’s name, social security number, and number of hours worked per week 
 represents a single transaction for this system. Once this transaction is input 
into the system, it updates the system’s master file (or database—see Chapter 6) 
that permanently maintains employee information for the organization. The 
data in the system are combined in different ways to create reports of interest 
to management and government agencies and to send paychecks to employees.
Managers need TPS to monitor the status of internal operations and the firm’s 
relations with the external environment. TPS are also major producers of infor-
mation for the other systems and business functions. For example, the payroll 
system illustrated in Figure 2.2, along with other accounting TPS,  supplies data to 
78 
Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

the company’s general ledger system, which is responsible for maintaining 
records of the firm’s income and expenses and for producing reports such as 
income statements and balance sheets. It also supplies employee payment his-
tory data for insurance, pension, and other benefits calculations to the firm’s 
human resources function, and employee payment data to government agencies 
such as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration.
Transaction processing systems are often so central to a business that TPS 
failure for a few hours can lead to a firm’s demise and perhaps that of other 
firms linked to it. Imagine what would happen to UPS if its package tracking 
system was not working! What would the airlines do without their computer-
ized reservation systems?
Systems for Business Intelligence
Firms also have business intelligence systems that focus on delivering 
 information to support management decision making. Business intelligence 
is a  contemporary term for data and software tools for organizing, analyzing, 
and providing access to data to help managers and other enterprise users make 
more informed decisions. Business intelligence addresses the decision-making 
needs of all levels of management. This section provides a brief introduction to 
business intelligence. You’ll learn more about this topic in Chapters 6 and 12.
Business intelligence systems for middle management help with monitor-
ing, controlling, decision-making, and administrative activities. In Chapter 
1, we defined management information systems as the study of information 
 systems in business and management. The term management information

 FIGURE 2.3 
HOW MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS OBTAIN THEIR DATA FROM 
THE ORGANIZATION’S TPS 
In the system illustrated by this diagram, three TPS supply summarized transaction data to the MIS reporting system 
at the end of the time period. Managers gain access to the organizational data through the MIS, which provides them 
with the appropriate reports.
 systems (MIS) also designates a specific category of information systems 
 serving middle management. MIS provide middle managers with reports on the 
 organization’s current performance. This information is used to monitor and 
control the  business and predict future performance.
MIS summarize and report on the company’s basic operations using data 
 supplied by transaction processing systems. The basic transaction data from TPS 
are compressed and usually presented in reports that are produced on a regular 
schedule. Today, many of these reports are delivered online. Figure 2.3 shows 
how a typical MIS transforms transaction-level data from inventory,  production, 
and accounting into MIS files that are used to provide managers with reports. 
Figure 2.4 shows a sample report from this system.
MIS typically provide answers to routine questions that have been specified 
in advance and have a predefined procedure for answering them. For instance, 
MIS reports might list the total pounds of lettuce used this quarter by a  fast-food 
chain or, as illustrated in Figure 2.4, compare total annual sales figures for 
 specific products to planned targets. These systems generally are not flexible 
and have little analytical capability. Most MIS use simple routines, such as 
 summaries and comparisons, as opposed to sophisticated mathematical models 
or statistical techniques.
Other types of business intelligence systems support more non-routine 
 decision making. Decision-support systems (DSS) focus on problems that 
are unique and rapidly changing, for which the procedure for arriving at a 
 solution may not be fully predefined in advance. They try to answer questions 
such as these: What would be the impact on production schedules if we were to 
double sales in the month of December? What would happen to our return on 
investment if a factory schedule were delayed for six months?
Although DSS use internal information from TPS and MIS, they often bring 
in information from external sources, such as current stock prices or product 
80 
Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

prices of competitors. These systems are employed by “super-user” managers 
and business analysts who want to use sophisticated analytics and models to 
analyze data.
An interesting, small, but powerful DSS is the voyage-estimating system of 
a large global shipping company that transports bulk cargoes of coal, oil, ores, 
and finished products. The firm owns some vessels, charters others, and bids 
for shipping contracts in the open market to carry general cargo. A voyage- 
estimating system calculates financial and technical voyage details. Financial 
calculations include ship/time costs (fuel, labor, capital), freight rates for 
 various types of cargo, and port expenses. Technical details include a myriad 
of factors, such as ship cargo capacity, speed, port distances, fuel and water 
 consumption, and loading patterns (location of cargo for different ports). 
The system can answer questions such as the following: Given a customer 
delivery schedule and an offered freight rate, which vessel should be assigned 
at what rate to maximize profits? What is the optimal speed at which a particu-
lar vessel can optimize its profit and still meet its delivery schedule? What is the 
optimal loading pattern for a ship bound for the U.S. West Coast from Malaysia? 
Figure 2.5 illustrates the DSS built for this company. The system operates on a 
powerful desktop personal computer, providing a system of menus that makes 
it easy for users to enter data or obtain information.
The voyage-estimating DSS we have just described draws heavily on models. 
Other business intelligence systems are more data-driven, focusing instead on 
extracting useful information from massive quantities of data. For example, 
large ski resort companies such as Intrawest and Vail Resorts collect and store 
large amounts of customer data from call centers, lodging and dining reserva-
tions, ski schools, and ski equipment rental stores. They use special software 
to analyze these data to determine the value, revenue potential, and loyalty 
of each customer to help managers make better decisions about how to target 
their marketing programs.

Conceptually, baggage handling is quite simple. 
Baggage input is connected to merely two events: 
an airplane lands or a person checks in. However, 
it’s risky business. Baggage handling is one of the 
most important factors in having a pleasant trip. 
Moreover, mishandled baggage is a US$ 2.5 billion 
problem for industry every year. This problem may 
annually affect about 51 million passengers travel-
ing through Schiphol alone.
 In 2004, IBM Corporation, Vanderlande 
Industries, and later Grenzebach Automation 
Systems jointly took up the challenge of renew-
ing the Baggage Control System for one of the big-
gest airport hubs in Europe, and one of the busiest 
in the world: Schiphol International Airport, in 
Amsterdam, The Netherlands. With an investment 
of around US$1 billion over a period of about 10 
years, Schiphol’s goal was threefold: (a) realize a 
monumental 1% maximum loss of transfer-bags 
(against the initial 22 million lost baggage); (b) 
increase capacity from 40 to 70 million bags; (c) 
reduce cost per bag without increasing wait-times.
Most of the job involved Schiphol’s gigantic bag-
gage conveyors network: 21 kilometers of transport 
tracks, 6 robotic units, 9,000 storage capacitors all 
behaving as one system. Also, extending it with 
more surfaces is not possible, given the land condi-
tions surrounding the airport. The Schiphol bag-
gage conveyors networks have a very simple goal: 
the right bag must be at the right place at the right 
time. To pursue this goal the network must perform 
several key roles: move bags from the check-in 
area to the departure gate, move bags from gate to 
gate, move bags from the arrival gate to the baggage 
claim, and plan and control peripheral hardware 
and software. In addition, these roles involve a wide 
variety of sensors, actuators, mechanical devices, 
and computers. The network uses over 3 million 
lines of source code. Some of the advanced technol-
ogy used in baggage-handling systems includes des-
tination-coded vehicles (DCVs), automatic bar code 
scanners, radio-frequency identification (RFID) 
tags, and high-tech conveyors equipped with sorting 
machines. In addition, all of this must be available 
and robust; that is, operate 99.99% of times while 
being able to minimize loss or damage in that 0.01% 
of the time it doesn’t.
The following simple scenario summarizes the 
operations of the Schiphol baggage conveyors net-
work. You arrive at check-in desk, and your bags 
are tagged. The tags contain your flight information 
and a bar-code/RFID that all of the computers in 
the baggage-handling system can read. When com-
puters in the system scan the bar code or detect 
the RFID, they process the information it contains 
and determine where to send your bag. After being 
scanned (at least) once, the system always knows 
where your bag is at any point, and is able to redi-
rect it based on three parameters: (a) time of its 
flight; (b) priority; (c) size. Bags for immediate 
embarkation are considered “hot.” These are sent 
immediately to aircraft stands while “cold” baggage 
(i.e. low priority, distant flight time) are quickly 
rerouted away from the main “highway” tracks, 
directed towards various storage points in the net-
work. DCVs are unmanned carts that can load and 
unload bags without stopping movement. These 
carts move on tracks like miniature roller coast-
ers along the main “highway” tracks that span the 
airport. Buffers and hot/cold storage areas are used 
to avoid overcrowding. Computers throughout the 
system keep track of the location of each bag, its 
destination, and the time it is needed at that desti-
nation. The system can optimize the routes taken 
by the carts to get the bags needed most urgently 
to their destinations fastest. Because DCVs move at 
high speed and do not come to a full stop to receive 
baggage, the conveyors must be extremely precise, 
depositing bags where they are needed at just the 
right time for maximum efficiency. Once bags reach 
the gate, they enter a sorting station where airline 
employees use computer terminals to send bags to 
the correct plane. To make even surer that baggage 
is not lost, the system “reconciles” baggage with its 
owner; it checks if the baggage and the owner are 
actually on the same plane.
However beautiful and harmonious this process 
may seem, there are still many things that can go 
wrong. For example, what if baggage is mis-tagged? 
What if the tag is unreadable? What about sched-
ule changes? Although baggage handling is a com-
plex process and baggage handling systems can be 
extremely expensive, if implemented successfully, 
they pay for themselves. Imagine saving around 
0.1% of 2.5 billion. It’s a lot of money!
The new baggage system at Schiphol is not flaw-
less. In November 2012, a special warrant by local 
police was issued that required stopping the tracks

lems solved by Schiphol’s information systems and how the systems improve 
business  operations and decision making.
Business intelligence systems also address the decision-making needs of 
senior management. Senior managers need systems that focus on strategic 
issues and long-term trends, both in the firm and in the external environment. 
They are concerned with questions such as: What will employment levels be in 
five years? What are the long-term industry cost trends? What products should 
we be making in five years?

Executive support systems (ESS) help senior management make these 
decisions. They address non-routine decisions requiring judgment, evaluation, 
and insight because there is no agreed-on procedure for arriving at a solution. 
ESS present graphs and data from many sources through an interface that is 
easy for senior managers to use. Often the information is delivered to senior 
executives through a portal, which uses a Web interface to present integrated 
personalized business content. 
ESS are designed to incorporate data about external events, such as new tax 
laws or competitors, but they also draw summarized information from internal 
MIS and DSS. They filter, compress, and track critical data, displaying the data 
of greatest importance to senior managers. Increasingly, such systems include 
business intelligence analytics for analyzing trends, forecasting, and “drilling 
down” to data at greater levels of detail. 
For example, the CEO of Leiner Health Products, the largest manufacturer 
of private-label vitamins and supplements in the United States, has an ESS 
that provides on his desktop a minute-to-minute view of the firm’s financial 
 performance as measured by working capital, accounts receivable, accounts 
payable, cash flow, and inventory. The information is presented in the form of 
a digital dashboard, which displays on a single screen graphs and charts of 
key performance indicators for managing a company. Digital dashboards are 
becoming an increasingly popular tool for management decision makers.
Contemporary business intelligence and analytics technology have 
 promoted data-driven management, where decision makers rely heavily on 
analytical tools and data at their fingertips to guide their work. Data captured 
at the factory or sales floor level are immediately available for high-level 
or detailed views in executive dashboards and reports. It's real-time 
 management. 
A digital dashboard delivers 
comprehensive and accurate 
information for decision 
making often using a single 
screen. The graphical over-
view of key performance 
indicators helps managers 
quickly spot areas that need 
attention.

SYSTEMS FOR LINKING THE ENTERPRISE
Reviewing all the different types of systems we have just described, you might 
wonder how a business can manage all the information in these different 
 systems. You might also wonder how costly it is to maintain so many  different 
systems. And you might wonder how all these different systems can share 
 information and how managers and employees are able to coordinate their 
work. In fact, these are all important questions for businesses today.
Enterprise Applications
Getting all the different kinds of systems in a company to work together has 
proven a major challenge. Typically, corporations are put together both through 
normal “organic” growth and through acquisition of smaller firms. Over a 
period of time, corporations end up with a collection of systems, most of them 
older, and face the challenge of getting them all to “talk” with one another 
and work together as one corporate system. There are several  solutions to this 
problem.
One solution is to implement enterprise applications, which are systems 
that span functional areas, focus on executing business processes across the 
business firm, and include all levels of management. Enterprise applications 
help businesses become more flexible and productive by coordinating their 
business processes more closely and integrating groups of processes so they 
focus on efficient management of resources and customer service.
There are four major enterprise applications: enterprise systems, supply 
chain management systems, customer relationship management systems, 
and knowledge management systems. Each of these enterprise applica-
tions  integrates a related set of functions and business processes to enhance 
the  performance of the organization as a whole. Figure 2.6 shows that the 
 architecture for these enterprise applications encompasses processes  spanning 
the entire organization and, in some cases, extending beyond the organization 
to customers, suppliers, and other key business partners.
Enterprise Systems Firms use enterprise systems, also known as 
 enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, to integrate business processes 
in manufacturing and production, finance and accounting, sales and 
 marketing, and human resources into a single software system. Information 
that was previously fragmented in many different systems is stored in a single 
comprehensive data repository where it can be used by many different parts 
of the business.
For example, when a customer places an order, the order data flow 
 automatically to other parts of the company that are affected by them. The 
order transaction triggers the warehouse to pick the ordered products and 
schedule shipment. The warehouse informs the factory to replenish what-
ever has been depleted. The accounting department is notified to send the 
 customer an invoice. Customer service representatives track the progress of the 
order through every step to inform customers about the status of their orders. 
Managers are able to use firmwide information to make more precise and 
timely decisions about daily operations and longer-term planning.
Supply Chain Management Systems Firms use supply chain  management 
(SCM) systems to help manage relationships with their suppliers. These 
 systems help suppliers, purchasing firms, distributors, and logistics companies 
share information about orders, production, inventory levels, and delivery of 
products and services so they can source, produce, and deliver goods and 
 services efficiently. The ultimate objective is to get the right amount of their 
 
Chapter 2 Global E-business and Collaboration 
85

products from their source to their point of consumption in the least amount of 
time and at the lowest cost. These systems increase firm profitability by 
 lowering the costs of moving and making products and by enabling managers to 
make better decisions about how to organize and schedule sourcing, produc-
tion, and distribution.
Supply chain management systems are one type of interorganizational 
system because they automate the flow of information across organizational 
boundaries. You will find examples of other types of interorganizational 
 information systems throughout this text because such systems make it  possible 
for firms to link electronically to customers and to outsource their work to other 
companies.
Customer Relationship Management Systems Firms use customer 
 relationship management (CRM) systems to help manage their relation-
ships with their customers. CRM systems provide information to coordinate all 
of the business processes that deal with customers in sales, marketing, and 
 service to optimize revenue, customer satisfaction, and customer retention. 
This information helps firms identify, attract, and retain the most profitable 
customers; provide better service to existing customers; and increase sales.
Knowledge Management Systems Some firms perform better than others 
because they have better knowledge about how to create, produce, and deliver 
products and services. This firm knowledge is unique, difficult to imitate, and 
can be leveraged into long-term strategic benefits. Knowledge management 
systems (KMS) enable organizations to better manage  processes for capturing 
 FIGURE 2.6 
 ENTERPRISE APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE
Enterprise applications automate processes that span multiple business functions and organizational 
levels and may extend outside the organization.
86 
Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

and applying knowledge and expertise. These systems collect all relevant 
knowledge and experience in the firm, and make it available wherever and 
whenever it is needed to improve business processes and management 
 decisions. They also link the firm to external sources of knowledge.
We examine enterprise systems and systems for supply chain management 
and customer relationship management in greater detail in Chapter 9. We discuss 
collaboration systems that support knowledge management in this chapter and 
cover other types of knowledge management applications in Chapter 11.
Intranets and Extranets
Enterprise applications create deep-seated changes in the way the firm  conducts 
its business, offering many opportunities to integrate important  business 
data into a single system. They are often costly and difficult to implement. 
Intranets and extranets deserve mention here as alternative tools for increasing 
 integration and expediting the flow of information within the firm, and with 
customers and suppliers. 
Intranets are simply internal company Web sites that are accessible only by 
employees. The term “intranet” refers to an internal network, in contrast to the 
Internet, which is a public network linking organizations and other external 
networks. Intranets use the same technologies and techniques as the larger 
Internet, and they often are simply a private access area in a larger company 
Web site. Likewise with extranets. Extranets are company Web sites that are 
accessible to authorized vendors and suppliers, and are often used to  coordinate 
the movement of supplies to the firm’s production apparatus. 
For example, Six Flags, which operates 19 theme parks throughout North 
America, maintains an intranet for its 2,500 full-time employees that provides 
company-related news and information on each park’s day-to-day operations, 
including weather forecasts, performance schedules, and details about groups 
and celebrities visiting the parks. The company also uses an extranet to 
 broadcast information about schedule changes and park events to its 30,000 
seasonal employees. We describe the technology for intranets and extranets in 
more detail in Chapter 7.
E-BUSINESS, E-COMMERCE, AND E-GOVERNMENT
The systems and technologies we have just described are transforming firms’ 
relationships with customers, employees, suppliers, and logistic partners into 
digital relationships using networks and the Internet. So much business is now 
enabled by or based upon digital networks that we use the terms “electronic 
business” and “electronic commerce” frequently throughout this text.
Electronic business, or e-business, refers to the use of digital technology 
and the Internet to execute the major business processes in the enterprise. 
E-business includes activities for the internal management of the firm and 
for coordination with suppliers and other business partners. It also includes 
 electronic commerce, or e-commerce.
E-commerce is the part of e-business that deals with the buying and selling of 
goods and services over the Internet. It also encompasses activities supporting 
those market transactions, such as advertising, marketing, customer support, 
security, delivery, and payment. 
The technologies associated with e-business have also brought about similar 
changes in the public sector. Governments on all levels are using Internet tech-
nology to deliver information and services to citizens, employees, and businesses 
with which they work. E-government refers to the application of the Internet 
 
Chapter 2 Global E-business and Collaboration 
87

and networking technologies to digitally enable government and public sector 
agencies’ relationships with citizens, businesses, and other arms of government. 
In addition to improving delivery of government services, e-government 
makes government operations more efficient and also empowers citizens by 
giving them easier access to information and the ability to network electroni-
cally with other citizens. For example, citizens in some states can renew their 
driver’s licenses or apply for unemployment benefits online, and the Internet 
has become a powerful tool for instantly mobilizing interest groups for political 
action and fund-raising.
2.3  
WHY ARE SYSTEMS FOR COLLABORATION AND 
SOCIAL BUSINESS SO IMPORTANT AND WHAT 
TECHNOLOGIES DO THEY USE?
With all these systems and information, you might wonder how is it possible to 
make sense of them? How do people working in firms pull it all together, work 
towards common goals, and coordinate plans and actions? Information  systems 
can’t make decisions, hire or fire people, sign contracts, agree on deals, or 
adjust the price of goods to the marketplace. In addition to the types of  systems 
we have just described, businesses need special systems to support collabora-
tion and teamwork.
WHAT IS COLLABORATION?
Collaboration is working with others to achieve shared and explicit goals. 
Collaboration focuses on task or mission accomplishment and usually takes 
place in a business, or other organization, and between businesses. You 
 collaborate with a colleague in Tokyo having expertise on a topic about which 
you know nothing. You collaborate with many colleagues in publishing a 
company blog. If you’re in a law firm, you collaborate with accountants in an 
accounting firm in servicing the needs of a client with tax problems. 
Collaboration can be short-lived, lasting a few minutes, or longer term, 
depending on the nature of the task and the relationship among participants. 
Collaboration can be one-to-one or many-to-many. 
Employees may collaborate in informal groups that are not a formal part 
of the business firm’s organizational structure or they may be organized into 
formal teams. Teams have a specific mission that someone in the business 
assigned to them. Team members need to collaborate on the accomplishment 
of specific tasks and collectively achieve the team mission. The team mission 
might be to “win the game,” or “increase online sales by 10 percent.” Teams are 
often short-lived, depending on the problems they tackle and the length of time 
needed to find a solution and accomplish the mission.
Collaboration and teamwork are more important today than ever for a  variety 
of reasons.
• Changing nature of work. The nature of work has changed from factory 
 manufacturing and pre-computer office work where each stage in the 
 production process occurred independently of one another, and was 
 coordinated by supervisors. Work was organized into silos. Within a silo, 
work passed from one machine tool station to another, from one desktop to 
another, until the finished product was completed. Today, jobs require much 
88 
Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

closer coordination and interaction among the  parties involved in producing 
the service or product. A recent report from the consulting firm McKinsey & 
Company argued that 41 percent of the U.S. labor force is now composed of 
jobs where interaction (talking, e-mailing, presenting, and persuading) is the 
primary value-adding activity. Even in factories, workers today often work in 
production groups, or pods.
• Growth of professional work. “Interaction” jobs tend to be professional 
jobs in the service sector that require close coordination and collabora-
tion. Professional jobs require substantial education, and the sharing of 
 information and opinions to get work done. Each actor on the job brings 
 specialized expertise to the problem, and all the actors need to take one 
another into account in order to accomplish the job.
• Changing organization of the firm. For most of the industrial age, managers 
organized work in a hierarchical fashion. Orders came down the hierarchy, 
and responses moved back up the hierarchy. Today, work is organized into 
groups and teams, and the members are expected to develop their own 
methods for accomplishing the task. Senior managers observe and  measure 
results, but are much less likely to issue detailed orders or  operating 
 procedures. In part, this is because expertise and decision-making power 
have been pushed down in organizations.
• Changing scope of the firm. The work of the firm has changed from a single 
 location to multiple locations—offices or factories throughout a region, a 
nation, or even around the globe. For instance, Henry Ford developed the first 
 mass-production automobile plant at a single Dearborn, Michigan factory. 
In 2014, Ford employed 180,000 people at around 965 plants and facilities 
 worldwide. With this kind of global presence, the need for close coordination 
of design, production, marketing, distribution, and service obviously takes 
on new importance and scale. Large global companies need to have teams 
 working on a global basis.
• Emphasis on innovation. Although we tend to attribute innovations in 
 business and science to great individuals, these great individuals are most 
likely working with a team of brilliant colleagues. Think of Bill Gates and 
Steve Jobs (founders of Microsoft and Apple), both of whom are highly 
regarded innovators, and both of whom built strong collaborative teams 
to nurture and support innovation in their firms. Their initial innovations 
derived from close collaboration with colleagues and partners. Innovation, in 
other words, is a group and social process, and most innovations derive from 
collaboration among individuals in a lab, a business, or government agencies. 
Strong collaborative practices and technologies are believed to increase the 
rate and quality of innovation.
• Changing culture of work and business. Most research on collaboration 
 supports the notion that diverse teams produce better outputs, faster, 
than individuals working on their own. Popular notions of the crowd 
 (“crowdsourcing,” and the “wisdom of crowds”) also provide cultural support 
for collaboration and teamwork.
WHAT IS SOCIAL BUSINESS?
Many firms today enhance collaboration by embracing social business—the 
use of social networking platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and  internal 
corporate social tools—to engage their employees, customers, and suppliers. 
These tools enable workers to set up profiles, form groups, and “follow” each 
other’s status updates. The goal of social business is to deepen interactions 
with groups inside and outside the firm to expedite and enhance information- 
sharing, innovation, and decision making.
 
Chapter 2 Global E-business and Collaboration 
89

A key word in social business is “conversations.” Customers,  suppliers, 
employees, managers, and even oversight agencies continually have 
 conversations about firms, often without the knowledge of the firm or its key 
actors (employees and managers). 
Supporters of social business argue that, if firms could tune into these 
 conversations, they would strengthen their bonds with consumers, suppliers, 
and employees, increasing their emotional involvement in the firm.
All of this requires a great deal of information transparency. People need to 
share opinions and facts with others quite directly, without intervention from 
executives or others. Employees get to know directly what customers and other 
employees think; suppliers will learn very directly the opinions of supply chain 
partners; and even managers presumably will learn more directly from their 
employees how well they are doing. Nearly everyone involved in the creation 
of value will know much more about everyone else.
If such an environment could be created, it is likely to drive operational 
 efficiencies, spur innovation, and accelerate decision making. If  product 
 designers can learn directly about how their products are doing in the market in 
 real time, based on consumer feedback, they can speed up the  redesign  process. 
If employees can use social connections inside and outside the  company to 
 capture new knowledge and insights, they will be able to work more efficiently 
and solve more business problems.
Table 2.2 describes important applications of social business inside and 
 outside the firm. This chapter focuses on enterprise social business—its  internal 
corporate uses. Chapters 7 and 10 describe social business applications relating 
to customers and suppliers outside the company.
BUSINESS BENEFITS OF COLLABORATION AND SOCIAL 
BUSINESS
Although many articles and books have been written about collaboration, 
nearly all of the research on this topic is anecdotal. Nevertheless, there is a 
general belief among both business and academic communities that the 
more a  business firm is “collaborative,” the more successful it will be, and 
that collaboration within and among firms is more essential than in the

past. A recent global survey of business and information systems managers 
found that  investments in  collaboration technology produced organizational 
improvements that returned over four times the amount of the investment, 
with the greatest  benefits for sales, marketing, and research and development 
 functions (Frost and White, 2009). Another study of the value of collaboration 
also found that the  overall economic benefit of  collaboration was significant: 
for every word seen by an employee in e-mails from others, $70 of additional 
 revenue was generated (Aral, Brynjolfsson, and Van Alstyne, 2007). McKinsey 
& Company consultants predict that social  technologies used within and across 
enterprises could potentially raise the  productivity of interaction workers by 20 
to 25  percent (McKinsey, 2012). 
Table 2.3 summarizes some of the benefits of collaboration and social  business 
that have been identified. Figure 2.7 graphically illustrates how  collaboration is 
believed to impact business performance.
BUILDING A COLLABORATIVE CULTURE AND BUSINESS 
PROCESSES
Collaboration won’t take place spontaneously in a business firm, especially if 
there is no supportive culture or business processes. Business firms,  especially 
large firms, had a reputation in the past for being “command and control” 
 organizations where the top leaders thought up all the really important  matters, 
and then ordered lower-level employees to execute senior management plans. 
The job of middle management supposedly was to pass messages back and 
forth, up and down the hierarchy.
Command and control firms required lower-level employees to carry out 
orders without asking too many questions, with no responsibility to improve 
 processes, and with no rewards for teamwork or team performance. If your 
work group needed help from another work group, that was something for the 
bosses to figure out. You never communicated horizontally, always  vertically, 
so  management could control the process. Together, the expectations of

Productivity
People interacting and working together can capture expert knowledge and 
solve problems more rapidly than the same number of people working in 
isolation from one another. There will be fewer errors.
Quality
People working collaboratively can communicate errors, and corrective 
actions faster than if they work in isolation. Collaborative and take social 
technologies help reduce time delays in design and production.
Innovation
People working collaboratively can come up with more innovative ideas for 
products, services, and administration than the same number working in 
isolation from one another. Advantages to diversity and the “wisdom of 
crowds.”
Customer service
People working together using collaboration and social tools can solve 
customer complaints and issues faster and more effectively than if they 
were working in isolation from one another. 
Financial performance

sales growth)
As a result of all of the above, collaborative firms have superior sales, sales 
growth, and financial performance.
 
Chapter 2 Global E-business and Collaboration 
91

management and employees formed a culture, a set of assumptions about 
common goals and how people should behave. Many business firms still  operate 
this way.
A collaborative business culture and business processes are very different. 
Senior managers are responsible for achieving results, but rely on teams of 
employees to achieve and implement the results. Policies, products, designs, 
processes, and systems are much more dependent on teams at all levels of 
the organization to devise, to create, and to build. Teams are rewarded for 
their  performance, and individuals are rewarded for their performance in 
a team. The function of middle managers is to build the teams, coordinate 
their work, and monitor their performance. The business culture and busi-
ness  processes are more “social.” In a collaborative culture, senior manage-
ment establishes  collaboration and teamwork as vital to the organization, and 
it actually  implements collaboration for the senior ranks of the business as 
well.
TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR COLLABORATION AND 
SOCIAL BUSINESS
A collaborative, team-oriented culture won’t produce benefits without informa-
tion systems in place to enable collaboration and social business. Currently 
there are hundreds of tools designed to deal with the fact that, in order to 
succeed in our jobs, we are all much more dependent on one another, our 
fellow employees, customers, suppliers and managers. Some of these tools are 
 expensive, but others are available online for free (or with premium versions 
for a modest fee). Let’s look more closely at some of these tools.
 FIGURE 2.7 
REQUIREMENTS FOR COLLABORATION
Successful collaboration requires an appropriate organizational structure and culture, along with 
appropriate collaboration technology.
92 
Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

E-mail and Instant Messaging (IM)
E-mail and instant messaging (including text messaging) have been major 
communication and collaboration tools for interaction jobs. Their software 
operates on computers, cell phones, and other wireless devices and includes 
features for sharing files as well as transmitting messages. Many instant mes-
saging systems allow users to engage in real-time conversations with multiple 
participants simultaneously. In recent years, e-mail use has declined, with 
messaging and social media becoming preferred channels of communication. 
Wikis
Wikis are a type of Web site that makes it easy for users to contribute and edit 
text content and graphics without any knowledge of Web page development or 
programming techniques. The most well-known wiki is Wikipedia, the largest 
collaboratively edited reference project in the world. It relies on volunteers, 
makes no money and accepts no advertising. 
Wikis are very useful tools for storing and sharing corporate knowledge and 
insights. Enterprise software vendor SAP AG has a wiki that acts as a base of 
information for people outside the company, such as customers and software 
developers who build programs that interact with SAP software. In the past, 
those people asked and sometimes answered questions in an informal way on 
SAP online forums, but that was an inefficient system, with people asking and 
answering the same questions over and over.
Virtual Worlds
Virtual worlds, such as Second Life, are online 3-D environments populated 
by “residents” who have built graphical representations of themselves known 
as avatars. Companies like IBM, Cisco, and Intel Corporations use the online 
world for meetings, interviews, guest speaker events, and employee training. 
Real-world people represented by avatars meet, interact, and exchange ideas 
at these virtual locations using gestures, chat box conversations, and voice 
communication. 
Collaboration and Social Business Platforms
There are now suites of software products providing multi-function platforms 
for collaboration and social business among teams of employees who work 
together from many different locations. The most widely used are Internet-
based audio conferencing and video conferencing systems, cloud collaboration 
services such as Google’s online tools and cyberlockers, corporate collaboration 
systems such as Microsoft SharePoint, and enterprise social networking tools 
such as Salesforce Chatter, Microsoft’s Yammer, Jive, and IBM Connections.
Virtual Meeting Systems In an effort to reduce travel expenses, many 
 companies, both large and small, are adopting videoconferencing and Web 
 conferencing technologies. Companies such as Heinz, General Electric, and 
Pepsico are using virtual meeting systems for product briefings, training 
courses, strategy sessions, and even inspirational chats.
A videoconference allows individuals at two or more locations to com-
municate simultaneously through two-way video and audio transmissions. 
High-end videoconferencing systems feature telepresence technology, an 
integrated audio and visual environment which allows a person to give the 
appearance of being present at a location other than his or her true physical 
location. Free or low-cost Internet-based systems such as Skype group video-
conferencing, Google+ Hangouts, Zoom, and ooVoo are of lower quality, but 
 
Chapter 2 Global E-business and Collaboration 
93

still useful for smaller companies. Apple’s FaceTime is useful for one-to-one 
videoconferencing. 
Companies of all sizes are finding Web-based online meeting tools such 
as Cisco WebEx, Microsoft Lync, and Adobe Connect especially helpful for 
 training and sales presentations. These products enable participants to share 
documents and presentations in conjunction with audioconferencing and live 
video via Webcam. 
Cloud Collaboration Services: Google Tools and Cyberlockers Google 
offers many online tools and services, and some are suitable for collaboration. 
They include Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Apps, Google Sites, and Google 
+. Most are free of charge. 
Google Drive is a file storage and synchronization service for cloud 
 storage, file sharing and collaborative editing. Google Drive is an example of 
a  cloud-based cyberlocker. Cyberlockers are online file-sharing services that 
allow users to upload files to secure online storage sites from which the files 
can be shared with others. Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox are other  leading 
cyberlocker services. They feature both free and paid services, depending on 
the amount of storage space and administration required. Users are able to 
synchronize their files stored online with their local PCs and other kinds of 
devices, with options for making the files private or public and for sharing them 
with designated contacts. 
Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive are integrated with tools for document 
creation and sharing. OneDrive provides online storage for Microsoft Office 
documents and other files and works with Microsoft Office apps, both installed 
and on the Web. It can share to Facebook as well. Google Drive is integrated 
with Google Docs, a suite of productivity applications that offer collaborative 
editing on documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Google’s cloud-based 
productivity suite for businesses (word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, 
calendars, and mail) called Google Apps for Business also works with Google 
Drive. 
Google Sites allows users to quickly create online team-oriented sites where 
multiple people can collaborate and share files. Google+ is Google’s effort to 
make these tools and other products and services it offers more “social” for 
both consumer and business use. Google+ users can create a profile as well as 
“Circles,” for organizing people into specific groups for sharing and collaborat-
ing. “Hangouts” enable people to engage in group video chat, with a maximum 
of 10 people participating at any point in time. 
Microsoft SharePoint Microsoft SharePoint is a browser-based collaboration 
and document management platform, combined with a powerful search engine 
that is installed on corporate servers. SharePoint has a Web-based interface and 
close integration with everyday tools such as Microsoft Office desktop software 
products. SharePoint software makes it possible for employees to share their 
documents and collaborate on projects using Office documents as the 
 foundation.
SharePoint can be used to host internal Web sites that organize and store 
 information in one central workspace to enable teams to coordinate work 
 activities, collaborate on and publish documents, maintain task lists, implement 
workflows, and share information via wikis and blogs. Users are able to control 
versions of documents and document security. Because SharePoint stores and 
organizes information in one place, users can find relevant information quickly 
and efficiently while working together closely on tasks, projects, and documents. 
Enterprise search tools help locate people, expertise, and content. SharePoint 
now features social tools.

The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is an independent statutory office of 
the Australian federal government that provides advice and related services to 
employers and employees on workplace relations and entitlements. FWO has 
around 800 full time staff in offices in all Australian capital cities and 18 regional 
locations. FWO had been overwhelmed with the details of project management 
and compliance, with staff having to draw information from many different 
 systems and piece it together manually. FWO implemented Microsoft Sharepoint 
Server to create a single organization-wide secure and reliable platform for 
 managing and reporting on Projects, Programs, and Portfolios that would also 
facilitate collaboration. The Sharepoint system captures all project types under-
taken by FWO; supports built-in user roles, views and security; provides storage 
and access to data, including project documentation; and automates workflows, 
including approvals, alerts and communication (Microsoft, 2014). 
IBM Notes IBM Notes (formerly Lotus Notes)is a collaborative software  system 
with capabilities for sharing calendars, e-mail, messaging, collective writing 
and editing, shared database access, and electronic meetings. Notes software 
installed on desktop or laptop computers obtains applications stored on an IBM 
Domino server. Notes is Web-enabled, and offers an application development 
environment so that users can build custom applications to suit their unique 
needs. Notes has also added capabilities for blogs, microblogs, wikis, RSS 
 aggregators, help desk systems, voice and video conferencing, and online 
 meetings. A related IBM product called Quickr provides more specialized tools 
for teamwork (team spaces, content libraries, discussion forums, wikis) and is 
able to access information from Notes. 
IBM Notes promises high levels of security and reliability, and the ability to 
retain control over sensitive corporate information. Finncontainers, a Helsinki, 
Finland logistics company specializing in the sale, rental, and transportation of 
new and used shipping containers, selected Notes as a dependable  collaboration 
platform on which to build a strong network of partners, suppliers and custom-
ers. The company did not want to miss sales opportunities if its e-mail system 
went down suddenly. (IBM, 2013).
Enterprise Social Networking Tools The tools we have just described 
include capabilities for supporting social business, but there are also more 
 specialized social tools for this purpose, such as Salesforce Chatter, Microsoft’s 
Yammer, Jive, and IBM Connections. Enterprise social networking tools create 
business value by connecting the members of an organization through profiles, 
updates, and notifications, similar to Facebook features, but tailored to internal 
corporate uses. Table 2.4 provides more detail about these internal social 
 capabilities. 
Although companies have benefited from enterprise social networking, 
internal social networking has not caught on as quickly as consumer uses of 
Facebook, Twitter, and other public social networking products. The Interactive 
Session on Management addresses this topic.
Checklist for Managers: Evaluating and Selecting 
Collaboration and Social Software Tools
With so many collaboration and social business tools and services  available, 
how do you choose the right collaboration technology for your firm? To answer 
this question, you need a framework for understanding just what problems 
these tools are designed to solve. One framework that has been helpful for 
us to talk about collaboration tools is the time/space collaboration and social 
tool matrix  developed in the early 1990s by a number of collaborative work 
 scholars (Figure 2.8).
 
Chapter 2 Global E-business and Collaboration 
95

The time/space matrix focuses on two dimensions of the collaboration 
 problem: time and space. For instance, you need to collaborate with people in 
different time zones and you cannot all meet at the same time. Midnight in 
New York is noon in Bombay, so this makes it difficult to have a videoconfer-
ence (the people in New York are too tired). Time is clearly an obstacle to 
 collaboration on a global scale.

work on projects, with the ability to set up private and public groups 
and to archive conversations to preserve team knowledge. 
Tagging and Social Bookmarking
Indicate preferences for specific pieces of content, similar to the 
Facebook “like” button. Tagging lets people add keywords to identify 
content they like.
Permissions and Privacy
Ability to make sure private information stays within the right circles, 
as determined by the nature of relationships. In enterprise social 
networks,there is a need to establish who in the company has 
permission to see what information.

THE TIME/SPACE COLLABORATION AND SOCIAL TOOL MATRIX
Collaboration and social technologies can be classified in terms of whether they support interactions 
at the same or different time or place, and whether these interactions are remote or colocated.

Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

Social networking has never been more popular, 
with social tools accounting for 20 percent of all 
online activity, according to ComScore. Many of 
today’s employees are already well versed in the 
basics of public social networking using tools such 
as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Larry Ellison, 
head of the giant software firm Oracle, even went so 
far as to declare that social networking should be the 
backbone of business applications and that Facebook 
is a good model for how users should interact with 
software. But when it comes to actually using social 
tools for internal business purposes, the results have 
been mixed. 
Information Week’s 2013 Social Networking in 
the Enterprise Survey found that only 18 percent of 
respondents believed their internal social network-
ing programs were successful. The Information Week 
survey cited lackluster adoption as a major obstacle 
to success. As with many technology upgrades, 
companies that have tried to deploy internal social 
networks have found that employees are used to 
doing business in a certain way, and overcoming that 
organizational inertia can prove difficult. IT leaders 
hoping to switch to a more social, collaborative office 
culture usually find that most employees still prefer 
to use e-mail, for example. The employees may feel 
too time-pressed to learn a new software tool. 
Employees who are used to collaborating and 
doing business in more traditional ways need an 
incentive to use social software. Most companies 
are not providing that incentive: only 22 percent 
of social software users believe the technology to 
be necessary to their jobs. You might join Facebook 
because all your friends are on it, but in the work-
place, ease of use and increased job efficiency are 
more important than peer pressure in driving adop-
tion.
IT organizations need to take charge to ensure 
that the internal and external social networking 
efforts of the company are providing genuine value 
to the business. Content on the networks needs to be 
relevant, up-to-date, and easy to access; users need 
to be able to connect to people that have the infor-
mation they need and that would otherwise be out 
of reach or difficult to reach. Social business tools 
should be appropriate for the tasks on hand and the 
organization’s business processes, and users need to 
understand how and why to use them.
I NTE R A C T IV E  S E S S IO N : MA N A G E ME N T 
IS SOCIAL BUSINESS WORKING OUT?
In the summer of 2009, the NASA’s Goddard 
Space Flight Center launched a custom-built enter-
prise social network called Spacebook to help small 
teams collaborate without e-mailing larger groups. 
Spacebook featured user profiles, group workspaces 
(wikis, file sharing, discussion forums, groups), and 
social bookmarks. Very few users adopted it, and 
Spacebook was decommissioned on June 1, 2012. 
According to Kevin Jones, a consulting social and 
organizational strategist at NASA’s Marshall and 
Goddard Space Flight Centers, Spacebook failed 
because it didn’t focus enough on people. It had 
been designed and developed without taking into 
 consideration the organization’s culture and  politics. 
No one knew how Spacebook would help them 
do their jobs, as opposed to an existing method of 
 collaboration such as e-mail.
Despite the pitfalls associated with launching 
an internal social network, there are companies 
using these networks successfully. For example, 
Red Robin, a chain of 355 restaurants with over 
20,000  employees, uses social networking to give its 
front-line employees who interact with customers 
a greater voice in the company. Chris Laping, Red 
Robin’s CIO and senior vice-president of business 
transformation believed that engaging these workers 
would also increase employee loyalty. 
Red Robin decided to try out Yammer, which is 
referred to as a “Facebook for business.” Yammer 
lets people create conversations, perform  status 
updates, upload and share files, and set up 
 workgroups for small project teams. The social 
 collaboration software would allow Red Robin to 
get out a message and receive immediate feedback, 
so that the company could rapidly make modifica-
tions. For example, when Red Robin introduced 
its new Tavern Burger product line in April, 2012, 
it was able to refine the recipes and operational 
 procedures in restaurants in about four weeks. The 
process would have taken 6 to 18 months in the 
past. Guests reported their feedback to servers in 
the restaurants, who relayed this information to 
their managers. Then all the managers got together 
right away on Yammer. 
Red Robin used a viral approach to drive  adoption. 
In the first month, 20 to 25 employees started using 
it and invited others. Membership spread quickly and 
Red Robin wound up with two Yammer networks:

Place (location) also inhibits collaboration in large global or even national 
and regional firms. Assembling people for a physical meeting is made difficult 
by the physical dispersion of distributed firms (firms with more than one 
 location), the cost of travel, and the time limitations of managers.
The collaboration and social technologies we have just described are ways of 
overcoming the limitations of time and space. Using this time/space frame-
work will help you to choose the most appropriate collaboration and teamwork 
tools for your firm. Note that some tools are applicable in more than one time/
place scenario. For example, Internet collaboration suites such as Lotus Notes 
have capabilities for both synchronous (instant messaging, electronic meeting 
tools) and asynchronous (e-mail, wikis, document editing) interactions.
Here’s a “to-do” list to get started. If you follow these six steps, you should be 
led to investing in the correct collaboration software for your firm at a price you 
can afford, and within your risk tolerance.
1. What are the collaboration challenges facing the firm in terms of time and 
space? Locate your firm in the time/space matrix. Your firm can occupy more 
than one cell in the matrix. Different collaboration tools will be needed for each 
situation.
2. Within each cell of the matrix where your firm faces challenges, exactly what 
kinds of solutions are available? Make a list of vendor products.
3. Analyze each of the products in terms of their cost and benefits to your firm. 
Be sure to include the costs of training in your cost estimates, and the costs of 
involving the information systems department, if needed.

4. Identify the risks to security and vulnerability involved with each of the products. 
Is your firm willing to put proprietary information into the hands of external 
service providers over the Internet? Is your firm willing to risk its important 
operations to systems controlled by other firms? What are the financial risks 
facing your vendors? Will they be here in three to five years? What would be the 
cost of making a switch to another vendor in the event the vendor firm fails?
5. Seek the help of potential users to identify implementation and training issues. 
Some of these tools are easier to use than others.
6. Make your selection of candidate tools, and invite the vendors to make 
presentations.

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS FUNCTION IN A BUSINESS?
We’ve seen that businesses need information systems to operate today and 
that they use many different kinds of systems. But who is responsible for 
 running these systems? Who is responsible for making sure the hardware, 
software, and other technologies used by these systems are running properly 
and are up to date? End users manage their systems from a business stand-
point, but managing the technology requires a special information systems 
function.
In all but the smallest of firms, the information systems department is the 
formal organizational unit responsible for information technology services. The 
information systems department is responsible for maintaining the hardware, 
software, data storage, and networks that comprise the firm’s IT infrastructure. 
We describe IT infrastructure in detail in Chapter 5.
THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS DEPARTMENT
The information systems department consists of specialists, such as program-
mers, systems analysts, project leaders, and information systems managers. 
Programmers are highly trained technical specialists who write the software 
instructions for computers. Systems analysts constitute the principal liaisons 
between the information systems groups and the rest of the organization. It 
is the systems analyst’s job to translate business problems and requirements 
into information requirements and systems. Information systems managers 
are leaders of teams of programmers and analysts, project managers, physical 
facility managers, telecommunications managers, or database specialists. They 
are also managers of computer operations and data entry staff. Also, external 
specialists, such as hardware vendors and manufacturers, software firms, and 
consultants, frequently participate in the day-to-day operations and long-term 
planning of information systems.
In many companies, the information systems department is headed by a chief 
information officer (CIO). The CIO is a senior manager who oversees the 
use of information technology in the firm. Today’s CIOs are expected to have 
a strong business background as well as information systems expertise and to 
play a  leadership role in integrating technology into the firm’s business strategy. 
Large firms today also have positions for a chief security officer, chief knowledge 
 officer, and chief privacy officer, all of whom work closely with the CIO.
The chief security officer (CSO) is in charge of information systems 
 security for the firm and is responsible for enforcing the firm’s information 
 
Chapter 2 Global E-business and Collaboration 
99

security policy (see Chapter 8). (Sometimes this position is called the chief 
information security officer [CISO] where information systems security is 
 separated from physical security.) The CSO is responsible for educating and 
training users and information systems specialists about security, keeping 
management aware of security threats and breakdowns, and maintaining the 
tools and policies chosen to implement security.
Information systems security and the need to safeguard personal data have 
become so important that corporations collecting vast quantities of personal 
data have established positions for a chief privacy officer (CPO). The CPO is 
responsible for ensuring that the company complies with existing data privacy 
laws.
The chief knowledge officer (CKO) is responsible for the firm’s  knowledge 
management program. The CKO helps design programs and systems to find 
new sources of knowledge or to make better use of existing knowledge in 
 organizational and management processes.
The chief data officer (CDO) is responsible for enterprise-wide  governance 
and utilization of information to maximize the value the organization can 
 realize from its data. The CDO ensures that the firm is collecting the appropri-
ate data to serve its needs, deploying appropriate technologies for analyzing the 
data and using the results to support business decisions. This position arose to 
deal with the massive amounts of data organizations are now generating and 
 collecting (see Chapter 6).
End users are representatives of departments outside of the information 
 systems group for whom applications are developed. These users are playing an 
increasingly large role in the design and development of information systems.
In the early years of computing, the information systems group was  composed 
mostly of programmers who performed highly specialized but limited technical 
functions. Today, a growing proportion of staff members are systems analysts 
and network specialists, with the information systems department acting as a 
powerful change agent in the organization. The information systems depart-
ment suggests new business strategies and new information-based products 
and services, and coordinates both the development of the technology and the 
planned changes in the organization.
In the next five years, employment growth in IS/MIS jobs will be about 
50  percent greater than the average job growth in other fields. Out of 114 
occupations, MIS is ranked 15th in terms of salaries. While all IS occupations 
show above-average growth, the fastest growing occupations are computer 
 support specialists (30%), systems analysts (21%), software engineers and 
 programmers (20%), and information systems managers (17%) (Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, 2012). With businesses and government agencies increasingly 
relying on the Internet for computing and communication resources, system 
and network security management positions are especially in demand. See 
the Learning Track for this chapter titled “Occupational and Career Outlook 
for Information Systems Majors 2012–2018” for more details on IS job 
opportunities.
ORGANIZING THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS FUNCTION
There are many types of business firms, and there are many ways in which 
the IT function is organized within the firm. A very small company will not 
have a formal information systems group. It might have one employee who 
is  responsible for keeping its networks and applications running, or it might 
100 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

use consultants for these services. Larger companies will have a separate 
 information systems department, which may be organized along several 
 different lines, depending on the nature and interests of the firm. Our Learning 
Track describes alternative ways of organizing the information systems  function 
within the business.
The question of how the information systems department should be  organized 
is part of the larger issue of IT governance. IT governance includes the 
 strategy and policies for using information technology within an  organization. 
It  specifies the decision rights and framework for accountability to ensure that 
the use of information technology supports the organization’s strategies and 
objectives. How much should the information systems function be  centralized? 
What decisions must be made to ensure effective management and use of 
 information technology, including the return on IT investments? Who should 
make these decisions? How will these decisions be made and monitored? Firms 
with superior IT governance will have clearly thought out the answers (Weill 
and Ross, 2004). 
Review Summary
1. What are business processes? How are they related to information systems?
A business process is a logically related set of activities that defines how specific business tasks are 
performed, and it represents a unique way in which an organization coordinates work, information, 
and knowledge. Managers need to pay attention to business processes because they determine how 
well the organization can execute its business, and they may be a source of strategic advantage. There 
are business processes specific to each of the major business functions, but many business processes 
are cross-functional. Information systems automate parts of business processes, and they can help 
organizations redesign and streamline these processes. 
2. How do systems serve the different management groups in a business and how do systems that link the 
enterprise improve organizational performance? 
Systems serving operational management are transaction processing systems (TPS), such as payroll 
or order processing, that track the flow of the daily routine transactions necessary to conduct business. 
Management information systems (MIS) produce reports serving middle management by condensing 
information from TPS, and these are not highly analytical. Decision-support systems (DSS) support 
management decisions that are unique and rapidly changing using advanced analytical models. All of 
these types of systems provide business intelligence that helps managers and enterprise employees 
make more informed decisions. These systems for business intelligence serve multiple levels of 
 management, and include executive support systems (ESS) for senior management that provide data 
in the form of graphs, charts, and dashboards delivered via portals using many sources of internal and 
external information.
Enterprise applications are designed to coordinate multiple functions and business processes. 
Enterprise systems integrate the key internal business processes of a firm into a single software  system 
to improve coordination and decision making. Supply chain management systems help the firm 
 manage its relationship with suppliers to optimize the planning, sourcing, manufacturing, and  delivery 
of products and services. Customer relationship management (CRM) systems coordinate the business 
processes surrounding the firm’s customers. Knowledge management systems enable firms to  optimize 
the creation, sharing, and distribution of knowledge. Intranets and extranets are private corporate 
 networks based on Internet technology that assemble information from disparate systems. Extranets 
make portions of private corporate intranets available to outsiders.

3. Why are systems for collaboration and social business so important and what technologies do they use? 
Collaboration is working with others to achieve shared and explicit goals. Social business is the use of 
internal and external social networking platforms to engage employees, customers, and suppliers, and it can 
enhance collaborative work. Collaboration and social business have become increasingly important in 
 business because of globalization, the decentralization of decision making, and growth in jobs where interac-
tion is the primary value-adding activity. Collaboration and social business enhance innovation, productivity, 
quality, and customer service. Tools for collaboration and social business include e-mail and instant messag-
ing, wikis, virtual meeting systems, virtual worlds, cloud-based cyberlockers and online services such as 
those of Google and Microsoft, corporate collaboration systems such as Microsoft Sharepoint, and  enterprise 
social networking tools such as Chatter, Yammer, Jive, and IBM Connections.

 Fulbert Timber Merchants in Brixton, UK features a large selection of building supplies, including tim-
ber, fencing and decking, mouldings, hardwood flooring, sheet materials, windows, doors, ironmon-
gery, and other materials. The prices of building materials are constantly changing. When a customer 
inquires about the price on fixtures, fittings, hangings, and other items, sales representatives consult a 
manual price sheet and then call the supplier for the most recent price. The supplier in turn uses a 
manual price sheet, which has been updated each day. Often, the supplier must call back Fulbert’s 
sales reps because the company does not have the newest pricing information immediately on hand. 
Assess the business impact of this situation, describe how this process could be improved with infor-
mation technology, and identify the decisions that would have to be made to implement a solution.

Business skills: Analyzing supplier performance and pricing
2-10 
 In this exercise, you will learn how to use spreadsheet software to improve management decisions about 
selecting suppliers. You will filter transactional data on suppliers based on several different criteria to 
select the best suppliers for your company.
You run a company that manufactures aircraft components. You have many competitors who are 
trying to offer lower prices and better service to customers, and you are trying to determine whether you 
can benefit from better supply chain management. In MyMISLab, you will find a spreadsheet file that 
 contains a list of all of the items that your firm has ordered from its suppliers during the past three months. 
The fields in the spreadsheet file include vendor name, vendor identification number,  purchaser’s order 
number, item identification number and item description (for each item ordered from the vendor), cost per 
item, number of units of the item ordered (quantity), total cost of each order,  vendor’s accounts payable 
terms, order date, and actual arrival date for each order.
Prepare a recommendation of how you can use the data in this spreadsheet database to improve your 
decisions about selecting suppliers. Some criteria to consider for identifying preferred suppliers include the 
supplier’s track record for on-time deliveries, suppliers offering the best accounts payable terms, and suppli-
ers offering lower pricing when the same item can be provided by multiple suppliers. Use your spreadsheet 
software to prepare reports to support your recommendations.

Modernization of NTUC Income
CASE STUDY
N
TUC Income (Income), one of Singapore’s 
largest insurers, has over 2 million policy 
holders with total assets of S$31.3 billion. 
The insurer employs about 3,400 insur-
ance advisors and 1,200 office staff, with the major-
ity located across an eight-branch network. In 2014, 
the company solidified its status as a market leader 
in Singapore, but its modernization began years ago 
with a critical information systems upgrade.
On June 1, 2003, Income succeeded in the migra-
tion of its legacy insurance systems to a digital Web-
based system. The Herculean task required not only 
the upgrading of hardware and applications, it also 
required Income to streamline its decade-old busi-
ness processes and IT practices.
Up until a few years prior to the revamp, Income’s 
insurance processes were very tedious and paper-
based. The entire insurance process started with 
customers meeting an agent, filling in forms, and 
submitting documents. The agent would then submit 
the forms at branches, from where they were sent 
by couriers to the office services department. The 
collection schedule could introduce delays of two 
to three days. Office Services would log documents, 
sort them, and then send them to departments for 
underwriting. Proposals were allocated to underwrit-
ing staff, mostly randomly. Accepted proposals were 
sent for printing at the computer services depart-
ment and then redistributed. For storage, all original 
documents were packed and sent to warehouses 
where, over two to three days, a total of seven staff 
would log and store the documents. In all, paper poli-
cies comprising 45 million documents were stored in 
over 16,000 cartons at three warehouses. Whenever a 
document needed to be retrieved, it would take about 
two days to locate and ship it by courier. Refiling 
would again take about two days.
In 2002, despite periodic investments to upgrade 
the HP 3000 mainframe that hosted the core insur-
ance applications as well as the accounting and 
management information systems, it still frequently 
broke down. According to James Kang, then CIO at 
Income, “The system breakdowns were a real night-
mare. Work would stop and the staff had to choose 
either data reconciliation, or backup. However, the 
HP 3000 backup system allowed restoration to only 
up to the previous day’s backup data. If the daily 
backup was not completed at the end of the day, 
the affected day’s data would be lost and costly and 
tedious reconciliation would be needed to bring the 
data up to date.” In one of the hardware crashes, rec-
onciliation took several months to restore the data 
loss. In all, the HP 3000 system experienced a total of 
three major hardware failures, resulting in a total of 
six days of complete downtime.
That was not enough. The COBOL programs that 
were developed in the early 1980s and maintained by 
Income’s in-house IT team also broke multiple times, 
halted the systems, and caused temporary interrup-
tions. In addition, the IT team found developing new 
products in COBOL to be quite cumbersome and the 
time taken to launch new products ranged from a 
few weeks to months.
At the same time, transaction processing for 
policy underwriting was still a batch process and 
information was not available to agents and advisors 
in real-time. As a result, when staff processed a new 
customer application for motor insurance, they did 
not know if the applicant was an existing customer 
of Income, which led to the loss of opportunities for 
cross-product sales. Commenting on the problems 
faced by the agents, Kang said, “When the agents 
tried to submit the documents using notebooks, they 
ran into a lot of problems. HP 3000 was a terrible 
machine to connect to such devices. And with more 
of the advisors telecommuting, availability became 
an issue too.” In addition, various departments did 
not have up-to-date information and had to pass 
physical documents among each other.
All this changed in June 2003, when Income 
switched to the Java-based eBao LifeSystem from 
eBao Technology. The software comprised three sub-
systems: Policy Administration, Sales Management, 
and Supplementary Resources. Commenting on its 
features, Kang said, “It has everything we are looking 
for —a customer-centric design, seamless integra-
tion with imaging and barcode technology, a product 
definition module that supports new products, new 
channels and changes in business processes.” 
Implementation work started in September 2002 
and the project was completed in nine months. By 
May 2003, all the customization, data migration of 
Income’s individual and group life insurance busi-
nesses and training were completed.

The new system was immediately operational on 
a high-availability platform. All applications resided 
on two or more servers, each connected by two or 
more communication lines, all of which were “load 
balanced.” This robust architecture minimized down-
time occurrence due to hardware or operating sys-
tem failures.
As part of eBao implementation, Income decided 
to replace its entire IT infrastructure with a more 
robust, scalable architecture. For example, all servic-
ing branches were equipped with scanners; moni-
tors were changed to 20 inches; PC RAM size was 
upgraded to 128 MB; and new hardware and soft-
ware for application servers, database servers, Web 
servers, and disk storage systems were installed. 
Furthermore, the LAN cables were replaced with 
faster cables, a fiber-optic backbone, and wireless 
capability.
In addition, Income also revamped its business 
continuity and disaster-recovery plans. A real-time 
hot backup disaster-recovery center was imple-
mented, where the machines were always running 
and fully operational. Data was transmitted immedi-
ately on the fly from the primary data center to the 
backup machines’ data storage. In the event of the 
data center site becoming unavailable, the operations 
could be switched quickly to the disaster-recovery 
site without the need to rely on restoration of previ-
ous day data.
Moving to a paperless environment, however, 
was not easy. Income had to throw away all paper 
records, including legal paper documents. Under the 
new system, all documents were scanned and stored 
on ”trusted” storage devices —secured, reliable digital 
vaults that enabled strict compliance with stringent 
statutory requirements. Income had to train employ-
ees who had been accustomed to working with paper 
to use the eBao system and change the way they 
worked.
As a result of adopting eBao Life System, about 
500 office staff and 3,400 insurance advisors could 
access the system anytime, anywhere. Staff members 
who would telecommute enjoyed faster access to 
information, almost as fast as those who accessed the 
information in the office.
According to Kang, “We got a singular view of 
every customer—across products and channels and 
even better life and general insurance business 
lines. That allowed us opportunities to cross-sell and 
improve customer service. In addition, because of 
the straight through processing workflow capabilities, 
we had 50 percent savings on both the time and cost 
needed to process policies. We had also cut the time 
needed to design and launch new products which 
was reduced from weeks to just days using the table-
driven rule-based product-definition module.”
Commenting on the benefits of eBao system, 
former CEO Tan Kin Lian remarked, “…eBaoTech 
LifeSystem has the best straight through process-
ing workflow and it is very flexible. It cuts our new 
product launch time from months to days. It also 
allows us to support agents, brokers, and customers 
to do online services easily. I got a fantastic deal: the 
best system with much lower cost and much shorter 
implementation time. I have to say that this is a 
revolution!”
Although the eBao system has undergone 
improvements since its initial rollout, Income’s cul-
ture of innovation and modernization continues. In 
2011, Income announced plans to invest $4 million 
annually to improve its customer service as part 
of its “Orange Revolution” campaign. The broader 
goal of the campaign was to establish NTUC Income 
as a friendlier, more honest insurance company 
known for superlative customer service. The sub-
goals include Orange Speak, to standardize usage of 
simple-to-understand English across the firm, and 
Orange Force, to create a more visible presence of 
NTUC Income insurance advisors in the public eye. 
For example, as part of Orange Speak, the com-
pany released a series of television advertisements 
and videos poking fun at the insurance industry’s 
complicated verbiage, casting themselves as a sim-
pler, more straightforward alternative. As part of 
Orange Force, the company created a task force of 
30 motorcyclists with a distinctive orange NTUC 
Income color palette with the objective of being able 
to ride to traffic accidents in the surrounding areas 
within 20 minutes.
In 2014, the campaign was finally completed and 
has been a resounding success, resulting in multiple 
national awards for exemplary service, a reduction 
of average monthly complaints from 274 before the 
launch of the campaign to approximately 70 midway 
through the campaign’s completion, and improving 
the company’s bottom line, boosting profits slightly 
over the course of the campaign.
Technologically, the company continues to keep 
pace. In 2013, Income adopted Singapore’s national 
two-factor authentication system, becoming the first 
local insurer to do so. The system uses a physical 
token resembling a credit card that links to indi-
vidual NTUC Income accounts and generates one-
use passwords for online transactions. The system 
will help NTUC policyholders to stay safe online 
while sharing sensitive personal information. The 
106 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

company also continues to bolster its policy offer-
ings, announcing plans to extend insurance to chil-
dren with special needs such as Downs syndrome 
and autism, insurance for low-income families with 
young children, and more comprehensive motor-
cycle insurance. The legacy of modernization estab-
lished in the 2000s continues at NTUC Income to the 
present day.

f you drink beer, chances are good you’ve tasted Grupo Modelo products.  
Grupo Modelo is Mexico’s largest brewer of beer, with a capacity of 1.5 bil-
lion gallons annually, placing it in the top ten brewers of the world. The 
brewer also brews beer solely for the local market including Estrella, Leon, 
and  Montejo. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the largest brewer in the world, recently 
completed its acquisition of Grupo Modelo for a purchase price of €14 billion 
euros. InBev already owned 50% of Grupo Modelo from a previous purchase.  
Like many firms that have grown from a collection of enterprises to a regional 
powerhouse and then to a global firm, Grupo Modelo needed to transform its 
administration so that managers could understand the complexity of the now 
larger firm, and compete with other global firms. In the future, Grupo Modelo 
would be competing with other firms on the basis of efficient business pro-
cesses, and not just the taste of its beer.
Grupo Modelo worked with the consulting firm Deloitte Consulting to imple-
ment an SAP enterprise management system, creating a single database for all 
the firm’s business units. With nearly 100 different business units, from its seven 
breweries to convenience stores and distribution centers, the firm was hoping to 
integrate the disparate units and make it possible to manage them using a single 
software environment. The first step in building an enterprise system is to iden-
tify, document, and begin to measure the firm’s business processes.  This can 
take several years. Once identified, managers need to prioritize their efforts by 
focusing on the most important processes and build an administrative apparatus 
to manage them. For instance, there are thousands of business processes in 
large firms. Who will govern these processes?  Who will manage the risks associ-
GRUPO MODELO: COMPETING ON PROCESSES

ated with these processes?  And who will ensure that employees conduct busi-
ness in compliance with the firm’s official processes? These are referred to as 
GRC challenges (for governance, risk, and compliance).   Transforming a tradi-
tional organization into a modern competitive enterprise requires both signifi-
cant cultural change and technology investment.
To address these challenges Grupo Modelo organized a new program to bring 
about the transformation of Grupo Modelo into a process-oriented firm.  The new 
program, the Enterprise Model for Administration Transformation, worked with 
SAP enterprise software modules to build automated dashboards that would allow 
managers throughout the firm to visually observe how the firm’s business pro-
cesses were working.
SAP’s Access Control module formalized security in the firm, ensuring that 
only authorized employees could define business processes and access process 
information, and that there was a proper “segregation of duties” in the firm.   
Segregation of duties is an auditing concept that attempts to prevent fraud and 
errors by spreading tasks and authorizations to specific business processes among 
multiple users. SAP’s Process Control module contains the descriptions of pro-
cesses, regulations that affect the processes, and the extent to which employees 
comply with the processes. The Risk Management module measures and dis-
plays the change risks associated with each process, everything from supplier 
risk, to regulatory changes, and liability issues.  The software tracks key risk indi-
cators and tries to estimate the potential losses and impacts of poor decisions, or 
adverse risk events.
The result of Grupo Modelo’s enterprise systems effort is a unification of a far 
flung company doing business on a global scale, giving management for the first 
time insights into the firm that had been hidden before. Among the benefits cited 
by managers are better security controls throughout the company, automating 
workflows, automated monitoring of processes and risk, and better decision mak-
ing based on the notion that all managers in the firm knew the correct way of 
performing a business process no matter where they were located.

T
he story of Grupo Modelo illustrates some of the ways that information 
systems help businesses compete—and also the challenges of sustain-
ing a competitive advantage. The global beer business is dominated by a few 
consolidated, global firms. These competitors have developed extremely effi-
cient management control systems using enterprise wide software tools.  If it 
was to compete in this environment, Grupo Modelo managers needed to have 
a much more fine-grained understanding of all its business processes, and 
build software tools in the form of desktop dashboards that would permit 
management to operate in real time. The firm also needed tools to ensure 
security, and understand and mitigate risk.
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter. Grupo Modelo faced the challenge of becoming 
a “process oriented” firm, a firm where all the business processes were vis-
ible, measurable, and capable of being changed. The firm needed to identify, 
and then mitigate, security threats and understand the impact of other risks 
on the firm. New technology was one part of the solution: the firm built on 
the enterprise software of SAP by implementing process, security, and risk

WHICH FEATURES OF ORGANIZATIONS DO 
MANAGERS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TO BUILD AND 
USE INFORMATION SYSTEMS SUCCESSFULLY? 
I
nformation systems and organizations influence one another. Information 
systems are built by managers to serve the interests of the business firm. 
At the same time, the organization must be aware of and open to the 
 influences of information systems to benefit from new technologies.
The interaction between information technology and organizations is 
 complex and is influenced by many mediating factors, including the organiza-
tion’s structure, business processes, politics, culture, surrounding environment, 
and management decisions (see Figure 3.1). You will need to understand how 
information systems can change social and work life in your firm. You will 
not be able to design new systems successfully or understand existing systems 
 without understanding your own business organization. 
As a manager, you will be the one to decide which systems will be built, 
what they will do, and how they will be implemented. You may not be able to 
anticipate all of the consequences of these decisions. Some of the changes that 
occur in business firms because of new information technology (IT) invest-
ments cannot be foreseen and have results that may or may not meet your 
expectations. Who would have imagined fifteen years ago, for instance, that 
e-mail and instant messaging would become a dominant form of business 
management modules. In order to raise awareness among all employees of 
the importance of this project, management created a program and a new 
office to implement and manage the transformation towards a process ori-
entation.  A successful implementation required that thousands of the firm’s 
employees had to be trained in the new software and the newly defined busi-
ness processes. The result is an information system that defines and makes 
visible on managers’ desktops the important business processes of the firm.  
Here are some questions to think about: How do competitive forces and 
value chain models apply to Grupo Modelo? What do you think was the most 
difficult challenge Grupo Modelo faced when implementing its new system?

 communication and that many managers would be inundated with more than 
200 e-mail  messages each day? 
WHAT IS AN ORGANIZATION?
An organization is a stable, formal social structure that takes resources 
from the environment and processes them to produce outputs. This techni-
cal  definition focuses on three elements of an organization. Capital and labor 
are primary production factors provided by the environment. The organization 
(the firm) transforms these inputs into products and services in a production 
function. The products and services are consumed by environments in return 
for supply inputs (see Figure 3.2). 
 FIGURE 3.2 
THE TECHNICAL MICROECONOMIC DEFINITION OF THE 
ORGANIZATION
In the microeconomic definition of organizations, capital and labor (the primary production factors 
provided by the environment) are transformed by the firm through the production process into 
products and services (outputs to the environment). The products and services are consumed by the 
environment, which supplies additional capital and labor as inputs in the feedback loop.
 FIGURE 3.1 
THE TWO-WAY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS 
AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
This complex two-way relationship is mediated by many factors, not the least of which are the 
decisions made—or not made—by managers. Other factors mediating the relationship include the 
organizational culture, structure, politics, business processes, and environment.
114 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

An organization is more stable than an informal group (such as a group of 
friends that meets every Friday for lunch) in terms of longevity and routine-
ness. Organizations are formal legal entities with internal rules and  procedures 
that must abide by laws. Organizations are also social structures because they 
are a collection of social elements, much as a machine has a structure—a 
particular arrangement of valves, cams, shafts, and other parts.
This definition of organizations is powerful and simple, but it is not very 
descriptive or even predictive of real-world organizations. A more realistic 
behavioral definition of an organization is a collection of rights,  privileges, 
 obligations, and responsibilities delicately balanced over a period of time 
through conflict and conflict resolution (see Figure 3.3). 
In this behavioral view of the firm, people who work in organizations develop 
customary ways of working; they gain attachments to existing relationships; 
and they make arrangements with subordinates and superiors about how work 
will be done, the amount of work that will be done, and under what conditions 
work will be done. Most of these arrangements and feelings are not discussed 
in any formal rulebook.
How do these definitions of organizations relate to information systems 
technology? A technical view of organizations encourages us to focus on how 
inputs are combined to create outputs when technology changes are introduced 
into the company. The firm is seen as infinitely malleable, with capital and 
labor substituting for each other quite easily. But the more  realistic behavioral 
definition of an organization suggests that building new information systems, 
or rebuilding old ones, involves much more than a technical rearrangement 
of machines or workers—that some information systems change the organi-
zational balance of rights, privileges, obligations, responsibilities, and feelings 
that have been established over a long period of time. 
Changing these elements can take a long time, be very disruptive, and 
requires more resources to support training and learning. For instance, the 
length of time required to implement a new information system effectively is 
much longer than usually anticipated simply because there is a lag between 
implementing a technical system and teaching employees and managers how 
to use the system. 
 FIGURE 3.3 
THE BEHAVIORAL VIEW OF ORGANIZATIONS
The behavioral view of organizations emphasizes group relationships, values, and structures.
 
Chapter 3 Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy 
115

Technological change requires changes in who owns and controls 
 information, who has the right to access and update that information, and 
who makes decisions about whom, when, and how. This more complex view 
forces us to look at the way work is designed and the procedures used to 
achieve outputs.
The technical and behavioral definitions of organizations are not con-
tradictory. Indeed, they complement each other: The technical definition 
tells us how thousands of firms in competitive markets combine capital, 
labor, and information technology, whereas the behavioral model takes us 
inside the individual firm to see how that technology affects the organiza-
tion’s inner workings. Section 3.2 describes how each of these definitions 
of  organizations can help explain the relationships between information 
 systems and organizations. 
FEATURES OF ORGANIZATIONS
All modern organizations share certain characteristics. They are bureaucra-
cies with clear-cut divisions of labor and specialization. Organizations arrange 
 specialists in a hierarchy of authority in which everyone is accountable to 
someone and authority is limited to specific actions governed by abstract rules 
or procedures. These rules create a system of impartial and universal  decision 
making. Organizations try to hire and promote employees on the basis of 
 technical qualifications and professionalism (not personal connections). The 
organization is devoted to the principle of efficiency: maximizing output using 
limited inputs. Other features of organizations include their business processes, 
organizational culture, organizational politics, surrounding environments, 
structure, goals, constituencies, and leadership styles. All of these features 
affect the kinds of information systems used by organizations. 
Routines and Business Processes
All organizations, including business firms, become very efficient over time 
because individuals in the firm develop routines for producing goods and 
 services. Routines—sometimes called standard operating procedures—are precise 
rules, procedures, and practices that have been developed to cope with virtually 
all expected situations. As employees learn these routines, they become highly 
productive and efficient, and the firm is able to reduce its costs over time as 
efficiency increases. For instance, when you visit a doctor’s office, receptionists 
have a well-developed set of routines for gathering basic information from you; 
nurses have a different set of routines for preparing you for an interview with a 
doctor; and the doctor has a well-developed set of routines for diagnosing you. 
Business processes, which we introduced in Chapters 1 and 2, are collections of 
such routines. A business firm, in turn, is a collection of business processes 
(Figure 3.4). 
Organizational Politics
People in organizations occupy different positions with different specialties, 
 concerns, and perspectives. As a result, they naturally have divergent  viewpoints 
about how resources, rewards, and punishments should be  distributed. These 
differences matter to both managers and employees, and they result in  political 
struggle for resources, competition, and conflict within every organization. 
Political resistance is one of the great difficulties of  bringing about organizational 
change—especially the development of new information systems. Virtually all 
large information systems investments by a firm that bring about significant 
116 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

changes in strategy, business objectives, business  processes, and procedures 
become politically charged events. Managers who know how to work with the 
politics of an organization will be more successful than less-skilled managers 
in implementing new information systems. Throughout this book, you will 
find many examples where internal politics defeated the best-laid plans for an 
 information system.
Organizational Culture
All organizations have bedrock, unassailable, unquestioned (by the  members) 
assumptions that define their goals and products. Organizational culture 
encompasses this set of assumptions about what products the organization 
should produce, how it should produce them, where, and for whom. Generally, 
these cultural assumptions are taken totally for granted and are rarely publicly 
announced or discussed. Business processes—the actual way business firms 
produce value—are usually ensconced in the organization’s culture. 
You can see organizational culture at work by looking around your univer-
sity or college. Some bedrock assumptions of university life are that profes-
sors know more than students, the reason students attend college is to learn, 
and classes follow a regular schedule. Organizational culture is a powerful 
 FIGURE 3.4 
ROUTINES, BUSINESS PROCESSES, AND FIRMS
All organizations are composed of individual routines and behaviors, a collection of which make up 
a business process. A collection of business processes make up the business firm. New information 
system applications require that individual routines and business processes change to achieve high 
levels of organizational performance. 
 
Chapter 3 Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy 
117

unifying force that restrains political conflict and promotes common under-
standing, agreement on procedures, and common practices. If we all share the 
same basic cultural assumptions, agreement on other matters is more likely.
At the same time, organizational culture is a powerful restraint on change, 
especially technological change. Most organizations will do almost anything 
to avoid making changes in basic assumptions. Any technological change that 
threatens commonly held cultural assumptions usually meets a great deal of 
resistance. However, there are times when the only sensible way for a firm to 
move forward is to employ a new technology that directly opposes an existing 
organizational culture. When this occurs, the technology is often stalled while 
the culture slowly adjusts.
Organizational Environments
Organizations reside in environments from which they draw resources and 
to which they supply goods and services. Organizations and environments 
have a reciprocal relationship. On the one hand, organizations are open to, 
and dependent on, the social and physical environment that surrounds them. 
Without financial and human resources—people willing to work reliably 
and consistently for a set wage or revenue from customers—organizations 
could not exist. Organizations must respond to legislative and other require-
ments imposed by government, as well as the actions of customers and com-
petitors. On the other hand, organizations can influence their environments. 
For example, business firms form alliances with other businesses to influence 
the political process; they advertise to influence customer acceptance of their 
products.
Figure 3.5 illustrates the role of information systems in helping organiza-
tions perceive changes in their environments and also in helping organiza-
tions act on their environments. Information systems are key instruments for

and decide to change environments altogether. Information technology plays a critical role in helping 
organizations perceive environmental change and in helping organizations act on their environment.

environmental scanning, helping managers identify external changes that might 
require an organizational response.
Environments generally change much faster than organizations. New 
 technologies, new products, and changing public tastes and values (many of 
which result in new government regulations) put strains on any organization’s 
culture, politics, and people. Most organizations are unable to adapt to a rapidly 
changing environment. Inertia built into an organization’s standard operating 
procedures, the political conflict raised by changes to the existing order, and the 
threat to closely held cultural values inhibit organizations from making signifi-
cant changes. Young firms typically lack resources to sustain even short periods 
of troubled times. It is not surprising that only 10 percent of the Fortune 500 
companies in 1919 still exist today. 
Disruptive Technologies: Riding the Wave. Sometimes a technology and 
resulting business innovation comes along to radically change the business 
landscape and environment. These innovations are loosely called “disruptive.” 
(Christensen, 2003). What makes a technology disruptive? In some cases, 
 disruptive technologies are substitute products that perform as well as or bet-
ter (often much better) than anything currently produced. The car substituted 
for the horse-drawn carriage; the word processor for typewriters; the Apple 
iPod for portable CD players; digital photography for process film photography. 
In these cases, entire industries were put out of business. In other cases, 
 disruptive technologies simply extend the market, usually with less function-
ality and much less cost, than existing products. Eventually they turn into 
low-cost competitors for whatever was sold before. Disk drives are an  example: 
Small hard disk drives used in PCs extended the market for disk drives by 
 offering cheap digital storage for small files. Eventually, small PC hard disk 
drives became the largest segment of the disk drive marketplace. 
Some firms are able to create these technologies and ride the wave to  profits; 
others learn quickly and adapt their business; still others are obliterated because 
their products, services, and business models become obsolete. They may be 
very efficient at doing what no longer needs to be done! There are also cases 
where no firms benefit, and all the gains go to consumers (firms fail to capture 
any profits). Table 3.1 describes just a few disruptive technologies from the past.
Disruptive technologies are tricky. Firms that invent disruptive technologies 
as “first movers” do not always benefit if they lack the resources to exploit the 
technology or fail to see the opportunity. The MITS Altair 8800 is widely 
regarded as the first PC, but its inventors did not take advantage of their first 
mover status. Second movers, so-called “fast followers” such as IBM and 
Microsoft, reaped the rewards. Citibank’s ATMs revolutionized retail banking, 
but they were copied by other banks. Now all banks use ATMs, with the benefits 
going mostly to the consumers.
Organizational Structure
All organizations have a structure or shape. Mintzberg’s classification, described 
in Table 3.2, identifies five basic kinds of organizational structure (Mintzberg, 
1979).
The kind of information systems you find in a business firm—and the nature 
of problems with these systems—often reflects the type of organizational 
 structure. For instance, in a professional bureaucracy such as a hospital, it is 
not unusual to find parallel patient record systems operated by the administra-
tion, another by doctors, and another by other professional staff such as nurses 
and social workers. In small entrepreneurial firms, you will often find poorly

designed systems developed in a rush that often quickly outgrow their useful-
ness. In huge multidivisional firms operating in hundreds of locations, you will 
often find there is not a single integrating information system, but instead each 
locale or each division has its set of information systems.

Other Organizational Features
Organizations have goals and use different means to achieve them. Some 
 organizations have coercive goals (e.g., prisons); others have utilitarian goals 
(e.g., businesses). Still others have normative goals (universities, religious 
groups). Organizations also serve different groups or have different constitu-
encies, some primarily benefiting their members, others benefiting clients, 
stockholders, or the public. The nature of leadership differs greatly from one 
organization to another—some organizations may be more democratic or 
authoritarian than others. Another way organizations differ is by the tasks they 
perform and the technology they use. Some organizations perform primarily 
routine tasks that can be reduced to formal rules that require little judgment 
(such as  manufacturing auto parts), whereas others (such as consulting firms) 
work primarily with nonroutine tasks. 
3.2 
WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS ON ORGANIZATIONS?
Information systems have become integral, online, interactive tools deeply 
involved in the minute-to-minute operations and decision making of large 
organizations. Over the last decade, information systems have fundamentally 
altered the economics of organizations and greatly increased the possibilities 
for organizing work. Theories and concepts from economics and sociology help 
us understand the changes brought about by IT.
ECONOMIC IMPACTS
From the point of view of economics, IT changes both the relative costs of 
capital and the costs of information. Information systems technology can be 
viewed as a factor of production that can be substituted for traditional capital 
and labor. As the cost of information technology decreases, it is substituted for 
labor, which historically has been a rising cost. Hence, information technol-
ogy should result in a decline in the number of middle managers and clerical 
 workers as information technology substitutes for their labor. 
As the cost of information technology decreases, it also substitutes for other 
forms of capital such as buildings and machinery, which remain relatively 
expensive. Hence, over time we should expect managers to increase their invest-
ments in IT because of its declining cost relative to other capital investments.
IT also affects the cost and quality of information and changes the econom-
ics of information. Information technology helps firms contract in size because 
it can reduce transaction costs—the costs incurred when a firm buys on the 
marketplace what it cannot make itself. According to transaction cost theory, 
firms and individuals seek to economize on transaction costs, much as they 
do on production costs. Using markets is expensive because of costs such as 
 locating and communicating with distant suppliers, monitoring  contract compli-
ance, buying insurance, obtaining information on products, and so forth (Coase, 
1937; Williamson, 1985). Traditionally, firms have tried to reduce  transaction 
costs through vertical integration, by getting bigger, hiring more employees, 
and buying their own suppliers and distributors, as both General Motors and 
Ford used to do.
Information technology, especially the use of networks, can help firms lower 
the cost of market participation (transaction costs), making it worthwhile for 
 
Chapter 3 Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy 
121

firms to contract with external suppliers instead of using internal sources. As 
a result, firms can shrink in size (numbers of employees) because it is far less 
expensive to outsource work to a competitive marketplace rather than hire 
employees.
For instance, by using computer links to external suppliers, auto makers 
such as Chrysler, Toyota, and Honda can achieve economies by obtaining more 
than 70 percent of their parts from the outside. Information systems make it 
possible for companies such as Cisco Systems and Dell Inc. to  outsource their 
production to contract manufacturers such as Flextronics instead of making 
their products themselves. 
As transaction costs decrease, firm size (the number of employees) should 
shrink because it becomes easier and cheaper for the firm to contract for the 
purchase of goods and services in the marketplace rather than to make the 
product or offer the service itself. Firm size can stay constant or contract even 
as the company increases its revenues. For example, when Eastman Chemical 
Company split off from Kodak in 1994, it had $3.3 billion in revenue and 24,000 
full-time employees. In 2013, it generated over $9.3 billion in revenue with only 
14,000 employees. 
Information technology also can reduce internal management costs. 
According to agency theory, the firm is viewed as a “nexus of contracts” among 
self-interested individuals rather than as a unified, profit-maximizing entity 
(Jensen and Meckling, 1976). A principal (owner) employs “agents” (employ-
ees) to perform work on his or her behalf. However, agents need  constant super-
vision and management; otherwise, they will tend to pursue their own interests 
rather than those of the owners. As firms grow in size and scope, agency costs 
or coordination costs rise because owners must expend more and more effort 
supervising and managing employees.
Information technology, by reducing the costs of acquiring and analyzing 
information, permits organizations to reduce agency costs because it becomes 
easier for managers to oversee a greater number of employees. By reducing 
overall management costs, information technology enables firms to increase 
revenues while shrinking the number of middle managers and clerical  workers. 
We have seen examples in earlier chapters where information technology 
expanded the power and scope of small organizations by enabling them to 
perform coordinating activities such as processing orders or keeping track of 
inventory with very few clerks and managers.
Because IT reduces both agency and transaction costs for firms, we should 
expect firm size to shrink over time as more capital is invested in IT. Firms 
should have fewer managers, and we expect to see revenue per employee 
increase over time.
ORGANIZATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL IMPACTS
Theories based in the sociology of complex organizations also provide some 
understanding about how and why firms change with the implementation of 
new IT applications. 
IT Flattens Organizations 
Large, bureaucratic organizations, which primarily developed before the  computer 
age, are often inefficient, slow to change, and less competitive than newly 
 created organizations. Some of these large organizations have downsized, reduc-
ing the number of employees and the number of levels in their organizational 
hierarchies. 
122 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

Behavioral researchers have theorized that information technology 
 facilitates flattening of hierarchies by broadening the distribution of 
 information to empower lower-level employees and increase management 
efficiency (see Figure 3.6). IT pushes decision-making rights lower in the 
organization because lower-level employees receive the information they 
need to make decisions without supervision. (This empowerment is also 
possible because of higher educational levels among the workforce, which 
give employees the capabilities to make intelligent decisions.) Because 
managers now receive so much more accurate information on time, they 
become much faster at making decisions, so fewer managers are required. 
Management costs decline as a percentage of revenues, and the hierarchy 
becomes much more efficient.
These changes mean that the management span of control has also been 
broadened, enabling high-level managers to manage and control more workers 
spread over greater distances. Many companies have eliminated thousands of 
middle managers as a result of these changes. 
Postindustrial Organizations 
Postindustrial theories based more on history and sociology than economics 
also support the notion that IT should flatten hierarchies. In postindustrial 
societies, authority increasingly relies on knowledge and competence, and not 
merely on formal positions. Hence, the shape of organizations flattens because 
 professional workers tend to be self-managing, and decision making should 
become more decentralized as knowledge and information become more 
 widespread throughout the firm (Drucker, 1988). 
 FIGURE 3.6  FLATTENING ORGANIZATIONS
Information systems can reduce the number of levels in an organization by providing managers 
with information to supervise larger numbers of workers and by giving lower-level employees more 
decision-making authority.
 
Chapter 3 Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy 
123

Information technology may encourage task force-networked organizations 
in which groups of professionals come together—face to face or electronically—
for short periods of time to accomplish a specific task (e.g., designing a new 
automobile); once the task is accomplished, the individuals join other task 
forces. The global consulting service Accenture is an example. Many of its 
293,000 employees move from location to location to work on projects at client 
locations in more than 56 different countries. 
Who makes sure that self-managed teams do not head off in the wrong 
direction? Who decides which person works on which team and for how 
long? How can managers evaluate the performance of someone who is 
 constantly rotating from team to team? How do people know where their 
careers are headed? New approaches for evaluating, organizing, and 
 informing workers are required, and not all companies can make virtual 
work effective.
Understanding Organizational Resistance to Change
Information systems inevitably become bound up in organizational  politics 
because they influence access to a key resource—namely, information. 
Information systems can affect who does what to whom, when, where, and 
how in an organization. Many new information systems require changes in 
 personal, individual routines that can be painful for those involved and require 
retraining and additional effort that may or may not be compensated. Because 
information systems potentially change an organization’s structure, culture, 
business processes, and strategy, there is often considerable resistance to them 
when they are introduced.
There are several ways to visualize organizational resistance. Research on 
organizational resistance to innovation suggests that four factors are 
 paramount: the nature of the IT innovation, the organization’s structure, the 
culture of people in the organization, and the tasks impacted by the innova-
tion (see Figure 3.7). Here, changes in technology are absorbed, interpreted, 
deflected, and defeated by organizational task arrangements, structures, and 
people. In this model, the only way to bring about change is to change the 
technology, tasks, structure, and people simultaneously. Other authors have 
spoken about the need to “unfreeze” organizations before  introducing an 
 innovation, quickly implementing it, and “refreezing” or institutionalizing the 
change (Kolb, 1970).
Because organizational resistance to change is so powerful, many informa-
tion technology investments flounder and do not increase productivity. Indeed, 
research on project implementation failures demonstrates that the most 
 common reason for failure of large projects to reach their objectives is not the 
failure of the technology, but organizational and political resistance to change. 
Chapter 14 treats this issue in detail. Therefore, as a manger involved in future 
IT investments, your ability to work with people and organizations is just as 
important as your technical awareness and knowledge. 
THE INTERNET AND ORGANIZATIONS
The Internet, especially the World Wide Web, has an important impact on the rela-
tionships between many firms and external entities, and even on the  organization 
of business processes inside a firm. The Internet increases the accessibility, 
storage, and distribution of information and knowledge for  organizations. In 
essence, the Internet is capable of dramatically lowering the  transaction and 
agency costs facing most organizations. For instance,  brokerage firms and banks 
124 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

in New York can now deliver their internal  operating  procedures manuals to 
their employees at distant locations by posting them on the corporate Web site, 
saving millions of dollars in distribution costs. A global sales force can receive 
nearly instant product price information updates using the Web or instructions 
from management sent by e-mail or text messaging on smartphones or mobile 
laptops. Vendors of some large retailers can access retailers’ internal Web sites 
directly to find  up-to-the-minute sales information and to initiate replenishment 
orders instantly.
Businesses are rapidly rebuilding some of their key business processes based 
on Internet technology and making this technology a key component of their IT 
infrastructures. If prior networking is any guide, one result will be simpler  business 
processes, fewer employees, and much flatter organizations than in the past.
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DESIGN AND 
UNDERSTANDING OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS
To deliver genuine benefits, information systems must be built with a clear 
understanding of the organization in which they will be used. In our experience, 
the central organizational factors to consider when planning a new system are 
the following:
• The environment in which the organization must function
• The structure of the organization: hierarchy, specialization, routines, and 
business processes 
• The organization’s culture and politics
• The type of organization and its style of leadership

• The principal interest groups affected by the system and the attitudes of

system is designed to assist

HOW DO PORTER’S COMPETITIVE FORCES 
MODEL, THE VALUE CHAIN MODEL, SYNERGIES, 
CORE COMPETENCIES, AND NETWORK 
ECONOMICS HELP COMPANIES DEVELOP 
COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES USING INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS?
In almost every industry you examine, you will find some firms do better than 
most others. There’s almost always a stand-out firm. In the automotive  industry, 
Toyota is considered a superior performer. In pure online retail, Amazon is the 
leader; in off-line retail, Walmart, the largest retailer on earth, is the leader. 
In online music, Apple’s iTunes is considered the leader with more than 60 
percent of the downloaded music market and in the related  industry of digital 
music players, the iPod is the leader. In Web search, Google is  considered the 
leader.
Firms that “do better” than others are said to have a competitive  advantage 
over others: They either have access to special resources that others do not, or 
they are able to use commonly available resources more efficiently— usually 
because of superior knowledge and information assets. In any event, they 
do better in terms of revenue growth, profitability, or productivity growth 
( efficiency), all of which ultimately in the long run translate into higher stock 
market valuations than their competitors.
But why do some firms do better than others and how do they achieve 
 competitive advantage? How can you analyze a business and identify its 
 strategic advantages? How can you develop a strategic advantage for your 
own  business? And how do information systems contribute to strategic advan-
tages? One answer to that question is Michael Porter’s competitive forces 
model. 
PORTER’S COMPETITIVE FORCES MODEL
Arguably, the most widely used model for understanding competitive  advantage 
is Michael Porter’s competitive forces model (see Figure 3.8). This model 
 provides a general view of the firm, its competitors, and the firm’s environment. 
Earlier in this chapter, we described the importance of a firm’s  environment 
and the dependence of firms on environments. Porter’s model is all about the 
firm’s general business environment. In this model, five competitive forces 
shape the fate of the firm.
Traditional Competitors
All firms share market space with other competitors who are continuously 
devising new, more efficient ways to produce by introducing new products and 
services, and attempting to attract customers by developing their brands and 
imposing switching costs on their customers. 
126 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

New Market Entrants
In a free economy with mobile labor and financial resources, new compa-
nies are always entering the marketplace. In some industries, there are very 
low  barriers to entry, whereas in other industries, entry is very difficult. For 
instance, it is fairly easy to start a pizza business or just about any small retail 
business, but it is much more expensive and difficult to enter the computer 
chip business, which has very high capital costs and requires significant exper-
tise and knowledge that is hard to obtain. New companies have several possible 
advantages: They are not locked into old plants and equipment, they often hire 
younger workers who are less expensive and perhaps more innovative, they 
are not encumbered by old worn-out brand names, and they are “more hungry” 
(more highly motivated) than traditional occupants of an industry. These 
advantages are also their weakness: They depend on outside financing for new 
plants and equipment, which can be expensive; they have a less-experienced 
workforce; and they have little brand recognition. 
Substitute Products and Services
In just about every industry, there are substitutes that your customers might 
use if your prices become too high. New technologies create new substitutes 
all the time. Ethanol can substitute for gasoline in cars; vegetable oil for diesel 
fuel in trucks; and wind, solar, coal, and hydro power for industrial electricity 
generation. Likewise, Internet and wireless telephone service can substitute 
for traditional telephone service. And, of course, an Internet music  service that 
allows you to download music tracks to an iPod or smartphone has become a 
substitute for CD-based music stores. The more substitute products and  services 
in your industry, the less you can control pricing and the lower your profit 
margins. 
Customers
A profitable company depends in large measure on its ability to attract and retain 
customers (while denying them to competitors), and charge high prices. The 
power of customers grows if they can easily switch to a competitor’s  products and 
services, or if they can force a business and its competitors to compete on price 
alone in a transparent marketplace where there is little product differentiation, 
 FIGURE 3.8 
PORTER’S COMPETITIVE FORCES MODEL
In Porter’s competitive forces model, the strategic position of the firm and its strategies are determined 
not only by competition with its traditional direct competitors but also by four other forces in the 
industry’s environment: new market entrants, substitute products, customers, and suppliers.
 
Chapter 3 Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy 
127

and all prices are known instantly (such as on the Internet). For instance, in 
the used college textbook market on the Internet, students (customers) can find 
multiple suppliers of just about any current college textbook. In this case, online 
customers have extraordinary power over used-book firms. 
Suppliers
The market power of suppliers can have a significant impact on firm profits, 
especially when the firm cannot raise prices as fast as can suppliers. The more 
different suppliers a firm has, the greater control it can exercise over suppliers 
in terms of price, quality, and delivery schedules. For instance, manufacturers 
of laptop PCs almost always have multiple competing suppliers of key 
 components, such as keyboards, hard drives, and display screens. 
INFORMATION SYSTEM STRATEGIES FOR DEALING 
WITH COMPETITIVE FORCES
What is a firm to do when it is faced with all these competitive forces? And how 
can the firm use information systems to counteract some of these forces? How 
do you prevent substitutes and inhibit new market entrants? There are four 
generic strategies, each of which often is enabled by using information technol-
ogy and systems: low-cost leadership, product differentiation, focus on market 
niche, and strengthening customer and supplier intimacy.
Low-Cost Leadership
Use information systems to achieve the lowest operational costs and the lowest 
prices. The classic example is Walmart. By keeping prices low and shelves well 
stocked using a legendary inventory replenishment system, Walmart became 
the leading retail business in the United States. Walmart’s continuous replenish-
ment system sends orders for new merchandise directly to suppliers as soon as 
consumers pay for their purchases at the cash register. Point-of-sale terminals 
record the bar code of each item passing the checkout counter and send a 
Supermarkets and 
large retail stores 
such as Walmart use 
sales data captured at 
the checkout counter 
to determine which 
items have sold and 
need to be reordered. 
Walmart’s continuous 
replenishment system 
transmits orders to 
restock directly to its 
suppliers. The system 
enables Walmart to 
keep costs low while 
fine-tuning its 
 merchandise to meet 
customer demands.

 purchase transaction directly to a central computer at Walmart headquarters. 
The computer collects the orders from all Walmart stores and transmits them to 
 suppliers. Suppliers can also access Walmart’s sales and inventory data using 
Web technology. 
Because the system replenishes inventory with lightning speed, Walmart 
does not need to spend much money on maintaining large inventories of 
goods in its own warehouses. The system also enables Walmart to adjust 
 purchases of store items to meet customer demands. Competitors, such as 
Sears, have been spending 24.9 percent of sales on overhead. But by using 
systems to keep operating costs low, Walmart pays only 16.6 percent of sales 
revenue for overhead. (Operating costs average 20.7 percent of sales in the 
retail industry.)
Walmart’s continuous replenishment system is also an example of an 
 efficient customer response system. An efficient customer response system 
directly links consumer behavior to distribution and production and supply 
chains. Walmart’s continuous replenishment system provides such an efficient 
customer response.
Product Differentiation
Use information systems to enable new products and services, or greatly 
change the customer convenience in using your existing products and  services. 
For instance, Google continuously introduces new and unique search services 
on its Web site, such as Google Maps. By purchasing PayPal, an electronic pay-
ment system, in 2003, eBay made it much easier for customers to pay sellers 
and expanded use of its auction marketplace. Apple created the iPod, a unique 
portable digital music player, plus a unique online Web music service where 
songs can be purchased for $.69 to $1.29 each. Apple has continued to innovate 
with its multimedia iPhone, iPad tablet computer, and iPod video player. 
Manufacturers and retailers are using information systems to create products 
and services that are customized and personalized to fit the precise specifications 
of individual customers. For example, Nike sells customized sneakers through its 
NIKEiD program on its Web site. Customers are able to select the type of shoe, 
colors, material, outsoles, and even a logo of up to eight characters. Nike trans-
mits the orders via computers to specially equipped plants in China and Korea. 
The sneakers take about three weeks to reach the customer. This ability to offer 
individually tailored products or services using the same production resources as 
mass production is called mass customization.
In addition to all of the usual bells and whistles, automakers are using tech-
nology in other ways to distinguish their products. The Interactive Session on 
Technology describes some many of the new technology-based products and 
services offered by car companies.
Table 3.3 lists a number of companies that have developed IT-based products 
and services that other firms have found difficult to copy, or at least a long time 
to copy. 
Focus on Market Niche
Use information systems to enable a specific market focus, and serve this 
narrow target market better than competitors. Information systems  support 
this strategy by producing and analyzing data for finely tuned sales and 
 marketing techniques. Information systems enable companies to  analyze 
 customer buying patterns, tastes, and preferences closely so that they 
 efficiently pitch advertising and marketing campaigns to smaller and smaller 
target markets. 
 
Chapter 3 Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy

As the smartphone market continues to expand, 
another industry has begun getting “smarter” with 
software and apps: the automobile industry. Ford, 
BMW, and other automobile companies are enhanc-
ing their vehicles with on-board software that 
improves the customer experience, and the auto 
industry is working on technology that will allow 
cars to be managed via the cloud.
Automakers are finding that software is a way of 
adding more “value” and freshness to their products 
without having to invest so heavily in new vehicle 
production. It takes Ford Motor Company, for exam-
ple, about two and a half years to plan, design, and 
build a new car. Design and production, including 
metal stamping equipment and assembly line setup, 
must be finalized long before the car rolls off the 
line. But the auto makers can create a new software 
interface for a car within months and update it again 
and again over the life of the car without much lead 
time. This enables Ford and other auto makers to 
significantly improve the driving experience and add 
new features to cars years after they are built.
Ford is perhaps the automaker doing the most 
to innovate with software and apps. Its MyFord 
Touch interface is an in-dash touchscreen avail-
able for select vehicles with controls for navigation, 
music, phone integration, and temperature. Ford has 
upgraded this interface and the Sync software behind 
the interface, adding tablet and smartphone integra-
tion and better voice response. In 2010 Ford added 
support for the online music streaming service 
Pandora, which is very popular among young poten-
tial buyers. This update enables drivers to connect 
their tablets and smartphones to the Sync system to 
access music and other apps using voice commands.
Chairman Bill Ford Jr. has championed the use of 
software to alleviate urban congestion by investing in 
technology that responds to the problems created by 
traffic in the biggest cities. Theoretically, technology 
might help cars to avoid traffic jams, reserve parking 
spaces in advance, and even drive themselves.
To manage vehicles in this way, cars need to 
be connected to some kind of central system that 
would coordinate with public transit and other 
transportation methods, and to do this, cars need 
to be equipped with software that can monitor and 
enhance vehicle function at the most basic levels. 
The eventual system would require that cars feed 
increasing amounts of information to systems whose 
purpose would be to minimize highway congestion. 
The system would also require an industry standard, 
which does not exist as of yet. Ford has doubled its 
investment in vehicle-to-vehicle communication 
technologies and BMW is also continuing to develop 
ways for vehicles to communicate with one another 
on the road to avoid collisions.
With the inclusion of software in their cars, auto-
makers are entering uncharted territory. They must 
now devote resources to updating and testing their 
software, as well as establishing ways to provide the 
updated software to their customers. Car companies 
need to coordinate their car development cycles 
more closely with their software development cycles. 
Also, many of the technologies included in automo-
bile software packages raise the same privacy con-
cerns surrounding location tracking that have often 
plagued smartphone manufacturers and app develop-
ers.
Ford is grappling with the best way to roll out soft-
ware upgrades to its customers. The company has 
been mailing USB sticks to 250,000 customers whose 
cars have an advanced touchscreen control panel 
running the MyFord Touch interface. The stick con-
tains a software upgrade that will improve navigation 
controls, the music and phone features, as well as 
the ability to control car temperature. The upgrade 
also contains code that will upgrade system speed 
and improve the interface based on common criti-
cisms from Ford owners.
Although Ford says it plans to continue issuing 
software upgrades this way, the company hopes that 
customers will get into the habit of checking the Ford 
Web site for software upgrades on their own. Though 
most car owners are used to the technology in their 
cars remaining constant throughout the life of the 
car, newer cars are poised to change all of that.
Ford has hired “human–machine interface engi-
neers,” whose job is to analyze how their customers 
interact with the software in their cars. Often, these 
engineers use customer feedback to make changes to 
the software. Customers complained that too much 
information was available on each screen of the 
interface, so Ford moved the most commonly used 
features to more prominent positions on screen and 
increased their font size, relegating the rest to sub-
menus. Feedback has been positive. Ford has also 
asked dealers to dedicate more time and personnel to

GM, Daimler, and other companies are all devel-
oping new features for their cars that operate online 
in the cloud. Users will be able to remotely track 
their cars (you’ll never forget where you parked 
again) and diagnose problems with the car, such 
as low tire pressure or the need for an oil change. 
Corporations will be able to track employee use of 
company cars by interpreting car sensors and engine 
readouts. Manufacturers will be able to aggregate 
and analyze the data from customers’ cars to identify 
quality problems and, if necessary, quickly issue 
recalls. Just as with apps, the possibilities are limited 
only by the imagination of automakers.
GM will allow its app developers to access its com-
puter systems to improve app function, which raises 
a familiar set of privacy concerns. Auto analysts 
believe that automakers will make mistakes as they 
learn how to properly handle sensitive customer data 
and to provide robust privacy options. On the other 
hand, automakers are hoping that younger customers

who have grown up using Facebook are less likely to 
care about privacy and features that collect highly 
targeted information about a car’s location and driv-
ing habits.
BMW is also investing a whopping $100 million 
in mobile apps, hoping to market them to their cus-
tomers as “premium services.” Some analysts are 
skeptical of the decision to invest that much money, 
but BMW believes that mobile apps will become an 
increasingly attractive selling point for customers 
of its BMWi electric and hybrid cars. Although the 
future of cars sharing information with other nearby 
cars is still years away, automakers are excited by the 
possibilities afforded by smart software and apps.

infer rules from them to guide decision making. Analysis of such data drives 
one-to-one marketing that creates personal messages based on individualized 
preferences. For example, Hilton Hotels’ OnQ system analyzes detailed data 
collected on active guests in all of its properties to determine the preferences 
of each guest and each guest’s profitability. Hilton uses this information to 
give its most profitable customers additional privileges, such as late checkouts. 
Contemporary customer relationship management (CRM) systems feature ana-
lytical capabilities for this type of intensive data analysis (see Chapters 2 and 
9). The Interactive Session on Organizations provides more examples of how 
companies are benefiting from this fine-grained data analysis.
Credit card companies are able to use this strategy to predict their most 
 profitable cardholders. The companies gather vast quantities of data about 
 consumer purchases and other behaviors and mine these data to construct 
detailed profiles that identify cardholders who might be good or bad credit risks. 
We discuss the tools and technologies for data analysis in Chapters 6 and 12.
Strengthen Customer and Supplier Intimacy
Use information systems to tighten linkages with suppliers and develop  intimacy 
with customers. Chrysler Corporation uses information systems to facilitate 
direct access by suppliers to production schedules, and even permits  suppliers 
to decide how and when to ship supplies to Chrysler factories. This allows 
 suppliers more lead time in producing goods. On the customer side, Amazon 
keeps track of user preferences for book and CD purchases, and can recommend 
titles purchased by others to its customers. Strong linkages to customers and 
suppliers increase switching costs (the cost of switching from one product to a 
competing product), and loyalty to your firm.
Table 3.4 summarizes the competitive strategies we have just described. 
Some companies focus on one of these strategies, but you will often see 
 companies pursuing several of them simultaneously. For example, Starbucks, 
the world’s largest specialty coffee retailer, offers unique high-end specialty 
coffees and beverages, but is also trying to compete by lowering costs.

With the amount of data available to companies dou-
bling every year, new sources of data, and innova-
tions in data collection, possibilities for  marketers to 
identify market niches and finely tune campaigns 
are boundless. In the e-book market, for example, 
three reading subscription service startups—Scribd, 
Oyster, and Entitle—aim to turn a profit by discover-
ing exactly what makes readers tick.
A flat monthly fee gives users unlimited access 
to a broad selection of titles from these companies’ 
 digital libraries. Like Barnes and Noble and Amazon, 
the newcomers will collect an assortment of data from 
their customers’ digital reading devices (e-readers, 
tablets, smartphones), including whether a book is 
completed, if pages are skimmed or skipped, and 
which genres are most often finished. These subscrip-
tion services intend to disseminate what they have 
learned. The idea is that writers can use it to better 
tailor their work to their readership, and book editors 
can use it to choose which manuscripts to publish.
When customers sign up with these services, they 
are informed that some of their data will be col-
lected and used but assured that their identities will 
be  protected. Large independent publisher Smash 
words is enthusiastic about the value of such data to 
the authors who use its platform to self-publish and 
 distribute their work. Many contemporary authors 
have already explored the feedback opportunities 
available through their own Web sites, social net-
working sites, and Goodreads, a user-populated data-
base of books, annotations, and reviews now owned 
by Amazon. The subscription services will take this 
type of  market research to a more quantifiable level.
Preliminary data analysis has already revealed 
that as the length of a mystery novel increases so 
does the likelihood that a reader will skip to the end 
to discover the resolution. Business books are less 
likely to be finished than biographies, most readers 
complete just a single chapter of a yoga book, and 
some of the quickest reading is recorded for romance 
novels, with erotica leading the pack. Shorter 
 chapters entice readers on e-readers, tablets, and 
smartphones to finish a book 25 percent more often 
than books with long chapters.
But does book completion translate to book sales? 
And how will this knowledge impact the  creative 
process? Will quality be negatively impacted to 
satisfy reader preferences? Before any of these 
 questions can be answered, authors will need 
access to comprehensive data. And that depends 
on the large publishing houses signing deals with 
the  subscription services. After nearly two decades 
of market disruptions spearheaded by Amazon, 
publishers are not flocking to supply titles. So far, 
only Harper Collins has signed with Oyster and 
Scribd, while Random House, Penguin, and Simon & 
Schuster remain on the sidelines.
In the airline industry, nearly all carriers collect 
passenger data, but some are aggressively pursuing 
data mining to personalize the flying experience. 
Previously unlinked data sets can now be consoli-
dated to build comprehensive customer profiles. 
Cabin crews equipped with tablets or smartphones 
can identify the top five customers on the plane, 
passengers with special diets or allergies, seat 
 preferences, newlyweds embarking on their honey-
moon, and customers whose luggage was misplaced 
or who experienced flight delays on their previous 
flights. In-flight browsing history and Facebook likes 
are even used to fashion relevant marketing pitches.
This “captive audience” aspect of air travel in 
 conjunction with the sheer volume of information 
 airlines collect presents a unique opportunity to 
 marketers. Allegiant Travel company has already been 
able to sell show tickets, car rentals, and helicopter 
tours to Las Vegas travelers. United Airlines’ revamp 
of its Web site, kiosks, and mobile app, along with its 
data  integration initiative, have enabled it to target fly-
ers predisposed to upgrading to an economy plus seat.
Not all customers are pleased. A user on Delta’s 
FlyerTalk forum complained that a link from the 
new DL.com Web site led to a personal profile that 
included a lot more than her miles accumulated 
and home airport. Annual income, home value, 
and the age ranges of her children were included 
along with expected data such as amount spent on 
airfare, hotel preference, and type of credit card. 
The resulting negative publicity prompted Delta to 
apologize, but it defended its use of demographic 
data and data not covered under its privacy policy. 
Credit-card partner American Express had  supplied 
some data, as allowed under the policy. Global 
 information  services group Experian supplied the 
rest,  unbeknownst to consumers. 
These data-driven marketing approaches are not 
flawless. Even customers who accept the inevitability

of profiling are miffed when they receive  unsuitable 
offers based on faulty personal information. A 
Qantas survey of frequent fliers found that most 
 customers want a line drawn between data  collection 
to facilitate useful offers and data collection that is 
too intrusive. British Airways crossed the line with 
its “Know Me” program. Google Image searches 
were used to identify VIP customers as they entered 
the airport and first class lounge. The practice has 
since been discontinued. Customers can opt out of 
British Airways personalization services—but not its 
data collection. Upon request, a note is added to the 
 customer profile, which nonetheless continues to 
grow. None of the carriers currently allow customers 
to opt out of their data programs.
As car companies explore their Big Data 
 opportunities, customer privacy will become an 
issue for them as well. Ford Motor Company began 
 exploring how integrating databases and using 
complex algorithms could lead to increased sales 
three years ago when it developed a program for 
its dealerships to more closely match car lot inven-
tory to buyer demand. Using buying trends, local 
and national vehicle supply, and current car lot 
 inventory, Ford devised a program to make purchas-
ing recommendations to dealers. Not only did vehi-
cle turnover rate improve, but net price—the price 
a consumer pays minus the manufacturer subsidy—
rose, fueling an upturn in Ford’s profits.
But Ford is thinking even bigger. Performance

safety and performance metrics could soon be 
used to improve product engineering. What’s more, 
onboard connections can be used to message drivers 
about potential breakdown issues, perhaps heading 
off an expensive recall. Since Ford estimates that by 
2016, up to a third of all its consumer communica-
tion will occur inside vehicles, possibilities abound. 
Leased vehicle usage data could inform end-of-lease 
marketing pitches; driving pattern, schedule, and 
driving maneuver data could suggest routes most 
compatible to a driver’s habits; car location data 
could be sent to traffic management systems to 
 control stop lights; data from networked cars could 
alert other drivers to hazardous conditions and traffic 
jams, and current car value and payment data can 
advise drivers of their optimal trade-in date.
It’s not hard to foresee the privacy issues that 
could come into play as drivers realize that not only 
their location, but their every movement inside their 
vehicle is being tracked. There are implications for 
law enforcement—traffic tickets and accident blame 
attribution. Balancing privacy dilemmas with conve-
nience, security, and expediency of transactions will 
be the challenge going forward for all companies as 
they explore emerging big data analysis capabilities.

 technology is based on universal standards that any company can use, making 
it easy for rivals to compete on price alone and for new competitors to enter the 
market. Because information is available to everyone, the Internet raises the 
bargaining power of customers, who can quickly find the lowest-cost  provider 
on the Web. Profits have been dampened. Table 3.5 summarizes some of the 
potentially  negative impacts of the Internet on business firms identified by 
Porter.

Substitute products or services
Enables new substitutes to emerge with new approaches to meeting needs and performing functions
Customers’ bargaining power
Availability of global price and product information shifts bargaining power to customers
Suppliers’ bargaining power
Procurement over the Internet tends to raise bargaining power over suppliers; suppliers can also benefit 
from reduced barriers to entry and from the elimination of distributors and other intermediaries standing 
between them and their users
Threat of new entrants
Internet reduces barriers to entry, such as the need for a sales force, access to channels, and physical 
assets; it provides a technology for driving business processes that makes other things easier to do
Positioning and rivalry among 
existing competitors
Widens the geographic market, increasing the number of competitors, and reducing differences among 
competitors; makes it more difficult to sustain operational advantages; puts pressure to compete on price
The Internet has nearly destroyed some industries and has severely 
 threatened more. For instance, the printed encyclopedia industry and the travel 
agency industry have been nearly decimated by the availability of  substitutes 
over the Internet. Likewise, the Internet has had a significant impact on 
the retail, music, book, retail brokerage, software, telecommunications, and 
 newspaper industries.
However, the Internet has also created entirely new markets, formed the basis 
for thousands of new products, services, and business models, and  provided 
new opportunities for building brands with very large and loyal customer 
bases. Amazon, eBay, iTunes, YouTube, Facebook, Travelocity, and Google are 
 examples. In this sense, the Internet is “transforming” entire  industries, forcing 
firms to change how they do business.
For most forms of media, the Internet has posed a threat to business models 
and profitability. Growth in book sales other than textbooks and professional 
publications has been sluggish, as new forms of entertainment continue to 
compete for consumers’ time. Newspapers and magazines have been hit even 
harder, as their readerships diminish, their advertisers shrink, and more people 
get their news for free online. The television and film industries have been 
forced to deal with pirates who are robbing them of some of their profits, as well 
as with online services streaming videos and TV shows.
THE BUSINESS VALUE CHAIN MODEL
Although the Porter model is very helpful for identifying competitive forces 
and suggesting generic strategies, it is not very specific about what exactly to 
do, and it does not provide a methodology to follow for achieving competi-
tive advantages. If your goal is to achieve operational excellence, where do you 
start? Here’s where the business value chain model is helpful. 
The value chain model highlights specific activities in the business where 
competitive strategies can best be applied (Porter, 1985) and where informa-
tion systems are most likely to have a strategic impact. This model identifies 
specific, critical leverage points where a firm can use information technology 
most effectively to enhance its competitive position. The value chain model 
views the firm as a series or chain of basic activities that add a margin of 
 
Chapter 3 Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy 
135

value to a firm’s products or services. These activities can be categorized as 
either primary activities or support activities (see Figure 3.9).
Primary activities are most directly related to the production and 
 distribution of the firm’s products and services, which create value for the 
 customer. Primary activities include inbound logistics, operations, outbound 
logistics, sales and marketing, and service. Inbound logistics includes  receiving 
and  storing materials for distribution to production. Operations transforms 
inputs into finished products. Outbound logistics entails storing and distribut-
ing  finished products. Sales and marketing includes promoting and selling the 
firm’s  products. The service activity includes maintenance and repair of the 
firm’s goods and services. 
Support activities make the delivery of the primary activities possible 
and consist of organization infrastructure (administration and management), 
human resources (employee recruiting, hiring, and training), technology 
(improving products and the production process), and procurement (purchas-
ing input).
Now you can ask at each stage of the value chain, “How can we use  information 
systems to improve operational efficiency, and improve customer and  supplier 
intimacy?” This will force you to critically examine how you  perform value- 
adding activities at each stage and how the business processes might be 
improved. You can also begin to ask how information systems can be used to 
improve the relationship with customers and with suppliers who lie outside the 
firm’s value chain but belong to the firm’s extended value chain where they are 
 FIGURE 3.9 
THE VALUE CHAIN MODEL

value partners that can add a margin of value to a firm’s products or services.

 absolutely critical to your success. Here, supply chain management systems 
that  coordinate the flow of resources into your firm, and customer relationship 
management systems that coordinate your sales and support employees with 
customers, are two of the most common system applications that result from a 
business value chain analysis. We discuss these enterprise applications in detail 
later in Chapter 9.
Using the business value chain model will also cause you to consider 
 benchmarking your business processes against your competitors or others in 
related industries, and identifying industry best practices. Benchmarking 
involves comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of your business  processes 
against strict standards and then measuring performance against those 
 standards. Industry best practices are usually identified by consulting compa-
nies, research organizations, government agencies, and industry associations as 
the most successful solutions or problem-solving methods for consistently and 
effectively achieving a business objective.
Once you have analyzed the various stages in the value chain at your 
 business, you can come up with candidate applications of information systems. 
Then, once you have a list of candidate applications, you can decide which 
to develop first. By making improvements in your own business value chain 
that your competitors might miss, you can achieve competitive advantage by 
attaining operational excellence, lowering costs, improving profit margins, and 
forging a closer relationship with customers and suppliers. If your competitors 
are making similar improvements, then at least you will not be at a competitive 
disadvantage—the worst of all cases! 
Extending the Value Chain: The Value Web
Figure 3.9 shows that a firm’s value chain is linked to the value chains of its 
suppliers, distributors, and customers. After all, the performance of most firms 
depends not only on what goes on inside a firm but also on how well the firm 
coordinates with direct and indirect suppliers, delivery firms (logistics partners, 
such as FedEx or UPS), and, of course, customers. 
How can information systems be used to achieve strategic advantage at 
the industry level? By working with other firms, industry participants can 
use information technology to develop industry-wide standards for exchang-
ing information or business transactions electronically, which force all market 
participants to subscribe to similar standards. Such efforts increase efficiency, 
making product substitution less likely and perhaps raising entry costs—thus 
discouraging new entrants. Also, industry members can build industry-wide, 
IT-supported consortia, symposia, and communications networks to coordinate 
activities concerning government agencies, foreign competition, and compet-
ing industries. 
Looking at the industry value chain encourages you to think about how 
to use information systems to link up more efficiently with your suppliers, 
 strategic partners, and customers. Strategic advantage derives from your abil-
ity to relate your value chain to the value chains of other partners in the pro-
cess. For instance, if you are Amazon.com, you want to build systems that:
• Make it easy for suppliers to display goods and open stores on the Amazon 
site
• Make it easy for customers to pay for goods
• Develop systems that coordinate the shipment of goods to customers
• Develop shipment tracking systems for customers
 
Chapter 3 Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy 
137

Internet technology has made it possible to create highly synchronized 
 industry value chains called value webs. A value web is a collection of 
independent firms that use information technology to coordinate their value 
chains to produce a product or service for a market collectively. It is more 
customer driven and operates in a less linear fashion than the traditional 
value chain.
Figure 3.10 shows that this value web synchronizes the business processes 
of customers, suppliers, and trading partners among different companies in an 
industry or in related industries. These value webs are flexible and adaptive to 
changes in supply and demand. Relationships can be bundled or unbundled in 
response to changing market conditions. Firms will accelerate time to market 
and to customers by optimizing their value web relationships to make quick 
decisions on who can deliver the required products or services at the right price 
and location.
SYNERGIES, CORE COMPETENCIES, AND NETWORK-
BASED STRATEGIES 
A large corporation is typically a collection of businesses. Often, the firm is 
organized financially as a collection of strategic business units and the returns 
to the firm are directly tied to the performance of all the strategic business 
units. Information systems can improve the overall performance of these 
 business units by promoting synergies and core competencies. 
 FIGURE 3.10 THE VALUE WEB
The value web is a networked system that can synchronize the value chains of business partners 
within an industry to respond rapidly to changes in supply and demand.
138 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

Synergies
The idea of synergies is that when the output of some units can be used as 
inputs to other units, or two organizations pool markets and expertise, these 
relationships lower costs and generate profits. Recent bank and financial firm 
mergers, such as the merger of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York as well 
as Bank of America and Countrywide Financial Corporation occurred precisely 
for this purpose.
One use of information technology in these synergy situations is to tie 
together the operations of disparate business units so that they can act as a 
whole. For example, acquiring Countrywide Financial enabled Bank of America 
to extend its mortgage lending business and to tap into a large pool of new 
customers who might be interested in its credit card, consumer banking, and 
other financial products. Information systems would help the merged compa-
nies consolidate operations, lower retailing costs, and increase cross-marketing 
of financial products.
Enhancing Core Competencies
Yet another way to use information systems for competitive advantage is 
to think about ways that systems can enhance core competencies. The 
 argument is that the performance of all business units will increase insofar 
as these  business units develop, or create, a central core of competencies. A 
core  competency is an activity for which a firm is a world-class leader. Core 
 competencies may involve being the world’s best miniature parts designer, 
the best package  delivery service, or the best thin-film manufacturer. In gen-
eral, a core competency relies on knowledge that is gained over many years 
of practical field experience with a technology. This practical knowledge 
is typically supplemented with a long-term research effort and committed 
employees.
Any information system that encourages the sharing of knowledge across 
business units enhances competency. Such systems might encourage or 
enhance existing competencies and help employees become aware of new 
external knowledge; such systems might also help a business leverage existing 
competencies to related markets. 
For example, Procter & Gamble, a world leader in brand management and 
consumer product innovation, uses a series of systems to enhance its core 
 competencies. An intranet called InnovationNet helps people working on  similar 
problems share ideas and expertise. InnovationNet connects those  working in 
research and development (R&D), engineering, purchasing,  marketing, legal 
affairs, and business information systems around the world, using a portal to 
provide browser-based access to documents, reports, charts, videos, and other 
data from various sources. It includes a directory of subject matter experts who 
can be tapped to give advice or collaborate on problem solving and product 
development, and links to outside research scientists and entrepreneurs who 
are searching for new, innovative products worldwide.
Network-Based Strategies
The availability of Internet and networking technology have inspired strategies 
that take advantage of firms’ abilities to create networks or network with each 
other. Network-based strategies include the use of network economics, a virtual 
company model, and business ecosystems.
Network Economics. Business models based on a network may help firms 
strategically by taking advantage of network economics. In traditional 
 
Chapter 3 Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy 
139

 economics—the economics of factories and agriculture—production  experiences 
diminishing returns. The more any given resource is applied to production, the 
lower the marginal gain in output, until a point is reached where the additional 
inputs produce no additional outputs. This is the law of diminishing returns, 
and it is the foundation for most of modern economics.
In some situations, the law of diminishing returns does not work. For 
instance, in a network, the marginal costs of adding another participant are 
about zero, whereas the marginal gain is much larger. The larger the number 
of subscribers in a telephone system or the Internet, the greater the value 
to all participants because each user can interact with more people. It is not 
much more expensive to operate a television station with 1,000 subscribers 
than with 10 million subscribers. The value of a community of people grows 
with size, whereas the cost of adding new members is inconsequential.
From this network economics perspective, information technology can be 
strategically useful. Internet sites can be used by firms to build communities 
of users—like-minded customers who want to share their experiences. This 
builds customer loyalty and enjoyment, and builds unique ties to customers. 
EBay, the giant online auction site, and iVillage, an online community for 
women, are examples. Both businesses are based on networks of millions of 
users, and both companies have used the Web and Internet communication 
tools to build  communities. The more people offering products on eBay, the 
more  valuable the eBay site is to everyone because more products are listed, 
and more competition among suppliers lowers prices. Network economics also 
provides strategic benefits to commercial software vendors. The value of their 
software and complementary software products increases as more people use 
them, and there is a larger installed base to justify continued use of the product 
and vendor support.
Virtual Company Model. Another network-based strategy uses the model of 
a virtual company to create a competitive business. A virtual company, also 
known as a virtual organization, uses networks to link people, assets, and 
ideas, enabling it to ally with other companies to create and distribute  products 
and services without being limited by traditional organizational boundaries or 
physical locations. One company can use the capabilities of another company 
without being physically tied to that company. The virtual company model is 
useful when a company finds it cheaper to acquire products, services, or 
 capabilities from an external vendor or when it needs to move quickly to 
exploit new market opportunities and lacks the time and resources to respond 
on its own. 
Fashion companies, such as GUESS, Ann Taylor, Levi Strauss, and Reebok, 
enlist Hong Kong-based Li & Fung to manage production and shipment of their 
garments. Li & Fung handles product development, raw material sourcing, 
 production planning, quality assurance, and shipping. Li & Fung does not own 
any fabric, factories, or machines, outsourcing all of its work to a network of 
more than 15,000 suppliers in 40 countries all over the world. Customers place 
orders to Li & Fung over its private extranet. Li & Fung then sends instruc-
tions to appropriate raw material suppliers and factories where the clothing is 
 produced. The Li & Fung extranet tracks the entire production process for each 
order. Working as a virtual company keeps Li & Fung flexible and adaptable so 
that it can design and produce the products ordered by its clients in short order 
to keep pace with rapidly changing fashion trends. 
Business Ecosystems: Keystone and Niche Firms. The Internet and the 
emergence of digital firms call for some modification of the industry competi-
tive forces model. The traditional Porter model assumes a relatively static 
140 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

industry environment; relatively clear-cut industry boundaries; and a relatively 
stable set of suppliers, substitutes, and customers, with the focus on industry 
players in a market environment. Instead of participating in a single industry, 
some of today’s firms are much more aware that they participate in industry 
sets—collections of industries that provide related services and products 
(see Figure 3.11). Business ecosystem is another term for these loosely 
 coupled but interdependent networks of suppliers, distributors, outsourcing 
firms, transportation service firms, and technology manufacturers (Iansiti and 
Levien, 2004). 
The concept of a business ecosystem builds on the idea of the value web 
described earlier, the main difference being that cooperation takes place across 
many industries rather than many firms. For instance, both Microsoft and 
Walmart provide platforms composed of information systems, technolo-
gies, and services that thousands of other firms in different industries use 
to enhance their own capabilities. Microsoft has estimated that more than 
40,000 firms use its Windows platform to deliver their own products, support 
Microsoft products, and extend the value of Microsoft’s own firm. Walmart’s 
order entry and inventory management system is a platform used by 
 thousands of suppliers to obtain real-time access to customer demand, track 
shipments, and control inventories. 
Business ecosystems can be characterized as having one or a few keystone 
firms that dominate the ecosystem and create the platforms used by other niche 
firms. Keystone firms in the Microsoft ecosystem include Microsoft and technol-
ogy producers such as Intel and IBM. Niche firms include thousands of software 
application firms, software developers, service firms, networking firms, and 
 consulting firms that both support and rely on the Microsoft products. 
Information technology plays a powerful role in establishing business 
 ecosystems. Obviously, many firms use information systems to develop into 
keystone firms by building IT-based platforms that other firms can use. In 
the digital firm era, we can expect greater emphasis on the use of IT to build 
 FIGURE 3.11 AN ECOSYSTEM STRATEGIC MODEL
The digital firm era requires a more dynamic view of the boundaries among industries, firms, custom-
ers, and suppliers, with competition occurring among industry sets in a business ecosystem. In the 
ecosystem model, multiple industries work together to deliver value to the customer. IT plays an 
important role in enabling a dense network of interactions among the participating firms. 
 
Chapter 3 Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy 
141

industry ecosystems because the costs of participating in such ecosystems will 
fall and the benefits to all firms will increase rapidly as the platform grows.
Individual firms should consider how their information systems will enable 
them to become profitable niche players in larger ecosystems created by 
 keystone firms. For instance, in making decisions about which products to build 
or which services to offer, a firm should consider the existing business ecosys-
tems related to these products and how it might use IT to enable participation 
in these larger ecosystems.
A powerful, current example of a rapidly expanding ecosystem is the mobile 
Internet platform. In this ecosystem there are four industries: device makers 
(Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Motorola, LG, and others), wireless telecom-
munication firms (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and others), independent 
software applications providers (generally small firms selling games, applica-
tions, and ring tones), and Internet service providers (who participate as 
 providers of Internet service to the mobile platform).
Each of these industries has its own history, interests, and driving forces. But 
these elements come together in a sometimes cooperative, and  sometimes 
competitive, new industry we refer to as the mobile digital platform ecosystem. 
More than other firms, Apple has managed to combine these industries into a 
system. It is Apple’s mission to sell physical devices (iPhones) that are nearly 
as powerful as today’s personal computers. These devices work only with a 
high-speed broadband network supplied by the wireless phone carriers. In 
order to attract a large customer base, the iPhone had to be more than just a cell 
phone. Apple differentiated this product by making it a “smart phone,” one 
capable of running over one million different, useful applications. Apple could 
not develop all these applications itself. Instead it relies on  generally small, 
independent software developers to provide these applications, which can be 
purchased at the iTunes store. In the background is the Internet service pro-
vider industry, which makes money whenever iPhone users connect to the 
Internet.

WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES POSED BY 
STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND HOW 
SHOULD THEY BE ADDRESSED?
Strategic information systems often change the organization as well as its 
 products, services, and operating procedures, driving the organization into 
new behavioral patterns. Successfully using information systems to achieve 
a  competitive advantage is challenging and requires precise coordination of 
 technology, organizations, and management.
SUSTAINING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 
The competitive advantages that strategic systems confer do not necessarily last 
long enough to ensure long-term profitability. Because competitors can  retaliate 
and copy strategic systems, competitive advantage is not always  sustainable. 
Markets, customer expectations, and technology change;  globalization has 
made these changes even more rapid and unpredictable. The Internet can make 
competitive advantage disappear very quickly because  virtually all  companies 
can use this technology. Classic strategic systems, such as American Airlines’s 
SABRE computerized reservation system, Citibank’s ATM system, and FedEx’s 
142 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

package tracking system, benefited by being the first in their industries. Then 
rival systems emerged. Amazon was an e-commerce leader but now faces 
 competition from eBay, Yahoo, and Google. Information systems alone cannot 
provide an enduring business advantage. Systems  originally intended to be 
 strategic frequently become tools for  survival, required by every firm to stay in 
business, or they may inhibit organizations from making the strategic changes 
essential for future success.
ALIGNING IT WITH BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
The research on IT and business performance has found that (a) the more 
 successfully a firm can align information technology with its business goals, the 
more profitable it will be, and (b) only one-quarter of firms achieve  alignment 
of IT with the business. About half of a business firm’s profits can be explained 
by alignment of IT with business (Luftman, 2003).
Most businesses get it wrong: Information technology takes on a life of its own 
and does not serve management and shareholder interests very well. Instead of 
business people taking an active role in shaping IT to the  enterprise, they ignore 
it, claim not to understand IT, and tolerate failure in the IT area as just a nuisance 
to work around. Such firms pay a hefty price in poor  performance. Successful 
firms and managers understand what IT can do and how it works, take an active 
role in shaping its use, and measure its impact on revenues and profits.
Management Checklist: Performing a Strategic 
Systems Analysis
To align IT with the business and use information systems effectively for 
 competitive advantage, managers need to perform a strategic systems  analysis. 
To identify the types of systems that provide a strategic advantage to their firms, 
managers should ask the following questions: 
1. What is the structure of the industry in which the firm is located? 
• What are some of the competitive forces at work in the industry? Are there 
new entrants to the industry? What is the relative power of suppliers, 
 customers, and substitute products and services over prices? 
• Is the basis of competition quality, price, or brand?
• What are the direction and nature of change within the industry? 
From where are the momentum and change coming?
• How is the industry currently using information technology? Is the 
 organization behind or ahead of the industry in its application of information 
systems?
2. What are the business, firm, and industry value chains for this particular firm?
• How is the company creating value for the customer—through lower prices 
and transaction costs or higher quality? Are there any places in the value 
chain where the business could create more value for the customer and 
 additional profit for the company? 
• Does the firm understand and manage its business processes using the 
best practices available? Is it taking maximum advantage of supply chain 
 management, customer relationship management, and enterprise systems?
• Does the firm leverage its core competencies?
• Is the industry supply chain and customer base changing in ways that 
 benefit or harm the firm?
• Can the firm benefit from strategic partnerships and value webs?
 
Chapter 3 Information Systems, Organizations, and Strategy 
143

• Where in the value chain will information systems provide the greatest value 
to the firm?
3. Have we aligned IT with our business strategy and goals?
• Have we correctly articulated our business strategy and goals?
• Is IT improving the right business processes and activities to promote this 
strategy?
• Are we using the right metrics to measure progress toward those goals?
MANAGING STRATEGIC TRANSITIONS
Adopting the kinds of strategic systems described in this chapter generally 
requires changes in business goals, relationships with customers and  suppliers, 
and business processes. These sociotechnical changes, affecting both social 
and technical elements of the organization, can be considered strategic transi-
tions—a movement between levels of sociotechnical systems.
Such changes often entail blurring of organizational boundaries, both external 
and internal. Suppliers and customers must become intimately linked and may 
share each other’s responsibilities. Managers will need to devise new business 
processes for coordinating their firms’ activities with those of customers, suppli-
ers, and other organizations. The organizational change requirements surround-
ing new information systems are so important that they merit attention through-
out this text. Chapter 14 examines organizational change issues in more detail.
Review Summary
1. Which features of organizations do managers need to know about to build and use information  systems 
successfully?
All modern organizations are hierarchical, specialized, and impartial, using explicit routines to 
maximize efficiency. All organizations have their own cultures and politics arising from differences 
in interest groups, and they are affected by their surrounding environment. Organizations differ in 
goals, groups served, social roles, leadership styles, incentives, types of tasks performed, and type of 
structure. These features help explain differences in organizations’ use of information systems. 
Information systems and the organizations in which they are used interact with and influence each 
other. 
2. What is the impact of information systems on organizations?
The introduction of a new information system will affect organizational structure, goals, work design, 
values, competition between interest groups, decision making, and day-to-day behavior. At the same 
time, information systems must be designed to serve the needs of important organizational groups and 
will be shaped by the organization’s structure, business processes, goals, culture, politics, and manage-
ment. Information technology can reduce transaction and agency costs, and such changes have been 
accentuated in organizations using the Internet. New systems disrupt established patterns of work and 
power relationships, so there is often considerable resistance to them when they are  introduced. 
3. How do Porter’s competitive forces model, the value chain model, synergies, core competencies, and 
network economics help companies develop competitive strategies using information systems?
In Porter’s competitive forces model, the strategic position of the firm, and its strategies, are 
 determined by competition with its traditional direct competitors, but they are also greatly affected by 
new market entrants, substitute products and services, suppliers, and customers. Information systems 
help companies compete by maintaining low costs, differentiating products or services, focusing on 
144 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

market niche, strengthening ties with customers and suppliers, and increasing barriers to market entry with 
high levels of operational excellence.
The value chain model highlights specific activities in the business where competitive strategies and infor-
mation systems will have the greatest impact. The model views the firm as a series of  primary and support 
activities that add value to a firm’s products or services. Primary activities are directly related to production 
and distribution, whereas support activities make the delivery of primary  activities possible. A firm’s value 
chain can be linked to the value chains of its suppliers, distributors, and customers. A value web consists of 
information systems that enhance competitiveness at the industry level by promoting the use of standards 
and industry-wide consortia, and by enabling  businesses to work more efficiently with their value partners. 
Because firms consist of multiple business units, information systems achieve additional  efficiencies or 
enhance services by tying together the operations of disparate business units. Information systems help 
 businesses leverage their core competencies by promoting the sharing of knowledge across  business units. 
Information systems facilitate business models based on large networks of users or  subscribers that take 
advantage of network economics. A virtual company strategy uses networks to link to other firms so that a 
company can use the capabilities of other companies to build, market, and distribute products and services. 
In business ecosystems, multiple industries work together to deliver value to the customer. Information 
 systems support a dense network of interactions among the  participating firms.
4. What are the challenges posed by strategic information systems and how should they be addressed?
Implementing strategic systems often requires extensive organizational change and a transition from one 
sociotechnical level to another. Such changes are called strategic transitions and are often difficult and pain-
ful to achieve. Moreover, not all strategic systems are profitable, and they can be expensive to build. Many 
strategic information systems are easily copied by other firms so that  strategic advantage is not always sus-
tainable.

find the answer? What management decisions could be made using information from these systems?
Improving Decision Making: Using a Database to Clarify Business Strategy 
Software skills: Database querying and reporting; database design
Business skills: Reservation systems; customer analysis
3-10 
 In this exercise, you will use database software to analyze the reservation  transactions for a hotel and use 
that information to fine-tune the hotel’s  business strategy and marketing activities. 
In MyMISLab, you will find a database for hotel reservation transactions developed in Microsoft 
Access with information about The President’s Inn in Cape May, New Jersey. At the Inn, 10 rooms overlook 
side streets, 10 rooms have bay windows that offer limited views of the ocean, and the remaining 10 rooms 
in the front of the hotel face the ocean. Room rates are based on room choice, length of stay, and number 
of guests per room. Room rates are the same for one to four guests. Fifth and sixth guests must pay an 
additional $20 charge each per person per day. Guests  staying for seven days or more receive a 10 percent 
discount on their daily room rates.
The owners currently use a manual reservation and bookkeeping system, which has caused many 
problems. Use the database to develop reports on average length of stay, average visitors per room, base 
revenue per room (i.e., length of visit multiplied by the daily rate), and strongest customer base. After 
answering these questions write a brief report about the Inn’s current business situation and suggest future 
strategies.
Improving Decision Making: Using Web Tools to Configure and Price an

Can This Bookstore Be Saved?
CASE STUDY
B
orders Group (including many former 
Waldenbooks rebranded as Borders Express) 
liquidated its assets and closed all of its 
locations in the second half of 2011. The 
previous year had already seen the demise of B. 
Dalton, a Barnes & Noble subsidiary since 1987. 
Since 1991, eleven major U.S. bookstore chains have 
been whittled down to six, and nearly 3,300 stores to 
just over 2,200 in 2011.
Still in the lead after over 20 years of domina-
tion, Barnes & Noble was often painted as the bully, 
driving both regional chains and small indepen-
dent bookstores out of business with its aggressive 
pricing tactics and unbeatable inventory. Before 
e-commerce reshaped the landscape, its superstores 
forced smaller rivals into “most titles offered” wars. 
As smaller chains struggled to keep pace, support 
from publishers was not forthcoming. This short-
term, bottom-line strategy would come back to haunt 
publishers.
B&N kicked around the idea of selling books 
online, experimenting with Trintex, a 1980s Web-
retail prototype, selling books on CompuServ in the 
mid-1990s, and opening an online shop on AOL. 
However, it was not until 1997, fully two years after 
the arrival of Amazon, that it launched its first Web 
site. Data from numerous emerging e-commerce 
markets now verifies that books are an ideal initial 
product to draw first-time buyers. B&N was already 
behind the curve.
Amazon, launched initially as an online bookstore, 
upended the titles war. While B&N might be able 
to offer over 200,000 titles in its bricks-and-mortar 
stores, Amazon offered an inventory limited only 
by publisher availability. Shrewd financial moves, 
including selling 50% of its Internet operation to 
German giant Bertelsmann in 1998, kept B&N in 
the game. It established a new industry standard of 
750,000 titles on-hand and bragged that it could pro-
cure over 8 million new, out-of-print, and rare books 
for customers from suppliers. However, Amazon 
continued to trump B&N on innovation. When B&N 
launched its online music store in 1999, several 
months after taking barnesandnoble.com public and 
refurbishing its cash reserves, it was again playing 
catch-up with Amazon, which had pioneered the con-
cept a year earlier.
In early 2009, when B&N purchased Fictionwise, 
one of the biggest electronic book proprietors in 
North America, it was again behind the technol-
ogy curve. Amazon had already unveiled its Kindle 
e-reader sixteen months earlier. What’s more, 
Amazon would offer New York Times bestsellers and 
other popular e-books for less than $10.
While publishers fretted that readers would be 
reconditioned to devalue the worth of the printed 
word and that offline stores would be strained to 
their limits discounting print books to compete, 
B&N scrambled. It took until July 2009 (two months 
after the Fictionwise purchase) to finally unveil 
B&N’s e-bookstore. Its Nook e-reader was released in 
October, again more than two years behind Amazon. 
Ironically, as early as 1998, B&N had partnered with 
software companies such as Nuvo-Media to develop a 
prototype e-reader called the Rocket, but it had nixed 
the project in 2003 because there didn’t appear to be 
any money in it. Now it had to hustle to refashion 
itself as a seller of e-books, e-readers, and apps to 
enhance the reading experience.
Critically well-received, the Nook began to scrape 
market share from the Kindle when it sparked a 
price war a year later. Dropping the price from $259 
to $199 and releasing a WiFi-only model for $149, 
B&N took aim at the giant. Amazon quickly coun-
tered by slashing the Kindle to $189 eight hours later 
and releasing the WiFi-enabled 3G Kindle3 within a 
month, again at $10 below the Nook.
With titans such as Apple (iPad) and Google 
(originally with the iRiver Story and in 2012 with the 
Nexus 7) providing additional competition, the tables 
had been turned on the former bookstore baron. Will 
B&N be able to survive against these tech giants?
The answer remains to be seen. B&N was the only 
bookseller with the resources to complete the consid-
erable task of developing an e-reader, marketing it, 
and setting up manufacturing and retail operations 
for the device. Its closest competitors were already 
succumbing to the contraction of the chain bookstore 
market, victims of both B&N and the e-commerce 
revolution. Books-A-Million, with approximately 250 
stores compared to 1,363 (689 retail and 674 college) 
for B&N, is its closest remaining competitor.
While B&N still depends on its physical, brick-and-
mortar stores to drive its business, the e-book mar-
ket is a horse of a different color. The economics of 
148 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

e-book sales are very different from traditional book 
sales. Customers who visit B&N’s Web site buy three 
digital books for every one physical book, but book-
sellers still make more money on print books than 
e-books. And while having a competitive e-reader 
seemed essential to successfully vying for market 
share, it came at a steep cost. Moreover, it is not 
the pivotal factor in controlling the e-book market. 
Content is.
Since the price war, the reality is that in order to 
compete with Amazon, e-reader hardware must sell 
at or near cost, with profits derived from the sale 
of digital content, including e-books, music, vid-
eos, apps, and games. Once Amazon had wrung all 
the profit it could from Kindle hardware, it quickly 
maneuvered into adding apps and app features and 
aggressively pursuing a cross-platform strategy. It 
began marketing its e-books for tablets, smartphones, 
and PCs using Android, Windows, and OS X operat-
ing systems. Moreover, Amazon, along with Apple, 
and another competitor, Kobo, are global competi-
tors; B&N is not.
Despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars 
to compete with Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. 
in the market for tablets and e-readers, B&N contin-
ued to lose money on the Nook, as well as e-book 
market share. Analysts estimated in 2011 that B&N 
controlled approximately 27% of the U.S. digital book 
market while Amazon led with 60%. Since then, 
Amazon has held steady, and B&N has steadily ceded 
ground to Apple. B&N’s digital book market share has 
dropped to 25%, and is still falling.
On June 25, 2013 B&N announced that losses at 
its Nook digital business more than doubled in the 
quarter ending April 27, 2013, wiping out profits 
generated at its bookstores. As a result, the com-
pany decided to stop producing its own color tablets 
in favor of co-branded devices made by third-party 
manufacturers. Barnes & Noble will continue to 
design and make its own black-and-white Nook 
e-readers, which account for the majority of its 
e-book sales. But with e-reader sales declining, it is 
unclear how competitive Barnes & Noble can be long 
term without its own presence in the tablet market, 
which is forecast to keep growing.
B&N retail store closings continued to outpace 
new store openings as had been the case since 2009. 
CEO Michael Klipper projected a net reduction 
of one-third of B&N’s stores over the next decade, 
reducing the total by about 20 stores per year until 
between 450 and 500 remain.
While B&N has its back against the wall, it does 
have a multipronged strategy for survival. It faces 
a principal opponent with an estimated value 121 
times higher than its own (B&N has a market capital-
ization of $1.062 billion; Amazon’s is $121.5 billion). 
But it also has allies. Publishing companies have 
a vested interest in B&N’s survival. Physical book 
retailers are indispensable for effectively marketing 
and selling books. Bookstores spur publisher sales 
with the “browsing effect.” Surveys show that just 
one-third of bookstore visitors who make a purchase 
walked in with a specific book in mind. According 
to Madeline McIntosh, Random House president of 
sales, operations, and digital, a bookstore’s display 
space is one of the most valuable places that exists 
for communicating to the consumer that a book is a 
big deal. Brick-and-mortar retail stores are not only 
essential for selling physical books, but also stimu-
late sales of e-books and audio books, bring traffic 
into malls, and serve as social gathering places. The 
more visibility a book has, the more likely read-
ers will want to purchase it. With the demise of B. 
Dalton, Crown Books, and Borders, B&N is the only 
retailer offering an extensive inventory of physical 
books. Book publishers need a physical presence.
Without B&N, the likely candidate to fill the void 
is Amazon, and publishers are not eager for that to 
happen. Amazon’s goal for e-books is to cut out the 
publishers and publish books directly, selling books 
at an extremely steep discount to drive sales of its 
Kindle devices. Editors, publicists, and other entities 
within the publishing business view Amazon as an 
enemy. Selling books at Amazon’s discounted prices 
is not a tenable business model for publishers in the 
long-term.
If B&N is to survive it must capitalize on its profit-
able retail stores, develop small, local community-
based shops, expand digital content, lead the digital 
education market, and develop marketing techniques 
to drive e-book readers to purchase print books. B&N 
has been experimenting with ways to drive traffic 
to its physical stores. For example, if you connect 
to a Wi-Fi network in a B&N store with your Nook, 
you can get free extras in many apps and games 
like Angry Birds, where you can unlock a bonus 
character that normally costs a dollar. B&N has also 
expanded its store space for toys and games, which 
have higher profit margins, while reducing the range 
of book titles it stocks. There are also plans to experi-
ment with slightly smaller stores in malls. Although 
that strategy is boosting the company’s bottom line, 
publishers worry it may also drive book lovers to 
Amazon.com Inc., which says its physical book sales 
are still growing.

What will the future hold? Will B&N be able to 
succeed as a digital company and is there a future 
for its brick-and-mortar stores? Is there a way for 
e-books to help sell print books, just as print books 
have stimulated demand for their digital versions? 
Although B&N has made a spirited effort to revamp 
its business and go toe-to-toe with several tech titans, 
it’s possible that it might be too tall an order for the 
storied bookseller.

ore than 11 million HBO subscribers watched each episode of 
Game of Thrones in 2012, but another 3.7 to 4.2 million were able 
to watch the same shows without  paying a cent. They were 
 watching pirated versions of each episode that were made 
 available by companies specializing in distributing digital content for free 
without paying the owners and creators of that content for using it. Television 
shows, music, movies, and videogames have all been plundered this way.
Such “content pirates” have sailed the World Wide Web since its earliest 
days, but today they are bolder, faster and better equipped than ever. The 
 antipiracy and security firm Irdeto detected 14 billion instances of pirated 
online content in 2012, up from 5.4 billion instances in 2009. 
Pirated content threatens television industry profits, much of which comes 
from  subscription fees on cable channels like HBO and USA. Viewers  watching 
pirated  versions of shows are less likely to pay for cable subscriptions or to buy 
movies or rent them from services such as Netflix. According to one  estimate, 
pirated content costs the U.S. economy $58 billion a year, including theft of 
 content, lost entertainment jobs and taxes lost to federal and state  governments. 
The explosion in pirated TV shows and movies has been made possible by 
faster Internet speeds. Longer videos can be downloaded within minutes from 
peer-to-peer networks and online cyberlockers. A great deal of illegal content, 
including live sports, is also available through instant streaming. Online ad 
 networks also help finance piracy by placing ads on sites that traffic in unau-
thorized content. A summer 2012 study commissioned in part by Google found 
that 86 percent of peer-to-peer sharing sites depend on advertising for income.
CONTENT PIRATES SAIL THE WEB

One of the biggest content pirate sites is The Pirate Bay, based in Sweden, 
which offers free access to millions of copyrighted songs and thousands of 
copyrighted movies. The Pirate Bay uses BitTorrent file-sharing technology, 
which breaks up large computer files into small pieces so they can zip across 
the Web. In April 2014, The Pirate Bay had over 6.5 million registered users and 
was the 87th most trafficked site in the world. There have been many legal 
efforts to shut it down, but The Pirate Bay finds ways to keep going. 
What can be done to stop this pirating? Google adjusted its search algorithm 
to obscure search results for sites with pirated content. NBCUniversal uses 
armies of automated “ crawlers” to scour the Web for unauthorized videos and 
also applies “content recognition”  technology to its programming, which it then 
passes on to video sites like YouTube to help block illegal uploads. NBC sends 
out digital snapshots of its shows to YouTube and other video sites to prevent 
users from putting up copyrighted shows. The five major Internet service 
 providers, including NBC’s parent company, Comcast,  initiated an alert system 
which notifies users suspected of piracy and results in progressive penalties, 
including slowed Web access in some cases. Digital content owners are  taking 
much harder stance with advertising networks and payment platforms support-
ing piracy to encourage them to close down ad-funded pirate sites.
New products and services have made pirated content less attractive. High-
quality content now can be streamed for a small fee to both tethered and mobile 
devices. Apple’s iTunes made buying individual songs inexpensive and easy, 
while new subscription-based services such as Spotify and Rhapsody have 
attracted 20 million paying subscribers. Netflix and other video services offer 
access to movies and television shows at low prices. Right now content pirates 
are still sailing, but new and better ways to listen to music and view videos may 
eventually put them out of business.

T
he prevalence and brazen activities of “content pirates” described in the 
 chapter-opening case show that technology can be a double-edged sword. 
It can be the source of many benefits, including the ability to share and  transmit 
legitimate photos, music, videos, and information over the Internet at high 
speeds. But, at the same time, digital technology creates new opportunities for 
breaking the law or taking benefits away from others, including owners of 
 valuable  intellectual property, such as music, videos, and television shows that 
are  protected by copyright law.
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter. Content pirating has become rampant because of 
opportunities created by broadband communications technology and the global 
nature of the Internet. Various policies and technology solutions have been 
put in place to put a stop to content piracy, but the practice still prevails. New 
technology-based products and services that make online content purchase and 
downloads very quick and inexpensive may eventually provide a solution.
This case illustrates an ethical dilemma because it shows two sets of  interests 
at work— the interests of people and organizations that have worked to 
develop intellectual property and need to be rewarded versus those of groups 
who  fervently believe the Internet should foster the free exchange of  content

4.1 
WHAT ETHICAL, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL ISSUES 
ARE RAISED BY INFORMATION SYSTEMS? 
I
n the past 10 years, we have witnessed, arguably, one of the most  ethically 
challenging  periods for U.S. and global business. Table 4.1 provides a small 
sample of recent cases  demonstrating failed ethical  judgment by senior 
and middle managers. These lapses in ethical and business judgment 
occurred across a broad spectrum of industries.
In today’s new legal environment, managers who violate the law and are con-
victed will most likely spend time in prison. U.S. federal sentencing  guidelines 
adopted in 1987  mandate that federal judges impose stiff sentences on  business 
executives based on the  monetary value of the crime, the  presence of a conspir-
acy to prevent discovery of the crime, the use of  structured  financial transactions 
to hide the crime, and failure to cooperate with prosecutors (U.S. Sentencing 
Commission, 2004). 
Although business firms would, in the past, often pay for the legal defense of 
their employees enmeshed in civil charges and criminal investigations, firms 
are  now encouraged to cooperate with prosecutors to reduce charges against 
the entire firm for obstructing  investigations. These developments mean that, 
more than ever, as a manager or an employee, you will have to decide for 
 yourself what constitutes proper legal and ethical  conduct.
Although these major instances of failed ethical and legal judgment were 
not  masterminded by information systems departments, information systems 
were  instrumental in many of these frauds. In many cases, the perpetrators of 
these crimes artfully used  financial reporting information systems to bury their 
 decisions from public scrutiny in the vain hope they would never be caught. 
and ideas. As a manager, you will need to be sensitive to both the positive 
and  negative impacts of information systems for your firm, employees and 
 customers. You will need to learn how to resolve ethical dilemmas involving 
information systems.
 
Chapter 4 Ethical and Social Issues in Information Systems 
157

We deal with the issue of control in information systems in Chapter 8. In this 
chapter, we will talk about the ethical dimensions of these and other actions 
based on the use of information systems.
Ethics refers to the principles of right and wrong that individuals, acting as 
free moral agents, use to make choices to guide their behaviors. Information 
systems raise new  ethical questions for both individuals and societies because 
they create opportunities for intense social change, and thus threaten  existing 
distributions of power, money, rights, and  obligations. Like other technolo-
gies, such as steam engines, electricity, the telephone, and the radio, informa-
tion technology can be used to achieve social progress, but it can also be used 
to commit crimes and threaten cherished social values. The development of 
 information technology will produce benefits for many and costs for others. 
Ethical issues in information systems have been given new urgency by the rise 
of the Internet and electronic commerce. Internet and digital firm  technologies 
make it easier than ever to assemble, integrate, and distribute information, 
unleashing new concerns about the appropriate use of customer information, the 
protection of personal privacy, and the  protection of intellectual property. 
TABLE 4.1 RECENT EXAMPLES OF FAILED ETHICAL JUDGMENT BY SENIOR MANAGERS

Federal prosecutors accused Bank of America and its affiliate Countrywide Financial of defrauding 
government-backed mortgage agencies by churning out loans at a rapid pace without proper controls. 
Prosecutors are seeking $1 billion in penalties from the bank as compensation for the behavior that they say 
forced taxpayers to guarantee billions in bad loans.
158 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

Other pressing ethical issues raised by information systems include 
 establishing  accountability for the consequences of information systems, 
 setting standards to safeguard system quality that protects the safety of the 
individual and society, and preserving values and institutions  considered 
essential to the  quality of life in an information society. When using 
 information systems, it is essential to ask, “What is the ethical and socially 
responsible course of action?”
A MODEL FOR THINKING ABOUT ETHICAL, SOCIAL, AND 
POLITICAL ISSUES
Ethical, social, and political issues are closely linked. The ethical dilemma you 
may face as a manager of information systems typically is reflected in social 
and political debate. One way to think about these relationships is shown in 
Figure 4.1. Imagine society as a more or less calm pond on a summer day, a 
 delicate ecosystem in partial equilibrium with  individuals and with social and 
political institutions. Individuals know how to act in this pond because social 
institutions (family, education, organizations) have developed  well-honed rules 
of behavior, and these are supported by laws developed in the political sector 
that  prescribe behavior and promise sanctions for  violations. Now toss a rock 
into the center of the pond. What  happens? Ripples, of course.
 FIGURE 4.1 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ETHICAL, SOCIAL, AND 
POLITICAL ISSUES IN AN INFORMATION SOCIETY
The introduction of new information technology has a ripple effect, raising new ethical, social, and 
political issues that must be dealt with on the individual, social, and political levels. These issues have 
five moral dimensions: information rights and obligations, property rights and obligations, system 
quality, quality of life, and accountability and control.
 
Chapter 4 Ethical and Social Issues in Information Systems 
159

Imagine instead that the disturbing force is a powerful shock of new informa-
tion  technology and systems hitting a society more or less at rest. Suddenly, 
individual actors are confronted with new situations often not  covered by the 
old rules. Social institutions  cannot respond overnight to these ripples—it may 
take years to develop etiquette, expectations, social responsibility, politically 
correct attitudes, or approved rules. Political institutions also require time 
before developing new laws and often require the demonstration of real harm 
before they act. In the meantime, you may have to act. You may be forced to act 
in a legal gray area.
We can use this model to illustrate the dynamics that connect ethical, social, 
and  political issues. This model is also useful for identifying the main moral 
dimensions of the  information society, which cut across various levels of 
action—individual, social, and  political.
FIVE MORAL DIMENSIONS OF THE INFORMATION AGE
The major ethical, social, and political issues raised by information systems 
include the  following moral dimensions: 
• Information rights and obligations. What information rights do individuals and 
 organizations possess with respect to themselves? What can they protect?
• Property rights and obligations. How will traditional intellectual property 
rights be  protected in a digital society in which tracing and accounting for 
ownership are difficult and ignoring such property rights is so easy?
• Accountability and control. Who can and will be held accountable and liable for 
the harm done to individual and collective information and property rights?
• System quality. What standards of data and system quality should we demand 
to protect individual rights and the safety of society?
• Quality of life. What values should be preserved in an information- and 
 knowledge-based society? Which institutions should we protect from 
 violation? Which cultural values and practices are supported by the new 
information technology?
We explore these moral dimensions in detail in Section 4.3.
KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS THAT RAISE ETHICAL 
ISSUES
Ethical issues long preceded information technology. Nevertheless, 
 information technology has heightened ethical concerns, taxed existing social 
 arrangements, and made some laws obsolete or severely crippled. There are 
five key  technological trends responsible for these ethical stresses and they are 
summarized in Table 4.2.
The doubling of computing power every 18 months has made it possible 
for most  organizations to use information systems for their core production 
processes. As a result, our dependence on systems and our vulnerability to 
 system errors and poor data quality have increased. Social rules and laws have 
not yet adjusted to this dependence. Standards for ensuring the accuracy and 
reliability of information systems (see Chapter 8) are not  universally accepted 
or enforced.
Advances in data storage techniques and rapidly declining storage costs 
have been responsible for the multiplying databases on individuals—employ-
ees,  customers, and  potential customers—maintained by private and public 
 organizations. These advances in data storage have made the routine violation 
160 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

of  individual privacy both cheap and effective. Enormous data storage  systems 
for terabytes and petabytes of data are now available on-site or as online  services 
for firms of all sizes to use in identifying customers.
Advances in data analysis techniques for large pools of data are another 
 technological trend that heightens ethical concerns because companies and 
government agencies are able to find out highly detailed personal information 
about individuals. With contemporary data management tools (see Chapter 6), 
companies can assemble and combine the myriad pieces of information about 
you stored on computers much more easily than in the past. 
Think of all the ways you generate computer information about yourself—
credit card purchases, telephone calls, magazine subscriptions, video  rentals, 
mail-order purchases, banking records, local, state, and federal government 
records (including court and police records), and visits to Web sites. Put 
together and mined properly, this information could reveal not only your credit 
 information but also your driving habits, your tastes, your  associations, what 
you read and watch, and your political interests. 
Companies with products to sell purchase relevant information from these 
sources to help them more finely target their marketing campaigns. Chapters 
6 and 11 describe how companies can analyze large pools of data from  multiple 
sources to rapidly identify  buying patterns of customers and suggest individ-
ual responses. The use of computers to  combine data from multiple sources 
and create electronic dossiers of detailed information on  individuals is called 
profiling.
For example, several thousand of the most popular Web sites allow 
DoubleClick (owned by Google), an Internet advertising broker, to track the 
activities of their visitors in exchange for revenue from advertisements based 
on visitor information DoubleClick gathers. DoubleClick uses this informa-
tion to create a profile of each online visitor, adding more detail to the profile 
as the visitor accesses an associated DoubleClick site. Over time, DoubleClick 
can create a detailed dossier of a person’s spending and  computing habits 
on the Web that is sold to companies to help them target their Web ads more 
 precisely. The top 50 Web sites in the United States contain on average over 
100 tracking programs installed by advertising firms to track your online 
behavior.
ChoicePoint gathers data from police, criminal, and motor vehicle records, 
credit and employment histories, current and previous addresses,  professional 
licenses, and insurance claims to assemble and maintain electronic  dossiers 
on almost every adult in the United States. The company sells this  personal 
 information to businesses and government agencies. Demand for  personal

data is so enormous that data broker businesses such as ChoicePoint are 
 flourishing. The two largest credit card networks, Visa Inc. and MasterCard 
Inc., have agreed to link credit card purchase information with consumer 
social network and other information to create customer profiles that could 
be sold to advertising firms. In 2013, Visa processed more than 45 billion 
transactions a year and MasterCard processed more than 23  billion transac-
tions. Currently, this transactional information is not linked with  consumer 
Internet activities.
A new data analysis technology called nonobvious relationship aware-
ness (NORA) has given both the government and the private sector even more 
 powerful profiling  capabilities. NORA can take information about  people from 
many disparate sources, such as employment applications,  telephone records, 
customer listings, and “wanted” lists, and correlate  relationships to find obscure 
hidden connections that might help identify criminals or  terrorists (see Figure 4.2). 
NORA technology scans data and extracts information as the data are 
being generated so that it could, for example, instantly discover a man at an 
airline ticket counter who shares a phone number with a known  terrorist 
before that person boards an airplane. The technology is considered a 
 valuable tool for homeland security but does have privacy implications 
because it can provide such a detailed picture of the activities and associa-
tions of a single individual.
An example of how government and private industry not only use the 
same data mining techniques to identify and track individuals, but in cases of 
national security, closely cooperate with one another in gathering data, was 
provided by the unauthorized release of documents describing the  electronic 
surveillance activities of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).
Finally, advances in networking, including the Internet, promise to greatly 
reduce the costs of moving and accessing large quantities of data and open 
the possibility of  mining large pools of data remotely using small desktop 
machines, permitting an invasion of  privacy on a scale and with a precision

WHAT SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES FOR CONDUCT CAN 
BE USED TO GUIDE ETHICAL DECISIONS?
Ethics is a concern of humans who have freedom of choice. Ethics is about 
 individual choice: When faced with alternative courses of action, what is the 
correct moral choice? What are the main features of ethical choice?
BASIC CONCEPTS: RESPONSIBILITY, ACCOUNTABILITY, 
AND LIABILITY
Ethical choices are decisions made by individuals who are responsible for the 
 consequences of their actions. Responsibility is a key element of ethical action. 
Responsibility means that you accept the potential costs, duties, and obligations 
for the decisions you make. Accountability is a feature of systems and social 
institutions: It means that  mechanisms are in place to determine who took 
 FIGURE 4.2 
NONOBVIOUS RELATIONSHIP AWARENESS (NORA)
NORA technology can take information about people from disparate sources and find obscure, 
 nonobvious relationships. It might discover, for example, that an applicant for a job at a casino shares 
a telephone number with a known criminal and issue an alert to the hiring manager.

I NTE RACT IVE S ES SIO N : MA N A G E ME N T
MONITORING IN THE WORKPLACE
There may be only 11 players on the pitch during a 
match, but the Blackburn Rovers Football Club in the 
UK employs more than 800 people. As with any mod-
ern organization, computers are at the heart of run-
ning an efficient business. Most of the club’s comput-
ers are housed with the administration department at 
the Ewood Park office, but others can be found at the 
club’s training center and soccer academy.
The club decided to install a software product 
called Spector 360, which it obtained from the 
Manchester-based company Snapguard. According to 
Snapguard’s sales literature, the product enables com-
pany-wide monitoring of employee PC and Internet 
usage. Previously, the club had tried to introduce an 
acceptable use policy (AUP), but initial discussions 
with employees stalled, and the policy was never 
implemented. Early trials of Spector 360 showed that 
some employees were abusing the easygoing nature 
of the workplace to spend most of their day surfing 
the Web, using social networking sites, and taking up a 
huge amount of bandwidth for downloads.
Before officially implementing the monitor-
ing software, the AUP was resurrected. The policy 
was also made part of the terms and conditions of 
employment. Understandably, some employees were 
annoyed at the concept of being watched, but the soft-
ware was installed anyway. According to Ben Hayler, 
senior systems administrator at Blackburn Rovers, 
Spector 360 has definitely restored order, increasing 
productivity and reducing activity on non-business 
apps.
Reports provided by Spector 360 can show manag-
ers the following: excessive use of Facebook, Twitter, 
and other social networking sites; visits to adult sites 
or shopping sites; use of chat services; the printing 
or saving of confidential information; and staff login 
and logout times. Managers can also use the software 
to drill-down to look at patterns of usage, generate 
screen snapshots, or even log individual keystrokes.
The software can also be used to benefit employ-
ees. For example, because it can log exactly what an 
employee is doing, the system can help in staff train-
ing and troubleshooting, because it is easy to track 
exactly what caused a particular problem to occur.
Another important benefit of the software is that 
it helps the club to stay compliant with the Payment 
Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard. PCI 
standards require access to credit card information. 
As Spector 360 tracks and records all data to do with 
credit card transactions, the information can be easily 
recovered.
However, what is the wider view of the monitor-
ing of employees in the workplace? According to the 
Citizens Advice Bureau (a free information and advice 
service for UK residents), the following are some of 
the ways that employers monitor their employees 
in the workplace: recording the workplace on CCTV 
cameras, opening mail or e-mail, using automated 
software to check e-mail, checking telephone logs or 
recording telephone calls, checking logs of Web sites 
visited, videoing outside the workplace, getting infor-
mation from credit reference agencies, and collecting 
information from point-of-sale terminals.
Although this list may look formidable, there is no 
argument that the employer has a right to ensure that 
his or her employees are behaving in a manner that 
is not illegal or harmful to the company. However, 
under UK data protection law, the employer must 
ensure that the monitoring is justified and take into 
account any negative effects the monitoring may have 
on staff. Monitoring for the sake of it is not allowed. 
Secret monitoring without employees’ knowledge is 
usually illegal.
In a case that went before the European Court 
of Human Rights in 2007 (Copeland v. the United 
Kingdom), Ms. Copeland, who was an employee of 
Carmarthenshire College, claimed that her privacy 
had been violated. She was a personal assistant to the 
principal and also worked closely with the deputy 
principal, who instigated monitoring and analysis of 
her telephone bills, Web sites visited, and e-mail com-
munication. The deputy principal wanted to deter-
mine whether Copeland was making excessive use of 
the college’s services. The European Court ruled in 
her favor, stating that her personal Internet usage was 
deemed to be under the definitions of the Convention 
for the Protection of Rights, covered as “private life.”
The major fault of Carmarthenshire College was 
in not having a usage policy in place. Employers and 
employees should have an agreed-upon policy as part 
of the contract of employment that clarifies what is 
and is not acceptable computer usage in the work-
place. The employer can then follow normal disciplin-
ary procedures if an employee is using workplace 
equipment in a manner that is not permitted in the 
contract of employment.

nomic disparities? Explain your answer.
2. Why is access to technology insufficient to elimi-
nate the digital divide?
Whatever the legal situation, it is clear where 
potential problems can occur in the workplace regard-
ing information technology use. An e-mail, once sent, 
becomes a legally published document that can be 
produced as evidence in court cases involving issues 
of libel, breach of contract, and so on. Most businesses 
rely on their company data to keep ahead of the com-
petition. Therefore, the loss, theft, or sabotage of data 
is potentially more dangerous than similar problems 
with hardware. If a USB memory stick is lost in a bar 
parking lot, replacing the hardware will cost a few dol-
lars, but if it contains the company’s confidential data, 
then its loss could put the company out of business!

 responsible action, and who is  responsible. Systems and institutions in which 
it is impossible to find out who took what action are  inherently  incapable of 
 ethical analysis or ethical action. Liability extends the concept of  responsibility 
further to the area of laws. Liability is a feature of political  systems in which a 
body of laws is in place that permits individuals to recover the damages done 
to them by other actors,  systems, or organizations. Due  process is a related 
feature of law-governed societies and is a process in which laws are known and 
understood, and there is an ability to appeal to higher authorities to ensure that 
the laws are applied correctly.
These basic concepts form the underpinning of an ethical analysis of 
 information  systems and those who manage them. First, information tech-
nologies are filtered through social institutions, organizations, and individu-
als. Systems do not have impacts by  themselves. Whatever information system

impacts exist are products of institutional, organizational, and individual actions 
and behaviors. Second, responsibility for the consequences of  technology falls 
clearly on the institutions, organizations, and individual managers who choose 
to use the  technology. Using information technology in a socially responsible 
manner means that you can and will be held accountable for the consequences 
of your actions. Third, in an  ethical, political society, individuals and others can 
recover damages done to them through a set of laws  characterized by due process.
ETHICAL ANALYSIS
When confronted with a situation that seems to present ethical issues, how 
should you  analyze it? The following five-step process should help:
1. Identify and describe the facts clearly. Find out who did what to whom, and 
where, when, and how. In many instances, you will be surprised at the errors 
in the initially reported facts, and often you will find that simply getting the 
facts straight helps define the solution. It also helps to get the opposing parties 
involved in an ethical dilemma to agree on the facts.
2. Define the conflict or dilemma and identify the higher-order values involved. Ethical, 
social, and political issues always reference higher values. The parties to a 
 dispute all claim to be pursuing higher values (e.g., freedom, privacy, protection 
of property, and the free enterprise system). Typically, an ethical issue involves 
a dilemma: two  diametrically opposed courses of action that support 
 worthwhile values. For example, the  chapter-opening case study illustrates two 
competing values: the need to improve access to digital content and the need to 
respect the property rights of the owners of that content.
3. Identify the stakeholders. Every ethical, social, and political issue has stakehold-
ers:  players in the game who have an interest in the outcome, who have 
invested in the  situation, and usually who have vocal opinions. Find out the 
identity of these groups and what they want. This will be useful later when 
designing a solution.
4. Identify the options that you can reasonably take. You may find that none of the 
options satisfy all the interests involved, but that some options do a better job 
than  others. Sometimes arriving at a good or ethical solution may not always be 
a balancing of  consequences to stakeholders.
5. Identify the potential consequences of your options. Some options may be ethically 
 correct but disastrous from other points of view. Other options may work in one 
instance but not in other similar instances. Always ask yourself, “What if I 
choose this option consistently over time?”
CANDIDATE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES
Once your analysis is complete, what ethical principles or rules should you use 
to make a decision? What higher-order values should inform your judgment? 
Although you are the only one who can decide which among many ethical 
 principles you will follow, and how you will prioritize them, it is helpful to 
consider some ethical principles with deep roots in many cultures that have 
survived throughout recorded history:
1. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you (the Golden Rule). 
Putting yourself into the place of others, and thinking of yourself as the object 
of the decision, can help you think about fairness in decision making. 
2. If an action is not right for everyone to take, it is not right for anyone 
(Immanuel Kant’s Categorical Imperative). Ask yourself, “If everyone did 
this, could the organization, or society, survive?”
166 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

3. If an action cannot be taken repeatedly, it is not right to take at all. This is the 
slippery-slope rule: An action may bring about a small change now that is 
acceptable, but if it is repeated, it would bring  unacceptable changes in the long 
run. In the vernacular, it might be stated as “once started down a slippery path, 
you may not be able to stop.”
4. Take the action that achieves the higher or greater value (Utilitarian 
Principle). This rule assumes you can prioritize values in a rank order and 
understand the consequences of various courses of action.
5. Take the action that produces the least harm or the least potential cost (Risk 
Aversion Principle). Some actions have extremely high failure costs of very 
low probability (e.g., building a nuclear generating facility in an urban area) or 
extremely high failure costs of moderate probability (speeding and automobile 
accidents). Avoid these  high-failure-cost actions, paying greater attention to 
high-failure-cost potential of moderate to high  probability.
6. Assume that virtually all tangible and intangible objects are owned by someone 
else unless there is a specific declaration otherwise. (This is the ethical “no free 
lunch” rule.) If something someone else has created is useful to you, it has 
value, and you should assume the creator wants compensation for this work.
Actions that do not easily pass these rules deserve close attention and a great 
deal of  caution. The appearance of unethical behavior may do as much harm to 
you and your  company as actual unethical behavior.
PROFESSIONAL CODES OF CONDUCT
When groups of people claim to be professionals, they take on special rights 
and obligations because of their special claims to knowledge, wisdom, and 
respect. Professional codes of conduct are promulgated by associations 
of professionals, such as the American Medical Association (AMA), the 
American Bar Association (ABA), the Association of Information Technology 
Professionals (AITP), and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). 
These professional groups take responsibility for the partial regulation of 
their professions by  determining entrance qualifications and competence. 
Codes of ethics are promises by  professions to regulate themselves in the 
general interest of society. For example,  avoiding harm to others, honor-
ing property rights (including  intellectual  property), and  respecting privacy 
are among the General Moral Imperatives of the ACM’s Code of Ethics and 
Professional Conduct.
SOME REAL-WORLD ETHICAL DILEMMAS
Information systems have created new ethical dilemmas in which one set of interests 
is pitted against another. For example, many of the large telephone companies in the 
United States are using information technology to reduce the sizes of their workforces. 
Voice  recognition software reduces the need for human operators by 
enabling computers to  recognize a  customer’s responses to a series of 
computerized questions. Many companies monitor what their employ-
ees are doing on the Internet to prevent them from wasting company 
resources on non-business activities. Facebook monitors its subscribers and 
then sells the information to advertisers and app developers (see the chapter-
ending case study). 
In each instance, you can find competing values at work, with groups lined 
up on either side of a debate. A company may argue, for example, that it has a 
right to use  information  systems to increase productivity and reduce the size 
 
Chapter 4 Ethical and Social Issues in Information Systems 
167

of its workforce to lower costs and stay in business. Employees displaced by 
information systems may argue that employers have some responsibility for 
their welfare. Business owners might feel obligated to monitor employee e-mail 
and Internet use to minimize drains on productivity. Employees might believe 
they should be able to use the Internet for short personal tasks in place of the 
 telephone. A close analysis of the facts can sometimes produce compromised 
solutions that give each side “half a loaf.” Try to apply some of the principles of 
ethical analysis described to each of these cases. What is the right thing to do?
4.3 
WHY DO CONTEMPORARY INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
TECHNOLOGY AND THE INTERNET POSE 
CHALLENGES TO THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL 
PRIVACY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY?
In this section, we take a closer look at the five moral dimensions of informa-
tion  systems first described in Figure 4.1. In each dimension, we  identify the 
ethical, social, and  political levels of analysis and use real-world examples to 
illustrate the values involved, the  stakeholders, and the options chosen.
INFORMATION RIGHTS: PRIVACY AND FREEDOM IN 
THE INTERNET AGE
Privacy is the claim of individuals to be left alone, free from surveillance or 
interference from other individuals or organizations, including the state. Claims 
to privacy are also involved at the workplace: Millions of employees are subject 
to electronic and other forms of high-tech surveillance. Information technology 
and systems threaten individual claims to privacy by making the invasion of 
privacy cheap, profitable, and effective.
The claim to privacy is protected in the U.S., Canadian, and German 
 constitutions in a variety of different ways and in other countries through 
 various statutes. In the United States, the claim to privacy is protected primar-
ily by the First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and association, 
the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure of 
one’s  personal documents or home, and the guarantee of due process. 
Table 4.3 describes the major U.S. federal statutes that set forth the 
 conditions for  handling information about individuals in such areas as credit 
 reporting,  education,  financial records, newspaper records, and electronic 
 communications. The Privacy Act of 1974 has been the most important of 
these laws, regulating the federal government’s collection, use, and disclosure 
of information. At present, most U.S. federal privacy laws apply only to the 
 federal  government and regulate very few areas of the private sector.
Most American and European privacy law is based on a regime called Fair 
Information Practices (FIP) first set forth in a report written in 1973 by a 
 federal government advisory committee and updated most recently in 2010 to 
take into account new privacy-invading technology (FTC, 2010; U.S. Department 
of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1973). FIP is a set of principles governing 
the collection and use of information about individuals. FIP principles are 
based on the notion of a mutuality of interest between the record holder and 
the individual. The individual has an interest in engaging in a transaction, 
and the record keeper—usually a business or government agency—requires 
168 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

information about the  individual to support the transaction. Once information 
is  gathered, the individual maintains an  interest in the record, and the record 
may not be used to support other  activities without the  individual’s consent. 
In 1998, the FTC restated and extended the original FIP to provide guidelines 
for protecting online privacy. Table 4.4 describes the FTC’s Fair Information 
Practice principles. 
The FTC’s FIP principles are being used as guidelines to drive changes in 
 privacy  legislation. In July 1998, the U.S. Congress passed the Children’s Online 
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), requiring Web sites to obtain parental permis-
sion before  collecting  information on children under the age of 13. The FTC 
has recommended additional  legislation to  protect online consumer privacy in 
advertising networks that collect records of consumer Web  activity to develop 
detailed profiles, which are then used by other  companies to target online ads. 
In 2010, the FTC added three practices to its framework for privacy. Firms 
should adopt “privacy by design,” building products and services that protect 
privacy. Firms should increase the transparency of their data practices. And 
firms should require consumer consent and provide clear options to opt out of

1. 
 Notice/awareness (core principle). Web sites must disclose their information practices before collecting data. Includes identification of 
collector; uses of data; other recipients of data; nature of collection (active/inactive); voluntary or required status; consequences of refusal; 
and steps taken to protect confidentiality, integrity, and quality of the data.
2. 
 Choice/consent (core principle). There must be a choice regime in place allowing consumers to choose how their information will be used 
for secondary purposes other than supporting the transaction, including internal use and transfer to third parties. 
3. 
 Access/participation. Consumers should be able to review and contest the accuracy and completeness of data collected about them in a 
timely, inexpensive process.
4. 
 Security. Data collectors must take responsible steps to assure that consumer information is accurate and secure from unauthorized use.
5. 
 Enforcement. There must be in place a mechanism to enforce FIP principles. This can involve self-regulation, legislation giving consumers 
legal remedies for violations, or federal statutes and regulations.

data collection schemes (FTC, 2010). Other proposed Internet privacy legisla-
tion focuses on protecting the online use of personal identification  numbers, 
such as social security numbers; protecting personal information  collected on 
the Internet that deals with individuals not covered by COPPA; and limiting the 
use of data mining for homeland security.
Beginning in 2009 and continuing through 2012, the FTC extended its FIP 
doctrine to address the issue of behavioral targeting. The FTC held hearings to 
discuss its program for voluntary industry principles for regulating behavioral 
 targeting. The online advertising trade group Network Advertising Initiative 
(discussed later in this section), published its own  self-regulatory principles 
that largely agreed with the FTC. Nevertheless, the government, privacy 
groups, and the online ad industry are still at loggerheads over two issues. 
Privacy advocates want both an opt-in policy at all sites and a national Do Not 
Track list. The industry opposes these moves and continues to insist on an 
opt-out capability being the only way to avoid tracking. In May 2011, Senator 
Jay D. Rockefeller (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee 
on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Insurance, held hearings to 
discuss consumer privacy  concerns and to explore the  possible role of the 
federal government in protecting consumers in the mobile marketplace. 
Rockefeller supports the Do-Not-Track Online Act of 2011 (reintroduced in 
2013), which requires firms to notify consumers they are being tracked and 
allows consumers to opt out of the tracking (U.S. Senate, 2011). Nevertheless, 
there is an emerging consensus among all parties that greater transparency 
and user control (especially making opting out of tracking the default option) 
is required to deal with  behavioral tracking. While there are many studies of 
privacy issues at the federal level, there has been no significant legislation in 
recent years. 
Privacy protections have also been added to recent laws deregulating 
 financial services and safeguarding the maintenance and transmission of 
health  information about  individuals. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, 
which repeals earlier restrictions on affiliations among banks, securities firms, 
and insurance companies, includes some privacy protection for  consumers of 
 financial services. All financial institutions are required to disclose their  policies 
and practices for protecting the privacy of nonpublic personal  information 
and to allow  customers to opt out of information-sharing arrangements with 
 nonaffiliated third  parties. 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, 
which took effect on April 14, 2003, includes privacy protection for  medical 
records. The law gives patients access to their personal medical records 
 maintained by health care providers, hospitals, and health insurers, and the 
right to authorize how protected information about themselves can be used or 
 disclosed. Doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers must limit the 
 disclosure of personal information about patients to the minimum amount 
 necessary to achieve a given purpose.
The European Directive on Data Protection 
In Europe, privacy protection is much more stringent than in the United States. 
Unlike the United States, European countries do not allow businesses to use per-
sonally  identifiable information without consumers’ prior consent. On October 
25, 1998, the European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection went into 
effect, broadening privacy  protection in the European Union (EU) nations. The 
directive requires companies to inform people when they collect information 
about them and disclose how it will be stored and used. Customers must provide 
170 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

their informed consent before any company can legally use data about them, 
and they have the right to access that information, correct it, and request that 
no further data be collected. Informed consent can be defined as consent given 
with  knowledge of all the facts needed to make a rational  decision. EU member 
nations must translate these principles into their own laws and cannot transfer 
personal data to countries, such as the United States, that do not have simi-
lar privacy protection regulations. In 2009, the European Parliament passed 
new rules governing the use of third-party cookies for  behavioral tracking pur-
poses. These new rules were implemented in May 2011 and require that Web 
site visitors must give explicit consent to be tracked by cookies. Web sites will 
be required to have highly visible warnings on their pages if third-party cookies 
are being used (European Parliament, 2009).
In January 2012, the E.U. issued significant proposed changes to its data 
protection rules, the first overhaul since 1995 (European Commission, 2012). 
The new rules would apply to all companies providing services in Europe, 
and require Internet companies like Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Google, and 
others to obtain explicit consent from consumers about the use of their per-
sonal data, delete information at the user’s request (based on the “right to be 
forgotten”), and retain information only as long as absolutely necessary. In 
2014 the European Union is considering significant changes in privacy policies 
by extending greater control to users of the Internet. While the privacy poli-
cies of United States firms are largely voluntary, in Europe privacy policies are 
mandated, and more consistent across jurisdictions. Among the changes being 
discussed are a requirement that firms inform users before collecting data, and 
every time they collect data, and how it will be used. Users would have to give 
consent to any data collection. Other proposals call for users to have a “right of 
access” to personal data, and the “right to be forgotten.” 
Working with the European Commission, the U.S. Department of Commerce 
 developed a safe harbor framework for U.S. firms. A safe harbor is a private, 
self-regulating  policy and enforcement mechanism that meets the objectives of 
government regulators and  legislation but does not involve government regu-
lation or enforcement. U.S. businesses would be allowed to use personal data 
from EU countries if they develop privacy protection policies that meet EU 
standards. Enforcement would occur in the United States using self-policing, 
regulation, and government enforcement of fair trade statutes.
Internet Challenges to Privacy
Internet technology has posed new challenges for the protection of individual 
privacy. Information sent over this vast network of networks may pass through 
many different  computer systems before it reaches its final destination. Each of 
these systems is capable of monitoring, capturing, and storing communications 
that pass through it.
Web sites track searches that have been conducted, the Web sites and Web pages 
 visited, the online content a person has accessed, and what items that  person has 
inspected or purchased over the Web. This monitoring and  tracking of Web site 
 visitors occurs in the background without the visitor’s knowledge. It is  conducted 
not just by individual Web sites but by advertising networks such as Microsoft 
Advertising, Yahoo, and Google’s DoubleClick that are capable of  tracking personal 
browsing behavior across thousands of Web sites. Both Web site  publishers and 
the advertising industry defend tracking of individuals across the Web because 
doing so allows more relevant ads to be targeted to users, and it pays for the cost 
of publishing Web sites. In this sense, it’s like broadcast  television: advertiser-sup-
ported content that is free to the user. The  commercial demand for this personal 
 
Chapter 4 Ethical and Social Issues in Information Systems

 information is virtually insatiable. However, these practices also impinge on indi-
vidual privacy, as discussed in the Interactive Session on Technology.
Cookies are small text files deposited on a computer hard drive when a 
user visits Web sites. Cookies identify the visitor’s Web browser software and 
track visits to the Web site. When the visitor returns to a site that has stored 
a cookie, the Web site software will search the visitor’s computer, find the 
cookie, and know what that person has done in the past. It may also update 
the cookie, depending on the activity during the visit. In this way, the site can 
customize its content for each visitor’s interests. For example, if you purchase 
a book on Amazon.com and return later from the same browser, the site will 
welcome you by name and recommend other books of interest based on your 
past purchases. DoubleClick, described earlier in this chapter, uses cookies to 
build its dossiers with details of online  purchases and to examine the behavior 
of Web site visitors. Figure 4.3 illustrates how cookies work.
Web sites using cookie technology cannot directly obtain visitors’ names and 
addresses. However, if a person has registered at a site, that information can be 
combined with cookie data to identify the visitor. Web site owners can also com-
bine the data they have gathered from cookies and other Web site monitoring tools 
with personal data from other sources, such as offline data collected from surveys 
or paper catalog purchases, to develop very detailed profiles of their visitors. 
There are now even more subtle and surreptitious tools for surveillance 
of Internet users. So-called “super cookies” or Flash cookies cannot be easily 
deleted and can be installed whenever a person clicks on a Flash video. These 
so-called “Local Shared Object” files are used by Flash to play videos and are put 
on the user’s computer without their consent. Marketers use Web beacons as 
another tool to monitor online behavior. Web beacons, also called Web bugs (or 
simply “tracking files”), are tiny software programs that keep a record of users’ 
online clickstream and report this data back to whomever owns the tracking 
file invisibly embedded in e-mail messages and Web pages that are designed 
to monitor the behavior of the user visiting a Web site or sending e-mail. Web 
 FIGURE 4.3 
HOW COOKIES IDENTIFY WEB VISITORS
Cookies are written by a Web site on a visitor’s hard drive. When the visitor returns to that Web site, 
the Web server requests the ID number from the cookie and uses it to access the data stored by that 
server on that visitor. The Web site can then use these data to display personalized information.
172 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

Ever get the feeling somebody is trailing you on the 
Web, watching your every click? Do you wonder why 
you start seeing display ads and pop-ups just after 
you’ve been searching the Web for a car, a dress, or 
cosmetic product? Well, you’re right: your behavior is 
being tracked, and you are being targeted on the Web 
as you move from site to site in order to expose you 
to certain “targeted” ads. It’s Big Data’s dark side.
Individual Web sites and companies whose busi-
ness is identifying and tracking Internet users for 
advertisers and marketers are collecting data on 
your every online move. Google, which handles 
more than 3.5 billion Web searches each day, knows 
more about you than your mother does. Many of the 
tracking tools gather incredibly personal informa-
tion such as age, gender, race, income, marital status, 
health concerns (health topics you search on), TV 
shows and movies viewed, magazines and newspa-
pers read, and books purchased. A $31  billion dollar 
online ad industry is driving this intense data col-
lection. Facebook, which maintains detailed data on 
over 1 billion users, employs its Like button to follow 
users around the Web even if you log off. Its social 
networking site is one giant tracking system that 
remembers what you like, what your friends like, 
and whatever you reveal on your Wall. (See the chap-
ter-ending case study.) Plus, Google’s social network-
ing tool, knows about your friendships on Gmail, 
the places you go on maps, and how you spend 
your time on the more than two million  websites in 
Google’s ad network. It is able to gather this informa-
tion even though relatively few people use Plus for 
their social network.
While tracking firms claim the information they 
gather is anonymous, this is true in name only. 
Scholars have shown that with just a few pieces 
of information, such as age, gender, zip code, and 
marital status, specific individuals can be easily 
identified. Moreover, tracking firms combine their 
online data with data they purchase from offline 
firms who track retail store purchases of virtually all 
Americans. Here, personal names and other identi-
fiers are used.
Use of real identities across the Web is going 
mainstream at a rapid clip. A Wall Street Journal 
examination of nearly 1,000 top Websites found that 
75% now include code from social networks, such 
as Facebook’s “Like” or Twitter’s “Tweet” buttons. 
Such code can match people’s identities with their 
 Web-browsing activities on an unprecedented scale 
and can even track a user’s arrival on a page if the 
button is never clicked.
In separate research, the Journal examined what 
happens when people logged in to roughly 70 popu-
lar Websites that request a login and found that more 
than a quarter of the time, the sites passed along a 
user’s real name, email address or other personal 
details to third-party companies. 
Online advertising titans like Google, Microsoft, 
and Yahoo are all looking for ways to monetize 
their huge collections of online behavioral data. 
While search engine marketing is arguably the most 
 effective form of advertising in history, untargeted 
banner display ad marketing is highly inefficient 
because it displays ads to everyone regardless of 
their interests. As a result, these firms cannot charge 
much for display ads. However, by tracking the 
online movements of 245 million U.S. Internet users, 
they can develop a very clear picture of who you are, 
and use that information to show you ads that might 
be of interest to you. This would make the marketing 
process more efficient, and more profitable for all 
the parties involved.
You’re also being tracked closely when you use 
your mobile phone to access the Internet, visit your 
Facebook page, get Twitter feeds, watch video, and 
listen to music. The mobile Web is working hard to 
keep track of your whereabouts, locations, habits, 
and friends in the hope of selling you even more 
products and services. 
New technologies found on smartphones can 
identify where you are located within a few yards. 
Performing routine actions using your smart phone 
makes it possible to locate you throughout the day, 
to report this information to corporate databases, 
retain and analyze the information, and then sell it 
to advertisers. Most of the popular apps report your 
location. Law enforcement agencies certainly have 
an interest in knowing the whereabouts of criminals 
and suspects. There are, of course, many times when 
you would like to report your location either auto-
matically or on your command. If you were injured, 
for instance, you might like your cell phone to be 
able to automatically report your location to authori-
ties, or, if you were in a restaurant, you might want 
to notify your friends where you are and what you

are doing. But what about occasions when you don’t 
want anyone to know where you are, least of all 
advertisers and marketers?
Location data gathered from cell phones has 
extraordinary commercial value because advertising 
companies can send you highly targeted advertise-
ments, coupons, and flash bargains, based on where 
you are located. This technology is the foundation for 
many location-based services, which include smart-
phone maps and charts, shopping apps, and social 
apps that you can use to let your friends know where 
you are and what you are doing. Revenues from the 
global location-based services market are projected to 
reach reach $10.3 billion in 2015, according to Gartner. 
Both Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android 
phones collect personal, private location data, and 
both firms are building massive databases that can 
 pinpoint your location. Advertising firms pay Apple 
and Google for that information and for distributing 
their mobile ads, and they are becoming increas-
ingly important sources of revenue. In 2012, Google

tracking on the Internet?
earned $2.2 billion from its mobile ads. Smartphone 
apps that provide location-based services are also 
sources of personal, private location information 
based on the smartphone GPS capability.
Expect those eyes to follow your movements even 
more in the future as behavioral targeting becomes 
even more precise. New software is being developed 
to help advertisers track users across devices by 
establishing cross-screen identities. That means that 
companies will be able to serve ads to your mobile 
phone based on what they learned about you from 
surfing the Web on your PC.

beacons are placed on popular Web sites by third-party firms who pay the Web 
sites a fee for access to their audience. So how common is Web tracking? In 
a path-breaking series of articles in the Wall Street Journal in 2010 and 2011, 
researchers examined the tracking files on 50 of the most popular U.S Web sites. 
What they found revealed a very widespread surveillance system. On the 50 
sites, they discovered 3,180 tracking files installed on visitor computers. Only 
one site, Wikipedia, had no tracking files. Some popular sites such as Dictionary.
com, MSN, and Comcast, installed more than 100 tracking files! Two-thirds of 
the tracking files came from 131 companies whose primary business is identify-
ing and tracking Internet users to create consumer profiles that can be sold to 
advertising firms looking for specific types of customers. The biggest trackers 
were Google, Microsoft, and Quantcast, all of whom are in the business of sell-
ing ads to advertising firms and marketers. A follow-up study in 2012 found the 
situation had worsened: tracking on the 50 most popular sites had risen nearly 
five fold! The cause: growth of online ad auctions where advertisers buy the 
data about users’ Web browsing behavior.

Web sites to send banner ads and other unsolicited material to the user, and 
it can report the user’s movements on the Internet to other computers. More 
information is available about intrusive software in Chapter 8.
Nearly 80 percent of global Internet users use Google Search and other 
Google  services, making Google the world’s largest collector of online user 
data. Whatever Google does with its data has an enormous impact on online 
privacy. Most experts believe that Google possesses the largest collection 
of personal information in the world—more data on more people than any 
 government agency. The nearest competitor is Facebook. 
After Google acquired the advertising network DoubleClick in 2007, Google 
has been using behavioral targeting to help it display more relevant ads based 
on users’ search  activities and to target individuals as they move from one 
site to another in order to show them display or banner ads. Google allows 
 tracking software on its search pages, and using DoubleClick, it is able to track 
users across the Internet. One of its programs enables advertisers to target 
ads based on the search histories of Google users, along with any other infor-
mation the user  submits to Google such as age, demographics, region, and 
other Web  activities (such as blogging). Google’s AdSense program enables 
Google to help advertisers select  keywords and design ads for various market 
 segments based on search histories, such as helping a clothing Web site create 
and test ads  targeted at teenage females. A recent study found that 88 percent 
of 400,000 Web sites had at least one Google tracking bug.
Google has also been scanning the contents of messages received by users 
of its free Web-based e-mail service called Gmail. Ads that users see when 
they read their e-mail are related to the subjects of these messages. Profiles 
are developed on individual users based on the content in their e-mail. Google 
now displays targeted ads on YouTube and on Google mobile applications, and 
its DoubleClick ad network serves up targeted banner ads.
The United States has allowed businesses to gather transaction information 
generated in the marketplace and then use that information for other market-
ing purposes without obtaining the informed consent of the individual whose 
information is being used. An opt-out model of informed consent permits the 
collection of personal information until the consumer specifically requests 
that the data not be collected. Privacy advocates would like to see wider use of 
an opt-in model of informed consent in which a business is prohibited from 
 collecting any personal information unless the consumer specifically takes 
action to approve information collection and use. Here, the default option is 
no collection of user information. 
The online industry has preferred self-regulation to privacy legislation for 
 protecting consumers. The online advertising industry formed the Online 
Privacy Alliance to  encourage self-regulation to develop a set of privacy guide-
lines for its members. The group promotes the use of online seals, such as 
that of TRUSTe, certifying Web sites adhering to certain privacy principles. 
Members of the advertising network industry, including Google’s DoubleClick, 
have created an additional industry association called the Network Advertising 
Initiative (NAI) to develop its own privacy policies to help consumers opt out 
of advertising network programs and provide consumers redress from abuses. 
Individual firms like Microsoft, Mozilla Foundation, Yahoo, and Google have 
recently adopted policies on their own in an effort to address public  concern 
about tracking people online. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 10 Web browser was 
shipped with the opt-out option as the default in 2013. Other browsers have opt 
out options but users need to turn them on, and most users fail to do this. AOL 
established an  opt-out policy that allows users of its site to not be tracked. Yahoo 
 
Chapter 4 Ethical and Social Issues in Information Systems 
175

follows NAI guidelines and also allows opt-out for tracking and Web  beacons 
(Web bugs). Google has reduced retention time for tracking data.
In general, most Internet businesses do little to protect the privacy of 
their customers, and consumers do not do as much as they should to  protect 
 themselves. For commercial Web sites that depend on advertising to  support 
themselves, most revenue derives from selling customer information. Of 
the companies that do post privacy polices on their Web sites, about half 
do not monitor their sites to ensure they adhere to these policies. The vast 
 majority of online customers claim they are concerned about online privacy, 
but less than half read the privacy statements on Web sites. In general, Web 
site  privacy  policies require a law degree to understand and are ambiguous 
about key terms (Laudon and Traver, 2015). In 2014 what firms like Facebook 
and Google call a “Privacy Policy” is in fact a “Data Use Policy.” The concept 
of  privacy is associated with consumer rights, which firms do not wish to 
 recognize. A Data Use Policy simply tells customers how the information will 
be used without any mention of rights.
In one of the more insightful studies of consumer attitudes towards Internet 
privacy, a group of Berkeley students conducted surveys of online users, and of 
complaints filed with the FTC involving privacy issues. Here are some of their 
results: people feel they have no control over the information collected about 
them, and they don’t know who to complain to. Web sites collect all this informa-
tion, but do not let users have access, the Web site policies are unclear, and they 
share data with “affiliates” but never identify who the affiliates are and how many 
there are. Web bug trackers are ubiquitous and users are not informed of trackers 
on the pages they visit. The results of this study and others  suggest that consum-
ers are not saying “Take my privacy, I don’t care, send me the service for free.” 
They are saying “We want access to the information, we want some controls on 
what can be collected, what is done with the information, the ability to opt out of 
the entire tracking enterprise, and some clarity on what the policies really are, 
and we don’t want those policies changed without our participation and permis-
sion.” (The full report is available at knowprivacy.org.)
Technical Solutions
In addition to legislation, there are a few technologies that can protect user 
privacy  during  interactions with Web sites. Many of these tools are used for 
encrypting e-mail, for  making e-mail or surfing activities appear anonymous, 
for preventing client computers from  accepting cookies, or for detecting and 
eliminating spyware. For the most part, technical solutions have failed to 
 protect users from being tracked as they move from one site to another. 
Because of growing public criticism of behavioral tracking, targeting of ads, 
and the failure of industry to self-regulate, attention has shifted to browsers. 
Many browsers have Do Not Track options. For users who have selected the Do 
Not Track browser option, their browser will send a request to Web sites request-
ing the user’s behavior not be tracked. But Web sites are not obligated to honor 
their visitors’ requests not to be tracked. There is no online advertising industry 
agreement on how to respond to Do Not Track requests, and  currently no legisla-
tion requiring Web sites to stop tracking.
PROPERTY RIGHTS: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Contemporary information systems have severely challenged exist-
ing laws and social  practices that protect private intellectual property. 
Intellectual property is considered to be intangible property created by 
176 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

individuals or  corporations. Information technology has made it difficult to 
protect  intellectual property because computerized information can be so 
easily copied or distributed on networks. Intellectual property is subject to 
a variety of  protections under three different legal traditions: trade secrets, 
copyright, and patent law.
Trade Secrets
Any intellectual work product—a formula, device, pattern, or compilation of 
data—used for a business purpose can be classified as a trade secret, pro-
vided it is not based on  information in the public domain. Protections for 
trade secrets vary from state to state. In general, trade secret laws grant a 
monopoly on the ideas behind a work product, but it can be a very tenuous 
monopoly.
Software that contains novel or unique elements, procedures, or compila-
tions can be included as a trade secret. Trade secret law protects the actual 
ideas in a work product, not only their manifestation. To make this claim, 
the creator or owner must take care to bind employees and customers with 
 nondisclosure agreements and to prevent the secret from  falling into the 
public domain.
The limitation of trade secret protection is that, although virtually all  software 
programs of any complexity contain unique elements of some sort, it is difficult 
to prevent the ideas in the work from falling into the public domain when the 
software is widely distributed.
Copyright
Copyright is a statutory grant that protects creators of intellectual property from 
having their work copied by others for any purpose during the life of the author 
plus an additional 70 years after the author’s death. For corporate-owned works, 
copyright protection lasts for 95 years after their initial creation. Congress has 
extended copyright protection to books, periodicals, lectures,  dramas, musical 
compositions, maps, drawings, artwork of any kind, and motion pictures. The 
intent behind copyright laws has been to encourage  creativity and authorship 
by ensuring that creative people receive the financial and other benefits of 
their work. Most industrial nations have their own  copyright laws, and there 
are several  international conventions and bilateral agreements through which 
nations coordinate and enforce their laws.
In the mid-1960s, the Copyright Office began registering software programs, 
and in 1980, Congress passed the Computer Software Copyright Act, which 
clearly provides  protection for software program code and for copies of the 
 original sold in commerce, and sets forth the rights of the purchaser to use the 
software while the creator retains legal title.
Copyright protects against copying of entire programs or their parts. Damages 
and relief are readily obtained for infringement. The drawback to copyright 
protection is that the underlying ideas behind a work are not  protected, only 
their manifestation in a work. A competitor can use your  software, understand 
how it works, and build new software that follows the same concepts without 
infringing on a copyright.
“Look and feel” copyright infringement lawsuits are precisely about the 
 distinction between an idea and its expression. For instance, in the early 1990s, 
Apple Computer sued Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard for infringe-
ment of the expression of Apple’s Macintosh interface, claiming that the defen-
dants copied the expression of overlapping  windows. The defendants  countered 
that the idea of overlapping windows can be expressed only in a  single way 
 
Chapter 4 Ethical and Social Issues in Information Systems 
177

and, therefore, was not protectable under the merger  doctrine of  copyright law. 
When ideas and their expression merge, the expression cannot be copyrighted. 
In general, courts appear to be following the reasoning of a 1989 case—Brown 
Bag Software v. Symantec Corp—in which the court dissected the elements of 
software alleged to be infringing. The court found that similar concept,  function, 
general functional features (e.g., drop-down menus), and colors are not protect-
able by copyright law (Brown Bag Software v. Symantec Corp., 1992).
Patents
A patent grants the owner an exclusive monopoly on the ideas behind an inven-
tion for 20 years. The congressional intent behind patent law was to ensure 
that inventors of new machines, devices, or methods receive the full financial 
and other rewards of their labor and yet make widespread use of the invention 
 possible by providing detailed diagrams for those wishing to use the idea under 
license from the patent’s owner. The granting of a patent is determined by the 
United States Patent and Trademark Office and relies on court rulings.
The key concepts in patent law are originality, novelty, and invention. The 
Patent Office did not accept applications for software patents routinely until a 
1981 Supreme Court  decision that held that computer programs could be a part 
of a patentable process. Since that time, hundreds of patents have been granted 
and thousands await consideration. 
The strength of patent protection is that it grants a monopoly on the underly-
ing concepts and ideas of software. The difficulty is passing stringent criteria 
of nonobviousness (e.g., the work must reflect some special understanding and 
contribution), originality, and novelty, as well as years of waiting to receive 
 protection.
In what some call the patent trial of the century, in 2011, Apple sued 
Samsung for violating its patents for iPhones, iPads, and iPods. On August 24, 
2012, a California jury in federal district court delivered a decisive  victory to 
Apple and a stunning defeat to Samsung. The jury awarded Apple $1 billion 
in  damages. The decision established criteria for determining just how close 
a competitor can come to an industry-leading and standard-setting product 
like Apple’s iPhone before it violates the design and utility patents of the 
leading firm. The same court ruled that Samsung could not sell its new 
tablet computer (Galaxy 10.1) in the United States. In a later patent dis-
pute, Samsung won an infringement case against Apple. In June 2013, the 
United States International Trade Commission issued a ban for a handful of 
older iPhone and iPad devices because they violated Samsun patents from 
years ago. In 2014 Apple sued Samsung again, claiming infringement of five 
patents. The patents cover  hardware and software techniques for handling 
photos, videos, and lists used on the popular Galaxy 5. Apple is seeking $2 
billion in damages. 
To make matters more complicated, Apple has been one of Samsung’s  largest 
customers for flash memory processors, graphic chips, solid-state drives and 
 display parts that are used in Apple’s iPhones, iPads, iPod Touch devices, and 
MacBooks. The Samsung and Apple patent cases are indicative of the  complex 
relationships among the leading computer firms.
Challenges to Intellectual Property Rights
Contemporary information technologies, especially software, pose severe 
 challenges to existing intellectual property regimes and, therefore, create 
 significant ethical, social, and political issues. Digital media differ from books, 
periodicals, and other media in terms of ease of replication; ease of transmission; 
178 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

ease of alteration; difficulty in classifying a  software work as a program, book, 
or even music; compactness—making theft easy; and difficulties in establishing 
uniqueness.
The proliferation of electronic networks, including the Internet, has made it 
even more difficult to protect intellectual property. Before widespread use of 
 networks, copies of  software, books, magazine articles, or films had to be stored 
on physical media, such as paper, computer disks, or videotape, creating some 
hurdles to distribution. Using networks, information can be more widely repro-
duced and distributed. The Ninth Annual Global Software Piracy Study  conducted 
by International Data Corporation and the Business Software Alliance reported 
that the rate of global software piracy climbed to 42 percent in 2013, representing 
$73 billion in global losses from software piracy. Worldwide, for every $100 worth 
of legitimate software sold that year, an additional $75 worth was obtained  illegally 
(Business Software Alliance, 2014).
The Internet was designed to transmit information freely around the world, 
including copyrighted information. With the World Wide Web in particular, you 
can easily copy and distribute virtually anything to thousands and even  millions 
of people around the world, even if they are using different types of computer 
 systems. Information can be illicitly  copied from one place and  distributed through 
other systems and networks even though these parties do not willingly participate 
in the infringement. 
Individuals have been illegally copying and distributing digitized music files 
on the Internet for several decades. File-sharing services such as Napster, and 
later Grokster, Kazaa, and Morpheus, Megaupload, The Pirate Bay, sprung up 
to help users locate and swap digital music and video files, including those 
 protected by copyright. Illegal file sharing became so widespread that it threat-
ened the viability of the music recording industry and, at one point, consumed 
20  percent of Internet bandwidth. The recording industry won several legal 
battles for shutting these services down, but it has not been able to halt illegal 
file sharing entirely. The motion picture and cable television industries are 
waging similar battles, as described in the chapter-opening case study. Several 
European nations have worked with U.S. authorities to shut down illegal sharing 
sites, with mixed results. In France, illegal downloaders can lose access to the 
Internet for a year or more.
As legitimate online music stores like the iTunes Store expanded, and more 
recently as Internet radio services like Pandora expanded, some forms of  illegal 
file sharing have declined. Technology has radically altered the prospects for 
 intellectual property protection from theft, at least for music, videos, and televi-
sion shows (less so for software). The Apple iTunes Store legitimated paying for 
music and entertainment, and created a closed environment where music and 
videos could not be easily copied and widely distributed unless played on Apple 
devices. Amazon’s Kindle also  protects the rights of publishers and writers because 
its books cannot be copied to the Internet and distributed. Streaming of Internet 
radio, on services such as Pandora and Spotify, and Hollywood movies (at sites 
such as Hulu and Netflix) also inhibits piracy because the streams cannot be easily 
recorded on separate devices and videos can be downloaded so easily. Moreover, 
the large Web distributors like Apple, Google, and Amazon do not want to encour-
age piracy in music or videos simply because they need these properties to earn 
revenue. 
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 also 
 provides some  copyright protection. The DMCA implemented a World 
Intellectual Property Organization Treaty that makes it illegal to circum-
vent technology-based protections of copyrighted materials. Internet service

providers (ISPs) are required to take down sites of copyright  infringers they 
are hosting once the ISPs are notified of the problem. Microsoft and other 
major software and information content firms are represented by the Software 
and Information Industry Association (SIIA), which lobbies for new laws and 
enforcement of existing laws to protect intellectual property around the world. 
The SIIA runs an antipiracy hotline for  individuals to report piracy activities, 
offers educational programs to help organizations combat  software piracy, and 
has published guidelines for employee use of software.

HOW HAVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AFFECTED 
LAWS FOR ESTABLISHING ACCOUNTABILITY, 
LIABILITY, AND THE QUALITY OF EVERYDAY LIFE?
Along with privacy and property laws, new information technologies are 
 challenging  existing liability laws and social practices for holding individuals 
and institutions  accountable. If a person is injured by a machine controlled, in 
part, by software, who should be held  accountable and, therefore, held liable? 
Should a social network site like Facebook or Twitter be held liable and account-
able for the posting of pornographic material or racial insults, or should they 
be held harmless against any liability for what users post (as is true of common 
carriers, such as the telephone system)? What about the Internet? If you out-
source your information processing, to the Cloud, and the Cloud provider fails 
to provide adequate service, what can you do? Cloud providers often claim the 
software you are using is the problem, not the Cloud servers. Some real-world 
examples may shed light on these questions.
COMPUTER-RELATED LIABILITY PROBLEMS
In the final days of the 2013 holiday shopping season, Target, one of the largest 
U.S. retailers, confirmed publicly that credit and debit card information for 40 
million of its customers had been compromised. A few weeks later, the com-
pany said additional personal information, like email and mailing addresses, 
from some 70 to 110 million customers, had been exposed as well. In the mean-
time, security analysts noticed a huge spike in the number of credit card num-
bers for sale on hacker Web sites. Target’s sales took an immediate hit from 
which it has still not recovered. The company claims that east European hack-
ers entered their point of sale systems by using brute force techniques to crack 
their security. Federal officials believe that six other large retailers also were 
hacked by the same group, including Nieman Marcus. Later in 2014, Target’s 
senior technology officer resigned from Target. Target says it has spent over $60 
million to strengthen its systems. It has paid an even greater price through the 
loss of sales and trust. (You can find out more about Target’s hacking problems 
in the Chapter 8 Interactive Session on Management.)
Who is liable for any economic harm caused to individuals or businesses 
that had their credit cards compromised? Is Target responisble for allowing the 
breach to occur despite efforts it did make to secure the information? Or is this 
just a cost of doing business in a credit card world where customers and busi-
nesses have insurance policies to protect them against losses? Customers, for 
instance, have a maximum liability of $50 for credit card theft under federal 
banking law.
180 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

This case reveals the difficulties faced by information systems executives 
who  ultimately are responsible for any harm done by systems they have 
selected and installed. Beyond IT managers, insofar as computer  software 
is part of a machine, and the machine injures someone  physically or 
 economically, the producer of the software and the operator can be held liable 
for damages. Insofar as the software acts like a book, storing and  displaying 
information, courts have been reluctant to hold authors,  publishers, and 
booksellers liable for contents (the exception being instances of fraud or 
defamation), and hence courts have been wary of holding software authors 
liable for software.
In general, it is very difficult (if not impossible) to hold software producers 
liable for their software products that are considered to be like books, regardless 
of the physical or economic harm that results. Historically, print publishers of 
books and periodicals have not been held liable because of fears that liability 
claims would interfere with First Amendment rights guaranteeing freedom of 
expression. And the kind of harm caused by software failures is rarely fatal and 
typically inconveniences users but does not physically harm them (the excep-
tion being medical devices). 
What about software as a service? ATM machines are a service provided to 
bank  customers. Should this service fail, customers will be inconvenienced and 
perhaps harmed economically if they cannot access their funds in a timely 
manner. Should  liability  protections be extended to software publishers and 
operators of defective financial,  accounting,  simulation, or marketing systems?
Software is very different from books. Software users may develop expecta-
tions of infallibility about software; software is less easily inspected than a book, 
and it is more difficult to compare with other software products for quality; 
 software claims to perform a task rather than describe a task, as a book does; 
and people come to depend on services essentially based on software. Given 
the centrality of software to everyday life, the chances are excellent that liability 
law will extend its reach to include software even when the software merely 
 provides an information service.
Telephone systems have not been held liable for the messages transmitted 
because they are regulated common carriers. In return for their right to pro-
vide telephone service, they must provide access to all, at reasonable rates, and 
achieve acceptable reliability. But  broadcasters and cable television stations are 
subject to a wide variety of federal and local constraints on content and facilities. 
In the United States, with few exceptions, Web sites are not held liable for con-
tent posted on their sites regardless if it was placed their by the Web site owners 
or users.
SYSTEM QUALITY: DATA QUALITY AND SYSTEM 
ERRORS
White Christmas turned into a black out for millions of Netflix customers, and 
social network users, on December 25th, 2012. The blackout was caused by 
the failure of Amazon’s cloud computing service, which provides storage and 
computing power for all kinds of Web sites and services, including Netflix. The 
loss of service lasted for a day. Amazon blamed it on “Elastic Load Balancing,” 
a software program that balances the loads on all its cloud servers to prevent 
overload. Amazon’s cloud computing services have had several subsequent 
outages, although not as long-lasting as the Christmas Eve outage. Outages 
at cloud computing services are rare, but are recurring. These outages have 
 
Chapter 4 Ethical and Social Issues in Information Systems 
181

called into question the reliability and quality of cloud services. Are these 
 outages acceptable?
The debate over liability and accountability for unintentional consequences of 
system use raises a related but independent moral dimension: What is an accept-
able, technologically feasible level of system quality? At what point should  system 
managers say, “Stop  testing, we’ve done all we can to perfect this  software. Ship 
it!” Individuals and organizations may be held responsible for avoidable and fore-
seeable consequences, which they have a duty to  perceive and correct. The gray 
area is that some system errors are  foreseeable and  correctable only at very great 
expense, an expense so great that pursuing this level of  perfection is not feasible 
economically—no one could afford the product. 
For example, although software companies try to debug their products 
before releasing them to the marketplace, they knowingly ship buggy prod-
ucts because the time and cost of fixing all minor errors would prevent these 
 products from ever being released. What if the product was not offered on the 
marketplace, would social welfare as a whole not advance and perhaps even 
decline? Carrying this further, just what is the responsibility of a producer of 
computer services—should it withdraw the product that can never be perfect, 
warn the user, or forget about the risk (let the buyer beware)?
Three principal sources of poor system performance are (1) software bugs 
and errors, (2) hardware or facility failures caused by natural or other causes, 
and (3) poor input data quality. A Chapter 8 Learning Track discusses why zero 
defects in software code of any complexity cannot be achieved and why the 
seriousness of remaining bugs cannot be  estimated. Hence, there is a techno-
logical barrier to perfect software, and users must be aware of the potential 
for catastrophic failure. The software industry has not yet arrived at testing 
 standards for producing software of acceptable but im perfect performance.
Although software bugs and facility catastrophes are likely to be widely 
reported in the press, by far the most common source of business system 
 failure is data quality. Few  companies routinely measure the quality of their 
data, but individual organizations report data error rates ranging from 0.5 to 
30 percent.
QUALITY OF LIFE: EQUITY, ACCESS, AND BOUNDARIES
The negative social costs of introducing information technologies and sys-
tems are  beginning to mount along with the power of the technology. Many 
of these negative social consequences are not violations of individual rights or 
property crimes. Nevertheless, these negative  consequences can be extremely 
harmful to individuals, societies, and  political  institutions. Computers and 
information technologies potentially can destroy valuable  elements of our 
culture and  society even while they bring us  benefits. If there is a balance of 
good and bad consequences of using information  systems, who do we hold 
responsible for the bad  consequences? Next, we briefly examine some of the 
negative social consequences of systems, considering individual, social, and 
political responses.
Balancing Power: Center Versus Periphery
An early fear of the computer age was that huge, centralized mainframe 
 computers would centralize power in the nation’s capital, resulting in a Big 
Brother society, as was  suggested in George Orwell’s novel 1984. The shift 
toward highly decentralized client-server computing,  coupled with an ideology 
of empowerment of Twitter and social media users, and the  decentralization 
182 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

of  decision making to lower organizational levels, up until recently reduced 
the fears of power  centralization in  government institutions. Yet much of the 
empowerment described in popular business  magazines is trivial. Lower-level 
employees may be empowered to make minor decisions, but the key policy 
decisions may be as centralized as in the past. At the same time, corporate 
Internet behemoths like Google, Apple, Yahoo, Amazon, and Microsoft have 
come to  dominate the collection and analysis of personal private information 
of all citizens. Since the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 
11, 2001, the federal government has greatly expanded its use of this private 
sector information, as well as other forms of digital communication, in pursuit 
of national security. In this sense, power has become more centralized into the 
hands of a few private oligopolies and large government agencies.
Rapidity of Change: Reduced Response Time to 
Competition
Information systems have helped to create much more efficient national and 
international markets. Today’s more efficient global marketplace has reduced 
the normal social buffers that permitted businesses many years to adjust to 
competition. Time-based competition has an ugly side: The business you work 
for may not have enough time to respond to global  competitors and may be 
wiped out in a year, along with your job. We stand the risk of developing a “just-
in-time society” with “just-in-time jobs” and “just-in-time” workplaces, families, 
and vacations.
Maintaining Boundaries: Family, Work, and Leisure
Parts of this book were produced on trains and planes, as well as on vacations 
and  during what otherwise might have been “family” time. The danger to ubiq-
uitous computing,  telecommuting, nomad computing, mobile computing, 
and the “do anything anywhere” computing  environment is that it is actually 
coming true. The  traditional boundaries that separate work from family and 
just plain leisure have been weakened. 
Although authors have traditionally worked just about anywhere, the advent 
of information  systems, coupled with the growth of knowledge-work occupa-
tions, means that more and more people are working when  traditionally they 
would have been playing or communicating with family and friends. The work 
umbrella now extends far beyond the eight-hour day into commuting time, 
vacation time, and leisure time. The explosive growth and use of smart phones 
has only heightened the sense of many employees that they are never “away 
from work.”
Even leisure time spent on the computer threatens these close social 
 relationships. Extensive Internet and cell phone use, even for entertainment or 
recreational purposes, takes people away from their family and friends. Among 
middle school and teenage children, it can lead to harmful anti-social behavior, 
such as the recent upsurge in cyberbullying. 
Weakening these institutions poses clear-cut risks. Family and friends histori-
cally have provided powerful support mechanisms for individuals, and they act 
as balance points in a society by preserving private life, providing a place for 
people to collect their thoughts, allowing people to think in ways contrary to their 
employer, and dream.
Dependence and Vulnerability
Today, our businesses, governments, schools, and private associations, 
such as churches, are incredibly dependent on information systems and 
 
Chapter 4 Ethical and Social Issues in Information Systems 
183

are,  therefore, highly vulnerable if these systems fail. Secondary schools, 
for instance, increasingly use and rely on educational software. Test results 
are often stored off campus. If these systems were to shut down, there is 
no backup educational structure or content that can make up for the loss of 
the system. With systems now as ubiquitous as the telephone system, it is 
 startling to remember that there are no regulatory or standard-setting forces 
in place that are similar to telephone, electrical, radio, television, or other 
public utility technologies. The absence of standards and the criticality of 
some system applications will probably call forth demands for national stan-
dards and perhaps regulatory oversight.
Computer Crime and Abuse
New technologies, including computers, create new opportunities for commit-
ting crime by creating new valuable items to steal, new ways to steal them, 
and new ways to harm  others. Computer crime is the commission of illegal 
acts through the use of a computer or against a computer system. Computers 
or computer  systems can be the object of the crime ( destroying a company’s 
computer center or a company’s computer files), as well as the instrument of a 
crime (stealing computer lists by illegally gaining access to a computer system 
using a home computer). Simply accessing a computer system without autho-
rization or with intent to do harm, even by accident, is now a federal crime. 
How common is  computer crime? One source of information is the Internet 
Crime Complaint Center (“IC3”), a partnership between the National White 
Collar Crime Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The IC3 data is 
useful for gauging the types of e-commerce crimes most likely to be reported 
by consumers. In 2012, the IC3 processed about 290,000 Internet crime com-
plaints, the second-highest number in its 11-year history. Over half the complain-
ants reported a financial loss, with the total reported amount at $525 million. 
The average amount of loss for those who reported a financial loss was more

anywhere” computing

than $4,573. The most common complaints were for scams involving the FBI, 
 identity theft, and advance fee fraud (National White Collar Crime Center and 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2013). The Computer Security Institute’s 
annual Computer Crime and Security Survey is another source of information. In 
2011, its most recent report, the survey was based on the responses of 351 secu-
rity practitioners in U.S. corporations, government agencies, financial institu-
tions, medical institutions, and universities. The survey reported that 46 percent 
of responding organizations experienced a computer security incident within 
the past year. The most common type of attack experienced was a malware 
infection (67%), followed by phishing fraud (39%), laptop and mobile hardware 
theft (34%), attacks by botnets (29%), and insider abuse (25%). The true cost of 
all computer crime is  estimated to be in the billions of dollars. On average, the 
cost to a firm of a single computer crime averages about $8.9 million (Ponemon 
Institute, 2012).
Computer abuse is the commission of acts involving a computer that may 
not be  illegal but that are considered unethical. The popularity of the Internet 
and e-mail has turned one form of computer abuse—spamming—into a serious 
problem for both individuals and  businesses. Originally, Spam is junk e-mail 
sent by an organization or individual to a mass audience of Internet users 
who have expressed no interest in the product or service being marketed. But 
as cell phone use has mushroomed, spam was certain to follow. Identity and 
financial theft cyber criminals are turning their attention to smart phones as 
users check mail, do online banking, pay bills, and reveal personal informa-
tion. Cell phone spam usually comes in the form of SMS text messages, but 
increasingly users are receiving spam in their Facebook Newsfeed and mes-
saging service as well. Verizon estimates that it blocks about 200 million spam 
messages a month using its filters and security checks. Spammers tend to 
 market pornography, fraudulent deals and services, outright scams, and other 
products not widely approved in most civilized societies. Some countries have 
passed laws to outlaw  spamming or to restrict its use. In the United States, it is 
still legal if it does not involve fraud and the sender and subject of the e-mail 
are properly identified.
Spamming has mushroomed because it costs only a few cents to send 
 thousands of  messages advertising wares to Internet users. The percentage of 
all e-mail that is spam was estimated at around 66 percent in 2014 (Symantec, 
2014). Most spam originates from bot networks, which consist of thousands 
of  captured PCs that can initiate and relay spam  messages. Spam volume has 
declined  somewhat since authorities took down the Rustock botnet in 2011. 
Spam is seasonally cyclical, and varies monthly due to the impact of new 
 technologies (both supportive and discouraging of spammers), new prosecu-
tions, and  seasonal demand for  products and services. Spam costs for  businesses 
are very high (estimated at over $50 billion per year) because of the  computing 
and  network resources consumed by billions of unwanted e-mail messages and 
the time required to deal with them. 
Internet service providers and individuals can combat spam by using spam 
filtering software to block suspicious e-mail before it enters a recipient’s e-mail 
inbox. However, spam filters may block legitimate messages. Spammers know 
how to skirt around  filters by continually changing their e-mail accounts, by 
incorporating spam messages in images, by embedding spam in e-mail attach-
ments and electronic greeting cards, and by using other people’s computers 
that have been hijacked by botnets (see Chapter 8). Many spam  messages are 
sent from one country while another country hosts the spam Web site. 
 
Chapter 4 Ethical and Social Issues in Information Systems 
185

Spamming is more tightly regulated in Europe than in the United States. 
In 2002, the European Parliament passed a ban on unsolicited commercial 
 messaging. Electronic  marketing can be targeted only to people who have given 
prior consent. 
The U.S. CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, which went into effect in 2004, does not 
 outlaw spamming but does ban deceptive e-mail practices by requiring com-
mercial e-mail  messages to display accurate subject lines, identify the true 
senders, and offer recipients an easy way to remove their names from e-mail 
lists. It also prohibits the use of fake return addresses. A few people have 
been prosecuted under the law, but it has had a negligible impact on spam-
ming in large part because of the Internet’s  exceptionally poor security and 
the use of offshore servers and botnets. In 2008, Robert Soloway, the so-called 
Seattle “Spam King,” was sentenced to 47 months in prison for sending over 90 
 million spam  messages in just three months off two servers. In 2011, the so-
called Facebook “Spam King,” Sanford Wallace, was indicted for sending over 
27 million spam messages to Facebook users. He is facing a 40-year sentence 
because of prior  spamming convictions. In 2014 most large scale spamming 
has moved offshore to Russia and Eastern Europe where hackers control global 
botnets capable of generating billions of spam messages. The largest spam net-
work in 2013 was the Russian network Festi based in St. Petersburg. Festi is best 
known as the spam generator behind the global Viagra-spam industry which 
stretches from Russia to Indian pharmaceutical firms selling counterfeit Viagra. 
The spam industry in Russia generates an estimated $60 million for criminal 
groups (Kramer, 2013). 
Employment: Trickle-Down Technology and 
Reengineering Job Loss
Reengineering work is typically hailed in the information systems community 
as a major benefit of new information technology. It is much less frequently 
noted that  redesigning  business processes has caused millions of mid-level 
factory  managers, and clerical workers to lose their jobs. One economist has 
raised the possibility that we will create a society run by a small “high tech elite 
of corporate professionals . . . in a nation of the permanently  unemployed” 
(Rifkin, 1993). In 2011, some economists have sounded new alarms about 
information and computer technology threatening middle-class, white-collar 
jobs (in  addition to blue- collar factory jobs). Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew 
P. McAfee argue that the pace of automation has picked up in recent years 
because of a combination of technologies including  robotics, numerically con-
trolled machines, computerized inventory control, pattern recognition, voice 
recognition, and online commerce. One result is that machines can now do a 
great many jobs heretofore reserved for humans including tech support, call 
center work, X-ray examiners, and even legal document review (Brynjolfsson 
and McAfee, 2011). These views contrast with earlier assessments by econo-
mists that both labor and capital would receive stable shares of income, and 
that new technologies created as many or more new jobs as they destroyed 
old ones. But there is no guarantee this will happen in the future, and the 
income wealth share of labor may continue to fall relative to capital, resulting 
in a loss of high paying jobs and further declines in wages. 
Other economists are much more sanguine about the potential job losses. 
They believe relieving bright, educated workers from reengineered jobs 
will result in these workers moving to better jobs in fast-growth industries. 
Missing from this equation are unskilled, blue-collar workers and older, 
186 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

less well-educated middle managers. It is not clear that these groups can be 
retrained easily for high-quality (high-paying) jobs.
Equity and Access: Increasing Racial and Social Class 
Cleavages
Does everyone have an equal opportunity to participate in the digital age? Will 
the social, economic, and cultural gaps that exist in the United States and other 
societies be reduced by information systems technology? Or will the cleavages 
be increased, permitting the better off to become even more better off relative 
to others? 
These questions have not yet been fully answered because the impact of 
 systems  technology on various groups in society has not been thoroughly 
 studied. What is known is that information, knowledge, computers, and access 
to these resources through  educational institutions and public libraries are 
inequitably distributed along ethnic and social class lines, as are many other 
information resources. Several studies have found that poor and minority 
groups in the United States are less likely to have computers or online Internet 
access even though computer ownership and Internet access have soared in 
the past five years. Although the gap is narrowing, higher-income families in 
each ethnic group are still more likely to have home computers and Internet 
access than lower-income families in the same group.
A similar digital divide exists in U.S. schools, with schools in high-pov-
erty areas less likely to have computers, high-quality educational technology 
 programs, or Internet access availability for their students. Left uncorrected, 
the digital divide could lead to a society of information haves, computer  literate 
and skilled, versus a large group of information  have-nots, computer illiter-
ate and unskilled. Public interest groups want to narrow this  digital divide 
by  making digital information services—including the Internet—available to 
 virtually everyone, just as basic telephone service is now.
Health Risks: RSI, CVS, and Technostress
A common occupational disease today is repetitive stress injury (RSI). RSI 
occurs when muscle groups are forced through repetitive actions often with 
high-impact loads (such as tennis) or tens of thousands of repetitions under 
low-impact loads (such as working at a computer keyboard). The incidence 
of repetitive stress syndrome is estimated to be 3% to 6% of the workforce 
(LeBlanc and Cestia, 2011). 
The single largest source of RSI is computer keyboards. The most common 
kind of  computer-related RSI is carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), in which 
 pressure on the median nerve through the wrist’s bony structure, called a 
carpal tunnel, produces pain. The  pressure is caused by constant repetition of 
keystrokes: in a single shift, a word processor may  perform 23,000 keystrokes. 
Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numbness,  shooting pain, inabil-
ity to grasp objects, and tingling. Millions of workers have been diagnosed with 
carpal tunnel syndrome.
RSI is avoidable. Designing workstations for a neutral wrist position (using 
a wrist rest to support the wrist), proper monitor stands, and footrests all 
 contribute to proper posture and reduced RSI. Ergonomically correct keyboards 
are also an option. These measures should be supported by frequent rest breaks 
and rotation of employees to different jobs. 
RSI is not the only occupational illness computers cause. Back and neck pain, 
leg stress, and foot pain also result from poor ergonomic designs of  workstations. 
 
Chapter 4 Ethical and Social Issues in Information Systems 
187

Computer vision syndrome (CVS) refers to any eyestrain condition related 
to display screen use in desktop computers, laptops, e-readers, smartphones, 
and handheld video games. CVS affects about 90 percent of people who spend 
three hours or more per day at a computer (Beck, 2010). Its symptoms, which 
are usually  temporary, include headaches, blurred vision, and dry and irritated 
eyes.
The newest computer-related malady is technostress, which is stress 
induced by  computer and cell phone use. Its symptoms include aggrava-
tion, hostility toward humans, impatience, and fatigue. According to experts, 
humans working  continuously with computers come to expect other humans 
and human institutions to behave like computers, providing instant responses, 
attentiveness, and an absence of emotion. Technostress is thought to be related 
to high levels of job turnover in the computer industry, high levels of early 
retirement from  computer-intense occupations, and elevated levels of drug and 
alcohol abuse.
The incidence of technostress is not known but is thought to be in the 
 millions and  growing in the United States. Computer-related jobs now top the 
list of stressful occupations based on health  statistics in several industrialized 
countries. 
In addition to these maladies, computer technology may be harming our 
 cognitive  functions or at least changing how we think and solve problems. 
Although the Internet has made it much easier for people to access, create, and 
use information, some experts believe that it is also  preventing people from 
focusing and thinking clearly. 
The computer has become a part of our lives—personally as well as socially, 
 culturally, and politically. It is unlikely that the issues and our choices will 
become easier as  information technology continues to transform our world. 
The growth of the Internet and the  information economy suggests that all the 
ethical and social issues we have described will be heightened further as we 
move into the first digital century.
Repetitive stress injury 
(RSI) is the leading 
 occupational disease today. 
The  single largest cause of 
RSI is computer keyboard 
work.

Review Summary
1. What ethical, social, and political issues are raised by information systems? 
Information technology is introducing changes for which laws and rules of acceptable conduct have 
not yet been developed. Increasing computing power, storage, and networking capabilities—including 
the Internet—expand the reach of individual and organizational actions and magnify their impacts. 
The ease and anonymity with which information is now communicated, copied, and manipulated in 
online environments pose new challenges to the protection of privacy and intellectual property. The 
main ethical, social, and political issues raised by information systems center around information 
rights and obligations, property rights and obligations, accountability and control, system quality, and 
quality of life.
2. What specific principles for conduct can be used to guide ethical decisions? 
Six ethical principles for judging conduct include the Golden Rule, Immanuel Kant’s Categorical 
Imperative, Descartes’ rule of change, the Utilitarian Principle, the Risk Aversion Principle, and the 
ethical “no free lunch” rule. These principles should be used in conjunction with an ethical analysis. 
3. Why do contemporary information systems technology and the Internet pose challenges to the 
 protection of individual privacy and intellectual property? 
Contemporary data storage and data analysis technology enables companies to easily gather 
 personal data about individuals from many different sources and analyze these data to  create detailed 
electronic profiles about individuals and their behaviors. Data flowing over the Internet can be 
 monitored at many points. Cookies and other Web monitoring tools closely track the activities of Web 
site visitors. Not all Web sites have strong privacy protection policies, and they do not always allow for 
informed consent regarding the use of personal information. Traditional copyright laws are  insufficient 
to protect against software piracy because digital material can be copied so easily and transmitted to 
many different locations simultaneously over the Internet.
4. How have information systems affected  laws for establishing accountability, liability, and the quality 
of everyday life?
New information technologies are challenging existing liability laws and social practices for holding 
individuals and institutions accountable for harm done to others.  Although computer systems have been 
sources of efficiency and wealth, they have some negative impacts. Computer errors can cause serious 
harm to individuals and organizations. Poor data quality is also responsible for disruptions and losses for 
businesses. Jobs can be lost when computers replace workers or tasks become unnecessary in 
 reengineered business processes. The ability to own and use a computer may be exacerbating 
 socioeconomic disparities among different racial groups and social classes. Widespread use of computers 
increases opportunities for computer crime and computer abuse. Computers can also create health 
 problems, such as repetitive stress injury, computer vision syndrome, and technostress.

Management Decision Problems

The Malaysian government is a major healthcare provider. The government It plans to have 33 paperless 
public hospitals in Malaysia in the next few years. These paperless hospitals will be enabled backed by 
information systems that will collect, process, and retrieve data. This will not only help to increase  the 
operating efficiency of these hospitals but will also be environment-friendly. Until recently, Till now, the 
government has been successful in making two public hospitals paperless, and they are working with the 
work on other 31 hospitals to transform them into paperless hospitals is in progress. Although the govern-
ment has formulated a code of conduct for doctors to be good practitioners, there is no code in place for 
information ethics. There is an urgent need to regulate the collection, storage, processing and communi-
cation of medical data and patient information to prevent misuse. What concerns might patients have? 
What can hospitals do to prevent misuse? Given the scenario outlined above, what do you think should be 
part of an ethical code of conduct for securing the sensitive information gathered by healthcare service 
providers?

As the head of a small insurance company with six employees, you are  concerned about how effectively 
your company is using its networking and human resources. Budgets are tight, and you are struggling to 
meet payrolls because employees are reporting many overtime hours. You do not believe that the 
employees have a sufficiently heavy work load to warrant working longer hours and are looking into the 
amount of time they spend on the Internet.
 
 Each employee uses a computer with Internet access on the job. Review a sample of your company’s 
weekly report of employee Web usage, which can be found in MyMISLab™.
• Calculate the total amount of time each employee spent on the Web for the week and the total amount 
of time that company computers were used for this purpose. Rank the employees in the order of the 
amount of time each spent online. 
• Do your findings and the contents of the report indicate any ethical  problems employees are creating? 
Is the company creating an ethical  problem by monitoring its employees’ use of the Internet? 
• Use the guidelines for ethical analysis presented in this chapter to develop a  solution to the problems 
you have identified.

follow the instructions to create a blog. Give your blog a suitable name; choose a template and a back-
ground image.  Create a blog that reports on non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  NGOs are organi-
zations that are not associated with a specific government, and they are non-profit.  Generally, NGOs are 
privately funded and engage in charitable activities throughout the world.   Search the Internet for differ-
ent NGOs and charity organizations operating in Southeast Asia. Categorise the NGOs based on their 
operations and post this information on your blog. Also use blogging controls available to grant access to 
different users to comment on your blog. How could your blog help to motivate students to volunteer at

Facebook Privacy: There Is No Privacy
CASE STUDY
O
ver the course of less than a decade, 
Facebook has morphed from a small, 
niche networking site for mostly Ivy 
League college students into a publicly 
traded company with a market worth of $148 billion 
in 2014 (up from $59 billion in 2013). Facebook boasts 
that it is free to join and always will be, so where’s the 
money coming from to service 1 billion worldwide 
subscribers? Just like its fellow tech titan and rival 
Google, Facebook’s revenue comes almost entirely 
from advertising. Facebook does not have a diverse 
array of hot new gadgets, a countrywide network of 
brick-and-mortar retail outlets, or a full inventory of 
software for sale; instead, it has your personal infor-
mation, and the information of hundreds of millions 
of others with  Facebook accounts.
Advertisers have long understood the value of 
 Facebook’s unprecedented trove of personal informa-
tion. They can serve ads using highly specific details, 
like relationship status, location, employment status, 
favorite books, movies, or TV shows, and a host of 
other categories. For example, an Atlanta woman 
who posts that she has become engaged might be 
offered an ad for a wedding photographer on her 
Facebook page. When advertisements are served to 
finely targeted subsets of users, the response is much 
more successful than traditional types of advertising. 
A growing number of companies both big and small 
have taken notice: In 2014, Facebook generated $7.8 
billion in revenue, 88 percent of which ($7 billion) 
was from selling ads, and the remainder from selling 
games, and virtual goods. Facebook’s ad revenues 
in 2012 grew by 63 percent over the previous year, 
driven mostly by adding new users. Existing users 
are not clicking on more ads. 
That was good news for Facebook, which launched 
its IPO (initial public stock offering) in May 2012, 
and is expected to continue to increase its revenue 
in coming years. But is it good news for you, the 
Facebook user? More than ever, companies like 
Facebook and Google, which made approximately 
$55 billion in advertising revenue in 2013, are using 
your online activity to develop a frighteningly accu-
rate picture of your life. Facebook’s goal is to serve 
advertisements that are more relevant to you than 
anywhere else on the Web, but the personal informa-
tion they gather about you both with and without 
your consent can also be used against you in other 
ways.
Facebook has a diverse array of compelling and 
useful features. Facebook’s partnership with the 
Department of Labor helps to connect job seek-
ers and employers; Facebook has helped families 
find lost pets after natural disasters, such as when

tornadoes hit the Midwest in 2012; Facebook allows 
active-duty soldiers to stay in touch with their fami-
lies; it gives smaller companies a chance to further 
their e-commerce efforts and larger companies a 
chance to solidify their brands; and, perhaps most 
obviously, Facebook allows you to more easily keep 
in touch with your friends. These are the reasons 
why so many people are on Facebook.
However, Facebook’s goal is to get its users to 
share as much data as possible, because the more 
Facebook knows about you, the more accurately it 
can serve relevant advertisements to you. Facebook 
CEO Mark Zuckerberg often says that people 
want the world to be more open and connected. 
It’s unclear whether that is truly the case, but it is 
 certainly true that Facebook wants the world to be 
more open and connected, because it stands to make 
more money in that world. Critics of Facebook are 
concerned that the existence of a repository of per-
sonal data of the size that Facebook has amassed 
requires protections and privacy controls that extend 
far beyond those that Facebook currently offers.
Facebook wanting to make more money is not a 
bad thing, but the company has a checkered past 
of privacy violations and missteps that raise doubts 
about whether it should be responsible for the 
personal data of hundreds of millions of people. 
There are no laws in the United States that give 
consumers the right to know what data companies 
like Facebook have compiled. You can challenge 
information in credit reports, but you can’t even 
see what data Facebook has gathered about you, let 
alone try to change it. It’s different in Europe: you 
can request Facebook to turn over a report of all 
the information it has about you. More than ever, 
your every move, every click, on social networks is 
being used by outside entities to assess your inter-
ests, and behavior, and then pitch you an ad based 
on this knowledge. Law enforcement agencies use 
social networks to gather evidence on tax evaders, 
and other criminals; employers use social networks 
to make  decisions about prospective candidates 
for jobs; and data  aggregators are gathering as 
much information about you as they can sell to the 
 highest bidder.
In a recent study, Consumer Reports found that 
of 150 million Americans on Facebook everyday, at 
least 4.8 million are willingly sharing information 
that could be used against them in some way. That 
includes plans to travel on a particular day, which 
burglars could use to time robberies, or Liking a page 
about a particular health condition or treatment, 
which insurers could use to deny coverage. Thirteen  
million users have never adjusted Facebook’s  privacy 
controls, which allow friends using Facebook applica-
tions to unwittingly transfer your data to a third party 
without your knowledge. Credit card companies and 
other similar organizations have begun engaging in 
“weblining”, taken from the phrase redlining, by alter-
ing their treatment of you based on the actions of 
other people with profiles similar to yours.
Ninety-three percent of people polled believe 
that Internet companies should be forced to ask 
for permission before using your personal informa-
tion, and 72 percent want the ability to opt out of 
online tracking. Why, then, do so many people share 
 sensitive details of their life on Facebook? Often it’s 
because users do not realize that their data are being 
collected and transmitted in this way. A Facebook 
user’s friends are not notified if information about 
them is collected by that user’s applications. Many 
of Facebook’s features and services are enabled by 
default when they are launched without notify-
ing users. And a study by Siegel+Gale found that 
Facebook’s privacy policy is more difficult to compre-
hend than government notices or typical bank credit 
card agreements, which are notoriously dense. Next 
time you visit Facebook, click on Privacy Settings, 
and see if you can understand your options. 
Facebook’s value and growth potential is deter-
mined by how effectively it can leverage the per-
sonal data it aggregated about its users to attract 
advertisers. Facebook also stands to gain from man-
aging and avoiding the privacy concerns raised by its 
users and government regulators. For Facebook users 
that value the privacy of their personal data, this 
situation appears grim. But there are some signs that 
Facebook might become more responsible with its 
data collection processes, whether by its own volition 
or because it is forced to do so. As a publicly traded 
company, Facebook now invites more scrutiny from 
investors and regulators because, unlike in the past, 
their balance sheets, assets, and financial reporting 
documents are readily available.
In August 2012, Facebook settled a lawsuit with 
the FTC in which they were barred from misrepre-
senting the privacy or security of users’ personal 
information. Facebook was charged with deceiving 
its users by telling them they could keep their infor-
mation on Facebook private, but then repeatedly 
allowing it to be shared and made public. Facebook 
agreed to obtain user consent before making any 
change to that user’s privacy preferences, and to sub-
mit to bi-annual privacy audits by an independent 
firm for the next 20 years. Privacy advocate groups 
like the Electronic Privacy Information Center

(EPIC) want Facebook to restore its more robust pri-
vacy settings from 2009, as well as to offer complete 
access to all data it keeps about its users. Facebook 
has also come under fire from EPIC for collecting 
information about users who are not even logged 
into Facebook or may not even have accounts on 
Facebook. Facebook keeps track of activity on other 
sites that have Like buttons or “recommendations” 
widgets, and records the time of your visit and your 
IP address when you visit a site with those features, 
regardless of whether or not you click on them.
While U.S. Facebook users have little recourse to 
access data that Facebook has collected on them, 
users from other countries have made inroads in 
this regard. An Austrian law student was able to 
get a full copy of his personal information from 
Facebook’s Dublin office, due to the more stringent 
consumer privacy protections in Ireland. The full 
document was 1,222 pages long and covered three 
years of activity on the site, including deleted Wall 
posts and messages with sensitive personal informa-
tion and deleted e-mail addresses. In Europe, 40,000 
Facebook users have already requested their data, 
and European law requires that Facebook respond to 
these requests within 40 days.
It isn’t just text-based data that Facebook is stock-
piling, either. Facebook is also compiling a biometric 
database of unprecedented size. The company stores 
more than 60 billion photos on its servers and that 
number grows by 250 million each day. A recent fea-
ture launched by Facebook called Tag Suggest scans 
photographs using facial recognition technology. 
When Tag Suggest was launched, it was enabled for 
many users without opting in. This database has value 
to law enforcement and other organizations looking to 
compile profiles of users for use in advertising. EPIC 
also has demanded that Facebook stop creating facial 
recognition profiles without user consent.
In 2012, as part of the settlement of another 
class-action lawsuit, Facebook agreed to allow users 
to opt in to its Sponsored Stories service, which 
serves advertisements in the user’s News Feed 
that highlight products and businesses that your 
Facebook friends are using. This allowed users to 
control which of their actions on Facebook gen-
erate advertisements that their friends will see. 
Sponsored Stories are one of the most effective 
forms of advertising on Facebook because they 
don’t seem like advertisements at all to most users. 
Facebook had previously argued that users were 
giving “implied consent” every time they clicked a 
Like button on a page. Despite this earlier settle-
ment, in January 2014, Facebook closed down its 
Sponsored Stories feature entirely, after many law-
suits, attempted settlements, and criticism from pri-
vacy groups, the FTC, and annoyed parents whose 
children’s photos were being used throughout 
Facebook to sell products. In August 2013, Facebook 
had agreed to a settlement in a class action lawsuit 
brought by parents of teenagers caught up in the 
Facebook information machine. Every time their 
children liked a product on Facebook, their photos 
were used to promote the product not just to their 
friends, but to everyone on Facebook who poten-
tially might be interested. The legal settlement only 
enraged privacy advocates and Congress, leading to 
Facebook’s abandonment of Sponsored Stories. 
While Facebook has shut down one of its more 
 egregious privacy-invading features, the company’s 
Data Use policies make it very clear that, as a condi-
tion of using the service, users grant the company 
wide latitude in using their information in adver-
tising. This includes a person’s name, photo, com-
ments, and other information. Facebook’s existing 
policies make clear that users are required to grant 
the company wide permission to use their personal 
information in advertising as a condition of using 
the service. This includes “social advertising” where 
your personal information is broadcast to your 
friends, and indeed, the entire Facebook service if 
the company sees fit. While users can limit some 
uses, an advanced degree in Facebook data features 
is required. 
Despite consumer protests and government scru-
tiny, Facebook continues to challenge its customers’ 
sense of control over their personal information. In 
January 2013, Facebook launched its Graph Search 
program, a social network search engine intended to 
rival Google but based on a totally different approach. 
Rather than scour the Internet for information related 
to a user’s search term, Graph Search responds to user 
queries with information produced by all Facebook 
users on their personal pages, and their friends per-
sonal pages. For instance, Graph Search, without 
consent of the user, allows any Facebook user to type 
in your name, and click the link “Photos of…” which 
appears underneath the search bar. Complete strang-
ers can find pictures of you. The person searched 
may not be able to control who sees personal photos: 
it depends on the privacy settings of other users with 
whom the photos were shared. If you shared your 
photos with friends who had less strict privacy set-
tings, then those lesser settings determine who will 
have access to your photos. Graph Search results 
in new pages being created that contain the search 
results. These pages present Facebook with additional 
194 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise

opportunities to sell ads, and to monetize the activities 
and information of its users. 
The future of Facebook as a private corpora-
tion, and its stock price, will depend on its ability to 
monetize its most valuable asset: personal, private 
information.

oyota Motor Europe (TME) manages the sales, marketing, engineer-
ing, and dealership network for Toyota and Lexus vehicles in Europe.  
TME is based in Brussels, Belgium.  Founded in 1963,  TME sales 
peaked at 1.3 units in 2007, and ran about 900,000 units in 2014.  
TME employs about 95,000 people.  T31 National Marketing and Sales 
Companies (NMSCs) coordinate 3,100 sales outlets or dealerships, and nine 
manufacturing plants.
With millions of consumers in Europe who have purchased Toyota cars in 
the last 50 years, providing a consistent repair and maintenance service to 
customers was always a challenge.  Repair and maintenance manuals had 
been replaced by personal computers in the 1990s and 2000s.   These early 
computerization efforts simply automated the traditional printed manuals, 
but had the advantage that they could be updated by distributing disks to the 
sales outlets.  One problem: some outlets did not update their PCs in a timely 
fashion, and there was no way for TME management to manage the upgrade 
process. 
TME changed its approach to maintenance as onboard computers and sen-
sors were introduced into Toyota vehicles.  These onboard computers could 
gather and store information from vehicle sensors.  The vehicle data could be 
analyzed by PCs at dealerships.  TME provided dealerships with over 3,500 
new PCs running up-to-date software that could immediately analyze a cus-
tomer’s car engine performance, and provide critical maintenance and repair 
information and recommendations to local mechanics.

While this change in approach was a vast improvement, management did not 
have a solution for how to manage these 3,500 computers, or to know if local 
outlets were using the latest versions of the software.  In fact these PCs remained 
outside the TME firewall, and they were essentially stand-alone computers as 
in the past. Thus, it was impossible for headquarters to know if dealers were 
providing the same quality of service to customers, or to know if dealers’ PCs 
were free of viruses and operating appropriately.  One partial solution was to 
send TME IT staff to the dealerships to install software updates, check for 
viruses, and advise mechanics on new techniques.  But this was wasteful and 
time-consuming.
Management decided to use a cloud-based solution from Microsoft called 
Windows Intune.  Intune allows central IT staff to run PC management tasks 
remotely.  New software can be installed, virus protection programs run, and 
the status updated.  Each local PC needs and Internet connection, and standard 
browser.  The local PC downloads a client version of the program.  The client 
sends information on the PC to central IT staff.
Compared to building their own system to manage its PCs, TME found the 
implementation process was more efficient.  TME sent each dealership an 
installation package, and a link to the corporate TMW Web site.  Dealerships 
would establish a link to the Web site, and download the dealership software.  
The Windows Intune interface is easy to use and requires only a few hours of 
training.
Rather than spend on building their own IT infrastructure and software to 
management its dealers’ PCs, the Intune cloud-based model provides a far less 
expensive pay-as-you go, (demand computing) model, and there are no addi-
tional hardware or software costs, or maintenance costs.  TME believes it saved 
over  €1 million in infrastructure and management costs over a three-year 
period.  The transition to tablet PCs in 2015 is expected to be problem-free 
because of their investment in a coordinated, cloud-based solution. Other man-
agement objectives were also achieved such as better security, customer ser-
vice, and reduced operating costs.

T
he experience of Toyota Motor Europe illustrates the importance of 
information technology infrastructure in running a business today. The 
right technology at the right price can improve organizational performance.  
Toyota Europe was able to use contemporary cloud technology infrastructure to 
improve the quality of its service, enhance security, and reduce operating.   But 
it wasn’t just technology that needed updating.  Toyota also changed its entire 
philosophy of how to maintain vehicles using embedded computers in vehicles.  
In addition, it needed to change how it supported its 3,100 dealers.  Rather than 
sending expensive staff members to each dealer, they were able to rely instead 
on the cloud-based solution to provide support.
The chapter-opening case diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter.  In an effort to upgrade the dealer computer system, 
Toyota Motor Europe found that new computer infrastructure was needed in order 
to properly manage their 3,000 strong dealer network.  Increasingly, dealer PCs 
were under attack from computer viruses, and dealers could often not upgrade

WHAT IS IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT ARE 
THE STAGES AND DRIVERS OF IT 
INFRASTRUCTURE EVOLUTION?
I
n Chapter 1, we defined information technology (IT) infrastructure as the 
shared technology resources that provide the platform for the firm’s 
 specific information system applications. An IT infrastructure includes 
 investment in hardware, software, and services—such as consulting, 
 education, and training—that are shared across the entire firm or across entire 
business units in the firm. A firm’s IT infrastructure provides the foundation for 
their software in a coordinated fashion.  Customers in turn were expecting dealers 
to provide the most current solutions for their cars in need of repair.  The existing 
IT infrastructure would require significant additional investment to solve these 
challenges.
The solution to these challenges involved changes in management, organization, 
and technology.   Management chose to use a new approach to coordinating dealer 
PCs by adopting a cloud-based solution from Microsoft called Intune.  Management 
developed an implementation plan, and made organizational changes in training, 
and in the culture of the organization.  Rather than rely on visits from headquarters 
IT staff, dealers were now expected to maintain their local PCs using the company’s 
new management software. The solution is serving important management goals: 
lower cost, better security, and better management of the dealer PC network.
Here are some questions to think about: How does information technology help 
Toyota Motor Europe solve its own business problems? How does the new cloud-
based technology help the dealers solve their business problems?

serving  customers, working with vendors, and managing internal firm  business 
processes (see Figure 5.1).
Supplying firms worldwide with IT infrastructure (hardware and software) 
in 2014 is estimated to be a $3.8 trillion industry when telecommunications, 
 networking equipment, and telecommunications services (Internet, telephone, 
and data transmission) are included. This does not include IT and related  business 
process consulting services, which add another $400 billion. Investments in 
infrastructure account for between 25 and 50 percent of information technology 
expenditures in large firms, led by financial services firms where IT investment 
is well over half of all capital investment.
DEFINING IT INFRASTRUCTURE
An IT infrastructure consists of a set of physical devices and software applica-
tions that are required to operate the entire enterprise. But an IT infrastructure 
is also a set of firmwide services budgeted by management and comprising 
both human and technical capabilities. These services include the following:
• Computing platforms used to provide computing services that connect 
employees, customers, and suppliers into a coherent digital environment, 
including large mainframes, midrange computers, desktop and laptop 
 computers, and mobile handheld and remote cloud computing services.
• Telecommunications services that provide data, voice, and video connectivity 
to employees, customers, and suppliers
• Data management services that store and manage corporate data and provide 
capabilities for analyzing the data
 FIGURE 5.1 
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FIRM, IT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
BUSINESS CAPABILITIES
The services a firm is capable of providing to its customers, suppliers, and employees are a direct 
function of its IT infrastructure. Ideally, this infrastructure should support the firm’s business and 
information systems strategy. New information technologies have a powerful impact on business and 
IT strategies, as well as the services that can be provided to customers.
202 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

• Application software services, including online software services, that 
 provide enterprise-wide capabilities such as enterprise resource  planning, 
customer relationship management, supply chain management, and 
 knowledge management systems that are shared by all business units
• Physical facilities management services that develop and manage the 
 physical installations required for computing, telecommunications, and data 
management services
• IT management services that plan and develop the infrastructure,  coordinate 
with the business units for IT services, manage accounting for the IT 
 expenditure, and provide project management services
• IT standards services that provide the firm and its business units with 
 policies that determine which information technology will be used, when, 
and how
• IT education services that provide training in system use to employees and 
offer managers training in how to plan for and manage IT investments
• IT research and development services that provide the firm with research 
on potential future IT projects and investments that could help the firm 
 differentiate itself in the marketplace
This “service platform” perspective makes it easier to understand the 
 business value provided by infrastructure investments. For instance, the real 
business value of a fully loaded personal computer operating at 3.4  gigahertz 
that costs about $1,000 and a high-speed Internet connection is hard to 
 understand without knowing who will use it and how it will be used. When 
we look at the services provided by these tools, however, their value becomes 
more apparent: The new PC makes it possible for a high-cost employee making 
$100,000 a year to connect to all the company’s major systems and the public 
Internet. The high-speed Internet service saves this employee about one hour 
per day in reduced wait time for Internet information. Without this PC and 
Internet connection, the value of this one employee to the firm might be cut 
in half.
EVOLUTION OF IT INFRASTRUCTURE
The IT infrastructure in organizations today is an outgrowth of over 50 years 
of evolution in computing platforms. There have been five stages in this 
 evolution, each representing a different configuration of computing power 
and infrastructure elements (see Figure 5.2). The five eras are general-pur-
pose mainframe and minicomputer computing, personal computers, client/
server networks, enterprise computing, and cloud and mobile computing.
Technologies that characterize one era may also be used in another time 
period for other purposes. For example, some companies still run traditional 
mainframe systems or use mainframe computers as massive servers supporting 
large Web sites and corporate enterprise applications.
General-Purpose Mainframe and Minicomputer Era: 
(1959 to Present)
The introduction of the IBM 1401 and 7090 transistorized machines in 1959 
marked the beginning of widespread commercial use of mainframe computers. 
In 1965, the mainframe computer truly came into its own with the introduction 
of the IBM 360 series. The 360 was the first commercial computer with a power-
ful operating system that could provide time sharing, multitasking, and virtual 
memory in more advanced models. IBM has dominated mainframe computing

 FIGURE 5.2 
ERAS IN IT INFRASTRUCTURE EVOLUTION
Illustrated here are the typical computing configurations characterizing each of the five eras of IT 
infrastructure evolution.

from this point on. Mainframe computers became powerful enough to support 
thousands of online remote terminals connected to the centralized mainframe 
using proprietary communication protocols and proprietary data lines.
The mainframe era was a period of highly centralized computing under 
the control of professional programmers and systems operators (usually in 
a  corporate data center), with most elements of infrastructure provided by a 
single vendor, the manufacturer of the hardware and the software.
This pattern began to change with the introduction of minicomputers 
 produced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1965. DEC minicom-
puters (PDP-11 and later the VAX machines) offered powerful machines at far 
lower prices than IBM mainframes, making possible decentralized computing, 
customized to the specific needs of individual departments or business units 
rather than time sharing on a single huge mainframe. In recent years, the 
 minicomputer has evolved into a midrange computer or midrange server and 
is part of a network.
Personal Computer Era: (1981 to Present)
Although the first truly personal computers (PCs) appeared in the 1970s (the 
Xerox Alto, the MITS Altair 8800, and the Apple I and II, to name a few), these 
machines had only limited distribution to computer enthusiasts. The appear-
ance of the IBM PC in 1981 is usually considered the beginning of the PC era 
because this machine was the first to be widely adopted by American  businesses. 
At first using the DOS operating system, a text-based command  language, 
and later the Microsoft Windows operating system, the Wintel PC computer 
(Windows  operating system software on a computer with an Intel micropro-
cessor) became the standard desktop personal computer. In 2014, there are an 
 estimated 2 billion PCs in the world, and about 276 million new PCs were sold 
in 2014 (Gartner, 2014). Approximately 90 percent are thought to run a version 
of Windows, and 10 percent run a Macintosh OS. The Wintel  dominance as a 
computing platform is receding as iPhone and Android device sales increase. 
About 1.75 billion people worldwide own smartphones, and most of these users 
access the Internet with their mobile devices.
Proliferation of PCs in the 1980s and early 1990s launched a spate of  personal 
desktop productivity software tools—word processors, spreadsheets, electronic 
presentation software, and small data management programs—that were very 
valuable to both home and corporate users. These PCs were stand-alone  systems 
until PC operating system software in the 1990s made it possible to link them 
into networks.
Client/Server Era (1983 to Present)
In client/server computing, desktop or laptop computers called clients are 
networked to powerful server computers that provide the client computers with 
a variety of services and capabilities. Computer processing work is split between 
these two types of machines. The client is the user point of entry, whereas 
the server typically processes and stores shared data, serves up Web pages, or 
 manages network activities. The term “server” refers to both the software applica-
tion and the physical computer on which the network software runs. The server 
could be a mainframe, but today, server computers typically are more power-
ful versions of personal computers, based on inexpensive chips and often using 
 multiple processors in a single computer box., or in server racks.
The simplest client/server network consists of a client computer  networked 
to a server computer, with processing split between the two types of machines. 
This is called a two-tiered client/server architecture. Whereas simple client/server 
 
Chapter 5 IT Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies 
205

networks can be found in small businesses, most corporations have more 
 complex, multitiered (often called N-tier) client/server  architectures in 
which the work of the entire network is balanced over several  different levels 
of servers, depending on the kind of service being requested (see Figure 5.3).
For instance, at the first level, a Web server will serve a Web page to a 
client in response to a request for service. Web server software is responsible 
for locating and managing stored Web pages. If the client requests access to a 
 corporate system (a product list or price information, for instance), the request 
is passed along to an application server. Application server software  handles 
all application operations between a user and an organization’s back-end 
 business systems. The application server may reside on the same computer 
as the Web server or on its own dedicated computer. Chapters 6 and 7 provide 
more detail on other pieces of software that are used in multitiered client/
server architectures for e-commerce and e-business.
Client/server computing enables businesses to distribute computing work 
across a series of smaller, inexpensive machines that cost much less than 
 centralized mainframe systems. The result is an explosion in computing power 
and applications throughout the firm.
Novell NetWare was the leading technology for client/server networking at 
the beginning of the client/server era. Today, Microsoft is the market leader 
with its Windows operating systems (Windows Server, Windows 8, Windows 7, 
and Windows Vista).
Enterprise Computing Era (1992 to Present)
In the early 1990s, firms turned to networking standards and software tools that 
could integrate disparate networks and applications throughout the firm into an 
enterprise-wide infrastructure. As the Internet developed into a trusted com-
munications environment after 1995, business firms began seriously using the 
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networking standard to 
tie their disparate networks together. We discuss TCP/IP in detail in Chapter 7.
The resulting IT infrastructure links different pieces of computer  hardware 
and smaller networks into an enterprise-wide network so that informa-
tion can flow freely across the organization and between the firm and other 
 FIGURE 5.3 
A MULTITIERED CLIENT/SERVER NETWORK (N-TIER)
In a multitiered client/server network, client requests for service are handled by different levels of 
servers.

 organizations. It can link different types of computer hardware, including 
 mainframes,  servers, PCs, and mobile devices, and it includes public infrastruc-
tures such as the telephone system, the Internet, and public network services. 
The enterprise infrastructure also requires software to link disparate applica-
tions and enable data to flow freely among different parts of the business, such 
as enterprise applications (see Chapters 2 and 9) and Web services (discussed 
in Section 5.4).
Cloud and Mobile Computing Era (2000 to Present)
The growing bandwidth power of the Internet has pushed the client/server 
model one step further, towards what is called the “Cloud Computing Model.” 
Cloud computing refers to a model of computing that provides access to a 
shared pool of computing resources (computers, storage, applications, and 
 services) over a network, often the Internet. These “clouds” of computing 
resources can be accessed on an as-needed basis from any connected device 
and location. Currently, cloud computing is the fastest growing form of 
 computing, with companies spending about $175 billion on cloud infrastruc-
ture and  services in 2014 (Hamilton, 2014).
Thousands or even hundreds of thousands computers are located in cloud data 
centers, where they can be accessed by desktop computers, laptop computers, 
tablets, entertainment centers, smartphones, and other client machines linked to 
the Internet, with both personal and corporate computing increasingly moving 
to mobile platforms. Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft operate huge, scalable 
cloud computing centers that provide computing power, data storage, and high-
speed Internet connections to firms that want to maintain their IT infrastructures 
remotely.Firms such as Google, Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce.com sell 
software applications as services delivered over the Internet.
We discuss cloud and mobile computing in more detail in Section 5.3. The 
Learning Tracks include a table titled Comparing Stages in IT Infrastructure 
Evolution, which compares each era on the infrastructure dimensions introduced.
TECHNOLOGY DRIVERS OF INFRASTRUCTURE 
EVOLUTION
The changes in IT infrastructure we have just described have resulted from 
developments in computer processing, memory chips, storage devices, 
 telecommunications and networking hardware and software, and software 
design that have exponentially increased computing power while exponentially 
reducing costs. Let’s look at the most important developments.
Moore’s Law and Microprocessing Power
In 1965, Gordon Moore, the director of Fairchild Semiconductor’s Research and 
Development Laboratories, an early manufacturer of integrated circuits, wrote 
in Electronics magazine that since the first microprocessor chip was  introduced 
in 1959, the number of components on a chip with the smallest manufacturing 
costs per component (generally transistors) had doubled each year. This asser-
tion became the foundation of Moore’s Law. Moore later reduced the rate of 
growth to a doubling every two years.
This law would later be interpreted in multiple ways. There are at least three 
variations of Moore’s Law, none of which Moore ever stated: (1) the power of 
microprocessors doubles every 18 months; (2) computing power doubles every 
18 months; and (3) the price of computing falls by half every 18 months.
 
Chapter 5 IT Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies 
207

Figure 5.4 illustrates the relationship between number of transistors on a 
microprocessor and millions of instructions per second (MIPS), a common 
measure of processor power. Figure 5.5 shows the exponential decline in the 
cost of transistors and rise in computing power. For instance, in 2014, you can 
buy an Intel i7 quad-core processor chip with 2.5 billion transistors for about 
one ten-millionth of a dollar per transistor.
Exponential growth in the number of transistors and the power of processors 
coupled with an exponential decline in computing costs is likely to continue. 
Chip manufacturers continue to miniaturize components. Today’s transistors 
should no longer be compared to the size of a human hair but rather to the size 
of a virus.
By using nanotechnology, chip manufacturers can even shrink the size 
of transistors down to the width of several atoms. Nanotechnology uses 
 individual atoms and molecules to create computer chips and other devices 
that are  thousands of times smaller than current technologies permit. Chip 
 manufacturers are trying to develop a manufacturing process to produce 
 nanotube processors economically (Figure 5.6). Stanford University scientists 
have built a nanotube computer. 
The Law of Mass Digital Storage
A second technology driver of IT infrastructure change is the Law of Mass 
Digital Storage. The amount of digital information is roughly doubling every 
year (Gantz and Reinsel, 2011; Lyman and Varian, 2003). Fortunately, the cost of 
storing digital information is falling at an exponential rate of 100 percent a year. 
Figure 5.7 shows that the number of megabytes that can be stored on  magnetic 
media for $1 from 1950 to the present roughly doubled every 15 months. In 
2014, a 500 gigabyte hard disk drive sells at retail for about $60. 
 FIGURE 5.4

power. Processing power has increased to over 200,000 MIPS (2.6 billion instructions per second).

Metcalfe’s Law and Network Economics
Moore’s Law and the Law of Mass Storage help us understand why computing 
resources are now so readily available. But why do people want more  computing 
and storage power? The economics of networks and the growth of the Internet 
provide some answers.
Robert Metcalfe—inventor of Ethernet local area network technology—
claimed in 1970 that the value or power of a network grows exponentially 
as a function of the number of network members. Metcalfe and others point 
to the increasing returns to scale that network members receive as more and 
more people join the network. As the number of members in a network grows 
 linearly, the value of the entire system grows exponentially and continues to 
grow forever as members increase. Demand for information technology has 
been driven by the social and business value of digital networks, which rapidly 
multiply the number of actual and potential links among network members.
Declining Communications Costs and the Internet
A fourth technology driver transforming IT infrastructure is the rapid decline 
in the costs of communication and the exponential growth in the size of the 
Internet. There are over 3 billion Internet users worldwide (Internetlivestats.
com, 2014). Figure 5.8 illustrates the exponentially declining cost of communi-
cation both over the Internet and over telephone networks (which increasingly 
are based on the Internet). As communication costs fall toward a very small 
number and approach 0, utilization of communication and computing facilities 
explode.
 FIGURE 5.7 
THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE PER DOLLAR RISES 
EXPONENTIALLY, 1950–2014
Since the first magnetic storage device was used in 1955, the amount of storage a dollar buys has 
risen exponentially, doubling the amount of digital storage for each dollar expended every 15 months 
on average. Cloud storage services provide 100 gigabytes of storage for about $1.00

EXPONENTIAL DECLINES IN INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS 
COSTS
One reason for the growth in the Internet population is the rapid decline in Internet connection and 
overall communication costs. The cost per kilobit of Internet access has fallen exponentially since 
1995. Digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable modems now deliver a kilobit of communication for a 
retail price of less than one penny.

To take advantage of the business value associated with the Internet, firms 
must greatly expand their Internet connections, including wireless connec-
tivity, and greatly expand the power of their client/server networks, desktop 
 clients, and mobile computing devices. There is every reason to believe these 
trends will continue.
Standards and Network Effects
Today’s enterprise infrastructure and Internet computing would be impossi-
ble—both now and in the future—without agreements among manufacturers 
and widespread consumer acceptance of technology standards. Technology 
standards are specifications that establish the compatibility of products and the 
ability to communicate in a network (Stango, 2004).
Technology standards unleash powerful economies of scale and result in 
price declines as manufacturers focus on the products built to a single standard. 
Without these economies of scale, computing of any sort would be far more 
expensive than is currently the case. Table 5.1 describes important standards 
that have shaped IT infrastructure.
Beginning in the 1990s, corporations started moving toward standard 
 computing and communications platforms. The Wintel PC with the Windows 
 operating system and Microsoft Office desktop productivity applications 
became the  standard desktop and mobile client computing platform. (It now 
shares the  spotlight with other standards, such as Apple's iOS and Macintosh 
operating systems and the Android operating system.) Widespread adoption of 
Unix-Linux as the enterprise server operating system of choice made possible 
the replacement of proprietary and expensive mainframe infrastructures. In 
telecommunications, the Ethernet standard enabled PCs to connect together 
in small local area networks (LANs; see Chapter 7), and the TCP/IP standard 
enabled these LANs to be connected into firmwide networks, and ultimately, to 
the Internet.

5.2 
WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS OF IT 
INFRASTRUCTURE?
IT infrastructure today is composed of seven major components. Figure 5.9 
illustrates these infrastructure components and the major vendors within each 
component category. These components constitute investments that must be 
coordinated with one another to provide the firm with a coherent infrastructure.
In the past, technology vendors supplying these components were often 
in competition with one another, offering purchasing firms a mixture of 
 incompatible, proprietary, partial solutions. But increasingly the vendor firms 
have been forced by large customers to cooperate in strategic partnerships 
with one another. For instance, a hardware and services provider such as 
IBM cooperates with all the major enterprise software providers, has strategic 
 relationships with system integrators, and promises to work with whichever 
database products its client firms wish to use (even though it sells its own 
d atabase management software called DB2).
COMPUTER HARDWARE PLATFORMS
Firms worldwide are expected to spend $669 billion on computer hardware 
devices in 2014, including mainframes, servers, PCs, tablets, and smartphones. 
TABLE 5.1 SOME IMPORTANT STANDARDS IN COMPUTING
STANDARD
SIGNIFICANCE 
American Standard Code for 
Information Interchange (ASCII) (1958)
Made it possible for computer machines from different manufacturers to exchange data; later used as 
the universal language linking input and output devices such as keyboards and mice to computers. 
Adopted by the American National Standards Institute in 1963.
Common Business Oriented Language 
(COBOL) (1959)
An easy-to-use software language that greatly expanded the ability of programmers to write 
business-related programs and reduced the cost of software. Sponsored by the Defense Department in 
1959.
Unix (1969–1975)
A powerful multitasking, multiuser, portable operating system initially developed at Bell Labs (1969) 
and later released for use by others (1975). It operates on a wide variety of computers from different 
manufacturers. Adopted by Sun, IBM, HP, and others in the 1980s, it became the most widely used 
enterprise-level operating system.
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet 
Protocol (TCP/IP) (1974)
Suite of communications protocols and a common addressing scheme that enables millions of 
computers to connect together in one giant global network (the Internet). Later, it was used as the 
default networking protocol suite for local area networks and intranets. Developed in the early 1970s 
for the U.S. Department of Defense.
Ethernet (1973)
A network standard for connecting desktop computers into local area networks that enabled the 
widespread adoption of client/server computing and local area networks, and further stimulated the 
adoption of personal computers.
IBM/Microsoft/Intel Personal Computer 
(1981)
The standard Wintel design for personal desktop computing based on standard Intel processors and 
other standard devices, Microsoft DOS, and later Windows software. The emergence of this standard, 
low-cost product laid the foundation for a 25-year period of explosive growth in computing 
throughout all organizations around the globe. Today, more than 1 billion PCs power business and 
government activities every day.
World Wide Web (1989–1993)
Standards for storing, retrieving, formatting, and displaying information as a worldwide web of 
electronic pages incorporating text, graphics, audio, and video enables creation of a global repository 
of billions of Web pages. 
212 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

You can think of all these computers and their processors as the computer 
 hardware platform for corporate (and personal) computing worldwide.
There are approximately 2 billion PCs in the world today, 2,000 government 
data centers, and an estimated 8,000 corporate data centers and cloud comput-
ing centers. Nearly all their computing takes place using microprocessor “chips” 
manufactured or designed by Intel Corporation, and to a lesser extent, AMD 
Corporation. Intel and AMD processors are often referred to as “i86” processors 
because the original IBM PCs used an Intel 8086 processor, and all the Intel (and 
AMD) chips that followed are downward compatible with this processor. (For 
instance, you should be able to run a software application designed ten years ago 
on a new PC computer you bought yesterday.) Without this commonality in i86 
processors, it is unlikely that today’s installed base of 2 billion PCs would exist.
The computer platform has changed dramatically in the last decade, with the 
introduction of mobile computing devices, from the iPod in 2001, to the iPhone 
in 2007, and the iPad in 2010. Worldwide, 1.7 billion people use smartphones. 
You can think of these devices as a second computer hardware platform, one 
that is consumer device-driven. 
 FIGURE 5.9 
THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE ECOSYSTEM
There are seven major components that must be coordinated to provide the firm with a coherent IT infrastructure. Listed here are 
major technologies and suppliers for each component.
 
Chapter 5 IT Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies 
213

The computers with Intel microprocessors in the first computer hard-
ware platform use complex instruction set computing (CISC), with several 
thousand native instructions built into the chip. This requires a considerable 
number of transistors per processor, consumes power, and generates heat. 
Mobile devices in the second computer hardware platform are not required to 
perform as many tasks as computers in the first computer hardware  platform. 
They are able to use reduced instruction set computing (RISC), which  contains 
a smaller set of instructions, consumes less power, and generates less heat. 
Apple and Samsung consumer devices use microprocessors designed by ARM 
Holdings, Inc., a British firm. RISC processors for mobile devices are manufac-
tured by a wide range of firms, including Apple, Texas Instruments, Samsung, 
and Qualcomm. 
The server market, which includes infrastructures ranging from a few 
 computers to large data centers with over 10,000 individual computers, uses 
mostly Intel and AMD processors in the form of blade servers on racks. Blade 
servers are computers consisting of a circuit board with processors, memory 
and network connections that are stored in racks. They take up less space than 
traditional box-based PC servers. Secondary storage is provided by a hard drive 
in each blade server, but more commonly by external mass-storage devices. 
Some specialized servers use Sun SPARC or IBM microprocessors specifically 
designed for server use. 
Mainframes have not disappeared. Mainframes continue to be used to 
 reliably and securely handle huge volumes of transactions, for analyz-
ing very large quantities of data, and for handling large workloads in cloud 
 computing centers. The mainframe is still the digital workhorse for banking 
and  telecommunications networks that are often running software  programs 
that are older and require a specific hardware platform. However, the number 
of providers has dwindled to one:IBM. IBM has also repurposed its mainframe 
systems so they can be used as giant servers for massive enterprise  networks 
and corporate Web sites. A single IBM mainframe can run up to 17,000 
instances of Linux or Windows Server software and is capable of replacing 
thousands of smaller blade servers (see the discussion of virtualization in 
Section 5.3).
OPERATING SYSTEM PLATFORMS
Microsoft Windows Server comprises about 35 percent of the server  operating 
system market, with 65 percent of corporate servers using some form of the 
Unix operating system or Linux, an inexpensive and robust open source 
 relative of Unix. Microsoft Windows Server is capable of providing enterprise-
wide operating system and network services, and appeals to organizations 
 seeking Windows-based IT infrastructures.
Unix and Linux are scalable, reliable, and much less expensive than 
 mainframe operating systems. They can also run on many different types of 
processors. The major providers of Unix operating systems are IBM, HP, and 
Sun, each with slightly different and partially incompatible versions.
At the client level, 90 percent of PCs use some form of the Microsoft Windows 
 operating system (such as Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista) to 
manage the resources and activities of the computer. However, there is now a 
much greater variety of operating systems than in the past, with new operating 
systems for computing on handheld mobile digital devices or cloud-connected 
computers.
214 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

Google’s Chrome OS provides a lightweight operating system for cloud 
 computing using a Web-connected computer. Programs are not stored on 
the user’s computer but are used over the Internet and accessed through 
the Chrome Web browser. User data reside on servers across the Internet. 
Android is an open source operating system for mobile devices such as 
smartphones and tablet computers developed by the Open Handset Alliance 
led by Google. It has become the most popular smartphone platform world-
wide, competing with iOS, Apple's mobile operating system for the iPhone, 
iPad, and iPod Touch.
Conventional client operating system software is designed around the mouse 
and keyboard, but increasingly becoming more natural and intuitive by using 
touch technology. iOS, the operating system for the phenomenally popular 
Apple iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch, features a multitouch interface, where 
users employ one or more fingers to manipulate objects on a screen without a 
mouse or keyboard. Microsoft's Windows 8, which runs on tablets as well as 
PCs, has a user interface optimized for touch, but also works with a mouse and 
keyboard. Multitouch capabilities are also available on some Android devices.
ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS
Firms worldwide are expected to spend about $320 billion in 2014 on software 
for enterprise applications that are treated as components of IT infrastructure. 
We introduced the various types of enterprise applications in Chapter 2, and 
Chapter 9 provides a more detailed discussion of each.
The largest providers of enterprise application software are SAP and Oracle 
(which acquired PeopleSoft). Also included in this category is middleware 
software supplied by vendors such as IBM and Oracle for achieving firmwide 
integration by linking the firm’s existing application systems. Microsoft is 
attempting to move into the lower ends of this market by focusing on small 
and medium-sized businesses that have not yet implemented enterprise 
applications.
DATA MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE
Enterprise database management software is responsible for organizing and 
managing the firm’s data so that they can be efficiently accessed and used. 
Chapter 6 describes this software in detail. The leading database software 
 providers are IBM (DB2), Oracle, Microsoft (SQL Server), and Sybase (Adaptive 
Server Enterprise), which supply more than 90 percent of the U.S. database 
 software marketplace. MySQL is a Linux open source relational database 
 product now owned by Oracle Corporation, and Apache Hadoop is an open 
source software framework for managing massive data sets (see Chapter 6).
The physical data storage market is dominated by EMC Corporation for 
large-scale systems, and a small number of PC hard disk manufacturers led by 
Seagate and Western Digital.
Digital information is doubling every two years and the market for digital data 
storage devices has been growing at more than 15 percent annually over the last 
five years. In addition to traditional disk arrays and tape libraries, large firms are 
turning to network-based storage technologies. Storage area networks (SANs) 
connect multiple storage devices on a separate high-speed network dedicated 
to storage. The SAN creates a large central pool of storage that can be rapidly 
accessed and shared by multiple servers.

NETWORKING/TELECOMMUNICATIONS PLATFORMS
Companies worldwide are expected to spend $1.65 trillion for telecommu-
nications services in 2014 (Gartner, 2014). Chapter 7 is devoted to an in-
depth description of the enterprise networking environment, including the 
Internet. Windows Server is predominantly used as a local area network oper-
ating system, followed by Linux and Unix. Large, enterprise wide area net-
works use some variant of Unix. Most local area networks, as well as wide 
area enterprise networks, use the TCP/IP protocol suite as a standard (see 
Chapter 7).
The leading networking hardware providers are Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, and 
Juniper Networks. Telecommunications platforms are typically provided by 
telecommunications/telephone services companies that offer voice and data 
connectivity, wide area networking, wireless services, and Internet access. 
Leading telecommunications service vendors include AT&T and Verizon. 
This market is exploding with new providers of cellular wireless, high-speed 
Internet, and Internet telephone services.
INTERNET PLATFORMS
Internet platforms overlap with, and must relate to, the firm’s general 
 networking infrastructure and hardware and software platforms. They include 
 hardware, software, and management services to support a firm’s Web site, 
including Web hosting services, routers, and cabling or wireless equipment. 
A Web hosting service maintains a large Web server, or series of servers, and 
provides  fee-paying subscribers with space to maintain their Web sites.
The Internet revolution created a veritable explosion in server computers, 
with many firms collecting thousands of small servers to run their Internet 
operations. Since then there has been a steady push toward server consolidation, 
reducing the number of server computers by increasing the size and power of 
each and by using software tools that make it possible to run more  applications 
on a single server. The Internet hardware server market has become increas-
ingly concentrated in the hands of IBM, Dell, Sun (Oracle), and HP, as prices 
have fallen dramatically.
The major Web software application development tools and suites are 
 supplied by Microsoft (Microsoft Visual Studio and the Microsoft .NET family 
of development tools), Oracle-Sun (Sun’s Java is the most widely used tool for 
developing interactive Web applications on both the server and client sides), 
and a host of independent software developers, including Adobe (Creative 
Suite) and Real Networks (media software). Chapter 7 describes the compo-
nents of the firm’s Internet platform in greater detail.
CONSULTING AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION SERVICES
Today, even a large firm does not have the staff, the skills, the budget, or 
the necessary experience to deploy and maintain its entire IT infrastructure. 
Implementing a new infrastructure requires (as noted in Chapters 3 and 14) sig-
nificant changes in business processes and procedures, training and  education, 
and software integration. Leading consulting firms providing this expertise 
include Accenture, IBM Global Services, HP, Infosys, and Wipro Technologies.
Software integration means ensuring the new infrastructure works 
with the firm’s older, so-called legacy systems and ensuring the new 
 elements of the infrastructure work with one another. Legacy systems are 
216 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

generally older transaction processing systems created for mainframe computers
that continue to be used to avoid the high cost of replacing or redesigning them. 
Replacing these systems is cost prohibitive and generally not necessary if these 
older systems can be integrated into a contemporary infrastructure.
5.3 
WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS IN COMPUTER 
HARDWARE PLATFORMS?
The exploding power of computer hardware and networking technology has 
dramatically changed how businesses organize their computing power,  putting 
more of this power on networks and mobile handheld devices. We look at seven 
hardware trends: the mobile digital platform, consumerization of IT,  quantum 
computing, virtualization, cloud computing, green computing (as described in 
the Interactive Session on Technology), and  high- performance/power-saving 
processors.
THE MOBILE DIGITAL PLATFORM
Chapter 1 pointed out that new mobile digital computing platforms have 
emerged as alternatives to PCs and larger computers. Smartphones such as the 
iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry smartphones have taken on many  functions 
of PCs, including transmission of data, surfing the Web,  transmitting e-mail 
and instant messages, displaying digital  content, and exchanging data with 
internal corporate systems. The new mobile  platform also includes small, 
lightweight netbooks  optimized for wireless communication and Internet 
access, tablet  computers such as the iPad, and digital e-book readers such as 
Amazon’s Kindle with Web access capabilities.
Smartphones and tablet computers are becoming an important means 
of accessing the Internet. These devices are increasingly used for  business 
 computing as well as for consumer applications. For example, senior  executives 
at General Motors are using smartphone applications that drill down into 
vehicle sales information, financial performance, manufacturing metrics, and 
project management status. Wearable computing devices are another recent 
addition to the mobile digital  platform. These include smartwatches, smart 
glasses, smart badges, and activity trackers. Wearable computing technology 
is still in its infancy, but it already has business uses.
CONSUMERIZATION OF IT AND BYOD
The popularity, ease of use, and rich array of useful applications for 
 smartphones and tablet computers have created a groundswell of interest in 
allowing employees to use their personal mobile devices in the workplace, 
a phenomenon  popularly called “bring your own device” (BYOD). BYOD is one 
aspect of the consumerization of IT, in which new information technology 
that first emerges in the consumer market spreads into business organizations. 
Consumerization of IT includes not only mobile personal devices but also 
 business uses of  software services that originated in the consumer marketplace 
as well, such as Google and Yahoo search, Gmail, Google Apps, Dropbox (see 
Chapter 2), and even Facebook and Twitter.
Consumerization of IT is forcing businesses, especially large enterprises, to 
rethink the way they obtain and manage information technology equipment

What’s too hot to handle? It might very well be your 
company’s data center, which can easily consume 
more than 100 times more power than a standard 
office building. Data-hungry tasks such as video on 
demand, maintaining Web sites, or analyzing large 
pools of transactions or social media data require 
more and more power-hungry machines. Power and 
cooling costs for data centers have skyrocketed, with 
cooling a server requiring roughly the same number 
of kilowatts of energy as running one. All this addi-
tional power consumption has a negative impact on 
the environment as well as corporate operating costs.
Companies are now looking to green comput-
ing for solutions. The standard for measuring data 
center energy efficiency is power usage effective-
ness (PUE). This metric is a ratio of the total annual 
power consumed by a data center divided by how 
much is used annually by IT equipment. The lower 
the ratio, the better, with a PUE of 1.0 representing a 
desirable target. The PUE of traditional data centers 
has hovered around 2.0. That means the data center 
is using twice the amount of electricity that’s actu-
ally needed to do the computing. (The extra power is 
consumed by lighting, cooling, and other systems.) 
PUE is influenced by many factors, including hard-
ware efficiency, data center size, the types of servers 
and their uses, the proficiency of monitoring soft-
ware, building architecture, and the climate outside 
the facility. New data center designs with PUEs of 1.5 
or better are emerging
Virtualization is a highly effective tool for cost-
effective green computing because it reduces the 
number of servers and storage resources in the firm’s 
IT infrastructure. About five years ago, Acorda, a 
$210 million-per-year maker of drugs to treat nervous 
disorders such as multiple sclerosis, found it needed 
more servers and was outgrowing its data center. The 
company invested $100,000 in virtual servers run-
ning on technology from VMware. Using virtualiza-
tion, Acorda avoided spending an additional $1.5 mil-
lion on more physical servers and increasing energy 
consumption. Moreover, when the company moved 
to a new building in 2012, it was able to significantly 
shrink the size of its data center, further lowering 
cooling costs.
Acorda took additional steps to boost energy effi-
ciency at the new facility. The company installed 
motion sensors that shut off lights after five minutes 
if no movement is detected, and it invested in a 
more intelligent cooling system that automatically 
changes settings as conditions change. Current plans 
include replacing all of Acorda’s host servers and 
taking advantage of a VMware feature that moves 
virtual servers from one cluster to another, thereby 
reducing the number of clusters that require power 
at any given time. Acorda is also preparing to test 
virtualized desktops, which will greatly reduce the 
power required to run workstations and laptops.
Other tools and techniques are also available to 
make data centers more energy-efficient. Google 
and Microsoft have built data centers that take 
advantage of hydroelectric power. In April 2011 
Facebook publicly posted the specifications for the 
design of its data centers, including motherboards, 
power supply, server chassis, server rack, and bat-
tery cabinets, as well as data center electrical and 
mechanical construction specifications. Facebook 
hardware engineers re-thought the electric design, 
power distribution, and thermal design of its servers 
to optimize energy efficiency, reducing power usage 
by 13 percent. The power supply, which converts 
alternating current into direct current consumed by 
the motherboard, operates at 94.5 percent efficiency. 
Instead of using air conditioning or air ducts, the 
servers are cooled by evaporative cooling and mist-
ing machines, which flow air through grill-covered 
walls. The server racks are taller to provide for bigger 
heat sinks, and the data center’s large fans can move 
air through the servers more efficiently. Facebook’s 
engineers modified the programming in the servers 
to work with these larger fans and reduce their reli-
ance on small, individual fans that consume more 
power. This data center design, which has a 1.07 PUE 
rating, was implemented at Facebook’s Prineville, 
Oregon data center. All of these changes have 
reduced Facebook’s energy consumption per unit of 
computing power by 38 percent and operating costs 
by nearly 25 percent. The Prineville data center 
reports that its PUE is 1.07, one of the lowest.
By using ambient air cooling techniques and 
running warmer than average, Google’s newest 
data centers deliver a PUE rating of 1.16. Yahoo’s 
new Lockport, N.Y., data center has a PUE of 1.08. 
Lockport’s cool climate, prevailing winds, and hydro-
power help cool Yahoo’s 120 foot by 60 foot server 
buildings. FedEx located its energy-efficient Colorado

and services. Historically, at least in large firms, the IT department was 
responsible for selecting and managing the information technology and 
 applications used by the firm and its employees. It furnished employees with 
desktops or laptops that were able to access corporate systems securely. The 
IT department maintained control over the firm’s hardware and software to 
ensure that the business was being protected and that information systems 
served the purposes of the firm and its management. Today, employees and

data center at an elevation of 6,000 feet so that the 
building can be cooled using outside air instead of 
internal air conditioning.
In addition to lowering IT costs, using cloud com-
puting services may save energy as well. Cloud com-
puting centers pack in servers that have been opti-
mized for virtualization and for supporting as many 
different subscribing companies as possible. Cloud 
vendors are willing to invest heavily in cost-lowering 
virtualization software and energy-conserving server 
hardware because those efforts can produce major 
savings when doing the computing for large num-
bers of companies. A study by the Carbon Disclosure 
Project predicted that by 2020, large U.S. companies 
with revenues of more than $1 billion that used 
cloud computing would be able to achieve annual 
energy savings of $12.3 billion and annual carbon 
reductions equivalent to 200 million barrels of oil—
enough to power 5.7 million cars for one year.
Experts note that it’s important for companies to 
measure their energy use and inventory and track 
their information technology assets both before and 
after they start their green initiatives. And it isn’t 
always necessary to purchase new technologies to 
achieve “green” goals. Organizations can achieve siz-
able efficiencies by better managing the computing

resources they already have. Unfortunately, many 
information systems departments still aren’t deploy-
ing their existing technology resources efficiently or 
using green measurement tools. 
In 2015 and beyond, electricity demands to power 
data centers have never been higher, thanks to the 
continuing shift to the mobile platform. Experts pre-
dict there will be 15 billion mobile devices in use by 
year’s end, and other estimates suggest there may be 
50 billion by 2030. Meeting this considerable demand 
will require continued innovation in green comput-
ing to minimize environmental impact by any pos-
sible means.

business departments are playing a much larger role in technology  selection, 
in many cases demanding that employees be able to use their own personal 
 computers, smartphones, and tablets to access the corporate network. It is 
more difficult for the firm to manage and control these consumer technolo-
gies, and make sure they serve the needs of the business. The chapter-ending 
case study explores some of these management challenges created by BYOD 
and IT consumerization.
QUANTUM COMPUTING
Quantum computing is an emerging technology with the potential to dramati-
cally boost computer processing power to find answers to problems that would 
take conventional computers many years to solve. Quantum computing uses 
the principles of quantum physics to represent data and perform operations 
on these data. A quantum computer would gain enormous processing power 
through the ability to be in many different states at once, allowing it to perform 
multiple operations simultaneously and solve some scientific and business 
problems millions of times faster than can be done today. Researchers at IBM, 
MIT, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory have been working on quantum 
computing, and the aerospace firm Lockheed Martin has purchased a quantum 
computer for commercial use. 
VIRTUALIZATION
Virtualization is the process of presenting a set of computing resources 
(such as computing power or data storage) so that they can all be accessed in 
ways that are not restricted by physical configuration or geographic location. 
Virtualization enables a single physical resource (such as a server or a storage 
device) to appear to the user as multiple logical resources. For example, a server 
or mainframe can be configured to run many instances of an operating system 
(or different operating systems) so that it acts like many different machines. 
Each virtual server “looks” like a real physical server to software programs, and 
multiple virtual servers can run in parallel on a single machine. Virtualization 
also enables multiple physical resources (such as storage devices or servers) 
to appear as a single logical resource, as would be the case with storage area 
 networks. VMware is the leading virtualization software vendor for Windows 
and Linux servers. 
Server virtualization is a common method of reducing technology costs by 
providing the ability to host multiple systems on a single physical machine. 
Most servers run at just 15-20 percent of capacity, and virtualization can boost 
utilization server utilization rates to 70 percent or higher. Higher utilization 
rates translate into fewer computers required to process the same amount of 
work, reduced data center space to house machines, and lower energy usage. 
Virtualization also facilitates centralization and consolidation of hardware 
administration. It is now possible for companies and individuals to perform 
all of their computing work using a virtualized IT infrastructure in a remote 
 location, as is the case with cloud computing. 
CLOUD COMPUTING
Cloud computing is a model of computing in which computer processing, 
 storage, software, and other services are provided as a pool of virtualized 
resources over a network, primarily the Internet. These “clouds” of computing 
220 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

resources can be accessed on an as-needed basis from any connected device 
and location. Figure 5.10 illustrates the cloud computing concept.
The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud 
computing as having the following essential characteristics (Mell and Grance, 
2009):
• On-demand self-service: Consumers can obtain computing capabilities such 
as server time or network storage as needed automatically on their own.
• Ubiquitous network access: Cloud resources can be accessed using 
 standard network and Internet devices, including mobile platforms.
• Location-independent resource pooling: Computing resources are pooled 
to serve multiple users, with different virtual resources dynamically assigned 
according to user demand. The user generally does not know where the 
 computing resources are located.
• Rapid elasticity: Computing resources can be rapidly provisioned, 
increased, or decreased to meet changing user demand.
• Measured service: Charges for cloud resources are based on amount of 
resources actually used.
Cloud computing consists of three different types of services:
 FIGURE 5.10 CLOUD COMPUTING PLATFORM 
In cloud computing, hardware and software capabilities are a pool of virtualized resources provided 
over a network, often the Internet. Businesses and employees have access to applications and IT 
infrastructure anywhere, at any time, and on any device.
 
Chapter 5 IT Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies 
221

• Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):Customers use processing, storage, 
 networking, and other computing resources from cloud service providers to 
run their information systems. For example, Amazon uses the spare capac-
ity of its IT infrastructure to provide a broadly based cloud environment 
selling IT infrastructure services. These include its Simple Storage Service 
(S3) for  storing customers’ data and its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service 
for  running their applications. Users pay only for the amount of comput-
ing and storage capacity they actually use. (See the Interactive Session on 
Organizations). 
• Platform as a Service (PaaS): Customers use infrastructure and 
 programming tools supported by the cloud service provider to develop their 
own  applications. For example, IBM offers a Smart Business Application 
Development & Test service for software development and testing on the IBM 
Cloud. Another example is Salesforce.com’s Force.com, which allows develop-
ers to build  applications that are hosted on its servers as a service.
• Software as a Service (SaaS):Customers use software hosted by the vendor 
on the vendor’s cloud infrastructure and delivered over a network. Leading 
examples are Google Apps, which provides common business applications 
online and Salesforce.com, which also leases customer relationship manage-
ment and related software services over the Internet. Both charge users an 
annual subscription fee, although Google provides a free version of some of 
its business productivity tools. Users access these applications from a Web 
browser, and the data and software are maintained on the providers’ remote 
servers.
A cloud can be private or public. A public cloud is owned and maintained 
by a cloud service provider, such as Amazon Web Services, and made available 
to the general public or industry group. A private cloud is operated solely for 
an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and 
may exist on premise or off premise. Like public clouds, private clouds are able 
to allocate storage, computing power, or other resources seamlessly to provide 
computing resources on an as-needed basis. Companies that want flexible IT 
resources and a cloud service model while retaining control over their own IT 
infrastructure are gravitating toward these private clouds. (See the Interactive 
Session on Organizations.)
Since organizations using public clouds do not own the infrastructure, they 
do not have to make large investments in their own hardware and software. 
Instead, they purchase their computing services from remote providers and pay 
only for the amount of computing power they actually use (utility  computing) 
or are billed on a monthly or annual subscription basis. The term on-demand 
computing has also been used to describe such services.
Cloud computing has some drawbacks. Unless users make provisions for 
storing their data locally, the responsibility for data storage and control is in 
the hands of the provider. Some companies worry about the security risks 
related to entrusting their critical data and systems to an outside vendor 
that also works with other companies. Companies expect their systems to 
be available 24/7 and do not want to suffer any loss of business capability if 
cloud infrastructures malfunction. Nevertheless, the trend is for companies 
to shift more of their computer  processing and storage to some form of cloud 
infrastructure. 
Cloud computing is more immediately appealing to small and medium-
sized businesses that lack resources to purchase and own their own hardware 
and software. However, large corporations have huge investments in complex 
 proprietary systems supporting unique business processes, some of which give 
222 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

Cloud computing is taking off. The biggest players in 
the cloud computing marketplace include Amazon 
Web Services division (AWS), Microsoft, and Google. 
These companies have streamlined cloud comput-
ing and made it an affordable and sensible option 
for companies ranging from tiny Internet startups to 
established companies like FedEx.
For example, AWS provides subscribing compa-
nies with flexible computing power and data storage, 
as well as data management, messaging, payment, 
and other services that can be used together or 
 individually as the business requires. Anyone with 
an Internet connection and a little bit of money can 
harness the same computing systems that Amazon 
itself uses to run its retail business. If customers 
 provide the amount of server space, bandwidth, 
 storage, and any other services they require, AWS 
can automatically allocate those resources. Amazon’s 
sales pitch is that you don’t pay a monthly or yearly 
fee to use their computing resources – instead, you 
pay for exactly what you use. 
This appeals to many businesses because it 
allows Amazon to handle all of the maintenance 
and upkeep of IT infrastructures, leaving busi-
nesses to spend more time on higher-value work. 
For example, using AWS helped Merrifield Garden 
Center reduce costs, improve the stability and 
 security of its applications and data, and eliminate 
the burden of managing IT infrastructure hardware 
so it can focus on new customer-facing initiatives to 
grow the business.
Startup companies and smaller companies are 
finding that they no longer need to build their own 
data center. With cloud infrastructures like Amazon’s 
readily available, they have access to technical capa-
bility that was formerly available to only much larger 
businesses. San Francisco-based Socialcam provides 
a popular mobile social video application currently 
installed on over 20 million iPhone and Android 
smartphones. The Socialcam application makes it 
easy to take a video of any size, post it online, and 
share with friends. Socialcam became so popular that 
the company’s engineers couldn’t install hardware 
fast enough to keep up with demand. By moving to 
the AWS Cloud, Socialcam can quickly add or remove 
capacity to meet demand. Netco Sports produces 
the Canal+ Football app that enables viewers to 
replay any move from any camera angle, on any 
device, within 3 minutes after it happens. By using 
AWS, Netco Sports can scale 100 servers in under 10 
 minutes to support streaming for 500,000 viewers.
Until recently, banks have been reluctant to use 
public cloud services due to security and regulatory 
concerns, but shrinking profits are encouraging them 
to take a second look. In the meantime, some banks 
are using private clouds for their sensitive financial 
transactions. National Australia Bank (NAB), with 
$793 billion in assets, uses an internal private cloud 
based on IBM’s infrastructure on demand. IBM had 
already been managing the bank’s IT infrastructure 
under a seven-year contract signed in 2010. The pri-
vate cloud hosts the bank’s main production environ-
ment, including a new Oracle banking system, and 
will support short-term computing-intense projects 
such as marketing campaigns. NAB pays only for 
what it uses so that it doesn’t have to make large IT 
capital expenditures. The equipment is all hosted in 
NAB’s data centers, which is unusual for on-demand 
environments.
Although low overhead and infrastructure 
 management costs make public cloud computing 
especially attractive to startups, the financial benefits 
of cloud computing for large and midsized organi-
zations are less apparent. Cliff Olson, director of 
infrastructure systems at FP International, Inc., a 
Fremont, California-based packaging company, notes 
that paying a public cloud provider a monthly ser-
vice fee for 10,000 or more employees will probably 
be more expensive than having the company main-
tain its own IT infrastructure and staff. Companies 
also worry about unexpected “runaway costs” from 
using a pay-per-use model. Integrating cloud services 
with existing IT infrastructures, errors, mismanage-
ment, or unusually high volumes of Web traffic will 
run up the bill for cloud service users.
Gartner Inc. technology consultants advises 
 clients contemplating public cloud services to take 
into account the number of machines an organiza-
tion will run; the number of hours per day or per 
week they’ll run; and the amount of storage their 
data will require. Additional costs include licenses 
that need to be paid for on a recurring basis; the 
rate of change for the data; and how much new data 
the business is expected to generate. A very large 
 company may find it cheaper to own and manage 
its own data center or private cloud. But as public

them strategic advantages. The cost savings from switching to cloud services 
are not always easy to determine for large companies that already have their 
own IT infrastructures in place. Corporate data centers typically work with an 
IT budget that accounts for a mix of operational and capital expenses. Pricing 
for cloud services is usually based on a per-hour or other per-use charge. Even 
if a company can approximate the hardware and software costs to run a specific 
computing task on premises, it still needs to figure in how much of the firm’s 
network management, storage management, system administration, electric-
ity, and real estate costs should be allocated to a single on-premises IT  service. 
An information systems department may not have the right information to 
 analyze those factors on a service-by-service basis.

these concepts both to Amazon and to 
 subscribers of its services.
clouds become more efficient and secure and the 
technology grows cheaper, large companies will start 
using more cloud resources. 
A major barrier to widespread cloud adoption 
is concern about cloud reliability and security. 
Amazon’s cloud experienced significant outages in 
April and August 2011; on June 14 and 29, 2012; on 
December 24, 2012; on January 31, 2013; and on 
August 25, 2013. Normally, cloud networks are very 
reliable, and often more so than private  networks 
operated by individual companies. But when a 
cloud of significant size like Amazon’s goes down, 
it sends ripples across the entire Web. The August 
2013 outage was caused by a hardware  failure 
 lasting 49 minutes at Amazon’s U.S.-East data c enter 
in North Virginia. It led to spiraling problems at a 
host of well-trafficked online services, including 
Instagram, Vine, AirBnB, and the mobile maga-
zine app Flipboard. Amazon attributed the  outage 
to glitches with a single networking device that 
resulted in data loss. 
The outages have been proof that the vision of 
a cloud with 100 percent uptime is still far from 
 reality. Nevertheless, some large cloud users such as 
Netflix believe that overall cloud service availability 
and reliability have steadily improved. A number of 
4. What kinds of businesses are most likely to 
benefit from using cloud computing? Why?
experts recommend that companies for whom an 
outage would be a major risk consider using another 
computing service as a backup.
Most midsized and large companies will 
 gravitate toward a hybrid approach. For example, 
InterContinental Hotels revamped its IT infra-
structure to include both private and public cloud 
usage. To improve response time for customers, 
InterContinental moved its core room reservation 
transaction system onto a private cloud within its 
own data center, but it moved room availability and 
pricing Web site applications onto public cloud data 
centers on the East and West coasts. Customers 
receive data faster if the data are located on a server 
that is physically close to them, and cloud computing 
helps InterContinental to take advantage of this.

Large firms are most likely to adopt a hybrid cloud computing model 
where they use their own infrastructure for their most essential core 
 activities and adopt public cloud computing for less-critical systems or for 
additional processing capacity during peak business periods. Cloud comput-
ing will gradually shift firms from having a fixed infrastructure capacity 
toward a more flexible infrastructure, some of it owned by the firm, and 
some of it rented from giant computer centers owned by computer  hardware 
vendors. You can find out more about cloud computing in the Learning 
Tracks for this chapter.
GREEN COMPUTING
By curbing hardware proliferation and power consumption, virtualization has 
become one of the principal technologies for promoting green computing. 
Green computing or green IT, refers to practices and technologies for design-
ing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of computers, servers, and associ-
ated devices such as monitors, printers, storage devices, and networking and 
 communications systems to minimize impact on the environment.
Reducing computer power consumption has been a very high “green” 
 priority. Information technology is responsible for about 2 percent of total 
U.S. power demand and is believed to contribute about 2 percent of the world’s 
greenhouse gases. A corporate data center can easily consume more than 100 
times more power than a standard office building. All this additional power 
consumption has a negative impact on the environment and corporate operat-
ing costs. The chapter-opening case on Portugal Telecom illustrates some of 
the technologies and data center design considerations for green computing 
and the business and environmental benefits of cutting power consumption 
in the data center. 
HIGH-PERFORMANCE AND POWER-SAVING 
PROCESSORS
Another way to reduce power requirements and hardware sprawl is to use more 
efficient and power-saving processors. Contemporary microprocessors now 
 feature multiple processor cores (which perform the reading and  execution of 
computer instructions) on a single chip. A multicore processor is an integrated 
circuit to which two or more processor cores have been attached for enhanced 
performance, reduced power consumption, and more efficient simultaneous 
processing of multiple tasks. This technology enables two or more process-
ing engines with reduced power requirements and heat dissipation to perform 
tasks faster than a resource-hungry chip with a single processing core. Today 
you’ll find PCs with dual-core, quad-core, six-core, and eight core processors 
and servers with 16-core processors.
Intel and other chip manufacturers have developed microprocessors that 
minimize power consumption, which is essential for prolonging battery life in 
small mobile digital devices. You will now find highly power-efficient micro-
processors, such as the A6 and A7 processors used in the Apple iPhone and 
iPad, and Intel’s Atom processor for netbooks and mobile Internet devices. 
The Apple micrprocessors have about one-fiftieth the power consumption 
of a laptop  dual-core processor. Intel recently unveiled a line of ultrasmall 
 low-power microprocessors called Quark that can be used in wearable devices, 
skin patches, or even swallowed to gather medical data.

WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS IN COMPUTER 
SOFTWARE PLATFORMS?
There are four major themes in contemporary software platform evolution:
• Linux and open source software
• Java, HTML, and HTML5
• Web services and service-oriented architecture
• Software outsourcing and cloud services
LINUX AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
Open source software is software produced by a community of several 
 hundred thousand programmers around the world. According to the leading 
open source professional association, OpenSource.org, open source software 
is free and can be modified by users. Works derived from the original code 
must also be free, and the software can be redistributed by the user without 
additional licensing. Open source software is by definition not restricted to any 
specific operating system or hardware technology, although most open source 
software is currently based on a Linux or Unix operating system.
The open source movement has been evolving for more than 30 years and 
has demonstrated that it can produce commercially acceptable, high-quality 
software. Popular open source software tools include the Linux operating 
system, the Apache HTTP Web server, the Mozilla Firefox Web browser, and 
the Apache OpenOffice desktop productivity suite. Google’s Android mobile 
operating system and Chrome Web browser are based on open source tools. 
You can find out more out more about the Open Source Definition from 
the Open Source Initiative and the history of open source software at the 
Learning Tracks for this chapter.
Linux
Perhaps the most well-known open source software is Linux, an operating system 
related to Unix. Linux was created by the Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds 
and first posted on the Internet in August 1991. Linux applications are embedded 
in cell phones, smartphones, tablet computers and consumer electronics. Linux 
is available in free versions downloadable from the Internet or in low-cost com-
mercial versions that include tools and support from vendors such as Red Hat.
Although Linux is not used in many desktop systems, it is a leading operat-
ing system on servers, mainframe computers, and supercomputers. Linux has 
become the operating system of choice in the high performance computing 
market, powering 97 percent of the world’s fastest computers. IBM, HP, Intel, 
Dell, and Oracle have made Linux a central part of their offerings to corpora-
tions. The popular Android operating system for mobile devices has a Linux 
foundation.
The rise of open source software, particularly Linux and the applications 
it supports, has profound implications for corporate software platforms: cost 
reduction, reliability and resilience, and integration, because Linux works on 
all the major hardware platforms from mainframes to servers to clients.
SOFTWARE FOR THE WEB: JAVA, HTML, AND HTML5
Java is an operating system-independent, processor-independent, object-
oriented programming language that has become the leading interactive 
226 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

environment for the Web. Java was created by James Gosling and the Green 
Team at Sun Microsystems in 1992. In November 13, 2006, Sun released much 
of Java as open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public 
License (GPL), completing the process on May 8, 2007.
The Java platform has migrated into cell phones, smartphones,  automobiles, 
music players, game machines, and into set-top cable television  systems  serving 
interactive content and pay-per-view services. Java  software is designed to run 
on any computer or computing device, regardless of the  specific microproces-
sor or operating system the device uses. Java is the most popular development 
platform for mobile devices running the Android operating system. For each 
of the computing environments in which Java is used, Sun created a Java 
Virtual Machine that interprets Java programming code for that machine. In 
this manner, the code is written once and can be used on any machine for 
which there exists a Java Virtual Machine.
Java developers can create small applet programs that can be embedded 
in Web pages and downloaded to run on a Web browser. A Web browser is 
an easy-to-use software tool with a graphical user interface for displaying Web 
pages and for accessing the Web and other Internet resources. Microsoft’s 
Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome browser are examples. 
At the enterprise level, Java is being used for more complex e-commerce and
e-business applications that require communication with an organization’s 
back-end transaction processing systems.
HTML and HTML5
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a page description language for 
specifying how text, graphics, video, and sound are placed on a Web page and 
for creating dynamic links to other Web pages and objects. Using these links, 
a user need only point at a highlighted keyword or graphic, click on it, and 
 immediately be transported to another document.
HTML was originally designed to create and link static documents  composed 
largely of text. Today, however, the Web is much more social and interactive, 
and many Web pages have multimedia elements—images, audio, and video. 
Third-party plug-in applications like Flash, Silverlight, and Java have been 
required to integrate these rich media with Web pages. However, these  add-ons 
require additional programming and put strains on computer  processing. The 
 next evolution of HTML, called HTML5, solves this  problem by making it 
 possible to embed images, audio, video, and other elements directly into a 
document without processor-intensive add-ons. HTML5 makes it easier for 
Web pages to function across different display devices, including mobile 
devices as well as desktops, and it will support the storage of data offline for 
apps that run over the Web. Other popular programming tools for Web appli-
cations include Ruby and Python. Ruby is an object-oriented  programming 
language known for speed and ease of use in building Web applications and 
Python (praised for its clarity) is being used for building cloud computing 
applications. Major Web sites such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter 
use Python and Ruby as well as Java.
WEB SERVICES AND SERVICE-ORIENTED 
ARCHITECTURE
Web services refer to a set of loosely coupled software components that 
exchange information with each other using universal Web communication 
 
Chapter 5 IT Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies 
227

standards and languages. They can exchange information between two  different 
systems regardless of the operating systems or programming  languages 
on which the systems are based. They can be used to build open standard
Web-based applications linking systems of two different organizations, and 
they can also be used to create applications that link disparate systems within 
a single company. Web services are not tied to any one operating system or 
programming language, and different applications can use them to commu-
nicate with each other in a standard way without time-consuming custom 
coding.
The foundation technology for Web services is XML, which stands for Extensible 
Markup Language. This language was developed in 1996 by the World Wide Web 
Consortium (W3C, the international body that oversees the development of the 
Web) as a more powerful and flexible markup language than hypertext markup 
language (HTML) for Web pages. Whereas HTML is limited to describing how data 
should be presented in the form of Web pages, XML can perform presentation, 
communication, and storage of data. In XML, a number is not simply a number; 
the XML tag specifies whether the number represents a price, a date, or a ZIP 
code. Table 5.2 illustrates some sample XML statements.
By tagging selected elements of the content of documents for their meanings, 
XML makes it possible for computers to manipulate and interpret their data 
automatically and perform operations on the data without human intervention. 
Web browsers and computer programs, such as order processing or enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) software, can follow programmed rules for applying 
and displaying the data. XML provides a standard format for data exchange, 
enabling Web services to pass data from one process to another.
Web services communicate through XML messages over standard Web 
protocols. Companies discover and locate Web services through a direc-
tory much as they would locate services in the Yellow Pages of a telephone 
book. Using Web protocols, a software application can connect freely to other 
 applications without custom programming for each different application 
with which it wants to communicate. Everyone shares the same standards.
The collection of Web services that are used to build a firm’s software 
 systems constitutes what is known as a service-oriented architecture. A 
service-oriented architecture (SOA) is set of self-contained services that 
communicate with each other to create a working software application. 
Business tasks are accomplished by executing a series of these services. 
Software developers reuse these services in other combinations to assemble 
other applications as needed.
Virtually all major software vendors provide tools and entire platforms for 
building and integrating software applications using Web services. IBM includes 
Web service tools in its WebSphere e-business software platform, and Microsoft 
has incorporated Web services tools in its Microsoft .NET platform.

Dollar Rent A Car’s systems use Web services for its online booking system 
with Southwest Airlines’ Web site. Although both companies’ systems are based 
on different technology platforms, a person booking a flight on Southwest.com 
can reserve a car from Dollar without leaving the airline’s Web site. Instead 
of struggling to get Dollar’s reservation system to share data with Southwest’s 
information systems, Dollar used Microsoft .NET Web services technology as 
an intermediary. Reservations from Southwest are translated into Web services 
protocols, which are then translated into formats that can be understood by 
Dollar’s computers.
Other car rental companies have linked their information systems to  airline 
companies’ Web sites before. But without Web services, these connections 
had to be built one at a time. Web services provide a standard way for Dollar’s 
 computers to “talk” to other companies’ information systems without having to 
build special links to each one. Dollar is now expanding its use of Web services 
to link directly to the systems of a small tour operator and a large travel reserva-
tion system as well as a wireless Web site for cell phones and smartphones. It 
does not have to write new software code for each new partner’s information 
systems or each new wireless device (see Figure 5.11).
SOFTWARE OUTSOURCING AND CLOUD SERVICES
Today, many business firms continue to operate legacy systems that continue 
to meet a business need and that would be extremely costly to replace. But they 
will purchase or rent most of their new software applications from external 
sources. Figure 5.12 illustrates the rapid growth in external sources of software 
for U.S. firms.
 FIGURE 5.11 HOW DOLLAR RENT A CAR USES WEB SERVICES
Dollar Rent A Car uses Web services to provide a standard intermediate layer of software to “talk” to 
other companies’ information systems. Dollar Rent A Car can use this set of Web services to link to 
other companies’ information systems without having to build a separate link to each firm’s systems.
 
Chapter 5 IT Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies

There are three external sources for software: software packages from a 
 commercial software vendor, outsourcing custom application development 
to an external vendor, (which may or may not be offshore), and cloud-based 
 software services and tools.
Software Packages and Enterprise Software
We have already described software packages for enterprise applications as one 
of the major types of software components in contemporary IT infrastructures. 
A software package is a prewritten commercially available set of software 
 programs that eliminates the need for a firm to write its own software programs 
for certain functions, such as payroll processing or order handling.
Enterprise application software vendors such as SAP and Oracle-PeopleSoft 
have developed powerful software packages that can support the  primary 
 business processes of a firm worldwide from warehousing, customer 
 relationship management, and supply chain management, to finance and 
human resources. These large-scale enterprise software systems provide a 
single, integrated, worldwide software system for firms at a cost much less 
than they would pay if they developed it themselves. Chapter 9 discusses 
enterprise systems in detail.
Software Outsourcing
Software outsourcing enables a firm to contract custom software develop-
ment or maintenance of existing legacy programs to outside firms, which often 
 operate offshore in low-wage areas of the world. According to industry  analysts, 
spending on global IT outsourcing services was approximately $440 billion in 
2014 (Kanaracus, 2014).
 FIGURE 5.12 CHANGING SOURCES OF FIRM SOFTWARE
In 2014, U.S. firms will spend over $279 billion on software. About 35 percent of that will originate 
outside the firm, either from enterprise software vendors selling firmwide applications or individual 
application service providers leasing or selling software modules. Another 4 percent ($11 billion) will 
be provided by SaaS vendors as an online cloud-based service.

For example, Cemex, Mexico's largest cement manufacturer, signed a 10-year 
$1 billion outsourcing deal with IBM in July 2012. Under the deal, IBM respon-
sibilities include application development and maintenance as well as IT 
 infrastructure management at Cemex company headquarters in Monterrey, 
Mexico, and around the globe. IBM will take over and run Cemex's finance, 
accounting, and human resources systems (McDougall, 2012). 
Offshore software outsourcing firms have primarily provided lower-level 
maintenance, data entry, and call center operations, although more sophisti-
cated and experienced offshore firms, particularly in India, have been hired 
for new-program development. However, as wages offshore rise, and the costs 
of managing offshore projects are factored in (see Chapter 13), some work that 
would have been sent offshore is returning to domestic companies.
Cloud-Based Software Services and Tools
In the past, software such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Illustrator came in a box 
and was designed to operate on a single machine. Today, you’re more likely to 
download the software from the vendor’s Web site, or to use the software as a 
cloud service delivered over the Internet.
Cloud-based software and the data it uses are hosted on powerful servers 
in massive data centers, and can be accessed with an Internet connection and 
 standard Web browser. In addition to free or low-cost tools for individuals and 
small businesses provided by Google or Yahoo, enterprise software and other 
complex business functions are available as services from the major commercial 
software vendors. Instead of buying and installing software programs,  subscribing 
companies rent the same functions from these services, with users paying either 
on a subscription or per-transaction basis. Services for delivering and providing 
access to software remotely as a Web-based service are now referred to as soft-
ware as a service (SaaS). A leading example is Salesforce.com, which provides 
on-demand software services for customer relationship management.
In order to manage their relationship with an outsourcer or technology 
 service provider, firms need a contract that includes a service level  agreement 
(SLA). The SLA is a formal contract between customers and their service 
 providers that defines the specific responsibilities of the service provider 
and the level of service expected by the customer. SLAs typically specify the 
nature and level of services provided, criteria for performance measurement, 
 support options, provisions for security and disaster recovery, hardware and 
software  ownership and upgrades, customer support, billing, and conditions for 
 terminating the agreement. We provide a Learning Track on this topic.
Mashups and Apps
The software you use for both personal and business tasks may consist of large 
self-contained programs, or it may be composed of interchangeable compo-
nents that integrate freely with other applications on the Internet. Individual 
users and entire companies mix and match these software  components to 
create their own customized applications and to share information with 
others. The resulting software applications are called mashups. The idea is 
to take different sources and produce a new work that is “greater than” the 
sum of its parts. You have performed a mashup if you’ve ever personalized 
your Facebook profile or your blog with a capability to display videos or slide 
shows.
Web mashups combine the capabilities of two or more online applications 
to create a kind of hybrid that provides more customer value than the  original 
sources alone. For instance, ZipRealty uses Google Maps and data provided by 
 
Chapter 5 IT Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies 
231

online real estate database Zillow.com to display a complete list of  multiple 
listing service (MLS) real estate listings for any zip code specified by the user. 
Amazon uses mashup technologies to aggregate product descriptions with 
 partner sites and user profiles.
Apps are small specialized software programs that run on the Internet, on 
your  computer, or on your mobile phone or tablet and are generally delivered 
over the Internet. Google refers to its online services as apps, including the 
Google Apps suite of desktop productivity tools. But when we talk about apps 
today, most of the attention goes to the apps that have been developed for the 
mobile digital  platform. It is these apps that turn smartphones and other mobile 
 handheld devices into general-purpose computing tools.
Some downloaded apps do not access the Web but many do, providing 
faster access to Web content than traditional Web browsers. They provide a 
 non-browser pathway for users to experience the Web and perform a number of 
tasks, ranging from reading the newspaper to shopping, searching, and buying. 
Because so many people are now accessing the Internet from their mobile 
devices, some say that apps are “the new browsers.” Apps are also starting to 
influence the design and function of traditional Web sites as consumers are 
attracted to the look and feel of apps and their speed of operation. 
Many apps are free or purchased for a small charge, much less than 
 conventional software, which further adds to their appeal. There are already 
over 1 million apps for the Apple iPhone and iPad platform and a similar 
number that run on devices using Google’s Android operating system. The 
 success of these mobile platforms depends in large part on the quantity and the 
quality of the apps they provide. Apps tie the customer to a specific hardware 
platform: As the user adds more and more apps to his or her mobile phone, the 
cost of switching to a competing mobile platform rises.
At the moment, the most commonly downloaded apps are games, news and 
weather, maps/navigation, social networking, music, and video/movies. But 
there are also serious apps for business users that make it possible to create and 
edit documents, connect to corporate systems, schedule and participate in meet-
ings, track shipments, and dictate voice messages (see the Chapter 1 Interactive 
Session on Management). There are also a huge number of  e-commerce apps 
for researching and buying goods and services online.

WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES OF MANAGING IT 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT 
SOLUTIONS?
Creating and managing a coherent IT infrastructure raises multiple challenges: 
dealing with platform and technology change (including cloud and mobile 
computing), management and governance, and making wise infrastructure 
investments.
DEALING WITH PLATFORM AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
CHANGE
As firms grow, they often quickly outgrow their infrastructure. As firms shrink, 
they can get stuck with excessive infrastructure purchased in better times. How 
can a firm remain flexible when most of the investments in IT infrastructure 
are fixed-cost purchases and licenses? How well does the infrastructure scale? 
232 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

Scalability refers to the ability of a computer, product, or system to expand 
to serve a large number of users without breaking down. New applications, 
mergers and acquisitions, and changes in business volume all impact computer 
workload and must be considered when planning hardware capacity.
Firms using mobile computing and cloud computing platforms will require 
new policies and procedures for managing these platforms. They will need to 
inventory all of their mobile devices in business use and develop policies and 
tools for tracking, updating, and securing them and for controlling the data 
and applications that run on them. Firms using cloud computing and SaaS 
will need to fashion new contractual arrangements with remote vendors to 
make sure that the hardware and software for critical applications are always 
available when needed and that they meet corporate standards for informa-
tion security. It is up to business management to determine acceptable levels 
of computer response time and availability for the firm’s mission-critical 
 systems to maintain the level of business performance they expect.
MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE
A long-standing issue among information system managers and CEOs has 
been the question of who will control and manage the firm’s IT infrastruc-
ture. Chapter 2 introduced the concept of IT governance and described some 
issues it addresses. Other important questions about IT governance are: Should 
departments and divisions have the responsibility of making their own infor-
mation technology decisions or should IT infrastructure be centrally controlled 
and managed? What is the relationship between central information systems 
management and business unit information systems management? How will 
infrastructure costs be allocated among business units? Each organization will 
need to arrive at answers based on its own needs.
MAKING WISE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS
IT infrastructure is a major investment for the firm. If too much is spent on 
infrastructure, it lies idle and constitutes a drag on the firm’s financial perfor-
mance. If too little is spent, important business services cannot be delivered 
and the firm’s competitors (who spent just the right amount) will outperform 
the  under-investing firm. How much should the firm spend on infrastructure? 
This question is not easy to answer.
A related question is whether a firm should purchase and maintain its own 
IT infrastructure components or rent them from external suppliers,  including 
those offering cloud services. The decision either to purchase your own IT 
assets or rent them from external providers is typically called the rent-versus-
buy decision.
Cloud computing may be a low-cost way to increase scalability and flexibility, 
but firms should evaluate this option carefully in light of security requirements 
and impact on business processes and workflows. In some instances, the cost of 
renting software adds up to more than purchasing and maintaining an applica-
tion in-house. Yet there may be benefits to using cloud services, if this allows 
the company to focus on core business issues instead of technology challenges.
Total Cost of Ownership of Technology Assets
The actual cost of owning technology resources includes the original cost of 
acquiring and installing hardware and software, as well as ongoing adminis-
tration costs for hardware and software upgrades, maintenance, technical 
 
Chapter 5 IT Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies 
233

 support, training, and even utility and real estate costs for running and hous-
ing the technology. The total cost of ownership (TCO) model can be used to 
 analyze these direct and indirect costs to help firms determine the actual cost 
of  specific technology implementations. Table 5.3 describes the most important 
TCO  components to consider in a TCO analysis.
When all these cost components are considered, the TCO for a PC might 
run up to three times the original purchase price of the equipment. Although 
the purchase price of a wireless handheld for a corporate employee may run 
several hundred dollars, the TCO for each device is much higher, ranging from 
$1,000 to $3,000, according to various consultant estimates. Gains in productiv-
ity and efficiency from equipping employees with mobile computing devices 
must be balanced against increased costs from integrating these devices into 
the firm’s IT infrastructure and from providing technical support. Other cost 
components include fees for wireless airtime, end-user training, help desk 
support, and  software for special applications. Costs are higher if the mobile 
devices run many different applications or need to be integrated into back-end 
systems such as enterprise applications.
Hardware and software acquisition costs account for only about 20 percent 
of TCO, so managers must pay close attention to administration costs to under-
stand the full cost of the firm’s hardware and software. It is possible to reduce 
some of these administration costs through better management. Many large 
firms are saddled with redundant, incompatible hardware and software because 
their departments and divisions have been allowed to make their own technol-
ogy purchases.
In addition to switching to cloud services, these firms could reduce their 
TCO through greater centralization and standardization of their hardware 
and software resources. Companies could reduce the size of the informa-
tion  systems staff required to support their infrastructure if the firm mini-
mizes the number of different computer models and pieces of software that 
employees are allowed to use. In a centralized infrastructure, systems can be 
 administered from a  central location and troubleshooting can be performed 
from that location.

Figure 5.13 illustrates a competitive forces model you can use to address the 
question of how much your firm should spend on IT infrastructure.
Market demand for your firm’s services. Make an inventory of the services 
you currently provide to customers, suppliers, and employees. Survey each 
group, or hold focus groups to find out if the services you currently offer are 
meeting the needs of each group. For example, are customers complaining of 
slow responses to their queries about price and availability? Are employees 
complaining about the difficulty of finding the right information for their jobs? 
Are suppliers complaining about the difficulties of discovering your production 
requirements?
Your firm’s business strategy. Analyze your firm’s five-year business strategy 
and try to assess what new services and capabilities will be required to achieve 
strategic goals.
Your firm’s IT strategy, infrastructure, and cost. Examine your firm’s 
 information technology plans for the next five years and assess its alignment 
with the firm’s business plans. Determine the total IT infrastructure costs. You 
will want to perform a TCO analysis. If your firm has no IT strategy, you will 
need to devise one that takes into account the firm’s five-year strategic plan.
Information technology assessment. Is your firm behind the technology 
curve or at the bleeding edge of information technology? Both situations are to 
be avoided. It is usually not desirable to spend resources on advanced technolo-

gies that are still experimental, often expensive, and sometimes unreliable. You 
want to spend on technologies for which standards have been established and 
IT vendors are competing on cost, not design, and where there are multiple 
suppliers. However, you do not want to put off investment in new technologies 
or allow competitors to develop new business models and capabilities based on 
the new technologies.
Competitor firm services. Try to assess what technology services competitors 
offer to customers, suppliers, and employees. Establish quantitative and qualita-
tive measures to compare them to those of your firm. If your firm’s service 
levels fall short, your company is at a competitive disadvantage. Look for ways 
your firm can excel at service levels.
Competitor firm IT infrastructure investments. Benchmark your expendi-
tures for IT infrastructure against your competitors. Many companies are quite 
public about their innovative expenditures on IT. If competing firms try to keep 
IT expenditures secret, you may be able to find IT investment information in 
public companies’ SEC Form 10-K annual reports to the federal government 
when those expenditures impact a firm’s financial results.
Your firm does not necessarily need to spend as much as, or more than, your 
competitors. Perhaps it has discovered much less-expensive ways of providing 
services, and this can lead to a cost advantage. Alternatively, your firm may 
be spending far less than competitors and experiencing commensurate poor 
 performance and losing market share.
Review Summary
1. What is IT infrastructure and what are the stages and drivers of IT infrastructure evolution?
IT infrastructure is the shared technology resources that provide the platform for the firm’s  specific 
information system applications. IT infrastructure includes hardware, software, and services that are 
shared across the entire firm. 
The five stages of IT infrastructure evolution are: the mainframe era, the personal computer era, 
the client/server era, the enterprise computing era, and the cloud and mobile computing era. Moore’s 
Law deals with the exponential increase in processing power and decline in the cost of computer 
technology, stating that every 18 months the power of microprocessors doubles and the price of 
 computing falls in half. The Law of Mass Digital Storage deals with the exponential decrease in the 
cost of storing data, stating that the number of kilobytes of data that can be stored on magnetic media 
for $1 roughly doubles every 15 months. Metcalfe’s Law states that a network’s value to  participants 
grows exponentially as the network takes on more members. The rapid decline in costs of communi-
cation and growing agreement in the technology industry to use computing and communications 
standards is also driving an explosion of computer use.
2. What are the components of IT infrastructure?
Major IT infrastructure components include computer hardware platforms, operating system 
 platforms, enterprise software platforms, networking and telecommunications platforms, database 
management software, Internet platforms, and consulting services and systems integrators.
3. What are the current trends in computer hardware platforms?
Increasingly, computing is taking place on a mobile digital platform. Quantum computing is an 
emerging technology that could dramatically boost processing power through the ability to be in 
more than one state at the same time. Consumerization of IT is the business use of information 
 technology that originated in the consumer market. Virtualization organizes computing resources so 
that their use is not restricted by physical configuration or geographic  location. In cloud computing, 
firms and individuals obtain computing power and software as services over a network, including the 
Internet, rather than purchasing and installing the hardware and  software on their own computers. A 
236 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

multicore processor is a microprocessor to which two or more processing cores have been attached for 
enhanced performance. Green computing includes practices and technologies for producing, using, and 
 disposing of information technology hardware to  minimize negative impact on the environment. 
4. What are the current trends in computer software platforms?
Open source software is produced and maintained by a global community of programmers and is often 
downloadable for free. Linux is a powerful, resilient open source operating system that can run on multiple 
hardware platforms and is used widely to run Web servers. Java is an operating-system– and hardware-inde-
pendent programming language that is the leading interactive programming  environment for the Web. 
HTML5 makes it possible to embed images, audio, and video directly into a Web document without add-on 
programs. Web services are loosely coupled software components based on open Web standards that work 
with any application software and operating system. They can be used as components of Web-based applica-
tions linking the systems of two different organizations or to link disparate systems of a single company. 
Companies are purchasing their new software applications from outside sources, including software  packages, 
by outsourcing custom application development to an external vendor (that may be offshore), or by renting 
online software services (SaaS). Mashups combine two different software services to create new  software 
applications and services. Apps are small pieces of software that run on the Internet, on a computer, or on a 
mobile phone and are generally delivered over the Internet.
5. What are the challenges of managing IT infrastructure and management solutions?
Major challenges include dealing with platform and infrastructure change, infrastructure  management 
and governance, and making wise infrastructure investments. Solution guidelines include using a competi-
tive forces model to determine how much to spend on IT infrastructure and where to make strategic infra-
structure investments, and establishing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of information technology assets. 
The total cost of owning technology resources includes not only the original cost of computer hardware and 
software but also costs for hardware and software upgrades, maintenance, technical support, and training.

Hischornklinik Group is a leading private medical clinic group in Germany. It relies on information 
systems to operate 14 hospitals, as well as hundreds of specialist institutes. Demand for additional servers 
and storage technology is growing by 20 percent each year. Hischornklinik was setting up a separate 
server for every application, and its servers and other computers were running a number of different 
operating systems, including several versions of UNIX and Windows. Hischornklinik had to manage tech-
nologies from many different vendors, including Hewlett-Packard (HP), Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, and 
IBM. Assess the impact of this situation on business performance. What factors and management deci-
sions must be considered when developing a solution to this problem?

The Pleasures and Pitfalls of BYOD
CASE STUDY
J
ust about everyone who has a smartphone 
wants to be able to bring it to work and use it on 
the job. And why not? Employees using their 
own smartphones would allow  companies 
to enjoy all of the same benefits of a mobile work-
force without spending their own money to purchase 
these devices. Smaller companies are able to go 
mobile without making large investments in devices 
and mobile services. One IBM-sponsored study by 
Forrester Consulting found that a BYOD program 
using mobile enterprise services from IBM achieved a 
108 percent return on investment and  payback within 
one month. “Anywhere/anytime” access to comput-
ing tools increased workplace  productivity and raised 
effective employee work time by 45–60 minutes per 
week. According to Gartner Inc., by 2017, 50  percent 
of employers will require employees to supply their 
own mobile devices for the workplace. BYOD is 
becoming the “new normal.”
But...wait a minute. Nearly three out of five 
enterprises believe that BYOD represents a grow-
ing problem for their organizations, according to a 
survey of 162 enterprises conducted by Osterman 
Research on behalf of Dell Inc. Although BYOD can 
improve employee job satisfaction and productivity, 
it also can cause a number of problems if not man-
aged properly: support for personally owned devices 
is more difficult than it is for company-supplied 
devices, the cost of managing mobile devices can 
increase, and protecting corporate data and net-
works becomes more difficult. Research conducted 
by the Aberdeen Group found that on average, an 
enterprise with 1,000 mobile devices spends an extra 
$170,000 per year when it allows BYOD. So it’s not 
that simple.
BYOD requires a significant portion of corporate 
IT resources dedicated to managing and maintain-
ing a large number of devices within the organiza-
tion. In the past, companies tried to limit business 
smartphone use to a single platform. This made it 
easier to keep track of each mobile device and to roll 
out software upgrades or fixes, because all employ-
ees were using the same devices, or at the very 
least, the same operating system. The most popular 
employer-issued smartphone used to be Research in 
Motion’s BlackBerry, because it was considered the 
“most secure” mobile platform available. (BlackBerry 
mobile devices access corporate e-mail and data 
using a proprietary software and networking 
 platform that is company-controlled and protected 
from outsiders.) 
Today, the mobile digital landscape is much 
more complicated, with a variety of devices and 
operating systems on the market that do not have 
well-developed tools for administration and secu-
rity. Android has over 79 percent of the worldwide 
smartphone market, but it is more difficult to use 
for corporate work than Apple mobile devices using 
the iOS  operating system. IOS is considered a closed 
system and runs only on a limited number of dif-
ferent Apple mobile devices. In contrast, Android’s 
fragmentation makes it more difficult and costly 
for corporate IT to manage. As of July 2013, there 
were at least 11,868 different Android-based devices 
were available from more than 1,700 different 
brands, according to a report by OpenSignal, which 
researches wireless networks and devices. Android’s 
huge consumer market share attracts many hackers. 
Android is also  vulnerable because it has an open-
source architectureand comes in multiple versions.
If employees are allowed to work with more than 
one type of mobile device and operating system, 
companies need an effective way to keep track of 
all the devices employees are using. To access com-
pany information, the company’s networks must be 
configured to receive connections from that device. 
When employees make changes to their personal 
phone, such as switching cellular carriers, changing 
their phone number, or buying a new mobile device 
altogether, companies will need to quickly and flex-
ibly ensure that their employees are still able to 
remain productive. Firms need an efficient inven-
tory management system that keeps track of which 
devices employees are using, where the device is 
located, whether it is being used, and what software 
it is equipped with. For unprepared companies, 
 keeping track of who gets access to what data could 
be a nightmare.
With the large variety of phones and operating 
systems available, providing adequate technical 
 support for every employee could be difficult. When 
employees are not able to access critical data or 
encounter other problems with their mobile devices, 
they will need assistance from the information 
 systems department. Companies that rely on desktop 
computers tend to have many of the same computers 
 
Chapter 5 IT Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies 
241

with the same specs and operating systems, making 
tech support that much easier. Mobility introduces a 
new layer of variety and complexity to tech support 
that companies need to be prepared to handle.
There are significant concerns with securing 
company information accessed with mobile devices. 
If a device is stolen or compromised, companies 
need ways to ensure that sensitive or confidential 
information isn’t freely available to anyone. Mobility 
puts assets and data at greater risk than if they were 
only located within company walls and on company 
machines. Companies often use technologies that 
allow them to wipe data from devices remotely, or 
encrypt data so that if it is stolen, it cannot be used. 
You’ll find a detailed discussion of mobile security 
issues in Chapter 8.
IBM’s CIO Jeanette Horan believes that BYOD 
may cause as many problems as it solves. BYOD was 
not saving IBM any money and had actually  created 
new challenges for the IT department because 
employees’ devices are full of software that IBM 
doesn’t control. IBM provides secure BlackBerrys 
for about 40,000 of its 400,000 workers while 
 allowing 80,000 more employees to use their own 
 smartphones or tablets to access IBM networks. 
The IBM IT department found it had no grasp of 
which apps and services employees were using on 
their personal devices, and employees themselves 
were “blissfully unaware” of the security risks posed 
by popular apps. IBM decided to ban the use of 
such popular services as the Dropbox cloud-based 
cyberlocker, fearing that employees would put IBM-
sensitive information in their personal Dropbox 
accounts, forward internal email to public Web mail 
services, or use their smartphones as mobile Wi-Fi 
hotspots. According to research by the International 
Data Company (IDC), 20 percent of corporate 
employees using personal cloud storage services 
admitted to using them to store enterprise data, so 
this is becoming a serious problem.
IBM will not allow an employee to access its 
corporate networks with his or her personal device 
unless it secures the device. The IT department 
 configures the device so that its memory can 
be erased remotely if it is lost or stolen. The IT 
group also disables public file-transfer programs 
like Apple’s iCloud; instead, employees use an 
 IBM-hosted version called MyMobileHub. IBM even 
turns off Siri, the voice-activated personal assistant, 
on employees’ iPhones because the spoken queries 
are uploaded to Apple servers.
Each employee’s device is treated differently, 
depending on the model and the job responsibilities 
of the person using it. Some people are only allowed 
to receive IBM e-mail, calendars, and contacts on 
their portable devices, while others can access 
 internal IBM applications and files (see Chapter 8). 
IBM equips the mobile devices of the latter  category 
of employees with additional software, such as 
 programs that encrypt information as it travels to 
and from corporate networks. 
One company that has successfully implemented 
BYOD is Intel Corporation, the giant semiconductor 
company. About 70 percent of the 39,000 devices 
registered on its network are personal devices. Intel 
approached in BYOD in a positive manner, trying 
to find ways to make it work rather than to defeat 
it. Diane Bryant, then Intel’s CIO, didn’t want to be 
dependent on a single mobile vendor or device.
Intel hammered out a BYOD strategy and  created 
an end-user service-level agreement that clarified 
that end users were voluntarily using BYOD rather 
than being mandated by Intel. The company devel-
oped different policies, rules, and access limits 
for each type of device-smartphone, tablet, or lap-
top—with multiple levels of controls in place. Intel 
maintains a list of approved devices. If a device 
does not meet its requirements, it is blocked from 
the network. Intel’s BYOD program today offers 40 
proprietary applications, including travel tools to 
help schedule a flight and conference room finders. 
The company has an internal “app store” and uses 
a  variety of software and security tools, including 
mobile device management (MDM) software and 
mobile app management (MAM) software. 
Intel’s goal for BYOD is not to save money but 
to make employees happier and more produc-
tive. Employees like being able to use their own 
device and apps alongside specialized Intel apps. 
On average, Intel workers report that bringing 
their own devices saves them about 57 minutes per 
day, which amounts to 5 million hours annually 
company-wide. 
Canadian Tire decided not to allow BYOD at all 
and issued new BlackBarry Q10 and Z10 smart-
phones to its 3,000 corporate employees. (Canadian 
Tire is one of Canada’s largest companies, with an 
online e-commerce store and 1,200 retail outlets sell-
ing automotive, sports, leisure, home products, and 
apparel; petroleum outlets; and financial services.) 
The company felt that for its purposes, the bring-
your-own-device model was not sufficiently secure. 
Canadian Tire’s chief technology officer (CTO) 
Eugene Roman worries that an email could sent 
a virus into the company’s core infrastructure. At 
 present, Canadian Tire’s management thinks BYOD 
242 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

is interesting but is not yet ready for the company’s 
mainstream business applications.
In order to successfully deploy mobile devices, 
companies need to carefully examine their business 
processes and determine whether or not mobility 
makes sense for them. Not every firm will benefit 
from mobility to the same degree. Without a clear 
idea of how exactly mobile devices fit into the long 
term plans for the firm, companies will end up 
wasting their money on unnecessary devices and 
programs.

AE Systems (BAE) is the United Kingdom’s (UK) largest manufacturing 
company and one of the largest commercial aerospace and defence 
organizations in Europe. Its high-technology, information-driven prod-
ucts and services range from one of the world’s most capable multi-role 
combat fighters, the Eurofighter Typhoon, to the Jetstream family of commer-
cial aircraft, to the provision of information technology (IT) and information 
systems (IS) for e-business to develop and implement logistics, IT, and e-capabil-
ity services. With sales, manufacturing, and support sites throughout the world, 
including the UK, Europe, the United States, and Australia, BAE employs 88,000 
people and generates more than US$30 billion in annual revenue.
Although BAE has consolidated its competitive position in established mar-
kets, and continues to expand into new markets in the Middle East and Asia, its 
performance in the aircraft part of the business was being impeded by legacy 
information systems that support the computer-aided design (CAD) and com-
puter-aided manufacturing (CAM) of its aircraft. The distributed nature of BAE’s 
design and manufacturing sites meant that storing and analyzing accurate sets 
of operational data describing the complex components of the various aircraft 
types to produce aircraft assembly reports for the production lines became 
increasingly challenging and resource-consuming. Data describing the same air-
craft component parts might need resolution as in the case of various part-nam-
ing conventions and codes.
Accessing the data from the many systems was a complex task involving 
many technical challenges. As the aircraft business of BAE grew, so did the like-
lihood of delays in producing the aircraft assembly reports and other operations 
BAE SYSTEMS

data sets necessary for aircraft production management decision-making. In the 
worst case, the production of aircraft on the assembly line would stop until accu-
rate information was available, with consequent schedule and cost implications. 
BAE’s CAD/CAM staff were storing and analyzing data sets sourced from five 
major aircraft design and manufacturing sites spread throughout the UK, each 
host to thousands of staff involved in the design and manufacturing process, so 
that assembly reports and other operations data could be produced.  Although the 
data that the legacy systems processed were held principally in computer files, 
there were numerous occasions when paper drawings with annotations contain-
ing component design and manufacturing information were used to reconcile 
ambiguities and inconsistencies in the assembly reports. When these data ambi-
guities and inconsistencies occurred, they gave rise to a sense of uncertainty in 
the assembly reports produced. 
What BAE needed was a single repository for CAD/CAM data that would also 
facilitate the integration of data held in its legacy systems. The company decided 
to replace its legacy systems with an enterprise-wide knowledge management 
system that would bring the design and manufacturing data into a single database 
that could be concurrently accessed by the design and manufacturing engineers. 
BAE implemented Siemens’ Teamcenter product lifecycle management software 
and Dassault Systemes’ CATIA CAD/CAM software. Teamcenter can also be con-
figured to take advantage of recent developments in cloud computing using 
Microsoft’s Azure, IBM’s SmartCloud Enterprise+, and Amazon Web Services.
Bringing together Siemens’ Teamcenter and Dassault Systemes’ CATIA has 
given BAE Systems powerful integrated data management tools. The Teamcenter 
database includes tools for component markup and rollup capabilities, allowing 
users to visualize the effect of component design changes and configuration 
selections in real-time. 
The new solution has produced significant cost savings at BAE in terms of its 
design and manufacturing data management and storage while boosting perfor-
mance. With fewer legacy systems and data files to manage, BAE has been able to 
meet quality, time, and cost requirements by being able to produce complete and 
accurate aircraft component definitions and configurations. BAE’s new design 
and manufacturing database technology has improved speed-to-market by syn-
chronizing upstream CAD and downstream CAM component definitions, thereby 
enabling better cross-discipline coordination. With these savings, the company 
has been able to spend more resources on improving data management across 
the entire enterprise.

T
he experience of BAE Systems illustrates the importance of data man-
agement. Business performance depends on the accuracy and reliability 
of its data. The company has grown its business, but, both operational CAD/
CAM efficiency and production management decision making were impeded 
by data stored in legacy systems that were difficult to access. How businesses 
store, organize, and manage their data has a huge impact on organizational 
effectiveness.
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter. BAE Systems management decided that the firm 
needed to improve the management of its data. Pieces of data about design 
248 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

components, manufactured components, and their final assembly had been 
stored in many large legacy systems that made it extremely difficult for the data 
to be retrieved and correctly unified so that it could be used in the production 
line assembly of aircraft components. The data were often redundant and 
inconsistent, limiting their usefulness. Management was unable to obtain an 
enterprise-view of the company.
In the past, BAE Systems had used manual paper processes to reconcile its 
inconsistent and redundant data and to assemble data for management report-
ing. This solution was extremely time-consuming and costly, and prevented the 
company’s information technology department from performing higher-value 
work. A more appropriate solution was to install new hardware and software to 
create an enterprise-wide repository for business information that would sup-
port a more streamlined set of business applications. The new software included 
enterprise software that was integrated with an up-to-date database manage-
ment system that could supply data for enterprise-wide reporting. The com-
pany had to reorganize its data into a standard company-wide format, eliminate 
redundancies, and establish rules, responsibilities, and procedures for updating 
and using the data.
A state-of-the-art database management system suite of software helps BAE 
Systems boost efficiency by making it easier to locate and assemble data for 
management reporting and for processing day-to-day CAD/CAM transactions 
for final aircraft component assembly. The data are more accurate and reliable, 
and costs for managing and storing the data have been considerably reduced.
Here are some questions to think about: What kinds of data management 
problems did BAE Systems experience in its legacy database environment? 
What work had to be done before the company could effectively take advantage 
of the new data management technology?

6.1 
WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS OF MANAGING DATA 
RESOURCES IN A TRADITIONAL FILE 
ENVIRONMENT?
A
n effective information system provides users with accurate, timely, 
and relevant information. Accurate information is free of errors. 
Information is timely when it is available to decision makers when it 
is needed. Information is relevant when it is useful and appropriate 
for the types of work and decisions that require it.
You might be surprised to learn that many businesses don’t have timely, 
accurate, or relevant information because the data in their information systems 
have been poorly organized and maintained. That’s why data management is 
so essential. To understand the problem, let’s look at how information systems 
arrange data in computer files and traditional methods of file management.
FILE ORGANIZATION TERMS AND CONCEPTS
A computer system organizes data in a hierarchy that starts with bits and 
bytes and progresses to fields, records, files, and databases (see Figure 6.1). 
A bit represents the smallest unit of data a computer can handle. A group 
of bits, called a byte, represents a single character, which can be a letter, a 
number, or another symbol. A grouping of characters into a word, a group 
of words, or a complete number (such as a person’s name or age) is called a 
field. A group of related fields, such as the student’s name, the course taken, 
the date, and the grade, comprises a record; a group of records of the same 
type is called a file.
For example, the records in Figure 6.1 could constitute a student course file. 
A group of related files makes up a database. The student course file illustrated 
in Figure 6.1 could be grouped with files on students’ personal histories and 
financial backgrounds to create a student database.
A record describes an entity. An entity is a person, place, thing, or event on 
which we store and maintain information. Each characteristic or quality describ-
ing a particular entity is called an attribute. For example, Student_ID, Course, 
Date, and Grade are attributes of the entity COURSE. The specific values that 
these attributes can have are found in the fields of the record describing the 
entity COURSE.
PROBLEMS WITH THE TRADITIONAL FILE 
ENVIRONMENT
In most organizations, systems tended to grow independently without a 
 company-wide plan. Accounting, finance, manufacturing, human resources, 
and sales and marketing all developed their own systems and data files. 
Figure 6.2 illustrates the traditional approach to information processing.
Each application, of course, required its own files and its own computer 
 program to operate. For example, the human resources functional area might 
have a personnel master file, a payroll file, a medical insurance file, a  pension 
file, a mailing list file, and so forth until tens, perhaps hundreds, of files and 
programs existed. In the company as a whole, this process led to multiple 
master files created, maintained, and operated by separate divisions or depart-
ments. As this process goes on for 5 or 10 years, the organization is saddled 
with hundreds of programs and applications that are very difficult to maintain 
250 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

and manage. The resulting problems are data redundancy and inconsistency, 
program-data dependence, inflexibility, poor data security, and an inability to 
share data among applications.
Data Redundancy and Inconsistency
Data redundancy is the presence of duplicate data in multiple data files so 
that the same data are stored in more than one place or location. Data redun-
dancy occurs when different groups in an organization independently collect 
the same piece of data and store it independently of each other. Data redun-
dancy wastes storage resources and also leads to data inconsistency, where 
the same attribute may have different values. For example, in instances of 
the entity COURSE illustrated in Figure 6.1, the Date may be updated in 
some systems but not in others. The same attribute, Student_ID, may also 
have different names in different systems throughout the organization. Some 
systems might use Student_ID and others might use ID, for example.
Additional confusion might result from using different coding systems 
to represent values for an attribute. For instance, the sales, inventory, and 
 FIGURE 6.1 
THE DATA HIERARCHY
A computer system organizes data in a hierarchy that starts with the bit, which represents either a 0 
or a 1. Bits can be grouped to form a byte to represent one character, number, or symbol. Bytes can be 
grouped to form a field, and related fields can be grouped to form a record. Related records can be 
collected to form a file, and related files can be organized into a database.
 
Chapter 6 Foundations of Business Intelligence: Databases and Information Management 
251

 manufacturing systems of a clothing retailer might use different codes to 
 represent clothing size. One system might represent clothing size as “extra 
large,” whereas another might use the code “XL” for the same purpose. The 
resulting confusion would make it difficult for companies to create customer 
relationship management, supply chain management, or enterprise systems 
that integrate data from different sources.
Program-Data Dependence
Program-data dependence refers to the coupling of data stored in files and the 
specific programs required to update and maintain those files such that changes 
in programs require changes to the data. Every traditional computer program 
has to describe the location and nature of the data with which it works. In a 
traditional file environment, any change in a software program could require a 
change in the data accessed by that program. One program might be modified 
from a five-digit to a nine-digit zip code. If the original data file were changed 
from five-digit to nine-digit zip codes, then other programs that required the 
five-digit zip code would no longer work properly. Such changes could cost 
 millions of dollars to implement properly.
Lack of Flexibility
A traditional file system can deliver routine scheduled reports after extensive 
programming efforts, but it cannot deliver ad hoc reports or respond to unantic-
ipated information requirements in a timely fashion. The information required 
by ad hoc requests is somewhere in the system but may be too expensive to 
 FIGURE 6.2 
TRADITIONAL FILE PROCESSING
The use of a traditional approach to file processing encourages each functional area in a corporation 
to develop specialized applications. Each application requires a unique data file that is likely to be a 
subset of the master file. These subsets of the master file lead to data redundancy and inconsistency, 
processing inflexibility, and wasted storage resources.
252 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

retrieve. Several programmers might have to work for weeks to put together the 
required data items in a new file.
Poor Security
Because there is little control or management of data, access to and dissemina-
tion of information may be out of control. Management may have no way of 
knowing who is accessing or even making changes to the organization’s data.
Lack of Data Sharing and Availability
Because pieces of information in different files and different parts of the 
 organization cannot be related to one another, it is virtually impossible for 
 information to be shared or accessed in a timely manner. Information cannot 
flow freely across different functional areas or different parts of the organi-
zation. If users find different values of the same piece of information in two 
 different systems, they may not want to use these systems because they cannot 
trust the accuracy of their data.
6.2 
WHAT ARE THE MAJOR CAPABILITIES OF 
DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (DBMS) AND 
WHY IS A RELATIONAL DBMS SO POWERFUL?
Database technology cuts through many of the problems of traditional file 
organization. A more rigorous definition of a database is a collection of data 
organized to serve many applications efficiently by centralizing the data and 
controlling redundant data. Rather than storing data in separate files for each 
application, data appears to users as being stored in only one location. A single 
database services multiple applications. For example, instead of a corporation 
storing employee data in separate information systems and separate files for 
personnel, payroll, and benefits, the corporation could create a single common 
human resources database.
DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
A database management system (DBMS) is software that permits an 
 organization to centralize data, manage them efficiently, and provide access 
to the stored data by application programs. The DBMS acts as an interface 
between application programs and the physical data files. When the applica-
tion program calls for a data item, such as gross pay, the DBMS finds this item 
in the database and presents it to the application program. Using traditional 
data files, the programmer would have to specify the size and format of each 
data element used in the program and then tell the computer where they 
were located.
The DBMS relieves the programmer or end user from the task of under-
standing where and how the data are actually stored by separating the logical 
and physical views of the data. The logical view presents data as they would be 
perceived by end users or business specialists, whereas the physical view shows 
how data are actually organized and structured on physical storage media.
The database management software makes the physical database  available 
for different logical views required by users. For example, for the human 
resources database illustrated in Figure 6.3, a benefits specialist might require 
a view consisting of the employee’s name, social security number, and health 
 
Chapter 6 Foundations of Business Intelligence: Databases and Information Management 
253

insurance coverage. A payroll department member might need data such as the 
employee’s name, social security number, gross pay, and net pay. The data for 
all these views are stored in a single database, where they can be more easily 
managed by the organization.
How a DBMS Solves the Problems of the Traditional 
File Environment
A DBMS reduces data redundancy and inconsistency by minimizing  isolated files 
in which the same data are repeated. The DBMS may not enable the  organization 
to eliminate data redundancy entirely, but it can help  control redundancy. Even 
if the organization maintains some redundant data, using a DBMS eliminates 
data inconsistency because the DBMS can help the  organization ensure that 
every occurrence of redundant data has the same values. The DBMS uncouples 
programs and data, enabling data to stand on their own. The description of 
the data used by the program does not have to be  specified in detail each time 
a different program is written. Access and availability of information will be 
increased and  program development and maintenance costs reduced because 
users and programmers can perform ad hoc queries of the database for many 
simple applications without having to write complicated programs. The DBMS 
enables the organization to centrally manage data, their use, and  security. Data-
sharing throughout the organization is easier because the data are presented 
to users as being in a single location rather than fragmented in many different 
systems and files.
Relational DBMS
Contemporary DBMS use different database models to keep track of  entities, 
attributes, and relationships. The most popular type of DBMS today for PCs 
as well as for larger computers and mainframes is the relational DBMS. 
Relational databases represent data as two-dimensional tables (called relations). 
Tables may be referred to as files. Each table contains data on an entity and its 
attributes. Microsoft Access is a relational DBMS for desktop systems, whereas 
 FIGURE 6.3 
HUMAN RESOURCES DATABASE WITH MULTIPLE VIEWS
A single human resources database provides many different views of data, depending on the 
 information requirements of the user. Illustrated here are two possible views, one of interest to a 
benefits specialist and one of interest to a member of the company’s payroll department.
254 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

DB2, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server are relational DBMS for large 
mainframes and midrange computers. MySQL is a popular open source DBMS.
Let’s look at how a relational database organizes data about suppliers and 
parts (see Figure 6.4). The database has a separate table for the entity SUPPLIER 
and a table for the entity PART. Each table consists of a grid of columns and 
rows of data. Each individual element of data for each entity is stored as a 
 separate field, and each field represents an attribute for that entity. Fields in 
a  relational database are also called columns. For the entity SUPPLIER, the 
 supplier  identification number, name, street, city, state, and zip code are stored 
as separate fields within the SUPPLIER table and each field represents an 
 attribute for the entity SUPPLIER.
The actual information about a single supplier that resides in a table is called 
a row. Rows are commonly referred to as records, or in very technical terms, as 
tuples. Data for the entity PART have their own separate table.
The field for Supplier_Number in the SUPPLIER table uniquely identifies 
each record so that the record can be retrieved, updated, or sorted. It is called a 
key field. Each table in a relational database has one field that is  designated as 
its primary key. This key field is the unique identifier for all the information 
 FIGURE 6.4 
RELATIONAL DATABASE TABLES
A relational database organizes data in the form of two-dimensional tables. Illustrated here are tables for the entities SUPPLIER and PART 
showing how they represent each entity and its attributes. Supplier_Number is a primary key for the SUPPLIER table and a foreign key for 
the PART table.
 
Chapter 6 Foundations of Business Intelligence: Databases and Information Management 
255

in any row of the table and this primary key cannot be duplicated. Supplier_
Number is the primary key for the SUPPLIER table and Part_Number is the 
primary key for the PART table. Note that Supplier_Number appears in both 
the SUPPLIER and PART tables. In the SUPPLIER table, Supplier_Number is the 
primary key. When the field Supplier_Number appears in the PART table, it is 
called a foreign key and is essentially a lookup field to look up data about the 
supplier of a specific part.
Operations of a Relational DBMS
Relational database tables can be combined easily to deliver data required by 
users, provided that any two tables share a common data element. Suppose we 
wanted to find in this database the names of suppliers who could provide us 
with part number 137 or part number 150. We would need information from 
two tables: the SUPPLIER table and the PART table. Note that these two files 
have a shared data element: Supplier_Number.
In a relational database, three basic operations, as shown in Figure 6.5, are 
used to develop useful sets of data: select, join, and project. The select operation 
creates a subset consisting of all records in the file that meet stated criteria. 
Select creates, in other words, a subset of rows that meet certain criteria. In 
our example, we want to select records (rows) from the PART table where the 
Part_Number equals 137 or 150. The join operation combines relational tables 
to provide the user with more information than is available in individual tables. 
In our example, we want to join the now-shortened PART table (only parts 137 
or 150 will be presented) and the SUPPLIER table into a single new table.
The project operation creates a subset consisting of columns in a table, permit-
ting the user to create new tables that contain only the information required. In 
our example, we want to extract from the new table only the following columns: 
Part_Number, Part_Name, Supplier_Number, and Supplier_Name.
Non-Relational Databases and Databases in the Cloud
For over 30 years, relational database technology has been the gold  standard. 
Cloud computing, unprecedented data volumes, massive workloads for Web 
services, and the need to store new types of data require database alterna-
tives to the traditional relational model of organizing data in the form of tables, 
 columns, and rows. Companies are turning to “NoSQL” non-relational database 
technologies for this purpose. Non-relational database management  systems 
use a more flexible data model and are designed for managing large data sets 
across many distributed machines and for easily scaling up or down. They are 
useful for accelerating simple queries against large volumes of structured and 
unstructured data, including Web, social media, graphics, and other forms of 
data that are difficult to analyze with traditional SQL-based tools.
There are several different kinds of NoSQL databases, each with its own 
technical features and behavior. Oracle NoSQL Database is one example, 
as is Amazon’s SimpleDB, one of the Amazon Web Services that run in the 
cloud. SimpleDB provides a simple Web services interface to create and store 
 multiple data sets, query data easily, and return the results. There is no need 
to  pre-define a formal database structure or change that definition if new 
data are added later. For example, MetLife decided to employ the MongoDB 
open source NoSQL database to quickly integrate disparate data and deliver 
a  consolidated view of the customer. MetLife’s database brings together data 
from more than 70 separate administrative systems, claims systems and other 
data sources, including semi-structured and unstructured data, such as images 
of health records and death certificates. The NoSQLdatabase is able to ingest

 FIGURE 6.5 
THE THREE BASIC OPERATIONS OF A RELATIONAL DBMS
The select, join, and project operations enable data from two different tables to be combined and only selected attributes to be displayed.

structured, semi-structured and unstructured information without requiring 
tedious, expensive and time-consuming database-mapping (Henschen, 2013).
Amazon and other cloud computing vendors provide relational database 
 services as well. Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) offers 
MySQL, SQL Server, or Oracle Database as database engines. Pricing is based 
on usage. Oracle has its own database cloud service using its relational Oracle 
Database and Microsoft SQL Azure Database is a cloud-based relational database 
service based on Microsoft’s SQL Server DBMS. Cloud-based data management 
services have special appeal for Web-focused start-ups or small to medium-sized 
businesses seeking database capabilities at a lower price than in-house database 
products.
In addition to public cloud-based data management services,  companies 
now have the option of using databases in private clouds. For example, 
Sabre Holdings, the world’s largest software as a service (SaaS) provider 
for the aviation industry, has a  private database cloud that supports more 
than 100 projects and 700 users. A consolidated database spanning a pool of 
 standardized servers  running Oracle Database provides database  services 
for multiple applications. 
CAPABILITIES OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
A DBMS includes capabilities and tools for organizing, managing, and accessing 
the data in the database. The most important are its data definition language, 
data dictionary, and data manipulation language.
DBMS have a data definition capability to specify the structure of the 
 content of the database. It would be used to create database tables and to 
define the  characteristics of the fields in each table. This information about 
the database would be documented in a data dictionary. A data dictionary is 
an automated or manual file that stores definitions of data elements and their 
characteristics.
Microsoft Access has a rudimentary data dictionary capability that displays 
information about the name, description, size, type, format, and other  properties 
of each field in a table (see Figure 6.6). Data dictionaries for large corporate 
databases may capture additional information, such as usage, ownership (who 
in the organization is responsible for maintaining the data), authorization, 
 security, and the individuals, business functions, programs, and reports that 
use each data element.
Querying and Reporting
DBMS includes tools for accessing and manipulating information in databases. 
Most DBMS have a specialized language called a data manipulation  language 
that is used to add, change, delete, and retrieve the data in the database. 
This language contains commands that permit end users and programming 
 specialists to extract data from the database to satisfy information requests and 
develop applications. The most prominent data manipulation language today 
is Structured Query Language, or SQL. Figure 6.7 illustrates the SQL query 
that would produce the new resultant table in Figure 6.5. You can find out more 
about how to perform SQL queries in our Learning Tracks for this chapter.
Users of DBMS for large and midrange computers, such as DB2, Oracle, or 
SQL Server, would employ SQL to retrieve information they needed from the 
database. Microsoft Access also uses SQL, but it provides its own set of user-
friendly tools for querying databases and for organizing data from databases 
into more polished reports.
258 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

In Microsoft Access, you will find features that enable users to create  queries 
by identifying the tables and fields they want and the results, and then select-
ing the rows from the database that meet particular criteria. These actions in 
turn are translated into SQL commands. Figure 6.8 illustrates how the same 
query as the SQL query to select parts and suppliers would be  constructed 
using the Microsoft query-building tools.
Microsoft Access and other DBMS include capabilities for report generation 
so that the data of interest can be displayed in a more structured and polished 
format than would be possible just by querying. Crystal Reports is a popular 
report generator for large corporate DBMS, although it can also be used with 
Access. Access also has capabilities for developing desktop system applications. 
These include tools for creating data entry screens, reports, and developing the 
logic for processing transactions.
DESIGNING DATABASES
To create a database, you must understand the relationships among the data, 
the type of data that will be maintained in the database, how the data will be

used, and how the organization will need to change to manage data from a com-
pany-wide perspective. The database requires both a conceptual design and a 
physical design. The conceptual, or logical, design of a database is an abstract 
model of the database from a business perspective, whereas the  physical design 
shows how the database is actually arranged on direct-access storage devices.
Normalization and Entity-Relationship Diagrams
The conceptual database design describes how the data elements in the 
 database are to be grouped. The design process identifies relationships among 
data elements and the most efficient way of grouping data elements together 
to meet business information requirements. The process also  identifies 
 redundant data elements and the groupings of data elements required for 
 specific application programs. Groups of data are organized, refined, and 
streamlined until an overall logical view of the relationships among all the 
data in the database emerges.
To use a relational database model effectively, complex groupings of data 
must be streamlined to minimize redundant data elements and  awkward 
 many-to-many relationships. The process of creating small, stable, yet 
 flexible and adaptive data structures from complex groups of data is called 
 normalization. Figures 6.9 and 6.10 illustrate this process.
In the particular business modeled here, an order can have more than one 
part but each part is provided by only one supplier. If we build a relation called 
ORDER with all the fields included here, we would have to repeat the name 
 FIGURE 6.9 
AN UNNORMALIZED RELATION FOR ORDER
An unnormalized relation contains repeating groups. For example, there can be many parts and suppliers for each order. There is 
only a one-to-one correspondence between Order_Number and Order_Date.

 query-building tools. It shows the tables, fields, and selection criteria used for the query.

and address of the supplier for every part on the order, even though the order 
is for parts from a single supplier. This relationship contains what are called 
repeating data groups because there can be many parts on a single order to 
a given supplier. A more efficient way to arrange the data is to break down 
ORDER into smaller relations, each of which describes a single entity. If we 
go step by step and normalize the relation ORDER, we emerge with the rela-
tions illustrated in Figure 6.10. You can find out more about normalization, 
 entity-relationship  diagramming, and database design in the Learning Tracks 
for this chapter.
Relational database systems try to enforce referential integrity rules to 
ensure that relationships between coupled tables remain consistent. When 
one table has a foreign key that points to another table, you may not add a 
record to the table with the foreign key unless there is a corresponding record 
in the linked table. In the database we examined earlier in this chapter, the 
foreign key Supplier_Number links the PART table to the SUPPLIER table. 
We may not add a new record to the PART table for a part with Supplier_
Number 8266 unless there is a corresponding record in the SUPPLIER table 
for Supplier_Number 8266. We must also delete the corresponding record in 
the PART table if we delete the record in the SUPPLIER table for Supplier_
Number 8266. In other words, we shouldn’t have parts from nonexistent 
suppliers!
Database designers document their data model with an entity-relationship 
diagram, illustrated in Figure 6.11. This diagram illustrates the relationship 
between the entities SUPPLIER, PART, LINE_ITEM, and ORDER. The boxes 
 FIGURE 6.10 NORMALIZED TABLES CREATED FROM ORDER
After normalization, the original relation ORDER has been broken down into four smaller relations. The relation ORDER is left with only two 
attributes and the relation LINE_ITEM has a combined, or concatenated, key consisting of Order_Number and Part_Number.
 FIGURE 6.11 AN ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM
This diagram shows the relationships between the entities SUPPLIER, PART, LINE_ITEM, and ORDER that might be used to model the 
database in Figure 6.10.

 represent entities. The lines connecting the boxes represent relationships. A 
line connecting two entities that ends in two short marks designates a one-to-
one  relationship. A line connecting two entities that ends with a crow’s foot 
topped by a short mark indicates a one-to-many relationship. Figure 6.11 shows 
that one ORDER can contain many LINE_ITEMs. (A PART can be ordered 
many times and appear many times as a line item in a single order.) Each PART 
can have only one SUPPLIER, but many PARTs can be provided by the same 
SUPPLIER.
It can’t be emphasized enough: If the business doesn’t get its data model right, 
the system won’t be able to serve the business well. The company’s  systems 
will not be as effective as they could be because they’ll have to work with data 
that may be inaccurate, incomplete, or difficult to retrieve. Understanding the 
organization’s data and how they should be represented in a database is  perhaps 
the most important lesson you can learn from this course.
For example, Famous Footwear, a shoe store chain with more than 800 
 locations in 49 states, could not achieve its goal of having “the right style of shoe 
in the right store for sale at the right price” because its database was not  properly 
designed for rapidly adjusting store inventory. The company had an Oracle 
relational database running on a midrange computer, but the  database was 
designed primarily for producing standard reports for  management rather than 
for reacting to marketplace changes. Management could not obtain  precise data 
on specific items in inventory in each of its stores. The  company had to work 
around this problem by building a new database where the sales and  inventory 
data could be better organized for analysis and inventory management.
6.3 
WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL TOOLS AND 
TECHNOLOGIES FOR ACCESSING INFORMATION 
FROM DATABASES TO IMPROVE BUSINESS 
PERFORMANCE AND DECISION MAKING?
Businesses use their databases to keep track of basic transactions, such as paying 
suppliers, processing orders, keeping track of customers, and paying employees. 
But they also need databases to provide information that will help the company 
run the business more efficiently, and help managers and employees make 
better decisions. If a company wants to know which product is the most popular 
or who is its most profitable customer, the answer lies in the data.
THE CHALLENGE OF BIG DATA
Most data collected by organizations used to be transaction data that could 
easily fit into rows and columns of relational  database management systems. 
We are now witnessing an explosion of data from Web traffic, e-mail  messages, 
and social media content (tweets, status  messages), as well as machine- 
generated data from sensors (used in smart meters, manufacturing sensors, 
and electrical meters) or from  electronic trading systems. These data may be 
unstructured or semi-structured and thus not  suitable for relational database 
products that organize data in the form of  columns and rows. We now use the 
term big data to describe these  datasets with volumes so huge that they are 
beyond the ability of typical DBMS to  capture, store, and analyze.
Big data doesn’t refer to any specific quantity, but usually refers to data in 
the petabyte and exabyte range—in other words, billions to trillions of records, 
262 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

all from different sources. Big data are produced in much larger quantities and 
much more rapidly than traditional data. For example, a single jet engine is 
capable of generating 10 terabytes of data in just 30 minutes, and there are 
more than 25,000 airline flights each day. Even though “tweets” are limited to 
140 characters each, Twitter generates over 8 terabytes of data daily. According 
to the International Data Center (IDC) technology research firm, data are more 
than doubling every two years, so the amount of data available to organizations 
is skyrocketing. 
Businesses are interested in big data because they can reveal more patterns 
and interesting anomalies than smaller data sets, with the potential to  provide 
new insights into customer behavior, weather patterns, financial market 
 activity, or other phenomena. However, to derive business value from these 
data,  organizations need new technologies and tools capable of managing and 
 analyzing  non-traditional data along with their traditional enterprise data. 
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE INFRASTRUCTURE
Suppose you wanted concise, reliable information about current operations, 
trends, and changes across the entire company. If you worked in a large 
 company, the data you need might have to be pieced together from separate 
systems, such as sales, manufacturing, and accounting, and even from external 
sources, such as demographic or competitor data. Increasingly, you might need 
to use big data. A contemporary infrastructure for business intelligence has 
an array of tools for obtaining useful information from all the different types 
of data used by businesses today, including semi-structured and unstructured 
big data in vast quantities. These capabilities include data warehouses and data 
marts, Hadoop, in-memory computing, and analytical platforms. Some of these 
capabilities are available as cloud services.
Data Warehouses and Data Marts
The traditional tool for analyzing corporate data for the past two decades has 
been the data warehouse. A data warehouse is a database that stores  current 
and historical data of potential interest to decision makers throughout the 
 company. The data originate in many core operational transaction systems, 
such as  systems for sales, customer accounts, and manufacturing, and may 
include data from Web site transactions. The data warehouse extracts  current 
and  historical data from multiple operational systems inside the organization. 
These data are combined with data from external sources and  transformed 
by correcting  inaccurate and incomplete data and restructuring the data 
for  management reporting and analysis before being loaded into the data 
warehouse.
The data warehouse makes the data available for anyone to access as needed, 
but it cannot be altered. A data warehouse system also provides a range of ad hoc 
and standardized query tools, analytical tools, and graphical reporting facilities .
Companies often build enterprise-wide data warehouses, where a central 
data warehouse serves the entire organization, or they create smaller, decen-
tralized warehouses called data marts. A data mart is a subset of a data ware-
house in which a summarized or highly focused portion of the organization’s 
data is placed in a separate database for a specific population of users. For 
example, a company might develop marketing and sales data marts to deal with 
 customer information. Bookseller Barnes & Noble used to maintain a series of 
data  marts—one for point-of-sale data in retail stores, another for college book-
store sales, and a third for online sales.

Hadoop
Relational DBMS and data warehouse products are not well-suited for organiz-
ing and analyzing big data or data that do not easily fit into columns and rows 
used in their data models. For handling unstructured and semi-structured data 
in vast quantities, as well as structured data, organizations are using Hadoop. 
Hadoop is an open source software framework managed by the Apache 
Software Foundation that enables distributed parallel processing of huge 
amounts of data across inexpensive computers. It breaks a big data problem 
down into  sub-problems, distributes them among up to thousands of inexpen-
sive  computer processing nodes, and then combines the result into a smaller 
data set that is easier to analyze. You’ve probably used Hadoop to find the best 
airfare on the Internet, get directions to a restaurant, do a search on Google, or 
connect with a friend on Facebook.
Hadoop consists of several key services: the Hadoop Distributed File System 
(HDFS) for data storage and MapReduce for high-performance parallel data 
processing. HDFS links together the file systems on the numerous nodes in a 
Hadoop cluster to turn them into one big file system. Hadoop’s MapReduce was 
inspired by Google’s MapReduce system for breaking down processing of huge 
datasets and assigning work to the various nodes in a cluster. HBase, Hadoop’s 
non-relational database, provides rapid access to the data stored on HDFS and a 
transactional platform for running high-scale real-time applications. 
Hadoop can process large quantities of any kind of data, including structured 
transactional data, loosely structured data such as Facebook and Twitter feeds, 
complex data such as Web server log files, and unstructured audio and video 
data. Hadoop runs on a cluster of inexpensive servers, and processors can be 
added or removed as needed. Companies use Hadoop for analyzing very large 
volumes of data as well as for a staging area for unstructured and semi-struc-
tured data before they are loaded into a data warehouse. Facebook stores much of 
its data on its massive Hadoop cluster, which holds an estimated 100 petabytes, 
about 10,000 times more information than the Library of Congress. Yahoo uses 
Hadoop to track user behavior so it can modify its home page to fit their  interests. 
Life sciences research firm NextBio uses Hadoop and HBase to process data for 
 pharmaceutical companies conducting genomic research. Top database vendors 
such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Oracle, and Microsoft have their own Hadoop 
software distributions. Other vendors offer tools for moving data into and out of 
Hadoop or for analyzing data within Hadoop.
In-Memory Computing
Another way of facilitating big data analysis is to use in-memory  computing, 
which relies primarily on a computer’s main memory (RAM) for data storage. 
(Conventional DBMS use disk storage systems.) Users access data stored in 
system primary memory, thereby eliminating bottlenecks from retrieving and 
reading data in a traditional, disk-based database and dramatically shortening 
query response times. In-memory processing makes it  possible for very large sets 
of data, amounting to the size of a data mart or small data warehouse, to reside 
entirely in memory. Complex business calculations that used to take hours or 
days are able to be completed within seconds, and this can even be accomplished 
on handheld devices. (See the Interactive Session on Technology.)
The previous chapter describes some of the advances in contemporary 
 computer hardware technology that make in-memory processing possible, such 
as powerful high-speed processors, multicore processing, and falling computer 
memory prices. These technologies help companies optimize the use of memory 
and accelerate processing performance while lowering costs.

DRIVING ARI FLEET MANAGEMENT WITH REAL-TIME ANALYTICS
Automotive Resources International®, better known 
as simply ARI®, is the world’s largest privately-held 
company for vehicle fleet management services. 
ARI is headquartered in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey and 
has 2,500 employees and offices throughout North 
America, Europe, the UK, and Hong Kong. The com-
pany manages more than 1,000,000 vehicles in the 
U.S., Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Europe.
Businesses that need vehicles for shipments 
(trucks, vans, cars, ships, and rail cars) may choose to 
manage their own fleet of vehicles or they may out-
source fleet management to companies such as ARI 
which specialize in these services. ARI manages the 
entire life cycle and operation of a fleet of vehicles for 
its customers, from up-front specification and acquisi-
tion to resale, including financing, maintenance, fuel 
management, and risk management services such 
as driver safety training and accident management. 
ARI also maintains six call centers in North America 
that operate 24/7, 365 days a year to support custom-
ers’ fleet operations by providing assistance regarding 
repairs, breakdowns, accident response, preventive 
maintenance, and other driver needs. These call 
centers handle about 3.5 million calls per year from 
customers, drivers, and suppliers who expect access to 
real-time actionable information. 
Providing this information has become increas-
ingly challenging. Operating a single large commer-
cial vehicle fleet generates high volumes of complex 
data, such as data on fuel consumption, mainte-
nance, licensing, and compliance. A fuel transaction, 
for example, requires data on state taxes paid, fuel 
grade, total sale, amount sold, and time and place of 
purchase. A simple brake job and preventive mainte-
nance checkup generates dozens of records for each 
component that is serviced. Each part and service 
performed on a vehicle is tracked using American 
Trucking Association codes. ARI collects and ana-
lyzes over 14,000 pieces of data per vehicle. Then 
multiply the data by hundreds of fleets, some with 
up to 10,000 vehicles, all operating simultaneously 
throughout the globe, and you’ll have an idea of the 
enormous volume of data ARI needs to manage, both 
for itself and for its customers.
ARI provided its customers with detailed infor-
mation about their fleet operations, but the type of 
information it could deliver was very limited. For 
example, ARI could generate detailed reports on 
line-item expenditures, vehicle purchases, mainte-
nance records, and other operational information 
presented as simple spreadsheets, charts, or graphs, 
but it was not possible to analyze all the data to spot 
trends and make recommendations. ARI was able to 
analyze data customer by customer, but it was not 
able to aggregate data across its entire customer base. 
For instance, if ARI was managing a pharmaceuti-
cal company’s vehicle fleet, its information  systems 
could not benchmark that fleet’s performance 
against others in the industry. That type of  problem 
required too much manual work and time, and 
still didn’t deliver the level of insight management 
thought was possible.
What’s more, in order to create reports, ARI had to 
go through internal subject matter experts in various 
aspects of fleet operations, who were called “report-
ing power users.” Every request for information was 
passed to these power users. A request for a report 
would take 5 days to fill. If the report was unsatisfac-
tory, it would go back to the report writer to make 
changes. ARI’s process for analyzing its data was 
extremely drawn out.
In mid-2011, ARI implemented SAP 
BusinessObjects Explorer to give customers the 
enhanced ability to access data and run their own 
reports. SAP BusinessObjects Explorer is a busi-
ness intelligence tool that enables business users to 
view, sort and analyze business intelligence data. 
Users search through data sources using an iTunes-
like interface. They do not have to create queries to 
search the data and results are shown with a chart 
that indicates the best information match. The 
graphical representation of results changes as the 
user asks further questions of the data.
In early 2012, ARI integrated SAP BusinessObjects 
Explorer with HANA, SAP’s in-memory computing 
platform that is deployable as an on-premise appli-
ance (hardware and software) or in the cloud. HANA 
is optimized for performing real-time analytics and 
handling very high volumes of operational and trans-
actional data in real time. HANA’s in-memory ana-
lytics queries data stored in random access memory 
(RAM) instead of on a hard disk or flash storage.
Things started happening quickly after that. When 
ARI’s controller wanted an impact analysis of the 
company’s top 10 customers, SAP HANA produced 
the result in 3 to 3 ½ seconds. In ARI’s old systems

environment, this task would have been assigned to 
a power user versed in using reporting tools, speci-
fications would have to be drawn up and a program 
designed for that specific query, a process that would 
have taken about 36 hours.
Using HANA, ARI is now able to quickly mine its 
vast data resources and generate predictions based 
on the results. For example, the company can pro-
duce precise figures on what it costs to operate a 
fleet of a certain size over a particular route across 
specific industries during a certain type of weather 
and predict what the impact of changes in any of 
these variables. And it can do so nearly as easily as 
providing customers with a simple history of their 
expenditures on fuel. With such helpful information 
ARI provides more value to its customers.
HANA has also reduced the time required for each 
transaction handled by ARI’s call centers—from the

time a call center staffer takes a call to retrieving and 
delivering the requested information—by 5 percent. 
Since call center staff account for 40 percent of ARI’s 
direct overhead, that time reduction translates into 
major cost savings.
ARI plans to make some of these real-time report-
ing and analytic capabilities available on mobile 
devices, which will enable customers to instantly 
approve a variety of operational procedures, such as 
authorizing maintenance repairs. Customers will also 
be able to use the mobile tools for instant insight into 
their fleet operations, down to a level of detail such as 
a specific vehicle’s tire history.

Leading commercial products for in-memory computing include SAP’s High 
Performance Analytics Appliance (HANA) and Oracle Exalytics. Each provides 
a set of integrated software components, including in-memory database software 
and specialized analytics software, that run on hardware optimized for  in-memory 
computing work. 
Analytic Platforms
Commercial database vendors have developed specialized high-speed  analytic 
platforms using both relational and non-relational technology that are 
 optimized for analyzing large datasets. Analytic platforms such as IBM Netezza 
and Oracle Exadata feature preconfigured hardware-software systems that are 
specifically designed for query processing and analytics. For example, IBM 
Netezza features tightly integrated database, server, and storage components 
that handle complex analytic queries 10 to 100 times faster than traditional 
systems. Analytic platforms also include in-memory systems and NoSQL non-
relational database management systems. Analytic platforms are now available 
as cloud services.

BI users and BI reporting in greater detail.
ANALYTICAL TOOLS: RELATIONSHIPS, PATTERNS, 
TRENDS
Once data have been captured and organized using the business intelligence 
technologies we have just described, they are available for further analysis 
using software for database querying and reporting, multidimensional data 
analysis (OLAP), and data mining. This section will introduce you to these 
tools, with more detail about business intelligence analytics and applications 
in Chapter 12.
Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)
Suppose your company sells four different products—nuts, bolts, washers, and 
screws—in the East, West, and Central regions. If you wanted to ask a fairly 
straightforward question, such as how many washers sold during the past 
 quarter, you could easily find the answer by querying your sales database. 
But what if you wanted to know how many washers sold in each of your sales 
regions and compare actual results with projected sales? 
To obtain the answer, you would need online analytical processing 
(OLAP). OLAP supports multidimensional data analysis, enabling users to 
view the same data in different ways using multiple dimensions. Each aspect 
 
Chapter 6 Foundations of Business Intelligence: Databases and Information Management 
267

of  information—product, pricing, cost, region, or time period—represents a 
different dimension. So, a product manager could use a multidimensional 
data analysis tool to learn how many washers were sold in the East in June, 
how that compares with the previous month and the previous June, and 
how it compares with the sales  forecast. OLAP enables users to obtain online 
answers to ad hoc questions such as these in a fairly rapid amount of time, 
even when the data are stored in very large databases, such as sales figures for 
multiple years.
Figure 6.13 shows a multidimensional model that could be created to  represent 
products, regions, actual sales, and projected sales. A matrix of actual sales can 
be stacked on top of a matrix of projected sales to form a cube with six faces. 
If you rotate the cube 90 degrees one way, the face showing will be product 
versus actual and projected sales. If you rotate the cube 90 degrees again, you 
will see region versus actual and projected sales. If you rotate 180 degrees from 
the  original view, you will see projected sales and product versus region. Cubes 
can be nested within cubes to build complex views of data. A company would use 
either a specialized multidimensional database or a tool that creates multidimen-
sional views of data in relational databases.
Data Mining
Traditional database queries answer such questions as, “How many units of 
product number 403 were shipped in February 2013?” OLAP, or multidimen-
sional analysis, supports much more complex requests for information, such 
as, “Compare sales of product 403 relative to plan by quarter and sales region 
for the past two years.” With OLAP and query-oriented data analysis, users 
need to have a good idea about the information for which they are looking.
Data mining is more discovery-driven. Data mining provides insights into 
corporate data that cannot be obtained with OLAP by finding hidden patterns 
and relationships in large databases and inferring rules from them to predict 
future behavior. The patterns and rules are used to guide decision making 
and  forecast the effect of those decisions. The types of information obtainable 
 FIGURE 6.13 MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATA MODEL
This view shows product versus region. If you rotate the cube 90 degrees, the face that will 
show is product versus actual and projected sales. If you rotate the cube 90 degrees again, you will 
see region versus actual and projected sales. Other views are possible.
268 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

from data mining include associations, sequences, classifications, clusters, and 
forecasts.
• Associations are occurrences linked to a single event. For instance, a study 
of supermarket purchasing patterns might reveal that, when corn chips 
are  purchased, a cola drink is purchased 65 percent of the time, but when 
there is a promotion, cola is purchased 85 percent of the time. This informa-
tion helps managers make better decisions because they have learned the 
 profitability of a promotion.
• In sequences, events are linked over time. We might find, for example, that if 
a house is purchased, a new refrigerator will be purchased within two weeks 
65 percent of the time, and an oven will be bought within one month of the 
home purchase 45 percent of the time.
• Classification recognizes patterns that describe the group to which an 
item belongs by examining existing items that have been classified and 
by  inferring a set of rules. For example, businesses such as credit card or 
 telephone companies worry about the loss of steady customers. Classification 
helps discover the characteristics of customers who are likely to leave and 
can provide a model to help managers predict who those customers are so 
that the managers can devise special campaigns to retain such customers.
• Clustering works in a manner similar to classification when no groups have 
yet been defined. A data mining tool can discover different groupings within 
data, such as finding affinity groups for bank cards or partitioning a database 
into groups of customers based on demographics and types of personal 
investments.
• Although these applications involve predictions, forecasting uses predictions 
in a different way. It uses a series of existing values to forecast what other 
values will be. For example, forecasting might find patterns in data to help 
managers estimate the future value of continuous variables, such as sales 
figures.
These systems perform high-level analyses of patterns or trends, but they 
can also drill down to provide more detail when needed. There are data mining 
 applications for all the functional areas of business, and for government and 
 scientific work. One popular use for data mining is to provide detailed  analyses 
of patterns in customer data for one-to-one marketing campaigns or for 
 identifying profitable customers. 
Entertainment, formerly known as Harrah’s Entertainment, is the  largest 
gaming company in the world. It continually analyzes data about its  customers 
gathered when people play its slot machines or use its casinos and hotels. The 
corporate marketing department uses this information to build a detailed gam-
bling profile, based on a particular customer’s ongoing value to the company. 
For instance, data mining lets Caesars know the favorite gaming  experience 
of a regular customer at one of its riverboat casinos, along with that person’s 
preferences for room accommodations, restaurants, and  entertainment. This 
information guides management decisions about how to cultivate the most 
profitable customers, encourage those customers to spend more, and attract 
more customers with high revenue-generating potential. Business  intelligence 
improved Caesars’s profits so much that it became the centerpiece of the firm’s 
business strategy. 
Text Mining and Web Mining
Unstructured data, most in the form of text files, is believed to account for over 
80 percent of useful organizational information and is one of the major sources of 
 
Chapter 6 Foundations of Business Intelligence: Databases and Information Management 
269

big data that firms want to analyze. E-mail, memos, call center  transcripts, survey 
responses, legal cases, patent descriptions, and service reports are all valuable 
for finding patterns and trends that will help employees make better business 
decisions. Text mining tools are now  available to help businesses analyze these 
data. These tools are able to extract key  elements from unstructured big data sets, 
discover patterns and relationships, and  summarize the information. 
Businesses might turn to text mining to analyze transcripts of calls to 
 customer service centers to identify major service and repair issues or to 
 measure  customer sentiment about their company. Sentiment analysis 
 software is able to mine text comments in an e-mail message, blog, social media 
conversation, or survey form to detect favorable and unfavorable opinions 
about specific subjects. 
For example, the discount broker Charles Schwab uses Attensity Analyze 
 software to analyze hundreds of thousands of its customer interactions each 
month. The software analyzes Schwab’s customer service notes, e-mails, 
survey responses, and online discussions to discover signs of dissatisfaction 
that might cause a customer to stop using the company’s services. Attensity 
is able to  automatically identify the various “voices” customers use to express 
their  feedback (such as a positive, negative, or conditional voice) to pinpoint a 
 person’s intent to buy, intent to leave, or reaction to a specific product or mar-
keting  message. Schwab uses this information to take corrective actions such 
as stepping up direct broker communication with the customer and trying to 
quickly resolve the  problems that are making the customer unhappy. 
The Web is another rich source of unstructured big data for revealing 
 patterns, trends, and insights into customer behavior. The discovery and anal-
ysis of useful patterns and information from the World Wide Web is called 
Web mining. Businesses might turn to Web mining to help them understand 
customer  behavior, evaluate the effectiveness of a particular Web site, or 
quantify the success of a marketing campaign. For instance, marketers use 
the Google Trends and Google Insights for Search services, which track the 
popularity of various words and phrases used in Google search queries, to 
learn what people are interested in and what they are interested in buying.
Web mining looks for patterns in data through content mining, structure 
mining, and usage mining. Web content mining is the process of extracting 
knowledge from the content of Web pages, which may include text, image, 
audio, and video data. Web structure mining examines data related to the struc-
ture of a particular Web site. For example, links pointing to a document indicate 
the popularity of the document, while links coming out of a document indicate 
the richness or perhaps the variety of topics covered in the document. Web 
usage mining examines user interaction data recorded by a Web server when-
ever requests for a Web site’s resources are received. The usage data records the 
user’s behavior when the user browses or makes transactions on the Web site 
and collects the data in a server log. Analyzing such data can help companies 
determine the value of particular customers, cross marketing strategies across 
products, and the effectiveness of promotional campaigns. 
The chapter-ending case describes organizations’ experiences as they use 
the analytical tools and business intelligence technologies we have described to 
grapple with “big data” challenges.
DATABASES AND THE WEB
Have you ever tried to use the Web to place an order or view a product 
 catalog? If so, you were probably using a Web site linked to an internal 
270 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

 corporate  database. Many companies now use the Web to make some of the 
information in their internal databases available to customers and business 
partners.
Suppose, for example, a customer with a Web browser wants to search an 
online retailer’s database for pricing information. Figure 6.14 illustrates how 
that  customer might access the retailer’s internal database over the Web. The 
user accesses the retailer’s Web site over the Internet using Web browser 
 software on his or her client PC. The user’s Web browser software requests 
data from the  organization’s database, using HTML commands to communi-
cate with the Web server.
Because many back-end databases cannot interpret commands written in 
HTML, the Web server passes these requests for data to software that  translates 
HTML commands into SQL so the commands can be processed by the DBMS 
 working with the database. In a client/server environment, the DBMS resides 
on a  dedicated computer called a database server. The DBMS receives the 
SQL requests and provides the required data. Middleware transfers  information 
from the organization’s internal database back to the Web server for delivery in 
the form of a Web page to the user.
Figure 6.14 shows that the middleware working between the Web server and 
the DBMS is an application server running on its own dedicated  computer (see 
Chapter 5). The application server software handles all application operations, 
including transaction processing and data access, between browser-based com-
puters and a company’s back-end business applications or databases. The appli-
cation server takes requests from the Web server, runs the business logic to 
process transactions based on those requests, and provides connectivity to the 
organization’s back-end systems or databases. Alternatively, the software for 
handling these operations could be a custom program or a CGI script. A CGI 
script is a compact program using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) specifi-
cation for processing data on a Web server.
There are a number of advantages to using the Web to access an organiza-
tion’s internal databases. First, Web browser software is much easier to use 
than proprietary query tools. Second, the Web interface requires few or no 
changes to the internal database. It costs much less to add a Web interface in 
front of a legacy system than to redesign and rebuild the system to improve 
user access.
Accessing corporate databases through the Web is creating new  efficiencies, 
opportunities, and business models. ThomasNet.com provides an up-to-date 
online directory of more than 700,000 suppliers of industrial products, such as 
chemicals, metals, plastics, rubber, and automotive equipment. Formerly called

Thomas Register, the company used to send out huge paper catalogs with this 
information. Now it provides this information to users online via its Web site 
and has become a smaller, leaner company.
Other companies have created entirely new businesses based on access to 
large databases through the Web. One is the social networking service 
Facebook, which helps users stay connected with each other and meet new 
people. Facebook features “profiles” with information on more than 1.3 billion 
active users with information about themselves, including interests, friends, 
photos, and groups with which they are affiliated. Facebook  maintains a mas-
sive database to house and manage all of this content. There are also many 
Web-enabled databases in the public sector to help  consumers and citizens 
access helpful information. 
6.4 
WHY ARE INFORMATION POLICY, DATA 
ADMINISTRATION, AND DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
ESSENTIAL FOR MANAGING THE FIRM’S DATA 
RESOURCES?
Setting up a database is only a start. In order to make sure that the data for 
your business remain accurate, reliable, and readily available to those who 
need it, your business will need special policies and procedures for data 
management.
ESTABLISHING AN INFORMATION POLICY
Every business, large and small, needs an information policy. Your firm’s data 
are an important resource, and you don’t want people doing whatever they 
want with them. You need to have rules on how the data are to be organized and 
maintained, and who is allowed to view the data or change them.
An information policy specifies the organization’s rules for sharing, 
 disseminating, acquiring, standardizing, classifying, and inventorying 
 information. Information policy lays out specific procedures and account-
abilities, identifying which users and organizational units can share 
 information, where information can be distributed, and who is responsi-
ble for updating and maintaining the information. For example, a typical 
information policy would specify that only selected members of the payroll 
and human resources department would have the right to change and view 
sensitive employee data, such as an employee’s salary or social security 
number, and that these departments are responsible for making sure that 
such employee data are accurate.
If you are in a small business, the information policy would be  established 
and implemented by the owners or managers. In a large organization, 
 managing and planning for information as a corporate resource often requires 
a formal data administration function. Data administration is responsible for 
the  specific policies and procedures through which data can be managed as an 
organizational resource. These responsibilities include developing  information 
policy, planning for data, overseeing logical database design and data  dictionary 
 development, and monitoring how information systems specialists and  end-user 
groups use data.
You may hear the term data governance used to describe many of these 
activities. Promoted by IBM, data governance deals with the policies and 
272 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

 processes for managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the 
data employed in an enterprise, with special emphasis on promoting  privacy, 
security, data quality, and compliance with government regulations.
A large organization will also have a database design and management 
group within the corporate information systems division that is responsible 
for defining and organizing the structure and content of the database, and 
maintaining the database. In close cooperation with users, the design group 
establishes the physical database, the logical relations among elements, and 
the access rules and security procedures. The functions it performs are called 
database administration.
ENSURING DATA QUALITY
A well-designed database and information policy will go a long way toward 
ensuring that the business has the information it needs. However, additional 
steps must be taken to ensure that the data in organizational databases are 
 accurate and remain reliable.
What would happen if a customer’s telephone number or account balance were 
incorrect? What would be the impact if the database had the wrong price for the 
product you sold or your sales system and inventory system showed  different 
prices for the same product? Data that are inaccurate, untimely, or inconsistent 
with other sources of information lead to incorrect decisions,  product recalls, 
and financial losses. Gartner Inc. reported that more than 25  percent of the 
critical data in large Fortune 1000 companies’ databases is  inaccurate or incom-
plete, including bad product codes and product descriptions, faulty inventory 
descriptions, erroneous financial data, incorrect  supplier  information, and 
incorrect employee data. A Sirius Decisions study on “The Impact of Bad Data 
on Demand Creation” found that 10 to 25 percent of  customer and  prospect 
records contain critical data errors. Correcting these errors at their source  and 
following best practices for promoting data  quality increased the productivity of 
the sales process and generated a 66 percent increase in  revenue.
Some of these data quality problems are caused by redundant and  inconsistent 
data produced by multiple systems feeding a data warehouse. For example, 
the sales ordering system and the inventory management system might both 
 maintain data on the organization’s products. However, the sales ordering 
system might use the term Item Number and the inventory system might call 
the same attribute Product Number. The sales, inventory, or manufacturing sys-
tems of a clothing retailer might use different codes to represent values for an 
attribute. One system might represent clothing size as “extra large,” whereas 
the other system might use the code “XL” for the same purpose. During the 
design process for the warehouse database, data describing entities, such as a 
customer, product, or order, should be named and defined consistently for all 
business areas using the database.
Think of all the times you’ve received several pieces of the same direct mail 
advertising on the same day. This is very likely the result of having your name 
maintained multiple times in a database. Your name may have been misspelled 
or you used your middle initial on one occasion and not on another or the 
information was initially entered onto a paper form and not scanned properly 
into the system. Because of these inconsistencies, the database would treat 
you as different people! We often receive redundant mail addressed to Laudon, 
Lavdon, Lauden, or Landon.
If a database is properly designed and enterprise-wide data standards 
 established, duplicate or inconsistent data elements should be minimal. 
 
Chapter 6 Foundations of Business Intelligence: Databases and Information Management 
273

Most data quality problems, however, such as misspelled names, transposed 
 numbers, or incorrect or missing codes, stem from errors during data input. 
The incidence of such errors is rising as companies move their businesses to 
the Web and allow customers and suppliers to enter data into their Web sites 
that directly update internal systems.
Before a new database is in place, organizations need to identify and  correct 
their faulty data and establish better routines for editing data once their  database 
is in operation. Analysis of data quality often begins with a data quality audit, 
which is a structured survey of the accuracy and level of completeness of the 
data in an information system. Data quality audits can be performed by survey-
ing entire data files, surveying samples from data files, or surveying end users 
for their perceptions of data quality.
Data cleansing, also known as data scrubbing, consists of activities for 
detecting and correcting data in a database that are incorrect, incomplete, 
improperly formatted, or redundant. Data cleansing not only corrects errors 
but also enforces consistency among different sets of data that originated in 
separate information systems. Specialized data-cleansing software is available 
to automatically survey data files, correct errors in the data, and integrate the 
data in a consistent company-wide format.
Data quality problems are not just business problems. They also pose 
 serious problems for individuals, affecting their financial condition and even 
their jobs. For example, inaccurate or outdated data about consumers’ credit 
 histories maintained by credit bureaus can prevent creditworthy individuals 
from  obtaining loans or lower their chances of finding or keeping a job.

AMERICAN WATER KEEPS DATA FLOWING
American Water, founded in 1886, is the largest pub-
lic water utility in the United States. Headquartered 
in Voorhees, N.J., the company employs more than 
7,000 dedicated professionals who provide drink-
ing water, wastewater and other related services to 
approximately 16 million people in 35 states, as well 
as Ontario and Manitoba, Canada. Most of American 
Water’s services support locally-managed utility sub-
sidiaries that are regulated by the U.S. state in which 
each operates as well as the federal government. 
American Water also owns subsidiaries that manage 
municipal drinking water and wastewater systems 
under contract and others that supply businesses and 
residential communities with water management 
products and services.
Until recently, American water’s systems and 
business processes were very localized, and many 
of these processes were manual. Over time, this 
 information environment became  increasingly 
 difficult to manage. Many systems were not 
 integrated, so that running any type of report that 
had to provide information about more than one 
region was a  heavily manual process. Data had to be 
extracted from the systems supporting each region 
and then combined manually to create the desired 
output. When the company was preparing to hold an 
initial public offering of its stock in 2006, its software 
systems could not handle the required regulatory 
controls, so roughly 80 percent of this work had to be 
performed manually. It was close to a nightmare.
Management wanted to change the company 
from a decentralized group of independent regional 
businesses into a more centralized organization 
with standard company-wide business processes 
and enterprise-wide reporting. The first step toward 
achieving this goal was to implement an enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) system designed to replace 
disparate systems with a single integrated software 
platform. The company selected SAP as its ERP 
 system vendor.
An important step of this project was to migrate 
the data from American Water’s old systems to the 
new platform. The company’s data resided in many 
different systems in various formats. Each regional 
business maintained some of its own data in its own 
systems, and a portion of these data were redundant 
and inconsistent. For example, there were duplicate 
pieces of materials master data because a material 
might be called one thing in the company’s Missouri 
operation and another in its New Jersey business. 
These names had to be standardized so that the same 
name for a piece of data was used by every business 
unit. American Water’s business users had to buy 
into this new company-wide view of data.
Data migration entails much more than just 
 transferring data between old and new systems. 
Business users need to know that data are not just 
a responsibility of the information systems depart-
ment: the business “owns” the data. It is business 
needs that determine the rules and standards for 
managing the data. Therefore, it is up to business 
users to inventory and review all the pieces of data 
in their systems to determine precisely which pieces 
of data from the old system will be used in the new 
system and which data do not need to be brought 
over. The data also need to be reviewed to make sure 
they are accurate and consistent and that redundant 
data are eliminated. 
Most likely some type of data cleansing will be 
required. For example, American Water had data on 
more than 70,000 vendors in its vendor master data 
file. Andrew Clarkson, American Water’s Business 
Intelligence Lead, asked business users to define an 
active vendor and to use that definition to identify 
which data to migrate. He also worked with  various 
functional groups to standardize how to present 
address data. 
One of the objectives of American Water’s data 
management work was to support an enterprise-
wide business intelligence program based on a single 
view of the business. An analytical system and data 
 warehouse would be able to combine data from 
the SAP ERP System with data from other sources, 
including new customer information and enter-
prise asset management systems. That meant that 
American Water’s business users had to do a lot of 
thinking about the kinds of reports they wanted. The 
company had originally planned to have the system 
 provide 200 reports, but later reduced that number 
by half. Business users were trained to  generate 
these reports and customize them. Most financial 
users initially tried to create their reports using 
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software. Over time, 
however, they learned to do the same thing using 
SAP Business Objects Web Intelligence tools that 
came with the system. SAP Business Objects Web

Review Summary
1. What are the problems of managing data resources in a traditional file environment?
Traditional file management techniques make it difficult for organizations to keep track of all of 
the pieces of data they use in a systematic way and to organize these data so that they can be easily 
accessed. Different functional areas and groups were allowed to develop their own files indepen-
dently. Over time, this traditional file management environment creates problems such as data 
redundancy and inconsistency, program-data dependence, inflexibility, poor security, and lack of 
data sharing and availability. A database management system (DBMS) solves these problems with 
software that permits centralization of data and data management so that businesses have a single 
consistent source for all their data needs. Using a DBMS minimizes redundant and inconsistent 
files.
2. What are the major capabilities of DBMS and why is a relational DBMS so powerful?
The principal capabilities of a DBMS includes a data definition capability, a data dictionary capabil-
ity, and a data manipulation language. The data definition capability specifies the structure and 
 content of the database. The data dictionary is an automated or manual file that stores information 
about the data in the database, including names, definitions, formats, and descriptions of data  elements. 
The data manipulation language, such as SQL, is a specialized language for accessing and manipulat-
ing the data in the database.
The relational database has been the primary method for organizing and maintaining data in 
 information systems because it is so flexible and accessible. It organizes data in two-dimensional tables 
called relations with rows and columns. Each table contains data about an entity and its attributes. 
Each row represents a record and each column represents an attribute or field. Each table also  contains 
a key field to uniquely identify each record for retrieval or manipulation. Relational database tables 
can be combined easily to deliver data required by users, provided that any two tables share a common 
276 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

data element. Non-relational databases are becoming popular for managing types of data that can't be  handled 
easily by the relational data model. Both relational and non-relational database products are available as 
cloud computing services.
Designing a database requires both a logical design and a physical design. The logical design  models the 
database from a business perspective. The organization’s data model should reflect its key business 
 processes and decision-making requirements. The process of creating small, stable, flexible, and adaptive 
data structures from complex groups of data when designing a relational  database is termed normalization. 
A well-designed relational database will not have many-to-many relationships, and all attributes for a 
 specific entity will only apply to that entity. It will try to enforce referential integrity rules to ensure that 
relationships between coupled tables remain  consistent. An entity-relationship diagram graphically depicts 
the relationship between entities (tables) in a relational database.
3. What are the principal tools and technologies for accessing information from databases to improve business 
performance and decision making?
Contemporary data management technology has an array of tools for obtaining useful information from all 
the different types of data used by businesses today, including semi-structured and unstructured big data in 
vast quantities. These capabilities include data warehouses and data marts, Hadoop,  in-memory computing, 
and analytical platforms. OLAP represents relationships among data as a  multidimensional structure, which 
can be visualized as cubes of data and cubes within cubes of data, enabling more sophisticated data analysis. 
Data mining analyzes large pools of data, including the  contents of data warehouses, to find patterns and 
rules that can be used to predict future behavior and guide decision making. Text mining tools help  businesses 
analyze large unstructured data sets consisting of text. Web mining tools focus on analysis of useful patterns 
and information from the World Wide Web, examining the structure of Web sites and activities of Web site 
users as well as the contents of Web pages. Conventional databases can be linked via middleware to the Web 
or a Web interface to facilitate user access to an organization’s internal data.
4. Why are information policy, data administration, and data quality assurance essential for managing the 
firm’s data resources?
Developing a database environment requires policies and procedures for managing organizational data as 
well as a good data model and database technology. A formal information policy governs the maintenance, 
distribution, and use of information in the organization. In large corporations, a formal data administration 
function is responsible for information policy, as well as for data planning, data dictionary development, and 
monitoring data usage in the firm.
Data that are inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent create serious operational and financial  problems for 
businesses because they may create inaccuracies in product pricing, customer accounts, and inventory data, 
and lead to inaccurate decisions about the actions that should be taken by the firm. Firms must take special 
steps to make sure they have a high level of data quality. These include using enterprise-wide data standards, 
databases designed to minimize inconsistent and redundant data, data quality audits, and data cleansing 
 software.

Iko Instruments Group, a global supplier of measurement, analytical, and monitoring instruments and 
services based in the Netherlands, had a new data warehouse designed to analyze customer activity to 
improve service and marketing. However, the data warehouse was full of inaccurate and redundant data. 
The data in the warehouse came from numerous transaction processing systems in the United States, 
Europe, Asia, and other locations around the world. The team that designed the warehouse had assumed 
that sales groups in all these areas would enter customer names, telephone numbers, and addresses the 
same way. In fact, companies in different countries were using multiple ways of entering quote, billing, 
shipping, contact information and other data. Assess the potential business impact of these data quality 
problems. What decisions have to be made and steps taken to reach a solution?

Your industrial supply company wants to create a data warehouse where management can obtain a single 
corporate-wide view of critical sales  information to identify bestselling products, key customers, and sales 
trends. Your sales and product information are stored in several different systems: a divisional sales 
system running on a Unix server and a corporate sales system running on an IBM mainframe. You would 
like to create a single standard format that consolidates these data from both systems. In MyMISLab, you 
can review the proposed format, along with sample files from the two systems that would supply the data 
for the data warehouse. Then answer the following questions:
• What business problems are created by not having these data in a single  standard format?
• How easy would it be to create a database with a single standard format that could store the data from 
both systems? Identify the problems that would have to be addressed.
• Should the problems be solved by database specialists or general business managers? Explain.
• Who should have the authority to finalize a single company-wide format for this information in the 
data warehouse?

Billund, Denmark, is one of the largest toy 
manufacturers in the world. Lego’s main 
products have been the bricks and figures 
that children have played with for generations. The 
Danish company has experienced sustained growth 
since its founding in 1932, and for most of its history 
its major manufacturing facilities were located in 
Denmark.
In 2003, Lego was facing tough competition from 
imitators and manufacturers of electronic toys. In an 
effort to reduce costs, the group decided to initiate a 
gradual restructuring process that continues today. 
In 2006, the company announced that a large part 
of its production would be outsourced to the elec-
tronics manufacturing service company Flextronics, 
which has plants in Mexico, Hungary, and the Czech 
Republic. The decision to outsource production came 
as a direct consequence of an analysis of Lego’s total 
supply chain. To reduce labor costs, manually inten-
sive processes were outsourced, keeping only the 
highly skilled workers in Billund. Lego’s workforce 
was gradually reduced from 8,300 employees in 2003 
to approximately 4,200 in 2010. Additionally, produc-
tion had to be relocated to places closer to its natural 
markets. As a consequence of all these changes, Lego 
transformed itself from a manufacturing firm to a 
market-oriented company that is capable of reacting 
fast to changing global demand.
Lego’s restructuring process, coupled with double-
digit sales growth in the past few years, has led to 
the company’s expansion abroad and made its work-
force more international. These changes presented 
supply chain and human resources challenges to 
the company. The supply chain had to be reengi-
neered to simplify production without reducing 
quality. Improved logistics planning allowed Lego to 
work more closely with retailers, suppliers, and the 
new outsourcing companies. At the same time, the 
human resources (HR) department needed to play 
a more strategic role inside the company. HR was 
now responsible for implementing effective policies 
aimed at retaining and recruiting the most qualified 
employees from a diversity of cultural backgrounds.
Adapting company operations to these changes 
required a flexible and robust IT infrastructure 
with business intelligence capabilities that could 
help management perform better forecasting and 
planning. As part of the solution, Lego chose to move 
to SAP business suite software. SAP AG, a German 
company that specializes in enterprise software 
solutions, is one of the leading software companies 
in the world. SAP’s software products include a vari-
ety of applications designed to efficiently support 
all of a company’s essential functions and opera-
tions. Lego chose to implement SAP’s Supply Chain 
Management (SCM), Product Lifecycle Management 
(PLM), and Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) 
modules.
The SCM module includes essential features such 
as supply chain monitoring and analysis as well as 
forecasting, planning, and inventory optimization. 
The PLM module enables managers to optimize 
development processes and systems. The ERP mod-
ule includes, among other applications, the Human 
Capital Management (HCM) application for person-
nel administration and development.
SAP’s business suite is based on a flexible three-
tier client-server architecture that can easily be 
adapted to the new service-oriented architecture 
(SOA) available in the latest versions of the software. 
In the first tier, a client interface—a browser-type 
graphical user interface (GUI) running on either a 
laptop, desktop, or mobile device—submits users’ 
requests to the application servers. The applications 
servers (the second tier in the system) receive and 
process clients’ requests. In turn, these application 
servers send the processed requests to the database 
system (the third tier) which consists of one or more 
relational databases. SAP’s business suite supports 
databases from different vendors, including those 
offered by Oracle, Microsoft, MySQL, and others. 
The relational databases contain tables that store 
data on Lego’s products, daily operations, the supply 
chain, and thousands of employees. Managers can 
easily use the SAP query tool to obtain reports from 
the databases because it does not require any techni-
cal skill. Additionally, the distributed architecture 
enables authorized personnel to have direct access 
to the database system from the company’s various 
locations, including those in Europe, North America, 
and Asia.
SAP’s ERP-HCM module includes advanced fea-
tures such as “Talent Manager” as well as those for 
handling employee administration, reporting, and 
travel and time management. These features allow

281

Lego’s HR personnel to select the best candidates, 
schedule their training, and create a stimulus plan 
to retain them. It is also possible to include perfor-
mance measurements and get real-time insight into 
HR trends. Using these advanced features, together 
with tools from other software vendors, Lego’s man-
agers are able to track employees’ leadership poten-
tial, develop their careers, and forecast the recruiting 
of new employees with certain skills.
The investments that The Lego Group has made 
in information systems and business re-design have 
paid off handsomely. In 2013 the Group increased 
sales by 11% to €3,403 million against €3,103 million 
the year before. Operating profit increased 10% to 
€1,118.  Full-time employees increased to 11,755 as 
the company expanded production in Asia.  In the 
first half of 2014, revenue increased 15 percent com-
pared with the same period last year measured, and 
profits increased by 12% when compared to the simi-
lar period in 2013.
Reflecting its growing emphasis on developing a 
global company, and its substantial investment in 
global information systems both in the supply chain 
and the distribution chain, The Lego Group  in 2014 
is showing strong, long-term growth in all regions.  
In Europe, America, and Asia, sales growth has been 
in the double digits for over five years despite the 
fact that the Global Great Recession (2008 to 2013) 
led to flat sales of toys worldwide.  In the Asian 
region, growth in Lego sales varied from market to 
market. China’s growth in consumer sales of more 
than 50% was the most significant in the region. This 
supports The Lego Group’s ambitions to further glo-
balize the company and make Asia a significant con-
tributor to future growth.
During April 2014 The Lego Group opened its 
first factory in China, located in Jiaxing, and a new 
office in Shanghai, which is one of five main offices 
globally for The Lego Group.  The executives of Lego 
believe there is huge potential in Asia, and they are 
moving to be located close to their Asian customers. 
Lego executives believe that there is tremendous 
potential in Asia, and have decided to learn more 
about the Asian market and build capabilities in the 
region. The new factory and office represent a signif-
icant expansion of the Lego physical presence in the 
region. According to executives, in combination with 
their existing office in Singapore, the Shanghai office 
and the new factory enable strategically important 
functions to be located close to their customers as 
well as children and parents in China and Asia. 
The decision to place a Lego factory in China is a 
direct consequence of The Lego Group’s ambition to 
have production placed close to core markets.   This 
same philosophy has led to expansions of the Lego 
factory in the Czech Republic, and an entirely new 
factory was opened in Nyiregyhaza, Hungary, in 
March 2014.  These factories, along with the parent 
factory in Denmark, serve the European markets.  
To serve the Americas faster and with customized 
products, the company expanded its Lego factory in 
Monterrey, Mexico. 
Executives believe the global approach to informa-
tion systems and production facilities enables the 
company to deliver Lego products to retailers and 
ultimately to children all over the world very fast, 
offering a world class service to consumers. In 2014, 
in addition to its growth across a variety of markets, 
The LEGO Movie was also released to overwhelm-
ingly positive reviews, bolstering the company’s 
brand and allowing it to develop a new array of prod-
ucts based on the movie’s themes. 
The Lego Group is primed to continue its growth 
throughout 2015 and beyond using its organizational 
flexibility and the concepts it has honed for years. 
The company is responding to its customers and 
releasing new versions of some of its most popular 
sets of toys, including its Bionicle series of block 
sets.  The company also launched a new office with 
120 employees and an additional 80 more to come 
in 2015, complete with an innovative work environ-
ment without assigned desk spaces and emphasizing 
creativity over rigid routines. Like their expansion 
into Asia, the new office represents an effort to estab-
lish a global presence with offices and employees 
around the world to reach as many potential families 
and children as possible. So far, Lego has built an 
impressive worldwide presence, block by block.

ontinental AG, headquartered in Hanover, Germany, is a global auto 
and truck parts manufacturing company, with 164,000 employees in 
46 countries. It is also the world’s fourth largest tire manufacturer 
and one of the top five automotive suppliers in the world.
One of the factories for Continental’s Tire Division is located in 
Sarreguemines, France. This facility produces 1,000 different kinds of tires 
and encompasses nearly 1.5 million square feet. The production process 
requires large wheeled carts loaded with sheets of  rubber or other compo-
nents to be transported from storage to workstations as tires are being built. 
Until recently, if a carrier was not in its expected location, a worker had to 
look for it manually. Manual tracking was time-consuming and inaccurate, 
and the plant often lost track of tire components altogether.
Missing materials created bottlenecks and production delays at a time 
when business was growing and the company needed to increase produc-
tion capacity. Continental found a solution in a new real-time location sys-
tem based on a Wi-Fi wireless network using radio frequency identification 
(RFID) tags, AeroScout MobileView software, mobile computers, and Global 
Data Sciences’ material inventory tracking system software. 
The Sarreguemines plant mounted AeroScout T2-EB Industrial RFID tags 
on the sides of 1,100 of its carriers. As the carriers move from one 
 manufacturing or storage station to another, location information about the 
cart is  transmitted to nearby nodes of a Cisco Wi-Fi wireless network. 
AeroScout’s MobileView software picks up the location and  represents the 
carrier as an icon on a map of the facility displayed on  computer screens. 
Fifteen Honeywell Dolphin 6500 and Motorola Solutions MC9190  handheld

computers are used to confirm that a carrier has been loaded with  components 
or has arrived at a specific  workstation.
Seven of the plant’s tuggers, which are small trucks for hauling the carri-
ers around the plant, are equipped with DLOG mobile vehicle-mounted com-
puters. When a tugger driver is looking for a specific component, he or she 
can use the mobile device to access the MobileView system, pull up a map of 
the facility, and see an icon indicating where that component’s carrier is 
located. The location tracking system provides a real-time snapshot of all the 
components used in the factory.
A bar code label is attached to each component and carrier, and the system 
starts tracking that component as soon as it is placed in a carrier. Plant work-
ers use one of the Motorola or Honeywell handhelds and the MobileView 
software to scan the bar code labels on both the component and its carrier, 
which is associated with the ID number transmitted by an RFID tag mounted 
on the carrier. The scanned bar code data are stored in a material inventory 
tracking system. The MobileView software tracks the carrier’s location as it 
is being transported to a storage area, and also the location where it is placed 
in storage. 
When components are needed for manufacturing, a tugger driver uses the 
DLOG mobile computer to identify the location of the carrier with those spe-
cific components, and then goes to that location. After the carrier has been 
retrieved and taken to a workstation, its bar code is scanned by an employee 
at that station using one of the handheld computers. This updates the system 
to show that the required components have been received.
By enabling tugger drivers to quickly locate components, the new system 
has increased productivity and ensures that materials are not overlooked or 
misplaced. Fewer materials are thrown away because they expired and were 
not used when they were needed. The system is able to send alerts of 
 materials that have been sitting too long in one spot.
When AeroScout and the new material inventory tracking system were 
implemented in September 2011, Continental made sure all production 
employees, including truckers, tire builders, and management, received 
training in the new system functions. The company also provided workers 
with instruction cards with detailed descriptions of system functions that 
they could use for reference.
Thanks to the new system, the Sarreguemines tire factory has increased 
production from 33,000 to 38,000 tires per day. Wastage of tire components 
has been reduced by 20 percent.

ontinental Tires’s experience illustrates some of the powerful  capabilities 
and opportunities provided by contemporary networking technology. 
The company uses wireless networking, radio frequency identification (RFID) 
technology, mobile computers, and materials inventory management software 
to automate tracking of components as they move through the production 
 process.
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter. Continental Tires’ production environment extends 
over a very large area, and requires intensive oversight and coordination to 
make sure that components are available when and where they are needed in 
the production process. Tracking components manually was very slow and 
cumbersome, increasing the possibility that components would be overlooked 
or lost.

WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND KEY 
NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES? 
I
f you run or work in a business, you can’t do without networks. You need 
to communicate rapidly with your customers, suppliers, and employ-
ees. Until about 1990, businesses used the postal system or  telephone 
 system with voice or fax for communication. Today, however, you and 
your employees use computers, e-mail, text messaging, the Internet, mobile 
phones, and mobile computers connected to wireless networks for this  purpose. 
Networking and the Internet are now nearly synonymous with doing business. 
NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATION TRENDS
Firms in the past used two fundamentally different types of networks: 
 telephone  networks and computer networks. Telephone networks historically 
handled voice  communication, and computer networks handled data traffic. 
Telephone networks were built by  telephone  companies throughout the twenti-
eth  century using voice transmission technologies  (hardware and software), and 
these  companies almost always operated as regulated  monopolies throughout 
Management decided that wireless technology and RFID tagging  provided 
a solution and arranged for the deployment of a wireless RFID network 
throughout the entire Sarreguemines production facility. The  network 
made it much easier to track components and to optimize tugger truck 
 movements. Continental Tires had to redesign its production and other 
work  processes and train employees in the new system to take advantage of 
the new  technology.
Here are some questions to think about: How did Continental’s real-time 
location system transform operations? Why was training so important?

the world. Computer networks were originally built by computer  companies 
 seeking to transmit data between computers in different locations.
Thanks to continuing telecommunications deregulation and informa-
tion  technology innovation, telephone and computer networks are converg-
ing into a single digital  network using shared Internet-based standards and 
equipment. Telecommunications  providers today, such as AT&T and Verizon, 
offer data transmission, Internet access, mobile phone service, and television 
 programming as well as voice service. Cable companies, such as Cablevision 
and Comcast, offer voice  service and Internet access. Computer networks have 
expanded to include Internet  telephone and video services. Increasingly, all of 
these voice, video, and data communications are based on Internet technology.
Both voice and data communication networks have also become more 
 powerful (faster), more portable (smaller and mobile), and less expensive. For 
instance, the typical Internet connection speed in 2000 was 56 kilobits per 
second, but today more than 74 percent of U.S. households have high-speed 
 broadband connections provided by telephone and cable TV companies 
 running at 1 to 15 million bits per second. The cost for this service has fallen 
exponentially, from 25 cents per kilobit in 2000 to a tiny fraction of a cent today. 
Increasingly, voice and data communication, as well as Internet access, are 
 taking place over broadband wireless platforms, such as mobile phones, mobile 
handheld devices, and PCs in wireless networks. More than half the Internet 
users in the United States use smartphones and tablets to access the Internet.
WHAT IS A COMPUTER NETWORK?
If you had to connect the computers for two or more employees together 
in the same office, you would need a computer network. Exactly what is a 
 network? In its simplest form, a  network consists of two or more connected 
computers. Figure 7.1 illustrates the major  hardware, software, and transmis-
sion  components used in a simple network: a  client  computer and a dedicated 
server computer, network interfaces, a connection medium,  network operating 
system software, and either a hub or a switch.
Each computer on the network contains a network interface device to link 
the computer to the network. The connection medium for linking network 
 components can be a telephone wire, coaxial cable, or radio signal in the case of 
cell phone and wireless local area networks (Wi-Fi networks).
The network operating system (NOS) routes and manages communications 
on the network and coordinates network resources. It can reside on every com-
puter in the  network, or it can reside primarily on a dedicated server  computer 
for all the applications on the network. A server computer is a  computer on a 
network that performs important network functions for client computers, such as 
serving up Web pages, storing data, and storing the network operating system (and 
hence controlling the network). Microsoft Windows Server, Linux, and Novell 
Open Enterprise Server are the most widely used network operating systems. 
Most networks also contain a switch or a hub acting as a connection point 
between the computers. Hubs are very simple devices that connect network 
components, sending a packet of data to all other connected devices. A switch 
has more intelligence than a hub and can filter and forward data to a specified 
destination on the network.
What if you want to communicate with another network, such as the 
Internet? You would need a router. A router is a communications processor 
used to route packets of data through different networks, ensuring that the data 
sent gets to the correct address.
290 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

Network switches and routers have proprietary software built into their 
 hardware for directing the movement of data on the network. This can create 
network bottlenecks and makes the process of configuring a network more 
 complicated and time-consuming. Software-defined networking (SDN) 
is a new networking approach in which many of these control functions are 
 managed by one central program, which can run on inexpensive commod-
ity servers that are separate from the network devices themselves. This is 
 especially helpful in a cloud computing environment with many different 
pieces of hardware because it allows a network administrator to manage traffic 
loads in a flexible and more efficient manner.
Networks in L arge Companies
The network we’ve just described might be suitable for a small business. But 
what about large companies with many different locations and thousands 
of employees? As a firm grows, and collects hundreds of small local area 
 networks, these networks can be tied together into a corporate-wide network-
ing infrastructure. The network infrastructure for a large  corporation consists 
of a large number of these small local area networks linked to other local area 
networks and to  firmwide corporate networks. A number of powerful  servers 
support a corporate Web site, a corporate intranet, and perhaps an extranet. 
Some of these servers link to other large computers supporting  back-end 
systems. 
Figure 7.2 provides an illustration of these more complex, larger scale 
 corporate-wide networks. Here you can see that the corporate network 
 infrastructure supports a mobile sales force using mobile phones and 
 smartphones, mobile employees linking to the company Web site, internal 
 FIGURE 7.1 
COMPONENTS OF A SIMPLE COMPUTER NETWORK
Illustrated here is a very simple computer network, consisting of computers, a network operating system (NOS) residing on a dedicated 
server computer, cable (wiring) connecting the devices, switches, and a router.

company networks using mobile wireless local area networks (Wi-Fi  networks), 
and a videoconferencing system to support managers across the world. In 
 addition to these computer  networks, the firm’s infrastructure may include 
a separate telephone  network that handles most voice data. Many firms are 
 dispensing with their  traditional telephone networks and using Internet 
 telephones that run on their existing data networks (described later).
As you can see from this figure, a large corporate network infrastructure uses 
a wide variety of technologies—everything from ordinary telephone  service 
and corporate data networks to Internet service, wireless Internet, and mobile 
phones. One of the major problems facing corporations today is how to  integrate 
all the different communication networks and channels into a coherent system 
that enables information to flow from one part of the  corporation to another, 
and from one system to another. As more and more  communication networks 
become  digital, and based on Internet technologies, it will become easier to 
 integrate them.
KEY DIGITAL NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES
Contemporary digital networks and the Internet are based on three key 
 technologies:  client/server computing, the use of packet switching, and the 
development of widely used  communications standards (the most important 
 FIGURE 7.2

of which is Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP) for 
 linking disparate networks and computers.
Client/Server Computing
Client/server computing, introduced in Chapter 5, is a  distributed comput-
ing model in which some of the processing power is located within small, 
 inexpensive client computers, and resides literally on desktops, laptops, or in 
handheld devices. These powerful clients are linked to one another through 
a network that is controlled by a network server computer. The server sets 
the rules of communication for the network and provides every client with an 
address so others can find it on the network.
Client/server computing has largely replaced centralized mainframe 
 computing in which nearly all of the processing takes place on a central large 
mainframe computer. Client/server computing has extended computing to 
departments, workgroups, factory floors, and other parts of the business that 
could not be served by a centralized architecture. It also makes it possible 
for personal computing devices such as PCs, laptops, and mobile phones, to 
be  connected to networks such as the Internet. The Internet is the largest 
 implementation of client/server computing.
Packet Switching
Packet switching is a method of slicing digital messages into parcels called 
packets,  sending the packets along different communication paths as they 
become available, and then  reassembling the packets once they arrive at their 
destinations (see Figure 7.3). Prior to the development of packet switching, 
computer networks used leased, dedicated  telephone circuits to communicate 
with other computers in remote locations. In circuit-switched  networks, such as 
the telephone system, a complete point-to-point circuit is assembled, and then 
communication can proceed. These dedicated circuit-switching techniques

COMMUNICATIONS
Data are grouped into small packets, which are transmitted independently over various communica-
tions channels and reassembled at their final destination.

were  expensive and wasted available communications capacity—the circuit was 
maintained regardless of whether any data were being sent.
Packet switching makes much more efficient use of the communica-
tions capacity of a network. In packet-switched networks, messages are first 
broken down into small fixed bundles of data called packets. The  packets 
include  information for directing the packet to the right address and for 
 checking  transmission errors along with the data. The packets are transmit-
ted over  various communications channels using routers, each packet traveling 
 independently. Packets of data originating at one source will be routed through 
many different paths and networks before being reassembled into the original 
message when they reach their destinations.
TCP/IP and Connectivity
In a typical telecommunications network, diverse hardware and  software 
 components need to work together to transmit information. Different 
 components in a network communicate with each other only by adhering to 
a common set of rules called protocols. A protocol is a set of rules and proce-
dures governing transmission of information between two points in a  network.
In the past, many diverse proprietary and incompatible protocols often 
forced  business firms to purchase computing and communications equipment 
from a single vendor. But today, corporate networks are increasingly using a 
single, common, worldwide standard called Transmission Control Protocol/
Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). TCP/IP was  developed during the early 1970s 
to support U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
(DARPA) efforts to help scientists transmit data among different types of 
 computers over long distances. 
TCP/IP uses a suite of protocols, the main ones being TCP and IP. TCP refers 
to the Transmission Control Protocol, which handles the movement of data 
between  computers. TCP establishes a connection between the computers, 
sequences the transfer of packets, and acknowledges the packets sent. IP refers 
to the Internet Protocol (IP), which is responsible for the delivery of packets 
and includes the disassembling and reassembling of packets during transmis-
sion. Figure 7.4 illustrates the four-layered Department of Defense reference 
model for TCP/IP, and the layers are described as follows:
 FIGURE 7.4 
THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET 
PROTOCOL (TCP/IP) REFERENCE MODEL
This figure illustrates the four layers of the TCP/IP reference model for communications.
294 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

1. Application layer. The Application layer enables client application programs to 
access the other layers and defines the protocols that applications use to 
exchange data. One of these application protocols is the Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol (HTTP), which is used to transfer Web page files.
2. Transport layer. The Transport layer is responsible for providing the 
Application layer with communication and packet services. This layer includes 
TCP and other protocols. 
3. Internet layer. The Internet layer is responsible for addressing, routing, and 
packaging data packets called IP datagrams. The Internet Protocol is one of the 
protocols used in this layer.
4. Network Interface layer. At the bottom of the reference model, the Network 
Interface layer is responsible for placing packets on and receiving them from 
the network medium, which could be any networking technology.
Two computers using TCP/IP are able to communicate even if they are 
based on different hardware and software platforms. Data sent from one 
computer to the other passes downward through all four layers, starting with 
the sending computer’s Application layer and passing through the Network 
Interface layer. After the data reach the recipient host computer, they travel 
up the layers and are reassembled into a format the receiving computer can 
use. If the receiving computer finds a damaged packet, it asks the  sending 
computer to retransmit it. This process is reversed when the receiving 
 computer responds.
7.2 
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF 
NETWORKS?
Let’s look more closely at alternative networking technologies available to 
 businesses.
SIGNALS: DIGITAL VS. ANALOG
There are two ways to communicate a message in a network: an analog signal 
or a digital signal. An analog signal is represented by a continuous waveform 
that passes through a communications medium and has been used for voice 
 communication. The most common analog devices are the telephone  handset, 
the speaker on your computer, or your iPod earphone, all of which  create analog 
waveforms that your ear can hear.
A digital signal is a discrete, binary waveform, rather than a continuous 
 waveform. Digital signals communicate information as strings of two  discrete 
states: one bit and zero bits, which are represented as on-off electrical pulses. 
Computers use digital signals and require a modem to convert these digital 
 signals into analog  signals that can be sent over (or received from) telephone 
lines, cable lines, or wireless media that use analog signals (see Figure 7.5). 
Modem stands for  modulator-demodulator. Cable modems connect your 
 computer to the Internet using a cable network. DSL modems connect your 
computer to the Internet using a telephone  company’s landline network. 
Wireless modems perform the same function as traditional modems, connect-
ing your computer to a wireless network that could be a cell phone network, 
or a Wi-Fi network. Without modems,  computers could not communicate with 
one another using analog networks (which include the telephone system and 
cable networks).

TYPES OF NETWORKS
There are many different kinds of networks and ways of classifying them. 
One way of  looking at networks is in terms of their geographic scope (see 
Table 7.1).
Local Area Networks
If you work in a business that uses networking, you are probably connecting to 
other employees and groups via a local area network. A local area network 
(LAN) is designed to connect personal computers and other digital devices 
within a half-mile or 500-meter radius. LANs typically connect a few comput-
ers in a small office, all the computers in one building, or all the computers in 
 several buildings in close proximity. LANs also are used to link to long-distance 
wide area networks (WANs, described later in this section) and other networks 
around the world using the Internet. 
Review Figure 7.1, which could serve as a model for a small LAN that might 
be used in an office. One computer is a dedicated network file server,  providing 
users with access to shared computing resources in the network, including 
 software programs and data files. 
The server determines who gets access to what and in which sequence. The 
router  connects the LAN to other networks, which could be the Internet or 
another corporate  network, so that the LAN can exchange information with 
 networks external to it. The most common LAN operating systems are Windows, 
Linux, and Novell. Each of these network operating systems  supports TCP/IP 
as its default networking protocol. 
Ethernet is the dominant LAN standard at the physical network level, 
 specifying the physical medium to carry signals between computers, access 
control rules, and a  standardized set of bits used to carry data over the system.

FUNCTIONS OF THE MODEM
A modem is a device that translates digital signals into analog form (and vice versa) so that computers 
can transmit data over analog networks such as telephone and cable networks.
296 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

Originally, Ethernet supported a data transfer rate of 10 megabits per second 
(Mbps). Newer versions, such as Gigabit Ethernet, support a data transfer rate 
of 1 gigabit per second (Gbps). 
The LAN illustrated in Figure 7.1 uses a client/server architecture where 
the network operating system resides primarily on a single file server, and 
the server provides much of the control and resources for the network. 
Alternatively, LANs may use a peer-to-peer architecture. A peer-to-peer 
 network treats all processors equally and is used primarily in small networks 
with 10 or fewer users. The various computers on the network can exchange 
data by direct access and can share peripheral devices without going through 
a separate server. 
In LANs using the Windows Server family of operating systems, the 
 peer-to-peer  architecture is called the workgroup network model, in which 
a small group of computers can share resources, such as files, folders, and 
printers, over the network without a dedicated server. The Windows domain 
 network model, in contrast, uses a dedicated server to manage the computers 
in the network.
Larger LANs have many clients and multiple servers, with separate  servers 
for  specific services, such as storing and managing files and databases (file 
servers or  database  servers), managing printers (print servers), storing and 
managing e-mail (mail servers), or storing and managing Web pages (Web 
servers).
Metropolitan and Wide Area Networks
Wide area networks (WANs) span broad geographical distances—entire 
regions, states, continents, or the entire globe. The most universal and  powerful 
WAN is the Internet. Computers connect to a WAN through public networks, 
such as the telephone system or private cable systems, or through leased lines 
or satellites. A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a network that spans 
a metropolitan area, usually a city and its major suburbs. Its geographic scope 
falls between a WAN and a LAN.
TRANSMISSION MEDIA AND TRANSMISSION SPEED
Networks use different kinds of physical transmission media, including twisted 
pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, and media for wireless transmission. 
Each has advantages and limitations. A wide range of speeds is possible for any 
given medium depending on the software and hardware configuration. Table 7.2 
 compares these media.
Bandwidth: Transmission Speed
The total amount of digital information that can be transmitted through 
any  telecommunications medium is measured in bits per second (bps). One 
signal change, or cycle, is required to  transmit one or several bits; therefore, 
the transmission capacity of each type of telecommunications medium is a 
function of its frequency. The number of cycles per second that can be sent 
through that medium is measured in hertz—one hertz is equal to one cycle 
of the medium.
The range of frequencies that can be accommodated on a particular telecom-
munications channel is called its bandwidth. The bandwidth is the difference 
between the highest and lowest frequencies that can be accommodated on a 
single channel. The greater the range of frequencies, the greater the bandwidth 
and the greater the channel’s transmission capacity.

HOW DO THE INTERNET AND INTERNET 
TECHNOLOGY WORK AND HOW DO THEY SUPPORT 
COMMUNICATION AND E-BUSINESS?
We all use the Internet, and many of us can’t do without it. It’s become an 
 indispensable personal and business tool. But what exactly is the Internet? How 
does it work, and what does Internet technology have to offer for business? 
Let’s look at the most important Internet features.
WHAT IS THE INTERNET?
The Internet has become the world’s most extensive, public communication 
system. It’s also the world’s largest  implementation of client/server computing 
and internetworking, linking millions of individual  networks all over the world. 
This global network of networks began in the early 1970s as a U.S. Department 
of Defense network to link scientists and university professors around the 
world. 
Most homes and small businesses connect to the Internet by subscribing to 
an Internet service provider. An Internet service provider (ISP) is a com-
mercial organization with a permanent connection to the Internet that sells 
temporary connections to retail subscribers. EarthLink, NetZero, AT&T, and 
Time Warner are ISPs. Individuals also connect to the Internet through their 
business firms, universities, or research centers that have designated Internet 
domains. 
There are a variety of services for ISP Internet connections. Connecting via 
a  traditional  telephone line and modem, at a speed of 56.6 kilobits per second 
(Kbps), used to be the most common form of connection worldwide, but it has 
been largely replaced by broadband  connections. Digital subscriber line, cable, 
satellite Internet connections, and T lines provide these broadband  services.
Digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies operate over existing telephone 
lines to carry voice, data, and video at transmission rates ranging from 385 Kbps

all the way up to 40 Mbps, depending on usage patterns and distance. Cable 
Internet connections provided by cable  television vendors use digital cable 
coaxial lines to deliver high-speed Internet access to homes and businesses. 
They can provide high-speed access to the Internet of up to 50 Mbps, although 
most providers offer service ranging from 1 Mbps to 6 Mbps. In areas where 
DSL and cable services are unavailable, it is possible to access the Internet 
via  satellite, although some satellite Internet connections have slower upload 
speeds than other broadband services. 
T1 and T3 are international telephone standards for digital communica-
tion. They are leased, dedicated lines suitable for businesses or government 
 agencies requiring high-speed guaranteed service levels. T1 lines offer 
 guaranteed  delivery at 1.54 Mbps, and T3 lines offer delivery at 45 Mbps. The 
Internet does not provide similar guaranteed service levels, but simply “best 
effort.”
INTERNET ADDRESSING AND ARCHITECTURE
The Internet is based on the TCP/IP networking protocol suite described  earlier 
in this chapter. Every computer on the Internet is assigned a unique Internet 
Protocol (IP) address, which currently is a 32-bit number represented by four 
strings of numbers ranging from 0 to 255 separated by periods. For instance, the 
IP address of www.microsoft.com is 207.46.250.119.
When a user sends a message to another user on the Internet, the message is 
first decomposed into packets using the TCP protocol. Each packet contains its 
destination address. The packets are then sent from the client to the  network 
server and from there on to as many other servers as necessary to arrive at a 
specific computer with a known address. At the destination address, the  packets 
are reassembled into the original message.
The Domain Name System
Because it would be incredibly difficult for Internet users to remember strings 
of 12  numbers, the Domain Name System (DNS) converts domain names 
to IP addresses. The domain name is the English-like name that corresponds 
to the unique 32-bit numeric IP address for each computer connected to the 
Internet. DNS servers maintain a database containing IP addresses mapped 
to their  corresponding domain names. To access a computer on the Internet, 
users need only specify its domain name. 
DNS has a hierarchical structure (see Figure 7.6). At the top of the DNS 
 hierarchy is the root domain. The child domain of the root is called a  top-level 
domain, and the child domain of a top-level domain is called a second-level 
domain. Top-level domains are two- and three-character names you are 
 familiar with from surfing the Web, for  example, .com, .edu, .gov, and the 
 various country codes such as .ca for Canada or .it for Italy.  Second-level 
domains have two parts, designating a top-level name and a second-level 
name—such as buy.com, nyu.edu, or amazon.ca. A host name at the bottom 
of the hierarchy designates a specific computer on either the Internet or a 
 private  network.
The most common domain extensions currently available and officially 
approved are shown in the following list. Countries also have domain names 
such as .uk, .au, and .fr (United Kingdom, Australia, and France, respectively), 
and there is a new class of “internationalized” top-level domains that use non-
English characters. In the future, this list will expand to include many more 
types of organizations and industries.

Internet Architecture and Governance
Internet data traffic is carried over transcontinental high-speed backbone 
 networks that  generally operate in the range of 45 Mbps to 2.5 Gbps (see 
Figure 7.7). These trunk lines are typically owned by long-distance telephone 
companies (called network service  providers) or by national governments. 
Local connection lines are owned by regional  telephone and cable television 
 companies in the United States that connect retail users in homes and busi-
nesses to the Internet. The regional networks lease access to ISPs, private 
companies, and government institutions.
Each organization pays for its own networks and its own local Internet 
 connection services, a part of which is paid to the long-distance trunk line 
 owners. Individual Internet users pay ISPs for using their service, and they 
 generally pay a flat subscription fee, no matter how much or how little they 
use the Internet. A debate is now raging on whether this arrangement should 
 continue or whether heavy Internet users who download large video and music 
files should pay more for the bandwidth they consume. The Interactive Session 
on Organizations explores this topic, by examining the pros and cons of net 
 neutrality.
 FIGURE 7.6  THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM
Domain Name System is a hierarchical system with a root domain, top-level domains, second-level 
domains, and host computers at the third level.
300 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

No one “owns” the Internet, and it has no formal management. However, 
worldwide Internet policies are established by a number of professional 
 organizations and government bodies, including the Internet Architecture Board 
(IAB), which helps define the overall structure of the Internet; the Internet 
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which assigns IP 
addresses; and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which sets Hypertext 
Markup Language and other programming standards for the Web. 
These organizations influence government agencies, network owners, 
ISPs, and software developers with the goal of keeping the Internet operat-
ing as efficiently as possible. The Internet must also conform to the laws 
of the  sovereign nation-states in which it operates, as well as the techni-
cal  infrastructures that exist within the nation-states. Although in the early 
years of the Internet and the Web there was very little legislative or executive 
 interference, this situation is changing as the Internet plays a growing role in 
the  distribution of information and knowledge, including content that some 
find objectionable.
ICANN was created by the Department of Commerce in 1986 to manage 
the domain name system, and the central core servers of the Internet 
domains located in the United States. Emerging nations and others have long 
called for the U.S. dominance of the Internet to end, and instead  support a 
 multi-national controlling agency. After the terrorist attacks on the United 
States on September 11, 2001, the U.S. refused to consider such a change. 
This opinion changed again in March 2014 when the Commerce Department 
announced its intention to transfer the domain name functions of the Internet 
 FIGURE 7.7  INTERNET NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
The Internet backbone connects to regional networks, which in turn provide access to Internet service 
providers, large firms, and government  institutions. Network access points (NAPs) and metropolitan 
area exchanges (MAEs) are hubs where the  backbone intersects regional and local networks and 
where backbone owners connect with one another.

What kind of Internet user are you? Do you 
 primarily use the Net to do a little e-mail and 
online banking? Or are you online all day,  watching 
YouTube videos, downloading music files, or 
 playing online games? Do you use your iPhone to 
stream TV shows and movies on a regular basis? If 
you’re a power Internet or smartphone user, you 
are  consuming a great deal of bandwidth. Could 
hundreds of millions of people like you start to slow 
the Internet down?
Video streaming on Netflix accounts for 32 
 percent of all bandwidth use in the United States, 
and Google’s YouTube for 19 percent of Web traffic 
at peak hours. If user demand overwhelms  network 
capacity, the Internet might not come to a screech-
ing halt, but users could face sluggish  download 
speeds and video transmission. Heavy use of 
iPhones in urban areas such as New York and San 
Francisco has already degraded service on the AT&T 
 wireless network. AT&T reported that 3 percent of 
its  subscriber base accounted for 40 percent of its 
data traffic.
Internet service providers (ISPs) assert that 
network congestion is a serious problem and that 
expanding their networks would require passing on 
burdensome costs to consumers. These companies 
believe differential pricing methods, which include 
data caps and metered use—charging based on the 
amount of bandwidth consumed—are the fairest way 
to finance necessary investments in their network 
infrastructures. But metering Internet use is not 
widely accepted, because of an ongoing debate about 
net neutrality.
Net neutrality is the idea that Internet service 
 providers must allow customers equal access to 
content and applications, regardless of the source 
or nature of the content. Presently, the Internet is 
neutral: all Internet traffic is treated equally on a 
first-come, first-served basis by Internet  backbone 
owners. However, this arrangement prevents 
 telecommunications and cable companies from 
charging differentiated prices based on the amount 
of bandwidth consumed by the content being 
 delivered over the Internet. 
The strange alliance of net neutrality advocates 
includes MoveOn.org; the Christian Coalition; the 
American Library Association; data-intensive Web 
businesses such as Netflix, Amazon, and Google; 
major consumer groups; and a host of bloggers and 
small businesses. Net neutrality advocates argue that 
differentiated pricing would impose heavy costs on 
heavy bandwidth users such as YouTube, Skype, and 
other innovative services, preventing high-bandwidth 
startup companies from gaining traction. Net neutral-
ity supporters also argue that without net neutrality, 
ISPs that are also cable companies, such as Comcast, 
might block online streaming video from Netflix or 
Hulu in order to force customers to use the cable 
company’s on-demand movie rental services. 
Network owners believe regulation to enforce 
net neutrality will impede U.S. competitiveness by 
discouraging capital expenditure for new networks 
and curbing their networks’ ability to cope with the 
exploding demand for Internet and wireless traffic. 
U.S. Internet service lags behind many other nations 
in overall speed, cost, and quality of service, add-
ing credibility to this argument. And with enough 
options for Internet access, dissatisfied consumers 
could simply switch to providers who enforce net 
neutrality and allow unlimited Internet use.
The wireless industry had been largely exempted 
from net neutrality rules, because the government 
determined it was a less mature network and compa-
nies should be allowed more freedom to manage traf-
fic. Wireless providers already have tiered plans that 
charge heavy bandwidth users larger service fees.
A December 2012 report by the non-profit, non-
partisan, public policy institute, New America 
Foundation (NAF), disputes these claims. Like 
personal computers, the processing capacity of the 
routers and switches in wired broadband networks 
has vastly expanded while the price has declined. 
Although total U.S. Internet data consumption 
rose 120% in 2012, the cost to transport the data 
decreased at a faster pace. The net cost to carriers 
was at worst flat and for the most part, down. The 
NAF report further asserts that lack of competition 
has enabled wired broadband carriers to charge 
higher rates, institute data caps, and spend less on 
the capital expenditures needed to upgrade and 
maintain their networks than they have in the past. 
The courts have maintained that the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) has no author-
ity to dictate how the Internet operates. The 
Communications Act of 1996 forbids the agency from 
managing the Internet as a “common carrier,” the

regulatory approach the commission took toward 
telephones, and the FCC itself decided not to classify 
broadband as a telecommunications service. 
On January 14, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia struck down the FCC’s 
“Open Internet” rules that required equal treatment 
of Internet traffic and prevented broadband providers 
from blocking traffic favoring certain sites or charg-
ing special fees to companies that account for the 
most traffic. The court said the FCC saddled broad-
band  providers with the same sorts of obligations as 
traditional “common carrier” telecommunications 
services, such as landline phone systems, even though 
the commission had explicitly decided not to classify 
broadband as a telecommunications service. 
On April 24, 2014, the FCC announced that it 
would propose new rules that allow companies like 
Disney, Google or Netflix to pay Internet service 
providers like Comcast and Verizon for special, 
faster lanes to send video and other content to their 
 customers. Broadband providers would have to dis-
close how they treat all Internet traffic and on what 
terms they offer more rapid lanes, and would be 
required to act in a “commercially reasonable man-

ner.” Providers would not be allowed to block Web 
sites. The proposed rules would also require Internet 
service providers to disclose whether, in assign-
ing faster lanes, they had favored their affiliated 
 companies that provide content. 
Nevertheless, the FCC continues to push for an 
open Internet. On April 30, 2014, FCC chairman Tom 
Wheeler announced that lack of competition has 
hurt consumers, and that the FCC planned to write 
tough new rules to enforce net neutrality.

quantities of data and billions of users. Because of sheer Internet population 
growth, the world is about to run out of available IP addresses using the old 
addressing convention. The old addressing system is being replaced by a new 
version of the IP addressing schema called IPv6 (Internet Protocol  version 6), 
which  contains 128-bit addresses (2 to the power of 128), or more than a quadril-
lion possible unique addresses. IPv6 is not compatible with the  existing Internet 
addressing system, so the transition to the new standard will take years.
Internet2 is an advanced networking consortium representing over 350 U.S. 
 universities, private businesses, and government agencies working with 66,000 
institutions across the United States and international networking partners 
from more than 100 countries. To connect these communities, Internet2 devel-
oped a high-capacity 100 Gbps network that serves as a testbed for leading-
edge technologies that may eventually migrate to the  public Internet, including 
telemedicine, distance learning, and other advanced applications not  possible 
with consumer-grade Internet services. The fourth generation of this network 
is being rolled out to provide 8.8  terabits of capacity.
INTERNET SERVICES AND COMMUNICATION TOOLS
The Internet is based on client/server technology. Individuals using the 
Internet  control what they do through client applications on their  computers, 
such as Web browser  software. The data, including e-mail messages and Web 
pages, are stored on servers. A client uses the Internet to request information 
from a particular Web server on a  distant computer, and the server sends the 
requested information back to the client over the Internet. Chapters 5 and 6 
describe how Web servers work with application servers and database  servers 
to access information from an organization’s internal information  systems 
 applications and their associated databases. Client platforms today include not 
only PCs and other  computers but also smartphones and tablets.
Internet Services
A client computer connecting to the Internet has access to a variety of  services. 
These  services include e-mail, chatting and instant messaging, electronic 
 discussion groups, Telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and the Web. Table 7.3 
provides a brief description of these services.
Each Internet service is implemented by one or more software programs. All 
of the services may run on a single server computer, or different services may 
be allocated to  different machines. Figure 7.8 illustrates one way that these 
 services can be arranged in a multitiered client/server architecture.
E-mail enables messages to be exchanged from computer to computer, with 
 capabilities for routing messages to multiple recipients, forwarding  messages, 
and attaching text  documents or multimedia files to messages. Most e-mail today 
is sent through the Internet. The cost of e-mail is far lower than  equivalent 
voice, postal, or overnight delivery costs, and e-mail messages arrive  anywhere 
in the world in a matter of seconds.
Nearly 90 percent of U.S. workplaces have employees communicating 
 interactively using chat or instant messaging tools. Chatting enables two or 
more people who are  simultaneously connected to the Internet to hold live,

interactive conversations. Chat systems now support voice and video chat as 
well as written conversations. Many online retail businesses offer chat services 
on their Web sites to attract visitors, to encourage repeat purchases, and to 
improve customer service. 
Instant messaging is a type of chat service that enables participants to 
 create their own private chat channels. The instant messaging system alerts 
the user whenever  someone on his or her private list is online so that the user 
can initiate a chat session with other  individuals. Instant messaging systems 
for consumers include Yahoo! Messenger, Google Talk, AOL Instant Messenger, 
and Facebook Chat. Companies concerned with security use proprietary 
 communications and  messaging systems such as IBM Sametime. 
Newsgroups are worldwide discussion groups posted on Internet electronic 
bulletin boards on which people share information and ideas on a defined topic, 
such as radiology or rock bands. Anyone can post messages on these bulletin 
boards for others to read. Many thousands of groups exist that discuss almost all 
conceivable topics.

Employee use of e-mail, instant messaging, and the Internet is supposed 
to increase worker productivity, but the accompanying Interactive Session 
on Management shows that this may not always be the case. Many company 
 managers now believe they need to monitor and even regulate their employ-
ees’ online activity. But is this ethical? Although there are some strong business 
reasons why companies may need to monitor their employees’ e-mail and Web 
activities, what does this mean for employee privacy?
Voice over IP
The Internet has also become a popular platform for voice transmission 
and corporate  networking. Voice over IP (VoIP) technology delivers voice 
 information in digital form using packet switching, avoiding the tolls charged 
by local and long-distance telephone  networks (see Figure 7.9). Calls that 
would ordinarily be transmitted over public telephone networks travel over the 
 corporate network based on the Internet Protocol, or the public Internet. Voice 
calls can be made and received with a computer equipped with a microphone 
and speakers or with a VoIP-enabled telephone.
Cable firms such as Time Warner and Cablevision provide VoIP service 
 bundled with their high-speed Internet and cable offerings. Skype offers free 
VoIP worldwide using a peer-to-peer network, and Google has its own free VoIP 
service. 
Although there are up-front investments required for an IP phone system, 
VoIP can reduce communication and network management costs by 20 to 30 
percent. For  example, VoIP saves Virgin Entertainment Group $700,000 per 
year in long-distance bills. In  addition to lowering long-distance costs and 
 eliminating monthly fees for private lines, an IP  network provides a single 
voice-data infrastructure for both telecommunications and computing  services. 
Companies no longer have to maintain separate networks or provide support 
 services and personnel for each different type of network.

 communications, and videoconferencing operated independently of each 
 FIGURE 7.9 
HOW VOICE OVER IP WORKS
A VoIP phone call digitizes and breaks up a voice message into data packets that may travel along different routes before being reas-
sembled at the final destination. A processor nearest the call’s destination, called a gateway, arranges the packets in the proper order and 
directs them to the telephone number of the receiver or the IP address of the receiving computer.

MONITORING EMPLOYEES ON NETWORKS: UNETHICAL OR GOOD 
BUSINESS?
The Internet has become an extremely valuable 
 business tool, but it’s also a huge distraction for 
workers on the job. Employees are wasting  valuable 
company time by surfing inappropriate Web sites 
(Facebook, shopping, sports, etc.), sending and 
receiving personal email, talking to friends via online 
chat, and downloading videos and music. According 
to IT research firm Gartner Inc.,  non-work-related 
Internet surfing results in an  estimated 40% 
 productivity loss each year for American  businesses. 
A recent Gallup Poll found that the average 
employee spends over 75 minutes per day using 
office computers for non-business related activity. 
That translates into an annual loss of $6,250 per year, 
per employee. An average mid-size company of 500 
employees could be expected to lose $3.25 million in 
lost productivity due to Internet misuse.
Many companies have begun monitoring 
employee use of e-mail and the Internet, sometimes 
without their knowledge. Many tools are now avail-
able for this purpose, including SONAR, Spector 
CNE Investigator, iSafe, OsMonitor, IMonitor, Work 
Examiner, Net Spy, Activity Monitor, Mobistealth, 
and Spytech. These products enable companies to 
record online searches, monitor file downloads and 
uploads, record keystrokes, keep tabs on emails, cre-
ate transcripts of chats, or take certain screenshots of 
images displayed on computer screens. Instant mes-
saging, text messaging, and social media monitoring 
are also increasing. Although U.S. companies have 
the legal right to monitor employee Internet and 
e-mail activity while they are at work, is such moni-
toring unethical, or is it simply good business?
Managers worry about the loss of time and 
employee productivity when employees are  focusing 
on personal rather than company business. Too 
much time on personal business translates into lost 
revenue. Some employees may even be billing time 
they spend pursuing personal interests online to 
 clients, thus  overcharging them.
If personal traffic on company networks is too 
high, it can also clog the company’s network so 
that legitimate business work cannot be performed. 
Procter & Gamble (P&G) found that on an average 
day, employees were listening to 4,000 hours of 
music on Pandora and viewing 50,000 five-minute 
YouTube videos. These activities involved streaming 
huge quantities of data, which slowed down P&G’s 
Internet connection. 
 When employees use e-mail or the Web 
 (including social networks) at employer facilities 
or with employer equipment, anything they do, 
 including anything illegal, carries the company’s 
name. Therefore, the employer can be traced 
and held liable. Management in many firms fear 
that racist,  sexually explicit, or other potentially 
 offensive material accessed or traded by their 
employees could result in adverse publicity and 
even lawsuits for the firm. An estimated 27 percent 
of Fortune 500 organizations have had to defend 
themselves against claims of sexual harassment 
stemming from inappropriate email. Even if the 
company is found not to be liable, responding to 
lawsuits could run up huge legal bills. Symantec’s 
2011 Social Media Protection Flash Poll found that 
the average litigation cost for companies with social 
media incidents ran over $650,000.
Companies also fear leakage of confidential 
 information and trade secrets through e-mail or 
social networks. Another survey conducted by the 
American Management Association and the ePolicy 
Institute found that 14 percent of the employees 
polled admitted they had sent confidential or poten-
tially embarrassing company e-mails to outsiders. 
U.S. companies have the legal right to  monitor 
what employees are doing with company  equipment 
during business hours. The question is whether 
 electronic surveillance is an appropriate tool for 
maintaining an efficient and positive workplace. 
Some companies try to ban all personal activities on 
corporate networks—zero tolerance. Others block 
employee access to specific Web sites or social sites, 
closely monitor e-mail messages, or limit personal 
time on the Web. 
For example, P&G blocks Netflix and has asked 
employees to limit their use of Pandora. It still allows 
some YouTube viewing, and is not blocking access 
to social networking sites because staff use them for 
digital marketing campaigns. Ajax Boiler in Santa 
Ana, California, uses software from SpectorSoft 
Corporation that records all the Web sites employees 
visit, time spent at each site, and all e-mails sent.

Securities monitors the daily e-mails, instant messag-

ing, and social networking activity of its 1,000-plus 
employees. The firm’s e-mail monitoring software 
flags certain types of messages and keywords within 
messages for further investigation. 
A number of firms have fired employees who 
have stepped out of bounds. A Proofpoint survey 
found that one in five large U.S. companies fired an 
employee for violating e-mail policies in the past 
year. Among managers who fired employees for 
Internet misuse, the majority did so because the 
employees’ e-mail  contained sensitive, confidential, 
or embarrassing information. 
No solution is problem-free, but many consultants 
believe companies should write corporate policies 
on employee e-mail, social media, and Web use. The 
policies should include explicit ground rules that 
state, by position or level, under what  circumstances 
employees can use company facilities for e-mail, 
blogging, or Web surfing. The policies should also 
inform employees whether these activities are 
 monitored and explain why.
IBM now has “social computing guidelines” that 
cover employee activity on sites such as Facebook 
and Twitter. The guidelines urge employees not to

conceal their identities, to remember that they are 
personally responsible for what they publish, and to 
refrain from discussing controversial topics that are 
not related to their IBM role. 
The rules should be tailored to specific business 
needs and organizational cultures. For example, 
investment firms will need to allow many of their 
employees access to other investment sites. A 
 company dependent on widespread information 
sharing, innovation, and independence could very 
well find that monitoring creates more problems 
than it solves.

other and had to be managed  separately by the information systems depart-
ment. Now, however, firms are able to merge disparate communications 
modes into a single universally accessible service using unified communica-
tions technology. Unified communications integrates disparate channels for 
voice  communications, data communications, instant messaging, e-mail, and 
 electronic  conferencing into a single experience where users can seamlessly 
switch back and forth between different communication modes. Presence 
 technology shows whether a person is available to receive a call. Companies 
will need to examine how work flows and business processes will be altered by 
this technology in order to gauge its value.

 company, used  unified communications technology to create collaborative 
Web sites for each of its real estate deals. Each Web site provides a single point

Virtual Private Networks
What if you had a marketing group charged with developing new products and 
services for your firm with members spread across the United States? You would 
want them to be able to e-mail each other and communicate with the home 
office without any chance that  outsiders could intercept the communications. 
In the past, one answer to this problem was to work with large private network-
ing firms who offered secure, private, dedicated networks to  customers. But this 
was an expensive solution. A much less-expensive solution is to create a virtual 
private network within the public Internet.
A virtual private network (VPN) is a secure, encrypted, private network 
that has been configured within a public network to take advantage of the 
economies of scale and  management facilities of large networks, such as the 
Internet (see Figure 7.10). A VPN  provides your firm with secure, encrypted 
communications at a much lower cost than the same capabilities offered by 
 traditional non-Internet providers who use their private  networks to secure 
communications. VPNs also provide a network infrastructure for  combining 
voice and data networks. 
Several competing protocols are used to protect data transmitted over the 
public Internet, including Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). In a process 
called tunneling, packets of data are encrypted and wrapped inside IP packets. 
By adding this wrapper around a network message to hide its content, business 
firms create a private connection that travels through the public Internet.
THE WEB
The Web is the most  popular Internet service. It’s a  system with univer-
sally accepted standards for  storing, retrieving, formatting, and  displaying 
 information using a client/server  architecture. Web pages are formatted using 
hypertext with embedded links that connect documents to one another and 
that also link pages to other objects, such as sound, video, or animation files. 
When you click a graphic and a video clip plays, you have clicked a hyperlink. 
A typical Web site is a  collection of Web pages linked to a home page. 
 FIGURE 7.10 A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK USING THE INTERNET
This VPN is a private network of computers linked using a secure “tunnel” connection over the 
Internet. It protects data transmitted over the public Internet by encoding the data and “wrapping” 
them within the Internet Protocol (IP). By adding a wrapper around a network message to hide its 
content, organizations can create a private connection that travels through the public Internet.
 
Chapter 7 Telecommunications, the Internet, and Wireless Technology 
309

Hypertext
Web pages are based on a standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which 
formats documents and incorporates dynamic links to other  documents and 
pictures stored in the same or remote computers (see Chapter 5). Web pages are 
accessible through the Internet because Web browser software  operating your 
computer can request Web pages stored on an Internet host server using the 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is the  communications stan-
dard used to transfer pages on the Web. For example, when you type a Web 
address in your browser, such as http://www.sec.gov, your browser sends an 
HTTP request to the sec.gov server requesting the home page of sec.gov.
HTTP is the first set of letters at the start of every Web address, followed by 
the domain name, which specifies the organization’s server computer that is 
storing the  document. Most companies have a domain name that is the same 
as or closely related to their official corporate name. The directory path and 
document name are two more pieces of information within the Web address 
that help the browser track down the requested page. Together, the address 
is called a uniform resource locator (URL). When typed into a browser, a 
URL tells the browser software exactly where to look for the information. For 
example, in the URL http://www.megacorp.com/content/features/082610.html, 
http names the protocol used to display Web pages, www.megacorp.com is the 
domain name, content/features is the directory path that identifies where on 
the domain Web server the page is stored, and 082610.html is the document 
name and the name of the  format it is in (it is an HTML page).
Web Servers
A Web server is software for locating and managing stored Web pages. It locates 
the Web pages requested by a user on the computer where they are stored and 
delivers the Web pages to the user’s computer. Server applications usually run 
on dedicated computers, although they can all reside on a single computer in 
small organizations.
The most common Web server in use today is Apache HTTP Server, followed 
by Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). Apache is an open source 
product that is free of charge and can be downloaded from the Web. 
Searching for Information on the Web
No one knows for sure how many Web pages there really are. The surface Web 
is the part of the Web that search engines visit and about which information is 
recorded. For instance, Google visited an estimated 600 billion pages in 2013, 
and this reflects a large portion of the  publicly accessible Web page population. 
But there is a “deep Web” that contains an  estimated 1 trillion additional pages, 
many of them proprietary (such as the pages of the Wall Street Journal Online, 
which cannot be visited without a subscription or access code) or that are stored 
in  protected corporate databases. Searching for information on Facebook is 
another matter. With an estimated 1.3 billion members, each with pages of text, 
photos, and media, the population of Web pages is larger than many estimates. 
But Facebook is a “closed” Web, and its pages are not searchable by Google or 
other search engines. 
Search Engines Obviously, with so many Web pages, finding specific Web 
pages that can help you or your business, nearly instantly, is an important 
problem. The question is, how can you find the one or two pages you really 
want and need out of billions of indexed Web pages? Search engines attempt to 
solve the problem of finding useful information on the Web nearly instantly, 
310 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

and, arguably, they are the “killer app” of the Internet era. Today’s search 
engines can sift through HTML files, files of Microsoft Office applications, PDF 
files, as well as audio, video, and image files. There are hundreds of different 
search engines in the world, but the vast majority of search results are supplied 
by Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft’s Bing (see Figure 7.11).
Web search engines started out in the early 1990s as relatively simple 
 software programs that roamed the nascent Web, visiting pages and gather-
ing information about the content of each page. The first search engines were 
simple  keyword indexes of all the pages they  visited, leaving the user with lists 
of pages that may not have been truly relevant to their search. 
In 1994, Stanford University computer science students David Filo and Jerry 
Yang  created a hand-selected list of their favorite Web pages and called it “Yet 
Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle,” or Yahoo. Yahoo was not  initially a 
search engine but rather an edited selection of Web sites organized by  categories 
the editors found useful. Currently Yahoo relies on Microsoft’s Bing for search 
results. 
In 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two other Stanford computer science 
 students, released their first version of Google. This search engine was  different: 
Not only did it index each Web page’s words but it also ranked search results 
based on the relevance of each page. Page patented the idea of a page ranking 
system (called PageRank System), which essentially measures the popularity of 
a Web page by calculating the number of sites that link to that page as well as the 
number of pages to which it links. The premise is that really popular Web pages 
are more “relevant” to users. Brin contributed a unique Web crawler program that 
indexed not only keywords on a page but also combinations of words (such as 
authors and the titles of their articles). These two ideas became the foundation 
for the Google search engine. Figure 7.12 illustrates how Google works.
Mobile Search With the growth of mobile smartphones and tablet computers, 
and with about 167 million Americans accessing the Internet via mobile 
devices, the nature of  e-commerce and search is changing. Mobile search from 
smartphones and tablets made up about 50 percent of all searches in 2014, and 
 FIGURE 7.11 TOP WEB SEARCH ENGINES IN THE UNITED STATES

States and around 90% in Europe..

according to Google will expand rapidly in the next few years. Both Google and 
Yahoo have developed new search interfaces to make searching and shopping 
from smartphones more convenient. Amazon, for instance, sold over $1 billion 
in goods in 2013 through mobile searches of its store  (Search Agency, 2013). 
While smartphones are widely used to shop, actual purchases typically take 
place on laptops or desktops, followed by tablets. 
Search Engine Marketing Search engines have become major advertising 
platforms and shopping tools by offering what is now called search engine 
marketing. Searching for information is one of the Web’s most popular activi-
ties: 60% of American adult Internet users use a search engine at least once a 
day, generating about 90 billion queries a month. With this huge audience, 
search engines are the foundation for the most lucrative form of online market-
ing and advertising, search engine marketing. When users enter a search term 
at Google, Bing, Yahoo, or any of the other sites serviced by these search 
engines, they receive two types of  listings: sponsored links, for which advertis-
ers have paid to be listed (usually at the top of the search results page), and 
unsponsored “organic” search results. In addition,  advertisers can purchase 
small text boxes on the side of search results pages. The paid,  sponsored adver-
tisements are the fastest growing form of Internet advertising and are  powerful 
new marketing tools that precisely match consumer interests with advertising 
 messages at the right moment. Search engine marketing monetizes the value of 
the search process. In 2014, search engine marketing is expected to generate 
$22.8 billion in revenue, nearly half of all online advertising ($51 billion). 
 FIGURE 7.12 HOW GOOGLE WORKS
The Google search engine is continuously crawling the Web, indexing the content of each page, calculating its popularity, and storing the pages so that it can respond quickly 
to user requests to see a page. The entire process takes about one-half second.
312 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

Google will for over 38% of all online  advertising in 2014. About 97% of Google’s 
revenue of $60 billion in 2013 came from online advertising, and 95% of the ad 
revenue came from search engine marketing (Google, 2014). 
Because search engine marketing is so effective (it has the highest 
 click-through rate and the highest return on ad investment), companies seek 
to  optimize their Web sites for search engine recognition. The better optimized 
the page is, the higher a ranking it will achieve in search engine result listings. 
Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality 
and volume of Web traffic to a Web site by employing a series of techniques 
that help a Web site achieve a higher ranking with the major search engines 
when certain keywords and phrases are put into the search field. One tech-
nique is to make sure that the keywords used in the Web site description match 
the  keywords likely to be used as search terms by prospective customers. For 
example, your Web site is more likely to be among the first ranked by search 
engines if it uses the keyword “lighting” rather than “lamps” if most prospec-
tive  customers are searching for “lighting.” It is also advantageous to link your 
Web site to as many other Web sites as possible because search engines evalu-
ate such links to determine the popularity of a Web page and how it is linked 
to other content on the Web. Search engines can be gamed by scammers who 
create thousands of phony Web site pages and link them altogether, or link 
them to a single retailer’s site in an attempt to fool Google’s search engine. 
Firms can also pay so-called “link farms” to link to their site. Google changed its 
search algorithm in 2012. Codenamed “Penguin,” the new algorithm examines 
the quality of links more carefully with the intent of down ranking sites that 
have a suspicious pattern of sites linking to them. Penguin is updated annually 
and published.
Google and other search engine firms are attempting to refine search engine 
algorithms to capture more of what the user intended, and more the “mean-
ing” of a search. Google introduced Hummingbird, its new search algorithm in 
September 2013. Rather than evaluate each word separately in a search, Google’s 
semantically informed Hummingbird will try to evaluate an entire sentence. 
So, if your search is a long sentence like “Google annual report selected finan-
cial data 2013,” Hummingbird should be able to figure out that you really want 
the SEC Form 10k report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
on March 31, 2014. How about “Italian restaurant Brooklyn Bridge”? This will 
return the name and location of a number of Italian restaurants in vicinity 
of the Brooklyn Bridge. Semantic search more closely follows conversational 
search, or search as you would ordinarily speak it to another human being. 
Google’s predictive search is now a part of most search results. In predictive 
search, this part of the search algorithm guesses what you are looking for, 
and suggests search terms as you enter your search. Google searches also take 
advantage of Knowledge Graph, an effort of the search algorithm to anticipate 
what you might want to know more about as you search on a topic. Results of 
the knowledge graph appear on the right of the screen and contain more infor-
mation about the topic or person you are searching on.
In general, search engines have been very helpful to small businesses that 
cannot afford large marketing campaigns. Because shoppers are looking for a spe-
cific product or  service when they use search engines, they are what  marketers 
call “hot prospects”— people who are looking for information and often intend-
ing to buy. Moreover, search engines charge only for click-throughs to a site. 
Merchants do not have to pay for ads that don’t work, only for ads that receive 
a click. Consumers benefit from search engine marketing because ads for mer-
chants appear only when consumers are looking for a specific product. There 
 
Chapter 7 Telecommunications, the Internet, and Wireless Technology 
313

are no pop-ups, Flash animations, videos, interstitials, e-mails, or other irrelevant 
communications to deal with. Thus, search engine marketing saves consumers 
cognitive energy and reduces search costs (including the cost of transportation 
needed to physically search for products). One study estimated the global value 
of search to both merchants and consumers to be more than $800 billion, with 
about 65 percent of the benefit going to consumers in the form of lower search 
costs and lower prices (McKinsey, 2011). Google and Microsoft face challenges 
ahead as desktop PC search growth slows, and  revenues decline because the 
price of search engine ads is declining slightly. The growth in mobile search does 
not make up for the loss of desktop search revenues because mobile ads sell for 
generally half as much as desktop search ads. 
Social Search One problem with Google and mechanical search engines is 
that they are so thorough: Enter a search for “ultra computers” and in .2  seconds 
you will receive over 300 million reponses! Search engines are not very 
 discriminating. Social search is an effort to provide fewer, more relevant, and 
trustworthy search results based on a  person’s network of social contacts. In 
contrast to the top search engines that use a mathematical algorithm to find 
pages that satisfy your query, a social search Web site would review your 
friends’ recommendations (and their friends’), their past Web visits, and their 
use of “Like” buttons. 
In January 2013 Facebook launched Graph Search, a social network search 
engine that responds to user search queries with information from the user’s 
social network of friends and connections. Graph Search relies upon the huge 
amount of data on Facebook that is, or can be, linked to individuals and organi-
zations. You might use Graph Search to search for Boston restaurants that your 
friends like, alumni from the University of South Carolina who like Lady Gaga, 
or pictures of your friends before 2010. Google has developed Google +1 as a 
social layer on top of its existing search engine. Users can place a +1 next to the 
Web sites they found helpful, and their friends will be notified automatically. 
Subsequent searches by their friends would list the +1 sites recommended by 
friends higher up on the page. One problem with social search is that your close 
friends may not have  intimate knowledge of topics you are exploring, or they 
may have tastes you don’t appreciate. It’s also possible your close friends don’t 
have any knowledge about what you are searching for. 
Semantic Search Another way for search engines to become more discrimi-
nating and helpful is to make search engines that could understand what it is 
we are really looking for. Called “semantic search” the goal is to build a search 
engine that could really understand human language and behavior. For instance, 
in 2012 Google’s search engine began delivering more than millions of links. It 
started to give users more facts and direct answers, and to provide more  relevant 
links to sites based on the search engine’s estimation of what the user intended, 
and even on the user’s past search behavior. Google’s search engine is trying to 
understand what people are most likely thinking about when they search for 
something. Google hopes to use its massive database of objects (people, places, 
things), and smart software to provide users better results than just millions of 
hits. For instance, do a search on “Lake Tahoe” and the search engine will return 
basic facts about Tahoe (altitude, average temperature, and local fish), a map, 
and hotel accommodations (Efrati, 2012).
Although search engines were originally designed to search text docu-
ments, the explosion of photos and videos on the Internet created a demand 
for  searching and classifying these visual objects. Facial recognition software 
can create a digital version of a human face. In 2012 Facebook introduced 
314 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

its facial recognition software and combined it with tagging, to create a new 
feature called Tag Suggest. The software creates a digital facial print, similar 
to a finger print. Users can put their own tagged photo on their timeline, and 
their friend’s timelines. Once a person’s photo is tagged, Facebook can pick 
that person out of a group photo, and identify for others who is in the photo. 
You can also search for people on Facebook using their digital image to find 
and identify them. 
Intelligent Agent Shopping Bots Chapter 11 describes the capabilities of 
software agents with built-in intelligence that can gather or filter information 
and perform other tasks to assist users. Shopping bots use intelligent agent 
software for searching the Internet for shopping information. Shopping bots 
such as MySimon or PriceGrabber can help people interested in  making a 
 purchase filter and retrieve information about products of interest, evaluate 
competing products according to criteria the users have established, and 
 negotiate with vendors for price and delivery terms. Many of these  shopping 
agents search the Web for pricing and availability of products specified by the 
user and return a list of sites that sell the item along with pricing information 
and a purchase link.
Web 2.0
Today’s Web sites don’t just contain static content—they enable people to 
 collaborate, share information, and create new services and content online. 
These second-generation  interactive Internet-based services are referred to as 
Web 2.0. If you have shared photos over the Internet at Flickr or another photo 
site, pinned a photo on Pinterest, posted a video to YouTube, created a blog, 
or added an app to your Facebook page, you’ve used some of these Web 2.0 
services.
Web 2.0 has four defining features: interactivity, real-time user control, social 
 participation (sharing), and user-generated content. The technologies and 
 services behind these features include cloud computing, software  mashups and 
apps, blogs, RSS, wikis, and social networks.
Mashups, which we introduced in Chapter 5, are software  services that enable 
users and system developers to mix and match content or software  components 
to create something entirely new. For example, Yahoo’s photo  storage and 
 sharing site Flickr combines  photos with other information about the images 
provided by users and tools to make it usable within other  programming 
 environments. Web 2.0 tools and services have fueled the  creation of social 
networks and other online communities where people can interact with one 
another in the manner of their choosing. 
A blog, the popular term for a Weblog, is a personal Web site that typically 
contains a series of chronological entries (newest to oldest) by its author, and 
links to related Web pages. Blogging is a major activity for U.S. Internet users: 
74 million read blogs, and 22 million write blogs or post to blogs. The blog may 
include a blogroll (a collection of links to other blogs) and trackbacks (a list of 
entries in other blogs that refer to a post on the first blog). Most blogs allow 
readers to post comments on the blog entries as well. The act of creating a blog 
is often referred to as “blogging.” Blogs can be hosted by a third-party service 
such as Blogger.com, TypePad.com, and Xanga.com, and blogging features have 
been incorporated into social networks such as Facebook and collaboration 
platforms such as Lotus Notes. WordPress is a leading open source blogging tool 
and content management system. Microblogging, used in Twitter, is a type of 
blogging that features short posts of 140 characters or less.
 
Chapter 7 Telecommunications, the Internet, and Wireless Technology 
315

Blog pages are usually variations on templates provided by the blogging 
 service or  software. Therefore, millions of people without HTML skills of any 
kind can post their own Web pages and share content with others. The totality 
of blog-related Web sites is often referred to as the blogosphere. Although blogs 
have become popular personal publishing tools, they also have business uses 
(see Chapters 2 and 10). 
If you’re an avid blog reader, you might use RSS to keep up with your  favorite 
blogs  without constantly checking them for updates. RSS, which stands for 
Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary, pulls specified content from 
Web sites and feeds it  automatically to users’ computers. RSS reader software 
gathers material from the Web sites or blogs that you tell it to scan and brings 
new information from those sites to you. RSS readers are available through Web 
sites such as Google and Yahoo, and they have been incorporated into the major 
Web browsers and e-mail programs.
Blogs allow visitors to add comments to the original content, but they do not 
allow visitors to change the original posted material. Wikis, in contrast, are 
 collaborative Web sites where visitors can add, delete, or modify content on the 
site, including the work of  previous authors. Wiki comes from the Hawaiian 
word for “quick.” 
Wiki software typically provides a template that defines layout and elements 
common to all pages, displays user-editable software program code, and then 
renders the content into an HTML-based page for display in a Web browser. 
Some wiki software allows only basic text formatting, whereas other tools allow 
the use of tables, images, or even interactive elements, such as polls or games. 
Most wikis provide capabilities for monitoring the work of other users and 
 correcting mistakes.
Because wikis make information sharing so easy, they have many business 
uses. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s National Cyber Security 
Center (NCSC) deployed a wiki to facilitate collaboration among federal  agencies 
on cybersecurity. NCSC and other agencies use the wiki for real-time informa-
tion sharing on threats, attacks, and responses and as a repository for techni-
cal and standards information. Pixar Wiki is a collaborative community wiki 
for publicizing the work of Pixar Animation Studios. The wiki format allows 
anyone to create or edit an article about a Pixar film.
Social networking sites enable users to build communities of friends and 
professional colleagues. Members typically create a “profile,” a Web page for 
posting photos,  videos, MP3 files, and text, and then share these profiles with 
others on the service identified as their “friends” or contacts. Social  networking 
sites are highly interactive, offer real-time user control, rely on user-generated 
content, and are broadly based on social participation and  sharing of content 
and opinions. Leading social networking sites include Facebook, Twitter (with 
1.3 billion and 270 million monthly active users respectively in 2014), and 
LinkedIn (for professional contacts). 
For many, social networking sites are the defining Web 2.0 application, 
and one that has radically changed how people spend their time online; how 
people communicate and with whom; how business people stay in touch with 
 customers, suppliers, and employees; how providers of goods and  services 
learn about their customers; and how advertisers reach potential custom-
ers. The large social networking sites are also morphing into  application 
 development  platforms where members can create and sell  software applica-
tions to other members of the community. Facebook alone has over 1 million 
developers who created over 550,000 applications for  gaming, video sharing, 
and  communicating with friends and  family. We talk more about business 
316 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

 applications of social  networking in Chapters 2 and 10, and you can find social 
networking discussions in many other chapters of this book. You can also find a 
more detailed discussion of Web 2.0 in our Learning Tracks.
Web 3.0 and the Future Web
Americans conducted about 19 billion searches in January 2014 (comScore, 
2014). How many of these produced a meaningful result (a useful answer in 
the first three listings)? Arguably, fewer than half. Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, 
and Amazon are all trying to increase the odds of people finding meaningful 
answers to search engine queries. But with over 500 billion Web pages indexed, 
the means available for finding the  information you really want are quite primi-
tive, based on the words used on the pages, and the relative popularity of the 
page among people who use those same search terms. In other words, it’s hit 
or miss.
To a large extent, the future of the Web involves developing techniques 
to make searching the 500 billion public Web pages more productive and 
 meaningful for ordinary people. Web 1.0 solved the problem of obtaining access 
to information. Web 2.0 solved the problem of sharing that information with 
others and building new Web experiences. Web 3.0 is the promise of a future 
Web where all this digital information, all these  contacts, can be woven together 
into a single meaningful experience. 
Sometimes this is referred to as the Semantic Web. “Semantic” refers to 
 meaning. Most of the Web’s content today is designed for humans to read and 
for computers to  display, not for computer programs to analyze and manipu-
late. Semantic Search, described above, is a subset of a larger effort to make 
the Web more intelligent, more humanlike (W3C, 2012). Search engines can 
 discover when a particular term or keyword appears in a Web document, but 
they do not really understand its meaning or how it relates to other informa-
tion on the Web. You can check this out on Google by entering two searches. 
First, enter “Paris Hilton”. Next, enter “Hilton in Paris”. Because Google does not 
understand ordinary English, it has no idea that you are interested in the Hilton 
Hotel in Paris in the second search. Because it cannot understand the meaning 
of pages it has indexed, Google’s search engine returns the most popular pages 
for those queries where “Hilton” and “Paris” appear on the pages. 
First described in a 2001 Scientific American article, the Semantic Web is a 
 collaborative effort led by the World Wide Web Consortium to add a layer of 
meaning atop the existing Web to reduce the amount of human involvement 
in searching for and processing Web information. For instance, the New York 
Times launched a semantic application called Longitude which provides a 
graphical interface to access the Times content. You can ask for stories about 
Germany in the last 24 hours, or a city in the United States, to retrieve all recent 
stories in the Times.
Views on the future of the Web vary, but they generally focus on ways 
to make the Web more “intelligent,” with machine-facilitated understanding 
of information  promoting a more intuitive and effective user experience. 
For instance, let’s say you want to set up a party with your tennis buddies 
at a local restaurant Friday night after work. One problem is that you are 
already  scheduled to go to a movie with another friend. In a Semantic Web 3.0 
 environment, you would be able to coordinate this change in plans with the 
schedules of your tennis buddies and the schedule of your movie friend, and 
make a reservation at the restaurant all with a single set of commands issued 
as text or voice to your handheld smartphone. Right now, this capability is 
beyond our grasp. 
 
Chapter 7 Telecommunications, the Internet, and Wireless Technology 
317

Work proceeds slowly on making the Web a more intelligent experience, in 
large part because it is difficult to make machines, including software  programs, 
that are truly intelligent like humans. But there are other views of the future 
Web. Some see a 3-D Web where you can walk through pages in a 3-D environ-
ment. Others point to the idea of a pervasive Web that controls everything from 
a city’s traffic lights and water usage, to the lights in your living room, to your 
car’s rear view mirror, not to mention managing your calendar and appoint-
ments. This is referred to as the “Internet of Things.”
The Internet of Things includes the widespread use and distribution of 
 sensors. Firms like IBM, HP, and Oracle are exploring how to build smart 
machines, factories, and cities through extensive use of remote sensors and fast 
cloud computing. We provide more detail on this topic in the following section.
The “App Internet” is another element in the future Web. The growth of apps 
within the mobile platform is astounding: Over 80% of mobile minutes in the 
United States are generated through apps, only 20% using browsers. Apps give 
users direct access to content and are much faster than loading a browser and 
searching for content.
The visual Web is another part of the future Web. The “visual Web” refers to Web 
sites like Pinterest where pictures replace text documents, where users search 
on  pictures, and where pictures of products replace display ads for  products. 
Pinterest is a social  networking site that provides users (as well as brands) with 
an online board to which they can “pin”  interesting pictures. Looking for a blue 
dress, or black dress shirt? Google will deliver  thousands of links to sites that 
sell these items. Pinterest will deliver a much smaller  collection of magazine 
quality photos linked subtly to vendor Web sites. Considered the fastest  growing 
Web site in history, Pinterest has 70 million monthly users and was the 35th 
most popular Web destination in 2014. The Instagram app is another example of 
the visual Web. Instagram is a photo and video  sharing site that allows users to 
take pictures, enhance them, and share them with friends on other social sites 
like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Google+. In 2014 Instagram had 220 million 
monthly active users. 
Other complementary trends leading toward a future Web 3.0 include more 
 widespread use of cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS) business 
models, ubiquitous  connectivity among mobile platforms and Internet access 
devices, and the transformation of the Web from a network of separate siloed 
applications and content into a more seamless and interoperable whole. These 
more  modest visions of the future Web 3.0 are more likely to be  realized in the 
near term.

WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL TECHNOLOGIES AND 
STANDARDS FOR WIRELESS NETWORKING, 
COMMUNICATION, AND INTERNET ACCESS?
Welcome to the wireless revolution! Cell phones, smartphones, tablets, and 
wireless-enabled  personal computers have morphed into portable media 
and computing platforms that let you perform many of the computing tasks 
you used to do at your desk, and a whole lot more. We introduced smart-
phones in our discussions of the mobile  digital platform in Chapters 1 and 5. 
Smartphones such as the iPhone, Android phones, and BlackBerry combine 
the functionality of a cell phone with that of a mobile laptop computer with 
Wi-Fi capability. This makes it possible to combine music, video, Internet 
318 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

access, and telephone service in one device. A large part of the Internet is 
becoming a mobile, access-anywhere, broadband service for the delivery of 
video, music, and Web search.
CELLULAR SYSTEMS
In 2013, over 1.8 billion cell phones were sold worldwide. In the United States, 
there are 365 million cell phone subscriptions, and 164 million people have 
smartphones. About 167 million people access the Web using their phone 
(eMarketer, 2014). In a few years, smartphones will be the predominant source 
of searches, not the desktop PC. Digital cellular service uses several compet-
ing standards. In Europe and much of the rest of the world outside the United 
Sates, the standard is Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). GSM’s 
strength is its international roaming capability. There are GSM cell phone 
 systems in the United States, including T-Mobile and AT&T. 
A competing standard in the United States is Code Division Multiple 
Access (CDMA), which is the system used by Verizon and Sprint. CDMA was 
 developed by the military  during World War II. It transmits over several fre-
quencies,  occupies the entire spectrum, and randomly assigns users to a range 
of  frequencies over time, making it more efficient than GSM.
Earlier generations of cellular systems were designed primarily for voice and 
limited data transmission in the form of short text messages. Today  wireless 
 carriers offer 3G and 4G networks. 3G networks, with transmission speeds rang-
ing from 144 Kbps for mobile users in, say, a car, to more than 2 Mbps for station-
ary users, offer fair transmission speeds for e-mail, browsing the Web, and online 
shopping, but are too slow for videos. 4G networks have much higher speeds: 
100 megabits/second download, and 50 megabits upload speed, with more than 
enough capacity for watching high definition video on your smartphone. Long 
Term Evolution (LTE) and mobile Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave 
Access (WiMax—see the following section) are the current 4G standards.
WIRELESS COMPUTER NETWORKS AND INTERNET 
ACCESS
An array of technologies provide high-speed wireless access to the Internet for 
PCs and mobile devices. These new high-speed services have extended Internet 
access to numerous locations that could not be covered by traditional wired 
Internet services, and have made ubiquitous computing, anywhere, anytime, 
a reality.
Bluetooth
Bluetooth is the popular name for the 802.15 wireless networking  standard, 
which is  useful for creating small personal area networks (PANs). It links 
up to eight devices within a 10-meter area using low-power, radio-based 
 communication and can transmit up to 722 Kbps in the 2.4-GHz band. 
Wireless phones, pagers, computers, printers, and computing devices using 
Bluetooth communicate with each other and even operate each other without 
direct user intervention (see Figure 7.13). For example, a person could direct a 
notebook computer to send a  document file wirelessly to a printer. Bluetooth 
 connects wireless keyboards and mice to PCs or cell phones to earpieces 
 without wires. Bluetooth has low power requirements,  making it appropriate 
for battery-powered handheld computers or cell phones.
 
Chapter 7 Telecommunications, the Internet, and Wireless Technology 
319

Although Bluetooth lends itself to personal networking, it has uses in 
large  corporations. For example, FedEx drivers use Bluetooth to trans-
mit the delivery data captured by their handheld PowerPad computers to 
 cellular transmitters, which forward the data to corporate computers. Drivers 
no longer need to spend time docking their handheld units physically in the 
transmitters, and Bluetooth has saved FedEx $20 million per year.
Wi-Fi and Wireless Internet Access
The 802.11 set of standards for wireless LANs and wireless Internet access is 
also known as Wi-Fi. The first of these standards to be widely adopted was 
802.11b, which can transmit up to 11 Mbps in the unlicensed 2.4-GHz band and 
has an effective distance of 30 to 50 meters. The 802.11g standard can transmit 
up to 54 Mbps in the 2.4-GHz range. 802.11n is capable of transmitting over 
100 Mbps. Today’s PCs and netbooks have built-in support for Wi-Fi, as do the 
iPhone, iPad, and other smartphones. 
In most Wi-Fi communication, wireless devices communicate with a wired 
LAN using access points. An access point is a box consisting of a radio receiver/
transmitter and  antennas that links to a wired network, router, or hub. Mobile 
access points such as Verizon’s Mobile Hotspots use the existing cellular 
 network to create Wi-Fi connections. 
Figure 7.14 illustrates an 802.11 wireless LAN that connects a small number 
of mobile devices to a larger wired LAN and to the Internet. Most wireless 
devices are client machines. The servers that the mobile client stations need 
to use are on the wired LAN. The access point controls the wireless stations 
and acts as a bridge between the main wired LAN and the wireless LAN. (A 
bridge connects two LANs based on different technologies.) The access point 
also  controls the wireless stations. 
 FIGURE 7.13 A BLUETOOTH NETWORK (PAN)
Bluetooth enables a variety of devices, including cell phones, smartphones, wireless keyboards and 
mice, PCs, and printers, to interact wirelessly with each other within a small 30-foot (10-meter) area. 
In addition to the links shown, Bluetooth can be used to network similar devices to send data from 
one PC to another, for example.
320 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

 FIGURE 7.14 AN 802.11 WIRELESS LAN
Mobile laptop computers equipped with network interface cards link to the wired LAN by 
 communicating with the access point. The access point uses radio waves to transmit network signals 
from the wired network to the client adapters, which convert them into data that the mobile device 
can understand. The client adapter then transmits the data from the mobile device back to the access 
point, which forwards the data to the wired network.
The most popular use for Wi-Fi today is for high-speed wireless Internet 
 service. In this instance, the access point plugs into an Internet connection, 
which could come from a cable service or DSL telephone service. Computers 
within range of the access point use it to link wirelessly to the Internet. 
Hotspots typically consist of one or more access points providing wireless 
Internet access in a public place. Some hotspots are free or do not require any 
additional software to use; others may require activation and the establishment 
of a user account by providing a credit card number over the Web. 
Businesses of all sizes are using Wi-Fi networks to provide low-cost  wireless 
LANs and Internet access. Wi-Fi hotspots can be found in hotels, airport lounges, 
libraries, cafes, and college campuses to provide mobile access to the Internet. 
Dartmouth College is one of many campuses where students now use Wi-Fi for 
research, course work, and entertainment. 
Wi-Fi technology poses several challenges, however. One is Wi-Fi’s  security 
features, which make these wireless networks vulnerable to intruders. We 
 provide more detail about Wi-Fi security issues in Chapter 8. 
Another drawback of Wi-Fi networks is susceptibility to interference from 
nearby  systems operating in the same spectrum, such as wireless phones, micro-
wave ovens, or other wireless LANs. However, wireless networks based on the 
802.11n standard are able to solve this problem by using multiple  wireless anten-
nas in tandem to transmit and receive data and technology called MIMO (mul-
tiple input multiple output) to coordinate multiple simultaneous radio  signals.
 
Chapter 7 Telecommunications, the Internet, and Wireless Technology 
321

WiMax
A surprisingly large number of areas in the United States and throughout the 
world do not have access to Wi-Fi or fixed broadband connectivity. The range of 
Wi-Fi systems is no more than 300 feet from the base station, making it difficult 
for rural groups that don’t have cable or DSL service to find wireless access to 
the Internet.
The IEEE developed a new family of standards known as WiMax to deal 
with these problems. WiMax, which stands for Worldwide Interoperability 
for Microwave Access, is the popular term for IEEE Standard 802.16. It has 
a  wireless access range of up to 31 miles and transmission speed of up to 75 
Mbps. 
WiMax antennas are powerful enough to beam high-speed Internet connec-
tions to  rooftop antennas of homes and businesses that are miles away. Cellular 
handsets and laptops with WiMax capabilities are appearing in the marketplace. 
Mobile WiMax is one of the  4G network technologies we discussed earlier in 
this chapter.
RFID AND WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS
Mobile technologies are creating new efficiencies and ways of working through-
out the enterprise. In addition to the wireless systems we have just described, 
radio frequency  identification systems and wireless sensor networks are having 
a major impact. 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
Radio frequency identification (RFID) systems provide a powerful technol-
ogy for  tracking the movement of goods throughout the supply chain. RFID 
 systems use tiny tags with embedded microchips containing data about an item 
and its location to transmit radio  signals over a short distance to RFID readers. 
The RFID readers then pass the data over a network to a computer for process-
ing. Unlike bar codes, RFID tags do not need line-of-sight contact to be read.
The RFID tag is electronically programmed with information that can 
uniquely identify an item plus other information about the item, such as 
its  location, where and when it was made, or its status during production. 
Embedded in the tag is a microchip for storing the data. The rest of the tag is an 
antenna that transmits data to the reader. 
The reader unit consists of an antenna and radio transmitter with a  decoding 
capability attached to a stationary or handheld device. The reader emits radio 
waves in ranges  anywhere from 1 inch to 100 feet, depending on its power 
 output, the radio frequency employed, and surrounding environmental 
 conditions. When a RFID tag comes within the range of the reader, the tag is 
 activated and starts sending data. The reader captures these data, decodes them, 
and sends them back over a wired or wireless network to a host  computer for 
further processing (see Figure 7.15). Both RFID tags and antennas come in a 
variety of shapes and sizes.
In inventory control and supply chain management, RFID systems  capture 
and  manage more detailed information about items in warehouses or in 
 production than bar coding  systems. If a large number of items are shipped 
together, RFID systems track each pallet, lot, or even unit item in the  shipment. 
This technology may help companies such as Walmart improve receiving and 
storage operations by improving their ability to “see” exactly what stock is 
stored in warehouses or on retail store shelves. Continental Tires, described 
322 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

 FIGURE 7.15 HOW RFID WORKS
RFID uses low-powered radio transmitters to read data stored in a tag at distances ranging from 1 inch to 100 feet. 
The reader captures the data from the tag and sends them over a network to a host computer for processing.
in the chapter-opening case, uses RFID technology to track materials, workers, 
and vehicles at its manufacturing facilities.
Walmart has installed RFID readers at store receiving docks to record 
the arrival of pallets and cases of goods shipped with RFID tags. The RFID 
reader reads the tags a second time just as the cases are brought onto the 
sales floor from backroom storage areas. Software combines sales data from 
Walmart’s point-of-sale systems and the RFID data regarding the number of 
cases brought out to the sales floor. The program determines which items will 
soon be depleted and automatically generates a list of items to pick in the 
 warehouse to replenish store shelves before they run out. This information 
helps Walmart reduce  out-of-stock items, increase sales, and further shrink 
its costs.
The cost of RFID tags used to be too high for widespread use, but now it starts 
at around 7 cents per tag in the United States. As the price decreases, RFID is 
starting to become  cost-effective for many applications. 
In addition to installing RFID readers and tagging systems, companies may 
need to upgrade their hardware and software to process the massive amounts 
of data produced by RFID systems—transactions that could add up to tens or 
hundreds of terabytes.
Software is used to filter, aggregate, and prevent RFID data from overload-
ing business networks and system applications. Applications often need to be 
 redesigned to accept large volumes of frequently generated RFID data and to 
share those data with other  applications. Major enterprise software vendors, 
including SAP and Oracle PeopleSoft, now offer  RFID-ready versions of their 
supply chain management applications.
Wireless Sensor Networks
If your company wanted state-of-the art technology to monitor building  security 
or detect hazardous substances in the air, it might deploy a wireless sensor 
network. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are networks of interconnected 
wireless devices that are embedded into the physical environment to provide 
 
Chapter 7 Telecommunications, the Internet, and Wireless Technology 
323

measurements of many points over large spaces. These devices have built-in 
processing, storage, and radio frequency sensors and antennas. They are linked 
into an interconnected network that routes the data they capture to a computer 
for analysis. 
These networks range from hundreds to thousands of nodes. Because  wireless 
 sensor devices are placed in the field for years at a time without any mainte-
nance or human  intervention, they must have very low power  requirements 
and batteries capable of lasting for years.
Figure 7.16 illustrates one type of wireless sensor network, with data from 
individual nodes flowing across the network to a server with greater processing 
power. The server acts as a gateway to a network based on Internet technology.
Wireless sensor networks are valuable in areas such as monitoring 
 environmental changes, monitoring traffic or military activity, protect-
ing  property,  efficiently operating and managing machinery and vehicles, 
 establishing  security perimeters, monitoring supply chain management, or 
detecting chemical, biological, or radiological material.
RFID systems and wireless sensor networks are major sources of “Big Data” 
that organizations are starting to analyze to improve their operations and deci-
sion making. Output from these systems is fueling what is called the Industrial 
Internet, also known as the Internet of Things, in which machines such as 
jet engines, power plant turbines, or agricultural sensors constantly gather data 
and send the data over the Internet for analysis. The data might signal the need 
to take action, such as replacing a part that’s close to wearing out, restocking 
a product on a store shelf, starting the watering system for a soybean field, or 
slowing down a turbine. Over time, more and more everyday physical objects 
will be connected to the Internet and will be able to identify themselves to other 
devices, creating networks that can sense and respond as data changes. Another 
example is the “smart city,” described in the Chapter 12 Interactive Session on 
Organizations. You’ll see more examples of the Internet of Things in Chapter 12.
 FIGURE 7.16 A WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK
The small circles represent lower-level nodes and the larger circles represent high-end nodes. 
 Lower-level nodes forward data to each other or to higher-level nodes, which transmit data more 
rapidly and speed up network performance.

Review Summary
1. What are the principal components of telecommunications networks and key  networking technologies?
A simple network consists of two or more connected  computers. Basic network components 
include computers, network interfaces, a connection medium, network operating system software, 
and either a hub or a switch. The networking infrastructure for a large company includes the 
 traditional telephone system, mobile  cellular communication, wireless local area networks, 
 videoconferencing systems, a corporate Web site, intranets, extranets, and an array of local and wide 
area  networks, including the Internet. 
Contemporary networks have been shaped by the rise of client/server computing, the use of packet 
switching, and the adoption of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) as a  universal 
communications standard for linking disparate networks and  computers, including the Internet. 
Protocols provide a common set of rules that enable  communication among diverse  components in a 
telecommunications network.
2. What are the different types of  networks?
The principal physical transmission media are twisted copper telephone wire, coaxial copper cable, 
fiber-optic cable, and wireless transmission.
Local area networks (LANs) connect PCs and other digital devices together within a 500-meter radius 
and are used today for many corporate computing tasks. Wide area  networks (WANs) span broad 
 geographical distances, ranging from several miles to  continents, and are often private networks that are 
independently managed. Metropolitan area networks (MANs) span a single urban area.
Digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies, cable Internet connections, and T1 lines are often used for 
high-capacity Internet connections. 
3. How do the Internet and Internet technology work, and how do they support  communication and 
e-business? 
The Internet is a worldwide network of networks that uses the client/server model of computing 
and the TCP/IP network reference model. Every computer on the Internet is assigned a unique 
numeric IP address. The Domain Name System (DNS) converts IP addresses to more user-friendly 
domain names. Worldwide Internet policies are established by organizations and government bodies, 
such as the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
Major Internet services include e-mail, newsgroups, chatting, instant messaging, Telnet, FTP, and 
the Web. Web pages are based on Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and can display text, graphics, 
video, and audio. Web site directories, search engines, and RSS  technology help users locate the 
 information they need on the Web. RSS, blogs, social  networking, and wikis are features of Web 2.0.
Firms are also starting to realize economies by using VoIP technology for voice  transmission and by 
using virtual private networks (VPNs) as low-cost alternatives to  private WANs.
4. What are the principal technologies and standards for wireless networking,  communication, and 
Internet access? 
Cellular networks are evolving toward  high-speed, high-bandwidth, digital packet-switched 
 transmission. Broadband 3G networks are capable of transmitting data at speeds ranging from 144 
Kbps to more than 2 Mbps. 4G networks capable of transmission speeds of 100 Mbps are starting to be 
rolled out.
Major cellular standards include Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), which is used primarily in 
the United States, and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), which is the standard in 
Europe and much of the rest of the world.
Standards for wireless computer networks include Bluetooth (802.15) for small personal area net-
works (PANs), Wi-Fi (802.11) for local area networks (LANs), and WiMax (802.16) for metropolitan area 
networks (MANs).
Radio frequency identification (RFID) systems provide a  powerful technology for tracking the 
 movement of goods by using tiny tags with embedded data about an item and its location. RFID  readers 
read the radio signals transmitted by these tags and pass the data over a network to a computer for 
 processing. Wireless  sensor networks (WSNs) are networks of interconnected wireless sensing and 
transmitting devices that are embedded into the physical environment to provide measurements of 
many points over large spaces.

RFID Propels the Angkasa Library Management System
CASE STUDY
R
FID (Radio-frequency Identification) can 
play a key role in library management. The 
major advantage of using RFID is that it 
ensures traceability and security. In addi-
tion, RFID simplifies transactional processes at the 
library and can help to cut costs and save time. Across 
the globe, libraries are setting up the infrastructure 
for RFID as a replacement for manual management 
or barcodes.  RFID tags can be embedded within a 
book, and unlike other forms of labeling, these tags 
can store additional information, like author and title.  
Using this system also speeds up the process of check-
ing books in and out, prevents theft and is of use in 
inventory management. The Allianze University 
College of Medical Sciences (AUCMS) has success-
fully set up RFID tagging as part of its library manage-
ment system. 
AUCMS is a premier institute offering courses in 
medicine and applied health sciences in Penang, 
Malaysia. The institution has a vast array of 
resources, including books, journals, newspapers, 
and e-books, and the library caters to a large popula-
tion of students and staff. AUCMS partnered with 
the Sains Group, which is a globally renowned soft-
ware solutions and IT services provider, to install 
and implement the the company’s Angkasa Library 
Management system. This system manages many of 
the core functions of the library, including acquisi-
tion, cataloguing, circulation, subscriptions to jour-
nals, and the management of an open-access cata-
logue available to members on the Web. 
The system is primarily useful in terms of being 
a repository of all library records. It enables the 
automatization of library processes that would earlier 
have been manual and paper-based. The Acquisition 
Module manages the process of acquiring the books, 
magazines, journals and other materials for the 
library. This automates the entire process of acquisi-
tion, from the approval of orders to placing them, the 
recording of receipts and invoices, and even man-
ages expenditure and maintains budgets. In a typical 
instance, lists of required reading material are sent 
over to the library heads, a final list is determined, 
all of the important information is recorded on the 
system  (invoice numbers, supplier names, and so 
on). The system provides a printable order form, 
which is then signed off on by the library head and 
sent to suppliers. 
Information on newly acquired books is entered 
into the system through the Cataloguing Module, 
which assigns classification numbers to each book. 
Data is entered in the standard machine-readable 
format AACR2, which stands for Anglo-American 
Cataloguing Rules. Based on this standard format, 
the technical department enters details into the sys-
tem, which then generates an index card in the same 
format. This card serves as an index for searching, 
and makes import/export of bibliographic data in 
standard exchange formats possible. The Circulation 
Module performs all the functions related to circula-
tion, providing suitable checks at every stage. Since 
books may be circulated for multiple reasons such as 
book binding and display, in addition to being issued 
to members, this module records the current status 
of a circulated library item. The Serials Management 
Module controls the library’s subscriptions to periodi-
cals and monitors the scheduled arrival of individual 
issues, in addition to recording budget information. 
An important part of the library management sys-
tem is the Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC), 
which provides online access to library resources. 
The OPAC module supports keyword searches 
in many languages, and page navigation is user-
friendly. Since the catalogue is Web-enabled, this 
makes it very easy to keep information on the avail-
ability of materials in the library up-to-date. Another 
member-centric module is the Member Management 
module, which stores profiles for all library members 
and includes a photograph and a registration num-
ber. This module sends reminders to members to 
return their books on time, and also records fines if 
items are not returned.
The first step towards setting this comprehensive 
system up at the AUCMS library was the tagging of 
the books. The RFID tag is the most important aspect 
of the system because the tag establishes a unique 
identitity for each library asset, from books to maga-
zines, and functions as the item’s identity in the 
system. The tag contains electronically stored infor-
mation that may be read from up to several meters. 
Unlike a bar code, the RFID tag does not need to be 
in the line of sight of a barcode reader. All library 
issuing and returns counters have a touch screen 
with an RFID glass sensor. A handheld reader is also 
required to scan membership cards. 
 
Chapter 7 Telecommunications, the Internet, and Wireless Technology 
329

Borrowers simply place books and other material 
they want to borrow on the touch screen, and hand 
over their cards to library staff. The screen reads 
RFID tags, while the card reader opens up a mem-
ber’s profile on the system. The staff member assigns 
material to the borrower in question, and an issuing 
receipt is generated, with the date of return clearly 
marked. This system eliminates the need for physi-
cal records, stamping, and other time-consuming 
activities involved in the process of checking a book 
out of a library. In addition, the system also mini-
mizes human error. 
Returning books is also much easier now, with 
members simply dropping their books at any time 
into a specially designed “drop box” machine in the 
library. Members drop the books to be returned in 
the box one at a time. A scanner within the drop box 
scans the RFID tag of the dropped book and marks 
it as returned in the system. Member accounts are 
updated accordingly and a proof-of-return slip is 
issued automatically. The whole process is accom-
plished through a link between the RFID system 
and the library’s host computer. This eliminates the 
need for staff who would earlier have had to process 
all book returns, and is also convenient for mem-
bers, since they can return their books even when 
the library is closed. The status of returned items 
is updated instantly, which means other members 
who are waiting for a particular item can acquire it 
at once.
Another major task that has always occupied 
library staff is shelf management. Since a large 
number of users access the library and do not put 
books back on shelves in the right order, shelves can 
become difficult to manage. Books that have been 
returned also have to be returned to specific shelves. 
The shelf management system in place at the 
AUCMS library consists of a portable scanner and a 
base station. The solution is designed to cover three 
main operations: searching for individual books, 
inventory checks of library stock, and locating and 
replacing for books that have been shelved incor-
rectly. Each book has a shelf ID, which is the loca-
tion identification code (this code enables 
section-wise and rack-wise identification of books). 
This information is saved in a central database 
against the book’s information and RFID tag, as 
well as being linked to OPAC. The portable scan-
ner fetches the information stored in a book’s RFID 
tag, and using the shelving information also stored 
in the database, library staff can move books back 
into their places. Similarly, missing books can also 
be identified, with the portable scanner pulling up 
the records of all the books meant to be on a specific 
shelf. The collected information is compared against 
the library database to generate a report of miss-
ing books. This system has improved accuracy and 
enabled faster shelving (20 books per minute). It also 
directs OPAC users to the exact physical locations of 
the books they are looking for. In total, the automa-
tization of all of these library processes has resulted 
in a significant decrease in the amount of manpower 
required to staff the library. 
Finally, one of the most pervasive problems in 
any library is theft. RFID tagging is extremely use-
ful in preventing theft through the installation of 
Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) gates in librar-
ies. Just like alarm systems in stores, a library mem-
ber attempting to leave with an unissued item would 
trigger an alarm, because the gates can sense the 
book’s RFID tag within a range of 1 meter without 
interference of magnetic items. The EAS gates are 
linked to the library’s surveillance station. When 
someone passes through with an unissued item, an 
alarm is sounded and the gates are raised, an alarm 
is sounded, and the camera at the gates takes a pho-
tograph of the person and sends it to the surveillance 
station. Theft detection is a stand-alone technology 
that operates independently of the library database, 
but it is an integral part of managing the library at 
AUCMS.

hen over 20 European countries, including Ukraine, Belgium, 
Portugal, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Ireland were infected 
with an unusual malware agent that combined malware writing 
techniques from the turn of the century with novel, new sandbox-
evading techniques, security experts at Kaspersky Lab and CrySys Lab sounded 
the alarm. Dubbed MiniDuke, the social engineering exploit gained initial 
access by inducing targets to open infected PDF attachments that appeared 
legitimate and highly relevant to the recipient’s work. 
Sandboxing was developed as an alternative to traditional signature-based 
virus detection to find zero-day malware—unknown malware for which antivi-
rus software signatures are not yet available. MiniDuke used a now patched 
Adobe Reader bug to avoid the sandbox, allowing it to install a dropper (small 
downloader) that provided the perpetrators with a customized backdoor 
unique to each system. Normal authentication procedures could then be 
bypassed and affected machines remotely accessed. What’s more, the com-
puter’s unique fingerprint was then also used to encrypt communications 
back to the attackers. In hostile environments, MiniDuke goes dormant rather 
than proceeding to its next step—using Twitter to locate specific tweets from 
premade accounts created by its Command and Control (C2) operators. These 
tweets contain tags that identify encrypted URLs for the C2s. The C2s in turn 
transmit encrypted files containing commands and infected GIF files to create 
a bigger backdoor on the system. In the absence of Twitter, MiniDuke can use 
Google Search to locate the C2s. 
‘MINIDUKE’ EXPOSES EU CYBERSECURITY GAPS

With geopolitical intelligence as the goal, victims of the February 2013 attacks 
included a research institute, two think tanks, a prominent research founda-
tion, and multiple government entities and institutions. But even though secu-
rity researchers identified one command server in Panama and another in 
Turkey, the perpetrators, and the precise information they were seeking, 
remained unknown. 
As 2013 continued, attacks on European government agencies became a 
recurring theme. In July, Trend Micro discovered that members of the diplo-
matic community in 16 European and several Asian countries had been tar-
geted with malware-laden e-mail attachments suspected to have originated 
from China’s defense ministry. Like MiniDuke, the malware exploited a vulner-
ability in widely-used business software (Microsoft Office 2003-2010), installed 
a dropper, and created a backdoor. It then collected e-mail user names and pass-
words from Outlook and Internet Explorer along with Web site login credentials 
and transmitted the data to two now-defunct URLs in Hong Kong. Throughout 
2014, MiniDuke continued to exert influence, as law enforcement agencies 
reported its usage in attacks against governments and other organizations.
With the sophistication, efficacy, frequency, and geopolitical consequences 
of cyberattacks on the rise, ENISA, the European Union Agency for Network 
and Information Security, established in 2005, urged implementation of a com-
mon cybersecurity strategy. However, the fledgling European Cybercrime 
Centre (EC3) created in January 2013 was not even able to stipulate a clear 
definition for cyber security, let alone induce members to craft and implement 
coordinated policies. In July, its cybersecurity strategy presentation to the 
European Parliament merely defined the role of governments in combatting 
cybercrime, bolstering national defense, and effecting international coopera-
tion along with setting general guidelines for fundamental rights, responsibili-
ties, and access.
The 28 members are simply not willing to cede any part of their national 
security policy to the EU, and the EC3 did not challenge this entrenched out-
look. Lack of a centralized and cohesive approach to cybersecurity makes for 
disjointed and disparate policies and procedures and unequal levels of protec-
tion. While members whose economies depend on information and communi-
cations technology (ICT) stayed abreast of cybersecurity threats and defenses, 
others have not yet implemented the most basic protections. As MiniDuke 
demonstrated, having 28 different approaches to cybersecurity leaves all mem-
bers vulnerable to national security breaches.

WHY ARE INFORMATION SYSTEMS VULNERABLE 
TO DESTRUCTION, ERROR, AND ABUSE?
C
an you imagine what would happen if you tried to link to the Internet 
 without a firewall or antivirus software? Your computer would be 
 disabled in a few  seconds, and it might take you many days to recover. 
If you used the  computer to run your business, you might not be 
able to sell to your customers or place orders with your suppliers while it was 
down. And you might find that your  computer system had been penetrated by 
 outsiders, who perhaps stole or destroyed valuable data, including confiden-
tial payment data from your customers. If too much data were destroyed or 
divulged, your business might never be able to recover!
The problems created by malware such as MiniDuke and DDoS attacks illustrate 
why the EU and businesses operating there need to pay special attention to infor-
mation system security. The fragmented approach to cybersecurity in the EU 
does not allocate responsibility among the stakeholders, and with no cohesive 
strategy, members are not encouraged to work together. Neither governments 
nor businesses are adequately protected.
In November 2013, ENISA, recognizing the switch to cloud computing, urged adop-
tion of a unified strategy for public sector cloud security. Standard procedures for 
security certification of both services and providers, a shared framework for service-
level agreements (SLAs), and a common certification and accreditation process were 
recommended as well as cloud deployment security measures to protect the integrity 
of the cloud supply chain. 
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by this 
case and this chapter. While Web servers can never be completely secure from hack-
ers who can steal sensitive public and private sector data, the EU must clearly do 
more to protect its member nations and the businesses that serve its citizens. While 
establishment of the EC3 was a start, member nations must be convinced to partici-
pate in a consistent, common cybersecurity strategy.  This strategy must include the 
expert knowledge collected by private sector security companies such as Kaspersky 
Lab McAfee, CrySys Lab, Trend Micro and others as well as input from large busi-
ness entities which are at the greatest risk due to the greater sensitivity and value 
of their stored data.
 
Chapter 8 Securing Information Systems 
337

In short, if you operate a business today, you need to make security 
and  control a top priority. Security refers to the policies, procedures, and 
 technical  measures used to  prevent unauthorized access, alteration, theft, 
or  physical damage to information systems. Controls are methods, policies, 
and  organizational procedures that ensure the safety of the  organization’s 
assets, the  accuracy and reliability of its records, and operational adherence to 
 management standards.
WHY SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE
When large amounts of data are stored in electronic form, they are vulnera-
ble to many more kinds of threats than when they existed in manual form. 
Through communications networks, information systems in different  locations 
are  interconnected. The potential for  unauthorized access, abuse, or fraud 
is not limited to a single location but can occur at any access point in the 
 network. Figure 8.1 illustrates the most common threats against contempo-
rary  information  systems. They can stem from technical, organizational, and 
 environmental  factors compounded by poor management decisions. In the 
multi-tier  client/server computing environment illustrated here, vulnerabili-
ties exist at each layer and in the communications between the layers. Users at 
the client layer can cause harm by  introducing errors or by accessing systems 
without  authorization. It is possible to access data flowing over networks, steal 
valuable data during transmission, or alter messages without  authorization. 
Radiation may disrupt a network at various points as well. Intruders can launch 
denial-of-service attacks or malicious software to disrupt the operation of Web 
sites. Those capable of penetrating corporate systems can steal, destroy, or 
alter corporate data stored in databases or files.
Systems malfunction if computer hardware breaks down, is not configured 
properly, or is damaged by improper use or criminal acts. Errors in program-
ming, improper installation, or unauthorized changes cause computer software 
 FIGURE 8.1 
 CONTEMPORARY SECURITY CHALLENGES AND 
VULNERABILITIES
The architecture of a Web-based application typically includes a Web client, a server, and corporate 
information systems linked to databases. Each of these components presents security challenges and 
vulnerabilities. Floods, fires, power failures, and other electrical problems can cause disruptions at any 
point in the network.
338 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

to fail. Power failures, floods, fires, or other natural disasters can also disrupt 
computer systems.
Domestic or offshore partnering with another company adds to system 
 vulnerability if valuable information resides on networks and computers 
 outside the organization’s  control. Without strong safeguards, valuable data 
could be lost, destroyed, or could fall into the wrong hands, revealing important 
trade secrets or information that violates  personal  privacy.
The popularity of handheld mobile devices for business computing adds to 
these woes. Portability makes cell phones, smartphones, and tablet comput-
ers easy to lose or steal. Smartphones share the same security weaknesses as 
other Internet devices, and are  vulnerable to malicious software and penetra-
tion from outsiders. Smartphones used by  corporate employees often contain 
 sensitive data such as sales figures, customer names, phone numbers, and 
e-mail addresses. Intruders may be able to access internal corporate systems 
through these devices.
Internet Vulnerabilities
Large public networks, such as the Internet, are more vulnerable than internal 
networks because they are virtually open to anyone. The Internet is so huge 
that when abuses do occur, they can have an enormously widespread impact. 
When the Internet becomes part of the corporate network, the organization’s 
information systems are even more vulnerable to actions from outsiders.
Telephone service based on Internet technology (see Chapter 7) is more 
 vulnerable than the switched voice network if it does not run over a secure 
private network. Most Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic over the public Internet is not 
encrypted, so anyone with a network can listen in on conversations. Hackers 
can intercept conversations or shut down voice service by flooding servers 
 supporting VoIP with bogus traffic.
Vulnerability has also increased from widespread use of e-mail, instant 
 messaging (IM), and peer-to-peer file-sharing programs. E-mail may contain 
attachments that serve as springboards for malicious software or unauthor-
ized access to internal corporate systems. Employees may use e-mail  messages 
to transmit valuable trade secrets, financial data, or confidential customer 
 information to unauthorized recipients. Popular IM applications for  consumers 
do not use a secure layer for text messages, so they can be intercepted and read 
by outsiders during transmission over the public Internet. Instant  messaging 
activity over the Internet can in some cases be used as a back door to an 
 otherwise secure network. Sharing files over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, such 
as those for illegal music sharing, may also transmit malicious software or 
expose information on either individual or corporate computers to outsiders.
Wireless Security Challenges
Is it safe to log onto a wireless network at an airport, library, or other public 
 location? It depends on how vigilant you are. Even the wireless network in 
your home is vulnerable because radio frequency bands are easy to scan. Both 
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks are susceptible to hacking by eavesdroppers. Local 
area  networks (LANs) using the 802.11 standard can be easily  penetrated by 
 outsiders armed with laptops, wireless cards, external antennae, and  hacking soft-
ware. Hackers use these tools to detect unprotected networks, monitor  network 
traffic, and, in some cases, gain access to the Internet or to corporate  networks.
Wi-Fi transmission technology was designed to make it easy for stations 
to find and hear one another. The service set identifiers (SSIDs) that identify 
the access points in a Wi-Fi network are broadcast multiple times and can be 
 
Chapter 8 Securing Information Systems 
339

picked up fairly easily by intruders’ sniffer programs (see Figure 8.2). Wireless 
 networks in many locations do not have basic  protections against war driving, 
in which eavesdroppers drive by buildings or park outside and try to intercept 
wireless network traffic.
An intruder that has associated with an access point by using the correct 
SSID is  capable of accessing other resources on the network. For example, the 
intruder could use the Windows operating system to  determine which other 
users are connected to the network, access their  computer hard drives, and 
open or copy their files.
Intruders also use the information they have gleaned to set up rogue access 
points on a different radio channel in physical locations close to users to force 
a user’s radio  network interface controller (NIC) to associate with the rogue 
access point. Once this association occurs, hackers using the rogue access point 
can capture the names and  passwords of  unsuspecting users.
MALICIOUS SOFTWARE: VIRUSES, WORMS, TROJAN 
HORSES, AND SPYWARE
Malicious software programs are referred to as malware and include a  variety 
of threats, such as computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. A computer 
virus is a rogue  software program that attaches itself to other software  programs 
or data files in order to be  executed, usually without user  knowledge or permis-
sion. Most computer viruses deliver a “payload.” The payload may be relatively 
 FIGURE 8.2 
 WI-FI SECURITY CHALLENGES
Many Wi-Fi networks can be penetrated easily by intruders using sniffer programs to obtain an 
address to access the resources of a network without authorization.
340 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

benign, such as instructions to display a  message or image, or it may be highly 
destructive—destroying programs or data,  clogging  computer  memory, refor-
matting a computer’s hard drive, or causing programs to run improperly. 
Viruses  typically spread from computer to computer when humans take an 
action, such as sending an e-mail  attachment or copying an infected file.
Most recent attacks have come from worms, which are independent  computer 
programs that copy themselves from one computer to other  computers over a 
network. Unlike viruses, worms can operate on their own without attaching 
to other computer program files and rely less on human behavior in order to 
spread from computer to computer. This explains why computer worms spread 
much more rapidly than computer viruses. Worms destroy data and programs 
as well as disrupt or even halt the operation of  computer  networks.
Worms and viruses are often spread over the Internet from files of  downloaded 
 software, from files attached to e-mail transmissions, or from  compromised 
e-mail  messages, online ads, or instant messaging. Viruses have also invaded 
computerized information  systems from “infected” disks or infected machines. 
Especially prevalent today are drive-by downloads,  consisting of malware 
that comes with a downloaded file that a user  intentionally or unintentionally 
requests.
Hackers can do to a smartphone just about anything they can do to any 
Internet device: request malicious files without user intervention, delete files, 
transmit files, install  programs running in the background to monitor user 
actions, and potentially  convert the smartphone into a robot in a botnet to send 
e-mail and text messages to anyone. With smartphones starting to outsell PCs, 
and smartphones increasingly used as payment devices, they are becoming a 
major avenue for malware.
According to McAfee and other IT security experts, mobile devices now pose 
the greatest security risks, outpacing those from larger computers. Android, 
which is the world’s leading mobile operating system, not Windows, is the 
 platform targeted by most hackers. (McAfee, 2014; Reisinger, 2014). Mobile 
device viruses pose  serious threats to enterprise computing because so many 
wireless devices are now linked to corporate  information systems, as the trend 
towards employees using their own devices for work continues.
Blogs, wikis, and social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and 
LinkedIn have emerged as new conduits for malware or spyware. These appli-
cations allow users to post software code as part of the permissible content, and 
such code can be launched  automatically as soon as a Web page is viewed. In 
the spring of 2014, some programs purporting to be Instagram “image  viewers,” 
or “image and video downloaders” to transfer Instagram photos to desktop PCs 
were bundled with malware. The malware caused Internet slowdown, unwanted 
redirection to other sites, and sometimes installation of other  programs without 
the user’s consent (Scharr, 2014).
Panda Security reported that in 2013, there were 30 million new malware 
strains in circulation, averaging 82,000 per day. Additionally 20 percent of all 
malware that has ever existed was created in that one year alone (Panda, 2014). 
Table 8.1 describes the characteristics of some of the most harmful worms and 
viruses that have appeared to date.
Over 70 percent of the infections Panda found were Trojan Horses. A Trojan 
horse is a software program that appears to be benign but then does something 
other than expected. The Trojan horse is not itself a virus because it does not 
replicate, but it is often a way for viruses or other malicious code to be intro-
duced into a computer  system. The term Trojan horse is based on the huge 
wooden horse used by the Greeks to trick the Trojans into  opening the gates 
 
Chapter 8 Securing Information Systems 
341

to their fortified city during the Trojan War. Once inside the city walls, Greek 
 soldiers hidden in the horse revealed themselves and  captured the city.
An example of a modern-day Trojan horse is the Zeus Trojan which runs 
on computers with the Microsoft Windows operating system. It is often used 
to steal login credentials for banking by surreptitiously capturing peoples’ 
 keystrokes as they use their computers. Zeus is spread mainly through drive-by 
downloads and phishing.
SQL injection attacks have become a major malware threat. SQL  injection 
attacks take advantage of vulnerabilities in poorly coded Web application 
 software to  introduce  malicious program code into a company’s systems and 
networks. These  vulnerabilities occur when a Web application fails to  properly 
validate or filter data entered by a user on a Web page, which might occur when 
ordering something online. An attacker uses this input validation error to send 
a rogue SQL query to the underlying database to access the  database, plant 
malicious code, or access other systems on the network. Large Web applica-
tions have hundreds of places for inputting user data, each of which creates an 
opportunity for an SQL injection attack.
Malware known as ransomware is proliferating on both desktop and mobile 
devices. Ransomware tries to extort money from users by taking control of

their computers or displaying annoying pop-up messages. One nasty  example, 
CryptoLocker, encrypts an infected computer’s files, forcing users to pay 
 hundreds of dollars to regain access. You can get ransomware from donwload-
ing an infected attachment, clicking a link inside an email or by visiting the 
wrong Web site. 
Some types of spyware also act as malicious software. These small  programs 
install themselves surreptitiously on computers to monitor user Web surfing 
activity and serve up advertising. Thousands of forms of spyware have been 
documented.
Many users find such spyware annoying, and some critics worry about its 
infringement on computer users’ privacy. Some forms of spyware are  especially 
nefarious. Keyloggers record every keystroke made on a computer to steal 
serial numbers for software, to launch Internet attacks, to gain access to e-mail 
accounts, to obtain passwords to protected  computer systems, or to pick up 
 personal information such as credit card and or bank account numbers. The 
Zeus Trojan described earlier uses keylogging. Other spyware programs reset 
Web browser home pages, redirect search requests, or slow performance by 
taking up too much memory.
HACKERS AND COMPUTER CRIME
A hacker is an individual who intends to gain unauthorized access to a 
 computer  system. Within the hacking community, the term cracker is  typically 
used to denote a hacker with criminal intent, although in the public press, 
the terms hacker and cracker are used  interchangeably. Hackers and  crackers 
gain  unauthorized access by finding weaknesses in the security protections 
employed by Web sites and computer systems, often taking  advantage of  various 
features of the Internet that make it an open system and easy to use. 
Hacker activities have broadened beyond mere system intrusion to include 
theft of goods and information, as well as system damage and  cybervandalism, 
the intentional  disruption, defacement, or even destruction of a Web site or 
 corporate information system. For  example, a group of pro-Syrian regime  hackers 
called the Syrian Electronic Army hacked Skype’s Twitter account, blog, and 
Facebook page in early January 2014, publishing a fake message which read, 
“Don’t use Microsoft emails...They are monitoring your accounts and selling the 
data to the governments” (Ribeiro, 2014).
Spoofing and Sniffing
Hackers attempting to hide their true identities often spoof, or misrepresent, 
themselves by using fake e-mail addresses or masquerading as someone else. 
Spoofing may also involve redirecting a Web link to an address different from 
the intended one, with the site  masquerading as the intended destination. For 
example, if hackers redirect customers to a fake Web site that looks almost 
exactly like the true site, they can then collect and  process orders,  effectively 
stealing  business as well as sensitive customer information from the true site. 
We will provide more detail on other forms of spoofing in our discussion of 
 computer crime.
A sniffer is a type of eavesdropping program that monitors informa-
tion  traveling over a network. When used legitimately, sniffers help identify 
 potential network trouble spots or criminal activity on networks, but when 
used for criminal purposes, they can be  damaging and very difficult to detect. 
Sniffers enable hackers to steal proprietary information from  anywhere on a 
network, including e-mail messages, company files, and  confidential reports.
 
Chapter 8 Securing Information Systems 
343

Denial-of-Service Attacks
In a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, hackers flood a network server or Web 
server with many thousands of false communications or requests for services 
to crash the network. The network receives so many queries that it cannot 
keep up with them and is thus unavailable to service legitimate requests. A 
 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack uses numerous computers to 
inundate and overwhelm the network from numerous launch points. 
Although DoS attacks do not destroy information or access restricted areas 
of a  company’s information systems, they often cause a Web site to shut down, 
making it  impossible for legitimate users to access the site. For example, the 
blogging service Typepad was subjected to a series of DDoS attacks in April 
2014 which lasted five days. During that time period, the site was flooded with 
so much illicit traffic that it was knocked offline, preventing Typepad users 
from acessing their blogs and applications (Perez, 2014). For busy  e-commerce 
sites, these attacks are costly; while the site is shut down,  customers cannot 
make purchases. Especially vulnerable are small and midsize businesses whose 
networks tend to be less protected than those of large corporations.
Perpetrators of DDoS attacks often use thousands of “zombie” PCs infected 
with  malicious software without their owners’ knowledge and organized into 
a botnet. Hackers create these botnets by infecting other people’s computers 
with bot malware that opens a back door through which an attacker can give 
instructions. The infected computer then becomes a slave, or zombie, serving 
a master computer belonging to someone else. Once hackers infect enough 
computers, they can use the amassed resources of the botnet to launch DDoS 
attacks, phishing campaigns, or unsolicited “spam” e-mail.
Ninety percent of the world’s spam and 80 percent of the world’s malware are 
 delivered via botnets. For example, the Grum botnet, once the world’s third-largest 
botnet, was reportedly responsible for 18% of worldwide spam traffic (amounting 
to 18 billion spam messages per day) when it was shut down on July 19, 2012. At 
one point Grum had infected and  controlled 560,000–840,000 computers.
Computer Crime
Most hacker activities are criminal offenses, and the vulnerabilities of systems 
we have just described make them targets for other types of computer crime 
as well. Computer crime is defined by the U.S. Department of Justice as “any 
violations of criminal law that involve a  knowledge of computer technology for 
their perpetration, investigation, or prosecution.” Table 8.2 provides examples 
of the computer as both a  target and an instrument of crime. 
No one knows the magnitude of the computer crime problem—how many 
 systems are invaded, how many people engage in the practice, or the total 
 economic  damage. According to the Ponemon Institute’s 2013 Annual Cost of 
Cyber Crime Study  sponsored by HP Enterprise Security, the average annual-
ized cost of cybercrime for the organizations in the study was $11.6 million 
per year (Ponemon Institute, 2013). Many companies are  reluctant to report 
 computer crimes because the crimes may involve employees, or the  company 
fears that publicizing its vulnerability will hurt its reputation. The most 
 economically  damaging kinds of computer crime are denial of service attacks, 
activities of malicious insiders, and Web-based attacks.
Identity Theft
With the growth of the Internet and electronic commerce, identity theft has 
become  especially troubling. Identity theft is a crime in which an imposter 
344 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

obtains key pieces of personal information, such as social security identifica-
tion numbers, driver’s license  numbers, or credit card numbers, to impersonate 
someone else. The information may be used to obtain credit, merchandise, or 
services in the name of the victim or to provide the thief with false credentials. 
Identity theft has flourished on the Internet, with credit card files a major 
target of Web site hackers. According to the Identity Fraud Study by Javelin 
Strategy & Research, identity fraud affected 13.1 million consumers in 2013. 
The total dolllar losses from identity theft increased to $18 billion (Javelin 
2014). Moreover, e-commerce sites are wonderful sources of customer 
 personal  information—name, address, and phone number. Armed with this 
 information, criminals are able to assume new identities and establish new 
credit for their own purposes. 
One increasingly popular tactic is a form of spoofing called phishing. 
Phishing involves setting up fake Web sites or sending e-mail messages that 
look like those of legitimate  businesses to ask users for confidential personal 
data. The e-mail message instructs recipients to update or confirm records 
by providing social security numbers, bank and credit card information, and 
other confidential data either by responding to the e-mail message, by  entering 
the information at a bogus Web site, or by calling a telephone number. EBay, 
PayPal, Amazon.com, Walmart, and a variety of banks are among the top 
spoofed  companies. In a more targeted form of phishing called spear phishing, 
messages appear to come from a trusted source, such as an individual within 
the recipient’s own company or a friend. 
Phishing techniques called evil twins and pharming are harder to detect. Evil 
twins are wireless networks that pretend to offer trustworthy Wi-Fi  connections 
to the Internet, such as those in airport lounges, hotels, or coffee shops. The 
bogus network looks identical to a legitimate public network. Fraudsters try to 
capture passwords or credit card numbers of unwitting users who log on to the 
network.

Pharming redirects users to a bogus Web page, even when the individual 
types the  correct Web page address into his or her browser. This is possible if 
pharming perpetrators gain access to the Internet address information stored 
by Internet service providers to speed up Web browsing and the ISP companies 
have flawed software on their servers that allows the fraudsters to hack in and 
change those addresses.
According to the Ponemon Institute’s 2014 Cost of a Data Breach Study, 
the average cost of a breach to a company was $3.5 million (Ponemon, 2014). 
Moreover, brand damage can be significant, albeit hard to quantify. Table 8.3 
describes other major data breaches.
The U.S. Congress addressed the threat of computer crime in 1986 with the 
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes it illegal to access a computer 
system without authorization. Most states have similar laws, and nations in 
Europe have comparable legislation. Congress passed the National Information 
Infrastructure Protection Act in 1996 to make malware distribution and hacker 
attacks to disable Web sites federal crimes.
U.S. legislation, such as the Wiretap Act, Wire Fraud Act, Economic Espionage 
Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, E-Mail Threats and Harassment 
Act, and Child Pornography Act, covers computer crimes involving intercept-
ing electronic communication, using electronic communication to defraud, 
 stealing trade secrets, illegally accessing stored electronic communications, 
using e-mail for threats or harassment, and transmitting or  possessing child 
pornography. A proposed federal Data Security and Breach Notification Act 
would mandate organizations that possess personal information to put in place 
“reasonable”  security procedures to keep the data secure and to notify anyone 
affected by a data breach, but it has not been enacted.
TABLE 8.3 MAJOR DATA BREACHES
DATA BREACH
DESCRIPTION
EBay
Cyberattack on eBay servers during February and March 2014 compromises database containing 
customer names, encrypted passwords, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and 
birthdates. No financial data were accessed, but the information is useful for identity theft.
Heartland Payment Systems
In 2008, criminals led by Miami hacker Albert Gonzales installed spying software on the computer 
network of Heartland Payment Systems, a payment processor based in Princeton, NJ, and stole the 
numbers of as many as 100 million credit and debit cards. Gonzales was sentenced in 2010 to 20 
years in federal prison, and Heartland paid about $140 million in fines and settlements.
TJX
A 2007 data breach at TJX, the retailer that owns national chains including TJ Maxx and Marshalls, 
cost at least $250 million. Cyber criminals took more than 45 million credit and debit card numbers, 
some of which were used later to buy millions of dollars in electronics from Walmart and elsewhere. 
Albert Gonzales, who played a major role in the Heartland hack, was linked to this cyberattack as 
well.
Epsilon
In March 2011, hackers stole millions of names and e-mail addresses from the Epsilon e-mail 
marketing firm, which handles e-mail lists for major retailers and banks like Best Buy, JPMorgan, TiVo, 
and Walgreens. Costs could range from $100 million to $4 billion, depending on what happens to the 
stolen data, with most of the costs from losing customers due to a damaged reputation.
Sony
In April 2011, hackers obtained personal information, including credit, debit, and bank account 
numbers, from over 100 million PlayStation Network users and Sony Online Entertainment users. The 
breach could cost Sony and credit card issuers up to a total of $2 billion.

STUXNET AND THE CHANGING FACE OF CYBERWARFARE 
In July 2010, reports surfaced about a Stuxnet worm 
that had been targeting Iran’s nuclear facilities. In 
November of that year, Iran’s President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad publicly acknowledged that malicious 
software had infected the Iranian nuclear facilities 
and disrupted the nuclear program by disabling the 
facilities’ centrifuges. Stuxnet had earned its place 
in history as the first visible example of industrial 
cyberwarfare.
To date, Stuxnet is the most sophisticated 
 cyberweapon ever deployed. Stuxnet’s mission was 
to activate only computers that ran Supervisory 
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software 
used in Siemens centrifuges to enrich uranium. The 
Windows-based worm had a “dual warhead.” One 
part was designed to lay dormant for long periods, 
then speed up Iran’s nuclear centrifuges so that they 
spun wildly out of control. Another secretly recorded 
what normal operations at the nuclear plant looked 
like and then played those recordings back to plant 
operators so it would appear that the centrifuges 
were operating normally when they were actually 
tearing themselves apart. 
The worm’s sophistication indicated the work 
of highly skilled professionals. Michael Assante, 
 president and CEO at the National Board of 
Information Security Examiners, views Stuxnet as a 
weapons delivery system like the B-2 Bomber. The 
software program code was highly modular, so that it 
could be easily changed to attack different systems. 
Stuxnet only became active when it encountered a 
specific configuration of controllers, running a set of 
processes limited to centrifuge plants.
Over 60 percent of Stuxet-infected computers are 
in Iran, and digital security company Kaspersky Labs 
speculates that the worm was launched with nation-
state support (probably from Israel and the United 
States) with the intention of disabling some or all of 
Iran’s uranium enrichment program. Stuxnet wiped 
out about one-fifth of Iran’s nuclear centrifuges by 
causing them to spin at too high a velocity. The dam-
age was irreparable and is believed to have delayed 
Iran’s ability to make nuclear arms by as much as 
five years. And no one is certain that the Stuxnet 
attacks are over. Some experts who examined the 
Stuxnet software code believe it contains the seeds 
for more versions and attacks. 
According to a Tofino Security report, Stuxnet is 
capable of infecting even well-secured computer sys-
tems that follow industry best practices. Companies’ 
need for interonnectivity between control systems 
make it nearly impossible to defend against a well-
constructed, multi-pronged attack such as Stuxnet. 
And Stuxnet is not the only cyberweapon cur-
rently at work. The Flame virus, released about 
five years ago, has been infecting computers in 
Iran, Lebanon, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, 
and Israel. While researchers are still analyzing the 
program, the attack’s main goal is stealing informa-
tion and espionage. Flame is able to grab images of 
users’ computer screens, record their instant messag-
ing chats, collect passwords, remotely turn on their 
microphones to record audio conversations, scan 
disks for specific files, and monitor their keystrokes 
and network traffic. The software also records Skype 
conversations and can turn infected computers 
into Bluetooth beacons which attempt to download 
contact information from nearby Bluetooth-enabled 
devices. These data, along with locally stored 
 documents, can be sent to one of several command 
and control servers that are scattered around the 
world. The program then awaits further instructions 
from these servers.
The Duqu worm, discovered in September 2011, 
also aims to steal information by scanning systems. 
Duqu infects a very small number of very specific 
systems around the world, but may use completely 
different modules for infiltrating those separate 
 systems. One of Duqu’s actions is to steal digital 
certificates used for authentication from attacked 
computers to help future viruses appear as secure 
software. It is going largely undetected. Security 
researchers believe Duqu was created by the same 
group of programmers behind Stuxnet.
The real worry for security experts and govern-
ment officials is an act of cyberwarfare against a 
critical resource, such as the electric grid, financial 
systems, or communications systems. (In April 
2009, cyberspies infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid, 
using weak points where computers on the grid are 
 connected to the Internet, and left behind  software 
programs whose purpose is unclear, but which 
 presumably could be used to disrupt the system.) 
The U.S. has no clear strategy about how the coun-
try would respond to that level of cyberattack, and the

effects of such an attack would likely be devastating. 
Mike McConnell, the former director of national intel-
ligence, stated that if even a single large American 
bank were successfully attacked, it would have an 
order-of-magnitude greater impact on the global 
 economy than the World Trade Center attacks, and 
that the ability to threaten the U.S. money supply is 
the financial equivalent of a nuclear weapon. 
Many security experts believe that U.S. cybersecu-
rity is not well-organized. Several different agencies, 
including the Pentagon and the National Security 
Agency (NSA), have their sights on being the leading 
agency in the ongoing efforts to combat cyberwar-
fare. The first headquarters designed to coordinate 
government cybersecurity efforts, called Cybercom, 
was activated in May 2010 in the hope of resolving 
this organizational tangle. In May 2011 President 
Barack Obama signed executive orders weaving 
cyber capabilities into U.S. military strategy, but 
these capabilities are still evolving.
In 2014, a virus similar to Stuxnet called Energetic 
Bear was found to have attacked energy companies 
in the U.S. and Europe, lending credence to fears

Click Fraud
When you click on an ad displayed by a search engine, the advertiser  typically 
pays a fee for each click, which is supposed to direct potential buyers to 
its products. Click fraud occurs when an individual or computer program 
fraudulently clicks on an online ad without any intention of learning more 
about the advertiser or making a purchase. Click fraud has become a seri-
ous problem at Google and other Web sites that feature pay-per-click online 
advertising.
Some companies hire third parties (typically from low-wage countries) to 
fraudulently click on a competitor’s ads to weaken them by driving up their 
marketing costs. Click fraud can also be perpetrated with software programs 
doing the clicking, and botnets are often used for this purpose. Search engines 
such as Google attempt to monitor click fraud but have been reluctant to 
 publicize their efforts to deal with the problem.

Global Threats: Cyberterrorism and Cyberwarfare
The cyber criminal activities we have described—launching malware, denial-of-
service attacks, and phishing probes—are borderless. Attack servers for malware 
are now hosted in 206 countries and territories, according to the latest FireEye 
Advanced Threat Report. The most popular sources of malware attacks are the 
United States, Germany, South Korea, China, Netherlands, United Kingdom, 
and Russia (Karlovsky, 2014). The global nature of the Internet makes it  possible 
for cybercriminals to operate—and to do harm—anywhere in the world.
Internet vulnerabilities have also turned individuals and even entire nation 
states into easy targets for politically-motivated hacking to conduct  sabotage 
and espionage. Cyberwarfare is a state-sponsored activity designed to cripple 
and defeat another state or nation by penetrating its computers or networks for 
the purposes of causing damage and disruption.
In general, cyberwarfare attacks have become much more widespread, 
sophisticated, and potentially devastating. There are 250,000 probes trying to 
find their way into the U.S. Department of Defense networks every hour, and 
cyberattacks on U.S. federal agencies have increased 150 percent since 2008. 
Over the years, hackers have stolen plans for missile tracking systems, satellite 
navigation devices, surveillance drones, and leading-edge jet fighters. 
Cyberwarfare poses a serious threat to the infrastructure of modern societ-
ies, since their major financial, health, government, and industrial institutions 
rely on the Internet for daily operations. Cyberwarfare also involves defending 
against these types of attacks. The chapter-ending case discusses this topic in 
greater detail. 
INTERNAL THREATS: EMPLOYEES
We tend to think the security threats to a business originate outside the 
 organization. In fact, company insiders pose serious security problems. 
Employees have access to privileged information, and in the presence of 
sloppy internal security procedures, they are often able to roam throughout an 
 organization’s systems without leaving a trace. 
Studies have found that user lack of knowledge is the single greatest cause 
of network security breaches. Many employees forget their passwords to access 
computer systems or allow co-workers to use them, which compromises the 
system. Malicious intruders seeking system access sometimes trick employees 
into revealing their passwords by pretending to be legitimate members of the 
company in need of information. This practice is called social engineering.
Both end users and information systems specialists are also a major source 
of errors introduced into information systems. End users introduce errors by 
entering faulty data or by not following the proper instructions for process-
ing data and using computer equipment. Information systems specialists may 
 create software errors as they design and develop new software or maintain 
existing programs.
SOFTWARE VULNERABILITY
Software errors pose a constant threat to information systems, causing untold 
losses in productivity, and sometimes endangering people who use or depend 
on systems. Growing complexity and size of software programs, coupled with 
demands for timely delivery to markets, have contributed to an increase in 
software flaws or vulnerabilities. On April 16, 2013, American Airlines had to 
cancel or delay 1,950 flights due to a faulty software patch from a vendor or 
 
Chapter 8 Securing Information Systems 
349

internal software changes that were not properly tested. A systemwide  network 
outage downed the airline’s primary systems that manage airline operations, 
as well as backup systems that kick in when the primary systems fail (Boulton, 
2013).
A major problem with software is the presence of hidden bugs or program 
code defects. Studies have shown that it is virtually impossible to eliminate 
all bugs from large programs. The main source of bugs is the complexity of 
 decision-making code. A relatively small program of several hundred lines will 
contain tens of decisions leading to hundreds or even thousands of different 
paths. Important programs within most corporations are usually much larger, 
containing tens of thousands or even millions of lines of code, each with many 
times the choices and paths of the smaller programs. 
Zero defects cannot be achieved in larger programs. Complete testing simply 
is not  possible. Fully testing programs that contain thousands of choices and 
millions of paths would require thousands of years. Even with rigorous testing, 
you would not know for sure that a piece of software was dependable until the 
product proved itself after much  operational use. 
Flaws in commercial software not only impede performance but also create 
security vulnerabilities that open networks to intruders. Each year security firms 
identify thousands of software vulnerabilities in Internet and PC  software. A 
recent example is the Heartbleed bug, which is a flaw in OpenSSL, an  open-source 
encryption technology that is used by an estimated two-thirds of Web servers. 
Hackers could exploit the bug to access visitors’ personal data as well as a site’s 
encryption keys, which can be used to collect even more “protected” data.
To correct software flaws once they are identified, the software vendor  creates 
small pieces of software called patches to repair the flaws without  disturbing 
the proper  operation of the software. An example is Microsoft’s Windows 7 
Service Pack 1, which features  security, performance, and stability updates for 
Windows 7. It is up to users of the  software to track these vulnerabilities, test, 
and apply all patches. This process is called patch  management.
Because a company’s IT infrastructure is typically laden with multiple 
 business  applications, operating system installations, and other system 
 services, maintaining patches on all devices and services used by a company 
is often time-consuming and costly. Malware is being created so rapidly that 
 companies have very  little time to respond between the time a vulnerability 
and a patch are announced and the time malicious software appears to exploit 
the vulnerability.
8.2 
WHAT IS THE BUSINESS VALUE OF SECURITY 
AND CONTROL?
Many firms are reluctant to spend heavily on security because it is not directly 
related to sales revenue. However, protecting information systems is so critical 
to the operation of the business that it deserves a second look.
Companies have very valuable information assets to protect. Systems often 
house  confidential information about individuals’ taxes, financial assets,  medical 
records, and job performance reviews. They also can contain  information on 
corporate operations,  including trade secrets, new product development plans, 
and marketing strategies. Government  systems may store information on weap-
ons systems, intelligence operations, and  military  targets. These information 
assets have tremendous value, and the repercussions can be  devastating if they 
350 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

are lost, destroyed, or placed in the wrong hands. Systems that are unable to 
 function because of security breaches, disasters, or malfunctioning technology 
can  permanently impact a company’s financial health. Some experts believe 
that 40 percent of all businesses will not recover from application or data losses 
that are not repaired within three days.
Inadequate security and control may result in serious legal liability. 
Businesses must protect not only their own information assets but also those 
of customers, employees, and business partners. Failure to do so may open 
the firm to costly litigation for data exposure or theft. An organization can be 
held liable for needless risk and harm created if the organization fails to take 
 appropriate protective action to prevent loss of confidential information, data 
corruption, or breach of privacy. For example, BJ’s Wholesale Club was sued by 
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for allowing hackers to access its systems 
and steal credit and debit card data for fraudulent purchases. Banks that issued 
the cards with the stolen data sought $13 million from BJ’s to compensate them 
for reimbursing card holders for the fraudulent purchases. A sound security and 
control framework that protects business  information assets can thus  produce a 
high return on investment. Strong security and control also increase employee 
productivity and lower operational costs.
LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR 
ELECTRONIC RECORDS MANAGEMENT
Recent U.S. government regulations are forcing companies to take security 
and control more seriously by mandating the protection of data from abuse, 
 exposure, and unauthorized access. Firms face new legal obligations for the 
retention and storage of electronic records as well as for privacy protection. 
If you work in the health care industry, your firm will need to comply with the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. HIPAA 
outlines medical security and privacy rules and procedures for  simplifying the 
administration of health care billing and automating the transfer of health care 
data between health care providers,  payers, and plans. It requires members of 
the health care industry to retain patient information for six years and ensure 
the confidentiality of those records. It specifies  privacy, security, and  electronic 
transaction standards for health care providers  handling patient information, 
 providing penalties for breaches of medical privacy, disclosure of patient 
records by e-mail, or unauthorized network access. 
If you work in a firm providing financial services, your firm will need to 
 comply with the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, better known as 
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act after its congressional sponsors. This act requires 
financial institutions to ensure the security and confidentiality of  customer data. 
Data must be stored on a secure medium, and special security measures must be 
enforced to protect such data on storage media and  during transmittal.
If you work in a publicly traded company, your company will need to  comply 
with the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 
2002, better known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act after its sponsors Senator Paul 
Sarbanes of Maryland and Representative Michael Oxley of Ohio. This Act was 
designed to protect investors after the financial scandals at Enron, WorldCom, 
and other public companies. It imposes responsibility on companies and their 
management to safeguard the accuracy and integrity of financial information 
that is used internally and released externally. One of the Learning Tracks for 
this chapter discusses Sarbanes-Oxley in detail.
 
Chapter 8 Securing Information Systems 
351

Sarbanes-Oxley is fundamentally about ensuring that internal controls are 
in place to govern the creation and documentation of information in financial 
statements. Because information systems are used to generate, store, and trans-
port such data, the legislation requires firms to consider information systems 
security and other controls required to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and 
accuracy of their data. Each system application that deals with critical financial 
reporting data requires controls to make sure the data are accurate. Controls 
to secure the corporate network, prevent unauthorized access to systems and 
data, and ensure data integrity and availability in the event of disaster or other 
disruption of service are essential as well.
ELECTRONIC EVIDENCE AND COMPUTER FORENSICS
Security, control, and electronic records management have become essential 
for  responding to legal actions. Much of the evidence today for stock fraud, 
embezzlement, theft of  company trade secrets, computer crime, and many civil 
cases is in digital form. In  addition to information from printed or  typewritten 
pages, legal cases today increasingly rely on  evidence  represented as digital 
data stored on portable storage devices, CDs, and computer hard disk drives, 
as well as in e-mail, instant messages, and e-commerce transactions over the 
Internet. E-mail is currently the most common type of  electronic evidence.
In a legal action, a firm is obligated to respond to a discovery request for 
access to  information that may be used as evidence, and the company is 
required by law to produce those data. The cost of responding to a discovery 
request can be enormous if the  company has trouble assembling the required 
data or the data have been corrupted or destroyed. Courts now impose severe 
financial and even criminal penalties for improper destruction of electronic 
documents. 
An effective electronic document retention policy ensures that electronic 
documents, e-mail, and other records are well organized, accessible, and  neither 
retained too long nor discarded too soon. It also reflects an awareness of how 
to preserve potential evidence for computer forensics. Computer forensics is 
the scientific collection, examination, authentication, preservation, and analy-
sis of data held on or retrieved from computer storage media in such a way that 
the information can be used as evidence in a court of law. It deals with the fol-
lowing problems:
• Recovering data from computers while preserving evidential integrity
• Securely storing and handling recovered electronic data
• Finding significant information in a large volume of electronic data
• Presenting the information to a court of law
Electronic evidence may reside on computer storage media in the form of 
computer files and as ambient data, which are not visible to the average user. 
An example might be a file that has been deleted on a PC hard drive. Data that a 
computer user may have deleted on computer storage media can be recovered 
through various techniques. Computer forensics experts try to recover such 
hidden data for presentation as evidence. 
An awareness of computer forensics should be incorporated into a firm’s 
 contingency planning process. The CIO, security specialists, information 
 systems staff, and corporate legal counsel should all work together to have a 
plan in place that can be executed if a legal need arises. You can find out more 
about computer forensics in the Learning Tracks for this chapter.

WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS OF AN 
ORGANIZATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR SECURITY 
AND CONTROL?
Even with the best security tools, your information systems won’t be reliable 
and secure unless you know how and where to deploy them. You’ll need to 
know where your company is at risk and what controls you must have in place 
to protect your information systems. You’ll also need to develop a  security 
 policy and plans for keeping your business running if your information  systems 
aren’t operational.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS CONTROLS
Information systems controls are both manual and automated and consist 
of general and application controls. General controls govern the design, 
 security, and use of computer programs and the security of data files in general 
throughout the organization’s information technology infrastructure. On the 
whole, general controls apply to all  computerized applications and  consist of 
a  combination of hardware, software, and manual procedures that create an 
 overall control environment. 
General controls include software controls, physical hardware controls, 
 computer operations controls, data security controls, controls over implemen-
tation of system  processes, and administrative controls. Table 8.4 describes the 
functions of each of these controls.
Application controls are specific controls unique to each computerized 
application, such as payroll or order processing. They include both  automated 
and manual procedures that ensure that only authorized data are completely 
and accurately processed by that  application. Application  controls can be 
 classified as (1) input controls, (2) processing controls, and (3) output controls.
TABLE 8.4 GENERAL CONTROLS
TYPE OF GENERAL CONTROL
DESCRIPTION
Software controls
Monitor the use of system software and prevent unauthorized access of software programs, system 
software, and computer programs.
Hardware controls
Ensure that computer hardware is physically secure, and check for equipment malfunction. 
Organizations that are critically dependent on their computers also must make provisions for backup 
or continued operation to maintain constant service.
Computer operations controls
Oversee the work of the computer department to ensure that programmed procedures are 
consistently and correctly applied to the storage and processing of data. They include controls over the 
setup of computer processing jobs and backup and recovery procedures for processing that ends 
abnormally.
Data security controls
Ensure that valuable business data files on either disk or tape are not subject to unauthorized access, 
change, or destruction while they are in use or in storage.
Implementation controls
Audit the systems development process at various points to ensure that the process is properly 
controlled and managed.
Administrative controls
Formalize standards, rules, procedures, and control disciplines to ensure that the organization’s 
general and application controls are properly executed and enforced.
 
Chapter 8 Securing Information Systems 
353

Input controls check data for accuracy and completeness when they enter 
the system. There are specific input controls for input authorization, data 
 conversion, data editing, and error handling. Processing controls establish that 
data are complete and accurate during updating. Output controls ensure that the 
results of computer processing are accurate,  complete, and properly  distributed. 
You can find more detail about application and general controls in our Learning 
Tracks.
RISK ASSESSMENT
Before your company commits resources to security and information systems 
controls, it must know which assets require protection and the extent to which 
these assets are vulnerable. A risk assessment helps answer these questions 
and determine the most cost-effective set of controls for protecting assets.
A risk assessment determines the level of risk to the firm if a specific 
 activity or process is not properly controlled. Not all risks can be anticipated 
and  measured, but most businesses will be able to acquire some understand-
ing of the risks they face. Business managers working with information 
 systems  specialists should try to determine the value of information assets, 
points of vulnerability, the likely frequency of a problem, and the potential 
for  damage. For example, if an event is likely to occur no more than once a 
year, with a  maximum of a $1,000 loss to the organization, it is not wise to 
spend $20,000 on the design and maintenance of a control to protect against 
that event. However, if that same event could occur at least once a day, with a 
potential loss of more than $300,000 a year, $100,000 spent on a control might 
be entirely appropriate.
Table 8.5 illustrates sample results of a risk assessment for an online order 
processing system that processes 30,000 orders per day. The likelihood of each 
exposure occurring over a one-year period is expressed as a percentage. The 
next column shows the highest and lowest possible loss that could be expected 
each time the exposure occurred and an average loss calculated by adding the 
highest and lowest figures together and dividing by two. The expected annual 
loss for each exposure can be determined by multiplying the average loss by its 
probability of occurrence.
This risk assessment shows that the probability of a power failure occurring in 
a  one-year period is 30 percent. Loss of order transactions while power is down 
could range from $5,000 to $200,000 (averaging $102,500) for each occurrence, 
depending on how long  processing is halted. The probability of embezzlement 
occurring over a yearly period is about 5  percent, with potential losses ranging 
from $1,000 to $50,000 (and averaging $25,500) for each  occurrence. User errors 
have a 98 percent chance of occurring over a yearly period, with losses ranging 
from $200 to $40,000 (and averaging $20,100) for each occurrence.

Once the risks have been assessed, system builders will concentrate on the 
control points with the greatest vulnerability and potential for loss. In this case, 
controls should focus on ways to minimize the risk of power failures and user 
errors because anticipated annual losses are highest for these areas.
SECURITY POLICY
Once you’ve identified the main risks to your systems, your company will 
need to develop a security policy for protecting the company’s assets. A 
 security policy consists of  statements ranking information risks, identifying 
acceptable security goals, and identifying the  mechanisms for achieving these 
goals. What are the firm’s most important information assets? Who gener-
ates and controls this information in the firm? What existing security policies 
are in place to protect the information? What level of risk is management 
willing to accept for each of these assets? Is it willing, for instance, to lose 
customer credit data once every 10 years? Or will it build a security system 
for credit card data that can withstand the once-in-a-hundred-year disaster? 
Management must estimate how much it will cost to achieve this level of 
acceptable risk. 
The security policy drives other policies determining acceptable use of the 
firm’s information resources and which members of the company have access 
to its information assets. An acceptable use policy (AUP) defines acceptable 
uses of the firm’s information resources and computing equipment, including 
desktop and laptop computers, wireless devices,  telephones, and the Internet. 
The policy should clarify company policy regarding privacy, user responsibil-
ity, and personal use of company equipment and networks. A good AUP defines 
unacceptable and acceptable actions for every user and specifies consequences 
for noncompliance. For example, security policy at Unilever, the giant multina-
tional consumer goods company, requires every employee to use a company-
specified device and employ a password or other method of identification when 
logging onto the corporate network. 
Security policy also includes provisions for identity management. Identity 
 management consists of business processes and software tools for identifying 
the valid users of a  system and controlling their access to system resources. It 
includes policies for identifying and authorizing different categories of system 
users, specifying what systems or portions of  systems each user is allowed 
to access, and the processes and technologies for  authenticating users and 
 protecting their identities.
Figure 8.3 is one example of how an identity management system might 
capture the access rules for different levels of users in the human resources 
function. It specifies what portions of a human resource database each user is 
permitted to access, based on the  information required to perform that person’s 
job. The database contains sensitive personal information such as employees’ 
salaries, benefits, and medical histories. 
The access rules illustrated here are for two sets of users. One set of users 
consists of all employees who perform clerical functions, such as input-
ting employee data into the system. All individuals with this type of pro-
file can update the system but can neither read nor update sensitive fields, 
such as salary, medical history, or earnings data. Another profile applies to 
a  divisional manager, who cannot update the system but who can read all 
employee data fields for his or her division, including medical history and 
salary. We  provide more detail on the technologies for user authentication 
later on in this chapter.

DISASTER RECOVERY PLANNING AND BUSINESS 
CONTINUITY PLANNING
If you run a business, you need to plan for events, such as power outages, floods, 
 earthquakes, or terrorist attacks that will prevent your information  systems 
and your  business from operating. Disaster recovery planning devises plans 
for the restoration of computing and communications services after they have 
been disrupted. Disaster recovery plans focus primarily on the technical issues 
involved in keeping systems up and running, such as which files to back up and 
the maintenance of backup computer systems or disaster recovery  services. 
For example, MasterCard maintains a duplicate computer center in Kansas 
City, Missouri, to serve as an emergency backup to its primary computer center 
in St. Louis. Rather than build their own backup facilities, many firms  contract 
with disaster  recovery firms, such as Comdisco Disaster Recovery Services and 
SunGard Availability Services. These disaster recovery firms  provide hot sites 
 housing spare computers at locations around the country where  subscribing 
firms can run their critical applications in an emergency. For example, 
Champion Technologies, which supplies chemicals used in oil and gas opera-
tions, is able to switch its enterprise systems from Houston to a SunGard data 
center in Scottsdale, Arizona, in two hours. 
Business continuity planning focuses on how the company can restore 
 business operations after a disaster strikes. The business continuity plan

 identifies critical  business processes and determines action plans for  handling 
mission-critical functions if systems go down. For example, Deutsche Bank, 
which provides investment banking and asset management services in 74 
 different countries, has a well-developed business continuity plan that it 
 continually updates and refines. It maintains full-time teams in Singapore, 
Hong Kong, Japan, India, and Australia to coordinate plans addressing loss of 
facilities, personnel, or critical systems so that the company can continue to 
operate when a catastrophic event occurs. Deutsche Bank’s plan distinguishes 
between processes critical for business  survival and those critical to crisis 
 support and is coordinated with the company’s disaster recovery planning for 
its computer centers. 
Business managers and information technology specialists need to work 
together on both types of plans to determine which systems and business 
 processes are most critical to the company. They must conduct a business 
impact analysis to identify the firm’s most  critical systems and the impact a 
 systems outage would have on the business. Management must determine the 
maximum amount of time the business can survive with its systems down and 
which parts of the business must be restored first.
THE ROLE OF AUDITING
How does management know that information systems security and controls 
are  effective? To answer this question, organizations must conduct comprehen-
sive and systematic audits. An information systems audit examines the firm’s 
overall security environment as well as controls  governing individual informa-
tion systems. The auditor should trace the flow of sample transactions through 
the system and perform tests, using, if appropriate, automated audit software. 
The information systems audit may also examine data quality.
Security audits review technologies, procedures, documentation, training, and 
 personnel. A thorough audit will even simulate an attack or disaster to test the 
response of the  technology, information systems staff, and business employees. 
The audit lists and ranks all control weaknesses and estimates the probabil-
ity of their occurrence. It then assesses the financial and organizational impact 
of each threat. Figure 8.4 is a sample auditor’s listing of control weaknesses 
for a loan system. It includes a section for notifying management of such 
 weaknesses and for management’s response. Management is expected to devise 
a plan for countering significant weaknesses in controls.

WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS AND 
TECHNOLOGIES FOR SAFEGUARDING 
INFORMATION RESOURCES?
Businesses have an array of technologies for protecting their informa-
tion resources. They include tools for managing user identities, preventing 
 unauthorized access to systems and data, ensuring system availability, and 
ensuring software quality.
IDENTITY MANAGEMENT AND AUTHENTICATION
Midsize and large companies have complex IT infrastructures and many 
 different  systems, each with its own set of users. Identity management

and shows the results of discussing those weaknesses with management, as well as any corrective

 software automates the process of  keeping track of all these users and their 
system  privileges, assigning each user a unique digital identity for accessing 
each  system. It also includes tools for authenticating users, protecting user 
 identities, and controlling access to system resources.
To gain access to a system, a user must be authorized and authenticated. 
Authentication refers to the ability to know that a person is who he or she 
claims to be. Authentication is often established by using passwords known 
only to authorized users. An end user uses a password to log on to a computer 
system and may also use passwords for accessing  specific systems and files. 
However, users often forget passwords, share them, or choose poor  passwords 
that are easy to guess, which compromises security. Password systems that 
are too rigorous hinder employee productivity. When employees must change 
complex  passwords frequently, they often take shortcuts, such as choosing 
 passwords that are easy to guess or keeping their passwords at their worksta-
tions in plain view. Passwords can also be “sniffed” if transmitted over a  network 
or stolen through social engineering.
New authentication technologies, such as tokens, smart cards, and biomet-
ric authentication, overcome some of these problems. A token is a physical 
device, similar to an  identification card, that is designed to prove the identity 
of a single user. Tokens are small gadgets that typically fit on key rings and 
 display passcodes that change frequently. A smart card is a device about the 
size of a credit card that contains a chip formatted with access permission and 
other data. (Smart cards are also used in electronic payment systems.) A reader 
device interprets the data on the smart card and allows or denies access. 
358 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

Biometric authentication uses systems that read and interpret individ-
ual human traits, such as fingerprints, irises, and voices, in order to grant 
or deny access. Biometric authentication is based on the measurement of a 
physical or behavioral trait that makes each individual unique. It compares 
a person’s unique characteristics, such as the  fingerprints, face, or retinal 
image, against a stored profile of these characteristics to determine whether 
there are any  differences between these characteristics and the stored profile. 
If the two  profiles match, access is granted. Fingerprint and facial recogni-
tion technologies are just beginning to be used for security applications, with 
many PC  laptops (and some smartphones) equipped with  fingerprint identifi-
cation devices and several models with built-in webcams and face  recognition 
software.
The steady stream of incidents in which hackers have been able to access 
traditional passwords highlights the need for more secure means of authentica-
tion. Two-factor authentication increases security by validating users with 
a multi-step process. To be authenticated, a user must provide two means of 
identification, one of which is typically a physical token, such as a smartcard or 
chip-enabled bank card, and the other of which is typically data, such as a pass-
word or PIN (personal identification number). Biometric data, such as finger-
prints, iris prints, or voice prints, can also be used as one of the authenticating 
mechanisms. A common example of two-factor authentication is a bank card: 
the card itself is the physical item and the PIN is the data that go with it.
FIREWALLS, INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEMS, AND 
ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE
Without protection against malware and intruders, connecting to the Internet 
would be very dangerous. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus 
software have become essential business tools.
This smartphone has a 
 biometric  fingerprint reader 
for fast yet secure access to 
files and networks. New 
models of PCs and 
 smartphones are starting to 
use  biometric identification 
to authenticate users.

Firewalls
Firewalls prevent unauthorized users from accessing private networks. A 
firewall is a  combination of hardware and software that controls the flow of 
incoming and outgoing network traffic. It is generally placed between the 
 organization’s private internal networks and distrusted external networks, such 
as the Internet, although firewalls can also be used to protect one part of a 
 company’s network from the rest of the network (see Figure 8.5).
The firewall acts like a gatekeeper who examines each user’s  credentials 
before access is granted to a network. The firewall identifies names, IP 
addresses, applications, and other characteristics of incoming traffic. It checks 
this  information against the access rules that have been programmed into 
the system by the network administrator. The firewall prevents unauthorized 
 communication into and out of the network. 
In large organizations, the firewall often resides on a specially designated 
computer  separate from the rest of the network, so no incoming request directly 
accesses private  network resources. There are a number of firewall screening 
technologies, including static packet filtering, stateful inspection, Network 
Address Translation, and application proxy filtering. They are  frequently used 
in combination to provide firewall protection.
Packet filtering examines selected fields in the headers of data packets  flowing 
back and forth between the trusted network and the Internet, examining 
 individual packets in  isolation. This filtering technology can miss many types of 
attacks. Stateful inspection  provides additional security by determining whether 
 FIGURE 8.5 
A CORPORATE FIREWALL
The firewall is placed between the firm’s private network and the public Internet or another distrusted network to protect against 
 unauthorized traffic.
360 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

packets are part of an ongoing dialogue between a sender and a receiver. It sets 
up state tables to track information over multiple packets. Packets are accepted 
or rejected based on whether they are part of an approved conversation or 
whether they are attempting to establish a legitimate connection. 
Network Address Translation (NAT) can provide another layer of protection 
when static packet filtering and stateful inspection are employed. NAT  conceals 
the IP addresses of the organization’s internal host computer(s) to prevent 
 sniffer programs outside the firewall from ascertaining them and using that 
information to penetrate internal systems.
Application proxy filtering examines the application content of packets. A proxy 
server stops data packets originating outside the organization, inspects them, and 
passes a proxy to the other side of the firewall. If a user outside the company 
wants to communicate with a user inside the organization, the  outside user first 
“talks” to the proxy application and the proxy application  communicates with the 
firm’s internal computer. Likewise, a computer user inside the organization goes 
through the proxy to talk with computers on the outside. 
To create a good firewall, an administrator must maintain detailed  internal 
rules identifying the people, applications, or addresses that are allowed or 
rejected. Firewalls can deter, but not completely prevent, network penetra-
tion by outsiders and should be viewed as one element in an overall security 
plan.
Intrusion Detection Systems
In addition to firewalls, commercial security vendors now provide intrusion 
detection tools and services to protect against suspicious network traffic and 
attempts to access files and databases. Intrusion detection systems feature 
full-time monitoring tools placed at the most vulnerable points or “hot spots” 
of  corporate networks to detect and deter intruders  continually. The system 
 generates an alarm if it finds a suspicious or anomalous event. Scanning  software 
looks for patterns indicative of known methods of computer attacks, such as 
bad  passwords, checks to see if important files have been removed or modified, 
and sends warnings of vandalism or system administration errors. Monitoring 
 software  examines events as they are happening to discover security attacks in 
progress. The  intrusion  detection tool can also be customized to shut down a 
 particularly sensitive part of a network if it receives unauthorized traffic.
Antivirus and Antispyware Software
Defensive technology plans for both individuals and businesses must include 
anti-malware protection for every computer. Antivirus software prevents, 
detects, and removes malware, including computer viruses, computer worms, 
Trojan horses, spyware, and adware. However, most antivirus software is 
 effective only against malware already known when the software was  written. 
To remain effective, the antivirus software must be continually updated, and 
even then it is not always effective. According to a report by Solutionary 
Security Engineering Research Team (SERT), 54 percent of malware evades 
anti-virus detection. Organizations need to use additional malware detection 
tools for better protection (Solutionary, 2013). 
Unified Threat Management Systems
To help businesses reduce costs and improve manageability, security vendors 
have  combined into a single appliance various security tools, including fire-
walls, virtual private networks, intrusion detection systems, and Web content 
 
Chapter 8 Securing Information Systems 
361

filtering and antispam software. These  comprehensive security management 
products are called unified threat management (UTM) systems. Although 
initially aimed at small and medium-sized businesses, UTM products are 
available for all sizes of networks. Leading UTM vendors include Blue Coat, 
Fortinent, and Check Point, and networking vendors such as Cisco Systems and 
Juniper Networks provide some UTM capabilities in their products.
SECURING WIRELESS NETWORKS
The initial security standard developed for Wi-Fi, called Wired Equivalent 
Privacy (WEP), is not very effective because its encryption keys are relatively 
easy to crack. WEP provides some margin of security, however, if users remem-
ber to enable it. Corporations can  further improve Wi-Fi security by using it 
in conjunction with virtual private network (VPN)  technology when accessing 
internal corporate data.
In June 2004, the Wi-Fi Alliance industry trade group finalized the 802.11i 
specification (also referred to as Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 or WPA2) that 
replaces WEP with stronger security standards. Instead of the static encryption 
keys used in WEP, the new standard uses much longer keys that continually 
change, making them harder to crack. It also employs an encrypted authentica-
tion system with a central authentication server to ensure that only authorized 
users access the network.
ENCRYPTION AND PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE
Many businesses use encryption to protect digital information that they store, 
physically transfer, or send over the Internet. Encryption is the process of 
transforming plain text or data into cipher text that cannot be read by anyone 
other than the sender and the intended receiver. Data are encrypted by using a 
secret numerical code, called an encryption key, that transforms plain data into 
cipher text. The message must be decrypted by the receiver.
Two methods for encrypting network traffic on the Web are SSL and S-HTTP. 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and its successor Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
enable client and server computers to manage encryption and decryption 
 activities as they communicate with each other during a secure Web session. 
Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP) is another protocol used 
for encrypting data flowing over the Internet, but it is limited to individual 
 messages, whereas SSL and TLS are designed to establish a secure connection 
between two computers.
The capability to generate secure sessions is built into Internet client browser 
software and servers. The client and the server negotiate what key and what 
level of security to use. Once a secure session is established between the client 
and the server, all messages in that session are encrypted.
Two methods of encryption are symmetric key encryption and public key 
encryption. In symmetric key encryption, the sender and receiver establish a 
secure Internet session by creating a single encryption key and sending it to 
the receiver so both the sender and receiver share the same key. The strength 
of the encryption key is measured by its bit length. Today, a typical key will be 
128 bits long (a string of 128 binary digits).
The problem with all symmetric encryption schemes is that the key itself 
must be shared somehow among the senders and receivers, which exposes 
the key to outsiders who might just be able to intercept and decrypt the key. 
362 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

A more secure form of encryption called public key encryption uses two 
keys: one shared (or public) and one totally private as shown in Figure 8.6. 
The keys are mathematically related so that data encrypted with one key 
can be decrypted using only the other key. To send and receive messages, 
 communicators first  create separate pairs of private and public keys. The public 
key is kept in a  directory and the private key must be kept secret. The sender 
encrypts a  message with the recipient’s public key. On receiving the message, 
the  recipient uses his or her private key to decrypt it.
Digital certificates are data files used to establish the identity of users and 
electronic assets for protection of online transactions (see Figure 8.7). A digital 
certificate system uses a trusted third party, known as a certificate authority 
 FIGURE 8.6 
PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION 
A public key encryption system can be viewed as a series of public and private keys that lock data when they are transmitted and unlock 
the data when they are received. The sender locates the recipient’s public key in a directory and uses it to encrypt a message. The message 
is sent in encrypted form over the Internet or a private network. When the encrypted message arrives, the recipient uses his or her private 
key to decrypt the data and read the message.
 FIGURE 8.7 
DIGITAL CERTIFICATES
Digital certificates help establish the identity of people or electronic assets. They protect online 
 transactions by providing secure, encrypted, online communication.
 
Chapter 8 Securing Information Systems

(CA, or certification authority), to validate a user’s identity. There are many 
CAs in the United States and around the world, including Symantec, GoDaddy, 
and Comodo. 
The CA verifies a digital certificate user’s identity offline. This informa-
tion is put into a CA server, which generates an encrypted digital certificate 
 containing owner  identification information and a copy of the owner’s public 
key. The certificate authenticates that the  public key belongs to the desig-
nated owner. The CA makes its own public key available either in print or 
perhaps on the Internet. The recipient of an encrypted message uses the CA’s 
public key to decode the digital certificate attached to the message,  verifies 
it was issued by the CA, and then obtains the sender’s public key and identi-
fication  information  contained in the certificate. Using this information, the 
recipient can send an encrypted reply. The digital certificate system would 
enable, for example, a credit card user and a  merchant to validate that their 
digital certificates were issued by an authorized and trusted third party before 
they exchange data. Public key infrastructure (PKI), the use of public key 
cryptography working with a CA, is now widely used in e-commerce.
ENSURING SYSTEM AVAILABILITY
As companies increasingly rely on digital networks for revenue and opera-
tions, they need to take additional steps to ensure that their systems and 
applications are always available. Firms such as those in the airline and finan-
cial services industries with critical  applications  requiring online transaction 
processing have traditionally used fault-tolerant computer  systems for many 
years to ensure 100 percent availability. In online transaction  processing, 
transactions entered online are immediately processed by the computer. 
Multitudinous changes to databases, reporting, and requests for information 
occur each instant. 
Fault-tolerant computer systems contain redundant hardware,  software, 
and power supply components that create an environment that provides 
 continuous, uninterrupted  service. Fault-tolerant computers use special 
 software routines or self-checking logic built into their circuitry to detect 
 hardware failures and automatically switch to a backup device. Parts from these 
computers can be removed and repaired without disruption to the computer 
or downtime. Downtime refers to periods of time in which a system is not 
operational.
Controlling Network Traffic: Deep Packet Inspection
Have you ever tried to use your campus network and found it was very 
slow? It may be because your fellow students are using the network to 
 download music or watch YouTube. Bandwith-consuming applications such as 
 file- sharing programs, Internet phone service, and online video are able to clog 
and slow down corporate networks, degrading  performance. For  example, Ball 
State University in Muncie, Indiana, found its network had slowed because a 
small minority of students were using P2P file-sharing programs to download 
movies and music.
A technology called deep packet inspection (DPI) helps solve this  problem. 
DPI  examines data files and sorts out low-priority online material while assign-
ing higher  priority to business-critical files. Based on the priorities established 
by a network’s  operators, it decides whether a specific data packet can continue 
to its destination or should be blocked or delayed while more important traffic 
364 Part Two Information Technology Infrastructure

proceeds. Using a DPI system from Allot Communications, Ball State was able 
to cap the amount of file-sharing traffic and assign it a much lower  priority. Ball 
State’s preferred network traffic speeded up.
Security Outsourcing
Many companies, especially small businesses, lack the resources or expertise 
to provide a secure high-availability computing environment on their own. 
They can outsource many security functions to managed security service 
 providers (MSSPs) that monitor  network activity and perform vulnerability 
testing and intrusion detection. SecureWorks, BT Managed Security Solutions 
Group, and Symantec are leading providers of MSSP services.
SECURITY ISSUES FOR CLOUD COMPUTING AND THE 
MOBILE DIGITAL PLATFORM
Although cloud computing and the emerging mobile digital platform have the 
potential to deliver powerful benefits, they pose new challenges to system 
security and reliability. We now describe some of these challenges and how 
they should be addressed.
Security in the Cloud
When processing takes place in the cloud, accountability and responsibility 
for protection of sensitive data still reside with the company owning that data. 
Understanding how the cloud computing provider organizes its services and 
manages the data is critical. 
Cloud computing is highly distributed. Cloud applications reside in large 
remote data centers and server farms that supply business services and data 
management for multiple corporate clients. To save money and keep costs low, 
cloud computing providers often  distribute work to data centers around the 
globe where work can be accomplished most efficiently. When you use the 
cloud, you may not know precisely where your data are being hosted. 
The dispersed nature of cloud computing makes it difficult to track 
 unauthorized  activity. Virtually all cloud providers use encryption, such as 
Secure Sockets Layer, to secure the data they handle while the data are being 
transmitted. But if the data are stored on devices that also store other compa-
nies’ data, it’s important to ensure these stored data are encrypted as well. 
Companies expect their systems to be running 24/7, but cloud providers 
haven’t always been able to provide this level of service. On several occasions 
over the past few years, the cloud services of Amazon.com and Salesforce.
com experienced outages that disrupted business operations for millions of 
users. 
Cloud users need to confirm that regardless of where their data are stored, 
they are protected at a level that meets their corporate requirements. They 
should stipulate that the cloud provider store and process data in specific 
 jurisdictions according to the privacy rules of those jurisdictions. Cloud  clients 
should find how the cloud provider segregates their  corporate data from those 
of other companies and ask for proof that encryption mechanisms are sound. 
It’s also important to know how the cloud provider will respond if a disaster 
strikes, whether the provider will be able to completely restore your data, and 
how long this should take. Cloud users should also ask whether cloud  providers 
will submit to external audits and security certifications. These kinds of  controls 
 
Chapter 8 Securing Information Systems 
365

can be written into the service level agreement (SLA) before signing with a 
cloud provider.
Securing Mobile Platforms
If mobile devices are performing many of the functions of computers, they 
need to be secured like desktops and laptops against malware, theft, accidental 
loss, unauthorized access, and hacking attempts.
Mobile devices accessing corporate systems and data require special 
 protection. Companies should make sure that their corporate security policy 
includes mobile devices, with additional details on how mobile devices should 
be supported, protected, and used. They will need mobile device manage-
ment tools to authorize all devices in use; to maintain accurate inventory 
records on all mobile devices, users, and applications; to control updates to 
 applications; and to lock down or erase lost or stolen devices so they can’t be 
compromised. Data loss prevention technology can identify where critical 
data are saved, who is accessing the data, how data are leaving the company, 
and where the data are going. Firms should develop guidelines stipulating 
approved mobile platforms and software applications as well as the required 
software and procedures for remote access of corporate systems. The organi-
zation’s mobile security policy should forbid employees from using unsecure, 
consumer-based applications for transferring and storing corporate docu-
ments and files, or sending such documents and files to oneself via e-mail 
without encryption.
Companies should encrypt communication whenever possible. All mobile 
device users should be required to use the password  feature found in every 
smartphone. Mobile security products are available from Kaspersky, Symantec, 
Trend Micro, and McAfee.
Some companies insist that employees use only company-issued 
 smartphones. BlackBerry devices are considered the most secure because 
they run within their own secure system. But, increasingly, companies are 
allowing employees to use their own devices, including iPhones, iPads, and 
Android phones, for work, to make employees more available and  productive 
(see the Chapter 5 discussion of BYOD). Protective software products, such as 
the tools from Good Technology, are now available for segregating  corporate 
data housed within personally owned mobile devices from the device’s 
 personal content. 
ENSURING SOFTWARE QUALITY
In addition to implementing effective security and controls, organizations 
can improve  system quality and reliability by employing software metrics 
and  rigorous software  testing. Software metrics are objective assessments of 
the  system in the form of quantified  measurements. Ongoing use of metrics 
allows the information systems department and end users to jointly measure 
the  performance of the system and identify problems as they occur. Examples 
of software metrics include the number of transactions that can be processed 
in a specified unit of time, online response time, the number of payroll checks 
printed per hour, and the number of known bugs per hundred lines of program 
code. For metrics to be  successful, they must be carefully designed, formal, 
objective, and used consistently.

BMWEB, launched in 1997, became South Africa’s 
leading ISP in 1998. It has established itself as a 
company that provides a cutting-edge network and 
service infrastructure and outstanding customer ser-
vice. Currently, MWEB’s customer base of 320,000 
includes home users; small, medium, and large 
business customers; and corporate clients. MWEB 
won the ISP of the Year award at the MyBroadband 
Conference in Johannesburg in 2010. The award was 
based on the performance of its various broadband 
services as well as on customer satisfaction.
Its business division, MWEB Business, was 
founded in January 1998. MWEB Business prides 
itself as being a business partner that is perfectly 
positioned to leverage the power of Web-based 
technologies in all areas of an organization. MWEB 
Business helps companies:
•  Manage business data in ways that add real 
value and insight to their operations.
•  Integrate existing systems with the Internet so 
as to close the gap between technology, strategy, 
and the organization’s bottom line.
•  Develop, manage, and maintain solutions that 
include all aspects of Internet connectivity, Web 
site development and hosting, broadband and 
wireless applications, e-commerce, and consult-
tancy services .
•  Manage internal information among employees, 
as well as among business partners and suppli-
ers.
MWEB has moved forward in publicizing its plans 
for the South African Internet market. According 
to MWEB CEO Rudi Jansen, the company needs to 
improve the quality of their network, which is not 
only an MWEB problem, but also a Telkom network 
problem. Despite having a less-than-ideal network 
infrastructure, MWEB uses AVG Internet Security to 
offer its customers the best possible security while 
online. AVG Internet Security offers MWEB custom-
ers the following features:
•  Identity protection for safe banking and shop-
ping
• LinkScanner for safe surfing and searching
•  WebShield for safe social networking, chatting, 
and downloading
•  Antiphishing and antispam for a safe unclut-
tered inbox
•  High-speed antivirus/antispyware software with 
automatic updates
• An enhanced firewall
In addition, MWEB automatically protects custom-
ers against junk email and viruses that are sent via 
email. Its virus filter ensures that only virus-free 
email is delivered to clients’ inboxes by automatically 
cleaning e-mails from recognized malware sources. 
MWEB advises its customers to keep their ADSL 
connections safe from bandwidth theft and account 
abuse by blocking unsolicited incoming connections 
to network ports commonly used by hackers.
Despite the multitude of security services offered 
by MWEB, a number of MWEB Business subscribers’ 
account details were compromised when their login 
and password details were published on the Internet 
by hackers. Initial reports indicated that as many as 
2,390 users of MWEB’s business digital subscriber 
lines were affected. The company disclosed the secu-
rity breach on October 25, 2010. It appears that hack-
ers gained access to Internet Solutions’ self-service 
management system, which MWEB Business uses to 
provide and manage business accounts that have not 
yet been migrated to the MWEB network.
Historically, MWEB Business was a reseller of 
Internet Solutions’ Uncapped & Fixed IP ADSL 
services, which were provisioned and managed by 
MWEB using a Web-based management interface pro-
vided by Internet Solutions. All new Business ADSL 
services provided after April 2010, as well as the bulk 
of legacy services already migrated, used MWEB’s 
internal authentication systems, which were com-
pletely unaffected by this incident.
MWEB responded quickly to the hacking inci-
dent. According to Jansen, about 1,000 clients on the 
Internet Solutions network needed to be migrated 
from the old server that was attacked by hackers. 
Although the network was quickly secured, most 
customers had recently been moved to MWEB’s IPC 
network. MWEB also contacted these customers to 
reset their passwords as an added security measure.  
Jansen was quick to note that no personal informa-
tion was lost and that none of MWEB’s clients suf-
fered any losses as their usernames and passwords 
had been recreated and changed. He further added 
that MWEB successfully repels 5,000 attacks a day.
Andre Joubert, general manager of MWEB 
Business, emphasized that only ADSL authentica-

tion usernames and passwords had been compro-

related to the accounts remained intact, as did the 
access credentials for each customer’s bundled onsite 
router. Joubert did acknowledge the seriousness 
of the hack, apologizing for any inconvenience the 
breach may have caused to MWEB’s customers. As 
soon as the breach was identified, MWEB took imme-
diate action to evaluate the extent of the breach and 
to limit any damage. In MWEB’s defense, Jansen said 
that MWEB constantly advises its customers to be 
vigilant regarding their online data and security. In 
addition, MWEB was working closely with Internet 
Solutions to investigate the nature and source of the 
breach to ensure that it does not happen again.

Early, regular, and thorough testing will contribute significantly to system 
quality. Many view testing as a way to prove the correctness of work they have 
done. In fact, we know that all sizable software is riddled with errors, and we 
must test to uncover these errors. 
Good testing begins before a software program is even written by using 
a walkthrough—a review of a specification or design document by a small 
group of people carefully selected based on the skills needed for the particu-
lar  objectives being tested. Once developers start writing software programs, 
coding  walkthroughs can also be used to review program code. However, code 
must be tested by computer runs. When errors are discovered, the source is 
found and eliminated through a process called debugging. You can find out 
more about the various stages of testing required to put an information system 
into operation in Chapter 13. Our Learning Tracks also contain descriptions 
of methodologies for developing software programs that also contribute to 
 software quality.

Review Summary
1. Why are information systems vulnerable to destruction, error, and abuse? 
Digital data are vulnerable to destruction, misuse, error, fraud, and hardware or software  failures. 
The Internet is designed to be an open system and makes internal corporate  systems more vulnerable 
to actions from outsiders. Hackers can unleash denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or penetrate corporate 
networks, causing serious system disruptions. Wi-Fi networks can easily be penetrated by intruders 
using sniffer programs to obtain an address to access the resources of the network. Computer viruses 
and worms can disable systems and Web sites. The dispersed nature of cloud computing makes it 
 difficult to track unauthorized  activity or to apply controls from afar. Software presents problems 
because software bugs may be impossible to eliminate and because software vulnerabilities can be 
exploited by hackers and malicious software. End users often  introduce errors.
2. What is the business value of security and control? 
Lack of sound security and control can cause firms relying on computer systems for their core 
 business functions to lose sales and productivity. Information assets, such as confidential employee 
records, trade secrets, or business plans, lose much of their value if they are revealed to outsiders or if 
they expose the firm to legal liability. New laws, such as HIPAA, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, require companies to practice stringent electronic records management and 
adhere to strict standards for security, privacy, and control. Legal actions requiring electronic  evidence 
and computer forensics also require firms to pay more attention to security and electronic records 
management.
3. What are the components of an organizational framework for security and control? 
What are the components of an organizational framework for security and control? Firms need to 
establish a good set of both general and application controls for their information  systems. A risk 
assessment evaluates information assets, identifies control points and control  weaknesses, and 
 determines the most cost-effective set of controls. Firms must also develop a  coherent corporate 
 security policy and plans for continuing business operations in the event of disaster or  disruption. The 
security policy includes policies for acceptable use and identity management. Comprehensive and 
systematic information systems auditing helps organizations determine the effectiveness of  security 
and controls for their information systems. 
4. What are the most important tools and technologies for safeguarding information resources?
Firewalls prevent unauthorized users from accessing a private network when it is linked to the 
Internet. Intrusion detection systems monitor private networks from suspicious network traffic and 
attempts to access corporate systems. Passwords, tokens, smart cards, and biometric authentication are 
used to authenticate system users. Antivirus software checks computer systems for infections by viruses 
and worms and often eliminates the malicious software, while antispyware software combats intrusive 
and harmful spyware programs. Encryption, the coding and scrambling of messages, is a widely used 
technology for securing electronic transmissions over unprotected networks. Digital  certificates 
 combined with public key encryption provide further protection of electronic transactions by authenti-
cating a user’s identity. Companies can use fault-tolerant computer systems to make sure that their 
 information systems are always available. Use of software metrics and rigorous software testing help 
improve software quality and  reliability.

Information Security Threats and Policies in Europe
CASE STUDY
T
he IT sector is one of the key drivers of 
the European economy. It has been esti-
mated that 60 percent of Europeans use 
the Internet regularly. Additionally, 87 per-
cent own or have access to mobile phones. In 2009, 
the European broadband market was the largest in 
the world. These facts demonstrate the importance 
of ensuring the security and safe operation of the 
Internet for the well-being of the European economy. 
The safety and security of the Internet have been 
threatened in recent years as Internet-based cyber 
attacks have become increasingly sophisticated.
In 2007, Estonia suffered a massive cyber attack that 
affected the government, the banking system, media, 
and other services. The attack was performed using 
a variety of techniques, ranging from simple indi-
vidual ping commands and message flooding to more 
sophisticated distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) 
attacks. Hackers coordinated the attack by using a 
large number of compromised servers organized in 
a botnet distributed around the world. A botnet is a 
network of autonomous malicious software agents 
that are under the control of a bot commander. The 
network is created by installing malware that exploits 
the vulnerabilities of Web servers, operating systems, 
or applications to take control of the infected comput-
ers. Once a computer is infected it becomes part of a 
network of thousands of “zombies,” machines that are 
commanded to carry out the attack.
The cyber attack on Estonia started in late April 
2007 and lasted for almost 3 weeks. During this 
period, vital parts of the Estonian Internet network 
had to be closed from access from outside the coun-
try, causing millions of dollars in economic losses.
At around the same time, Arsys, an important 
Spanish domain registration company, was also tar-
geted by international hackers. Arsys reported that 
hackers had stolen codes that were then used to insert 
links to external servers containing malicious codes 
in the Web pages of some of its clients.
In 2009, an estimated 10 million computers were 
infected with the Conflicker worm worldwide. France, 
the UK, and Germany were among the European 
countries that suffered the most infections. The 
French navy had to ground all military planes when 
it was discovered that its computer network was 
infected. In the UK, the worm infected computers 
in the Ministry of Defense, the city of Manchester’s 
city council and police IT network, some hospitals 
in the city of Sheffield, and other government offices 
across the country. Computers in the network of the 
German army were also reported as infected. Once 
installed on a computer, Conflicker is able to down-
load and install other malware from controlled Web 
sites, and thus infected computers could be under full 
control of the hackers.
More recently, a sophisticated malware threat tar-
geting industrial systems was detected in Germany, 
Norway, China, Iran, India, Indonesia, and other 
countries. The malware, known as Stuxnet, infected 
Windows PCs running the Supervisory Control and 
Data Acquisition (SCADA) control system from the 
German company Siemens. Stuxnet was propagated 
via USB devices. Experts estimated that up to 1,000 
machines were infected on a daily basis at the peak 
of the infection. The malware, hidden in shortcuts 
to executable programs (files with extension .lnk), 
was executed automatically when the content of an 
infected USB drive was displayed. Employing this 
same technique, the worm was capable of installing 
other malware. Initially, security experts disclosed 
that Stuxnet was designed to steal industrial secrets 
from SIMATIC WinCC, a visualization and control 
software system from Siemens. However, data gath-
ered later by other experts indicates that the worm 
was actually looking for some specific programmable 
logic controller (PLC) devices used in a specific indus-
trial plant, a fact that points to the possibility that the 
malware was part of a well-planned act of sabotage. 
Even though none of the sites infected with Stuxnet 
suffered physical damage, the significance that such 
a sophisticated threat represents to the industrial 
resources in Europe and other parts of the world 
cannot be underestimated.
As of 2001, EU member states had independent 
groups of experts that were responsible for respond-
ing to incidents in information security. These groups 
lacked coordination and did not exchange much 
information. To overcome this, in 2004 the European 
Commission established the European Network 
and Information Security Agency (ENISA) with the 
goal of coordinating efforts to prevent and respond 
 
Chapter 8 Securing Information Systems 
373

more effectively to potentially more harmful secu-
rity threats. ENISA’s main objectives are to secure 
Europe’s information infrastructure, promote secu-
rity standards, and educate the general public about 
security issues.
ENISA organized the first pan-European Critical 
Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) exer-
cise, which took place in November 2010. This exer-
cise tested the efficiency of procedures and com-
munication links between member states in case an 
incident were to occur that would affect the normal 
operation of the Internet. ENISA acts as a facilitator 
and information broker for the Computer Emergency 
Response Teams (CERT), working with the public and 
private sectors of most EU member states.
The European Commission has recently launched 
the Digital Agenda for Europe. The goal of this ini-
tiative is to define the key role that information and 
communication technologies will play in 2020. The 
initiative calls for a single, open European digital 
market. Another goal is that broadband speeds of 
30Mbps be available to all European citizens by 2020. 
In terms of security, the initiative is considering the 
implementation of measures to protect privacy and 
the establishment of a well-functioning network of 
CERT to prevent cybercrime and respond effectively 
to cyber attacks.

hen Alimentation Couche-Tard purchased Statoil Fuel and Retail 
(SFR) in April 2012, it was the Canadian convenience store giant’s 
most ambitious acquisition to date (€2.058 billion). SFR, a divi-
sion of Statoil, the Norwegian State Oil Company, had been spun 
off from its parent in October 2010. The purchase added 2,300 retail fuel sta-
tions—most full-service with a convenience store—to its over 6,200 stores 
throughout North America and expanded Couche-Tard’s reach to eight 
European countries—Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, and Russia.
SFR operates in both the B2C (sales to consumers)  and B2B (sales to other 
businesses) sectors. Fuel products including gasoline blends, diesel fuels, bio-
fuels, and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) generate 70 percent of its business. 
The full-service retail stations offer product lines that differ according to oper-
ator and location factors. Some prefer a product mix that concentrates on auto 
supplies and services while others focus on food-related products, beverages, 
and even fast-food.  SFR’s 12 terminals, 38 depots, and 400 road tankers pro-
vide bulk sales to commercial customers, including bus and car rental com-
panies, road construction crews, and independent resellers. In addition, SFR 
sells stationary energy, marine fuel, more than 750 lubricants, and various 
chemicals, and it delivers aviation fuel to 85 airports in ten countries. 
Couche-Tard welcomed both the opportunities and the challenges of its 
acquisition. While its increased size and global presence could be leveraged 
to exact cost savings from suppliers, retail fuel stations always operate on 
slim margins, necessitating continual cost savings efforts. Immediate syner-
gies between Couche-Tard and SFR could not completely cover the remaining 
expenses from SFR’s split from Statoil, rebranding efforts, and the replacement

resulting in over 5,000 custom software objects for the IT department to manage 
and massive operational inefficiencies. 
SFR needed to maximize supply chain efficiency for its three closely related 
value chains—the fuel value chain, the grocery value chain, and the lubricants 
value chain. All corporate functions that provided shared services to the value 
chains had to be standardized and workplace activities coordinated for its 18,500 
employees. Finally, SFR managers wanted an advanced pricing method for fuel 
sales to maximize profits in its core low-margin business.
Oracle’s JD Edwards EnterpriseOne enterprise resource planning system 
was chosen as the basic platform, and a Web services interface was devel-
oped within the ERP system to convert all data into a single format.  Replacing 
numerous separate legacy systems with a single ERP forces managers to 
develop common data definitions.  This common source of master data now 
drives all transactions throughout the supply chains, as well as financial  and 
other reports generated by the Oracle Business Intelligence Suite. Stock avail-
ability and average sales at each service station feed a real-time planning pro-
gram that projects expected demand and feeds the data to a third-party distribu-
tion planning system. Onboard computers convey product types and quantities 
to tanker drivers at terminals and delivery locations. Fuel restocking, delivery, 
and confirmation occur automatically. Supplies are quickly transferred from 
depots or between stations to meet fluctuating demand. With the value chains 
optimized, inventory holding costs are minimized.
To coordinate workplace activities, Oracle Fusion Middleware integrates data 
management and communication across social, mobile, and cloud technolo-
gies and among multiple systems and regions. Called the “Connect Project,” the 
software coordinates dozens of interfaces throughout the supply chain, imple-
ments a consistent fuel pricing structure, and manages multiple complicated 
excise taxes and regulations.  The project was implemented in Sweden in June 
and in Denmark and Norway in October 2013. Scandinavia accounts for over 80 
percent  of SFR’s revenue. Rollout is expected to be complete in 2014. 
A series of Web portals created with Oracle WebCenter Portal provide 
access to all internal sales, distribution, and planning systems. Fuel stations 
all use a common interface to connect to the point-of-sale system, and a new 
e-commerce portal simplifies ordering from the depots and is expected to sig-
nificantly strengthen e-commerce revenue. A proprietary demand-based pric-
ing algorithm updates fuel prices several times daily based on nearby competi-
tors in each micro-market. For managers and marketing personnel, this means 
most and least profitable stations and markets are identified and incentive and 
discounting initiatives can be accurately targeted.

HOW DO ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS HELP 
BUSINESSES ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL 
EXCELLENCE?
A
round the globe, companies are increasingly becoming more 
 connected, both internally and with other companies. If you run 
a business, you’ll want to be able to react  instantaneously when a 
customer places a large order or when a shipment from a supplier 
is delayed. You may also want to know the impact of these events on every 
part of the business and how the business is performing at any point in time, 
 especially if you’re running a large company. Enterprise systems provide the 
integration to make this possible. Let’s look at how they work and what they 
can do for the firm.
data nor uniform methods for handling many critical SCM functions. Inventory 
holding costs were unnecessarily high, the IT department was strained, and 
lack of coordination was negatively impacting workplace productivity.  
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter. All transactions throughout SFR’s supply chains are 
now in a common and consistent format that feeds directly into SFR’s reporting 
software. The integrated ERP environment enables real-time planning based on 
stock availability and average sales at each service station, and a real-time fuel 
value chain can now accommodate variable demand from both consumer and 
business customers.
Benchmarks against which to assess future results by country, terminal, or 
market are being developed using the advanced pricing method developed by 
the Connect team. On the B2B side, managers will be able to quickly assess 
the effects of pricing structures and even sales reps will be able to evaluate the 
effects of purchasing terms.
Here are some questions to think about: How did SFR’s lack of standard-
ized processes affect its business operations? How were SFR’s employees and 
supply chain management affected by the adoption of standardized interfaces?  
Why did SFR retain its legacy systems instead of replacing them entirely?

WHAT ARE ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS?
Imagine that you had to run a business based on information from tens or even 
hundreds of different databases and systems, none of which could speak to one 
another? Imagine your company had 10 different major product lines, each 
 produced in separate factories, and each with separate and incompatible sets of 
systems controlling production, warehousing, and distribution. 
At the very least, your decision making would often be based on manual 
 hard-copy reports, often out of date, and it would be difficult to really  understand 
what is happening in the business as a whole. Sales personnel might not be 
able to tell at the time they place an order whether the ordered items are in 
 inventory, and manufacturing could not easily use sales data to plan for new 
production. You now have a good idea of why firms need a special enterprise 
system to  integrate information. 
Chapter 2 introduced enterprise systems, also known as enterprise resource 
 planning (ERP) systems, which are based on a suite of integrated software 
 modules and a  common  central database. The database collects data from many 
different  divisions and  departments in a firm, and from a large number of key 
business processes in  manufacturing and  production, finance and account-
ing, sales and marketing, and human resources,  making the data  available 
for  applications that support nearly all of an organization’s internal  business 
 activities. When new information is entered by one process, the information is 
made  immediately available to other business processes (see Figure 9.1). 
If a sales representative places an order for tire rims, for example, the system 
verifies the customer’s credit limit, schedules the shipment, identifies the best 
shipping route, and reserves the necessary items from inventory. If inventory 
 FIGURE 9.1 
HOW ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS WORK
Enterprise systems feature a set of integrated software modules and a central database that enables 
data to be shared by many different business processes and functional areas throughout the 
 enterprise.
382 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

stock is insufficient to fill the order, the system schedules the manufacture of 
more rims, ordering the needed materials and components from suppliers. 
Sales and production forecasts are immediately updated. General ledger and 
 corporate cash levels are automatically updated with the revenue and cost 
information from the order. Users could tap into the system and find out where 
that  particular order was at any minute. Management could obtain information 
at any point in time about how the business was operating. The system could 
also generate enterprise-wide data for management analyses of product cost 
and profitability.
ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE
Enterprise software is built around thousands of predefined business 
 processes that reflect best practices. Table 9.1 describes some of the major 
 business  processes supported by  enterprise software.
Companies implementing this software would have to first select the  functions 
of the system they wished to use and then map their business processes to the 
predefined  business processes in the software. (One of our Learning Tracks 
shows how SAP  enterprise  software handles the procurement process for a new 
piece of equipment.) A firm would use configuration tables provided by the 
software manufacturer to tailor a  particular aspect of the system to the way it 
does business. For example, the firm could use these tables to select whether 
it wants to track revenue by product line,  geographical unit, or  distribution 
channel.
If the enterprise software does not support the way the organization does 
business, companies can rewrite some of the software to support the way their 
business processes work. However, enterprise software is unusually complex, 
and extensive customization may degrade system performance, compromis-
ing the information and process integration that are the main benefits of the 
 system. If companies want to reap the maximum benefits from enterprise 
 software, they must change the way they work to conform to the business 
 processes defined by the software. 
To implement a new enterprise system, Tasty Baking Company identified 
its existing business processes and then translated them into the business 
 processes built into the SAP ERP software it had selected. To ensure it obtained 
the maximum benefits from the enterprise software, Tasty Baking Company 
deliberately planned for customizing less than 5 percent of the  system and 
made very few changes to the SAP software itself. It used as many tools and

features that were already built into the SAP software as it could. SAP has more 
than 3,000 configuration tables for its enterprise software. 
Leading enterprise software vendors include SAP, Oracle, IBM, Infor Global 
Solutions, and Microsoft. There are versions of enterprise  software  packages 
designed for small and medium-sized businesses and on-demand versions, 
including software services running in the cloud (see Section 9.4).
BUSINESS VALUE OF ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS
Enterprise systems provide value both by increasing operational efficiency and 
by  providing firmwide information to help managers make better decisions. 
Large companies with many operating units in different locations have used 
enterprise systems to enforce standard  practices and data so that everyone does 
business the same way worldwide.
Coca-Cola, for instance, implemented a SAP enterprise system to standardize 
and  coordinate important business processes in 200 countries. Lack of  standard, 
company-wide business processes prevented the company from leveraging its 
worldwide buying power to obtain lower prices for raw materials and from 
reacting rapidly to market changes. 
Enterprise systems help firms respond rapidly to customer requests for 
 information or  products. Because the system integrates order, manufacturing, 
and delivery data,  manufacturing is better informed about producing only what 
customers have ordered, procuring exactly the right amount of components or 
raw materials to fill actual orders, staging production, and minimizing the time 
that components or finished products are in inventory.
Alcoa, the world’s leading producer of aluminum and aluminum products 
with  operations spanning 31 countries and over 200 locations, had initially been 
organized around lines of  business, each of which had its own set of  information 
systems. Many of these systems were redundant and inefficient. Alcoa’s costs 
for executing requisition-to-pay and financial processes were much higher and 
its cycle times were longer than those of other companies in its industry. (Cycle 
time refers to the total elapsed time from the beginning to the end of a process.) 
The company could not operate as a single worldwide entity. 
After implementing enterprise software from Oracle, Alcoa eliminated many 
 redundant processes and systems. The enterprise system helped Alcoa reduce 
requisition-to-pay cycle time by verifying receipt of goods and automatically 
generating receipts for payment. Alcoa’s accounts payable transaction process-
ing dropped 89 percent. Alcoa was able to  centralize financial and procurement 
activities, which helped the  company reduce nearly 20 percent of its worldwide 
costs.
Enterprise systems provide much valuable information for improving 
 management  decision making. Corporate headquarters has access to up-to-
the-minute data on sales, inventory, and production, and uses this informa-
tion to create more accurate sales and  production forecasts. Enterprise  software 
includes analytical tools for using data captured by the system to evaluate 
 overall organizational performance. Enterprise system data have common 
 standardized definitions and formats that are accepted by the entire organiza-
tion. Performance figures mean the same thing across the company. Enterprise 
systems allow senior management to easily find out at any moment how a 
 particular organizational unit is performing, determine which products are 
most or least profitable, and calculate costs for the company as a whole. 
For example, Alcoa’s enterprise system includes functionality for global 
human resources management that shows correlations between investment in

employee training and quality, measures the company-wide costs of  delivering 
services to employees, and measures the effectiveness of employee  recruitment, 
compensation, and training.
9.2 
HOW DO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 
COORDINATE PLANNING, PRODUCTION, AND 
LOGISTICS WITH SUPPLIERS?
If you manage a small firm that makes a few products or sells a few services, 
chances are you will have a small number of suppliers. You could coordinate 
your supplier orders and  deliveries using a telephone and fax machine. But if 
you manage a firm that produces more complex products and services, then 
you will have hundreds of suppliers, and each of your suppliers will have its 
own set of suppliers. Suddenly, you are in a situation where you will need 
to  coordinate the activities of hundreds or even thousands of other firms in 
order to produce your products and services. Supply chain management (SCM) 
systems, which we introduced in Chapter 2, are an answer to the problems of 
supply chain complexity and scale.
THE SUPPLY CHAIN
A firm’s supply chain is a network of organizations and business processes for 
procuring raw materials, transforming these materials into intermediate and 
finished products, and distributing the finished products to customers. It links 
suppliers, manufacturing plants, distribution centers, retail outlets, and custom-
ers to supply goods and services from source through consumption. Materials, 
 information, and payments flow through the supply chain in both directions. 
Goods start out as raw materials and, as they move through the supply chain, 
are  transformed into intermediate products (also referred to as components or 
parts), and finally, into finished products. The finished products are shipped to 
distribution centers and from there to retailers and customers. Returned items 
flow in the reverse direction from the buyer back to the seller. 
Let’s look at the supply chain for Nike sneakers as an example. Nike designs, 
 markets, and sells sneakers, socks, athletic clothing, and accessories through-
out the world. Its  primary suppliers are contract manufacturers with factories 
in China, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, and other countries. These companies 
fashion Nike’s finished products. 
Nike’s contract suppliers do not manufacture sneakers from scratch. They 
obtain  components for the sneakers—the laces, eyelets, uppers, and soles—
from other  suppliers and then assemble them into finished sneakers. These 
suppliers in turn have their own  suppliers. For example, the suppliers of soles 
have  suppliers for synthetic rubber, suppliers for chemicals used to melt the 
rubber for molding, and suppliers for the molds into which to pour the rubber. 
Suppliers of laces have suppliers for their thread, for dyes, and for the plastic 
lace tips.
Figure 9.2 provides a simplified illustration of Nike’s supply chain for sneak-
ers; it shows the flow of information and materials among suppliers, Nike, 
Nike’s distributors,  retailers, and customers. Nike’s contract manufacturers are 
its primary suppliers. The suppliers of soles, eyelets, uppers, and laces are the 
secondary (Tier 2) suppliers. Suppliers to these  suppliers are the tertiary (Tier 
3) suppliers. 
 
Chapter 9 Achieving Operational Excellence and Customer Intimacy: Enterprise Applications 
385

The upstream portion of the supply chain includes the company’s  suppliers, 
the  suppliers’ suppliers, and the processes for managing relationships with 
them. The  downstream  portion consists of the organizations and processes for 
distributing and delivering products to the final customers. Companies doing 
manufacturing, such as Nike’s contract  suppliers of sneakers, also manage their 
own internal supply chain processes for transforming  materials, components, 
and services furnished by their suppliers into finished products or  intermediate 
products (components or parts) for their customers and for managing materials 
and  inventory.
The supply chain illustrated in Figure 9.2 has been simplified. It only 
shows two  contract manufacturers for sneakers and only the upstream supply 
chain for sneaker soles. Nike has hundreds of contract manufacturers turning 
out  finished sneakers, socks, and  athletic  clothing, each with its own set of 
 suppliers. The upstream portion of Nike’s supply chain would actually comprise 
 thousands of entities. Nike also has numerous distributors and many thousands 
of retail stores where its shoes are sold, so the downstream portion of its supply 
chain is also large and complex.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN 
MANAGEMENT
Inefficiencies in the supply chain, such as parts shortages, underutilized plant 
capacity, excessive finished goods inventory, or high transportation costs, are 
caused by inaccurate or untimely information. For example, manufacturers 
 FIGURE 9.2 
 NIKE’S SUPPLY CHAIN
This figure illustrates the major entities in Nike’s supply chain and the flow of information upstream and downstream to coordinate 
the activities involved in buying, making, and moving a product. Shown here is a simplified supply chain, with the upstream portion 
focusing only on the suppliers for sneakers and sneaker soles.
386 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

may keep too many parts in  inventory because they do not know exactly when 
they will receive their next shipments from their suppliers. Suppliers may 
order too few raw materials because they do not have precise  information on 
demand. These supply chain inefficiencies waste as much as 25 percent of a 
company’s operating costs.
If a manufacturer had perfect information about exactly how many units of 
product customers wanted, when they wanted them, and when they could be 
produced, it would be possible to implement a highly efficient just-in-time 
strategy. Components would arrive exactly at the moment they were needed 
and finished goods would be shipped as they left the assembly line. 
In a supply chain, however, uncertainties arise because many events cannot 
be  foreseen—uncertain product demand, late shipments from suppliers, defec-
tive parts or raw materials, or production process breakdowns. To satisfy 
 customers, manufacturers often deal with such uncertainties and unforeseen 
events by keeping more material or products in inventory than what they think 
they may actually need. The safety stock acts as a buffer for the lack of flexibility 
in the supply chain. Although excess inventory is  expensive, low fill rates are 
also costly because business may be lost from canceled orders.
One recurring problem in supply chain management is the bullwhip 
effect, in which information about the demand for a product gets distorted 
as it passes from one entity to the next across the supply chain. A slight rise 
in demand for an item might cause different members in the supply chain— 
distributors,  manufacturers, suppliers, secondary suppliers (suppliers’ sup-
pliers), and tertiary suppliers (suppliers’ suppliers’ suppliers)—to stockpile 
inventory so each has enough “just in case.” These changes ripple through-
out the supply chain, magnifying what started out as a small change from 
planned orders, creating excess inventory, production, warehousing, and 
shipping costs (see Figure 9.3).
For example, Procter & Gamble (P&G) found it had excessively high inven-
tories of its Pampers disposable diapers at various points along its supply chain 
because of such  distorted information. Although customer purchases in stores 
were fairly stable, orders from  distributors would spike when P&G offered 
aggressive price promotions. Pampers and Pampers’ components accumulated 
in warehouses along the supply chain to meet demand that did not actually 
exist. To eliminate this problem, P&G revised its marketing, sales, and supply 
chain processes and used more accurate demand forecasting. 
The bullwhip effect is tamed by reducing uncertainties about demand and 
supply when all  members of the supply chain have accurate and up-to-date 
information. If all supply chain members share dynamic information about 
inventory levels, schedules, forecasts, and  shipments, they have more precise 
knowledge about how to adjust their sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution 
plans. Supply chain management systems provide the kind of information that 
helps members of the supply chain make better purchasing and scheduling 
decisions.
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE
Supply chain software is classified as either software to help businesses plan 
their  supply chains (supply chain planning) or software to help them execute 
the supply chain steps  (supply chain execution). Supply chain planning 
systems enable the firm to model its  existing  supply chain, generate demand 
forecasts for products, and develop optimal  sourcing and manufacturing plans. 
 
Chapter 9 Achieving Operational Excellence and Customer Intimacy: Enterprise Applications 
387

Such systems help companies make better decisions such as  determining how 
much of a specific product to manufacture in a given time period;  establishing 
inventory levels for raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods; 
determining where to store finished goods; and identifying the transportation 
mode to use for product delivery.
For example, if a large customer places a larger order than usual or changes 
that order on short notice, it can have a widespread impact throughout the 
supply chain. Additional raw materials or a different mix of raw materials 
may need to be ordered from suppliers. Manufacturing may have to change 
job scheduling. A transportation carrier may have to reschedule deliveries. 
Supply chain planning software makes the necessary adjustments to produc-
tion and distribution plans. Information about changes is shared among the 
relevant supply chain members so that their work can be coordinated. One 
of the most important—and complex—supply chain planning functions is 
demand planning, which determines how much product a business needs to 
make to satisfy all of its customers’ demands (see the Interactive Session on 
Management), JDA Software, SAP, and Oracle all offer supply chain manage-
ment solutions. 
 FIGURE 9.3 
 THE BULLWHIP EFFECT
Inaccurate information can cause minor fluctuations in demand for a product to be amplified as one moves further back in the supply 
chain. Minor fluctuations in retail sales for a product can create excess inventory for distributors, manufacturers, and suppliers.

DP WORLD TAKES PORT MANAGEMENT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
DP (Dubai Ports) World has reason to be proud of its 
accomplishment of becoming one of the leading ter-
minal operators in the world. Today, DP World has 
60 terminals across 6 continents, and 11 new termi-
nals are under development. The firm employs an 
international professional team of more than 30,000 
people to serve customers in some of the most 
dynamic economies in the world.
DP World has adopted a customer-centric 
approach to enhancing its customers’ supply chains 
by providing quality, innovative services to effec-
tively manage container, bulk, and other terminal 
cargo. The firm invests heavily in terminal infra-
structures, technologies, and people to best serve its 
customers.
Like other global port and terminal operators, 
DP World helps shippers around the world address 
the often complex and costly challenges of manag-
ing the supply chain. One of the typical problems 
encountered in container terminal operations is 
traffic congestion at port entry points. This conges-
tion is often due to delays introduced by lengthy 
procedures and paper-based logistics. In response, 
DP World has introduced many IT-based solutions to 
enhance terminal capacity utilization. These solu-
tions include the electronic custom release of cargo, 
electronic data interchange (EDI) reporting, twoway 
digital radio communications, and the “e-token” 
advanced booking system.
DP World management wanted to take things a 
step further and decided to make the loading and 
unloading of containers operate on “just in time” 
principles to improve container turnaround. It 
found that radio frequency identification (RFID) 
technology was an effective way of increasing the 
efficiency of truck movements through port access 
gates. Today, DP World uses RFID-enabled auto-
matic gate systems at the port terminals it operates 
in Dubai and Australia. According to Mohammed Al 
Muallem, managing director of DP World UAE, the 
introduction of an automated gate system would 
not only eliminate traffic congestion but would also 
help to eliminate a number of lengthy procedures, 
increasing productivity at the ports, and improving 
customer satisfaction. This will in turn increase the 
turnaround of shipping goods. 
Prior to the RFID deployment, DP World spent 
several months performing proof-of-concept tri-
als involving several competing RFID suppliers. 
Because of the rugged environmental conditions at 
the ports, DP World required that 99.5 percent of 
all tags be read successfully, which was a key chal-
lenge for many vendors. After extensive testing and 
evaluation, DP World selected Identec Solutions, a 
global leader in active wireless tracking solutions, 
as its RFID supplier.
How does the RFID tracking system work? 
Trucks that visit a port terminal are equipped with 
active RFID tags supplied by Identec Solutions 
that are fixed on the rear chassis. As a truck moves 
towards the gate, its unique tag ID number is read 
by an RFID reader, which is integrated with an auto-
mated gate system. At the gate, an optical character 
recognition (OCR) system determines if the truck 
is loaded with a container, identifies the ID number 
of the truck’s container, and reads the truck license 
plate number as a backup identification. The sys-
tem uses the supplied information to automatically 
issue a ticket to the driver that specifies the lane the 
truck should proceed to in order to load or unload 
the container. The system can also automatically 
determine if the truck is on time, which is essential 
information for the efficient pickup and drop off of 
containers. As the truck leaves the gate, the RFID 
tag is read once again, and the driver receives a 
receipt for the completed transaction.
RFID has enabled DP World to increase the pro-
ductivity of container handoffs, speed the entry and 
exit of trucks through terminal gates, and increase 
fuel efficiency. Victoria Rose, regional office proj-
ect coordinator at DP World Sydney maintained 
that RFID would improve gate efficiency through 
improved truck management, reducing queues and 
congestion around gates, and removing the number 
of trucks from public roads by streamlining proce-
dures.
Identec’s RFID-based solution has also enabled 
DP World to improve customer satisfaction by 
enhancing the efficiency of customers’ supply 
chains through smoother, faster, and more effec-
tive delivery of their containers at terminal gates. 
The elimination of lengthy paper transactions and 
manual inspections at gates and the reduction in 
manual data input errors demonstrate DP World’s 
customer-centric approach to delivering a superior 
level of service. The technology also allows trans-

port companies to save time, increase revenues, 
and reduce costs.
DP World’s use of RFID has also helped it to 
tighten security by providing better accuracy on 
inbound and outbound truck movements through 
the terminals. For instance, the system can auto-
matically check whether a truck has a booking and 
whether it is authorized to enter the port.
As a next step, DP World will consider expand-
ing its use of RFID-enabled scanning and tracking 
technology to further optimize supply chain flow. 
In the future, Rose hopes DP World will focus on 
investigating its use within the yard, and how data 
captured can be used.

Supply chain execution systems manage the flow of products through 
 distribution  centers and warehouses to ensure that products are delivered 
to the right locations in the most efficient manner. They track the physical 
status of goods, the management of  materials, warehouse and transportation 
operations, and financial information involving all parties. An example is 
390 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

the Warehouse Management System (WMS) used by Haworth Incorporated. 
Haworth is a world- leading manufacturer and designer of office furniture, with 
distribution centers in four different states. The WMS tracks and  controls the 
flow of finished goods from Haworth’s distribution  centers to its customers. 
Acting on shipping plans for customer orders, the WMS directs the  movement 
of goods based on immediate conditions for space, equipment, inventory, and 
personnel.
GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS AND THE INTERNET
Before the Internet, supply chain coordination was hampered by the difficulties 
of  making information flow smoothly among disparate internal supply chain 
systems for  purchasing, materials management, manufacturing, and distri-
bution. It was also difficult to share  information with external supply chain 
 partners because the systems of  suppliers,  distributors, or logistics providers 
were based on incompatible technology platforms and standards. Enterprise 
and supply chain management systems enhanced with Internet  technology 
supply some of this integration. 
A manager uses a Web interface to tap into suppliers’ systems to determine 
whether inventory and production capabilities match demand for the firm’s 
products. Business  partners use Web-based supply chain management tools to 
collaborate online on  forecasts. Sales representatives access suppliers’ produc-
tion schedules and logistics information to monitor customers’ order status.

More and more companies are entering international markets, outsourcing 
manufacturing operations, and obtaining supplies from other countries as well 
as selling abroad. Their  supply chains extend across multiple countries and 
regions. There are additional  complexities and challenges to managing a global 
supply chain.
Global supply chains typically span greater geographic distances and time 
 differences than domestic supply chains, and have participants from a number 
of different countries. Performance standards may vary from region to region 
or from nation to nation. Supply chain management may need to reflect foreign 
government regulations and cultural  differences. 
The Internet helps companies manage many aspects of their global supply 
chains, including sourcing, transportation, communications, and international 
finance. Today’s apparel industry, for example, relies heavily on outsourcing 
to contract manufacturers in China and other low-wage countries. Apparel 
 companies are starting to use the Web to manage their global supply chain and 
production issues. (Review the discussion of Li & Fung in Chapter 3.)
In addition to contract manufacturing, globalization has encouraged 
 outsourcing warehouse management, transportation management, and 
related  operations to third-party logistics providers, such as UPS Supply Chain 
Solutions and Schneider Logistics Services. These logistics services offer 
 Web-based software to give their customers a  better view of their global supply 
chains. Customers are able to check a secure Web site to monitor inventory and 
 shipments,  helping them run their global supply chains more  efficiently.
Demand-Driven Supply Chains: From Push to Pull 
Manufacturing and Efficient Customer Response
In addition to reducing costs, supply chain management systems facilitate 
 efficient customer response, enabling the workings of the business to be 
 
Chapter 9 Achieving Operational Excellence and Customer Intimacy: Enterprise Applications

driven more by customer demand. (We introduced efficient customer response 
 systems in Chapter 3.)
Earlier supply chain management systems were driven by a push-based model 
(also known as build-to-stock). In a push-based model, production  master sched-
ules are based on forecasts or best guesses of demand for products, and prod-
ucts are “pushed” to  customers. With new flows of information made  possible 
by Web-based tools, supply chain  management more easily  follows a pull-based 
model. In a pull-based model, also known as a demand-driven or build-to-order 
model, actual customer orders or purchases trigger events in the supply chain. 
Transactions to produce and deliver only what  customers have ordered move up 
the supply chain from retailers to distributors to manufacturers and eventually to 
suppliers. Only products to fulfill these orders move back down the supply chain 
to the retailer. Manufacturers use only actual order demand information to drive 
their production schedules and the procurement of components or raw mate-
rials, as illustrated in Figure 9.4.  Walmart’s continuous replenishment system 
described in Chapter 3 is an example of the  pull-based model. 
The Internet and Internet technology make it possible to move from sequen-
tial  supply chains, where information and materials flow sequentially from 
company to company, to concurrent supply chains, where information flows 
in many directions simultaneously among members of a supply chain network. 
Complex supply networks of manufacturers, logistics suppliers,  outsourced 
manufacturers, retailers, and distributors are able to adjust immediately to 
changes in schedules or orders. Ultimately, the Internet could create a “ digital 
logistics nervous system” throughout the supply chain (see Figure 9.5).
BUSINESS VALUE OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEMS
You have just seen how supply chain management systems enable firms to 
streamline both their internal and external supply chain processes and  provide 
management with more  accurate information about what to produce, store, and 
 FIGURE 9.4

sell, not sell what we make.”

move. By implementing a networked and integrated supply chain management 
system, companies match supply to demand, reduce inventory levels, improve 
delivery service, speed product time to market, and use assets more effectively. 
Total supply chain costs represent the majority of operating expenses for 
many  businesses and in some industries approach 75 percent of the total 
 operating budget. Reducing supply chain costs has a major impact on firm 
profitability. 
In addition to reducing costs, supply chain management systems help 
increase sales. If a product is not available when a customer wants it,  customers 
often try to purchase it from someone else. More precise control of the supply 
chain enhances the firm’s ability to have the right product available for  customer 
purchases at the right time.

HOW DO CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS HELP FIRMS ACHIEVE 
CUSTOMER INTIMACY?
You’ve probably heard phrases such as “the customer is always right” or 
“the  customer comes first.” Today these words ring truer than ever. Because 
 competitive advantage based on an innovative new product or service is often 
very short lived, companies are  realizing that their most enduring competi-
tive strength may be their relationships with their customers. Some say that 
the basis of competition has switched from who sells the most products and 
 services to who “owns” the customer, and that customer relationships represent 
a firm’s most valuable asset.

WHAT IS CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT?
What kinds of information would you need to build and nurture strong, 
 long-lasting  relationships with customers? You’d want to know exactly who 
your  customers are, how to contact them, whether they are costly to service 
and sell to, what kinds of products and  services they are interested in, and how 
much money they spend on your company. If you could, you’d want to make 
sure you knew each of your customers well, as if you were  running a small-
town store. And you’d want to make your good customers feel special. 
In a small business operating in a neighborhood, it is possible for business 
owners and managers to really know their customers on a personal, face-to-face 
basis. But in a large business operating on a metropolitan, regional, national, 
or even global basis, it is  impossible to “know your customer” in this intimate 
way. In these kinds of businesses there are too many customers and too many 
 different ways that customers interact with the firm (over the Web, the phone, 
e-mail, blogs, and in person). It becomes especially  difficult to integrate infor-
mation from all theses sources and to deal with the large numbers of customers. 
A large business’s processes for sales, service, and marketing tend to be 
highly  compartmentalized, and these departments do not share much  essential 
customer  information. Some information on a specific customer might be 
stored and organized in terms of that person’s account with the company. Other 
pieces of information about the same customer might be organized by products 
that were purchased. There is no way to  consolidate all of this  information to 
provide a unified view of a customer across the  company. 
This is where customer relationship management systems help. Customer 
 relationship management (CRM) systems, which we introduced in Chapter 2, 
 capture and integrate  customer data from all over the organization,  consolidate 
the data, analyze the data, and then distribute the results to various  systems 
and  customer touch points across the  enterprise. A touch point (also known 
as a contact point) is a method of interaction with the customer, such as 
 telephone, e-mail,  customer service desk, conventional mail, Facebook, Twitter, 
Web site, wireless device, or retail store. Well-designed CRM systems provide a 
single  enterprise view of customers that is  useful for improving both sales and 
 customer service (see Figure 9.6.) 
Good CRM systems provide data and analytical tools for answering  questions 
such as these: What is the value of a particular customer to the firm over his or 
her lifetime? Who are our most loyal customers? It can cost six times more to 
sell to a new  customer than to an existing customer. Who are our most  profitable 
customers? What do these  profitable customers want to buy? Firms use the 
answers to these questions to acquire new customers,  provide better service 
and support to existing customers, customize their  offerings more  precisely to 
customer preferences, and provide ongoing value to retain  profitable customers.
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE
Commercial CRM software packages range from niche tools that perform 
 limited  functions, such as personalizing Web sites for specific custom-
ers, to large-scale  enterprise applications that capture myriad interactions 
with  customers,  analyze them with  sophisticated reporting tools, and link to 
other major  enterprise applications, such as  supply chain management and 
 enterprise  systems. The more comprehensive CRM  packages contain modules 
for  partner relationship management (PRM) and employee relationship 
management (ERM).
394 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

PRM uses many of the same data, tools, and systems as customer relation-
ship  management to enhance collaboration between a company and its selling 
partners. If a  company does not sell directly to customers but rather works 
through distributors or  retailers, PRM helps these channels sell to customers 
directly. It provides a company and its selling partners with the ability to trade 
information and distribute leads and data about customers, integrating lead 
generation, pricing, promotions, order configurations, and availability. It also 
provides a firm with tools to assess its partners’ performances so it can make 
sure its best partners receive the support they need to close more business.
ERM software deals with employee issues that are closely related to CRM, 
such as  setting objectives, employee performance management, performance-
based  compensation, and employee training. Major CRM application software 
vendors include Oracle, SAP, Salesforce.com, and Microsoft Dynamics CRM. 
Customer relationship management systems typically provide software and 
online tools for sales, customer service, and marketing. We briefly describe 
some of these  capabilities.
Sales Force Automation (SFA)
Sales force automation modules in CRM systems help sales staff increase their 
 productivity by focusing sales efforts on the most profitable customers, those 
who are good candidates for sales and services. CRM systems provide sales 
prospect and  contact  information,  product information, product configuration 
capabilities, and sales quote  generation  capabilities. Such software can assemble 
information about a particular  customer’s past purchases to help the salesperson 
make  personalized recommendations. CRM software enables sales, marketing, 
and delivery departments to easily share customer and prospect information. It 
increases each salesperson’s efficiency by reducing the cost per sale as well as 
the cost of acquiring new customers and retaining old ones. CRM software also 
has capabilities for sales forecasting, territory management, and team selling.
 FIGURE 9.6 
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (CRM)
CRM systems examine customers from a multifaceted perspective. These systems use a set of 
 integrated  applications to address all aspects of the customer relationship, including customer service, 
sales, and marketing.
 
Chapter 9 Achieving Operational Excellence and Customer Intimacy: Enterprise Applications 
395

Customer Service
Customer service modules in CRM systems provide information and tools to 
increase the efficiency of call centers, help desks, and customer support staff. 
They have capabilities for assigning and managing customer service requests.
One such capability is an appointment or advice telephone line: When a 
 customer calls a standard phone number, the system routes the call to the 
 correct service  person, who inputs information about that customer into the 
system only once. Once the  customer’s data are in the system, any service 
 representative can handle the customer relationship. Improved access to 
 consistent and accurate customer information helps call centers  handle more 
calls per day and decrease the duration of each call. Thus, call  centers and 
 customer service groups achieve greater productivity, reduced transaction time, 
and higher quality of service at lower cost. The customer is happier because he 
or she spends less time on the phone restating his or her problem to customer 
service  representatives. 
CRM systems may also include Web-based self-service capabilities: The 
 company Web site can be set up to provide inquiring customers personalized 
support information as well as the option to contact customer service staff by 
phone for additional assistance.
Marketing
CRM systems support direct-marketing campaigns by providing capabilities 
for capturing prospect and customer data, for providing product and service 
 information, for qualifying leads for targeted marketing, and for scheduling 
and tracking direct-marketing mailings or e-mail (see Figure 9.7). Marketing 
 modules also include tools for analyzing marketing and customer data, identify-
ing profitable and unprofitable customers, designing products and services to 
 FIGURE 9.7 
HOW CRM SYSTEMS SUPPORT MARKETING

marketing campaigns across multiple channels, including e-mail, direct mail, telephone, the Web, and 
social media.

satisfy specific customer needs and interests, and identifying opportunities for 
cross-selling.
Cross-selling is the marketing of complementary products to customers. 
(For example, in financial services, a customer with a checking account might 
be sold a money market account or a home improvement loan.) CRM tools 
also help firms manage and execute  marketing campaigns at all stages, from 
 planning to determining the rate of success for each campaign.
Figure 9.8 illustrates the most important capabilities for sales, service, and 
marketing processes that would be found in major CRM software products. 
Like enterprise software, this software is business-process driven, incorporating 
 hundreds of business processes thought to represent best practices in each of 
these areas. To achieve maximum benefit, companies need to revise and model 
their business processes to conform to the best-practice business processes in 
the CRM software.
Figure 9.9 illustrates how a best practice for increasing customer loy-
alty through  customer service might be modeled by CRM software. Directly 
 servicing customers  provides firms with opportunities to increase customer 
retention by singling out profitable long-term customers for preferential 
 treatment. CRM  software can assign each customer a score based on that 
 person’s value and  loyalty to the company and provide that information to 
help call centers route each customer’s service request to agents who can best

handle that customer’s needs. The system would automatically provide the 
service agent with a detailed profile of that customer that includes his or her 
score for value and loyalty. The service agent would use this information to 
present special offers or additional service to the customer to  encourage the 
customer to keep  transacting  business with the company. You will find more 
information on other  best-practice  business processes in CRM systems in our 
Learning Tracks.
OPERATIONAL AND ANALYTICAL CRM
All of the applications we have just described support either the operational 
or analytical aspects of customer relationship management. Operational 
CRM includes customer- facing applications, such as tools for sales force 
 automation, call center and customer service  support, and marketing 
 automation. Analytical CRM includes applications that analyze customer 
data generated by operational CRM applications to provide information for 
improving business performance. 
Analytical CRM applications are based on data from operational CRM 
 systems,  customer touch points, and other sources that have been organized in 
data  warehouses or analytic platforms for use in online  analytical  processing 
(OLAP), data mining, and other data analysis  techniques (see Chapter 6). 
Customer data collected by the organization might be combined with data from 
other sources, such as customer lists for direct-marketing  campaigns purchased 
from other  companies or demographic data. Such data are analyzed to identify 
buying patterns, to  create segments for  targeted marketing, and to pinpoint 
profitable and unprofitable  customers (see Figure 9.10 and the Interactive 
Session on Organizations).
Another important output of analytical CRM is the customer’s lifetime value 
to the firm. Customer lifetime value (CLTV) is based on the relationship 
between the revenue  produced by a specific customer, the expenses incurred in 
acquiring and servicing that  customer, and the expected life of the relationship 
between the customer and the company.
398 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

 FIGURE 9.10 ANALYTICAL CRM
Analytical CRM uses a customer data warehouse or analytic platform and tools to analyze customer 
data collected from the firm’s customer touch points and from other sources.
BUSINESS VALUE OF CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
Companies with effective customer relationship management systems 
 realize many benefits, including increased customer satisfaction, reduced 
 direct- marketing costs, more effective marketing, and lower costs for customer 
acquisition and retention. Information from CRM systems increases sales 
 revenue by identifying the most profitable customers and segments for focused 
marketing and cross-selling.
Customer churn is reduced as sales, service, and marketing better respond to 
customer needs. The churn rate measures the number of customers who stop 
using or purchasing products or services from a company. It is an important 
indicator of the growth or decline of a firm’s customer base.

WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES POSED BY 
ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS AND HOW ARE 
ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS TAKING ADVANTAGE 
OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES?
Many firms have implemented enterprise systems and systems for supply 
chain and customer relationship management because they are such power-
ful instruments for achieving operational excellence and enhancing decision 
making. But precisely because they are so powerful in changing the way the 
organization works, they are challenging to implement. Let’s briefly examine 
some of these challenges, as well as new ways of obtaining value from these 
systems.
 
Chapter 9 Achieving Operational Excellence and Customer Intimacy: Enterprise Applications 
399

Salesforce.com is the most successful enterprise-
scale software as a service (SaaS) and the undis-
puted global leader in cloud-based customer rela-
tionship management (CRM) systems. Users can 
access Salesforce applications anywhere through an 
Internet-enabled mobile device or a connected com-
puter. Subscriptions start as low as $15 per user per 
month for the pared-down Group version for small 
sales and marketing teams, with monthly subscrip-
tions for large enterprises ranging from $65–$250 per 
user.
Salesforce has over 100,000 customers. Small 
 businesses find the on-demand model especially 
appealing because there are no large up-front 
 hardware and software investments or lengthy imple-
mentations on corporate computer systems. Fireclay 
Tile, a 37-employee environmentally friendly sus-
tainable tile manufacturer, adopted Salesforce and 
realized multiple benefits. Salesforce’s e-mail and 
Web-to-lead capabilities helped the  company quadru-
ple new sales leads. (Web-to-lead automatically adds 
leads collected from the Web to the company’s mas-
ter database.) A task feature  automatically generates 
specific tasks based on the type of lead ( architect, 
contractor, dealer, or homeowner) and the stage in 
the sales process. The  system automates customer 
service functions including order confirmations, 
follow-up customer satisfaction surveys, and ship-
ping notifications
Salesforce’s social tools enable Fireclay to compete 
successfully against large flooring manufacturers and 
other custom tile producers by providing  superior 
customer service. The company uses Salesforce.com 
to maintain customer profiles, so its sales,  service, 
and production teams have complete  customer 
views as soon as leads come in from the Web. 
Fireclay’s internal social network based on Salesforce 
Chatter helps employees track orders and work 
closely together to meet customer needs. Customer 
 satisfaction has increased by 90 percent.
But Salesforce.com also appeals to large 
 companies. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group adopted 
Salesforce CRM to replace an outmoded Excel appli-
cation that required extensive manual data input to 
compile reports on more than 50 beverage brands 
and to track sales performance against objectives 
in real time. The system now tracks field  activities 
for more than 10,000 accounts, with automated 
reports and dashboards monitoring key perfor-
mance indicators, sales calls, and sales volume. The 
Wall Street Journal, Pitney Bowes, Kimberly-Clark, 
and Starbucks are among Salesforce’s other large 
 corporate CRM users. 
Not to be outdone, established on-premise enter-
prise software companies such as Oracle have 
moved into cloud software services. Pricing starts at 
$70 per month per user. Oracle’s CRM on Demand 
system has many capabilities, including embedded 
tools for forecasting and analytics and interactive 
dashboards. Subscribers are able to use these tools 
to answer questions such as “How efficient is your 
sales effort?” or “How much are your customers 
spending?” 
GRT Hotels & Resorts, a leading hotel group in 
South India with 10 hotels, used Oracle CRM on 
Demand to create a centralized CRM system for all 
of its  properties. The system makes it possible for 
all the hotels in the group to share customer data, 
such as room and rate preferences, and to create 
unified marketing programs that eliminate unnec-
essary price competition between the company’s 
hotels. GRT believes that by making customer 
behavior data available for forecasting sales and by 
creating more targeted marketing campaigns, the 
CRM  system has increased productivity by about 25 
 percent. Managers are able to monitor the  number 
of  customer calls that employees answer each 
month regarding  bookings and general hotel infor-
mation to  identify underperformers. GRT manage-
ment believes that using a hosted CRM service with 
a monthly fee costs 65 percent less than if it had 
purchased and  maintained its own CRM software. 
Moreover, Oracle’s centralized, secure Web-based 
CRM  application ensures that confidential data, such 
as promotion plans, cannot be removed by GRT 
employees when they leave the organization.
While traditional enterprise software vendors 
like Oracle are using their market-leading position 
to penetrate the cloud-based application market, 
newcomers such as SugarCRM have found suc-
cess even among larger companies. Thomas Cook 
France, a subsidiary of the worldwide Thomas Cook 
Group Travel plc, is an example. Thomas Cook 
France has 1,700 employees and is the second largest 
travel  company in France, providing leisure travel 
 programs for groups of 15 travelers. The company

is able to distinguish itself among competitors and 
Internet travel services by providing an outstand-
ing customer experience. Thomas Cook France had 
been using pen and paper to track most of its calls 
and other customer interactions, so its customer data 
were fragmented and redundant, and could not be 
used by management to analyze agent productivity 
and revenue opportunities.
SugarCRM monthly subscriptions range from 
$30–$100 per user. Thomas Cook France found 
SugarCRM to be a user-friendly yet scalable sys-
tem that could be customized, deployed quickly, 
and managed without a large internal information 
systems staff. With the help of Synolia consultants, 
Thomas Cook had its SugarCRM system up and run-
ning within 15 days. Cook’s agents are able to man-

Not all companies experience gains of that mag-
nitude, and cloud computing does have drawbacks. 
Many companies are concerned about maintaining 
control of their data and security. Although cloud 
computing companies are prepared to handle these 
issues, availability assurances and service level 
agreements are not always available. Companies that 
manage their CRM apps with a cloud infrastructure 
have no guarantees that their data will be available at 
all times, or even that the provider will still exist in 
the future, although CRM vendors have taken great 
pains to address these issues.

CA S E  STUDY  Q UE STIONS 
ENTERPRISE APPLICATION CHALLENGES
Promises of dramatic reductions in inventory costs, order-to-delivery time, 
more efficient customer response, and higher product and customer profitabil-
ity make enterprise systems and systems for supply chain management and 
customer relationship management very alluring. But to obtain this value, you 
must clearly understand how your business has to change to use these systems 
effectively.
Enterprise applications involve complex pieces of software that are very 
expensive to purchase and implement. It might take a large Fortune 500 
 company several years to  complete a large-scale implementation of an 
 enterprise system or a system for SCM or CRM. According to a 2014 survey 
 
Chapter 9 Achieving Operational Excellence and Customer Intimacy: Enterprise Applications 
401

of 192 companies conducted by Panorama Consulting Solutions, the average 
cost of an ERP  project was $2.8 million. Projects took a little over 16 months 
to  complete, and 66 percent of the projects delivered 50 percent or less of the 
expected benefits (Panorama, 2014). Changes in project scope and additional 
customization work add to implementation delays and costs.
Enterprise applications require not only deep-seated technological changes 
but also fundamental changes in the way the business operates. Companies 
must make sweeping changes to their business processes to work with the 
 software. Employees must accept new job functions and responsibilities. They 
must learn how to perform a new set of work  activities and understand how the 
information they enter into the system can affect other parts of the company. 
This requires new organizational learning and should also be factored into ERP 
implementation costs.
Supply chain management systems require multiple organizations to share 
 information and business processes. Each participant in the system may have 
to change some of its  processes and the way it uses information to create a 
 system that best serves the supply chain as a whole.
Some firms experienced enormous operating problems and losses when 
they first  implemented enterprise applications because they didn’t under-
stand how much  organizational change was required. For example, Kmart 
had  trouble  getting products to store shelves when it first implemented i2 
Technologies supply chain management software. The i2 software did not 
work well with Kmart’s promotion-driven business model, which  created 
sharp downward spikes in demand for products. Overstock.com’s order track-
ing system went down for a full week when the company replaced a home-
grown system with an Oracle enterprise system. The company rushed to 
implement the software, and did not properly synchronize the Oracle soft-
ware’s process for recording customer refunds with its accounts receivable 
system. These problems contributed to a third-quarter loss of $14.5 million 
that year.
Enterprise applications also introduce “switching costs.” Once you adopt an 
 enterprise application from a single vendor, such as SAP, Oracle, or others, it is 
very costly to switch vendors, and your firm becomes dependent on the vendor 
to upgrade its product and  maintain your installation. 
Enterprise applications are based on organization-wide definitions of data. 
You’ll need to understand exactly how your business uses its data and how the 
data would be organized in a customer relationship management, supply chain 
management, or enterprise system. CRM systems typically require some data 
cleansing work. 
Enterprise software vendors are addressing these problems by offering 
 pared-down  versions of their software and “fast-start” programs for small and 
medium-sized businesses and best-practice guidelines for larger companies. 
Companies are also achieving more flexibility by using cloud applications for 
functions not addressed by the basic enterprise software so that they are not 
constrained by a single “do-it-all” type of system (Drobik and Rayner, 2013).
Companies adopting enterprise applications can also save time and money 
by keeping customizations to a minimum. For example, Kennametal, a $2 
 billion metal-cutting tools company in Pennsylvania, had spent $10 million 
over 13 years maintaining an ERP system with over 6,400 customizations. The 
company has now replaced it with a “plain vanilla,” noncustomized version of 
SAP enterprise software and changed its business processes to conform to the 
software.
402 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

NEXT-GENERATION ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS
Today, enterprise application vendors are delivering more value by  becoming 
more  flexible, Web-enabled mobile, and capable of integration with other 
 systems. Stand-alone  enterprise  systems, customer relationship manage-
ment systems, and supply chain management  systems are becoming a thing 
of the past. The major enterprise software vendors have created what they 
call  enterprise  solutions, enterprise suites, or e-business suites to make their 
 customer relationship  management, supply chain management, and enterprise 
 systems work closely with each other, and link to systems of customers and 
 suppliers. SAP Business Suite, Oracle E-Business Suite, and Microsoft Dynamics 
Suite (aimed at mid-sized companies) are examples, and they now utilize Web 
 services and service-oriented architecture (SOA) (see Chapter 5).
SAP’s next-generation enterprise applications incorporate SOA  standards 
and are able to link SAP’s own applications and Web services developed by 
 independent software  vendors. Oracle also has included SOA and  business 
 process management capabilities in its Fusion middleware products. Businesses 
can use these tools to create platforms for new or improved  business processes 
that integrate information from multiple applications. 
Next-generation enterprise applications also include open source and cloud 
solutions, as well as more functionality available on mobile platforms. Open 
source products such as Compiere, Apache Open for Business (OFBiz), and 
Openbravo do not offer as many capabilities as large commercial enterprise 
software, but are attractive to companies such as small manufacturers because 
of their low cost.
For small- and medium-sized businesses in selected countries, SAP offers 
cloud-based versions of its Business One Cloud and Business ByDesign 
 enterprise software solutions. Cloud-based enterprise systems are also offered 
by smaller vendors such as NetSuite and Plex Systems, but they are not as 
popular as cloud-based CRM products. The undisputed global market leader 
in cloud-based CRM systems is Salesforce.com, with over 100,000 customers. 
Salesforce.com  delivers its service through Internet-connected computers or 
mobile devices and it is widely used by small, medium, and large enterprises. 
As  cloud-based products mature, more  companies will be choosing to run all or 
part of their enterprise applications in the cloud on an as-needed basis.
Social CRM and Business Intelligence
CRM software vendors are enhancing their products to take advantage of social 
 networking technologies. These social enhancements help firms  identify new 
ideas more rapidly, improve team productivity, and deepen interactions with 
customers (see the Chapter 10 ending case study). 
Employees who interact with customers via social networking sites such 
as Facebook and Twitter are often able to provide customer service functions 
much faster and at lower cost than by using telephone conversations or e-mail. 
Customers who are active social media users increasingly want—and expect—
businesses to respond to their questions and  complaints through this channel. 
Social CRM tools enable a business to connect customer conversations and 
 relationships from social networking sites to CRM processes. The leading CRM 
vendors now offer such tools to link data from social networks into their CRM 
software. SAP, Salesforce.com and Oracle CRM products now feature technol-
ogy to monitor, track, and analyze social media activity in Facebook, LinkedIn, 
Twitter, YouTube, and other sites. Business intelligence and analytics software 
vendors such as SAS also have capablities for social media analytics (with

several measures of customer engagement across a variety of social networks), 
along with campaign management tools for testing and optimizing both social 
and traditional Web-based campaigns.
Salesforce.com connected its system for tracking leads in the sales process 
with social-listening and social-media marketing tools, enabling users to tailor 
their social-marketing dollars to core customers and observe the resulting 
 comments. If an ad agency wants to run a targeted Facebook or Twitter ad, 
these capabilities make it possible to aim the ad specifically at people in the 
client’s lead pipeline, who are already being tracked in the CRM system. Users 
will be able to view tweets as they take place in real time and perhaps uncover 
new leads. They can also manage multiple campaigns and compare them all 
to figure out which ones generate the highest click-through rates and cost per 
click.
Business Intelligence in Enterprise Applications Enterprise applica-
tion  vendors have added business intelligence features to help managers obtain 
more meaningful information from the massive amounts of data generated 
by these systems. Included are tools for  flexible reporting, ad hoc analysis, 
 interactive dashboards, what-if scenario analysis, and data  visualization. Rather 
than  requiring users to leave an application and launch separate reporting and 
 analytics tools, the vendors are starting to embed analytics within the context 
of the application itself. They are also offering complementary  stand-alone 
 analytics products, such as SAP BusinessObjects and Oracle Business 
Intelligence Enterprise Edition.
The major enterprise application vendors also offer portions of their products 
that work on mobile handhelds. You can find out more about this topic in our 
Chapter 7 Learning Track on Wireless Applications for Customer Relationship 
Management, Supply Chain Management, and Healthcare.
Review Summary
1. How do enterprise systems help businesses achieve operational excellence?
Enterprise software is based on a suite of integrated software modules and a common central 
 database. The database collects data from and feeds the data into numerous  applications that can 
 support nearly all of an organization’s internal business activities. When new information is entered 
by one process, the information is made available  immediately to other business processes.
Enterprise systems support organizational centralization by enforcing uniform data standards and 
business processes throughout the company and a single unified technology platform. The firmwide 
data generated by enterprise systems helps managers evaluate  organizational performance.
2. How do supply chain management systems coordinate planning, production, and logistics with 
 suppliers?
Supply chain management (SCM) systems automate the flow of information among members of 
the  supply chain so they can use it to make better  decisions about when and how much to purchase, 
 produce, or ship. More accurate information from supply chain management systems reduces 
 uncertainty and the impact of the bullwhip effect.
Supply chain management software includes software for supply chain planning and for supply 
chain execution. Internet technology facilitates the management of global  supply chains by  providing 
the connectivity for organizations in different countries to share supply chain information. Improved 
communication among supply chain  members also facilitates efficient customer response and 
 movement toward a demand-driven model.

3. How do customer relationship management systems help firms achieve customer intimacy?
Customer relationship management (CRM) systems integrate and automate customer-facing  processes in 
sales, marketing, and customer service, providing an  enterprise-wide view of customers. Companies can use 
this customer knowledge when they interact with customers to provide them with better service or to sell 
new products and  services. These systems also identify profitable or  nonprofitable customers or opportuni-
ties to reduce the churn rate.
The major customer relationship management software packages provide capabilities for both  operational 
CRM and analytical CRM. They often include modules for managing  relationships with selling partners 
 (partner relationship management) and for employee  relationship management.
4. What are the challenges posed by enterprise applications and how are enterprise applications taking 
 advantage of new technologies?
Enterprise applications are difficult to implement. They require extensive organizational change, large 
new software investments, and careful assessment of how these systems will enhance  organizational 
 performance. Enterprise applications cannot provide value if they are  implemented atop flawed processes or 
if firms do not know how to use these systems to measure performance improvements. Employees require 
training to prepare for new  procedures and roles. Attention to data management is essential.
Enterprise applications are now more flexible, Web-enabled, and capable of integration with other  systems, 
using Web services and service-oriented architecture (SOA). They also have  open source and on-demand 
 versions and are able to run in cloud infrastructures or on mobile platforms. CRM software has added social 
networking capabilities to enhance  internal collaboration, deepen interactions with customers, and utilize 
data from social  networking sites. Open source, mobile, and cloud versions of some of these products are 
becoming available.

Improving Decision Making: Using Database Software to Manage 
Customer Service Requests
Software skills: Database design; querying and reporting
Business skills: Customer service analysis
9-10  In this exercise, you’ll use database software to develop an application that tracks customer service 
requests and analyzes customer data to identify customers meriting priority treatment.
Prime Service is a large service company that provides maintenance and repair  services for close to 
1,200 commercial businesses in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Its  customers include  businesses 
of all sizes. Customers with service needs call into its  customer service department with requests for 
repairing  heating ducts, broken windows, leaky roofs, broken water pipes, and other  problems. The 
company assigns each request a number and writes down the service request number, the identification 
number of the customer account, the date of the request, the type of equipment requiring repair, and 
a brief  description of the problem. The  service requests are handled on a first-come-first-served basis. 
After the  service work has been completed, Prime calculates the cost of the work, enters the price on 
the service request form, and bills the client. This arrangement treats the most important and profitable 
clients—those with accounts of more than $70,000—no differently from its clients with small accounts. 
Managment would like to find a way to provide its best  customers with better service. Management 
would also like to know which types of service problems occur most frequently so that it can make sure 
it has adequate resources to address them.
Prime Service has a small database with client account information, which can be found in 
MyMISLab™. Use database software to design a solution that would enable Prime’s  customer service rep-
resentatives to identify the most important customers so that they could receive priority service. Your 
solution will require more than one table. Populate your  database with at least 10 service requests. Create 
several reports that would be of interest to management, such as a list of the highest—and lowest—prior-
ity accounts and a report  showing the most frequently occurring service problems. Create a report list-
ing service calls that customer service representatives should respond to first on a specific date.

9-11  In addition to carrying goods from one place to another, some trucking companies provide supply 
chain management services and help their customers manage their information. In this project, you’ll 
use the Web to research and evaluate two of these business services. Investigate the Web sites of two 
companies, UPS Logistics and Schneider Logistics, to see how these companies’ services can be used 
for  supply chain management. Then respond to the following questions: 
• 
What supply chain processes can each of these companies support for their clients?
• 
How can customers use the Web sites of each company to help them with supply chain management?
• 
Compare the supply chain management services provided by these  companies. Which company 
would you select to help your firm manage its supply chain? Why?

WIM Industries: From MRP to ERP
CASE STUDY
W
elding Industries Malaysia (WIM) is 
the only local Malasian company that 
manufactures welding machines for 
commercial use. WIM’s remarkable suc-
cess story, which includes surviving the 1997/8 finan-
cial crisis and the rise of competition from China, is 
attributable to the very effective enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) system it has adopted. In the past, 
WIM was using an materials resource planning (MRP) 
system, but this system, while a large advance over 
paper-based management techniques, nevertheless 
created many problems as the company’s operations 
expanded. MRP systems do not integrated information 
from various divisions within a company, but instead 
automate processes and information within depart-
ments. For WIM this meant there was no platform 
with which to integrate data from different depart-
ments, there was a prevalence of data duplication 
and redundancy, and inconsistent data were supplied 
to managers. In addition to this,  the departments 
within the company were acting as separate entities 
and information was not being shared. The growing 
size of the firm and the corresponding increase in 
the sizes of departments also bogged down the flow 
of information. There were no predefined standards 
for data communications and information was often 
lost. In the absence of an enterprise-wide approach 
to information, WIM had a diffficult time meet-
ing production schedules.  The lack of communica-
tion of vital information resulted in a loss of crucial 
resources; that is, people, material, and machinery. 
Senior management could not obtain a complete view 
of the company as a whole, but instead had to rely on 
piecemeal reports from each division. As Keng Foon 
Leong, General Manager, WIM, explained, “The local 
MRP system had the manufacturing modules, but 
it couldn’t manage huge data. We could not see our 
material movement on our previous system”. Overall 
productivity of the manufacturing process was falling, 
employees were disengaged and customers did not 
return. This set alarm bells ringing.
Based on the problems in their existing system, 
the management at WIM developed  a set of objec-
tives  to guide the development of a new system. 
The objectives included an increase in the visibil-
ity and sharing of all reports on manufacturing; 
improved coordination across functional depart-
ments to increase efficiency; better management of 
procurement and inventory processes; the facilita-
tion of day-to-day management; and the 24x7 avail-
ability of financial information of the entire firm. 
Management also demanded  standardization of data 
formats across the company, and greater accuracy, 
along with remote access and improved security. 
They also decided that the inclusion of best practices 
and other vital information could lead to an increase 
in productivity and greater ownership. 
After careful assessment, WIM decided to hire 
the services of Epicor Software Corporation for their 
ERP needs. Epicor is a software solutions provider to 
various enterprises in the manufacturing, distribu-
tion, retail, and service industries. Epicor has over 40 
years of experience and has more than 20,000 cus-
tomers in over 150 countries. “We reviewed a num-
ber of ERP vendors. We looked at each system and its 
functionality. Epicor stood out with its ability to link 
to our operations and provide the data we needed” 
said Leong. The first step was to put together a func-
tional team comprising project management, IT 
systems managers, and executive management. The 
project management team defined the scope of the 
ERP system, assessed available resources at WIM, 
and budgeted the cost of implementation. The execu-
tive team ensured that the resulting system achieved 
business objectives and strategies, while technical 
expertise and support was provided by the IT team. 
A communication plan was designed to keep each 
individual member informed about current progress 
and the next steps in the plan. This was an essential 
part of change management at WIM. The system was 
implemented using a phased approach, since Epicor 
believes that key functionalities of the system need 
to be implemented in the first phase, followed by less 
major processes in the second phase, and so on.
ERP at WIM has changed the way the firm func-
tions. The role of ERP in managing manufacturing 
processes now extends from procurement all the way 
to consumption. Holistic information on material, 
machinery, and labor, such as the cost structure of 
all raw materials, can now be accurately assessed. 
WIM is now able to utilize its resources to reap 
maximum profits. ERP has also integrated different 
departments at WIM, resulting in increased effi-
ciency in operations at the firm. The manufacturing 
process can now be effectively and minutely planned 
using ERP, through the identification of the tasks 
408 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

and activities underlying each process, and the time 
required to complete them. The start and end times 
of sequences are estimated, and this enables the 
manufacturing process to be carried out smoothly, 
with any delays being immediately flagged up for 
further action, thus minimizing downtime. Better 
planning also facilitates effective monitoring of the 
process. In addition to these positive outcomes, the 
complexity of risk management and issue manage-
ment is reduced thanks to the increased visibility of 
process information.
The implemtation of Epicor’s ERP software has 
helped WIM to scale up its operations. As Leong 
explains, “Epicor provides us with greater visibil-
ity over our material movement and having an 
advanced MRP system within a comprehensive solu-
tion like Epicor is very important to the business.” 
The success of any manufacturing company also 
lies in how inventory is utilized. The software tracks 
and controls all procurement activities, schedules 
production processes, manages costs, and generates 
information that helps WIM to manage its inventory. 
It accurately forecasts the demand for materials and 
provides clear visibility into the lead time of ordered 
material. WIM purchases materials near the time of 
consumption, which leads to a reduction in main-
tenance of inventory levels in the organization. For 
instance, when quantities of a particular raw mate-
rial  exceed the minimum level or the maximum 
level respectively, an email alert is generated by the 
system to notify users, who can then decide whether 
to requision further quantities.
Furthermore, accurate information from all 
departments is recorded on the system, and this 
allows WIM to measure performance against key 
indicators in order to improve the quality of its busi-
ness. As Leong notes, “Epicor has helped us to save 
money because we can make business decisions 
more clearly. We know that the data is accurate and 
the reports are correct. We can call on the Epicor sys-
tem to support our decision-making process and let 
us make decisions faster and justify our spending.”

O
tto Group is the world’s largest mail order company, the second 
largest online retailer in Europe behind Amazon, and the third larg-
est online retailer in the world. In 2013 Otto Group generated €12 
billion in total global revenue, and over €6 billion in online global 
sales, nearly all of which is generated in Europe. By comparison, in 2013 
Amazon had online sales in Europe of €13.6 billion, and total global sales of  
approximately €45 billion.  For perspective, China’s online retail giant, Alibaba, 
generated €116 billion in 2012. Founded in 1949 in Hamburg by Werner Otto as 
a catalog merchant selling 28 styles of shoes, by 2013 Otto Group was com-
posed of 123 companies operating in more than twenty countries, employing 
over 53,000 people. Otto carries more than 1.8 million items and 3600 brands 
on its sites every day.
Though Otto Group originated in Germany, in the 1990s, the company 
began an aggressive acquisition program throughout Europe, North America, 
and China.  You may not recognize the Otto Group corporate name, but you 
will recognize some of its better known brands, including  Crate and Barrel  
(U.S. furnishing), Bombay Co. (U.S. furniture), s.Oliver (German fashion),  
Eddie Bauer (U.S. fashion), Tom Tailor (Europe fashion), and 3 Suisses (French 
mail order fashion). 
Otto Group’s aggressive acquisition growth strategy has created its own set 
of challenges.  Purchasing over 100 companies in the past few decades, it has 
inherited a bewildering array of products, accounting systems, multiple sales 
channels, and market dynamics. Geography added additional complexity for 
managers trying to deliver products to consumers in a timely manner.  
OTTO GROUP: PROFITS FROM PREDICTION
© z_amir/Fotolia

Predicting demand became a major issue.  The traditional retail marketing sys-
tem was sometimes in error: shelves throughout the Otto Group could be filled 
with goods that did not sell, creating large losses.  Other shelves could be empty 
because the traditional system could not respond to hot trends in a timely man-
ner.  In the traditional retail system,  dynamic pricing (lowering prices to clear 
overstock items, or raising prices on really hot fashions) was impossible.  In the 
past, Otto had used various offline regression analysis programs to predict 
demand, but they were often too late and slow to respond to real-time market 
changes.
The Otto Group turned to Big Data and predictive analytics to help it achieve 
real-time market decision making.  It worked with Teradata Inc. (San Diego) to 
create a data warehouse containing literally terabytes of customer data from its 
online and catalog operations in twenty countries.  The Teradata Portfolio for 
Hadoop software provides flexible Big Data storage for firms using SQL and 
non-SQL databases. It allows firms to analyze social media, documents, text, 
images, and other non-structured data.   For instance, when yellow blouses are 
mentioned on thousands of Twitter posts followed by Otto’s customers in 
France, based on prior knowledge of the relationship between Twitter posts and 
its own sales to followers, it may want to expand its inventory of yellow blouses 
in France.  
To analyze and understand its huge collection of customer data, Otto Group 
purchased a software company now named Blue Yonder software, a leading 
provider of forecasting and data pattern recognition, or what is called “predic-
tive analytics.”   Using an artificial intelligence program to recognize patterns in 
very large data sets, Blue Yonder’s NeuroBayes software is used by firms to dis-
cover patterns in data by analyzing up to petabytes of information per second. 
Using predictive analytics and Big Data repositories, Otto Group has been 
able to increase its ability to forecast demand by 40%, and it claims to have 
reaped tens of millions of euros in savings.   Otto calculates annually over one 
billion individual consumer predictions which it aggregates to predict demand 
for its 40,000 online and catalog products.  Leftover merchandise has been 
reduced by 20 percent.  Predicting how many items will be returned has become 
more precise and has helped the company understand why they are returned.  
The firm can use the same systems to engage in dynamic pricing, changing 
prices in accordance with aggregate demand, as well as individual propensities 
to spend. 
Implementing a data-driven approach to marketing has also introduced cul-
tural and organizational challenges. Otto’s experienced merchandisers and buy-
ers have a long history of making correct decisions when it comes to selecting 
products to sell, and the price points that motivate consumers. To ensure pre-
dictive analytics and data-driven decision making is used throughout the firm 
whenever possible, Otto Group created a central business intelligence team.  
This was a major cultural shift within the firm. Time will tell if the central busi-
ness intelligence team can outperform Otto’s human professionals, or if they 
will learn and work together to produce better results.

10.1 WHAT ARE THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF 
E-COMMERCE, DIGITAL MARKETS, AND DIGITAL 
GOODS?
Bought an iTunes track lately, streamed a Netflix movie to your home TV, 
 purchased a book at Amazon, or a diamond at Blue Nile? If so, you’ve engaged 
in e-commerce. In 2014, an  estimated 196 million Americans went shopping 
online, and 163 million purchased  something online as did millions of others 
 worldwide. And although most  purchases still take place through traditional 
channels,  e-commerce  continues to grow rapidly and to  transform the way 
many  companies do  business. In 2014, e-commerce  consumer sales of goods, 
 services, and content will reach 470 billion, about 6.5 percent of all retail sales, 
and they are growing at 12 percent annually (compared to 3.5 percent for 
 traditional  retailers) (eMarketer, 2014a). In just the past two years, e-commerce 
has expanded from the  desktop and home  computer to mobile devices, from an 
isolated activity to a new social  commerce, and from a Fortune 1000  commerce 
with a national audience to local merchants and  consumers whose location is 
known to mobile devices. At the top 100 e-commerce retail sites, more than 
half of online shoppers arrive from their smartphones, although most continue 
to purchase using a PC or tablet. The key words for understanding this new 
 e-commerce in 2014 are “social, mobile, local.” 
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter.  Otto’s primary challenge is understanding and pre-
dicting the demand for thousands of products it sells online and through cata-
logs in twenty countries.  If it could solve this challenge it could make its supply 
chain more effective and responsive, reduce returns, lower overall costs, and 
increase its profit margins.  To solve this challenge Otto turned to new database 
technology and new analytic software for analyzing non-structured customer 
data.  To implement its new approach to demand prediction and buying, it cre-
ated a new organizational unit and retrained employees in how to take advan-
tage of the new technologies.  These results allow the firm to make its supply 
chain more responsive and efficient.
Here are some questions to think about: How did the global nature of Otto’s 
business present problems for the company? How did analyzing big data change 
the way the company ran its business?

E-COMMERCE TODAY
E-commerce refers to the use of the Internet and the Web to transact  business. 
More  formally, e-commerce is about digitally enabled commercial transac-
tions between and among  organizations and individuals. For the most part, 
this means transactions that occur over the Internet and the Web. Commercial 
transactions involve the exchange of value (e.g., money) across organizational 
or individual boundaries in return for products and services. 
E-commerce began in 1995 when one of the first Internet portals, Netscape.
com, accepted the first ads from major corporations and popularized the idea 
that the Web could be used as a new medium for advertising and sales. No 
one  envisioned at the time what would turn out to be an exponential growth 
curve for  e-commerce retail sales, which  doubled and tripled in the early years. 
E-commerce grew at double-digit rates until the recession of 2008–2009 when 
growth slowed to a crawl. In 2009, e-commerce revenues were flat (Figure 10.1), 
not bad considering that traditional retail sales were shrinking by 5 percent 
annually. In fact, e-commerce during the recession was the only stable segment 
in retail. Some online retailers forged ahead at a record pace: Amazon’s 2009 rev-
enues were up 25 percent over 2008 sales. Despite the continuing slow growth 
in 2013, the  number of online buyers increased by 5 percent to 155  million, and 
the number of online retail transactions was up 8 percent. Amazon’s sales grew 
to $74 billion in 2013, up an incredible 24 percent from 2012! 
Mirroring the history of many technological innovations, such as the 
 telephone, radio, and television, the very rapid growth in e-commerce in the 
early years  created a market bubble in e-commerce stocks. Like all bubbles, the 
“dot-com” bubble burst (in March 2001). A large number of e-commerce com-
panies failed during this process. Yet for many others, such as Amazon, eBay, 
Expedia, and Google, the results have been more positive: soaring revenues, 
 FIGURE 10.1  THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE
Retail e-commerce revenues grew 15–25 percent per year until the recession of 2008–2009, when they slowed measurably. In 2014, 
e-commerce revenues are growing again at an estimated 12 percent annually.

fine-tuned  business models that produce profits, and rising stock prices. By 
2006, e-commerce  revenues returned to solid growth, and have continued to be 
the fastest growing form of retail trade in the United States, Europe, and Asia.
• Online consumer sales grew to an estimated $414 billion in 2014, an increase 
of more than 12 percent over 2013 (including travel services and digital 
downloads), with 163 million people purchasing online and an additional 39 
million shopping and gathering information but not purchasing  (eMarketer, 
2014a).
• The number of individuals of all ages online in the United States expanded 
to 251 million in 2014, up from 147 million in 2004. In the world, over 2.8 
 billion people are now connected to the Internet. Growth in the overall 
Internet population has spurred growth in e-commerce (Internet World Stats, 
2014).
• Approximately 90 million households have broadband access to the Internet 
in 2014, representing about 74 percent of all households.
• About 167 million Americans now access the Internet using a smartphone 
such as an iPhone, Android, or BlackBerry. Mobile e-commerce has begun 
a rapid growth based on apps, ringtones, downloaded entertainment, and 
 location-based services. Mobile  commerce will add up to about $84 billion in 
2014 (roughly triple 2010’s revenue). Amazon sold an estimated $11 billion 
in retail goods to mobile users in 2013. In a few years, mobile phones will be 
the most  common Internet access device. Currently half of all mobile phone 
users access the Internet using their phones.
• On an average day, an estimated 212 million adult U.S. Internet users go 
online. About 152 million send e-mail, 152 million use a search engine, and 
117 million get news. Around 124 million use a social network, 62 million 
do online banking, 73 million watch an online video, and 44 million look for 
information on Wikipedia (Pew Internet & American Life Project, 2014).
• B2B e-commerce (use of the Internet for business-to-business commerce and 
 collaboration among business partners) expanded to more than $5.7 trillion. 
Table 10.1 highlights these new e-commerce developments.
THE NEW E-COMMERCE: SOCIAL, MOBILE, LOCAL
One of the biggest changes is the extent to which e-commerce has become more 
social, mobile, and local. Online marketing consisted largely of creating a cor-
porate Web site, buying display ads on Yahoo, purchasing ad words on Google, 
and sending e-mails. The workhorse of online marketing was the  display ad. 
It still is. But it’s increasingly being replaced by video ads which are far more 
effective. Display ads from the very beginning of the Internet were based on 
television ads where brand messages were flashed before millions of users who 
were not expected to respond immediately, ask questions, or make observa-
tions. If the ads did not work, the solution was often to repeat the ad. The 
 primary measure of success was how many “eyeballs” (unique visitors) a Web 
site produced, and how many “impressions” a marketing campaign generated. 
(An impression was one ad shown to one person.) Both of these measures were 
carry overs from the world of television, which measures marketing in terms of 
audience size and ad views. 
From Eyeballs to Conversations
After 2007, all this changed with the rapid growth of Facebook and other social 
sites, the explosive growth of smartphones beginning with Apple iPhone, and 
the growing interest in local marketing. What’s different about the new world of

TABLE 10.1 THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE
BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION
E-commerce remains the fastest growing form of commerce when compared to physical retail stores, 
services, and entertainment.
Social, mobile, and local commerce have become the fastest growing forms of e-commerce.
The first wave of e-commerce transformed the business world of books, music, and air travel. In the 
second wave, nine new industries are facing a similar transformation scenario: marketing and advertising, 
telecommunications, movies, television, jewelry and luxury goods, real estate, online travel, bill payments, 
and software.
The breadth of e-commerce offerings grows, especially in the services economy of social networking, 
travel, entertainment, retail apparel, jewelry, appliances, and home furnishings.
The online demographics of shoppers broaden to match that of ordinary shoppers.
Pure e-commerce business models are refined further to achieve higher levels of profitability, whereas 
traditional retail brands, such as Sears, JCPenney, L.L.Bean, and Walmart, use e-commerce to retain their 
dominant retail positions.
Small businesses and entrepreneurs continue to flood the e-commerce marketplace, often riding on the 
infrastructures created by industry giants, such as Amazon, Apple, and Google, and increasingly taking 
advantage of cloud-based computing resources.
Mobile e-commerce begins to take off in the United States with location-based services and entertainment 
downloads including e-books, movies, music and television shows.
TECHNOLOGY FOUNDATIONS
Wireless Internet connections (Wi-Fi, WiMax, and 3G/4G smartphones) grow rapidly.
Powerful smartphones, and tablet computers, music, Web surfing, and entertainment as well as voice 
communication. Podcasting and streaming take off as mediums for distribution of video, radio, and  
user-generated content.
Mobile devices expand to include Apple Watch, Google Glass, and wearable computers.
The Internet broadband foundation becomes stronger in households and businesses as transmission prices 
fall. More than 89 million households had broadband cable or DSL access to the Internet in 2014, about 
74 percent of all households in the United States (eMarketer, 2014c).
Social networking software and sites such as Facebook, Google +, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others become a 
major new platform for e-commerce, marketing, and advertising. Facebook hits 1.2 billion users 
worldwide, and 151 million in the United States (Facebook, 2014).
New Internet-based models of computing, such as smartphone apps, cloud computing, software as a 
service (SaaS), and Web 2.0 software greatly reduce the cost of e-commerce Web sites.
NEW BUSINESS MODELS EMERGE
More than half the Internet user population have joined an online social network, contribute to social 
bookmarking sites, create blogs, and share photos. Together these sites create a massive online audience 
as large as television that is attractive to marketers. In 2014, social networking accounts for an estimated 
25 percent of online time.
The traditional advertising industry is disrupted as online advertising grows twice as fast as TV and print 
advertising; Google, Yahoo, and Facebook display nearly 1 trillion ads a year.
Social sharing e-commerce sites like Uber and Airbnb extend the the market creator business model to 
new areas.
Newspapers and other traditional media adopt online, interactive models but are losing advertising 
revenues to the online players despite gaining online readers. The New York Times adopts a paywall for its 
online edition and succeeds in capturing 850,000 subscribers. Book publishing thrives because of the 
growth in e-books, and the appeal of traditional books.
Online entertainment business models offering television, movies, music, and games with cooperation 
among the major copyright owners in Hollywood and New York and with Internet distributors like Apple, 
Amazon, Google, YouTube, and Facebook.
418 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

social-mobile-local e-commerce are the dual and related concepts of “conversa-
tions” and “engagement.” Marketing in this new period is based on firms engag-
ing in multiple online conversations with their customers, potential customers, 
and even critics. Your brand is being talked about on the Web and social media 
(that’s the conversation part), and marketing your firm, building and restor-
ing your brands, requires you to locate, identify, and participate in these con-
versations. Social marketing means all things social like listening, discussing, 
interacting, empathizing, and engaging. The emphasis in online marketing has 
shifted from a focus on eyeballs to a focus on participating in customer-oriented 
conversations. In this sense, social marketing is not simply a “new ad channel,” 
but a collection of technology-based tools for communicating with shoppers. 
In the past, firms could tightly control their brand messaging, and lead 
 consumers down a funnel of cues that ended in a purchase. That is not true 
of social marketing. Consumer purchase decisions are increasingly driven by 
the conversations, choices, tastes, and opinions of their social network. Social 
 marketing is all about firms participating in and shaping this social process. 
From the Desktop to the Smartphone
Traditional online marketing (browser-based, search and display ads, e-mail, 
and games) still constitutes the majority (65 percent) of all online market-
ing ($51 billion), but it’s growing much more slowly than social-mobile-local 
 marketing. The marketing dollars are  following customers and shoppers from 
the PC to mobile devices.
Social, mobile, and local e-commerce are connected. As mobile devices 
become more powerful, they are more useful for accessing Facebook and other 
social sites. As mobile devices become more widely adopted, they can be used 
by customers to find local  merchants, and by merchants to alert customers in 
their neighborhood of special offers. 
WHY E-COMMERCE IS DIFFERENT
Why has e-commerce grown so rapidly? The answer lies in the unique nature of 
the Internet and the Web. Simply put, the Internet and e-commerce  technologies 
are much richer and more powerful than previous technology  revolutions like 
radio, television, and the  telephone. Table 10.2 describes the unique features 
of the Internet and Web as a commercial medium. Let’s explore each of these 
unique features in more detail.
Ubiquity
In traditional commerce, a marketplace is a physical place, such as a retail 
store, that you visit to transact business. E-commerce is ubiquitous, meaning 
that it is available just about everywhere, at all times. It makes it possible to 
shop from your desktop, at home, at work, or even from your car, using smart-
phones. The result is called a marketspace—a marketplace extended beyond 
traditional boundaries and removed from a temporal and geographic l ocation.
From a consumer point of view, ubiquity reduces transaction costs—the 
costs of  participating in a market. To transact business, it is no longer  necessary 
that you spend time or money traveling to a market, and much less  mental 
effort is required to make a purchase. 
Global Reach
E-commerce technology permits commercial transactions to cross cultural and 
national boundaries far more conveniently and cost effectively than is true in 
 
Chapter 10 E-commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods 
419

traditional commerce. As a result, the potential market size for  e-commerce 
 merchants is roughly equal to the size of the world’s online population 
 (estimated to be more than 2 billion). 
In contrast, most traditional commerce is local or regional—it involves local 
merchants or national merchants with local outlets. Television, radio  stations 
and newspapers, for instance, are primarily local and regional institutions with 
 limited, but powerful, national networks that can attract a national audience 
but not easily cross national boundaries to a global audience.
Universal Standards
One strikingly unusual feature of e-commerce technologies is that the  technical 
standards of the Internet and, therefore, the technical standards for  conducting 
e-commerce are universal standards. They are shared by all nations around the 
world and enable any computer to link with any other computer regardless of 
the technology platform each is using. In contrast, most traditional commerce 
technologies differ from one nation to the next. For instance, television and 
radio standards differ around the world, as does cellular telephone technology.
TABLE 10.2 EIGHT UNIQUE FEATURES OF E-COMMERCE TECHNOLOGY
E-COMMERCE TECHNOLOGY DIMENSION
BUSINESS SIGNIFICANCE
Ubiquity. Internet/Web technology is 
available everywhere: at work, at home, 
and elsewhere via desktop and mobile 
devices. Mobile devices extend service to 
local areas and merchants.
The marketplace is extended beyond traditional boundaries 
and is removed from a temporal and geographic location. 
“Marketspace” is created; shopping can take place 
anytime, anywhere. Customer convenience is enhanced, 
and shopping costs are reduced.
Global Reach. The technology reaches 
across national boundaries, around the 
earth.
Commerce is enabled across cultural and national 
boundaries seamlessly and without modification. The 
marketspace includes, potentially, billions of consumers and 
millions of businesses worldwide.
Universal Standards. There is one set of 
technology standards, namely Internet 
standards.
With one set of technical standards across the globe, 
disparate computer systems can easily communicate with 
each other.
Richness. Video, audio, and text messages 
are possible.
Video, audio, and text marketing messages are integrated 
into a single marketing message and consumer experience.
Interactivity. The technology works 
through interaction with the user.
Consumers are engaged in a dialog that dynamically 
adjusts the experience to the individual, and makes the 
consumer a co-participant in the process of delivering 
goods to the market.
Information Density. The technology 
reduces information costs and raises 
quality.
Information processing, storage, and communication costs 
drop dramatically, whereas currency, accuracy, and 
timeliness improve greatly. Information becomes plentiful, 
cheap, and more accurate.
Personalization/Customization. The 
technology allows personalized messages 
to be delivered to individuals as well as 
groups.
Personalization of marketing messages and customization 
of products and services are based on individual 
characteristics.
Social Technology. The technology 
supports content generation and social 
networking.
New Internet social and business models enable user 
content creation and distribution, and support social 
networks.
420 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

The universal technical standards of the Internet and e-commerce greatly 
lower market entry costs—the cost merchants must pay simply to bring their 
goods to market. At the same time, for consumers, universal standards reduce 
search costs—the effort required to find suitable products.
Richness
Information richness refers to the complexity and content of a message. 
Traditional  markets, national sales forces, and small retail stores have great 
richness: They are able to provide personal, face-to-face service using aural and 
visual cues when making a sale. The richness of traditional markets makes 
them powerful selling or commercial environments. Prior to the develop-
ment of the Web, there was a trade-off between richness and reach: The larger 
the audience reached, the less rich the message. The Web makes it possible 
to deliver rich messages with text, audio, and video simultaneously to large 
 numbers of people.
Interactivity
Unlike any of the commercial technologies of the twentieth century, with the 
possible exception of the telephone, e-commerce technologies are interac-
tive, meaning they allow for two-way communication between merchant and 
 consumer. Television, for instance, cannot ask viewers any questions or enter 
into conversations with them, and it cannot request that customer informa-
tion be entered into a form. In contrast, all of these activities are possible on 
an e-commerce Web site. Interactivity allows an online merchant to engage a 
 consumer in ways similar to a face-to-face experience but on a massive, global 
scale.
Information Density
The Internet and the Web vastly increase information density—the total 
amount and  quality of information available to all market participants, 
 consumers, and merchants alike. E-commerce technologies reduce information 
collection, storage, processing, and  communication costs while greatly increas-
ing the currency, accuracy, and timeliness of information. 
Information density in e-commerce markets make prices and costs more 
transparent. Price transparency refers to the ease with which consumers 
can find out the variety of prices in a market; cost transparency refers to the 
 ability of consumers to discover the actual costs merchants pay for products. 
There are advantages for merchants as well. Online merchants can  discover 
much more about consumers than in the past. This allows merchants to 
 segment the market into groups that are willing to pay different prices and 
 permits the merchants to engage in price  discrimination—selling the same 
goods, or nearly the same goods, to different targeted groups at different prices. 
For instance, an online merchant can discover a  consumer’s avid interest in 
expensive, exotic vacations and then pitch high-end vacation plans to that 
 consumer at a premium price, knowing this person is willing to pay extra for 
such a  vacation. At the same time, the online merchant can pitch the same 
vacation plan at a lower price to a more price-sensitive consumer. Information 
density also helps merchants differentiate their products in terms of cost, 
brand, and quality.
Personalization/Customization
E-commerce technologies permit personalization: Merchants can target 
their marketing messages to specific individuals by adjusting the message 
 
Chapter 10 E-commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods 
421

to a  person’s clickstream behavior, name, interests, and past purchases. The 
technology also permits customization—changing the delivered product or 
service based on a user’s preferences or prior behavior. Given the interactive 
nature of e-commerce  technology, much information about the consumer can 
be gathered in the  marketplace at the moment of purchase. With the increase 
in information  density, a great deal of information about the consumer’s past 
purchases and behavior can be stored and used by online merchants. 
The result is a level of personalization and customization unthinkable with 
traditional commerce technologies. For instance, you may be able to shape 
what you see on television by selecting a channel, but you cannot change the 
content of the channel you have chosen. In contrast, the Wall Street Journal 
Online allows you to select the type of news stories you want to see first and 
gives you the opportunity to be alerted when certain events happen.
Social Technology: User Content Generation and Social 
Networking
In contrast to previous technologies, the Internet and e-commerce technologies 
have evolved to be much more social by allowing users to create and share with 
their personal friends (and a larger worldwide community) content in the form 
of text, videos, music, or  photos. Using these forms of communication, users 
are able to create new social networks and strengthen existing ones.
All previous mass media in modern history, including the printing press, use 
a  broadcast model (one-to-many) where content is created in a central location 
by experts  (professional writers, editors, directors, and producers) and  audiences 
are concentrated in huge numbers to consume a standardized  product. The 
new Internet and e-commerce empower users to create and  distribute content 
on a large scale, and permit users to program their own  content consumption. 
The Internet provides a unique many-to-many model of mass  communications.
KEY CONCEPTS IN E-COMMERCE: DIGITAL MARKETS 
AND DIGITAL GOODS IN A GLOBAL MARKETPLACE
The location, timing, and revenue models of business are based in some part 
on the cost and distribution of information. The Internet has created a digital 
 marketplace where millions of people all over the world are able to exchange 
massive amounts of information directly, instantly, and for free. As a result, the 
Internet has changed the way companies conduct business and increased their 
global reach. 
The Internet reduces information asymmetry. An information asymmetry 
exists when one party in a transaction has more information that is impor-
tant for the transaction than the other party. That information helps determine 
their relative bargaining power. In digital markets, consumers and suppliers 
can “see” the prices being charged for goods, and in that sense digital markets 
are said to be more “transparent” than traditional markets.
For example, before auto retailing sites appeared on the Web, there was a 
 significant information asymmetry between auto dealers and customers. 
Only the auto dealers knew the manufacturers’ prices, and it was difficult 
for  consumers to shop around for the best price. Auto dealers’ profit  margins 
depended on this asymmetry of information. Today’s consumers have access 
to a legion of Web sites providing competitive pricing information, and 
 three-fourths of U.S. auto buyers use the Internet to shop around for the best 
deal. Thus, the Web has reduced the information asymmetry surrounding an 
422 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

auto purchase. The Internet has also helped businesses seeking to purchase 
from other businesses reduce  information asymmetries and locate better prices 
and terms. 
Digital markets are very flexible and efficient because they operate with 
reduced search and transaction costs, lower menu costs (merchants’ costs of 
changing prices), greater price discrimination, and the ability to change prices 
dynamically based on market conditions. In dynamic pricing, the price of a 
product varies depending on the demand characteristics of the customer or 
the supply situation of the seller. For instance, online retailers from Amazon 
to Walmart change prices on many products based on time of day, demand 
for the product, and users’ prior visits to their sites. Using big data analytics, 
some online firms can adjust prices at the individual level based on behavioral 
 targeting parameters, such as whether the consumer is a price haggler (who 
will receive a lower price offer) versus a person who accepts offered prices and 
does not search for lower prices. Prices can also vary by zip code, with higher 
prices set for poor sections of a community.
These new digital markets may either reduce or increase switching costs, 
depending on the nature of the product or service being sold, and they may 
cause some extra delay in gratification. Unlike a physical market, you can’t 
immediately consume a product such as clothing purchased over the Web 
(although immediate consumption is possible with digital music downloads 
and other digital products.) 
Digital markets provide many opportunities to sell directly to the consumer, 
 bypassing intermediaries, such as distributors or retail outlets. Eliminating 
intermediaries in the  distribution channel can significantly lower purchase 
transaction costs. To pay for all the steps in a traditional distribution channel, 
a product may have to be priced as high as 135 percent of its original cost to 
manufacture. 
Figure 10.2 illustrates how much savings result from eliminating each of these 
 layers in the distribution process. By selling directly to consumers or reducing 
the number of  intermediaries, companies are able to raise profits while charging 
lower prices. The removal of organizations or business process layers respon-
sible for intermediary steps in a value chain is called disintermediation.
 FIGURE 10.2 THE BENEFITS OF DISINTERMEDIATION TO THE CONSUMER
The typical distribution channel has several intermediary layers, each of which adds to the final cost of 
a product, such as a sweater. Removing layers lowers the final cost to the customer.
 
Chapter 10 E-commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods 
423

Disintermediation is affecting the market for services. Airlines and hotels 
operating their own reservation sites online earn more per ticket because they 
have eliminated travel agents as intermediaries. Table 10.3 summarizes the 
 differences between digital markets and traditional markets.
Digital Goods
The Internet digital marketplace has greatly expanded sales of digital goods. 
Digital goods are goods that can be delivered over a digital network. Music 
tracks, video, Hollywood  movies, software, newspapers, magazines, and books 
can all be expressed, stored, delivered, and sold as purely digital products. 
For the most part, digital goods are “intellectual property” which is defined as 
“works of the mind.” Intellectual property is protected from misappropriation 
by copyright, patent, and trade secret laws (see Chapter 4). Today, all these 
products are delivered as digital streams or  downloads, while their physical 
counterparts decline in sales. 
In general, for digital goods, the marginal cost of producing another unit is 
about zero (it costs nothing to make a copy of a music file). However, the cost 
of producing the  original first unit is relatively high—in fact, it is nearly the 
total cost of the product because there are few other costs of inventory and 
distribution. Costs of delivery over the Internet are very low, marketing costs 
often remain the same, and pricing can be highly variable. (On the Internet, 
the merchant can change prices as often as desired because of low menu costs.) 
The impact of the Internet on the market for these kinds of digital goods is 
nothing short of revolutionary, and we see the results around us every day. 
Businesses dependent on  physical products for sales—such as bookstores, 
music stores, book publishers, music labels, and film studios—face the possibil-
ity of declining sales and even destruction of their  businesses. Newspapers and 
magazines subscriptions to hard copies are declining, while online readership 
and subscriptions are expanding. 
Total record label industry revenues have fallen from $14 billion in 1999, to 
$7.1 billion estimated in 2013, a drop of 50 percent, due almost entirely to the 
decline in CD album sales, and the growth of digital music services (both legal

and illegal music piracy). On the plus side, the Apple iTunes Store has sold 35 
billion songs for 99 cents each since opening in 2003, providing the industry 
with a digital distribution model that has restored some of the revenues lost to 
digital music channels. Since iTunes, illegal downloading has been cut in half, 
and legitimate online music sales are estimated to be approximately $4 billion 
in 2014. As cloud streaming services expand, illegal downloading will decline 
further. In that sense, Apple, along with other Internet distributors, saved the 
record labels from extinction. In 2013, digital music sales accounted for over 64 
percent of all music revenues. Yet the music labels make only about 32 cents 
from a single track download and only .003 cents for a streamed track (with the 
hope that sales of tracks or CDs will result).
Hollywood has not been similarly disrupted by digital distribution platforms, 
in part because it is more difficult to download high-quality, pirated copies of 
full-length  movies. To avoid the fate of the music industry, Hollywood has 
struck lucrative distribution deals with Netflix, Google, Amazon, and Apple, 
making it convenient to download and pay for high quality movies. Content is 
still king. Google and Apple may own the pipes and the devices, but without 
compelling content, they are not very profitable. Nevertheless, these arrange-
ments are not enough to  compensate entirely for the loss in DVD sales, 
which fell 50 percent from 2006 to 2013, although this is  changing rapidly 
as the online distributors like Netflix pay billions for high-quality Hollywood 
 content. In 2014, for the first time, consumers will view more and pay more 
for Web-based movie downloads, rentals, and streams than for DVDs or 
related  physical products. As with television, the demand for feature-length 
Hollywood movies appears to be expanding in part because of the growth of 
smartphones and tablets making it easier to watch movies in more locations. 
In addition, the surprising resurgence of music videos, led by the Web site 
VEVO, is attracting millions of younger viewers on smartphones and tablets. 
Online movies began a growth spurt in 2010 as broadband services spread 
throughout the country. In 2011, movie viewing doubled in a single year. 
In 2014, about 73 million Internet users are expected to view movies, about 
 one-third of the adult Internet audience. While this rapid growth will not 
 continue forever, there is little doubt that the Internet is  becoming a movie 
distribution and television channel that rivals cable television, and someday 
may replace cable television entirely. Table 10.4 describes digital goods and 
how they differ from  traditional physical goods.

10.2 WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL E-COMMERCE 
BUSINESS AND REVENUE MODELS?
E-commerce has grown from a few advertisements on early Web portals in 1995 
to over 9 percent of all retail sales in 2014 (an estimated $470 billion),  surpassing 
the mail order  catalog business. E-commerce is a fascinating  combination of 
business models and new  information technologies. Let’s start with a basic 
understanding of the types of e- commerce, and then describe e-commerce 
 business and revenue models.
TYPES OF E-COMMERCE
There are many ways to classify electronic commerce transactions—one is by 
looking at the nature of the participants. The three major electronic commerce 
categories are business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce, business-to-business 
(B2B) e-commerce, and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce.
• Business-to-consumer (B2C) electronic commerce involves retailing prod-
ucts and  services to individual shoppers. BarnesandNoble.com, which sells 
books, software, and music to individual consumers, is an example of B2C 
e-commerce.
• Business-to-business (B2B) electronic commerce involves sales of goods 
and  services among businesses. ChemConnect’s Web site for buying and 
 selling chemicals and  plastics is an example of B2B e-commerce.
• Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) electronic commerce involves consumers 
 selling directly to consumers. For example, eBay, the giant Web auction site, 
enables people to sell their goods to other consumers by auctioning their 
merchandise off to the  highest bidder, or for a fixed price. Craigslist is the 
most widely used platform used by  consumers to buy from and sell directly 
to others.
Another way of classifying electronic commerce transactions is in terms of the 
 platforms used by participants in a transaction. Until recently, most  e-commerce 
 transactions took place using a personal computer connected to the Internet over 
wired networks. Several  wireless mobile alternatives have emerged:  smartphones, 
tablet computers like iPads,  dedicated  e-readers like the Kindle, and smartphones 
and small tablet  computers using Wi-Fi wireless networks. The use of handheld 
wireless devices for  purchasing goods and services from any location is termed 
mobile  commerce or  m-commerce. Both  business-to-business and business-
to- consumer  e-commerce  transactions can take place using  m-commerce 
 technology, which we discuss in detail in Section 10.3.
E-COMMERCE BUSINESS MODELS
Changes in the economics of information described earlier have created the 
conditions for entirely new business models to appear, while destroying older 
business models. Table 10.5 describes some of the most important Internet 
 business models that have emerged. All, in one way or another, use the Internet 
to add extra value to existing products and services or to provide the foundation 
for new products and services.
Portal
Portals are gateways to the Web, and are often defined as those sites which users 
set as their home page. Some definitions of a portal include search engines 
426 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

like Google and Bing even if few make these sites their home page. Portals 
such as Yahoo, Facebook, MSN, and AOL offer powerful Web search tools as 
well as an integrated package of content and services, such as news, e-mail, 
instant  messaging, maps, calendars, shopping, music downloads, video stream-
ing, and more, all in one place. Initially, portals were  primarily “gateways” to 
the Internet. Today, however, the portal  business model provides a destination 
site where users start their Web  searching and linger to read news, find enter-
tainment, meet other people, and, of course, be exposed to advertising which 
provides the revenues to support the portal. Portals generate revenue primarily 
by attracting very large audiences, charging advertisers for display ad place-
ment (similar to traditional newspapers), collecting referral fees for steering 
customers to other sites, and  charging for premium  services. In 2014, portals 
(not including Google or Bing) generated an  estimated $14.2 billion in display 
ad revenues. For comparison, search ads generated $13.8 billion, and video ads 
generated $4.5 billion. Although there are hundreds of portal/search engine 
sites, the top four portals (Yahoo, Facebook, MSN, and AOL) gather more than 
95 percent of the Internet portal traffic because of their superior brand recogni-
tion (comScore, 2014a; eMarketer, 2014b).
E-tailer
Online retail stores, often called e-tailers, come in all sizes, from giant Amazon 
with 2013 revenues of more than $74.5 billion, to tiny local stores that have Web 
sites. An e-tailer is  similar to the typical bricks-and-mortar storefront, except 
that customers only need to  connect to the Internet to check their inventory

and place an order. Altogether, online retail will  generate about $304 billion 
in  revenues for 2014. The value proposition of e-tailers is to provide conve-
nient, low-cost shopping 24/7, offering large selections and consumer choice. 
Some e-tailers, such as Walmart.com or Staples.com, referred to as “bricks- 
and-clicks,” are subsidiaries or divisions of existing physical stores and carry 
the same  products. Others, however, operate only in the virtual world, without 
any ties to physical locations. Amazon, BlueNile.com, and Drugstore.com are 
examples of this type of e-tailer. Several other  variations of e-tailers—such as 
online versions of direct mail catalogs, online malls, and manufacturer-direct 
online sales—also exist. 
Content Provider 
While e-commerce began as a retail product channel, it has increasingly turned 
into a global content channel. “Content” is defined broadly to include all forms 
of intellectual property. Intellectual property refers to all forms of human 
expression that can be put into a tangible medium such as text, CDs, or DVDs, 
or stored on any digital (or other) media, including the Web. Content  providers 
distribute information content—such as digital video, music, photos, text, 
and artwork—over the Web. The value proposition of online content provid-
ers is that consumers can conveniently find a wide range of content online 
and  purchase this content inexpensively, to be played or viewed on multiple 
 computer devices or smartphones.
Providers do not have to be the creators of the content (although sometimes 
they are, like Disney.com), and are more likely to be Internet-based distribu-
tors of content produced and created by others. For example, Apple sells music 
tracks at its iTunes Store, but it does not create or commission new music. 
The phenomenal popularity of the iTunes Store, and Apple’s Internet- 
connected devices like the iPhone, iPod, and iPad, have enabled new forms 
of digital content delivery from podcasting to mobile streaming. Podcasting 
is a method of publishing audio or video  broadcasts via the Internet, allowing 
 subscribing users to download audio or video files onto their personal  computers 
or portable music players. Streaming is a publishing method for music and 
video files that flows a continuous stream of content to a user’s device without 
being stored locally on the device. 
Estimates vary, but total online media is the fastest  growing  segment within 
 e-commerce, growing at an estimated 20  percent annual rate.
Transaction Broker
Sites that process transactions for consumers normally handled in person, by 
phone, or by mail are transaction brokers. The largest industries using this 
model are financial services and travel services. The online transaction  broker’s 
primary value propositions are savings of money and time, as well as providing 
an extraordinary inventory of financial products and travel packages, in a single 
location. Online stock brokers and travel booking services charge fees that are 
considerably less than traditional versions of these services. Fidelity Financial 
Services, and Expedia, are the largest online financial and travel service firms 
based on a transaction broker model.
Market Creator
Market creators build a digital environment in which buyers and sellers can 
meet,  display products, search for products, and establish prices. The value 
proposition of online market creators is that they provide a platform where 
 sellers can easily display their wares and where purchasers can buy directly 
428 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

from sellers. Online auction markets like eBay and Priceline are good  examples 
of the market creator business model. Another example is Amazon’s Merchants 
platform (and similar programs at eBay) where  merchants are allowed to set 
up stores on Amazon’s Web site and sell goods at fixed prices to consumers. 
This is reminiscent of open air markets where the market creator operates a 
facility (a town square) where merchants and consumers meet. The so-called 
sharing economy, and Web sites like Uber and Airbnb, is based on the idea 
of a market creator building a digital platform where supply meets demand, 
e.g. spare auto capacity finds individuals who want transportation. Uber and 
Airbnb are clearly not sharing anything (sharing does not involve a transfer of 
cash), but the moniker is popular nevertheless. Crowdsource funding markets 
like Kickstarter.com and Mosaic Inc. bring together private equity investors and 
entrepreneurs in a funding  marketplace (Cardwell, 2013). Both are examples of 
B2B financial market places.
Service Provider
While e-tailers sell products online, service providers offer services online. 
There’s been an explosion in online services. Web 2.0 applications, photo 
 sharing, and online sites for data backup and storage all use a service provider 
business model. Software is no longer a  physical product with a CD in a box, 
but increasingly software as a service (SaaS) that you subscribe to online rather 
than purchase from a retailer, or an app that you download. Google has led the 
way in  developing online software service applications such as Google Apps, 
Google Sites, Gmail, and online data storage services. Salesforce.com is a major 
 provider of cloud-based software for customer management.
Community Provider (Social Networks)
Community providers are sites that create a digital online environment where 
people with similar interests can transact (buy and sell goods); share interests, 
photos, videos;  communicate with like-minded people; receive  interest-related 
information; and even play out fantasies by adopting online personalities called 
avatars. The social networking sites Facebook, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn, and 
Twitter; online communities such as  iVillage; and hundreds of other smaller, 
niche sites such as Doostang and Sportsvite all offer users  community-building 
tools and services. Social networking sites have been the fastest  growing Web 
sites in recent years, often doubling their audience size in a year. 
E-COMMERCE REVENUE MODELS
A firm’s revenue model describes how the firm will earn revenue, generate 
profits, and produce a superior return on investment. Although there are many 
different e-commerce revenue models that have been developed, most compa-
nies rely on one, or some combination, of the following six revenue models: 
advertising, sales, subscription, free/freemium, transaction fee, and affiliate.
Advertising Revenue Model
In the advertising revenue model, a Web site generates revenue by  attracting 
a large  audience of visitors who can then be exposed to advertisements. The 
advertising model is the most widely used revenue model in e-commerce, and 
arguably, without  advertising  revenues, the Web would be a vastly  different 
experience from what it is now. Content on the Web—everything from news to 
videos and opinions—is “free” to visitors because  advertisers pay the  production 
and distribution costs in return for the right to expose  visitors to ads. Companies 
 
Chapter 10 E-commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods

will spend an estimated $51 billion on online advertising in 2014, (in the form 
of a paid message on a Web site, paid search listing, video, app, game, or other 
online medium, such as instant messaging). About $18 billion of this will 
involve spending for mobile ads, the fastest growing ad platform. In the last five 
years, advertisers have increased online spending and cut outlays on traditional 
channels such as radio and newspapers. In 2014, online advertising will grow 
at 18  percent and constitute about 28 percent of all advertising in the United 
States. Television advertising has also expanded along with online advertising 
revenues and remains the largest advertising platform with about $68 billion in 
ad revenues in 2014 (eMarketer, 2014b).
Web sites with the largest viewership or that attract a highly specialized, 
 differentiated viewership and are able to retain user attention (“stickiness”) are 
able to charge higher advertising rates. Yahoo, for instance, derives nearly all 
its revenue from display ads  (banner ads), and video ads, and to a lesser extent 
search engine text ads. Ninety-five percent of Google’s  revenue derives from 
 advertising, including selling keywords (AdWord), selling ad spaces (AdSense), 
and selling display ad spaces to advertisers (DoubleClick). Facebook will  display 
one-third of the trillion display ads shown on all sites in 2014. Facebook’s users 
spend an  average of over 6 hours a week on the site, far longer than any of the 
other  portal sites. 
Sales Revenue Model
In the sales revenue model, companies derive revenue by selling goods, 
 information, or services to customers. Companies such as Amazon (which 
sells books, music, and other products), LLBean.com, and Gap.com, all have 
sales revenue models. Content  providers make money by charging for down-
loads of entire files such as music tracks (iTunes Store) or books or for down-
loading music and/or video streams (Hulu.com TV shows). Apple has pio-
neered and strengthened the acceptance of micropayments. Micropayment 
 systems provide content providers with a cost-effective method for process-
ing high  volumes of very small monetary transactions (anywhere from 25 
cents to $5.00 per transaction). The  largest micropayment system on the 
Web is Apple’s iTunes Store, which has more than 500 million credit custom-
ers who frequently  purchase individual music tracks for 99 cents. There is 
a Learning Track with more detail on micropayment and other e-commerce 
payment  systems, including Bitcoin.
Subscription Revenue Model
In the subscription revenue model, a Web site offering content or services 
charges a  subscription fee for access to some or all of its offerings on an  ongoing 
basis. Content  providers often use this revenue model. For instance, the online 
version of Consumer Reports provides access to premium content, such as 
detailed ratings, reviews, and recommendations, only to subscribers, who have 
a choice of paying a $6.95 monthly subscription fee or a $30.00 annual fee. 
Netflix is one of the most successful subscriber sites with more that 44  million 
customers by the end of 2013. The New York Times has about 1.1 million 
online paid subscribers, and the Wall Street Journal about 900,000 in 2014. To 
be successful, the subscription model requires that the content be perceived as 
having high added value, differentiated, and not readily available elsewhere nor 
easily replicated. Companies successfully offering content or services online 
on a subscription basis include Match.com and eHarmony (dating services), 
Ancestry.com and Genealogy.com (genealogy research), Microsoft’s Xbox Live, 
and Pandora.com (music). 
430 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

Free/Freemium Revenue Model
In the free/freemium revenue model, firms offer basic services or  content 
for free, while charging a premium for advanced or special features. For 
example, Google offers free  applications but charges for premium services. 
Pandora, the subscription radio  service, offers a free service with limited 
play time and advertising, and a  premium service with unlimited play (see 
the Interactive Session on Organizations). The Flickr photo-sharing service 
offers free basic services for sharing photos with friends and family, and also 
sells a $24.95 “premium” package that provides users unlimited  storage, high-
definition video storage and playback, and freedom from  display advertis-
ing. Spotify music service also uses a fremium business model. The idea is 
to attract very large audiences with free services, and then to  convert some 
of this  audience to pay a subscription for premium services. One problem 
with this model is  converting  people from being “free loaders” into paying 
 customers. “Free” can be a  powerful model for losing money. None of the 
fremium music streaming sites have earned a profit to date. In fact they are 
finding the free service with ad revenue is more profitable than the paid sub-
scriber part of their business. 
Transaction Fee Revenue Model
In the transaction fee revenue model, a company receives a fee for enabling 
or executing a transaction. For example, eBay provides an online auction 
 marketplace and receives a small transaction fee from a seller if the seller is 
 successful in selling an item. E*Trade, an online stockbroker, receives transac-
tion fees each time it executes a stock transaction on behalf of a  customer. The 
transaction revenue model enjoys wide acceptance in part because the true 
cost of using the platform is not immediately apparent to the user.
Affiliate Revenue Model
In the affiliate revenue model, Web sites (called “affiliate Web sites”) send 
 visitors to other Web sites in return for a referral fee or percentage of the  revenue 
from any resulting sales. Referral fees are also referred to as “lead  generation 
fees.” For example, MyPoints makes money by  connecting  companies to poten-
tial customers by offering special deals to its members. When members take 
advantage of an offer and make a purchase, they earn “points” they can redeem 
for free products and services, and MyPoints receives a referral fee. Community 
feedback sites such as Epinions and Yelp receive much of their revenue from 
steering potential customers to Web sites where they make a  purchase. Amazon 
uses affiliates who steer business to the Amazon Web site by placing the Amazon 
logo on their blogs. Personal blogs often  contain display ads as a part of affiliate 
programs. Some  bloggers are paid directly by manufacturers, or receive free 
products, for speaking highly of  products and providing links to sales channels. 
Commercial bloggers are in essence affiliates paid to send customers to retail 
sites. 
10.3 HOW HAS E-COMMERCE TRANSFORMED 
MARKETING?
While e-commerce and the Internet have changed entire industries and enabled 
new  business models, no industry has been more affected than marketing and 
marketing  communications. 
 
Chapter 10 E-commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods

ers have opted to pay for music subscriptions, with 
the vast majority opting for the free service with 
ads. In fiscal 2013 Pandora’s total revenue was $427.1 
 million, of which $375.2 million (88 percent) came 
from advertising.
Pandora has been touted as a leading example 
of the “freemium” revenue business model, in 
which a business gives away some services for 
free and relies on a small percentage of customers 
to pay for premium versions of the same service. 
If a market is very large, getting just 1 percent 
of that  market to pay could be very lucrative—
under certain  circumstances. Although freemium 
is an efficient way of amassing a large group of 
 potential  customers, companies, including Pandora, 
have found that it challenging to convert people 
 enjoying the free service into customers willing 
to pay. A freemium model works best when a 
 business incurs very low marginal cost, approach-
ing zero, for each free user of its services, when 
a business can be supported by the percentage of 
customers willing to pay, and when there are other 
revenues like advertising fees that can make up for 
shortfalls in subscriber  revenues. 
In Pandora’s case, it appears that revenues 
will continue to come overwhelmingly from 
 advertising, and management is not worried. For 
the past few years, management has considered 
ads as  having much more revenue-generating 
potential than paid subscriptions and is not 
 pushing the  ad-free service. By continually  refining 
its  algorithms, Pandora is able to increase user 
 listening hours substantially. The more time  people 
spend with Pandora, the more opportunities there 
are for Pandora to deliver ads and generate ad 
 revenue. The average Pandora user listens to 19 
hours of music per month.
Pandora is now intensively mining the data 
 collected about its users for clues about the kinds 
of ads most likely to engage them. Pandora collects 
data about listener preferences from direct feedback 
such as likes and dislikes (indicated by thumbs up 
or down on the Pandora site) and “skip this song” 
requests, as well as data about which device people 
are using to listen to Pandora music, such as mobile 
phones or desktop computers. Pandora uses these 
inputs to select songs people will want to stick 
around for, and listen to. Pandora has honed its 
 algorithms so they can analyze billions more sig-
I NTER A C T IV E  S E S S IO N : O R G A N IZ AT IO N S
CAN PANDORA SUCCEED WITH FREEMIUM?
Pandora is the Internet’s most successful 
 subscription radio service. In May 2014, Pandora had 
77  million registered users. Pandora accounts for 
over 9 percent of total U.S. radio listening hours. The 
music is delivered to users from a cloud server, and 
is not stored on user devices.
It’s easy to see why Pandora is so popular. Users 
are able to hear only the music they like. Each user 
selects a genre of music based on a favorite musician 
or vocalist, and a computer algorithm puts together 
a “personal radio station” that plays the music of the 
selected artist plus closely related music by  different 
artists. The algorithm uses more than 450 factors 
to classify songs, such as the tempo and number of 
vocalists. These classifications, in conjunction with 
other signals from users, help Pandora’s algorithms 
select the next song to play. Users do not control 
what they hear. 
People love Pandora, but the question is whether 
this popularity can be translated into profits. How 
can Pandora compete with other online music 
 subscription services and online stations that have 
been making music available for free, sometimes 
without advertising? “Free” illegally downloaded 
music has also been a significant factor, as has 
been iTunes, charging 99 cents per song with no ad 
 support. At the time of Pandora’s founding (2005), 
iTunes was already a roaring success. 
Pandora’s first business model was to give away 
10 hours of free music and then ask subscribers to 
pay $36 per month for a year once they used up 
their 10 free hours. Result: 100,000 people listened 
to their 10 hours for free and then refused to pay 
for the annual service. Facing financial collapse, 
in November 2005 Pandora introduced an ad-
supported option. In 2006, Pandora added a “Buy” 
button to each song being played and struck deals 
with Amazon, iTunes, and other online retail sites. 
Pandora now gets an affiliate fee for directing listen-
ers to sites where users can buy the music. In 2008, 
Pandora added an iPhone app to allow users to sign 
up from their smartphones and listen all day if they 
wanted. Today, 70 percent of Pandora’s advertising 
revenue comes from mobile.
In late 2009 the company launched Pandora 
One, a premium service that offered no advertis-
ing, higher quality streaming music, a desktop app, 
and fewer usage limits. The service costs $4.99 per 
month. A very small percentage of Pandora listen-

3. Can Pandora succeed with its “freemium” model? 
Why or why not? What people, organization, and 
technology factors affect its success with this 
 business model?
CA S E  STUDY  Q UE STIONS
1. Analyze Pandora using the value chain and 
 competitive forces models. What competitive forces 
does the company have to deal with? What is its 
customer value proposition?
2. Explain how Pandora’s “freemium” business model 
works. How does the company generate revenue? 
nals from users generated over billions of  listening 
 minutes per month. Pandora is also trying to figure 
out when people are listening in groups such as 
car pools and dinner parties, which might justify 
Pandora charging higher prices for songs heard by 
groups rather than single individuals. 
The company is looking for correlations between 
users’ listening habits and the kinds of ads that 
would appeal to these users. People’s music, movie, 
or book choices may provide insight into their politi-
cal belief, religious faith, or other personal issues. 
Pandora has developed a political ad-targeting system 
that has been used in presidential, congressional, 
and gubernatorial campaigns that can use users’ song 
preferences to predict their political party of choice.
As impressive as these numbers are, Pandora 
(along with other streaming subscription services) 
is still struggling to show a profit. There are infra-
structure costs and royalties to pay for content 
from the music labels. Pandora’s royalty rates are 
less flexible than those of its competitor Spotify, 
which signed individual song royalty agreements 
with each record label. Pandora could be paying 
even higher rates when its current royalty  contracts 
expire in 2015. About 61 percent of Pandora’s 
 revenue is currently allocated to paying royalties. 
Advertising can only be leveraged so far, because 
users who opt for free ad-supported services gener-
ally do not tolerate heavy ad loads. Apple launched 
its iTunes radio service for the Fall of 2013 that will 
compete directly with Pandora. ITunes radio has 
both free ad- supported options, and a subscription 
service for $25 per year, undercutting Pandora’s 
annual subscription fee of $60. Can Pandora’s 
 business model succeed?

The Internet provides marketers with new ways of identifying and 
 communicating with millions of potential customers at costs far lower 
than  traditional media,  including search engine marketing, data mining, 
 recommender systems, and targeted e-mail. The Internet enables long tail 
marketing. Before the Internet, reaching a large audience was very  expensive, 
and marketers had to focus on attracting the largest number of  consumers 
with popular hit products, whether music, Hollywood movies, books, or cars. 
In  contrast, the Internet allows marketers to inexpensively find potential 
 customers for products where demand is very low. For instance, the Internet 
makes it possible to sell independent music profitably to very small audiences. 
There’s always some demand for almost any product. Put a string of such long 
tail sales together and you have a  profitable business.
The Internet also provides new ways—often instantaneous and spontane-
ous—to gather information from customers, adjust product offerings, and 
increase customer value. Table 10.6 describes the leading marketing and 
 advertising formats used in e-commerce.

BEHAVIORAL TARGETING
Many e-commerce marketing firms use behavioral targeting techniques to 
increase the effectiveness of banners, rich media, and video ads. Behavioral 
 targeting refers to  tracking the clickstreams (history of clicking behavior) of 
individuals on thousands of Web sites for the purpose of understanding their 
interests and intentions, and exposing them to  advertisements that are uniquely 
suited to their behavior. Proponents believe this more  precise understanding 
of the customer leads to more efficient marketing (the firm pays for ads only 
to those shoppers who are most interested in their products) and larger sales 
and revenues. Unfortunately, behavioral targeting of millions of Web users also 
leads to the invasion of personal privacy without user consent. When consum-
ers lose trust in their Web experience, they tend not to purchase anything. 
There is a growing backlash against the aggressive uses of personal information 
as consumers seek out safer havens for purchasing and messaging. SnapChat 
offers disappearing messages, and even Facebook has retreated by making its 
default for new posts to be “for friends only.” (Wood, 2014).
Popular Web sites have hundreds of beacon programs on their home pages 
which collect data on visitors behavior, and report that behavior to their 
 databases. There the information is often sold to data brokers, firms who  collect 
billions of data elements on every U.S. consumer and household, frequently 
combining online with off-line purchase information. The data brokers in turn

sell this information to advertisers who want to place ads on Web pages. A 
recent Federal Trade Commission report on nine data brokers found that one 
data  broker’s database had information on 1.4 billion consumer transactions 
and over 700 billion aggregated data elements. Another data broker had 3,000 
data measures for nearly every consumer in the U.S. (FTC, 2014). 
Behavioral targeting takes place at two levels: at individual Web sites or 
from within apps, and on various advertising networks that track users across 
 thousands of Web sites. All Web sites collect data on visitor browser activity 
and store it in a database. They have tools to record the site that users  visited 
prior to coming to the Web site, where these users go when they leave that 
site, the type of operating system they use, browser information, and even 
some location data. They also record the  specific pages visited on the particu-
lar site, the time spent on each page of the site, the types of pages visited, and 
what the  visitors purchased (see Figure 10.3). Firms analyze this information 
about  customer interests and behavior to develop precise profiles of existing 
and potential  customers. In addition, most major Web sites have hundreds of 
tracking  programs on their home pages, which track your clickstream  behavior 
across the Web by  following you from site to site and re-target ads to you by 
 showing you the same ads on different sites. The leading online advertising 
networks are Google’s DoubleClick, Yahoo’s RightMedia, and AOL’s Ad Network. 
Ad  networks represent publishers who have space to sell, and advertisers who 
want to market online. The lubricant of this trade is information on millions of 
Web shoppers, which helps advertisers target their ads to precisely the groups 
and individuals they desire.
This information enables firms to understand how well their Web site is 
working, create unique personalized Web pages that display content or ads for 
products or services of special interest to each user, improve the  customer’s 
 FIGURE 10.3 WEB SITE VISITOR TRACKING
E-commerce Web sites and advertising platforms like Google’s DoubleClick have tools to track a 
 shopper’s every step through an online store and then across the Web as shoppers move from site to 
site. Close  examination of customer behavior at a Web site selling women’s clothing shows what the 
store might learn at each step and what actions it could take to increase sales.
 
Chapter 10 E-commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods

experience, and create additional value through a better understanding of the 
shopper (see Figure 10.4). By using personalization technology to modify the 
Web pages presented to each customer, marketers achieve some of the benefits 
of using individual salespeople at dramatically lower costs. For instance, General 
Motors will show a Chevrolet banner ad to women emphasizing safety and util-
ity, while men will receive different ads emphasizing power and ruggedness.
What if you are a large national advertising company with many different 
 clients trying to reach millions of consumers? What if you were a large global 
manufacturer trying to reach potential consumers for your products? With 
 millions of Web sites, working with each one would be impractical. Advertising 
networks solve this problem by creating a network of several thousand of the 
most popular Web sites visited by millions of people, tracking the behavior 
of these users across the entire network, building profiles of each user, and 
then selling these profiles to advertisers. Popular Web sites download dozens 
of Web tracking cookies, bugs, and beacons, which report user online  behavior 
to remote servers without the users’ knowledge. Looking for young, single 
 consumers, with college degrees, living in the Northeast, in the 18–34 age range 
who are interested in purchasing a European car? Not a problem. Advertising 
 networks can identify and deliver hundreds of thousands of people who fit this 
profile and expose them to ads for European cars as they move from one Web 
site to another. Estimates vary, but behaviorally targeted ads are  generally 10 
times more likely to produce a consumer response than a randomly chosen 
banner or video ad (see Figure 10.5). So-called advertising exchanges use this 
same  technology to auction access to people with very specific profiles to 
 FIGURE 10.4 WEB SITE PERSONALIZATION
Firms can create unique personalized Web pages that display content or ads for products or services of 
special interest to individual users, improving the customer experience and creating additional value.

WORKS
Advertising networks and their use of tracking programs have become controversial among privacy 
advocates because of their ability to track individual consumers across the Internet.
 advertisers in a few milliseconds. In 2014, about 25 percent of online display ads 
are targeted, and the rest depend on the context of the pages shoppers visit, the 
estimated demographics of visitors, or so-called “blast and scatter”  advertising, 
which is placed randomly on any available page with minimal targeting, such 
as time of day or season. Several surveys have reported that over 75  percent of 
American consumers do not approve of behaviorally targeted ads. 
Two-thirds (68 percent) of Internet users disapprove of search engines and 
Web sites tracking their online behavior in order to aim targeted ads at them. 
Twenty-eight percent of those surveyed approve of behavioral targeting because 
they believe it produces more relevant ads and information (Pew Internet, 2012). 
A majority of Americans want a “Do Not Track” option in browsers that will stop 
Web sites from collecting information about their online behavior (Hoofnagle, 
et. al., 2012). According to a recent survey, Americans’ privacy  concerns about 
online invasions of privacy are growing stronger, leading to people taking  concrete 
actions to protect themselves (Pew Research Center, 2013). Over 50  percent are 
very concerned about the wealth of personal data online; 86 percent have taken 
steps to mask their online behavior; 25 percent of Web users use  ad-blocking 
 software. Next to hackers, Americans try to avoid advertisers pursuing them 
while online, and 64 percent block cookies to make tracking more difficult.
SOCIAL E-COMMERCE AND SOCIAL NETWORK 
MARKETING 
Social e-commerce is commerce based on the idea of the digital social graph. 
The digital social graph is a mapping of all significant online social relation-
ships. The social graph is synonymous with the idea of a “social network” used 
to describe offline relationships. You can map your own social graph  (network) 
by drawing lines from yourself to the 10 closest people you know. If they know 
 
Chapter 10 E-commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods 
437

one another, draw lines between these people. If you are ambitious, ask these 
10 friends to list and draw in the names of the 10 people closest to them. What 
emerges from this exercise is a preliminary map of your social network. Now 
imagine if everyone on the Internet did the same, and posted the results to 
a very large database with a Web site. Ultimately, you would end up with 
Facebook or a site like it. The collection of all these personal social networks is 
called “the social graph.” 
According to small world theory, you are only six links away from any other 
person on earth. If you entered your personal address book, which has, say, 100 
names in it, on to a list and sent it to your friends, and they in turn entered 50 
new names of their friends, and so on, five times, the social network created 
would encompass 31 billion people! The social graph is therefore a collection of 
millions of personal social graphs (and all the people in them). So, it’s a small 
world indeed, and we are all more closely linked than we ever thought. 
Ultimately, you will find that you are directly connected to many friends 
and relatives, and indirectly connected to an even larger universe of indirect 
friends and relatives (your distant second and third cousins, and their friends). 
Theoretically, it takes six links for any one person to find another person 
 anywhere on earth. 
If you understand the inter-connectedness of people, you will see just how 
important this concept is to e-commerce: The products and services you buy 
will influence the  decisions of your friends, and their decisions will in turn 
influence you. If you are a marketer  trying to build and strengthen a brand, 
the implication is clear: Take advantage of the fact that people are enmeshed 
in social networks, share interests and values, and communicate and influ-
ence one another. As a marketer, your target audience is not a million isolated 
people watching a TV show, but the social network of people who watch the 
show, and the viewers’ personal networks. Table 10.7 describes the features of 
social  commerce that are driving its growth.
In 2014, one of the fastest growing media for branding and marketing is 
social media. In 2014, companies will spend $6.7 billion using social networks 
like Facebook to reach millions of consumers who spend hours a day on the 
Facebook site. Facebook accounts for 90 percent of all social marketing in the 
Untied States. Expenditures for social media marketing are much smaller than 
television,  magazines, and even newspapers, but this will change in the future. 
Social networks in the offline world are collections of people who voluntarily 
communicate with one another over an extended period of time. Online social 
networks, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Tumblr, and Google+, along 
with other sites with social  components, are Web sites that enable users to 
 communicate with one another, form group and individual relationships, and 
share interests, values, and ideas. Individuals establish online profiles with text 
and photos, creating an online profile of how they want others to see them, and 
then invite their friends to link to their profile. The network grows by word of 
mouth and through e-mail links. One of the most ubiquitous graphical elements 
on Web sites is Facebook’s Like button, which allows users to tell their friends 
they like a product, service, or content. Facebook processes around 50 million 
Likes a day, or 1.5  billion a year.
While Facebook, with 137 million U.S. monthly visitors, receives most of the 
public attention given to social networking, the other top four social sites are also 
growing, but at slower rates than in the past. Facebook user growth has slowed 
in the United States. LinkedIn growth slowed in 2013 to 40 percent, and it has 48 
million visitors a month in 2014. Twitter grew only 11 percent in 2013 to reach 37 
million; the social blogging site Tumblr reached 23  million people a month; and 
438 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

Pinterest hit the top 50 Web sites with 26 million. MySpace, in contrast, has been 
 shrinking for years, and attracted only 5.4 million visitors monthly. According to 
ComScore, about 30 percent of the total time spent online in the United States 
was spent on social network sites, and it is the most common online activ-
ity. (ComScore, 2014). The fastest growing smartphone applications are social 
 network apps: nearly half of smartphone users visit social sites daily. More than 
58 percent of all visits to Facebook in 2014 come from smartphones.
At social shopping sites like Pinterest, Kaboodle, ThisNext, and Stylehive, 
you can swap shopping ideas with friends. Facebook offers the Like button and 
Google the +1 button to let your friends know you admire something, and in 
some cases, purchased something online. Online communities are also ideal 
venues to employ viral marketing techniques. Online viral marketing is like 
traditional word-of-mouth marketing except that the word can spread across an 
online community at the speed of light, and go much further geographically 
than a small network of friends.
The Wisdom of Crowds
Creating sites where thousands, even millions, of people can interact offers 
business firms new ways to market and advertise, and to discover who likes (or 
hates) their products. In a phenomenon called “the wisdom of crowds,” some 
argue that large numbers of people can make better decisions about a wide 
range of topics or products than a single person or even a small committee of 
experts.
TABLE 10.7 FEATURES OF SOCIAL COMMERCE
SOCIAL COMMERCE FEATURE
DESCRIPTION
Newsfeed
A stream of notifications from friends, and advertisers, that social 
users find on their home pages.
Timelines
A stream of photos and events in the past that create a personal 
history for users, one that can be shared with friends. 
Social sign-on
Web sites allow users to sign into their sites through their social 
network pages on Facebook or another social site. This allows Web 
sites to receive valuable social profile information from Facebook 
and use it in their own marketing efforts. 
Collaborative shopping
Creating an environment where consumers can share their 
shopping experiences with one another by viewing products, 
chatting, or texting. Friends can chat online about brands, products, 
and services. 
Network notification
Creating an environment where consumers can share their 
approval (or disapproval) of products, services, or content, or share 
their geo-location, perhaps a restaurant or club, with friends. 
Facebook’s ubiquitous Like button is an example. Twitter’s tweets 
and followers are another example. 
Social search 
(recommendations) 
Enabling an environment where consumers can ask their friends 
for advice on purchases of products, services, and content. While 
Google can help you find things, social search can help you 
evaluate the quality of things by listening to the evaluations of 
your friends, or their friends. For instance, Amazon’s social 
recommender system can use your Facebook social profile to 
recommend products.
 
Chapter 10 E-commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods 
439

Obviously this is not always the case, but it can happen in interesting ways. 
In marketing, the wisdom of crowds concept suggests that firms should consult 
with thousands of their customers first as a way of establishing a relationship 
with them, and second, to better understand how their products and services 
are used and appreciated (or rejected). Actively soliciting the comments of your 
customers builds trust and sends the message to your customers that you care 
what they are thinking, and that you need their advice.
Beyond merely soliciting advice, firms can be actively helped in solving 
some business problems using what is called crowdsourcing. For instance, 
in 2006, Netflix announced a contest in which it offered to pay $1 million to 
the person or team who comes up with a method for improving by 10 percent 
Netflix’s  prediction of what movies customers would like as measured against 
their actual choices. By 2009, Netflix received 44,014 entries from 5,169 teams 
in 186 countries. The winning team improved a key part of Netflix’s business: 
a recommender system that recommends to its customers what new movies to 
order based on their personal past movie choices and the choices of millions of 
other customers who are like them. In 2012, BMW launched a crowdsourcing 
project to enlist the aid of customers in designing an urban vehicle for 2025. 
Kickstarter.com is arguably one of the most famous e-commerce crowdfund-
ing sites where visitors invest in start-up companies. Other examples include 
Caterpillar  working with customers to design better machinery, and Pepsico 
using Super Bowl 2013 viewers to build an online video (Boulton, 2013).
Firms can also use the wisdom of crowds in the form of prediction  markets. 
Prediction Markets are established as peer-to-peer betting markets where 
participants make bets on specific outcomes of, say, quarterly sales of a new 
product, designs for new products, or political elections. The world’s largest 
commercial prediction market is Betfair, where you bet for or against specific 
outcomes on football games, horse races, and whether or not the Dow Jones will 
go up or down in a single day. Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) is an  academic 
market focused on elections. You can place bets on the outcome of local and 
national elections. In the United States, the largest prediction market is Intrade.
com, where users can buy or sell shares in predictions.
Marketing via social media is still in its early stages, and  companies are 
 experimenting in hopes of finding a winning formula. Social interactions and 
customer  sentiment are not always easy to manage, presenting new  challenges 
for companies eager to protect their brands. The chapter-ending case study 
 provides specific examples of  companies’ social marketing efforts using 
Facebook and Twitter.
10.4 HOW HAS E-COMMERCE AFFECTED 
BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS?
The trade between business firms (business-to-business commerce or B2B) 
 represents a huge marketplace. The total amount of B2B trade in the United 
States in 2014 is  estimated to be about $13.8 trillion, with B2B e-commerce 
(online B2B)  contributing about $5.7  trillion of that amount (U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2013; authors’ estimates). By 2017, B2B e-commerce is expected 
to grow to about $7.8 trillion in the United States. The process of conduct-
ing trade among  business firms is complex and requires  significant human 
intervention, and  therefore, it  consumes  significant resources. Some firms 
 estimate that each corporate purchase order for support products costs them, 
440 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

on average, at least $100 in administrative  overhead. Administrative  overhead 
includes processing paper, approving  purchase  decisions,  spending time 
using the telephone and fax machines to search for products and arrange 
for  purchases,  arranging for  shipping, and receiving the goods. Across the 
economy, this adds up to  trillions of  dollars annually being spent for procure-
ment processes that could  potentially be automated. If even just a portion of 
inter-firm trade were automated, and parts of the entire  procurement  process 
assisted by the Internet, literally trillions of  dollars might be released for more 
productive uses, consumer prices potentially would fall,  productivity would 
increase, and the economic wealth of the nation would expand. This is the 
promise of B2B e-commerce. The challenge of B2B e-commerce is changing 
existing patterns and  systems of procurement, and designing and implement-
ing new Internet-based B2B solutions.
ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI)
Business-to-business e-commerce refers to the commercial transactions that 
occur among business firms. Increasingly, these transactions are flowing 
through a variety of different Internet-enabled mechanisms. About 80 percent 
of online B2B e-commerce is still based on proprietary systems for electronic 
data interchange (EDI). Electronic data  interchange enables the computer-to-
computer exchange between two organizations of  standard transactions such as 
invoices, bills of lading, shipment schedules, or purchase orders. Transactions 
are automatically transmitted from one information system to another through 
a network, eliminating the printing and handling of paper at one end and the 
 inputting of data at the other. Each major industry in the United States and 
much of the rest of the world has EDI standards that define the structure and 
information fields of electronic documents for that industry.
EDI originally automated the exchange of documents such as purchase 
orders, invoices, and shipping notices. Although many companies still use EDI 
for document automation, firms engaged in just-in-time inventory replenish-
ment and continuous production use EDI as a system for continuous replenish-
ment. Suppliers have online access to selected parts of the purchasing firm’s 
production and delivery schedules and automatically ship  materials and goods 
to meet  prespecified  targets without intervention by firm purchasing agents 
(see Figure 10.6). 
Although many organizations still use private networks for EDI, they are 
increasingly Web-enabled because Internet technology provides a much more 
 FIGURE 10.6 ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI)
Companies use EDI to automate transactions for B2B e-commerce and continuous inventory replenish-
ment. Suppliers can automatically send data about shipments to purchasing firms. The purchasing 
firms can use EDI to provide production and inventory requirements and payment data to suppliers.
 
Chapter 10 E-commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods

flexible and low-cost  platform for linking to other firms. Businesses are able to 
extend digital technology to a wider range of activities and broaden their circle 
of trading partners.
Take procurement, for example. Procurement involves not only purchas-
ing goods and materials but also sourcing, negotiating with suppliers, paying 
for goods, and  making  delivery arrangements. Businesses can now use the 
Internet to locate the lowest-cost  supplier, search online catalogs of supplier 
products, negotiate with suppliers, place orders, make payments, and arrange 
transportation. They are not limited to partners linked by  traditional EDI 
networks. 
NEW WAYS OF B2B BUYING AND SELLING
The Internet and Web technology enable businesses to create new electronic 
storefronts for selling to other businesses with multimedia graphic displays and 
interactive features similar to those for B2C commerce. Alternatively,  businesses 
can use Internet technology to create extranets or electronic  marketplaces for 
linking to other businesses for purchase and sale transactions. 
Private industrial networks typically consist of a large firm using a secure 
Web site to link to its suppliers and other key business partners (see Figure 10.7). 
The network is owned by the buyer, and it permits the firm and designated 
 suppliers, distributors, and other  business partners to share product design and 
development, marketing, production  scheduling, inventory management, and 
unstructured communication, including graphics and e-mail. Another term for 
a private industrial network is a private exchange.
An example is VW Group Supply, which links the Volkswagen Group and 
its suppliers. VW Group Supply handles 90 percent of all global purchasing for 
Volkswagen, including all automotive and parts components.
 FIGURE 10.7 A PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL NETWORK

442 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

 FIGURE 10.8 A NET MARKETPLACE
Net marketplaces are online marketplaces where multiple buyers can purchase from multiple sellers.
Net marketplaces, which are sometimes called e-hubs, provide a single, 
 digital  marketplace based on Internet technology for many different buyers and 
sellers (see Figure 10.8). They are industry-owned or operate as  independent 
intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Net  marketplaces generate  revenue 
from  purchase and sale transactions and other  services  provided to clients. 
Participants in Net marketplaces can establish prices through online negotia-
tions, auctions, or requests for quotations, or they can use fixed prices. 
There are many different types of Net marketplaces and ways of classifying 
them. Some Net marketplaces sell direct goods and some sell indirect goods. 
Direct goods are goods used in a production process, such as sheet steel for 
auto body production. Indirect goods are all other goods not directly involved 
in the production process, such as office supplies or products for maintenance 
and repair. Some Net marketplaces support contractual  purchasing based 
on long-term relationships with designated suppliers, and others support 
 short-term spot purchasing, where goods are purchased based on immediate 
needs, often from many different suppliers. 
Some Net marketplaces serve vertical markets for specific industries, such 
as  automobiles, telecommunications, or machine tools, whereas others serve 
 horizontal  markets for goods and services that can be found in many different 
industries, such as office equipment or transportation. 
Exostar is an example of an industry-owned Net marketplace, focusing 
on  long-term  contract purchasing relationships and on providing common 
 networks and computing p latforms for reducing supply chain inefficiencies. 
This aerospace and defense  industry-sponsored Net marketplace was founded 
jointly by BAE Systems, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Rolls-Royce 
PLC to connect these companies to their  suppliers and facilitate collaboration. 
More than 70,000 trading partners in the commercial, military, and govern-
ment sectors use Exostar’s sourcing, e-procurement, and collaboration tools for 
both direct and indirect goods.
Exchanges are independently owned third-party Net marketplaces that 
 connect  thousands of suppliers and buyers for spot purchasing. Many exchanges 
 
Chapter 10 E-commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods 
443

provide vertical markets for a single industry, such as food, electronics, or 
industrial equipment, and they primarily deal with direct inputs. For example, 
Go2Paper enables a spot market for paper, board, and craft among buyers and 
sellers in the paper industries from over 75 countries. 
Exchanges proliferated during the early years of e-commerce but many have 
failed. Suppliers were reluctant to participate because the exchanges encour-
aged competitive  bidding that drove prices down and did not offer any  long-term 
relationships with buyers or services to make lowering prices worthwhile. 
Many essential direct purchases are not conducted on a spot basis because they 
require contracts and consideration of issues such as delivery  timing, custom-
ization, and quality of products.
10.5 WHAT IS THE ROLE OF M-COMMERCE IN 
BUSINESS AND WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT 
M-COMMERCE APPLICATIONS?
Walk down the street in any major metropolitan area and count how many 
 people are  pecking away at their iPhones, Samsungs or BlackBerrys. Ride the 
trains, fly the planes, and you’ll see your  fellow travelers reading an online 
newspaper, watching a video on their phone, or  reading a novel on their Kindle. 
In five years, the majority of Internet users in the United States will rely on 
mobile devices as their primary device for accessing the Internet. As the mobile 
 audience expands in leaps and bounds, mobile advertising and m-commerce 
have taken off. 
In 2014, m-commerce constitute about 19 percent of all e-commerce, with 
about $57 billion in annual revenues generated by retail goods and services, 
apps, advertising, music, videos, ring tones, applications,  movies, television, 
and location-based services like local restaurant locators and traffic updates. 
However, m-commerce is the fastest growing form of e-commerce, with some 
areas expanding at a rate of 50 percent or more per year, and is estimated to 
grow to $132 billion in 2018 (see Figure 10.9) (eMarketer, 2014d). It is becoming 
especially popular in the online travel industry, as discussed in the Interactive 
Session on Technology.
The main areas of growth in mobile e-commerce are retail sales at the top 
Mobile 400 companies, including Amazon ($4 billion) and Apple (about $1.1 
billion); and sales of  digital content music, TV shows and movies (about $4 bil-
lion) (Internet Retailer, 2013). These  estimates do not include mobile advertis-
ing or location-based services. 
M-commerce applications have taken off for services that are time-critical, 
that appeal to people on the move, or that accomplish a task more efficiently 
than other methods. The Interactive Session on Technology describes how 
m-commerce is benefiting the online travel industry and the following sections 
provide other examples.
LOCATION-BASED SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS 
Location-based services include geosocial services, geoadvertising, and geo-
information services. Seventy-four percent of smartphone owners use loca-
tion-based services. What ties these activities together and is the foundation 
for mobile commerce is the global positioning system (GPS) enabled map 
services available on smartphones. A geosocial service can tell you where

your friends are meeting. Geoadvertising services can tell you where to find 
the nearest Italian restaurant, and geoinformation services can tell you the 
price of a house you are looking at, or about special exhibits at a museum you 
are passing. 
Wikitude.me is an example of a geoinformation service. Wikitude.me 
 provides a  special kind of browser for smartphones equipped with a built-in 
GPS and compass that can  identify your precise location and where the phone 
is pointed. Using information from over 800,000 points of interest available on 
Wikipedia, plus thousands of other local sites, the browser overlays informa-
tion about points of interest you are viewing, and displays that information 
on your smartphone screen, superimposed on a map or  photograph that you 
just snapped. For example, users can point their smartphone  cameras towards 
mountains from a tour bus and see the names and heights of the mountains 
displayed on the screen. Wikitude.me also allows users to geo-tag the world 
around them, and then submit the tags to Wikitude in order to share content 
with other users.
Foursquare, Loopt, and new offerings by Facebook and Google are examples 
of geosocial services. Geosocial  services help you find friends, or be found by 
your friends, by “checking in” to the  service, announcing your presence in a 
 restaurant or other place. Your friends are instantly notified. About 20 percent 
of smartphone owners use geosocial services. The popularity of specialized sites 
like Foursquare has waned as Facebook and Google+ have moved into geoso-
cial services and turned them into extensions of their larger social networks.
Loopt claimed more than 5 million users in 2014. The service doesn’t sell 
information to advertisers, but does post ads based on user location. Loopt’s 
target is to deal with advertisers at the walking level (within 200 to 250 meters). 
Foursquare provides a similar location-based social networking service to 22 
million registered users, who may connect with friends and update their loca-
tion. Points are awarded for checking in at designated venues. Users choose to 
have their check-ins posted on their accounts on Twitter, Facebook, or both. 
Users also earn badges by checking in at locations with certain tags, for check-
in frequency, or for the time of check-in. More than 500,000 local merchants 
worldwide use the merchant platform for marketing.

When it comes to mobile apps and gauging their 
impact on consumers and business, the online travel 
industry and its airline and hotel reservation  systems 
are probably the best place to look. And there’s no 
better company in this industry in developing mobile 
apps than Orbitz Worldwide Inc. Orbitz  connects 
consumers to plane tickets from 400 airlines, hotel 
rooms from 80,000 hotels worldwide, as well as 
rental cars, cruises, and vacation packages. 
Orbitz was launched in 2001 by five major 
 airlines—Delta, United, Continental, Northwest, and 
American, to compete with Internet travel compa-
nies such as Priceline, Travelocity, and Expedia, 
which were upending the travel industry. These 
companies have remained formidable competitors.
From its very beginning, Orbitz distinguished 
itself as a leader in mobile technology. In 2006, it 
became the first Internet travel company to offer a 
mobile Web site where users could check flight  status 
for 27 airlines, search for hotels in the United States 
and Cancun, Mexico, and access a personal page 
with itineraries for Orbitz-booked trips. 
During the years that followed, Orbiz made many 
enhancements to its mobile services. It enabled 
mobile users to view average wait times for airport 
security lines, locate available Wi-Fi services at air-
ports, compute check-in delays and taxi line wait 
times, and view weather and traffic conditions. In 
2010, Orbitz redesigned its mobile Web site so that 
users of any Web-enabled device could access capabili-
ties similar to any full-screen e-commerce site, includ-
ing the ability to purchase flight tickets, book car 
 rentals, and obtain hotel reservations. Like the stan-
dard Orbitz Web site, the redesigned mobile site offers 
a Price Assurance service, which guarantees custom-
ers an automatic refund if another Orbitz customer 
books the same service for less. Orbitz also developed 
apps that ran on iPhones, iPads and later Android 
devices that could perform the same functions. 
Orbitz was first-to-market with an m-commerce 
site designed specifically for business users. The 
opportunity was huge, since most business travelers 
carry smartphones or tablets. Corporate travelers 
typically must adhere to company rules specifying 
preferred vendors, cost limits, mandatory services, 
and expense documentation. Since each company 
has its own business “rules” for travel, the Orbitz 
m-commerce platform needed to be customized for 
each firm. Orbitz constructed a mobile Web site that 
could be accessed from any Web-enabled device. 
The Orbitz for Business mobile Web site delivers the 
same set of tools enjoyed by the consumer market 
while incorporating features that enable business 
travelers to adhere to company guidelines—the 
ability to enter and modify the purpose of the trip, 
search results that give precedence to preferred ven-
dors, and access to company-specific reference data. 
In 2011, the m-commerce site was again upgraded 
to respond to swiping gestures, expedite touch screen 
transactions, and accommodate the small screen 
size of any Web-enabled mobile device. Orbitz’s 
new  proprietary global online travel agency plat-
form creates mobile HTML5 Web pages on the fly 
from  standard e-commerce Web pages. Mobile users 
can book vacation packages, view the savings from 
simultaneously booking a flight and hotel room, 
and create an online profile linked to their credit 
card to expedite the checkout process. GPS and 
improved search capabilities enable consumers to 
locate nearby hotels and conduct price, distance, 
and rating comparisons; to compare flights and car 
rentals based on various  criteria, including traveler 
type; and to access  customer reviews. Orbitz also 
instituted mobile exclusive same-day deals, called 
Mobile Steals, available both on the m-commerce site 
and through the Hotels by Orbitz app available for 
iPhone and Android devices. Proprietors are able to 
fill rooms that might otherwise remain vacant, and 
consumers save up to 50 percent of the standard rate. 
While only 12–14 percent of traditional e-commerce 
Web site shoppers want to reserve a room for the day 
on which they are searching, smartphone and other 
mobile users book for the same night between 50 to 
60 percent of the time because they are more likely 
to be traveling and need a room at the last minute. 
Orbitz touts the ability to book a hotel room in just 
three taps. The new mobile Web site has produced a 
110 percent increase in visits, a 145 percent increase 
in the conversion rate, and four times the num-
ber of transactions compared to the original Orbitz 
m-commerce site. Orbitz has been focusing on lodging 
because hotel bookings are more profitable than air-
line reservations. Priceline.com, the largest and most 
profitable online travel agency, generates approxi-
mately 90 percent of its sales from hotels. Orbitz 
receives only 27 percent of revenue from hotels.

WILL MOBILE TECHNOLOGY PUT ORBITZ IN THE LEAD?
446 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

1. How important is mobile technology in Orbitz’s 
business strategy? Why?
2. What managment, organization, and technology 
issues did Orbitz need to address in its mobile 
strategy?
Orbitz further enhanced its iOS and Android apps 
to cut down the number of steps required to search 
for and make reservations so that the entire process 
can take place on the mobile device without redirect-
ing the user to hotel, airline, or car rental Web sites 
to complete the transaction. Orbitz now has apps 
for the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Kindle Fire, and 
Android devices.
Does all this investment in mobile technology 
make a difference? Chris Brown, Orbitz vice presi-
dent in charge of product strategy, believes that the 
ability to be a major player in the rapidly escalating 
 m-commerce market will pay off. Increased transac-
tion speed provided by Orbitz mobile apps will attract 
new customers, especially those trying to book same-
day reservations, which account for about 50 percent 
of Orbitz’s mobile car rental purchases. Consumers 
who book with mobile devices tend to book closer to 
when they travel and are more certain to buy than 
just shop. By the end of 2013, mobile apps accounted 
for about 30 percent of Orbitz hotel transactions.
But the other online travel players also believe 
consumers will increasingly move to mobile to 
make their travel plans, and they also have been 
making large investments in mobile Web sites, 
search tools, and apps. Priceline and TripAdvisor 
have rated highest in providing an engaging, enjoy-

able experience on their sites, and both continue 
to enjoy much stronger growth in unique visi-
tors and visits than Expedia and Orbitz. Travelers 
are increasingly planning trips on sites such as 
TripAdvisor, which aggregate offerings from a 
number of different online sources in one place. 
TripAdvisor offers more than 100 million traveler 
reviews and obtains most of its revenue from ads 
and referrals to other travel sites. TripAdvisor 
recently redesigned its Web site to show customers 
all the rates offered by online agents like Expedia, 
Priceline, and Travelocity in a single list on its site. 
By using this “metasearch” capability, customers 
are able to find the lowest prices on a single screen 
without having to click on several links.

Connecting people to local merchants in the form of geoadvertising is the 
 economic foundation for mobile commerce. Mobile advertising will reach $17.7 
billion in 2014, up 83 percent from 2013. Geoadvertising sends ads to users based 
on their GPS locations. Smartphones report their locations back to Google and 
Apple. Merchants buy access to these consumers when they come within range 
of a merchant. For instance, Kiehl Stores, a cosmetics retailer, sent  special offers 
and announcements to customers who came within 100 yards of their store.
OTHER MOBILE COMMERCE SERVICES
Banks and credit card companies are rolling out services that let customers 
manage their accounts from their mobile devices. JPMorgan Chase and Bank 
of America customers can use their cell phones to check account balances,

 transfer funds, and pay bills. Apple Pay for the iPhone 6 and Apple Watch, 
along with other Android and Windows smartphone models, allows users to 
charge items to their credit card accounts with a swipe of their phone. (See our 
Learning Track on mobile payment systems.)
Although the mobile advertising market is currently small, it is rapidly 
 growing (up 75 percent from last year and expected to grow to over $47 billion by 
2017), as more and more companies seek ways to exploit new  databases of loca-
tion-specific information. The  largest providers of mobile display  advertising 
are Apple’s iAd platform and Google’s AdMob platform (both with a 21  percent 
market share) followed by Millenial Media. Facebook is a distant fourth but 
moving rapidly to catch up. Alcatel-Lucent offers a new  service to be managed 
by Placecast that will identify cell phone users within a  specified distance of an 
advertiser’s nearest outlet and notify them about the outlet’s address and phone 
number, perhaps including a link to a coupon or other  promotion. Placecast’s 
clients include Hyatt, FedEx, and Avis Rent-A-Car. 
Yahoo displays ads on its mobile home page for companies such as Pepsi, 
Procter & Gamble, Hilton, Nissan, and Intel. Google is displaying ads linked to 
cell phone searches by users of the mobile version of its search engine, while 
Microsoft offers banner and text advertising on its MSN Mobile portal in the 
United States. Ads are embedded in games, videos, and other mobile applications.
Shopkick is a mobile application that enables retailers such as Best Buy, 
Sports Authority, and Macy’s to offer coupons to people when they walk into 
their stores. The Shopkick app automatically recognizes when the user has 
entered a partner retail store and offers a new virtual currency called “kick-
bucks,” which can be redeemed for Facebook credits, iTunes Gift Cards, travel 
vouchers, DVDs, or immediate cash-back rewards at any of the partner stores.
Fifty-five percent of online  retailers now have m-commerce Web sites—sim-
plified  versions of their Web sites that make it  possible for shoppers to use cell 
phones to place orders. Clothing retailers Lilly Pulitzer and Armani Exchange, 
Home Depot, Amazon, Walmart, and 1–800-Flowers are among those compa-
nies with apps for m-commerce sales.
10.6 WHAT ISSUES MUST BE ADDRESSED WHEN 
BUILDING AN E-COMMERCE PRESENCE?
Building a successful e-commerce presence requires a keen understanding of 
 business,  technology, and social issues, as well as a systematic approach. Today, 
an e-commerce presence is not just a corporate Web site, but may also include 
a social network site on Facebook, a Twitter feed, and smartphone apps where 
customers can access your services. Developing and coordinating all these dif-
ferent customer venues can be difficult. A complete treatment of the topic is 
beyond the scope of this text, and students should  consult books devoted to 
just this topic (Laudon and Traver, 2015). The two most  important management 
challenges in building a successful e-commerce presence are (1) developing a 
clear understanding of your business objectives and (2) knowing how to choose 
the right  technology to achieve those objectives.
DEVELOP AN E-COMMERCE PRESENCE MAP
E-commerce has moved from being a PC-centric activity on the Web to a mobile 
and  tablet-based activity. While 80 percent or more of e-commerce today is

conducted using PCs, increasingly smartphones and tablets will be used for pur-
chasing. Currently, smartphones and tablets are used by a majority of Internet 
users in the United States to shop for goods and  services, look up prices, enjoy 
entertainment, and access social sites, less so to make  purchases. Your poten-
tial  customers use these various devices at different times during the day, and 
involve themselves in  different conversations depending what they are doing— 
touching base with friends, tweeting, or  reading a blog. Each of these are “touch 
points” where you can meet the customer, and you have to think about how 
you develop a presence in these  different virtual places. Figure 10.10 provides 
a roadmap to the platforms and related  activities you will need to think about 
when developing your e-commerce presence.
Figure 10.10 illustrates four different kinds of e-commerce presence: Web 
sites, e-mail, social media, and offline media. For each of these types there are 
 different  platforms that you will need to address. For instance, in the case of Web 
site presence, there are three different platforms: traditional desktop, tablets, and 
smartphones, each with different capabilities. And for each type of e-commerce 
presence there are related activities you will need to consider. For instance, 
in the case of Web sites, you will want to engage in search engine marketing, 
 display ads, affiliate programs, and sponsorships. Offline media, the fourth type 
of e-commerce presence, is included here because many firms use multiplatform 
or integrated marketing where print ads refer customers to Web sites.

Review Summary
1. What are the unique features of e-commerce, digital markets, and digital goods?
E-commerce involves digitally enabled commercial transactions between and among organizations 
and individuals. Unique features of e-commerce technology include ubiquity, global reach, universal 
technology standards, richness, interactivity, information density, capabilities for personalization and 
customization, and social technology. E-commerce is becoming increasingly social, mobile, and local.
Digital markets are said to be more “transparent” than traditional markets, with reduced informa-
tion  asymmetry, search costs, transaction costs, and menu costs, along with the  ability to change 
prices dynamically based on market conditions. Digital goods, such as music, video, software, and 
books, can be delivered over a digital network. Once a digital product has been produced, the cost of 
delivering that product digitally is extremely low.
2. What are the principal e-commerce business and revenue models?
E-commerce business models are e-tailers, transaction brokers, market creators, content  providers, 
 community providers, service providers, and portals. The principal  e-commerce revenue models are 
 advertising, sales, subscription, free/freemium, transaction fee, and affiliate.
3. How has e-commerce transformed marketing?
The Internet provides marketers with new ways of identifying and communicating with millions of 
 potential customers at costs far lower than traditional media. Crowdsourcing utilizing the “wisdom of 
crowds” helps companies learn from customers in order to improve product offerings and increase 
 customer value. Behavioral targeting techniques increase the effectiveness of banner, rich media, and 
video ads. Social commerce uses social networks and social network sites to improve targeting of  products 
and services.

4. How has e-commerce affected business-to-business transactions?
B2B  e -commerce generates efficiencies by enabling companies to locate suppliers, solicit bids, place 
orders, and track shipments in transit electronically. Net marketplaces provide a single,  digital  marketplace 
for many buyers and sellers. Private industrial networks link a firm with its suppliers and other strategic 
 business partners to develop highly efficient and responsive supply chains.
5. What is the role of m-commerce in business, and what are the most important m-commerce  applications?
M-commerce is especially well suited for location-based applications, such as finding local hotels and 
restaurants, monitoring local traffic and weather, and providing personalized location-based  marketing. 
Mobile phones and  handhelds are being used for mobile bill payment, banking, securities trading, 
 transportation schedule updates, and downloads of digital content, such as music, games, and video clips. 
M-commerce requires wireless portals and special digital payment systems that can  handle micropay-
ments. The GPS capabilities of smartphones make possible geoadvertising,  geosocial, and geoinformation 
services.
6. What issues must be addressed when building an e-commerce presence? 
Building a successful e-commerce presence requires a clear understanding of the business objectives to 
be achieved and selection of the right platforms, activities, and timeline to achieve those objectives. An 
e-commerce presence includes not only a corporate Web site but also a presence on Facebook, Twitter, and 
other social networking sites and smartphone apps.

To Pay or Not to Pay: Zagat’s Dilemma
CASE STUDY
F
ounded by Tim and Nina Zagat, the Zagat 
Survey has collected and published ratings 
of restaurants by diners since 1979. Zagat 
publishes surveys for restaurants, hotels, 
and nightlife in 70 major cities. Zagat has come a long 
way from its roots in the early 1980s, when the food-
loving Zagats started compiling lists of their favorite 
restaurants for personal use and to share with their 
closest friends. But with the rise of the Internet, 
e-commerce, and mobile technology, Zagat has strug-
gled to find a business model that stayed true to the 
company’s origins.
To generate their first survey, the Zagats polled 
200 people, and increased that number over time. 
Executives, tourists, and New York foodies alike 
found the list to be indispensable. Spurred by this 
success, the Zagats decided to publish their survey 
themselves. The few booksellers that took a risk in 
stocking the book were rewarded with sales so robust 
that the Zagat Surveys became best sellers.
The pair also published similar lists for other 
major cities, including Chicago, San Francisco, 
and Washington, D.C. In addition to print books, 
Zagat opened a unit that creates custom guides for 
 corporate clients, like the ones at Citibank. For a long 
time, this business model was sufficient to ensure 
that Zagat Survey was successful and profitable.
When the dot-com bubble came along, venture 
capitalists were attracted to Zagat for its brand rec-
ognition—the Zagat name is instantly recognizable 
to food-lovers, travelers, and restaurateurs alike. 
Zagat was one of the first companies to popular-
ize user-generated content, collecting restaurant 
reviews from its readers, aggregating those reviews, 
and computing ratings. In addition to numeric rating 
scores, the survey also includes a short descriptive 
paragraph that incorporates selected quotations from 
several reviewers’ comments about each restaurant 
or service. Venture capitalists saw that Zagat had 
a golden opportunity to migrate its content from 
offline to online, Web, and mobile.
Of the many decisions the Zagats faced in  bringing 
their content to the Web, perhaps the most  important 
was how much to charge for various types of content. 
They ultimately decided to place all of their con-
tent behind a pay wall, relying on the Zagat brand 
to entice customers to purchase full online access. 
One of the most prominent members of the Zagat 
investment group was Nathan Myhrvold, formerly 
the chief technology officer at Microsoft. Myhrvold 
supported the Zagats’ decision to use a pay wall for 
their content and maintained that  putting all of their 
content online for free would have  undermined their 
book sales. 
Although Myhrvold and the Zagats themselves 
favored the pay wall, other Zagat investors argued 
that placing content online for free allowed compa-
nies like Yelp to get its results on the first page of 
Google search results, which is critical for maintain-
ing the strength of a brand in today’s advertising 
environment. By not taking this approach, Zagat left 
itself open to be surpassed by Yelp, Groupon, Google 
Places, and other similar services offering free con-
tent supported by advertising from local businesses. 
Sure enough, these companies soon began attracting 
numbers of online visitors that dwarfed Zagat’s.
In 2008, the Zagats tried to sell their company. 
They failed to do so, partially due to Yelp’s growing 
popularity. Prospective buyers were more intrigued 
by Yelp’s much larger online audience and growth 
potential. The Zagats’ failure to sell the company in 
2008 highlighted their failure to effectively go digi-
tal. Food blogs and similar sites abound on the Web 
nowadays, but Zagat was in a unique position to get 
there first and establish itself as a market leader, and 
it failed to do so. 
For much of 2011, Zagat continued to lag behind 
Yelp and other free review sites in the battle for 
 eyeballs. Yelp drew much greater traffic than Zagat.
com. From January to April 2012, Zagat.com had 
only 310,000 visitors, while Yelp had 31 million. The 
Zagat Web site claimed it has more users, but the dis-
parity was still significant.
Zagat saw its fortunes change in September 2011, 
when Google paid $151 million to buy the company. 
Although the Zagats had sought $200 million in 2008, 
the deal was considered by analysts to be generous. 
Google was seeking to establish itself in the local 
search marketspace, and after failing to purchase 
Yelp for $500 million in 2009, Zagat was next on their 
shopping list. In fact, after the Yelp deal fell through, 
Google and Yelp have become heated rivals, and Yelp 
has alleged that Google is rigging its search results to 
favor its own services over those of its competitors.
In the year following the acquisition, Google 
and Zagat worked together to allow Zagat reviews 
454 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

to appear alongside Google searches on various 
 platforms. Google wanted to use Zagat’s customer 
generated guide format and apply it to any place 
that can be searched for: restaurants, retail outlets, 
nightlife, hotels, resorts, spas, golf courses, and 
more. A growing percentage of Google searches are 
for information on nearby locations—20 percent of 
all searches, and 40 percent of that subset are made 
using mobile phones.
In May 2012, Google formally announced the 
inclusion of Zagat guides and online reviews in 
its new service, Google+ Local. With this service, 
Google hopes to more effectively compete with Yelp 
in local search. Because Google values eyeballs over 
all else, the company opted to remove the pay wall 
from Zagat content for the first time. Zagat had been 
charging $25 per year or $5 per month for access to 
its online reviews. Zagat will still charge $10 a year 
to use its iPhone app, and after a free six-month trial, 
it will charge $25 annually to see reviews on devices 
running Android. Still, normal Google searches on 
the Web will feature Zagat content for free, and 
Google is considering dropping the other subscrip-
tion fees for mobile devices. 
Google hopes to combine Zagat reviews with its 
mapping technology to better compete with Yelp. 
Trying out both services highlights some of the dif-
ferences between them. Zagat.com’s home page is 
streamlined, with a minimal number of search boxes 
and links immediately available. Restaurant reviews 
are organized by several major “hub” cities as well 
as popular lists of the top restaurants of a certain 
type. Clicking on a restaurant shows visitors a por-
tion of the data Zagat maintains on that restaurant. 
For example, the site now shows the percentage of 
users that “like” the restaurant, and several featured 
reviews. Many more reviews of the restaurant are 
available if the user wants to keep scrolling.
Yelp’s front page is much busier and less stream-
lined than Zagat’s, but has a great deal more content 
available immediately. The front page has lists of 
the most popular restaurants, retail outlets, bars and 
clubs, and many other categories, all free to the user. 
Looking for a dentist in New York City? Yelp has 
reviews of doctors and dentists that include videos 
put together by the practices to give visitors more 
information. Like Zagat.com, Yelp’s reviews are orga-
nized into a similar list of larger cities, but reviews 
exist for almost any location you can think of, includ-
ing less prominent cities and towns. Google is also 
working towards the goal of ubiquity.
Yelp’s strategy is to sell local advertisements wher-
ever businesses exist and to provide free content 
funded by these sales. Yelp has also relied more on 
individual reviewers. Instead of distilling reviews 
into one coherent whole, as Zagat’s does, Yelp allows 
its reviewers to post full, unaltered reviews, which 
allows top reviewers to gain followings and even 
receive invitations to special events. The drawback 
of this approach is that many reviews are far longer 
than necessary and individual reviews may  contain 
distortions or false claims designed to damage 
reputations. Zagat reviews give a clearer and more 
concise impression of a restaurant than most Yelp 
reviews, and they are aggregated and given a score.
Investors believe that Yelp is on “a different 
 trajectory” because of its unique business model. 
Zagat sold content to consumers and corporations; 
Yelp sells advertising to local businesses. Many 
 analysts believe there is much more potential for 
growth with Yelp’s business model than with Zagat’s 
old model because it is a useful advertising vehicle 
for small businesses everywhere, not just major cit-
ies. Zagat may also have hurt itself with its slow 
response to the emergence of the mobile digital 
platform.
Most analysts agree that Zagat could have avoided 
this state of affairs by making a more aggressive effort 
to go digital. The choice to use a pay wall may be 
the biggest culprit. But did it necessarily hurt Zagat’s 
 bottom line? The company has always been profitable, 
according to Tim and Nina Zagat. Other successful 
Web sites have used a pay wall. Zagat book revenue 
is still strong—the New York survey is still on the 
New York nonfiction best-seller list, and its corporate 
 custom guide unit is very profitable. Despite their 
acquisition by Google, the Zagats plan to continue to 
publish their physical books. Nevertheless, it’s also 
possible that going with a pay wall before establishing 
a loyal online audience may not be the right time to 
make the move towards a paid model.
So far, the pairing of Google and Zagat has been 
successful, and will allow the two companies to 
 better compete with Yelp in local search. But Google 
also hopes that incorporating Zagat’s user-generated 
content model into Google+ will help its fledgling 
social network to better compete with Facebook by 
providing uniquely valuable services to its users. 
Google envisions Google+ users searching for “pizza” 
and being given a map with the closest  pizzerias 
marked with Zagat reviews, some of which may be 
written by their friends on the network. In 2014, 
Google made big changes to Zagat’s app, introduc-
ing a host of new features and a completely updated 
design, as well as limiting the number of cities where 
the app would work. New filtering options allow 
 
Chapter 10 E-commerce: Digital Markets, Digital Goods 
455

users to perform more granular searches for specific 
types of restaurants, sorting by style, cost, location, 
or rating. For Google, acquiring Zagat was just one of 
a myriad of acquisitions they made in 2011; but from 
Zagat’s perspective, its acquisition represents another 
phase in a long e-commerce journey, and illustrates 
the difficulty of developing just the right business 
model for your company.

ew industries have experienced as much disruption due to the finan-
cial meltdown of 2007–2009 as the auto industry. Global production 
peaked in 2007 when 53 million cars were produced, but fell to 47 mil-
lion two years later at the height of the global financial recession. Two 
large American firms, General Motors and Chrysler, required a financial bail 
out of €5.6 billion from the United States government. After filing for bank-
ruptcy in 2009, Chrysler found a buyer in Fiat Automobiles S.p.A., who even-
tually purchased majority control by 2011, and has since attempted to pur-
chase all the shares from the Canadian government, and employee unions in 
2013. 
Fiat was one of the global automotive companies to weather the finan-
cial storm of 2008–2011 without significant government intervention.  The 
114-year-old automaker is based in Turin, Italy, and is Italy’s largest auto man-
ufacturer, with 9 percent of the European market. Its second largest market 
is Brazil, where it has been the market leader for a decade.  The combined 
Chrysler Fiat company has nearly 215,000 employees, 158 plants, and 77 R&D 
centers.  Fiat’s  2012 revenue approached €84 billion. In 2014, Fiat Chrysler 
shifted to incorporation under Dutch Law, moved its headquarters to the 
United Kingdom, and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, indicating a 
strong move towards becoming a more global company.
Fiat faced several information system challenges resulting from its global 
expansion, and in particular its purchase of Chrysler.  In the past, Fiat global 
production centers adopted their own database systems to manage their busi-
ness, and these legacy systems evolved independently over many years.  
FIAT: REAL TIME MANAGEMENT WITH BUSINESS 
INTELLIGENCE

Even enterprise systems from a single vendor differed by country and market, 
making compatibility and reporting a challenge for executives.  This meant that 
executives in Turin could not receive timely and complete information on the 
firm’s key business processes and financial performance. A good deal of man-
agement decision making relied on manual spreadsheets using data from dif-
ferent systems, and this led to errors in the data. With Chrysler, Fiat inherited 
another set of enterprise systems. All business functions were impacted, from 
supply management and production to marketing and finance. Financial man-
agers required a detailed planning capability. Selling Fiat 500s in the United 
States and Jeeps throughout Europe made it very difficult to identify the poten-
tial cost savings of sharing parts and products across these brands. 
Fiat decided it needed a new system that could provide near real-time infor-
mation on its operations across the globe to integrate control and reporting, 
data definitions, pricing, and marketing campaigns for new vehicles. Working 
with Oracle’s Hyperion database and reporting software, and the consulting 
firm TechEdge SpA, Fiat set out to build an enterprise performance manage-
ment system with significant business intelligence capabilities based on cur-
rent data from the divisions. 
The new system allows Fiat managers to analyze automobile production 
across divisions, including the motors used, and vehicle options.  In turn this 
enables executives to define the costs and budgets of production worldwide.  
Manual work with spreadsheets has been greatly reduced.  Using Oracle’s 
Hyperion Planning system, Fiat managers are able to develop a detailed under-
standing of local market conditions and initiate marketing campaigns and 
incentive programs to ensure that excess inventories of completed cars do not 
pile up. 
Oracle’s Hyperion Financial Management provided an integrated platform 
for managing government reporting requirements, and the ability to trace and 
audit assembly and sales by providing a detailed view of dealer sales to final 
customers. For marketing, the new system enabled Fiat managers to simu-
late sales volumes and costs, and compared marketing expenditures in each 
market to sales results. In contrast to previous legacy systems, the enterprise 
performance system is Web-enabled and reduces reliance on individual PCs. 
An important element of the new system is making data and information more 
understandable by creating performance dashboards for managers that reflect 
their needs as decision makers. These new user interfaces are essential ele-
ments for using the data effectively in a competitive environment.

he experiences of Fiat provide an excellent of example of the challenges 
that businesses face when increasing their scope of operations and mov-

very difficult to coordinate supply chain, production, financial, and marketing 
decisions on a global basis.  Existing systems could not provide real-time data to 
central management in Turin, and did not have the analytical power to analyze 
the data from these legacy systems.  In this traditional climate, management

11.1 WHAT IS THE ROLE OF KNOWLEDGE 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN BUSINESS?
K
nowledge management and collaboration systems are among the  fastest 
 growing areas of corporate and government software  investment. The 
past decade has shown an explosive growth in research on knowledge 
and knowledge management in the  economics, management, and 
information systems fields.
Knowledge management and collaboration are closely related. Knowledge 
that cannot be communicated and shared with others is nearly useless. 
Knowledge becomes useful and actionable when shared throughout the firm. 
had a difficult time responding to changes in local conditions, and discovering 
potential synergies among their divisions.
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter.  To operate efficiently on a global scale, firms need 
more timely and accurate data to make intelligent decisions.  They also need 
sophisticated analytic packages that can make sense of the data, provide cap-
sule summaries to management, and provide interfaces that managers can 
easily use.  With these systems, managers are able to see where production 
bottlenecks occur, understand how their various divisions can cooperate by 
sharing parts and designs, and respond to changes in demand and avoid excess 
inventories.  Better decision making using business intelligence makes compa-
nies like Fiat more profitable.
Here are some questions to think about: Why is it important that global per-
formance management be delivered using Web-based technologies rather than 
traditional software running on corporate servers and PCs?  What people and 
organizational difficulties do you think firms will face when implementing 
these global systems?  Do firms become too dependent on database firms like 
Oracle?
 
Chapter 11 Managing Knowledge 
461

We have already described the major tools for collaboration and social  business 
in Chapter 2. In this chapter, we will focus on knowledge  management 
 systems, and be mindful that communicating and sharing  knowledge are 
becoming increasingly important.
We live in an information economy in which the major source of wealth and 
prosperity is the production and distribution of information and knowledge. An 
estimated 37 percent of the U.S. labor force consists of knowledge and informa-
tion workers, the largest single segment of the labor force. About 45 percent 
of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States is generated by the 
knowledge and information sectors (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2012). 
Knowledge management has become an important theme at many large busi-
ness firms as managers realize that much of their firm’s value depends on the 
firm’s ability to create and manage knowledge. Studies have found that a substan-
tial part of a firm’s stock market value is related to its intangible assets, of which 
knowledge is one important component, along with brands, reputations, and 
unique business processes. Well-executed knowledge-based projects have been 
known to produce extraordinary returns on investment, although the impacts of 
knowledge-based investments are difficult to measure (Gu and Lev, 2001).
IMPORTANT DIMENSIONS OF KNOWLEDGE
There is an important distinction between data, information, knowledge, and 
wisdom. Chapter 1 defines data as a flow of events or transactions captured by 
an organization’s systems that, by itself, is useful for transacting but little else. 
To turn data into useful information, a firm must expend resources to  organize 
data into categories of understanding, such as monthly, daily, regional, or
store-based reports of total sales. To transform information into knowledge, a 
firm must expend additional resources to discover patterns, rules, and contexts 
where the knowledge works. Finally, wisdom is thought to be the collective 
and individual experience of applying knowledge to the solution of problems. 
Wisdom involves where, when, and how to apply knowledge.
Knowledge is both an individual attribute and a collective attribute of the 
firm. Knowledge is a cognitive, even a physiological, event that takes place 
inside people’s heads. It is also stored in libraries and records, shared in 
 lectures, and stored by firms in the form of business processes and employee 
know-how. Knowledge residing in the minds of employees that has not been 
documented is called tacit knowledge, whereas knowledge that has been 
documented is called explicit knowledge. Knowledge can reside in e-mail, 
voice mail, graphics, and unstructured documents as well as structured 
 documents. Knowledge is generally believed to have a location, either in the 
minds of humans or in specific business processes. Knowledge is “sticky” and 
not universally applicable or easily moved. Finally, knowledge is thought to 
be situational and contextual. For example, you must know when to perform 
a procedure as well as how to perform it. Table 11.1 reviews these dimensions 
of knowledge.
We can see that knowledge is a different kind of firm asset from, say, 
 buildings and financial assets; that knowledge is a complex phenomenon; and 
that there are many aspects to the process of managing knowledge. We can also 
recognize that knowledge-based core competencies of firms—the two or three 
things that an organization does best—are key organizational assets. Knowing 
how to do things effectively and efficiently in ways that other organizations 
cannot duplicate is a primary source of profit and competitive advantage that 
cannot be purchased easily by competitors in the marketplace.
462 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

For instance, having a unique build-to-order production system constitutes 
a form of knowledge and perhaps a unique asset that other firms cannot copy 
easily. With knowledge, firms become more efficient and effective in their use 
of scarce resources. Without knowledge, firms become less efficient and less 
effective in their use of resources and ultimately fail.
Organizational Learning and Knowledge Management
Like humans, organizations create and gather knowledge using a variety 
of organizational learning mechanisms. Through collection of data,  careful 
 measurement of planned activities, trial and error (experiment), and 
 feedback from customers and the environment in general, organizations 
gain  experience. Organizations that learn adjust their behavior to reflect 
that  learning by  creating new business processes and by changing patterns 
of management decision making. This process of change is called organiza-
tional learning. Arguably, organizations that can sense and respond to their 
environments rapidly will survive longer than organizations that have poor 
learning mechanisms.
THE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT VALUE CHAIN
Knowledge management refers to the set of business processes developed in 
an organization to create, store, transfer, and apply knowledge. Knowledge man-
agement increases the ability of the organization to learn from its  environment 
and to incorporate knowledge into its business processes. Figure 11.1 illustrates 
the five value-adding steps in the knowledge management value chain. Each 
stage in the value chain adds value to raw data and information as they are 
transformed into usable knowledge.
TABLE 11.1 IMPORTANT DIMENSIONS OF KNOWLEDGE
KNOWLEDGE IS A FIRM ASSET
Knowledge is an intangible asset.
The transformation of data into useful information and knowledge requires organizational resources.
Knowledge is not subject to the law of diminishing returns as are physical assets, but instead experiences 
network effects as its value increases as more people share it.
KNOWLEDGE HAS DIFFERENT FORMS
Knowledge can be either tacit or explicit (codified).
Knowledge involves know-how, craft, and skill.
Knowledge involves knowing how to follow procedures.
Knowledge involves knowing why, not simply when, things happen (causality).
KNOWLEDGE HAS A LOCATION
Knowledge is a cognitive event involving mental models and maps of individuals.
There is both a social and an individual basis of knowledge.
Knowledge is “sticky” (hard to move), situated (enmeshed in a firm’s culture), and contextual (works only 
in certain situations).
KNOWLEDGE IS SITUATIONAL
Knowledge is conditional; knowing when to apply a procedure is just as important as knowing the 
procedure (conditional).
Knowledge is related to context; you must know how to use a certain tool and under what circumstances.

In Figure 11.1, information systems activities are separated from related 
 management and organizational activities, with information systems activities on 
the top of the graphic and organizational and management activities below. One 
apt slogan of the knowledge management field is, “Effective knowledge manage-
ment is 80 percent managerial and organizational, and 20 percent technology.”
In Chapter 1, we define organizational and management capital as the set of 
business processes, culture, and behavior required to obtain value from invest-
ments in information systems. In the case of knowledge management, as with 
other information systems investments, supportive values, structures, and 
behavior patterns must be built to maximize the return on investment in knowl-
edge management projects. In Figure 11.1, the management and organizational 
activities in the lower half of the diagram represent the investment in organiza-
tional capital required to obtain substantial returns on the information technol-
ogy (IT) investments and systems shown in the top half of the diagram.
Knowledge Acquisition
Organizations acquire knowledge in a number of ways, depending on the type 
of knowledge they seek. The first knowledge management systems sought 
to build corporate repositories of documents, reports, presentations, and best 
practices. These efforts have been extended to include unstructured documents 
(such as e-mail). In other cases, organizations acquire knowledge by developing 
online expert networks so that employees can “find the expert” in the company 
who is personally knowledgeable.
In still other cases, firms must create new knowledge by discovering patterns 
in corporate data or by using knowledge workstations where engineers can 
discover new knowledge. These various efforts are described throughout this 
 FIGURE 11.1  THE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT VALUE CHAIN
Knowledge management today involves both information systems activities and a host of enabling management and organiza-
tional activities.

chapter. A coherent and organized knowledge system also requires systematic 
data from the firm’s transaction processing systems that track sales,  payments, 
inventory, customers, and other vital data, as well as data from external sources 
such as news feeds, industry reports, legal opinions, scientific research, and 
government statistics.
Knowledge Storage
Once they are discovered, documents, patterns, and expert rules must be stored 
so they can be retrieved and used by employees. Knowledge storage  generally 
involves the creation of a database. Document management systems that digi-
tize, index, and tag documents according to a coherent framework are large 
databases adept at storing collections of documents. Expert systems also help 
corporations preserve the knowledge that is acquired by incorporating that 
knowledge into organizational processes and culture. Each of these is discussed 
later in this chapter and in the following chapter.
Management must support the development of planned knowledge storage 
systems, encourage the development of corporate-wide schemas for index-
ing documents, and reward employees for taking the time to update and store 
 documents properly. For instance, it would reward the sales force for submit-
ting names of prospects to a shared corporate database of prospects where all 
sales personnel can identify each prospect and review the stored knowledge.
Knowledge Dissemination
Portals, e-mail, instant messaging, wikis, social business tools, and search 
engines technology have added to an existing array of collaboration tools for 
sharing calendars, documents, data, and graphics (see Chapter 2). Contemporary 
technology seems to have created a deluge of information and knowledge. How 
can managers and employees discover, in a sea of information and knowledge, 
that which is really important for their decisions and their work? Here, training 
programs, informal networks, and shared management experience communi-
cated through a supportive culture help managers focus their attention on the 
important knowledge and information.
Knowledge Application
Regardless of what type of knowledge management system is involved, 
 knowledge that is not shared and applied to the practical problems facing firms 
and managers does not add business value. To provide a return on  investment, 
organizational knowledge must become a systematic part of  management 
 decision making and become situated in systems for decision support (described 
in Chapter 12). Ultimately, new knowledge must be built into a firm’s  business 
processes and key application systems, including enterprise applications for 
managing key internal business processes and relationships with customers 
and suppliers. Management supports this process by creating—based on new 
knowledge—new business practices, new products and services, and new 
 markets for the firm.
Building Organizational and Management Capital: 
Collaboration, Communities of Practice, and Office 
Environments
In addition to the activities we have just described, managers can help by 
 developing new organizational roles and responsibilities for the acquisition 
of knowledge, including the creation of chief knowledge officer executive 
 positions, dedicated staff positions (knowledge managers), and communities 
 
Chapter 11 Managing Knowledge 
465

of practice. Communities of practice (COPs) are informal social networks 
of professionals and employees within and outside the firm who have  similar 
work-related activities and interests. The activities of these communities include 
self- education and group education, conferences, online newsletters, and day-
to-day sharing of experiences and techniques to solve specific work problems. 
Many organizations, such as IBM, the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, 
and the World Bank have encouraged the development of thousands of online 
communities of practice. These communities of practice depend greatly on 
software environments that enable collaboration and communication.
COPs can make it easier for people to reuse knowledge by pointing commu-
nity members to useful documents, creating document repositories, and filter-
ing information for newcomers. COPs members act as facilitators, encouraging 
contributions and discussion. COPs can also reduce the learning curve for new 
employees by providing contacts with subject matter experts and access to a 
community’s established methods and tools. Finally, COPs can act as a spawn-
ing ground for new ideas, techniques, and decision- making behavior.
TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
There are essentially three major types of knowledge management systems: 
enterprise-wide knowledge management systems, knowledge work systems, 
and intelligent techniques. Figure 11.2 shows the knowledge management 
system applications for each of these major categories.
Enterprise-wide knowledge management systems are general-purpose 
firmwide efforts to collect, store, distribute, and apply digital content and 
knowledge. These systems include capabilities for searching for information, 
storing both structured and unstructured data, and locating employee exper-
tise within the firm. They also include supporting technologies such as portals, 
search engines, collaboration and social business tools, and learning manage-
ment systems.
 FIGURE 11.2  MAJOR TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
There are three major categories of knowledge management systems, and each can be broken down further into more specialized types of 
knowledge management systems.
466 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

The development of powerful networked workstations and software for 
assisting engineers and scientists in the discovery of new knowledge has led 
to the creation of knowledge work systems such as computer-aided design 
(CAD), visualization, simulation, and virtual reality systems. Knowledge work 
 systems (KWS) are specialized systems built for engineers, scientists, and other 
knowledge workers charged with discovering and creating new knowledge for 
a company. We discuss knowledge work applications in detail in Section 11.3.
Knowledge management also includes a diverse group of intelligent 
 techniques, such as data mining, expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy logic, 
genetic algorithms, and intelligent agents. These techniques have different objec-
tives, from a focus on discovering knowledge (data mining and neural networks), 
to distilling knowledge in the form of rules for a computer program (expert sys-
tems and fuzzy logic), to discovering optimal solutions for problems (genetic 
algorithms). Section 11.4 provides more detail about these intelligent techniques.
11.2 WHAT TYPES OF SYSTEMS ARE USED FOR 
ENTERPRISE-WIDE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT 
AND HOW DO THEY PROVIDE VALUE FOR 
BUSINESSES?
Firms must deal with at least three kinds of knowledge. Some knowledge exists 
within the firm in the form of structured text documents (reports and presen-
tations). Decision makers also need knowledge that is semistructured, such as
e-mail, voice mail, chat room exchanges, videos, digital pictures, brochures, 
or bulletin board postings. In still other cases, there is no formal or digital 
information of any kind, and the knowledge resides in the heads of employ-
ees. Much of this knowledge is tacit knowledge that is rarely written down. 
Enterprise-wide knowledge management systems deal with all three types of 
knowledge.
ENTERPRISE CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
Businesses today need to organize and manage both structured and semistruc-
tured knowledge assets. Structured knowledge is explicit knowledge that 
exists in formal documents, as well as in formal rules that organizations derive 
by observing experts and their decision-making behaviors. But, according to 
experts, at least 80 percent of an organization’s business content is semistruc-
tured or unstructured—information in folders, messages, memos, proposals,
e-mails, graphics, electronic slide presentations, and even videos created in 
 different formats and stored in many locations.
Enterprise content management systems help organizations manage 
both types of information. They have capabilities for knowledge capture, 
 storage, retrieval, distribution, and preservation to help firms improve their 
business processes and decisions. Such systems include corporate repositories 
of documents, reports, presentations, and best practices, as well as  capabilities 
for collecting and organizing semistructured knowledge such as e-mail
(see Figure 11.3). Major enterprise content management systems also enable 
users to access external sources of information, such as news feeds and 
research, and to communicate via e-mail, chat/instant messaging, discussion 
groups, and videoconferencing. They are starting to incorporate blogs, wikis, 
and other enterprise social networking tools. Open Text Corporation, EMC

 FIGURE 11.3  AN ENTERPRISE CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
An enterprise content management system has capabilities for classifying, organizing, and managing 
structured and semistructured knowledge and making it available throughout the enterprise.
(Documentum), IBM, and Oracle Corporation are leading vendors of enterprise 
content management software.
Calgary is the largest city in Alberta and the third largest municipality in 
Canada, with a population exceeding 1.1 million. Its 15,000 employees use 
OpenText Content Suite Platform to manage and share many different kinds 
of documents to provide essential services to citizens. Content Suite helps 
the city capture content it can actually track. Once a workspace is established 
in Content Server, the system automatically classifies documents, including 
graphic  content, according to record type, retention requirements, and who 
in the  organization is responsible for the document. Content created by one 
workgroup is easily accessible by other workgroups. Content Suite helped 
the city establish a strong records management program that supports groups 
with different needs. For example, Calgary’s legal department and Freedom of 
Information Group places top priority on control and governance. Its Security 
team and City Council are more concerned with the separation between public 
documents and maintenance of confidential content. Business units with users 
in the field need an easy way to access the information they need while they 
are on the go. Content Suite is able to manage Calgary’s content to meet each 
group’s most important information requirements (OpenText 2013–2014).
A key problem in managing knowledge is the creation of an appropriate 
 classification scheme, or taxonomy, to organize information into meaningful 
categories so that it can be easily accessed. Once the categories for classifying 
knowledge have been created, each knowledge object needs to be “tagged,” or 
classified, so that it can be easily retrieved. Enterprise content management 
systems have capabilities for tagging, interfacing with corporate databases and 
content repositories, and creating enterprise knowledge portals that provide a 
single point of access to information resources.
Firms in publishing, advertising, broadcasting, and entertainment have 
 special needs for storing and managing unstructured digital data such as photo-
graphs, graphic images, video, and audio content. For example, Coca-Cola must 
468 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

keep track of all the images of the Coca-Cola brand that have been created in 
the past at all of the company’s worldwide offices, to prevent both redundant 
work and variation from a standard brand image. Digital asset management 
systems help companies classify, store, and distribute these digital objects.
LOCATING AND SHARING EXPERTISE
Some of the knowledge businesses need is not in the form of a digital 
 document but instead resides in the memory of individual experts in the firm. 
Contemporary enterprise content management systems, along with the  systems 
for collaboration and social business introduced in Chapter 2, have capabili-
ties for locating experts and tapping their knowledge. These include online 
directories of corporate experts and their profiles, with details about their job 
experience, projects, publications, and educational degrees, and  repositories of 
expert-generated content. Specialized search tools make it easier for employees 
to find the appropriate expert in a company. 
For knowledge resources outside the firm, social networking and social 
 business tools enable users to bookmark Web pages of interest, tag these book-
marks with keywords, and share the tags and Web page links with other people. 
These bookmarks are often public on sites such as Delicious and Reddit, but 
some can be saved privately and shared only with specified people or groups.
LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
Companies need ways to keep track of and manage employee learning and to 
integrate it more fully into their knowledge management and other  corporate 
systems. A learning management system (LMS) provides tools for the 
 management, delivery, tracking, and assessment of various types of employee 
learning and training.
Contemporary LMS support multiple modes of learning, including
CD-ROM, downloadable videos, Web-based classes, live instruction in classes 
or online, and group learning in online forums and chat sessions. The LMS 
 consolidates mixed-media training, automates the selection and administration 
of courses, assembles and delivers learning content, and measures  learning 
effectiveness.
CVM Solutions, LLC (CVM) uses Digitec’s Knowledge Direct learning 
 management system to provide training about how to manage suppliers for 
clients such as Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, and Delta Airlines. 
Knowledge Direct provides a portal for accessing course content online, along 
with hands-free administration features such as student registration and assess-
ment tools, built-in Help and Contact Support, automatic e-mail triggers to 
remind users of courses or deadlines, automatic e-mail acknowledgement of 
course completions, and Web-based reporting for courses accessed.
Businesses run their own learning management systems, but they are also 
turning to publicly-available massive open online courses (MOOCs) to 
 educate their employees. A MOOC is an online course made available via the Web 
to very large numbers of participants. For example, in March 2013 employees 
from General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, Samsung, and Walmart were among 
over 90,000 learners from 143 countries enrolled in Foundations for Business 
Strategy, a MOOC offered through the Coursera online learning  platform by the 
University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business (Nurmohamed, Gillani, and 
Lenox, 2013).

11.3 WHAT ARE THE MAJOR TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE 
WORK SYSTEMS AND HOW DO THEY PROVIDE 
VALUE FOR FIRMS?
The enterprise-wide knowledge systems we have just described provide a 
wide range of capabilities that can be used by many if not all the workers and 
groups in an organization. Firms also have specialized systems for knowledge 
 workers to help them create new knowledge and to ensure that this knowledge 
is  properly integrated into the business.
KNOWLEDGE WORKERS AND KNOWLEDGE WORK
Knowledge workers, which we introduced in Chapter 1, include researchers, 
designers, architects, scientists, and engineers who primarily create knowledge 
and information for the organization. Knowledge workers usually have high 
levels of education and memberships in professional organizations and are 
often asked to exercise independent judgment as a routine aspect of their work. 
For example, knowledge workers create new products or find ways of improv-
ing existing ones. Knowledge workers perform three key roles that are critical 
to the organization and to the managers who work within the organization:
• Keeping the organization current in knowledge as it develops in the external 
world—in technology, science, social thought, and the arts
• Serving as internal consultants regarding the areas of their knowledge, the 
changes taking place, and opportunities
• Acting as change agents, evaluating, initiating, and promoting change 
projects
REQUIREMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE WORK SYSTEMS
Most knowledge workers rely on office systems, such as word processors, voice 
mail, e-mail, videoconferencing, and scheduling systems, which are designed 
to increase worker productivity in the office. However, knowledge workers also 
require highly specialized knowledge work systems with powerful graphics, 
analytical tools, and communications and document management capabilities.
These systems require sufficient computing power to handle the sophisti-
cated graphics or complex calculations necessary for such knowledge  workers 
as scientific researchers, product designers, and financial analysts. Because 
knowledge workers are so focused on knowledge in the external world, these 
systems also must give the worker quick and easy access to external databases. 
They typically feature user-friendly interfaces that enable users to perform 
needed tasks without having to spend a great deal of time learning how to use 
the system. Knowledge workers are highly paid—wasting a knowledge work-
er’s time is simply too expensive. Figure 11.4 summarizes the requirements of 
knowledge work systems.
Knowledge workstations often are designed and optimized for the specific 
tasks to be performed; so, for example, a design engineer requires a different 
workstation setup than a financial analyst. Design engineers need graphics 
with enough power to handle three-dimensional (3-D) CAD systems. However, 
financial analysts are more interested in access to a myriad number of  external 
databases and large databases for efficiently storing and accessing massive 
amounts of financial data.
470 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

EXAMPLES OF KNOWLEDGE WORK SYSTEMS
Major knowledge work applications include CAD systems, virtual reality 
 systems for simulation and modeling, and financial workstations. Computer-
aided design (CAD) automates the creation and revision of designs, using 
 computers and sophisticated graphics software. Using a more traditional 
 physical design methodology, each design modification requires a mold to be 
made and a  prototype to be tested physically. That process must be repeated 
many times, which is a very expensive and time- consuming process. Using a 
CAD  workstation, the designer need only make a physical prototype toward the 
end of the design process because the design can be easily tested and changed 
on the  computer. The ability of CAD software to provide design specifications 
for the tooling and  manufacturing processes also saves a great deal of time and 
money while producing a manufacturing process with far fewer problems.
For example, Ford Motor Company used a computer simulation to create an 
engine cylinder that came up with the most efficient design possible. Engineers 
altered that design to account for manufacturing constraints and tested the 
revised design virtually in models that used decades of data on material proper-
ties and engine performance. Ford then created the mold to make a real part 
that could be bolted onto an engine for further testing. The entire process took 
days instead of months and cost thousands of dollars instead of millions. 
CAD systems are able to supply data for 3-D printing, also known as  additive 
manufacturing, which uses machines to make solid objects, layer by layer, from 
specifications in a digital file. 3-D printing is currently being used for producing 
prototypes and customized manufacturing work (see the Interactive Session on 
Technology).
Virtual reality systems have visualization, rendering, and simulation 
 capabilities that go far beyond those of conventional CAD systems. They

Nev Hyman had been building surf boards in 
Australia for 35 years. In 2005, he teamed up with 
Mark Price and a group of longtime surfing friends 
in Carlsbad, California, to form Firewire Surfboards. 
This company thrives on innovation and was respon-
sible for the first major change in surfboard com-
position and  assembly  methods in 40 years. Rather 
than polyurethane resin and polyurethane foam, 
Firewire’s boards were  composed of expanded poly-
styrene (EPS) foam and epoxy  resins. Hyman and 
Price believed that this  composition for the surf-
board core, along with  aerospace composites for the 
deck skin and balsa wood rails (the outside edge), 
created a more flexible and maneuverable product 
that would attract top  surfers and set Firewire apart 
from its competitors. 
FireWire is competing in a crowded field 
that includes Isle Surf boards, Surftech, Aviso 
Surf, Boardworks Surf, Channel Island, and Lost 
Enterprises. FireWire is alone in the reintroduc-
tion of balsa wood to the board rails for added flex 
response time and the ability to maintain speed 
during precarious maneuvers. Firewire believes it 
can compete successfully because its surf boards 
are far lighter, stronger, and more flexible than 
those of competitors. An additional selling point 
is the reduced environmental impact: Firewire’s 
materials emit only 2 percent of the harmful com-
pounds of traditional boards and recycling excess 
EPS foam has earned Firewire international awards 
and acclaim.
But that isn’t enough. To make sure it stays ahead 
of the competition, Firewire decided to start making 
custom surfboards instead of just the usual off-the-
rack sizes. For the everyday surfer, the durability 
and flexbility of Firewire’s materials was a key sell-
ing point. However, custom boards made to surfer 
specifications are critical in the elite surfboard mar-
ket, and the ability to claim top-level competitive 
surfers as customers drives the broader surfboard 
market as well. 
Traditionally, skilled craftsmen called shapers 
designed and built surfboards by hand, but Firewire 
started doing some of this work using computer-
aided designs (CAD) sent to cutting facilities. The 
company’s computer-aided manufacturing process 
returned to the shaper a board that was 85–90 per-
cent complete, leaving the artisan to complete the 
customization and the lamination process.
According to Price, who became Firewire’s 
CEO, there are 29 time-consuming and labor inten-
sive steps in the surfboard manufacturing process. 
Initially, the multifaceted manufacturing process 
made it impossible to offer personalized CAD to 
the average consumer. Customized boards could 
only be produced for elite competitive customers. 
There was no way to offer customization to a wider 
 market without overburdening Firewire’s CAD 
system. Moreover, most custom boards had to be 
ordered by filling out a piece of paper with vari-
ous dimensions for the requested changes. There 
was no way to see a visual representation of these 
adjustments or assess their impact on the board’s 
volume, which directly affects buoyancy, paddling 
ability, and  performance. 
Firewire needed a system that would allow cus-
tomers to experiment with established designs, feed 
the CAD process, and integrate it with its computer 
numerical control (CNC) manufacturing process. 
Enter ShapeLogic Design-to-Order Live! For NX, 
which provides an online customization system with 
a Web-based user interface and advanced 3D CAD 
tools.
Firew ire 
st ar ted 
work ing 
w ith 
the 
ShapeLogicNX software in 2009 to develop its own 
Firewire Surfboards’ Custom Board Design (CBD) 
system, which allows users to easily manipulate 
board dimensions of established models within 
design parameters. Any registered customer can 
choose a standard Firewire model and use drag-
and-drop tools to adjust the board’s length, mid-
point width, nose width, tail width, and thickness, 
as long as these changes don’t degrade the board’s 
design integrity. CBD generates a precise 3D model 
of the stock model used as the base design along 
with a 3D portable document format (PDF) file of 
the customized board. The PDF file documents the 
board’s dimensions and volume. A customer can 
manipulate the model from all angles and com-
pare the customized board to the standard board 
to fully understand the design before placing an 
order. When the customer uses the system to order 
a custom board, CBD generates a precise solid CAD 
model of the board that is transmitted directly to 
the Firewire factory for driving the CNC machines 
that manufacture the board. 
This combination of technologies results in a 
board that is 97 percent complete, minimizing the

manufacturing time, finishing process, and thus, 
costs to the consumer. In contrast to the earlier CAD 
assisted, 10–15 percent hand-finished boards, once a 
surfer has designed the board of his or her dreams, 
it can be remade to those exact specifications time 
and again. Neither the ideal handmade board nor 
a shaper-finished board can be replicated with this 
degree of precision. 
An additional benefit of Firewire’s online design 
system is the social networking engendered by the 
sharing of customers’ unique design files. Before 
placing an order, customers can show their modi-
fications to fellow surfers and ask for opinions and 
advice. After placing an order and using the product, 
they can report their experiences and (hopefully) 
tout their design or suggest improvements to other 
customers. Interactive communication such as this

use interactive graphics software to create computer-generated simulations 
that are so close to reality that users almost believe they are participating in 
a  real-world situation. In many virtual reality systems, the user dons special 
clothing,  headgear, and equipment, depending on the application. The clothing 
 contains sensors that record the user’s movements and immediately transmit 
that  information back to the computer. For instance, to walk through a virtual 
reality simulation of a house, you would need garb that monitors the  movement 
of your feet, hands, and head. You also would need goggles containing video 
screens and sometimes audio attachments and feeling gloves so that you can be 
immersed in the computer feedback.
At NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, students wearing 3-D 
glasses are able to “dissect” a virtual cadaver projected on a screen. With the 
help of a computer, they can move through the virtual body, scrutinizing layers 
of muscles or watching a close-up of a pumping heart along with bright red 
arteries and deep blue veins. The virtual human body was created by BioDigital 
Systems, a New York City medical visualization firm. The virtual cadaver being 
used at Langone is a beta version that BioDigital plans to develop into a search-
able,  customizable map of the human body for medical educators and physi-
cians. NYU medical school has no current plans to phase out dissection, but the 
3-D virtual cadaver is a valuable complementary teaching tool (Singer, 2012). 
Ford Motor Company has been using virtual reality to help design its vehi-
cles. In one example of Ford’s Immersive Virtual Environment, a designer 
 
Chapter 11 Managing Knowledge 
473

was presented with a car seat, steering wheel, and blank dashboard. Wearing 
virtual reality glasses and gloves with sensors, the designer was able to “sit” in 
the seat surrounded by the vehicle's 3-D design to experience how a proposed 
interior would look and feel. The designer would be able to identify blind 
spots or see if knobs were in an awkward place. Ford’s designers could also 
use this technology to see the impact of a design on manufacturing. For exam-
ple, is a bolt that assembly line workers need to tighten too hard to reach? 
Augmented reality (AR) is a related technology for enhancing visualization. 
AR provides a live direct or indirect view of a physical real-world  environment 
whose elements are augmented by virtual computer-generated imagery. The user 
is grounded in the real physical world, and the virtual images are merged with the 
real view to create the augmented display. The digital technology  provides addi-
tional information to enhance the perception of reality, making the surrounding 
real world of the user more interactive and meaningful. The yellow first-down 
markers shown on televised football games are examples of augmented reality 
as are medical procedures like image-guided surgery, where data acquired from 
computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or 
from ultrasound imaging are superimposed on the patient in the operating room. 
Other industries where AR has caught on include military training, engineering 
design, robotics, and consumer design.
Virtual reality applications developed for the Web use a standard called 
Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML). VRML is a set of specifica-
tions for interactive, 3-D modeling on the World Wide Web that can organize 
multiple media types, including animation, images, and audio to put users in 
a  simulated real-world environment. VRML is platform independent, operates 
over a desktop computer, and requires little bandwidth.
DuPont, the Wilmington, Delaware, chemical company, created a VRML 
application called HyperPlant, which enables users to access 3-D data over the 
Internet using Web browser software. Engineers can go through 3-D models as 
if they were physically walking through a plant, viewing objects at eye level. 
This level of detail reduces the number of mistakes they make during construc-
tion of oil rigs, oil plants, and other structures.
The financial industry is using specialized investment workstations such 
as Bloomberg Terminals to leverage the knowledge and time of its brokers, trad-
ers, and portfolio  managers. Firms such as Merrill Lynch and UBS Financial 
Services have installed  investment workstations that integrate a wide range of 
data from both  internal and external sources, including contact management 
data, real-time and  historical market data, and research reports. Previously,

arate systems and piecing together the information they needed. By providing

11.4 WHAT ARE THE BUSINESS BENEFITS OF USING 
INTELLIGENT TECHNIQUES FOR KNOWLEDGE 
MANAGEMENT?
Artificial intelligence and database technology provide a number of intelli-
gent techniques that organizations can use to capture individual and  collective 
knowledge and to extend their knowledge base. Expert systems, case-based 
474 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

reasoning, and fuzzy logic are used for capturing tacit knowledge. Neural 
 networks and data mining are used for knowledge discovery. They can 
 discover underlying patterns, categories, and behaviors in large data sets that 
could not be discovered by managers alone or simply through experience. 
Genetic algorithms are used for generating solutions to problems that are too 
large and complex for human beings to analyze on their own. Intelligent agents 
can automate routine tasks to help firms search for and filter information for 
use in electronic commerce, supply chain management, and other activities.
Data mining, which we introduced in Chapter 6, helps organizations capture 
undiscovered knowledge residing in large databases, providing managers with 
new insight for improving business performance. It has become an important 
tool for management decision making, and we provide a detailed discussion of 
data mining for management decision support in Chapter 12.
The other intelligent techniques discussed in this section are based on 
 artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which consists of computer-based 
 systems (both hardware and software) that attempt to emulate human behavior. 
Such systems would be able to learn languages, accomplish physical tasks, use 
a perceptual apparatus, and emulate human expertise and decision making. 
Although AI applications do not exhibit the breadth, complexity, originality, 
and generality of human intelligence, they play an important role in contempo-
rary knowledge management.
CAPTURING KNOWLEDGE: EXPERT SYSTEMS
Expert systems are an intelligent technique for capturing tacit knowledge in 
a very specific and limited domain of human expertise. These systems capture 
the knowledge of skilled employees in the form of a set of rules in a software 
system that can be used by others in the organization. The set of rules in the 
expert system adds to the memory, or stored learning, of the firm.
Expert systems lack the breadth of knowledge and the understanding of fun-
damental principles of a human expert. They typically perform very limited 
tasks that can be performed by professionals in a few minutes or hours, such as 
 diagnosing a malfunctioning machine or determining whether to grant credit 
for a loan. Problems that cannot be solved by human experts in the same short 
period of time are far too difficult for an expert system. However, by capturing 
human expertise in limited areas, expert systems can provide benefits, helping 
organizations make high-quality decisions with fewer people. Today, expert sys-
tems are widely used in business in discrete, highly structured decision-making 
situations.

How Expert Systems Work
Human knowledge must be modeled or represented in a way that a computer 
can process. Expert systems model human knowledge as a set of rules that 
 collectively are called the knowledge base. The rules are obtained by  carefully 
interviewing one or several “experts” who have a thorough command of the 
knowledge base for the system or by documenting business rules found in 
manuals, books, or reports. Expert systems have from 200 to many thousands 
of these rules, depending on the complexity of the problem. These rules are 
much more interconnected and nested than in a traditional software program 
(see Figure 11.5).
The strategy used to search through the knowledge base is called the 
 inference engine. Two strategies are commonly used: forward chaining and 
backward chaining (see Figure 11.6).
In forward chaining, the inference engine begins with the informa-
tion entered by the user and searches the rule base to arrive at a conclusion.
The strategy is to fire, or carry out, the action of the rule when a condition is 
true. In Figure 11.6, beginning on the left, if the user enters a client’s name with 
income greater than $100,000, the engine will fire all rules in sequence from 
left to right. If the user then enters information indicating that the same client 
 FIGURE 11.5 RULES IN AN EXPERT SYSTEM
An expert system contains a number of rules to be followed. The rules are interconnected; the number of outcomes is known in 
advance and is limited; there are multiple paths to the same outcome; and the system can consider multiple rules at a single time. 
The rules illustrated are for simple credit-granting expert systems.
476 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

owns real estate, another pass of the rule base will occur and more rules will 
fire. Processing continues until no more rules can be fired.
In backward chaining, the strategy for searching the rule base starts with a 
hypothesis and proceeds by asking the user questions about selected facts until 
the hypothesis is either confirmed or disproved. In our example, in Figure 11.6, 
ask the question, “Should we add this person to the prospect database?” Begin on 
the right of the diagram and work toward the left. You can see that the person 
should be added to the database if a sales representative is sent, term insurance is 
granted, or a financial adviser visits the client.
Examples of Successful Expert Systems
Expert systems provide businesses with an array of benefits including improved 
decisions, reduced errors, reduced costs, reduced training time, and higher 
levels of quality and service. Con-Way Transportation built an expert system 
called Line-haul to automate and optimize planning of overnight  shipment 
routes for its nationwide freight-trucking business. The expert system  captures 
the business rules that dispatchers follow when assigning drivers, trucks, 
and trailers to transport 50,000 shipments of heavy freight each night across 
25 states and Canada and then plots their routes. Line-haul runs on a Sun 
 computer platform and uses data on daily customer shipment requests, avail-
able drivers, trucks, trailer space, and weight stored in an Oracle database. 
The expert system uses thousands of rules and 100,000 lines of  program code 
 written in C++ to crunch the numbers and create optimum routing plans for 
95 percent of daily freight shipments. Con-Way dispatchers tweak the routing 
plan provided by the expert system and relay final routing specifications to 
field personnel responsible for packing the trailers for their nighttime runs. 
Con-Way recouped its $3 million investment in the system within two years by 
reducing the number of drivers, packing more freight per trailer, and  reducing 
damage from rehandling. The system also reduces dispatchers’ arduous nightly 
tasks.
 FIGURE 11.6 INFERENCE ENGINES IN EXPERT SYSTEMS
An inference engine works by searching through the rules and “firing” those rules that are triggered by facts gathered and entered 
by the user. Basically, a collection of rules is similar to a series of nested IF statements in a traditional software program; however, 
the magnitude of the statements and degree of nesting are much greater in an expert system.
 
Chapter 11 Managing Knowledge 
477

Although expert systems lack the robust and general intelligence of human 
beings, they can provide benefits to organizations if their limitations are well 
understood. Only certain classes of problems can be solved using expert 
 systems. Virtually all successful expert systems deal with problems of classifi-
cation in limited domains of knowledge where there are relatively few alterna-
tive outcomes and these possible outcomes are all known in advance. Expert 
systems are much less useful for dealing with unstructured problems typically 
encountered by managers.
Many expert systems require large, lengthy, and expensive development 
efforts. Hiring or training more experts may be less expensive than building an 
expert system. Typically, the environment in which an expert system operates 
is continually changing so that the expert system must also continually change. 
Some expert systems, especially large ones, are so complex that in a few years 
the maintenance costs equal the development costs.
ORGANIZATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: CASE-BASED 
REASONING
Expert systems primarily capture the tacit knowledge of individual experts, but 
organizations also have collective knowledge and expertise that they have built 
up over the years. This organizational knowledge can be captured and stored 
using case-based reasoning. In case-based reasoning (CBR), descriptions of 
past experiences of human specialists, represented as cases, are documented 
and stored in a database for later retrieval when the user encounters a new case 
with similar parameters. The system searches for stored cases with problem 
characteristics similar to the new one, finds the closest fit, and applies the solu-
tions of the old case to the new case. Successful solutions are tagged to the new 
case and both are stored together with the other cases in the knowledge base. 
Unsuccessful solutions also are appended to the case database along with expla-
nations as to why the solutions did not work (see Figure 11.7).
Expert systems work by applying a set of IF-THEN-ELSE rules extracted from 
human experts. Case-based reasoning, in contrast, represents knowledge as a 
series of cases, and this knowledge base is continuously expanded and refined 
by users. You’ll find case-based reasoning in diagnostic systems in medicine or 
customer support where users can retrieve past cases whose characteristics are 
similar to the new case. The system suggests a solution or diagnosis based on 
the best-matching retrieved case.
FUZZY LOGIC SYSTEMS
Most people do not think in terms of traditional IF-THEN rules or precise num-
bers. Humans tend to categorize things imprecisely using rules for making 
decisions that may have many shades of meaning. For example, a man or a 
woman can be strong or intelligent. A company can be large, medium, or small in 
size. Temperature can be hot, cold, cool, or warm. These categories represent a 
range of values.
Fuzzy logic is a rule-based technology that can represent such imprecision 
by creating rules that use approximate or subjective values. It can describe 
a particular phenomenon or process linguistically and then represent that 
description in a small number of flexible rules. Organizations can use fuzzy 
logic to create software systems that capture tacit knowledge where there is 
linguistic ambiguity.
478 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

Let’s look at the way fuzzy logic would represent various tempera-
tures in a computer application to control room temperature automatically.
The terms (known as membership functions) are imprecisely defined so 
that, for example, in Figure 11.8, cool is between 45 degrees and 70 degrees, 
although the temperature is most clearly cool between about 60 degrees 
and 67 degrees. Note that cool is overlapped by cold or norm. To control the 
room environment using this logic, the programmer would develop similarly 
imprecise definitions for humidity and other factors, such as outdoor wind 
and temperature. The rules might include one that says: “If the tempera-
ture is cool or cold and the humidity is low while the outdoor wind is high 
and the outdoor temperature is low, raise the heat and humidity in the room.”
The computer would combine the membership function readings in a weighted 
manner and, using all the rules, raise and lower the temperature and humidity.
Fuzzy logic provides solutions to problems requiring expertise that is diffi-
cult to represent in the form of crisp IF-THEN rules. In Japan, Sendai’s subway 
system uses fuzzy logic controls to accelerate so smoothly that standing pas-
sengers need not hold on. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Tokyo has been able 
to reduce the power consumption of its air conditioners by 20 percent by imple-
menting control programs in fuzzy logic. The autofocus device in cameras 
is only possible because of fuzzy logic. In these instances, fuzzy logic allows

Case-based reasoning represents knowledge as a database of past cases and their solutions.
The system uses a six-step process to generate solutions to new problems encountered by the user.

incremental changes in inputs to produce smooth changes in outputs instead of 
discontinuous ones, making it useful for consumer electronics and engineering 
applications.
Management also has found fuzzy logic useful for decision making and 
 organizational control. A Wall Street firm created a system that selects 
 companies for potential acquisition, using the language stock traders under-
stand. A fuzzy logic system has been developed to detect possible fraud in med-
ical claims submitted by health care providers anywhere in the United States.
MACHINE LEARNING
Machine learning is the study of how computer programs can improve their 
performance without explicit programming. Why does this constitute learning? 
A machine that learns is a machine that, like a human being, can recognize 
 patterns in data, and change its behavior based on its recognition of patterns, 
experience, or prior learnings (a database). For instance, a car-driving robot 
should be able to recognize the presence of other cars and objects (people), 
and change its behavior accordingly (stop, go, slow down, speed up, or turn). 
The idea of a self-taught, self-correcting, computer program is not new, and has 
been a part of the artificial intelligence field at least since the 1970s. Up until 
the 1990s, however, machine learning was not very capable of producing useful 
devices or solving interesting, business problems. 
Machine learning has expanded greatly in the last ten years because of the 
growth in computing power available to scientists and firms and its falling cost, 
along with advances in the design of algorithms, databases, and robots (see 
the chapter-ending case on IBM’s Watson). The Internet and the big data (see 
Chapter 6) made available on the Internet have proved to be very useful testing 
and proving grounds for machine learning. 
We use machine learning every day but don’t recognize it. Every Google 
search is resolved using algorithms that rank the billions of Web pages based 
on your query, and change the results based on any changes you make in your 
 FIGURE 11.8 FUZZY LOGIC FOR TEMPERATURE CONTROL
The membership functions for the input called temperature are in the logic of the thermostat to control the room temperature. Membership 
functions help translate linguistic expressions such as warm into numbers that the computer can manipulate.
480 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

search, all in a few milliseconds. Search results also vary according to your 
prior searches and the items you clicked on. Every time you buy something 
on Amazon, its recommender engine will suggest other items you might be 
 interested in based on patterns in your prior consumption, behavior on other 
Web sites, and the purchases of others who are “similar” to you. Every time you 
visit Netflix, a recommender system will come up with movies you might be 
interested in based on a similar set of factors. 
Neural Networks
Neural networks are used for solving complex, poorly understood problems 
for which large amounts of data have been collected. They find patterns and 
relationships in massive amounts of data that would be too complicated and 
 difficult for a human being to analyze. Neural networks discover this knowl-
edge by using hardware and software that parallel the processing patterns of 
the  biological or human brain. Neural networks “learn” patterns from large 
quantities of data by sifting through data, searching for relationships, building 
models, and correcting over and over again the model’s own mistakes.
A neural network has a large number of sensing and processing nodes 
that continuously interact with each other. Figure 11.9 represents one type 
of neural network comprising an input layer, an output layer, and a hidden 
processing layer. Humans “train” the network by feeding it a set of  training 
data for which the inputs produce a known set of outputs or conclusions. This 
helps the computer learn the correct solution by example. As the  computer is 
fed more data, each case is compared with the known outcome. If it differs, 
a correction is calculated and applied to the nodes in the hidden processing 
layer. These steps are repeated until a condition, such as corrections being 
less than a certain amount, is reached. The neural network in Figure 11.9 has 
learned how to  identify a fraudulent credit card purchase. Also, self-organiz-
ing neural  networks can be trained by exposing them to large amounts of data 
and  allowing them to  discover the patterns and  relationships in the data.
A Google research team headed by Stanford University computer  scientist 
Andrew Y. Ng and Google fellow Jeff Dean recently created a neural network 
 FIGURE 11.9 HOW A NEURAL NETWORK WORKS
A neural network uses rules it “learns” from patterns in data to construct a hidden layer of logic.
The hidden layer then processes inputs, classifying them based on the experience of the model.
In this example, the neural network has been trained to distinguish between valid and fraudulent 
credit card purchases.

with more than one billion connections that could identify cats. The  network 
used an array of 16,000 processors and was fed random thumbnails of images, 
each extracted from a collection of 10 million YouTube videos. The neural 
 network taught itself to recognize cats, without human help in identify-
ing  specific features during the learning process. Google believes this neural 
 network has promising applications in image search, speech recognition, and 
machine language translation (Markoff, 2013). IBM has developed an energy-
efficient processor chip that relies on a dense web of transistors similar to the 
brain’s neural network. It is still in experimental mode, with great promise for 
pattern recognition (Markoff, 2014). The Interactive Session on Organizations 
describes neural network applications for facial recognition and their potential 
impact on individual privacy.
Whereas expert systems seek to emulate or model a human expert’s way 
of solving problems, neural network builders claim that they do not program 
solutions and do not aim to solve specific problems. Instead, neural network 
designers seek to put intelligence into the hardware in the form of a generalized 
capability to learn. In contrast, the expert system is highly specific to a given 
problem and cannot be retrained easily.
Neural network applications in medicine, science, and business address 
problems in pattern classification, prediction, financial analysis, and control 
and optimization. In medicine, neural network applications are used for screen-
ing patients for coronary artery disease, for diagnosing patients with epilepsy 
and Alzheimer’s disease, and for performing pattern recognition of pathology 
images. The financial industry uses neural networks to discern patterns in 
vast pools of data that might help predict the performance of equities, corpo-
rate bond ratings, or corporate bankruptcies. Visa International uses a neural 
 network to help detect credit card fraud by monitoring all Visa transactions for 
sudden changes in the buying patterns of cardholders.
There are many puzzling aspects of neural networks. Unlike expert  systems, 
which typically provide explanations for their solutions, neural networks 
cannot always explain why they arrived at a particular solution. Moreover, they 
cannot always guarantee a completely certain solution, arrive at the same solu-
tion again with the same input data, or always guarantee the best solution. 
They are very sensitive and may not perform well if their  training covers too 
little or too much data. In most current applications, neural networks are best 
used as aids to human decision makers instead of substitutes for them.
Genetic Algorithms
Genetic algorithms are useful for finding the optimal solution for a  specific 
problem by examining a very large number of possible solutions for that 
 problem. They are based on techniques inspired by evolutionary biology, such 
as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover (recombination).
A genetic algorithm works by representing information as a string of 0s 
and 1s. The genetic algorithm searches a population of randomly generated 
strings of binary digits to identify the right string representing the best pos-
sible  solution for the problem. As solutions alter and combine, the worst ones 
are discarded and the better ones survive to go on to produce even better 
solutions.
In Figure 11.10, each string corresponds to one of the variables in the 
 problem. One applies a test for fitness, ranking the strings in the population 
according to their level of desirability as possible solutions. After the initial 
population is evaluated for fitness, the algorithm then produces the next gener-
ation of strings, consisting of strings that survived the fitness test plus offspring

New York City wants very much to be a “smart city.” 
In the fall of 2013, New York University, with support 
from city government, opened the Center for Urban 
Science and Progress under the direction of Steven E. 
Koonin, a former Obama administration undersecre-
tary for science in the Department of Energy. Koonin 
foresees work on a broad range of quality of life and 
urban efficiency projects ranging from traffic man-
agement to reducing water and electricity consump-
tion by 30 to 50 percent in ten years’ time.
The first target for a ten-member team of gradu-
ate students, music professors, and computer scien-
tists is noise pollution. Starting with data from 311 
(the non-emergency line for citizen complaints on 
a range of issues including noise disturbances), the 
researchers will gather additional data from wireless 
sensors on windows and buildings and noise meters 
on traffic lights and street corners. A smartphone 
app may also be employed in a crowd-sourcing effort 
to encourage citizen participation and gather even 
more comprehensive statistics. One possible out-
come foreseen by Koonin is a noise limit ordinance 
for vehicles. Using a combination of incentives and 
violation fees, citizens will be persuaded to replace 
or repair malfunctioning mufflers. Computer simu-
lations will inform decision-makers about the opti-
mum combination of enforcement mechanisms and 
sequence of steps to maximize compliance. 
Zoning, building classification, and traffic flow 
data along with Department of Sanitation routes 
and pickup times will be used to optimize  garbage 
 collection. The goal will be to service as many 
 commercial districts as possible in the middle of the 
night when traffic is lightest and the fewest  residents 
will be  disturbed. Next up is a plan to assemble 
 thermal images of buildings across the city that will 
serve as the basis for energy use studies. 
A terabyte of information (equivalent to 143 
 million printed pages) flows daily to New York’s 
Office of Policy and Strategic Initiatives from every 
corner of the city, from death certificates to minutiae 
such as the type of boilers and sprinklers installed in 
the city’s 900,000 buildings. The Office was tasked 
with reducing the number of illegal conversions—
the  creation of additional dwelling units in build-
ings that lack legally required infrastructure such as 
adequate means of egress and electrical wiring. The 
team  combined data from 19 agencies and created 
a model to optimize building inspections. Building 
age, repair  permits, foreclosure notices, late tax pay-
ments, and other  similar data fed a program that 
fueled an increase from 13 percent to 70 percent of 
building inspections identifying a hazardous dwell-
ing. Previously, the city’s 200 building inspectors 
had futilely attempted to respond to the more than 
20,000 annual complaints based solely on sketchy 
grievance descriptions.
Michael Flowers is the Analytics Director for 
the Office. When the Department of Environmental 
Protection wanted to improve its efficiency in locat-
ing restaurants that illegally dump cooking oil into 
sewers—the primary cause of clogged city pipes—it 
turned to Flowers’s team. Using the restaurant loca-
tion, geospatial sewer location, and certificates on 
file with the Business Integrity Commission, a data 
 sifting  program easily pinpointed restaurants that 
had not contracted with a grease-hauling service 
and their nearest storm drain. Health department 
inspectors sent to these locations registered a stun-
ning 95% success rate in catching culprits. 
Participants in a Big Apps competition, begun 
in 2009, use the more than 1,000 data sets now 
 publicly available on the NYC Open Data Portal as 
their  primary resource. In the 2013 Best Jobs and 
Economic Mobility category, the ChildCareDesk app 
garnered first place. Maps, Yelp reviews, and detailed 
reports from various city accreditation agencies 
assist  parental decision-making, and an alert system 
notifies them when a vacancy has arisen. Other win-
ning apps in  previous years provide the locations of 
public restrooms and the safest routes for bicyclists.
Flowers sees even more data that can be mined—
the hundreds of thousands of daily posts to Twitter, 
Facebook and other social media sites. Complaints 
that do not make it to city agencies concerning unhy-
gienic restaurants, uncollected garbage, and unsafe 
streets can be gleaned from these sources to further 
the cause of enhancing a New Yorker’s quality of life.
This may be a bridge too far for privacy advo-
cates who have been watching the Big Data/Smart 
City movement with a wary eye. While recognizing 
the Smart Cities potential for improving services 
and helping citizens, groups such as the New York 
Civil Liberties Union worry about possible abuses. 
Safeguards, including removing names and tax iden-
tification numbers and installing employee key-
stroke logs, have proven vulnerable to reverse iden-
tification and tampering. Undoubtedly, the release

of public data, even absent any surveillance intent, 
must include safeguards. 
Ford is working on safety systems that will 
inform drivers of both internal (V2I: vehicle-to-infra-
structure) and external (V2V: vehicle-to-vehicle) 
threats. The V2V system warns you if a car is speed-
ing up to run a red light, for example. Ford has also 
developed an upgrade for stoplights to create “smart 
intersections” that monitor digital maps, GPS data, 
and traffic signal status and transmit that data to 
onboard computers. Drivers are then both visually 
and aurally alerted to potential hazards.
Intel research scientists foresee smart cities 
with drivers who not only know the velocity of the 
car in front of them, but can simultaneously see 
three cars to the right, left, and behind. What’s 
more, cameras can detect if surrounding drivers are 
looking up, down, or forward, and if one of them 
is balancing a cup along with the steering wheel. 
These “driver states” will feed predictive modeling 
programs to calculate the odds of an accident occur-
ring and which vehicles are best-positioned to avert 
calamity. Decreased collision rates and their atten-
dant injuries and fatalities are no doubt a societal 
good, but many questions arise with this level of 
data-sharing. Will law enforcement have access to 
velocity information that could result in automatic 
speeding tickets? If you turn around to give a paci-
fier to the baby in the car seat, will the increase in 
accident probability garner you an automatic mov-
ing violation? While we might all want the infor-
mation about the careless drivers around us, are we 
willing to share our own driving foibles?

INTELLIGENT AGENTS
Intelligent agent technology helps businesses navigate through large amounts of 
data to locate and act on information that is considered important. Intelligent 
agents are software programs that work without direct human intervention 
to carry out specific tasks for an individual user, business process, or software 
application. The agent uses a built-in or learned knowledge base to accom-
plish tasks or make decisions on the user’s behalf, such as deleting junk e-mail, 
scheduling appointments, or traveling over interconnected networks to find the 
cheapest airfare to California.
There are many intelligent agent applications today in operating systems, 
application software, e-mail systems, mobile computing software, and network 
tools. For example, the wizards found in Microsoft Office software tools have 
built-in capabilities to show users how to accomplish various tasks, such as 
formatting documents or creating graphs, and to anticipate when users need 
assistance. Chapter 10 describes how intelligent agent shopping bots can help 
consumers find products they want and assist them in comparing prices and 
other features. 
Although some intelligent agents are programmed to follow a simple set of 
rules, others are capable of learning from experience and adjusting their behav-
ior. Siri, an application on Apple’s iOS operating system for the iPhone and 
iPad, is an example. Siri is an intelligent personal assistant that uses voice rec-
ognition technology to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform 
actions. The software adapts to the user's individual preferences over time and

This example illustrates an initial population of “chromosomes,” each representing a different solution. The genetic algorithm uses an iterative 
process to refine the initial solutions so that the better ones, those with the higher fitness, are more likely to emerge as the best solution.

personalizes results, performing tasks such as finding nearby restaurants, pur-
chasing movie tickets, getting directions, scheduling appointments, and send-
ing messages. Siri understands natural speech, and it asks the user questions if 
it needs more information to complete a task. Siri does not process speech input 
locally on the users’s device. Instead, it sends commands through a remote 
server, so users have to be connected to Wi-Fi or a 3G signal.
Many complex phenomena can be modeled as systems of autonomous agents 
that follow relatively simple rules for interaction. Agent-based  modeling 
applications have been developed to model the behavior of consumers, stock 
markets, and supply chains and to predict the spread of epidemics.
Procter & Gamble (P&G) used agent-based modeling to improve coordination 
among different members of its supply chain in response to changing business 
conditions (see Figure 11.11). It modeled a complex supply chain as a group of 
semiautonomous “agents” representing individual supply chain components, 
such as trucks, production facilities, distributors, and retail stores. The behavior 
of each agent is programmed to follow rules that mimic actual behavior, such as 
“order an item when it is out of stock.” Simulations using the agents enable the 
company to perform what-if analyses on inventory levels, in-store stockouts, 
and transportation costs.
Using intelligent agent models, P&G discovered that trucks should often 
be dispatched before being fully loaded. Although transportation costs would 
be higher using partially loaded trucks, the simulation showed that retail 
store stockouts would occur less often, thus reducing the amount of lost sales, 
which would more than make up for the higher distribution costs. Agent-based 
 modeling has saved P&G $300 million annually on an investment of less than 
1 percent of that amount.

HYBRID AI SYSTEMS
Genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, neural networks, and expert systems can be inte-
grated into a single application to take advantage of the best features of these 
technologies. Such systems are called hybrid AI systems. Hybrid applications 
in business are growing. In Japan, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Ricoh, Sanyo, and others 
are starting to incorporate hybrid AI in products such as home appliances, factory 
machinery, and office equipment. Matsushita has developed a “neurofuzzy” wash-
ing machine that combines fuzzy logic with neural networks. Nikko Securities 
has been working on a neurofuzzy system to forecast convertible-bond ratings.
Review Summary
1. What is the role of knowledge management systems in business?
Knowledge management is a set of processes to create, store, transfer, and apply knowledge in the 
organization. Much of a firm’s value depends on its ability to create and manage knowledge. Knowledge 
management promotes organizational learning by increasing the ability of the organization to learn 
from its environment and to incorporate knowledge into its business processes. There are three major 
types of knowledge management systems: enterprise-wide knowledge management systems, 
 knowledge work systems, and intelligent techniques.
2. What types of systems are used for enterprise-wide knowledge management and how do they provide 
value for businesses?
Enterprise-wide knowledge management systems are firmwide efforts to collect, store, distribute, 
and apply digital content and knowledge. Enterprise content management systems provide  databases 
and tools for organizing and storing structured documents and tools for organizing and storing 
 semistructured knowledge, such as e-mail or rich media. Knowledge network systems provide 
 directories and tools for locating firm employees with special expertise who are important sources 
of tacit knowledge. Often these systems include group collaboration tools (including wikis and social 
 bookmarking), portals to simplify information access, search tools, and tools for classifying informa-
tion based on a taxonomy that is appropriate for the organization. Enterprise-wide knowledge 
 management systems can provide considerable value if they are well designed and enable employ-
ees to locate, share, and use knowledge more efficiently.
3. What are the major types of knowledge work systems and how do they provide value for firms?
Knowledge work systems (KWS) support the creation of new knowledge and its integration into the 
organization. KWS require easy access to an external knowledge base; powerful computer hardware that 
can support software with intensive graphics, analysis, document management, and communications 
capabilities; and a user-friendly interface. Computer-aided design (CAD) systems, augmented reality 
applications, and virtual reality systems, which create interactive simulations that behave like the real 
world, require graphics and powerful modeling capabilities. KWS for financial professionals provide 
access to external databases and the ability to analyze massive amounts of financial data very quickly.
4. What are the business benefits of using intelligent techniques for knowledge management?
Artificial intelligence lacks the flexibility, breadth, and generality of human intelligence, but it 
can be used to capture, codify, and extend organizational knowledge. Expert systems capture tacit 
knowledge from a limited domain of human expertise and express that knowledge in the form of 
rules. Expert systems are most useful for problems of classification or diagnosis. Case-based reason-
ing represents organizational knowledge as a database of cases that can be continually expanded 
and refined.
Fuzzy logic is a software technology for expressing knowledge in the form of rules that use 
 approximate or subjective values. Fuzzy logic has been used for controlling physical devices and is 
starting to be used for limited decision-making applications.

Machine learning refers to the ability of computer programs to automatically learn and improve with 
 experience. Neural networks consist of hardware and software that attempt to mimic the thought processes 
of the human brain. Neural networks are notable for their ability to learn without programming and to 
 recognize patterns that cannot be easily described by humans. They are being used in science, medicine, and 
business to discriminate patterns in massive amounts of data.
Genetic algorithms develop solutions to particular problems using genetically based processes such as 
 fitness, crossover, and mutation. Genetic algorithms are beginning to be applied to problems involving 
 optimization, product design, and monitoring industrial systems where many alternatives or  variables must 
be evaluated to generate an optimal solution.
Intelligent agents are software programs with built-in or learned knowledge bases that carry out specific 
tasks for an individual user, business process, or software application. Intelligent agents can be programmed 
to navigate through large amounts of data to locate useful information and in some cases act on that informa-
tion on behalf of the user.

Improving Decision Making: Building a Simple Expert System for 
Retirement Planning
Software skills: Spreadsheet formulas and IF function or expert system tool
Business skills: Benefits eligibility determination
11-10 
 Expert systems typically use a large number of rules. This project has been simplified to reduce the 
 number of rules, but it will give you experience working with a series of rules to develop an application.
When employees at your company retire, they are given cash bonuses. These cash bonuses are 
based on the length of employment and the retiree’s age. To receive a bonus, an employee must be at least 
50 years of age and have worked for the company for more than five years. The following table  summarizes 
the criteria for determining bonuses. 
LENGTH OF EMPLOYMENT
BONUS
<5 years
No bonus
5–10 years
20 percent of current annual salary
11–15 years
30 percent of current annual salary
16–20 years
40 percent of current annual salary
20–25 years
50 percent of current annual salary
26 or more years
100 percent of current annual salary
Using the information provided, build a simple expert system. Find a demonstration copy of an 
expert system software tool on the Web that you can download. Alternatively, use your spreadsheet  software

Knowledge Management and Collaboration at Tata Consulting Services
CASE STUDY
T
ata Consultancy Services (TCS) is an 
IT-services, business-solutions and out-
sourcing organization that offers a portfolio 
of IT and IT-enabled services to clients all 
over the globe in horizontal, vertical, and geographi-
cal domains. A part of the Tata Group, India’s largest 
industrial conglomerate, TCS has over 108,000 IT 
consultants in 47 countries. 
The concept of knowledge management (KM) 
was introduced in TCS in 1995 and a dedicated KM 
team called “Corporate GroupWare” was formed 
in 1998. This group launched the KM-pilot in mid-
1999, which was implemented subsequently by a 
team comprising the steering committee, corporate 
GroupWare implanters, branch champions, applica-
tion owners and the infrastructure group.
At that time, KM in TCS covered nearly every 
function, from quality assurance to HR management. 
While its 50 offices in India were linked through 
dedicated communication lines, overseas offices 
were connected through the Net and the Lotus Notes 
Domino Servers. The employees could access the 
knowledge repository that resided on the corpo-
rate and branch servers through the intranet with a 
browser front-end or a Notes client. The knowledge 
repository, also called KBases, contained a wide 
range of information about processes, line of busi-
ness, line of technology, and projects.
Though the formal KM efforts started in TCS in 
the late 1990s, the informal, closely knit communi-
ties of practices (CoPs) had existed at TCS since the 
1980s, when it had around a thousand employees. 
The earliest “group” was based on the migration of 
technologies. Later, teams were formed for main-
frame, Unix, and databases. The groups, consisting 
of one or two experts in their respective fields, began 
formal documentation practices with the mem-
bers writing down the best practices. Recollecting 
the group practices in the initial days, K. Ananth 
Krishnan, a technology consultant at that time, 
recounted that in the mid-1980s, problems and solu-
tions were documented and there were over 1,500 
case studies dealing with mainframes. Similarly, 40 
case studies dealing with overall system quality were 
reviewed as early as 1993.
The next step was to create process asset librar-
ies (PALs), which contained information related to 
technology, processes, and case studies for project 
leaders, which were made available to all develop-
ment centers through the intranet.
Then Ultimatix, a Web-based electronic knowl-
edge management (EKM) portal, which made the 
knowledge globally available, was developed. The 
PAL library and KBases, which were hosted on the 
intranet, were merged with Ultimatix, which had 
sub-portals for a quality management system, soft-
ware productivity improvement, training materials, 
and tools information. There were EKM administra-
tors for each practice and subject group with defined 
responsibilities, such as editing the documents and 
approving them for publication. Commenting on the 
success of CoP, Krishnan maintained that between 
January 2003 and June 2003, CoP members had 
exchanged around 10,000 document transactions 
relating to the industry practices and 21,000 service 
practices via Ultimatix. The telecom CoP alone had 
6,000 transactions, excluding the intranet-based com-
munity activities.
To encourage employee conversations, TCS took 
considerable care in the architecture of its develop-
ment centers located across the country. Reflecting 
on the new design of one of its development centers 
in Sholinganallur, Chennai, CFO S. Mahalingam com-
mented that the center is made up of modules, each 
dedicated to one particular technology or a client or 
an industry practice. These structures lead to garden 
terraces where employees gather during their break 
for informal conversations and to brainstorm the 
solutions to many problems.
TCS also launched a number of training programs 
such as the Initial Learning Program, targeted at 
new employees, the Continuous Learning Program 
for experienced employees, and the Leadership 
Development Program for employees with more 
than five years’ experience. The integrated compe-
tency and learning management systems (iCALMS) 
that was deployed globally across all TCS offices pro-
moted a culture of learning and growth in the organi-
zation. Equipped with data about competency defini-
tions, role definitions, and online/classroom learning 
objectives, it helped the consultants to enhance their 
skills in a customized manner. To gain cross-industry   
experience, TCS regularly rotated people across vari-
ous functions and within other Tata Group compa-
nies. Employees were also encouraged to join outside 
bodies like the IEEE, and to go in for certifications.
 
Chapter 11 Managing Knowledge

Knowmax, a knowledge management system, 
developed using Microsoft sharepoint portal server in 
2007, gave TCS consultants access to nearly 40 years 
of experience and best practices, arranged by type 
of engagement, the technology in use, and customer 
requirements. It supported more than 60 knowledge 
assets and was accessible via Ultimatix to all TCS 
associates. Any associate could contribute to the 
K-Bank and knowledge officers were made respon-
sible for maintaining the quality of content. 
To maintain the work–life balance of its employ-
ees, TCS initiated Propel sessions, which brought 
together employees with similar interests to conduct 
various activities such as reading books. Later, held 
every quarter through conferences and camps, this 
initiative also spurred knowledge transfer among the 
employees. The knowledge sharing at the project 
level was done through the LiveMeeting applica-
tion, where all the project meetings were recorded 
and stored in the project repository. Team members 
who missed the meeting or any new members in the 
team could listen to the recorded sessions, and this 
enabled them to catch up with the rest of the team. 
Furthermore, Knowledge Transition sessions con-
ducted weekly by a subject matter expert helped the 
team to learn from the experience of the experts. A 
“Tip of the Day” mail, comprising either technical, 
or conceptual, or human skills tips was also shared 
within the organization almost daily.
Though Ultimatix, launched in 2002, digitized the 
entire organization from end to end and improved 
the business processes’ efficiency, it still couldn’t tap 
the knowledge of employees effectively. To improve 
collaboration among employees, Project Infinity was 
launched in 2007; this involved a number of technol-
ogies including IBM’s Sametime, QuickPlace, Lotus 
Domino Collaboration tools, Avaya VOIP telephony, 
and Polycom IP videoconferencing.
As a result of adopting Infinity, collaboration 
of overseas and local offices improved as instant 
messaging (IM) got rid of cultural and pronun-
ciation differences that could occur on the phone. 
Furthermore, corporate communications were 
able to run a 24-hour internal news broadcast to 
all TCS offices in the world. In addition, travel and 
telecommunications costs were reduced by 40 per-
cent and 6 percent respectively.
Other than these channels, the company also 
used the JustAsk system (embedded into the KM), 
Blog platform, IdeaStorm, TIP, and My Site. Blogging 
has caught on rapidly since 2006 when it was first 
introduced. Almost 40,000–50,000 TCS staff blogged 
on the intranet. While the JustAsk system allowed 
employees to post questions that others could 
answer, Idea Storm was a once-a-year event where 
two to three topics were posted by the corporate 
team on which ideas were invited by everyone. TIP, 
an open portal for product innovation and potential 
new ideas was launched to promote the sharing of 
ideas. MySite, embedded into the KM portal, allowed 
each associate to have a personal page like Facebook 
or Orkut.
In 2014, TCS remained India’s largest software 
exporter, and became the first company to surpass 
$90 billion in market capitalization. TCS used eco-
nomic downturns in the late 2000s to become even 
more efficient, and has since continued to add 
more staff as economic conditions improved. CEO 
Natarajan Chandrasekaran continues to emphasize 
collaboration among members of individual business 
units as well as across the whole of TCS. In 2015, TCS 
continued to report solid financial figures, includ-
ing strong gains in operating profit, recording a 3.9 
percent increase over the previous year. Although 
the company’s overall profits remained steady at 
approximately $3.93 billion, analysts suggest that 
the company is still positioned well going into 2015. 
Although many divisions of TCS are seasonal, the 
company as a whole has diversified to such a degree 
that they can avoid excessive swings from quarter to 
quarter. The future for TCS continues to look bright 
going forward.

n a stunning display of talent, resilience, and teamwork, Germany won 
the 2014 World Cup, defeating Argentina 1–0. Argentina had Lionel 
Messi, the 2014 World Cup’s best player. Brazil, whom the Germans 
defeated 7–1 in the  semi-finals, was considered the overwhelming 
 favorite. Exactly how did Germany pull this off?
The German team sparkled with individual talent in every position, and was 
praised for playing brilliantly as a team. But the winners had another 
 behind-the-scenes advantage: Big data was at their side. The German team was 
able to use information technology to analyze massive amounts of data about 
teams’ performance and then use what it had learned to improve how it played. 
Each of the 32 competing 2014 World Cup teams had a dedicated video and 
 performance analyst, but Germany appears to have been the only one that 
employed a special database and software to measure and analyze  individual 
and team performance and strategies.
In 2012, the German Football Association partnered with German  software 
giant SAP AG to create a custom match analysis tool called Match Insights 
that collects and analyzes massive amounts of player performance data. 
Match Insights analyzes video data from on-field cameras that capture 
 thousands of data points per second, including player speed and position. 
These data are organized and stored in an SAP database. Match Insights uses 
SAP HANA in-memory computing and analytic software to analyze vast 
quantities of data in real time (see Chapter 6). Match Insights allows coaches 
to target performance metrics for specific players and give them feedback 
via their mobile devices.
GERMANY WINS THE WORLD CUP WITH 
BIG DATA AT ITS SIDE

About 50 students at Deutsche Sporthochschule Köln (a sports university in 
Cologne) started compiling data about the teams and players that would be 
competing for the next World Cup, including every play they had run, and 
input the data into the Match Insights database. These data included video 
from eight on-field cameras that surround the area where the match is played, 
which the database views as a grid. The system assigns each German and 
opposing soccer player a unique identifier, so that their movements can be 
tracked digitally. Match Insights analyzes these data to measure key perfor-
mance indicators, such as possession time (the percentage of time a team has 
the ball in a match), the number of touches controlling the ball, and move-
ment speeds.
Improving speed was a major objective for the German team in 2014. Match 
Insights enabled the team to analyze statistics about average possession time 
and reduce it from 3.4 seconds to about 1.1 seconds. Better possession time 
enabled the German team to improve on their aggressive, fast-paced style of 
playing that brought them to World Cup victory. 
Match Insights can show the team virtual “defensive shadows” that indicate 
how much area a player can protect with his own body. This information helps 
the team visualize and exploit weak links in an opponent’s setup.
The German team also used Match Insights to evaluate the performance of 
its competitors. For example, the Germans were able to see before playing 
against the French that this team was very concentrated in the middle but left 
spaces on the flanks because their full-backs did not push up properly. The 
German team also reviewed extensive data about how Brazil’s players reacted 
in pressure situations, their preferred routes, and how they responded when 
fouled.
Match Insights was able to make its vast trove of performance data available 
to team members’ mobile phones or tablets. With help from SAP, the team 
developed a mobile app that sends short clips of analysis to individual players 
or groups of players. Right after a game, every player receives several visual 
examples of him doing things well and poorly and may also receive visual data 
about the opposition. Players can also view their performance data in the 
 players’ lounge.
Some commentators have described Match Insights as Germany’s 12th 
man.SAP plans to offering Match Insights to other clubs and soccer federa-
tions.

occer is one of a growing number of sports being transformed by big 
data.Others include baseball (think Moneyball), basketball, and tennis. 
Data analytics are just starting to be used in soccer, and the German team 
appears to have been in the forefront for the 2014 World Cup soccer competi-
tion. The chapter-opening case shows how advanced analytics helped this 
team come out on top by  providing very detailed information about individual 
player and team  performance that could help the team make better decisions 
about how to improve its game. The opening case has important lessons for 
other organizations and  businesses as well: You can be more efficient and 
competitive if, like the German World Cup team, you know how to use data to 
drive your decisions.

12.1 WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DECISIONS 
AND HOW DOES THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS 
WORK? HOW DO INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF MANAGERS AND 
MANAGEMENT DECISION MAKING? 
D
ecision making in businesses used to be limited to management. 
Today,  lower-level employees are responsible for some of these 
 decisions, as information systems make information available to 
lower levels of the business. But what do we mean by better decision 
making? How does decision making take place in businesses and other 
 organizations? Let’s take a closer look.
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised 
by this case and this chapter. World Cup Soccer is one of the globe’s most 
 competitive and highly-charged sports, and the German team was not favored 
to win the 2014 competition. However, it appears to be the first World Cup team 
to take advantage of new opportunities from information technology, includ-
ing tools for capturing, storing, and analyzing big data regarding player and 
team performance. Other teams were hamstrung by earlier models of decision 
making that didn’t take advantage of available technology. The German World 
Cup team collected vast quantities of detailed statistical and visual data and 
was able to devise a better set of metrics for analyzing player and team perfor-
mance. Match Insights helped World Cup managers, coaches, and players make 
more precise, fine-grained decisions on how to best play the game.
Here are some questions to think about: How did using Match Insights 
change the way the German World Cup team made decisions? Give examples of 
two decisions that were improved by using Match Insights. What can businesses 
learn from the German 2014 World Cup victory?
 
Chapter 12 Enhancing Decision Making

BUSINESS VALUE OF IMPROVED DECISION MAKING
What does it mean to the business to make better decisions? What is the 
 monetary value of improved decision making? Table 12.1 attempts to  measure 
the monetary value of improved decision making for a small U.S. manufactur-
ing firm with $280 million in annual revenue and 140 employees. The firm has 
identified a number of key decisions where new system investments might 
improve the quality of decision making. The table provides selected  estimates of 
annual value (in the form of cost savings or increased revenue) from improved 
 decision making in selected areas of the business.
We can see from Table 12.1 that decisions are made at all levels of the 
firm and that some of these decisions are common, routine, and numerous. 
Although the value of improving any single decision may be small, improving 
hundreds of thousands of “small” decisions adds up to a large annual value for 
the business. 
TYPES OF DECISIONS
Chapters 1 and 2 showed that there are different levels in an organization. Each 
of these levels has different information requirements for decision support and 
responsibility for different types of decisions (see Figure 12.1). Decisions are 
classified as structured, semistructured, and unstructured.
Unstructured decisions are those in which the decision maker must 
 provide judgment, evaluation, and insight to solve the problem. Each of these 
decisions is novel, important, and nonroutine, and there is no well-understood 
or agreed-on procedure for making them. 
Structured decisions, by contrast, are repetitive and routine, and they 
involve a definite procedure for handling them so that they do not have to be 
treated each time as if they were new. Many decisions have elements of both 
types of decisions and are semistructured, where only part of the problem has 
a clear-cut answer provided by an accepted procedure. In general, structured 
decisions are more prevalent at lower organizational levels, whereas unstruc-
tured problems are more common at higher levels of the firm.

500 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

Senior executives face many unstructured decision situations, such as 
 establishing the firm’s 5- or 10-year goals or deciding new markets to enter. 
Answering the question “Should we enter a new market?” would require access 
to news, government reports, and industry views as well as high-level  summaries 
of firm performance. However, the answer would also require senior managers 
to use their own best judgment and poll other managers for their opinions. 
Middle management faces more structured decision scenarios but their 
 decisions may include unstructured components. A typical middle-level 
 management decision might be “Why is the reported order fulfillment 
report showing a decline over the past six months at a distribution center 
in Minneapolis?” This middle manager will obtain a report from the firm’s 
 enterprise system or distribution management system on order activity and 
operational efficiency at the Minneapolis distribution center. This is the 
 structured part of the decision. But before arriving at an answer, this middle 
manager will have to interview employees and gather more unstructured infor-
mation from external sources about local economic conditions or sales trends. 
Operational management and rank-and-file employees tend to make more 
structured decisions. For example, a supervisor on an assembly line has 
to decide whether an hourly paid worker is entitled to overtime pay. If the 
employee worked more than eight hours on a particular day, the supervisor 
would routinely grant overtime pay for any time beyond eight hours that was 
clocked on that day. 
A sales account representative often has to make decisions about extending 
credit to customers by consulting the firm’s customer database that  contains 
credit information. If the customer met the firm’s prespecified criteria for 
 granting credit, the account representative would grant that customer credit to 
make a purchase. In both instances, the decisions are highly structured and are

routinely made thousands of times each day in most large firms. The answer has 
been preprogrammed into the firm’s payroll and accounts  receivable systems. 
THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
Making a decision is a multistep process. Simon (1960) described four  different 
stages in decision making: intelligence, design, choice, and implementation 
(see Figure 12.2).
Intelligence consists of discovering, identifying, and understanding the 
problems occurring in the organization—why a problem exists, where, and 
what effects it is having on the firm. 
Design involves identifying and exploring various solutions to the problem. 
Choice consists of choosing among solution alternatives. 
Implementation involves making the chosen alternative work and 
 continuing to monitor how well the solution is working. 
What happens if the solution you have chosen doesn’t work? Figure 12.2 
shows that you can return to an earlier stage in the decision-making process 
and repeat it if necessary. For instance, in the face of declining sales, a sales 
management team may decide to pay the sales force a higher commission for 
making more sales to spur on the sales effort. If this does not produce sales 
increases, managers would need to investigate whether the problem stems from 
 FIGURE 12.2  STAGES IN DECISION MAKING
The decision-making process is broken down into four stages.
502 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

poor product design, inadequate customer support, or a host of other causes 
that call for a different solution. 
MANAGERS AND DECISION MAKING IN THE REAL 
WORLD
The premise of this book and this chapter is that systems to support decision 
making produce better decision making by managers and employees, above 
average returns on investment for the firm, and ultimately higher profitabil-
ity. However, information systems cannot improve all the different kinds of 
 decisions taking place in an organization. Let’s examine the role of managers 
and decision making in organizations to see why this is so. 
Managerial Roles
Managers play key roles in organizations. Their responsibilities range from 
making decisions, to writing reports, to attending meetings, to arranging 
 birthday parties. We are able to better understand managerial functions and 
roles by examining classical and contemporary models of managerial behavior.
The classical model of management, which describes what managers do, 
was largely unquestioned for the more than 70 years since the 1920s. Henri 
Fayol and other early writers first described the five classical functions of 
 managers as planning, organizing, coordinating, deciding, and controlling. This 
description of management activities dominated management thought for a 
long time, and it is still popular today.
The classical model describes formal managerial functions but does not 
address exactly what managers do when they plan, decide things, and  control 
the work of others. For this, we must turn to the work of contemporary 
 behavioral scientists who have studied managers in daily action. Behavioral 
models state that the actual behavior of managers appears to be less  systematic, 
more  informal, less reflective, more reactive, and less well organized than the 
classical model would have us believe. 
Observers find that managerial behavior actually has five attributes that 
 differ greatly from the classical description. First, managers perform a great 
deal of work at an unrelenting pace—studies have found that managers engage 
in more than 600 different activities each day, with no break in their pace. 
Second,  managerial activities are fragmented; most activities last for less than 
nine  minutes, and only 10 percent of the activities exceed one hour in  duration. 
Third, managers prefer current, specific, and ad hoc information (printed 
 information often will be too old). Fourth, they prefer oral forms of communi-
cation to written forms because oral media provide greater flexibility, require 
less effort, and bring a faster response. Fifth, managers give high priority to 
maintaining a diverse and complex web of contacts that act as an informal 
information system and helps them execute their personal agendas and short- 
and long-term goals.
Analyzing managers’ day-to-day behavior, Henry Mintzberg found that it 
could be classified into 10 managerial roles. Managerial roles are expectations 
of the activities that managers should perform in an organization. Mintzberg 
found that these managerial roles fell into three categories: interpersonal, 
 informational, and decisional.
Interpersonal Roles. Managers act as figureheads for the organization when 
they represent their companies to the outside world and perform symbolic 
duties, such as giving out employee awards, in their interpersonal role. 
 
Chapter 12 Enhancing Decision Making 
503

Managers act as leaders, attempting to motivate, counsel, and support subordi-
nates. Managers also act as liaisons between various organizational levels; 
within each of these levels, they serve as liaisons among the members of the 
management team. Managers provide time and favors, which they expect to be 
returned.
Informational Roles. In their informational role, managers act as the 
nerve centers of their organizations, receiving the most concrete, up-to-date 
information and redistributing it to those who need to be aware of it. Managers 
are therefore information disseminators and spokespersons for their organiza-
tions.
Decisional Roles. Managers make decisions. In their decisional role, they 
act as entrepreneurs by initiating new kinds of activities; they handle 
 disturbances arising in the organization; they allocate resources to staff 
 members who need them; and they negotiate conflicts and mediate between 
conflicting groups.
Table 12.2, based on Mintzberg’s role classifications, is one look at where 
 systems can and cannot help managers. The table shows that information sys-
tems are now capable of supporting most, but not all, areas of managerial life. 
Real-World Decision Making
We now see that information systems are not helpful for all managerial roles. 
And in those managerial roles where information systems might improve 
 decisions, investments in information technology do not always produce 
 positive results. There are three main reasons: information quality, manage-
ment filters, and organizational culture (see Chapter 3).
Information Quality. High-quality decisions require high-quality informa-
tion. Table 12.3 describes information quality dimensions that affect the quality 
of decisions.

504 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

If the output of information systems does not meet these quality criteria, 
decision making will suffer. Chapter 6 has shown that corporate databases and 
files have varying levels of inaccuracy and incompleteness, which in turn will 
degrade the quality of decision making. 
Management Filters. Even with timely, accurate information, some manag-
ers make bad decisions. Managers (like all human beings) absorb information 
through a series of filters to make sense of the world around them. Managers 
have selective attention, focus on certain kinds of problems and solutions, and 
have a variety of biases that reject information that does not conform to their 
prior conceptions. 
For instance, Wall Street firms such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers 
imploded in 2008 because they underestimated the risk of their investments 
in complex mortgage securities, many of which were based on subprime loans 
that were more likely to default. The computer models they and other financial 
institutions used to manage risk were based on overly optimistic assumptions 
and overly simplistic data about what might go wrong. Management wanted 
to make sure that their firms’ capital was not all tied up as a cushion against 
defaults from risky investments, preventing them from investing it to generate 
profits. So the designers of these risk management systems were encouraged 
to measure risks in a way that minimzed their importance. Some trading desks 
also oversimplified the information maintained about the mortgage securities 
to make them appear as simple bonds with higher ratings than were warranted 
by their underlying components. 
Organizational Inertia and Politics. Organizations are bureaucracies with 
 limited capabilities and competencies for acting decisively. When  environments 
change and businesses need to adopt new business models to survive, strong 
forces within organizations resist making decisions calling for major change. 
Decisions taken by a firm often represent a balancing of the firm’s  various 
 interest groups rather than the best solution to the  problem. 
Studies of business restructuring find that firms tend to ignore poor 
 performance until threatened by outside takeovers, and they systemati-
cally blame poor performance on external forces beyond their control—
such as  economic conditions (the economy), foreign competition, and rising 
prices—rather than blaming senior or middle management for poor business 
judgment.

HIGH-VELOCITY AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING
Today, many decisions made by organizations are not made by managers, or 
any humans. For instance, when you enter a query into Google’s search engine, 
Google has to decide which URLs to display in about half a second on average 
(500 milliseconds). The New York Stock Exchange spent over $450 million in 
2010–2011 to build a trading platform that executes incoming orders in less than 
50 milliseconds. High frequency traders at electronic stock exchanges execute 
their trades in under 30 milliseconds. 
The class of decisions that are highly structured and automated is  growing 
rapidly. What makes this kind of automated high-speed decision making  possible 
are computer algorithms that precisely define the steps to be followed to pro-
duce a decision, very large databases, very high-speed processors, and software 
optimized to the task. In these situations, humans (including  managers) are 
eliminated from the decision chain because they are too slow. 
This also means organizations in these areas are making decisions faster 
than what managers can monitor or control. Inability to control automated 
decisions was a major factor in the “Flash Crash” experienced by U.S. stock 
 markets on May 6, 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 
600 points in a matter of minutes before rebounding later that day. The stock 
 market was  overwhelmed by a huge wave of sell orders triggered primarily 
by high-speed computerized trading programs within a few seconds, causing 
shares of some companies like Procter & Gamble to sell for pennies. The past 
few years have seen a series of similar breakdowns in computerized trad-
ing systems, including one on August 1, 2012 when a software error caused 
Knight Capital to enter millions of faulty trades in less than an hour. The trad-
ing glitch created wild surges and plunges in nearly 150 stocks and left Knight 
with $440 million in losses.
How does the Simon framework of intelligence-design-choice-implementa-
tion work in high-velocity decision environments? Essentially, the  intelligence, 
design, choice, and implementation parts of the decision-making process are 
captured by the software’s algorithms. The humans who wrote the software 
have already identified the problem, designed a method for finding a  solution, 
defined a range of acceptable solutions, and implemented the solution. 
Obviously, with humans out of the loop, great care needs to be taken to ensure 
the proper operation of these systems lest they do significant harm to organiza-
tions and humans. 
12.2 HOW DO BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND BUSINESS 
ANALYTICS SUPPORT DECISION MAKING?
Chapter 2 introduced you to the different types of systems used for support-
ing management decision making. At the foundation of all of these decision 
 support systems are a business intelligence and business analytics infrastruc-
ture that supplies the data and the analytic tools for supporting decision making. 
In this section, we want to answer the following questions: 
• What are business intelligence (BI) and business analytics (BA) 
• Who makes business intelligence and business analytics hardware and 
 software?
• Who are the users of business intelligence?
506 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

• What kinds of analytical tools come with a BI/BA suite?
• How do managers use these tools?
• What are some examples of firms who have used these tools?
• What management strategies are used for developing BI/BA capabilities? 
WHAT IS BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE? 
“Business intelligence (BI)” is a term used by hardware and software  vendors 
and information technology consultants to describe the infrastructure for 
 warehousing, integrating, reporting, and analyzing data that come from the busi-
ness environment, including big data. The foundation infrastructure  collects, 
stores, cleans, and makes relevant information available to  managers. Think 
databases, data warehouses, data marts, Hadoop, and analytic  platforms, which 
we described in Chapter 6. “Business analytics (BA)” is also a vendor-defined 
term that focuses more on tools and techniques for analyzing and understand-
ing data. Think online analytical processing (OLAP), statistics, models, and 
data mining, which we also introduced in Chapter 6. 
Business intelligence and analytics are essentially about integrating all the 
information streams produced by a firm into a single, coherent enterprise-wide 
set of data, and then, using modeling, statistical analysis tools (like normal dis-
tributions, correlation and regression analysis, Chi square analysis, forecast-
ing, and cluster analysis), and data mining tools to make sense out of all these 
data so  managers can make better decisions and plans. The German World 
Cup soccer team described in the chapter-opening case is using business intel-
ligence and analytics to make some very fine-grained decisions about how to 
improve team and player performance. 
Business Intelligence Vendors
It is important to remember that business intelligence and analytics are products 
defined by technology vendors and consulting firms. They consist of  hardware 
and software suites sold primarily by large system vendors to very large Fortune 
500 firms. The largest five providers of these products are Oracle, SAP, IBM, 
Microsoft, and SAS. Microsoft’s products are aimed at small to medium-sized 
firms, and they are based on desktop tools familiar to employees (such as Excel 
spreadsheet software), Microsoft SharePoint collaboration tools, and Microsoft 
SQL Server database software. According to Gartner Inc., the global business 
intelligence and analytics market was $14.4 billion in 2013 (Gartner, 2014). This 
makes business intelligence and business analytics one of the fastest growing 
and largest  segments in the U.S. software market. 
THE BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE ENVIRONMENT
Figure 12.3 gives an overview of a business intelligence environment, 
 highlighting the kinds of hardware, software, and management capabilities 
that the major vendors offer and that firms develop over time. There are six 
 elements in this business intelligence environment: 
• Data from the business environment: Businesses must deal with both 
structured and unstructured data from many different sources, including 
big data. The data need to be integrated and organized so that they can be 
 analyzed and used by human decision makers.
• Business intelligence infrastructure: The underlying foundation of 
 business intelligence is a powerful database system that captures all the 
 
Chapter 12 Enhancing Decision Making 
507

relevant data to operate the business. The data may be stored in transactional 
databases or combined and integrated into an enterprise-data warehouse or 
series of interrelated data marts. 
• Business analytics toolset: A set of software tools are used to analyze 
data and produce reports, respond to questions posed by managers, and track 
the progress of the business using key indicators of performance. 
• Managerial users and methods: Business intelligence hardware 
and  software are only as intelligent as the human beings who use them. 
Managers impose order on the analysis of data using a variety of managerial 
 methods that define strategic business goals and specify how progress will be 
 measured. These include business performance management and balanced 
scorecard approaches focusing on key performance indicators and industry 
strategic analyses focusing on changes in the general business environment, 
with special attention to competitors. Without strong senior management 
oversight, business analytics can  produce a great deal of information, reports, 
and online screens that focus on the wrong matters and divert attention 
from the real issues. You need to remember that, so far, only humans can ask 
 intelligent questions. 
• Delivery platform—MIS, DSS, ESS: The results from business intel-
ligence and analytics are delivered to managers and employees in a variety 
of ways, depending on what they need to know to perform their jobs. MIS, 
DSS, and ESS, which we introduced in Chapter 2, deliver information and 
knowledge to different people and levels in the firm—operational employees, 
middle managers, and senior executives. In the past, these systems could not 
share data and operated as independent systems. Today, one suite of hard-
ware and software tools in the form of a business intelligence and analytics 
package is able to integrate all this information and bring it to managers’ 
desktop or mobile platforms. 
 FIGURE 12.3 BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYTICS FOR DECISION 
SUPPORT
Business intelligence and analytics requires a strong database foundation, a set of analytic tools, and 
an involved management team that can ask intelligent questions and analyze data. 
508 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

• User interface: Business people are no longer tied to their desks and 
 desktops. They often learn quicker from a visual representation of data than 
from a dry report with columns and rows of information. Today’s  business 
analytics  software suites feature data visualization tools, such as rich 
graphs, charts, dashboards, and maps. They also are able to deliver reports 
on BlackBerrys, iPhones, iPads, and other mobile handhelds as well as on the 
firm’s Web portal. BA software is adding capabilities to post information on 
Twitter, Facebook, or internal social media to support decision making in an 
online group setting rather than in a face-to-face meeting. 
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYTICS 
CAPABILITIES
Business intelligence and analytics promise to deliver correct, nearly  real-time 
information to decision makers, and the analytic tools help them quickly 
 understand the information and take action. There are six analytic functional-
ities that BI systems deliver to achieve these ends:
• Production reports: These are predefined reports based on industry-
specific requirements (see Table 12.4).
• Parameterized reports: Users enter several parameters as in a pivot table 
to filter data and isolate impacts of parameters. For instance, you might want 
to enter region and time of day to understand how sales of a product vary 
by region and time. If you were Starbucks, you might find that customers in 
the East buy most of their coffee in the morning, whereas in the Northwest 
 customers buy coffee throughout the day. This finding might lead to  different 
marketing and ad campaigns in each region. (See the discussion of pivot 
tables in Section 12.3.)
• Dashboards/scorecards: These are visual tools for presenting performance 
data defined by users.
• Ad hoc query/search/report creation: These allow users to create their 
own reports based on queries and searches.
• Drill down: This is the ability to move from a high-level summary to a more 
detailed view.

 FIGURE 12.4 BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE USERS
Casual users are consumers of BI output, while intense power users are the producers of reports, new 
analyses, models, and forecasts.
• Forecasts, scenarios, models: These include the ability to perform linear 
forecasting, what-if scenario analysis, and analyze data using standard 
 statistical tools.
Who Uses Business Intelligence and Business 
Analytics? 
In previous chapters, we have described the different information  constituencies 
in business firms—from senior managers to middle managers, analysts, and oper-
ational employees. This also holds true for BI and BA systems (see Figure 12.4). 
Over 80 percent of the audience for BI consists of casual users who rely largely 
on production reports. Senior executives tend to use BI to  monitor firm activi-
ties using visual interfaces like dashboards and scorecards. Middle managers and 
analysts are much more likely to be immersed in the data and software, entering 
queries and slicing and dicing the data along different dimensions. Operational 
employees will, along with customers and suppliers, be looking mostly at 
 prepackaged reports. 
Predictive Analytics
An important capability of business intelligence analytics is the ability to 
model future events and behaviors, such as the probability that a customer will 
respond to an offer to purchase a product. Predictive analytics use statistical 
analysis, data mining techniques, historical data, and assumptions about future 
conditions to predict future trends and behavior patterns. Variables that can be 
measured to predict future behavior are identified. For example, an insurance 
company might use variables such as age, gender, and driving record as predic-
tors of driving safety when issuing auto insurance policies. A collection of such 
predictors is combined into a predictive model for forecasting future probabili-
ties with an acceptable level of reliability. 
FedEx has been using predictive analytics to develop models that predict 
how customers will respond to price changes and new services, which custom-
ers are most at risk of switching to competitors, and how much revenue will be 
510 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

generated by new storefront or drop-box locations. The accuracy rate of FedEx’s 
predictive analytics system ranges from 65 to 90 percent.
Predictive analytics are being incorporated into numerous business intelli-
gence applications for sales, marketing, finance, fraud detection, and health 
care. One of the most well-known applications is credit scoring, which is used 
throughout the financial services industry. When you apply for a new credit 
card, scoring models process your credit history, loan application, and  purchase 
data to determine your likelihood of making future credit payments on time. 
Telecommunications companies use predictive analytics to identify which 
 customers are most profitable, which are most likely to leave, and which new 
services and plans will be most likely to retain customers. Health care insurers 
have been analyzing data for years to identify which patients are most likely to 
generate high costs.
Many companies employ predictive analytics to predict response to 
direct marketing campaigns. By identifying customers less likely to respond, 
 companies are able to lower their marketing and sales costs by bypassing this 
group and focusing their resources on customers who have been  identified as 
more promising. For instance, the U.S. division of The Body Shop PLC used 
 predictive analytics and its database of catalog, Web, and retail store  customers 
to identify customers who were more likely to make catalog purchases. That 
information helped the company build a more precise and targeted  mailing list 
for its catalogs, improving the response rate for catalog mailings and  catalog 
revenues.
Big Data Analytics
Predictive analytics are starting to use big data from both private and public 
sectors, including data from social media, customer transactions, and output 
from sensors and machines. In e-commerce, many online retailers have capa-
bilities for making personalized online product recommendations to their Web 
site visitors to help stimulate purchases and guide their decisions about what 
merchandise to stock. However, most of these product recommendations have 
been based on the behaviors of similar groups of customers, such as those with 
incomes under $50,000 or whose ages are between 18–25 years. Now some 
retailers are starting to analyze the tremendous quantities of online and in-
store customer data they collect along with social media data to make these 
recommendations more individualized.These efforts are translating into higher 
 customer spending and customer retention rates. Table 12.5 provides examples 
of companies using big data analytics.
In the public sector, big-data analytics has been driving the movement toward 
“smart cities,” which make intensive use of digital technology to make better 
decisions about running cities and serving their residents. Public recordkeep-
ing has produced warehouses full of property transfers, tax records, corporate 
filings, environmental compliance audits, restaurant inspections, building 
maintenance reports, mass transit appraisals, crime data, health department 
stats, public education records, utility reviews, and more. Municipalities 
are adding more data captured through sensors, location data from mobile 
phones, and targeted smartphone apps. Predictive modeling  programs now 
inform public policy decisions on utility management, transportation opera-
tion, healthcare delivery, and public safety. What’s more, the ability to evalu-
ate how changes in one service impact the operation and delivery of other 
services enables holistic problem-solving that could only be dreamed of a 
 generation ago. The Interactive Session on Technology describes how big-data 
analytics are helping New York City and Barcelona become “smarter.”

Founded in 1873, the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical 
Garden is one of the world’s top-rated zoological 
institutions, and the second oldest zoo in the United 
States. It is also one of the nation’s most popular 
attractions, a Top 10 Zagat-rated Zoo, and a Parents 
Magazine Top Zoo for Children. The Zoo’s 71-acre 
site is home to more than 500 animal and 3,000 plant 
species. About 1.3 million people visit this zoo each 
year.
Although the Zoo is a nonprofit organization par-
tially subsidized by Hamilton County, more than 
two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget is paid 
from fundraising efforts, and the remainder comes 
from admission fees, food, and gifts. To increase 
revenue and improve performance, the Zoo’s senior 
management team embarked on a comprehensive 
review of its operations. The review found that man-
agement had limited knowledge and understanding 
of what was actually happening in the Zoo on a day-
to-day basis, other than how many people visited 
every day and the Zoo’s total revenue.
Who is coming to the Zoo? How often do they 
come? What do they do and what do they buy? 
Management had no idea. Each of the Zoo’s four 
income streams—admissions, membership, retail, 
and food service—had different point-of-sale plat-
forms, and the food service business, which brings 
in $4 million a year, still relied on manual cash regis-
ters. Management had to sift through paper receipts 
just to understand daily sales totals. 
The Zoo had compiled a spreadsheet that 
 collected visitors’ zip codes, hoping to use the data 
for geographic and demographic analysis. If the data 
could be combined with insight into visitor activity 
at the Zoo—what attractions they visited, what they 
ate and drank, and what they bought at the gift shops 
—the information would be extremely valuable for 
marketing. 
To achieve this, however, the Zoo needed to 
change its information systems to focus more on 
analytics and data management. The Zoo replaced 
its four legacy point-of-sale systems with a single 
 platform—Galaxy POS from Gateway Ticketing 
Systems. It then enlisted IBM and BrightStar Partners 
(a consulting firm partnering with IBM) to build 
a centralized data warehouse and implement IBM 
Cognos Business Intelligence to provide  real-time 
analytics and reporting.
Like all outdoor attractions, the Zoo’s  business 
is highly weather-dependent. On rainy days, 
 attendance falls off sharply, often leaving the Zoo 
overstaffed and overstocked. If the weather is unusu-
ally hot, sales of certain items such as ice cream and 
bottled water are likely to rise, and the Zoo may run 
out of these items. 
The Zoo now feeds weather forecast data 
from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) Web site into its business 
intelligence system. By comparing current  forecasts 
to historic attendance and sales data during  similar 
weather conditions, the Zoo is able to make more 
accurate decisions about labor scheduling and 
 inventory planning. 
As visitors scan their membership cards at the 
Zoo’s entrance, exit, attractions, restaurants, and 
stores, or use the Zoo’s Loyalty Rewards card, the 
Zoo’s system captures these data and analyzes them 
to determine usage and spending patterns down to 
the individual customer level. This information helps 
the Zoo segment visitors based on their  spending 
and visitation behaviors and use this  information 
to  target marketing and promotions  specifically for 
each customer segment.
One customer segment the Zoo identified consisted 
of people who spent nothing other than the price of 
admissions during their visit. If each of these people 
spent $20 on their next visit to the Zoo, the Zoo would 
take in an extra $260,000, which is almost 1 percent of 
its entire budget. The Zoo used its customer informa-
tion to devise a direct mail marketing campaign in 
which this type of visitor would be offered a discount 
for some of the Zoo’s restaurants and gift shops. Loyal 
customers are also rewarded with targeted marketing 
and recognition programs.
Instead of sending a special offer to its entire 
mailing list, the Zoo is able to tailor campaigns 
more precisely to smaller groups of people, increas-
ing its chances of identifying the people who were 
most likely to respond to its mailings. More targeted 
 marketing helped the Zoo cut $40,000 from its 
annual marketing budget.
Management had observed that food sales tend to 
trail off significantly after 3 p.m. each day, and started 
closing some of the Zoo’s food outlets at that time. But 
more detailed data analysis showed that a big spike in 
soft-serve ice cream sales occurs during the last hour

Defiance’s online ticket sales increased by 700 per-
cent in 2013, but management had no idea how or 
why the increase had occurred. After consulting 
with the Cincinnati Zoo, Point Defiance purchased 
IBM Cognos 10.2. With more customizability in ticket 
offers and promotions, and more granular data avail-
able on customer demographics, the zoo has been 
able to sustain its record attendance through 2014.

ice cream outlets are open for the entire day. 
The Zoo’s Beer Hut concession features six 
 different brands, which are typically rotated based 
on sales volume and the seasons. With IBM analyt-
ics, management can now instantly identify which 
beer is selling best, on what day, and at what time 
to make sure inventory meets demand. Previously, 
it took 7 to 14 days to get this information, which 
required hiring part-time staff to sift through register 
tapes. 
The Zoo’s ability to make better decisions about 
operations has led to dramatic improvements 
in sales. Six months after deploying its business 
 intelligence solution, the Zoo achieved a 30.7  percent 
increase in food sales and a 5.9 percent increase 
in retail sales compared to the same period a year 
 earlier.
Operational Intelligence and Analytics
Some of the decisions described in the Interactive Session on smart cities deal 
with how to run the business of these cities on a day-to-day basis. These are 
largely operational decisions, and this type of business activity monitoring is 
called operational intelligence. Another example of operational intelligence 
is the use of data generated by sensors on trucks, trailers, and intermodal con-
tainers owned by Schneider National, one of North America’s largest truckload, 
logistics and intermodal services providers. The sensors monitor location, driv-
ing behaviors, fuel levels and whether a trailer or container is loaded or empty. 
Data from fuel tank sensors help Schneider identify the optimal location at 
which a driver should stop for fuel based on how much is left in the tank, the 
truck’s destination, and fuel prices en route. General Electric Company (GE) is 
using myriad sensors to collect data about heat, vibrations, and pressure inside a 
 
Chapter 12 Enhancing Decision Making 
513

massive steam-driven GE generator capable of powering 750,000 homes. These 
sensor data are  analyzed along with data on fuel costs, local weather, demand for 
power, and alternative supplies of electricity to determine the optimal generator 
performance for the conditions of the moment (Davenport, 2014).
The Internet of Things is creating huge streams of data from Web  activities, 
smartphones, sensors, gauges, and monitoring devices that can be used for 
operational intelligence about activities inside and outside the organization. 
Software for operational intelligence and analytics enables organizations to 
 analyze these streams of big data as they are generated in real time. Companies 
can set trigger alerts on events or have them fed into live dashboards to help 
managers with their decisions. For example, Schneider’s sensors capture hard 
braking in a moving truck and relay the data to corporate headquarters, where 
the data are tracked in dashboards monitoring safety metrics. The event  initiates 
a conversation between the driver and that person’s supervisor. 
Another example of operational intelligence is the use of real-time data 
in the 34th America’s Cup race, as described in the Interactive Session on 
Management. As you read this case, try to determine the extent to which 
 information technology was able to replace human decision-makers.
Location Analytics and Geographic Information 
Systems
The Interactive Session on smart cities also describes data and decisions based 
on location data. BI analytics include location analytics, the ability to gain 
business insight from the location (geographic) component of data, including 
location data from mobile phones, output from sensors or scanning devices, 
and data from maps. For example, location analytics might help a marketer 
determine which people to target with mobile ads about nearby restaurants

AMERICA’S CUP: THE TENSION BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN 
DECISION MAKERS
On September 25, 2013, Oracle Team USA pulled off 
one of the greatest comebacks in organized sports by 
winning the last race of the 34th America’s Cup Race 
on breezy San Francisco Bay. Oracle was down 8–1 
to its archrival New Zealand in the previous week 
after losing seven races in a row. Looked like a rout. 
But then a miracle: Oracle won seven races in a row. 
And in a winner-take-all finale, Oracle beat Team 
New Zealand by 44 seconds over the 12-mile race 
course before thousands of spectators lined up along 
San Francisco Bay. Both Team USA and Team New 
Zealand were the highest of high-tech boats ever to 
leave a designer’s computer screen. 
In earlier days, America’s Cup races were typically 
among single-hulled sailboats in the 70-foot range that 
looked like sailboats in the local yacht club, just more 
so: a single, long, narrow hull, and a really tall mast 
to hold the sails up. They might get up to 10 miles an 
hour on the race course.
In 2010, software billionaire Larry Ellison, founder 
of Oracle, changed all that by spending over $300 mil-
lion on a new kind of Cup racer: a three-hulled cata-
maran made of carbon fiber with what looked like an 
aircraft wing instead of a mast with sails. In two races, 
the boat, BMW Oracle USA, beat its Swiss contender, 
Alinghi. Having won the 33rd America’s Cup, Ellison 
could set the boat design and rules for the 34th race in 
2013. 
The 2013 design was a spectacular jump from tra-
ditional sailboats to 21st Century sailing machines. 
The 2013 boats were 72-foot, twin-hull catamarans 
dubbed AC72s, capable of over 50 miles per hour—
among the fastest sail boats ever built. The AC72 used 
small hydrofoils underneath the hulls that provided 
over 12,000 pounds of lift, bringing the boats out of 
the water completely, and flying like an airplane. In 
the end, it was unclear to seasoned sailors worldwide 
whether the AC72 was really a sailboat at all, but 
rather more aptly called a “sailing machine.” 
The 34th America’s Cup campaign cost Ellison $100 
million, including the cost of a single boat pegged at 
about $8 million. Oracle had two identical boats built. 
The new boats were also capable of going completely 
out of control, usually by digging their bows into the 
water, and then flipping. 
Controlling this wickedly sleek sailing machine 
requires a lightning-fast collection of massive 
amounts of data, powerful data management, rapid 
real-time data analysis, quick decision making, and 
immediate measurement of the results. In short, all 
the information technologies needed by a modern 
business firm. When you can perform all these tasks 
thousands of times in an hour, you can incremen-
tally improve your performance and have an over-
whelming advantage over less IT-savvy opponents 
on race day. For Team USA, this meant using 250 
sensors on the wing, hull, and rudder to gather real-
time data on pressure, angles, loads, and strains to 
monitor the effectiveness of each adjustment. The 
sensors track 4,000 variables, 10 times a second, 
producing 90 million data points an hour. The sen-
sors are wired to an onboard server that processes 
the information, and sends it out on a wireless net-
work to crew member wrist displays. Managing all 
these data is Oracle Database 11g data management 
software. The data are also wirelessly transferred to 
a tender ship running Oracle 11g for near real-time 
analysis using a family of formulas (called velocity 
prediction formulas) geared to understanding what 
makes the boat go fast. Oracle’s Application Express 
presentation graphics summarize the millions of 
data points and present the boat managers with 
charts that make sense of the information. The data 
are also sent to Oracle’s Austin data center for more 
in-depth analysis. Using powerful data analysis 
tools, USA managers were able to find relationships 
they had never thought about before. Over several 
months of practice, from day one to the day before 
the race, the crew of Team USA could chart a steady 
improvement in performance. For the first time in 
history, it seemed possible to leave sailing to the 
computer hardware and software. 
Each Team USA crew member wore a small mobile 
handheld computer on his wrist to display data on 
the key performance variables customized for that 
person’s responsibilities, such as the load balance on a 
specific rope or the current aerodynamic performance 
of the wing sail. The captain and tactician had data 
displayed on their sunglasses. In this way, each crew 
member gets the data he needs instantly to perform 
his job. The crew was trained to sail like pilots look-
ing at instruments, rather than sailors looking at the 
boat and sea for clues. Professional and amateur sail-
ors across the world wondered if the technology had

difference was seconds per mile, which, all other things 
being equal, adds up to victory in a 12-mile race. The 
sailors claimed the engineers’ software was just wrong.
In the end, Team USA pursued both solutions: 
multiple small changes were made in the boat hull 
and underwater foils, and on the race course. Spithill 
and his team stopped looking so much at their wrist 
computer screens, and started to act like sailors on a 
race course rather than drone pilots in an office. Team 
USA won every upwind leg of the last eight races. The 
engineers admitted their software models were not 
providing accurate advice.

transformed sailing into something else, something 
akin to flying drones from a desk. 
So, why did Team USA lose seven races in a row, 
and how was Oracle able to pull out a victory? After 
the seventh loss, skipper James Spithill called for a 
one-day “time-out” allowed by the rules. Team USA 
was losing the upwind legs of all the races where Team 
New Zealand had the edge. The sailors and engineers 
disagreed about the solution. The engineers called for 
boat modifications, while the sailors called for more 
attention to be paid to sailing and less attention to mon-
itoring their wrist computers. In training for the races, 
the sailors were told to listen to the engineers who had 
the best technology to predict boat speeds. The engi-
neers’ software program told them to sail Team USA as 
close as possible to wind on the upwind legs (about 45 
degrees to the wind), but the sailors’ observations of 
the actual races suggested New Zealand was winning 
because it sailed five degrees off the wind at about 50 
degrees, sailing a longer but faster upwind course. The

and stores, or quantify the impact of mobile ads on in-store visits. Location 
analytics would help a utility company view and measure outages and their 
associated costs as related to customer location to help prioritize marketing, 
system upgrades and customer service efforts. UPS’s package tracking and 
delivery-routing systems described in Chapter 1 use location analytics, as does 
an application used by Starbucks to determine where to open new stores. The 
Starbucks application identifies geographic locations that will produce a high 
sales-to-investment ratio and per-store sales volume.
The Starbucks application and some of the New York City systems 
described earlier are examples of geographic information systems (GIS). 
GIS provide tools to help decision makers visualize problems that benefit 
from mapping. GIS software ties location data about the distribution of 
people or other resources to points, lines, and areas on a map. Some GIS 
have modeling capabilities for changing the data and automatically revising 
business scenarios. 
GIS might be used to help state and local governments calculate response 
times to natural disasters and other emergencies or to help banks identify the 
best location for new branches or ATM terminals. For example, Columbia, 
South Carolina-based First Citizens Bank uses MapInfo GIS software to deter-
mine which markets to focus on for retaining customers and which to focus 
on for acquiring new customers. The GIS software also lets the bank drill 
down into details at the individual branch level and individualize goals for 
each branch. Each branch is able to see whether the greatest revenue oppor-
tunities are from mining its database of existing customers or from finding 
new customers.
MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR DEVELOPING BI AND 
BA CAPABILITIES 
There are two different strategies for adopting BI and BA capabilities for the 
organization: one-stop integrated solutions versus multiple best-of-breed vendor 
solutions. The hardware firms (IBM, HP, and now Oracle, which owns Sun 
Microsystems) want to sell your firm integrated hardware/software  solutions 
that tend to run only on their hardware (the totally integrated solution). It’s 
called “one-stop shopping.” The software firms (SAP, SAS, and Microsoft) 
encourage firms to adopt the “best-of-breed” software that runs on any machine 
they want. In this strategy, you adopt the best database and data  warehouse 
solution, and select the business intelligence and analytics package from what-
ever vendor you believe is best. 
The first solution carries the risk that a single vendor provides your firm’s 
total hardware and software solution, making your firm dependent on its 
 pricing power. However, it offers the advantage of dealing with a single vendor 
who can deliver on a global scale. The second solution offers greater flexibil-
ity and independence, but with the risk of potential difficulties integrating the 
 software to the hardware platform, as well as to other software. Vendors always 
claim their software is “compatible” with other software, but the reality is that it 
can be very difficult to integrate software from different vendors. 
Regardless of which strategy your firm adopts, all BI and BA systems lock the 
firm into a set of vendors and switching is very costly. Once you train thousands 
of employees across the world on using a particular set of tools, it is extremely 
difficult to switch. When you adopt these systems, you are in essence taking in 
a new partner.

12.3 HOW DO DIFFERENT DECISION-MAKING 
CONSTITUENCIES IN AN ORGANIZATION USE 
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE? WHAT IS THE ROLE 
OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN HELPING PEOPLE 
WORKING IN A GROUP MAKE DECISIONS MORE 
EFFICIENTLY? 
There are many different constituencies that make up a modern business 
firm. Earlier in this text and in this chapter we identified three levels of 
 management: lower supervisory (operational) management, middle manage-
ment, and senior management (vice president and above, including executive 
or “C level”  management, e.g. chief executive officer, chief financial officers, 
and chief operational officer.) Each of these management groups has different 
 responsibilities and different needs for information and business intelligence, 
with decisions becoming less structured among higher levels of management 
(review Figure 12.1).
DECISION SUPPORT FOR OPERATIONAL AND MIDDLE 
MANAGEMENT
Operational and middle management are generally charged with monitoring 
the performance of key aspects of the business, ranging from the down-time 
of machines on a factory floor, to the daily or even hourly sales at franchise 
food stores, to the daily traffic at a company’s Web site. Most of the decisions 
they make are fairly structured. Management information systems (MIS) are 
 typically used by middle managers to support this type of decision making, 
and their  primary output is a set of routine production reports based on data 
extracted and summarized from the firm’s underlying transaction processing 
systems (TPS). Increasingly, middle managers receive these reports online 
on the  company portal, and are able to interactively query the data to find 
out why events are happening. To save even more analysis time, managers 
turn to  exception reports, which highlight only exceptional conditions, such as 
when the sales quotas for a specific territory fall below an anticipated level or 
employees have exceeded their spending limits in a dental care plan. Table 12.6 
provides some examples of MIS applications.

Support for Semistructured Decisions
Some managers are “super users” and keen business analysts who want to 
 create their own reports, and use more sophisticated analytics and models to 
find  patterns in data, to model alternative business scenarios, or to test  specific 
hypotheses. Decision-support systems (DSS) are the BI delivery  platform for this 
category of users, with the ability to support semistructured decision making. 
DSS rely more heavily on modeling than MIS, using mathematical or 
 analytical models to perform what-if or other kinds of analysis. “What-if” analy-
sis, working forward from known or assumed conditions, allows the user to 
vary certain values to test results to predict outcomes if changes occur in those 
 values. What happens if we raise product prices by 5 percent or increase the 
advertising budget by $1 million? Sensitivity analysis models ask  what-if 
 questions repeatedly to predict a range of outcomes when one or more  variables 
are changed multiple times (see Figure 12.5). Backward sensitivity analysis 
helps decision makers with goal seeking: If I want to sell 1 million product units 
next year, how much must I reduce the price of the product?
Chapter 6 described multidimensional data analysis and OLAP as one of the 
key business intelligence technologies. Spreadsheets have a similar feature for 
multidimensional analysis called a pivot table, which manager “super users” 
and analysts employ to identify and understand patterns in business informa-
tion that may be useful for semistructured decision making. 
Figure 12.6 illustrates a Microsoft Excel pivot table that examines a large list 
of order transactions for a company selling online management training videos 
and books. It shows the relationship between two dimensions: the sales region 
and the source of contact (Web banner ad or e-mail) for each  customer order. 
It answers the question: does the source of the customer make a  difference 
in addition to region? The pivot table in this figure shows that most custom-
ers come from the West and that banner advertising produces most of the 
 customers in all the regions. 
One of the Hands-On MIS projects for this chapter asks you to use a pivot 
table to find answers to a number of other questions using the same list of 
transactions for the online training company as we used in this discussion. The 
 complete Excel file for these transactions is available in MyMISLab. We have 
also added a Learning Track on creating pivot tables using Excel. 
 FIGURE 12.5 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
This table displays the results of a sensitivity analysis of the effect of changing the sales price of a necktie and the cost per unit on the 
product’s break-even point. It answers the question, “What happens to the break-even point if the sales price and the cost to make each 
unit increase or decrease?”

In the past, much of this modeling was done with spreadsheets and small 
stand-alone databases. Today these capabilities are incorporated into large 
 enterprise BI systems where they are able to analyze data from large corpo-
rate databases. BI analytics include tools for intensive modeling, some of which 
we described earlier. Such capabilities help Progressive Insurance identify the 
best customers for its products. Using widely available insurance industry data, 
Progressive defines small groups of customers, or “cells,” such as motorcycle 
 riders aged 30 or above with college educations, credit scores over a certain 
level, and no accidents. For each “cell,” Progressive performs a regression 
 analysis to identify factors most closely correlated with the insurance losses 
that are typical for this group. It then sets prices for each cell, and uses simula-
tion  software to test whether this pricing arrangement will enable the company 
to make a profit. These analytic techniques, make it possible for Progressive 
to profitably insure customers in traditionally high-risk categories that other 
insurers would have rejected.
DECISION SUPPORT FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT: 
BALANCED SCORECARD AND ENTERPRISE 
PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT METHODS
The purpose of executive support systems (ESS), introduced in Chapter 2, is 
to help C-level executive managers focus on the really important performance 
information that affect the overall profitability and success of the firm. There 
are two parts to developing ESS. First, you will need a methodology for under-
standing exactly what is “the really important performance information” for 
a specific firm that executives need, and second, you will need to develop 
systems capable of delivering this information to the right people in a timely 
fashion.
 FIGURE 12.6 A PIVOT TABLE THAT EXAMINES CUSTOMER REGIONAL 
DISTRIBUTION AND ADVERTISING SOURCE 
In this pivot table, we are able to examine where an online training company’s customers come from 
in terms of region and advertising source.
520 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

Currently, the leading methodology for understanding the really important 
information needed by a firm’s executives is called the balanced scorecard 
method (Kaplan and Norton, 2004; Kaplan and Norton, 1992). The balanced 
score card is a framework for operationalizing a firm’s strategic plan by  focusing 
on measurable outcomes on four dimensions of firm performance: financial, 
business process, customer, and learning and growth (Figure 12.7). 
Performance on each dimension is measured using key performance 
 indicators (KPIs), which are the measures proposed by senior management 
for understanding how well the firm is performing along any given dimension. 
For instance, one key indicator of how well an online retail firm is meeting 
its customer performance objectives is the average length of time required to 
deliver a package to a consumer. If your firm is a bank, one KPI of business 
 process performance is the length of time required to perform a basic function 
like  creating a new customer account. 
The balanced scorecard framework is thought to be “balanced” because it 
causes managers to focus on more than just financial performance. In this 
view, financial performance is past history—the result of past actions—and 
managers should focus on the things they are able to influence today, such 
as  business process efficiency, customer satisfaction, and employee training. 
Once a scorecard is developed by consultants and senior executives, the next 
step is  automating a flow of information to executives and other managers 
for each of the key performance indicators. There are literally hundreds of 
 consulting and software firms that offer these capabilities, which are described 
below. Once these systems are implemented, they are often referred to as 
ESS. 
 FIGURE 12.7 THE BALANCED SCORECARD FRAMEWORK 
In the balanced scorecard framework, the firm’s strategic objectives are operationalized along four 
dimensions: financial, business process, customer, and learning and growth. Each dimension is 
measured using several KPIs. 
 
Chapter 12 Enhancing Decision Making 
521

Another closely related popular management methodology is business 
 performance management (BPM). Originally defined by an industry group 
in 2004 (led by the same companies that sell enterprise and database systems 
like Oracle, SAP, and IBM), BPM attempts to systematically translate a firm’s 
strategies (e.g., differentiation, low-cost producer, market share growth, and 
scope of operation) into operational targets. Once the strategies and targets are 
identified, a set of KPIs are developed that measure progress towards the tar-
gets. The firm’s performance is then measured with information drawn from 
the firm’s enterprise database systems. BPM uses the same ideas as balanced 
scorecard but with a stronger strategy flavor. 
Corporate data for contemporary ESS are supplied by the firm’s existing 
enterprise applications (enterprise resource planning, supply chain manage-
ment, and customer relationship management). ESS also provide access to 
news  services, financial market databases, economic information, and  whatever 
other external data senior executives require. ESS also have significant drill-
down capabilities if managers need more detailed views of data. 
Well-designed ESS help senior executives monitor organizational  performance, 
track activities of competitors, recognize changing market  conditions, and 
i dentify problems and opportunities. Employees lower down in the  corporate 
hierarchy also use these systems to monitor and measure  business  performance 
in their areas of responsibility. For these and other business intelligence 
 systems to be truly useful, the information must be “actionable”—it must be 
readily available and also easy to use when making decisions. If users have dif-
ficulty identifying critical metrics within the reports they receive, employee 
productivity and business performance will suffer. 
GROUP DECISION-SUPPORT SYSTEMS (GDSS) 
The DSS we have just described focus primarily on individual decision making. 
However, so much work is accomplished in groups within firms that a special 
category of systems called group decision-support systems (GDSS) has been 
developed to support group and organizational decision making. 
A GDSS is an interactive computer-based system for facilitating the  solution 
of unstructured problems by a set of decision makers working together as a 
group in the same location or in different locations. Collaboration systems 
and Web-based tools for videoconferencing and electronic meetings described 
 earlier in this text support some group decision processes, but their focus is 
 primarily on communication. GDSS, however, provide tools and technologies 
geared explicitly toward group decision making. 
GDSS-guided meetings take place in conference rooms with special hardware 
and software tools to facilitate group decision making. The hardware includes 
computer and networking equipment, overhead projectors, and display screens. 
Special electronic meeting software collects, documents, ranks, edits, and stores 
the ideas offered in a decision-making meeting. The more elaborate GDSS use 
a professional facilitator and support staff. The facilitator selects the software 
tools and helps organize and run the meeting. 
A sophisticated GDSS provides each attendee with a dedicated desktop 
 computer under that person’s individual control. No one will be able to see 
what individuals do on their computers until those participants are ready to 
share information. Their input is transmitted over a network to a central server 
that stores information generated by the meeting and makes it available to all 
on the meeting network. Data can also be projected on a large screen in the 
meeting room. 
522 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

GDSS make it possible to increase meeting size while at the same time 
increasing productivity because individuals contribute simultaneously 
rather than one at a time. A GDSS promotes a collaborative atmosphere by 
 guaranteeing  contributors’ anonymity so that attendees focus on evaluating 
the ideas themselves without fear of personally being criticized or of having 
their ideas rejected based on the contributor. GDSS software tools follow 
structured  methods for organizing and evaluating ideas and for preserving the 
results of meetings, enabling nonattendees to locate needed information after 
the  meeting. GDSS effectiveness depends on the nature of the problem and 
the group and on how well a meeting is planned and conducted. 
Review Summary
1. What are the different types of decisions and how does the decision-making process work? How do 
information systems support the activities of managers and management decision making?
The different levels in an organization (strategic, management, operational) have different 
 decision-making requirements. Decisions can be structured, semistructured, or unstructured, with 
structured  decisions clustering at the operational level of the organization and unstructured decisions 
at the strategic level. Decision making can be performed by individuals or groups and includes 
 employees as well as operational, middle, and senior managers. There are four stages in decision 
 making: intelligence, design, choice, and implementation. Systems to support decision making do not 
always produce better manager and employee decisions that improve firm performance because of 
problems with information quality, management filters, and organizational culture.
Early classical models of managerial activities stress the functions of planning, organizing, 
 coordinating, deciding, and controlling. Contemporary research looking at the actual behavior of 
 managers has found that managers’ real activities are highly fragmented, variegated, and brief in 
 duration and that managers shy away from making grand, sweeping policy decisions.
Information technology provides new tools for managers to carry out both their traditional and 
newer roles, enabling them to monitor, plan, and forecast with more precision and speed than ever 
before and to respond more rapidly to the changing business environment. Information systems 
have been most helpful to managers by providing support for their roles in disseminating  information, 
providing liaisons between organizational levels, and allocating resources. However, information 
systems are less successful at  supporting unstructured decisions. Where information systems are 
useful, information quality, management filters, and organizational culture can degrade  decision 
making.
2. How do business intelligence and business analytics support decision making?
Business intelligence and analytics promise to deliver correct, nearly real-time information to 
 decision makers, and the analytic tools help them quickly understand the information and take action. 
A business intelligence environment consists of data from the business environment, the BI 
 infrastructure, a BA toolset, managerial users and methods, a BI delivery platform (MIS, DSS, or ESS), 
and the user interface. There are six analytic functionalities that BI systems deliver to achieve these 
ends: predefined production reports, parameterized reports, dashboards and scorecards, ad hoc  queries 
and searches, the ability to drill down to detailed views of data, and the ability to model scenarios and 
 create forecasts. 
3. How do different decision-making constituencies in an organization use business intelligence? What is 
the role of information systems in helping people working in a group make decisions more efficiently? 
Operational and middle management are generally charged with monitoring the performance of 
their firm. Most of the decisions they make are fairly structured. Management information systems 
(MIS) producing routine  production reports are typically used to support this type of decision making. 
For making unstructured  decisions, middle managers and analysts will use decision-support systems 
(DSS) with powerful analytics and modeling tools, including spreadsheets and pivot tables. Senior 
executives  making unstructured decisions use dashboards and visual interfaces displaying key

How Much Does Data-Driven Planting Help Farmers?
CASE STUDY
L
ike many other businesses, farming is being 
reshaped by information technology. Many 
tractors and combines today are guided by 
Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite-
based navigation systems. The GPS computer receives 
signals from earth-orbiting satellites to track each 
piece of equipment’s location and where it has gone. 
The system issues instructions for hoses to deliver 
precise amounts of fertilizer right into the grooves 
cut by the tiller. The system helps steer the equip-
ment, so farmers are able to monitor progress on 
iPads and other tablet computers in their tractor cabs. 
Placing seed and fertilizer together with this level of 
 precision means farmers need to use fewer loads of 
fertilizer, potentially saving an individual farmer tens 
of  thousands of dollars. 
Now big agricultural companies like Monsanto 
and Dupont want to do more. Since adjustments in 
planting depth or the distance between crop rows 
can make a big difference in crop yields, these 
 companies want their computers to analyze the 
data generated during this computerized planting 
work to show farmers how to further increase their 
crop  output. This practice is also known as predic-
tive planting. Proponents say prescriptive plant-
ing will spark an agricultural revolution rivalling 
the  introduction of mechanized tractors in the first 
half of the 20th century and the rise of genetically 
 modified seeds in the 1990s.
Here’s how prescriptive planting works: The 
farmer provides data on field boundaries, historic 
crop yields, and soil conditions to an agricultural 
data analysis company, which analyzes the data 
along with other data it has collected about seed 
performance and soil types in different areas. The 
company then sends a computer file with recom-
mendations back to the farmer, who uploads the data 
into computerized planting equipment. The farmer’s 
planting equipment follows the recommendations as 
it plants fields. For example, the recommendations 
might tell an Iowa corn farmer to lower the num-
ber of seeds planted per acre or to plant more seeds 
per acre in specified portions of the field capable of 
growing more corn. The farmer might also receive 
advice on the exact type of seed to plant in different 
areas. The data analysis company monitors weather 
and other factors to advise farmers how to manage 
crops as they grow. 
A new software application developed by 
Monsanto called FieldScripts takes into account 
 variables such as the amount of sunlight and shade, 
and variations in soil nitrogen and phosphorous 
 content down to an area as small as a 10-meter by 
 10-meter grid. Monsanto then analyzes the data in 
conjunction with the genetic properties of their 
seeds, combines all this information with climate 
predictions, and delivers precise planting instruc-
tions or “scripts” to iPads connected to planting 
equipment in the field. Tools such as FieldScripts 
would allow farmers to pinpoint areas that need 
more or less fertilizer, saving them the cost of 
spreading fertilizer everywhere, while boosting their 
yields in areas that have performed more poorly and 
reducing the amount of excess fertilizer that enters 
the water table. So, predictive planting could also be 
good for the environment.
Prescriptive planting could help improve the 
 average corn harvest to more than 200 bushels an 
acre from the current 160 bushels, some experts say. 
Such a gain would generate an extra $182 an acre in 
revenue for farmers, based on recent prices. (Iowa 
corn farmers received about $759 an acre in 2013.) 
On a larger scale, according to Monsanto, the world’s 
largest seed company, data-driven planting advice to 
farmers could increase worldwide crop production 
by about $20 billion a year. So far, output from pre-
dictive planting systems has not achieved those spec-
tacular levels. Farmers who use prescriptive planting 
report their yields rising by 5 to 10 bushels per acre.
The costs of investing in the new technology and 
vendor service fees can amount to more than what 
many small farmers can earn in extra yield from 
their farms. According to Sara Olson of Lux Research 
Inc., the problem with precision agriculture is the 
diminishing returns that come along with costly 
technologies on smaller farms. That means that only 
the really big farms are likely to benefit.
Monsanto estimates that FieldScripts will improve 
yields by 5 to 10 bushels per acre. With corn at 
around $4 per bushel, that’s an increase of $20–$40 
per acre. A small farm, of about 500 acres, could 
get anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 in extra 
 revenue. Monsanto charges around $10 per acre 
for the service, so the farm will wind up paying 
around $5,000—in addition to paying tens of thou-
sands of dollars to either retrofit its existing planting

equipment or buy more modern tractors that include 
the  electronics gear that syncs the “scripts” provided 
by the Monsanto online service with the planter’s 
onboard navigation systems. Monsanto also charges 
an extra $15 per acre for its local climate prediction 
service. A small farm will most likely lose money or 
break even for the first two years of using a service 
like FieldScripts, according to Olson.
For large farm of about 5,000 acres, FieldScripts 
could increase revenues increase by between 
$100,000 and $200,000. With Monsanto’s service 
 costing around $50,000, that farm’s total profits 
will run between $50,000 to $150,000, more than 
 sufficient to offset the cost of updating farm machin-
ery. Whether a farm is big or small the impact of 
FieldScripts would be minimal in good years because 
yields would be high regardless. Steve Pitstick, who 
owns a 2,600-acre corn and soybean farm near 
DeKalb, Ill., said that the technology is likely to have 
a bigger impact in years when conditions aren’t so 
good. Since Midwest farming conditionswere good 
in 2013, Pitstick found that yields from fields that he 
managed using FieldScripts were only between 1 per-
cent and 2 percent higher than fields where he didn’t 
use the service.
A spokesperson for Monsanto stated that the 
 outcome of predictive planting is less about the size 
of the farm and more about the farmer’s technology 
know-how. A wide range of farmers are currently 
using various types of precision agriculture technol-
ogy. Both small-and large-scale farmers dealing with 
various crops and production methods are increas-
ingly looking for new technologies and tools that can 
improve their yields while managing their overall 
risk. According to Michael Cox, co-director of invest-
ment research at securities firm Piper Jaffray Cos., 
revenue from FieldScripts and other technology-
driven products and services could account for 20 
percent of Monsanto’s projected growth in per-share 
earnings by 2018.
Although some farmers have embraced  predictive 
planting, others are critical. Many farmers are 
 worried about the intrusion of big data into their 
once-insular businesses and are especially  suspicious 
of what Monsanto and DuPont might do with the 
collected data. Others worry about seed prices  rising 
too much, since the companies that developed 
 predictive planting technology are the same ones 
that sell seeds. Farmers also fear that rivals could 
use the data to their own advantage. For instance, 
if nearby  farmers saw crop-yield information, they 
might rush to rent farmland, pushing land and other 
costs higher. Other farmers worry that Wall Street 
traders could use the data to make bets on futures 
contracts. If such bets push futures-contract prices 
lower early in the growing season, it might squeeze 
the profits farmers could lock in for their crops by 
selling futures.
There are not yet any publicly known examples 
where a farmer’s prescriptive-planting informa-
tion has been misused. Monsanto and DuPont 
 officials say the companies have no plans to sell data 
 gathered from farmers. Deere& Co., which working 
with DuPont and Dow Chemical Co. to  formulate 
specialized seed-planting recommendations based 
on data from its tractors, combines and other 
 machinery, says it obtains consent from customers 
before  sharing any of their data.
Kip Tom has been testing Monsanto’s system on 
his 20,000-acre farm near Leesburg, Indiana, for 
about three years. He claims he would not plant a 
single acre without it. But he keeps close tabs on how 
data flow from and to his farm machinery. In 2013, 
Mr. Tom unplugged a cable inside one of his combine 
to prevent it from capturing details of his  planting 
 algorithm as he harvested corn. The  combine’s 
 manufacturer didn’t develop that information, so 
Tom didn’t believe it should have access to it.
Some farmers have discussed aggregating  planting 
data on their own so they could decide what 
 information to sell and at what price. Other  farmers 
are working with smaller technology  companies 
that are trying to keep agricultural giants from 
dominating the prescriptive-planting business. 
Steve Cubbage, owner of Prime Meridian LLC in 
Nevada, Missouri, one of these small companies, 
says his company’s independence from the seed, 
machinery and chemical industry adds credibility. 
About one hundred farmers use Prime Meridian’s 
 precision-seeding service, and Cubbage expects the 
 number to increase dramatically. The  company 
is developing a system to store farm-by-farm 
 information on an online Web-based service that 
could give access to seed dealers, financial advisers 
and other outsiders approved by farmers.
The American Farm Bureau Federation, a trade 
group for farmers, has warned members that seed 
companies touting higher crop yields from prescrip-
tive planting have a vested interest in persuading 
farmers to plant more. The Federation also says the 
services might steer farmers to buy certain seeds, 
sprays and equipment for their land. The Farm 
Bureau has held internal talks about whether the 
trade group should set up its own computer  servers 
as a data storehouse, but no decision has been 
reached.
528 Part Three Key System Applications for the Digital Age

Brian Dunn, who grows wheat, corn and  sorghum 
on 2,500 acres near St. John, Kansas, believes that 
big companies can help in the short-term, but 
is skeptical about the long-term. He uses Prime 
Meridian’s service.
In a move to ease farmers’ worries, Monsanto said 
last month that it supports industrywide standards 
for managing information collected from fields. The 
company aims to build a free online data storehouse 
where farmers could upload information ranging 
from crop yields to planting dates. Monsanto says it 
wouldn’t access the data without permission from 
farmers.
One reason that suspicions run deep among some 
farmers: a surge in seed prices as the biggest compa-
nies increased their market share during the past fif-
teen years, largely through takeovers. Monsanto and 
DuPont now sell about 70 percent of all corn seed in 
the U.S. In 2013, farmers paid about $118 an acre for 
corn seed, up 166 percent from the inflation-adjusted 
cost of $45 an acre in 2005, according to Purdue 
University estimates. The seed companies say the 
higher prices reflect the benefits of using their 
genetically modified seeds, including bigger crops 
and resistance to insects and weed-killing sprays that 
have helped reduce the usage of harmful pesticides.

oes your kitchen sink have a single-handle faucet or two faucets? If 
it’s one with a single handle, it was invented in 1939 by Al Moen, 
founder of Moen, Incorporated, the number one faucet brand in 
North America. Based in North Olmsted, Ohio, Moen manufactures 
and sells a wide range of kitchen and bath products, including sinks, shower-
heads, and numerous accessories. New products are constantly being 
launched, and each requires numerous capital expense requests throughout 
the product development process.
Moen has three manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and one in China, as 
well as two distribution facilities in the U.S., one in China, and one in Canada 
and Mexico. The company had implemented a single instance of the SAP 
enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for nearly every line of its  business 
worldwide, including supply chain, sales, service, and manufacturing. As a 
result, many of Moen’s automated business processes were streamlined and 
efficient. Until recently, the process for initiating a capital expense request 
was one of the exceptions.
Moen’s process to initiate a capital expense request (CER) was heavily 
 manual. First, a user submitted a paper form that was routed manually through 
the corporate office from inbox to inbox to obtain the proper supporting 
 documentation and approvals. The exact route differed, depending on factors 
such as type and amount of funds requested, department of origin, and level 
of approval needed. This process was very inefficient and uncertain. Among 
Moen’s 300 employees involved in the capital expense request process, only a 
few outside of the finance department understood where and how the request 
NEW SYSTEMS HELP WORK FLOW MORE 
SMOOTHLY AT MOEN

was being routed. Finance would know if required approvals were insufficient, 
but getting to that department involved a great deal of guesswork from people 
who weren’t sure of exactly where a form needed to go. Manually-routed 
 documents could be easily lost or misplaced, leaving the other people along the 
approval chain completely unaware of the request. Making matters worse, 
CERs originating in Moen’s Chinese manufacturing facility had to be mailed to 
the corporate office, increasing chances of getting lost. The recipient of these 
overseas requests couldn’t just walk down the hallway to ask the sender a 
 question.
Moen needed a solution that automated business form development and 
routing and that could easily integrate with its global SAP ERP system and 
 support yearly upgrades to the SAP software. There were other requirements: 
The system had to be easy to use, with business users capable of automating 
select processes with a minimum of IT support. The solution also had to easily 
 integrate with Microsoft SharePoint, which was supporting other internal Moen 
processes. And management did not want to limit the solution to CERs; it 
wanted the selected tool to automate other processes as well.
With assistance from Clear Process Solutions as consultants, Moen selected 
Winshuttle workflow software in November 2013. Winshuttle enables users to 
build and adapt Excel and SharePoint-based interactive forms and workflows for 
SAP without costly custom development and without compromising on  security 
or control. The software integrates easily with both SharePoint and SAP, and 
can be tailored to Moen’s processes. It is able to provide complete visibility into 
exactly where a request is located within the routing process.
It took five months to implement Winshuttle. During that time, users were 
given training classes on how to build a workflow using the software. Gina 
Carlson, Moen’s Director of Asia Pacific Customer Relationship and Financial 
Systems, also instituted a formal communication plan with additional training 
documents, Webinars, and IT town halls.
Before automation, the CER process took anywhere from four to ten business 
days, depending on the number of approvals required. After Winshuttle was 
implemented, even complex and high-profile CERs can be processed in one to 
two business days. Moen is able to see the status of a particular CER at any 
point in the processing cycle. Carlson and her colleagues are able to know at 
any time where a specific funding request is in the pipeline, who has seen it, 
and who needs to approve it.
Within the first month after the system went live, almost 70 Moen employees 
used the new automated CER process. With management anticipating savings 
from automating CER of two hours per person, the project is expected to pay for 
itself within three months. The days of tracking down paper-based forms at 
Moen are coming to an end.

T
he experience of Moen illustrates some of the steps required to design 
and build new information systems. Building a new system for 
 processing capital expense requests entailed analyzing the organization’s 
problems with existing systems, assessing information requirements,  selecting 
appropriate technology, and redesigning business processes and jobs. 
Management had to oversee the systems-building effort and evaluate benefits 
and costs. The new information system represented a process of planned 
organizational change.
534 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

The chapter-opening case calls attention to important points raised by this 
case and this chapter. Moen’s process for handling capital expense requests was 
hampered by outdated and inefficient manual processes, which raised costs, 
slowed down work, and limited the company’s ability to develop new products.
Management decided to redesign and automate this process using new 
 workflow software that enables users to create interactive forms and workflows 
for SAP without costly custom development. The solution encompassed not 
just the application of new technology, but changes to corporate culture, 
 business  processes, and job functions. Moen’s pace of work and approvals for 
new capital expenditures have become much faster.
Here are some questions to think about: Why was Winshuttle software a good 
choice for Moen? How much did the new system change the way Moen ran its 
business?
13.1 HOW DOES BUILDING NEW SYSTEMS PRODUCE 
ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE?
B
uilding a new information system is one kind of planned organiza-
tional change. The introduction of a new information system involves 
much more than new hardware and software. It also includes changes 
in jobs, skills, management, and organization. When we design a new 
information system, we are redesigning the organization. System builders 
must understand how a system will affect specific business processes and the 
 organization as a whole.
SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND ORGANIZATIONAL 
CHANGE
Information technology can promote various degrees of organizational change, 
ranging from incremental to far-reaching. Figure 13.1 shows four kinds of 
 structural organizational change that are enabled by information technol-
ogy: (1) automation, (2) rationalization, (3) business process redesign, and (4) 
 paradigm shifts. Each carries different risks and rewards.
 
Chapter 13 Building Information Systems 
535

 FIGURE 13.1  ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE CARRIES RISKS AND REWARDS
The most common forms of organizational change are automation and rationalization. These relatively 
slow-moving and slow-changing strategies present modest returns but little risk. Faster and more 
comprehensive change—such as redesign and paradigm shifts—carries high rewards but offers 
substantial chances of failure.
The most common form of IT-enabled organizational change is automation. 
The first applications of information technology involved assisting  employees 
with performing their tasks more efficiently and effectively. Calculating 
 paychecks and payroll registers, giving bank tellers instant access to customer 
deposit records, and developing a nationwide reservation network for airline 
ticket agents are all examples of early automation.
A deeper form of organizational change—one that follows quickly from 
early automation—is rationalization of procedures. Automation frequently 
reveals new bottlenecks in production and makes the existing arrange-
ment of  procedures and structures painfully cumbersome. Rationalization of 
 procedures is the streamlining of standard operating procedures. For example, 
Moen’s new system for capital expense requests is effective not only because 
it uses computer technology but also because the company simplified its busi-
ness processes for this function. Fewer manual steps are required.
Rationalization of procedures is often found in programs for making a series 
of continuous quality improvements in products, services, and operations, such 
as total quality management (TQM) and six sigma. Total quality manage-
ment (TQM) makes achieving quality an end in itself and the responsibility 
of all people and functions within an organization. TQM derives from concepts 
developed by American quality experts such as W. Edwards Deming and Joseph 
Juran, but it was popularized by the Japanese. Six sigma is a specific  measure 
of quality, representing 3.4 defects per million opportunities. Most compa-
nies cannot achieve this level of quality, but use six sigma as a goal for driving 
 ongoing quality improvement programs.
536 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

A more powerful type of organizational change is business process 
 redesign, in which business processes are analyzed, simplified, and  redesigned. 
Business process redesign reorganizes workflows, combining steps to cut waste 
and  eliminate repetitive, paper-intensive tasks. (Sometimes the new design 
 eliminates jobs as well.) It is much more ambitious than rationalization of 
 procedures, requiring a new vision of how the process is to be organized.
A widely cited example of business process redesign is Ford Motor Company’s 
invoiceless processing, which reduced headcount in Ford’s North American 
Accounts Payable organization of 500 people by 75 percent. Accounts  payable 
clerks used to spend most of their time resolving discrepancies between 
 purchase orders, receiving documents, and invoices. Ford redesigned its 
accounts payable process so that the purchasing department enters a purchase 
order into an online database that can be checked by the receiving department 
when the ordered items arrive. If the received goods match the purchase order, 
the system automatically generates a check for accounts payable to send to the 
vendor. There is no need for vendors to send invoices.
Rationalizing procedures and redesigning business processes are limited to 
specific parts of a business. New information systems can ultimately affect the 
design of the entire organization by transforming how the organization  carries 
out its business or even the nature of the business. For instance, the long-
haul trucking and transportation firm Schneider National used new informa-
tion  systems to change its business model. Schneider created a new business 
 managing logistics for other companies. This more radical form of business 
change is called a paradigm shift. A paradigm shift involves rethinking the 
nature of the business and the nature of the organization.
Paradigm shifts and business process redesign often fail because extensive 
organizational change is so difficult to orchestrate (see Chapter 14). Why, 
then, do so many corporations contemplate such radical change? Because the 
rewards are equally high (see Figure 13.1). In many instances, firms  seeking 
 paradigm shifts and pursuing reengineering strategies achieve stunning, 
order-of- magnitude increases in their returns on investment (or productiv-
ity). Some of these success stories, and some failure stories, are included 
throughout this book.
BUSINESS PROCESS REDESIGN
Like Moen, described in the chapter-opening case, many businesses today 
are trying to use information technology to improve their business processes. 
Some of these systems entail incremental process change, but others require 
more far-reaching redesign of business processes. To deal with these changes, 
organizations are turning to business process management. Business  process 
management (BPM) provides a variety of tools and methodologies to analyze 
existing processes, design new processes, and optimize those processes. BPM 
is never concluded because process improvement requires continual change. 
Companies practicing business process management go through the following 
steps:
1. Identify processes for change: One of the most important strategic 
 decisions that a firm can make is not deciding how to use computers to 
improve business processes, but understanding what business processes 
need improvement. When systems are used to strengthen the wrong 
 business model or business processes, the business can become more 
 efficient at doing what it should not do. As a result, the firm becomes 
 vulnerable to  com petitors who may have discovered the right business 
 
Chapter 13 Building Information Systems 
537

model. Considerable time and cost may also be spent improving business 
processes that have little impact on overall firm performance and revenue. 
Managers need to determine what business processes are the most important 
and how improving these processes will help business performance.
2. Analyze existing processes: Existing business processes should be 
 modeled and documented, noting inputs, outputs, resources, and the 
sequence of activities. The process design team identifies redundant steps, 
paper-intensive tasks, bottlenecks, and other inefficiencies.
Figure 13.2 illustrates the “as-is” process for purchasing a book from a 
 physical bookstore. Consider what happens when a customer visits a physical 
bookstore and searches its shelves for a book. If he or she finds the book, that 
person takes it to the checkout counter and pays for it via credit card, cash, or 
check. If the customer is unable to locate the book, he or she must ask a book-
store clerk to search the shelves or check the bookstore’s inventory records to 
see if it is in stock. If the clerk finds the book, the customer purchases it and 
leaves. If the book is not available locally, the clerk inquires about ordering it 
for the customer, from the bookstore’s warehouse or from the book’s distribu-
tor or publisher. Once the ordered book arrives at the bookstore, a bookstore 
employee telephones the customer with this information. The customer would 
have to go to the bookstore again to pick up the book and pay for it. If the book-
store is unable to order the book for the customer, the customer would have to 
try another bookstore. You can see that this process has many steps and might 
require the customer to make multiple trips to the bookstore.
3. Design the new process: Once the existing process is mapped and 
 measured in terms of time and cost, the process design team will try to 
improve the process by designing a new one. A new streamlined “to-be” 
process will be documented and modeled for comparison with the old 
process.
 FIGURE 13.2  AS-IS BUSINESS PROCESS FOR PURCHASING A BOOK FROM A PHYSICAL BOOKSTORE
Purchasing a book from a physical bookstore requires many steps to be performed by both the seller and the customer.
538 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

Figure 13.3 illustrates how the book-purchasing process can be redesigned by 
taking advantage of the Internet. The customer accesses an online  bookstore 
over the Internet from his or her computer. He or she searches the bookstore’s 
online catalog for the book he or she wants. If the book is available, the  customer 
orders the book online, supplying credit card and shipping address information, 
and the book is delivered to the customer’s home. If the online bookstore does 
not carry the book, the customer selects another online bookstore and searches 
for the book again. This process has far fewer steps than that for purchasing 
the book in a physical bookstore, requires much less effort on the part of the 
customer, and requires less sales staff for customer service. The new process is 
therefore much more efficient and time-saving.
The new process design needs to be justified by showing how much it 
reduces time and cost or enhances customer service and value. Management 
first measures the time and cost of the existing process as a baseline. In our 
example, the time required for purchasing a book from a physical bookstore 
might range from 15 minutes (if the customer immediately finds what he or 
she wants) to 30 minutes if the book is in stock but has to be located by sales 
staff. If the book has to be ordered from another source, the process might 
take one or two weeks and another trip to the bookstore for the  customer. 
If the customer lives far away from the bookstore, the time to travel to the 
 bookstore would have to be factored in. The bookstore will have to pay the 
costs for maintaining a physical store and keeping the book in stock, for 
sales staff on site, and for shipment costs if the book has to be obtained from 
another location.
The new process for purchasing a book online might only take several 
minutes, although the customer might have to wait several days or a week to 
receive the book in the mail and will have to pay a shipping charge. But the 
customer saves time and money by not having to travel to the bookstore or 
make additional visits to pick up the book. Booksellers’ costs are lower 
because they do not have to pay for a physical store location or for local 
inventory.
4. Implement the new process: Once the new process has been thoroughly 
modeled and analyzed, it must be translated into a new set of procedures and 
work rules. New information systems or enhancements to existing systems 
 FIGURE 13.3  REDESIGNED PROCESS FOR PURCHASING A BOOK ONLINE
Using Internet technology makes it possible to redesign the process for purchasing a book so that it requires fewer steps and 
consumes fewer resources.
 
Chapter 13 Building Information Systems 
539

may have to be implemented to support the redesigned process. The new 
process and supporting systems are rolled out into the business organiza-
tion. As the business starts using this process, problems are  uncovered 
and addressed. Employees working with the process may recommend 
improvements.
5. Continuous measurement: Once a process has been implemented 
and optimized, it needs to be continually measured. Why? Processes may 
 deteriorate over time as employees fall back on old methods, or they may 
lose their effectiveness if the business experiences other changes.
Although many business process improvements are incremental and 
 ongoing, there are occasions when more radical change must take place. Our 
example of a physical bookstore redesigning the book-purchasing process so 
that it can be carried out online is an example of this type of radical, far-reach-
ing change. When properly implemented, business process redesign produces 
dramatic gains in productivity and efficiency, and may even change the way 
the business is run. In some instances, it drives a “paradigm shift” that 
 transforms the nature of the business itself.
This actually happened in book retailing when Amazon challenged  traditional 
physical bookstores with its online retail model. By radically rethinking the 
way a book can be purchased and sold, Amazon and other online bookstores 
have achieved remarkable efficiencies, cost reductions, and a whole new way 
of doing business.
BPM poses challenges. Executives report that the largest single barrier to 
 successful business process change is organizational culture. Employees do not 
like unfamiliar routines and often try to resist change. This is especially true of 
projects where organizational changes are very ambitious and far-reaching. 
Managing change is neither simple nor intuitive, and companies committed to 
extensive process improvement need a good change management strategy (see 
Chapter 14).
Tools for Business Process Management
Over 100 software firms provide tools for various aspects of BPM, including IBM, 
Oracle, and TIBCO. These tools help businesses identify and document  processes 
requiring improvement, create models of improved processes,  capture and 
enforce business rules for performing processes, and integrate  existing systems 
to support new or redesigned processes. BPM software tools also provide analyt-
ics for verifying that process performance has been improved and for measuring 
the impact of process changes on key business performance indicators.
Some BPM tools document and monitor business processes to help firms 
identify inefficiencies, using software to connect with each of the systems a 
company uses for a particular process to identify trouble spots. Another cat-
egory of tools automate some parts of a business process and enforce business 
rules so that employees perform that process more  consistently and efficiently.
For example, American National Insurance Company (ANCO), which offers 
life insurance, medical insurance, property casualty insurance, and invest-
ment services, used Pega BPM workflow software to streamline customer 
 service  processes across four business groups. The software built rules to guide 
 customer service representatives through a single view of a customer’s informa-
tion that was maintained in multiple systems. By eliminating the need to juggle 
multiple applications simultaneously to handle customer and agent requests, 
the improved process increased customer service representative workload 
capacity by 192 percent.
540 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

A third category of tools helps businesses integrate their existing systems to 
support process improvements. They automatically manage processes across 
the business, extract data from various sources and databases, and  generate 
transactions in multiple related systems (see the Interactive Session on 
Organizations).
13.2 WHAT ARE THE CORE ACTIVITIES IN THE 
SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS?
New information systems are an outgrowth of a process of organizational 
problem solving. A new information system is built as a solution to some 
type of problem or set of problems the organization perceives it is facing.
The problem may be one in which managers and employees realize that the 
organization is not performing as well as expected, or that the organization 
should take advantage of new opportunities to perform more successfully.
The activities that go into producing an information system solution to 
an organizational problem or opportunity are called systems development. 
Systems development is a structured kind of problem solved with distinct 
 activities. These activities consist of systems analysis, systems design, program-
ming, testing, conversion, and production and maintenance.
Figure 13.4 illustrates the systems development process. The systems 
development activities depicted usually take place in sequential order.
But some of the activities may need to be repeated or some may take place 
simultaneously, depending on the approach to system building that is being 
employed (see Section 13.4).
SYSTEMS ANALYSIS
Systems analysis is the analysis of a problem that a firm tries to solve with an 
information system. It consists of defining the problem, identifying its causes, 
 FIGURE 13.4 THE SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
Building a system can be broken down into six core activities.

When we hear “snowboarding”, we tend to think 
of snow-covered slopes, acrobatic jumps, and 
high-flying entertainment. We don’t usually think 
of improving business process efficiency. But 
 snowboarding is business for Burton Snowboards, 
an industry pioneer and market leader. Founded in 
1977 by Jake Burton Carpenter and headquartered 
in Burlington, Vermont, Burton designs, manu-
factures, and markets equipment, clothing, and 
related accessories for snowboarders. Today, Burton 
is a global enterprise that serves customers in 27 
 countries and has offices in Japan, Austria, and 
throughout the United States. 
At its peak, Burton controlled over 40 percent 
of the U.S. snowboarding market, and it remains 
the market leader amidst a growing number of 
 competitors. Now, as Burton continues to expand 
into a global company, it has a new set of prob-
lems: improving its systems for inventory, supply 
chain, purchasing, and customer service. 
Stocking and managing inventory is a difficult 
problem for Burton, whose inventory changes dra-
matically depend on product line updates and the 
time of the year. Burton takes feedback from its 
customers very seriously, and will move quickly 
to meet their needs. For instance, if a rider tests 
a jacket and recommends repositioning a zipper, 
Burton’s production line must be able to make this 
modification quickly and easily. Being dynamic 
and adaptable is a competitive necessity. 
Burton has implemented and currently main-
tains SAP enterprise software, an Oracle data-
base, a SUSE Linux enterprise server, and com-
modity  hardware. That’s a long way from a lone 
 woodworking shop in Vermont. Before making 
these upgrades, Burton’s information systems 
were a hodgepodge of inconsistently implemented 
and underutilized software. The company had 
to  manually allocate products to customers and 
orders. In 1997, Burton first deployed SAP to begin 
upgrading its IT landscape, and the company has 
continued to use SAP since that time. But Burton 
needed to do more with its systems.
Two of Burton’s IT goals, established by CIO 
Kevin Ubert, are to “strengthen the foundation,” 
and keep their systems “simple, standard, [and] 
supportable.” The foundation Ubert referred to is 
SAP enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. 
Rather than buying new software to solve IT prob-
lems, Burton decided that it would explore basic 
functionalities of SAP ERP software that it had not 
used yet. Often, Burton could resolve problems this 
way without adding new layers of complexity to its 
IT infrastructure, and the company gained profi-
ciency with SAP enterprise software in the process. 
Burton aims for a standard, traditional version of 
software whenever possible, realizing that with 
more bells and whistles comes increased mainte-
nance costs and steeper learning curves to under-
standing the software.
SAP analysts helped Burton identify the top 
five transactions that were the most critical to its 
business operations and that needed optimization 
from a systems standpoint. Burton had to  identify 
unnecessarily complicated processes, back-
logs, and design gaps in the flow of its business 
 processes. For example, the available-to-promise 
process was taking hours to complete. (Available 
to promise, in response to customer order inqui-
ries, reports on available quantities of a requested 
product and delivery due dates.) Burton wanted to 
speed up this process so that its dealers and retail 
customers would have more precise information 
about the availability of products not currently 
in stock. Completing this process now takes 20 
 minutes.
Other processes in need of improvement 
included the order-to-cash process (receiving 
and processing customer sales, including order 
entry, fulfillment, distribution, and payment); 
the  handling of overdue purchase orders in the 
procure-to-pay process, which consists of all the 
steps from purchasing goods from a supplier to 
paying the supplier; and the electronic data inter-
change (EDI) inventory feed extract transaction. 
Burton has an assortment of warehouses that pass 
inventory data to one another automatically using 
EDI systems. Thousands of items are moving from 
warehouse to warehouse and thousands of transac-
tions occur each day at each warehouse. Burton 
found that the process of reporting inventory was 
inefficient, and both suppliers and customers 
could not  easily determine up-to-date information 
on which items were in stock at which warehouse.

SAP and Burton worked together to improve 
 communication between warehouses and supply 
chain efficiency.
A management dashboard developed with the 
help of SAP shows how smoothly a critical process 
is running at a certain point in time. Information 
from the dashboard helps Burton’s key users 
 discover inconsistencies, gaps, or other areas that 
they should be monitoring more closely.
All of these process improvements proved 
especially valuable during what Burton calls its 
“reorder” season. Burton’s dealers place orders

for the potential growth in global sales that would 
develop as a result of Beijing winning the rights

that China might account for a full 10 percent of its 
sales by that time.

specifying the solution, and identifying the information requirements that 
must be met by a system solution.
The systems analyst creates a road map of the existing organization and 
 systems, identifying the primary owners and users of data along with  existing 
hardware and software. The systems analyst then details the problems of 
 existing systems. By examining documents, work papers, and procedures, 
observing system operations, and interviewing key users of the systems, the 
analyst can identify the problem areas and objectives a solution would achieve. 
Often, the solution requires building a new information system or improving 
an existing one.
The systems analysis also includes a feasibility study to determine 
whether that solution is feasible, or achievable, from a financial, technical, 
and  organizational standpoint. The feasibility study determines whether the 
proposed system is expected to be a good investment, whether the technology 
needed for the system is available and can be handled by the firm’s informa-
tion systems specialists, and whether the organization can handle the changes 
introduced by the system.
 
Chapter 13 Building Information Systems 
543

Normally, the systems analysis process identifies several alternative 
 solutions that the organization can pursue and assess the feasibility of each. 
A written systems proposal report describes the costs and benefits, and the 
advantages and disadvantages, of each alternative. It is up to management to 
determine which mix of costs, benefits, technical features, and organizational 
impacts  represents the most desirable alternative.
Establishing Information Requirements
Perhaps the most challenging task of the systems analyst is to define the specific 
information requirements that must be met by the chosen system solution. At the 
most basic level, the information requirements of a new system involve identi-
fying who needs what information, where, when, and how. Requirements analy-
sis carefully defines the objectives of the new or modified system and develops 
a detailed description of the functions that the new system must perform. Faulty 
requirements analysis is a leading cause of systems failure and high  systems 
development costs (see Chapter 14). A system designed around the wrong set 
of requirements will either have to be discarded because of poor performance 
or will need to undergo major modifications. Section 13.3 describes alternative 
approaches to eliciting requirements that help minimize this problem.
Some problems do not require an information system solution but instead 
need an adjustment in management, additional training, or refinement of 
 existing organizational procedures. If the problem is information related, 
 systems analysis still may be required to diagnose the problem and arrive at the 
proper solution.
SYSTEMS DESIGN
Systems analysis describes what a system should do to meet information 
requirements, and systems design shows how the system will fulfill this 
 objective. The design of an information system is the overall plan or model 
for that system. Like the blueprint of a building or house, it consists of all the 
 specifications that give the system its form and structure.
The systems designer details the system specifications that will deliver 
the functions identified during systems analysis. These specifications should 
address all of the managerial, organizational, and technological components of 
the system solution. Table 13.1 lists the types of specifications that would be 
produced during systems design.
Like houses or buildings, information systems may have many possible 
designs. Each design represents a unique blend of all technical and organi-
zational components. What makes one design superior to others is the ease 
and efficiency with which it fulfills user requirements within a specific set of 
 technical, organizational, financial, and time constraints.
The Role of End Users
User information requirements drive the entire system-building effort. Users 
must have sufficient control over the design process to ensure that the system 
reflects their business priorities and information needs, not the biases of the 
technical staff. Working on design increases users’ understanding and accep-
tance of the system. As we describe in Chapter 14, insufficient user involve-
ment in the design effort is a major cause of system failure. However, some 
systems require more user participation in design than others, and Section 13.3 
shows how alternative systems development methods address the user partici-
pation issue.
544 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

COMPLETING THE SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
The remaining steps in the systems development process translate the  solution 
specifications established during systems analysis and design into a fully 
 operational information system. These concluding steps consist of program-
ming, testing, conversion, production, and maintenance.
Programming
During the programming stage, system specifications that were prepared 
during the design stage are translated into software program code. Today, many 
organizations no longer do their own programming for new systems. Instead, 
they purchase the software that meets the requirements for a new system from 
external sources such as software packages from a commercial software vendor, 
software services from an application service provider, or outsourcing firms 
that develop custom application software for their clients (see Section 13.3).
Testing
Exhaustive and thorough testing must be conducted to ascertain whether the 
system produces the right results. Testing answers the question, “Will the system 
produce the desired results under known conditions?” As Chapter 5 noted, some 
companies are starting to use cloud computing services for this work.
The amount of time needed to answer this question has been tradition-
ally underrated in systems project planning (see Chapter 14). Testing is time- 
consuming: Test data must be carefully prepared, results reviewed, and correc-
tions made in the system. In some instances, parts of the system may have to 
be redesigned. The risks resulting from glossing over this step are enormous.
Testing an information system can be broken down into three types of 
 activities: unit testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Unit testing, or 
program  testing, consists of testing each program separately in the system. It is 
widely believed that the purpose of such testing is to guarantee that programs

are error-free, but this goal is realistically impossible. Testing should be viewed 
instead as a means of locating errors in programs, focusing on finding all the ways 
to make a program fail. Once they are pinpointed, problems can be corrected.
System testing tests the functioning of the information system as a whole. It 
tries to determine whether discrete modules will function together as planned 
and whether discrepancies exist between the way the system actually works 
and the way it was conceived. Among the areas examined are performance 
time, capacity for file storage and handling peak loads, recovery and restart 
capabilities, and manual procedures.
Acceptance testing provides the final certification that the system is ready 
to be used in a production setting. Systems tests are evaluated by users and 
reviewed by management. When all parties are satisfied that the new system 
meets their standards, the system is formally accepted for installation.
The systems development team works with users to devise a systematic test 
plan. The test plan includes all of the preparations for the series of tests we 
have just described.
Figure 13.5 shows an example of a test plan. The general condition being 
tested is a record change. The documentation consists of a series of test plan 
screens maintained on a database (perhaps a PC database) that is ideally suited 
to this kind of application.
Conversion is the process of changing from the old system to the new system. 
Four main conversion strategies can be employed: the parallel strategy, the direct 
cutover strategy, the pilot study strategy, and the phased approach strategy.
In a parallel strategy, both the old system and its potential replacement 
are run together for a time until everyone is assured that the new one func-
tions correctly. This is the safest conversion approach because, in the event of 
errors or processing disruptions, the old system can still be used as a backup. 
However, this approach is very expensive, and additional staff or resources may 
be required to run the extra system.
The direct cutover strategy replaces the old system entirely with the new 
system on an appointed day. It is a very risky approach that can potentially be 
 FIGURE 13.5 A SAMPLE TEST PLAN TO TEST A RECORD CHANGE
When developing a test plan, it is imperative to include the various conditions to be tested, the 
requirements for each condition tested, and the expected results. Test plans require input from both 
end users and information systems specialists.
546 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

more costly than running two systems in parallel if serious problems with the 
new system are found. There is no other system to fall back on. Dislocations, 
disruptions, and the cost of corrections may be enormous.
The pilot study strategy introduces the new system to only a limited area 
of the organization, such as a single department or operating unit. When this 
pilot version is complete and working smoothly, it is installed throughout the 
rest of the organization, either simultaneously or in stages.
The phased approach strategy introduces the new system in stages, either 
by functions or by organizational units. If, for example, the system is introduced 
by function, a new payroll system might begin with hourly workers who are 
paid weekly, followed six months later by adding salaried employees (who are 
paid monthly) to the system. If the system is introduced by organizational unit, 
 corporate headquarters might be converted first, followed by outlying operating 
units four months later.
Moving from an old system to a new one requires that end users be trained to 
use the new system. Detailed documentation showing how the system works 
from both a technical and end-user standpoint is finalized during conversion 
time for use in training and everyday operations. Lack of proper training and 
documentation contributes to system failure, so this portion of the systems 
development process is very important.
Production and Maintenance
After the new system is installed and conversion is complete, the system 
is said to be in production. During this stage, the system will be reviewed 
by both users and technical specialists to determine how well it has met its 
 original objectives and to decide whether any revisions or modifications are in 
order. In some instances, a formal post-implementation audit document is 
 prepared. After the system has been fine-tuned, it must be maintained while 
it is in  production to correct errors, meet requirements, or improve process-
ing efficiency. Changes in hardware, software, documentation, or procedures 
to a production system to correct errors, meet new requirements, or improve 
 processing efficiency are termed maintenance.
Approximately 20 percent of the time devoted to maintenance is used for 
debugging or correcting emergency production problems. Another 20 percent 
is concerned with changes in data, files, reports, hardware, or system software. 
But 60 percent of all maintenance work consists of making user enhance-
ments, improving documentation, and recoding system components for greater 
 processing efficiency. The amount of work in the third category of maintenance 
problems could be reduced significantly through better systems analysis and 
design practices. Table 13.2 summarizes the systems development activities.
13.3 WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL METHODOLOGIES FOR 
MODELING AND DESIGNING SYSTEMS?
There are alternative methodologies for modeling and designing systems. 
Structured methodologies and object-oriented development are the most 
prominent.
STRUCTURED METHODOLOGIES
Structured methodologies have been used to document, analyze, and design 
information systems since the 1970s. Structured refers to the fact that
 
Chapter 13 Building Information Systems 
547

the techniques are step by step, with each step building on the previous 
one. Structured methodologies are top-down, progressing from the highest,
most abstract level to the lowest level of detail—from the general to the specific.
Structured development methods are process-oriented, focusing primar-
ily on modeling the processes, or actions that capture, store, manipulate, and 
 distribute data as the data flow through a system. These methods separate data 
from processes. A separate programming procedure must be written every time 
someone wants to take an action on a particular piece of data. The procedures 
act on data that the program passes to them.
The primary tool for representing a system’s component processes and the 
flow of data between them is the data flow diagram (DFD). The data flow 
 diagram offers a logical graphic model of information flow, partitioning a system 
into modules that show manageable levels of detail. It rigorously  specifies the 
processes or transformations that occur within each module and the interfaces 
that exist between them.
Figure 13.6 shows a simple data flow diagram for a mail-in university course 
registration system. The rounded boxes represent processes, which portray the 
transformation of data. The square box represents an external entity, which 
is an originator or receiver of information located outside the boundaries of 
the system being modeled. The open rectangles represent data stores, which 
are either manual or automated inventories of data. The arrows represent data 
flows, which show the movement between processes, external entities, and 
data stores. They contain packets of data with the name or content of each data 
flow listed beside the arrow.
This data flow diagram shows that students submit registration forms with 
their name, identification number, and the numbers of the courses they wish to 
take. In process 1.0, the system verifies that each course selected is still open 
by referencing the university’s course file. The file distinguishes courses that 
are open from those that have been canceled or filled. Process 1.0 then deter-
mines which of the student’s selections can be accepted or rejected. Process 
2.0 enrolls the student in the courses for which he or she has been accepted.
It updates the university’s course file with the student’s name and identification

number and recalculates the class size. If maximum enrollment has been 
reached, the course number is flagged as closed. Process 2.0 also updates 
the university’s student master file with information about new students or 
changes in address. Process 3.0 then sends each student applicant a confirma-
tion of  registration letter listing the courses for which he or she is registered 
and noting the course selections that could not be fulfilled.
The diagrams can be used to depict higher-level processes as well as lower-
level details. Through leveled data flow diagrams, a complex process can be 
broken down into successive levels of detail. An entire system can be divided 
into subsystems with a high-level data flow diagram. Each subsystem, in turn, 
can be divided into additional subsystems with second-level data flow diagrams, 
and the lower-level subsystems can be broken down again until the lowest level 
of detail has been reached.
Another tool for structured analysis is a data dictionary, which contains 
information about individual pieces of data and data groupings within a system 
(see Chapter 6). The data dictionary defines the contents of data flows and data 
stores so that systems builders understand exactly what pieces of data they con-
tain. Process specifications describe the transformation occurring within the 
lowest level of the data flow diagrams. They express the logic for each process.
In structured methodology, software design is modeled using hierarchical 
structure charts. The structure chart is a top-down chart, showing each level 
of design, its relationship to other levels, and its place in the overall design 
structure. The design first considers the main function of a program or system, 
then breaks this function into subfunctions, and decomposes each subfunction 
until the lowest level of detail has been reached. Figure 13.7 shows a high-level 
structure chart for a payroll system. If a design has too many levels to fit onto 
one structure chart, it can be broken down further on more detailed structure 
charts. A structure chart may document one program, one system (a set of 
 programs), or part of one program.
 FIGURE 13.6 DATA FLOW DIAGRAM FOR MAIL-IN UNIVERSITY 
REGISTRATION SYSTEM
The system has three processes: Verify availability (1.0), Enroll student (2.0), and Confirm registration (3.0). 
The name and content of each of the data flows appear adjacent to each arrow. There is one external 
entity in this system: the student. There are two data stores: the student master file and the course file.
 
Chapter 13 Building Information Systems 
549

OBJECT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT
Structured methods are useful for modeling processes, but do not handle the 
modeling of data well. They also treat data and processes as logically separate 
entities, whereas in the real world such separation seems unnatural. Different 
modeling conventions are used for analysis (the data flow diagram) and for 
design (the structure chart).
Object-oriented development addresses these issues. Object-oriented 
development uses the object as the basic unit of systems analysis and design. 
An object combines data and the specific processes that operate on those data. 
Data encapsulated in an object can be accessed and modified only by the 
 operations, or methods, associated with that object. Instead of passing data to 
procedures, programs send a message for an object to perform an operation that 
is already embedded in it. The system is modeled as a collection of objects and 
the relationships among them. Because processing logic resides within objects 
rather than in separate software programs, objects must collaborate with each 
other to make the system work.
Object-oriented modeling is based on the concepts of class and inheritance. 
Objects belonging to a certain class, or general categories of similar objects, 
have the features of that class. Classes of objects in turn can inherit all the 
structure and behaviors of a more general class and then add variables and 
behaviors unique to each object. New classes of objects are created by  choosing 
an existing class and specifying how the new class differs from the existing 
class, instead of starting from scratch each time.
We can see how class and inheritance work in Figure 13.8, which illustrates 
the relationships among classes concerning employees and how they are paid. 
Employee is the common ancestor, or superclass, for the other three classes. 
Salaried, Hourly, and Temporary are subclasses of Employee. The class name is 
in the top compartment, the attributes for each class are in the middle  portion 
of each box, and the list of operations is in the bottom portion of each box.
The features that are shared by all employees (ID, name, address, date hired, 
position, and pay) are stored in the Employee superclass, whereas each subclass 
stores features that are specific to that particular type of employee. Specific to 
hourly employees, for example, are their hourly rates and overtime rates. A 
solid line from the subclass to the superclass is a generalization path showing 
that the subclasses Salaried, Hourly, and Temporary have common features 
that can be generalized into the superclass Employee.
 FIGURE 13.7 HIGH-LEVEL STRUCTURE CHART FOR A PAYROLL SYSTEM
This structure chart shows the highest or most abstract level of design for a payroll system, providing an overview of the 
entire system.
550 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

Object-oriented development is more iterative and incremental than 
 traditional structured development. During analysis, systems builders docu-
ment the functional requirements of the system, specifying its most impor-
tant  properties and what the proposed system must do. Interactions between 
the system and its users are analyzed to identify objects, which include both 
data and processes. The object-oriented design phase describes how the objects 
will behave and how they will interact with one another. Similar objects are 
grouped together to form a class, and classes are grouped into hierarchies in 
which a subclass inherits the attributes and methods from its superclass.
The information system is implemented by translating the design into 
 program code, reusing classes that are already available in a library of 
 reusable software objects, and adding new ones created during the object-
oriented design phase. Implementation may also involve the creation of an 
object-oriented database. The resulting system must be thoroughly tested and 
evaluated.
Because objects are reusable, object-oriented development could  potentially 
reduce the time and cost of writing software because organizations can reuse 
software objects that have already been created as building blocks for other 
applications. New systems can be created by using some existing objects, 
changing others, and adding a few new objects. Object-oriented frameworks 
have been developed to provide reusable, semicomplete applications that the 
organization can further customize into finished applications.
COMPUTER-AIDED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
Computer-aided software engineering (CASE)—sometimes called 
 computer-aided systems engineering—provides software tools to automate 
the methodologies we have just described to reduce the amount of repeti-
tive work the developer needs to do. CASE tools also facilitate the creation of 
clear  documentation and the coordination of team development efforts. Team

Chapter 13 Building Information Systems 
551

 members can share their work easily by accessing each other’s files to review or 
modify what has been done. Modest productivity benefits can also be achieved 
if the tools are used properly.
CASE tools provide automated graphics facilities for producing charts and 
diagrams, screen and report generators, data dictionaries, extensive report-
ing facilities, analysis and checking tools, code generators, and documen-
tation  generators. In general, CASE tools try to increase productivity and 
 quality by:
• Enforcing a standard development methodology and design discipline
• Improving communication between users and technical specialists
• Organizing and correlating design components and providing rapid access to 
them using a design repository
• Automating tedious and error-prone portions of analysis and design
• Automating code generation and testing and control rollout
CASE tools contain features for validating design diagrams and specifica-
tions. CASE tools thus support iterative design by automating revisions and 
changes and providing prototyping facilities. A CASE information repository 
stores all the information defined by the analysts during the project. The reposi-
tory includes data flow diagrams, structure charts, entity-relationship diagrams, 
data definitions, process specifications, screen and report formats, notes and 
 comments, and test results.
To be used effectively, CASE tools require organizational discipline. Every 
member of a development project must adhere to a common set of naming 
conventions and standards as well as to a development methodology. The best 
CASE tools enforce common methods and standards, which may discourage 
their use in situations where organizational discipline is lacking.
13.4 WHAT ARE ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR 
BUILDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS?
Systems differ in terms of their size and technological complexity and in terms 
of the organizational problems they are meant to solve. A number of systems-
building approaches have been developed to deal with these differences.
This section describes these alternative methods: the traditional systems life 
cycle, prototyping, application software packages, end-user development, and 
outsourcing.
TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS LIFE CYCLE
The systems life cycle is the oldest method for building information  systems. 
The life cycle methodology is a phased approach to building a system,  dividing 
systems development into formal stages, as illustrated in Figure 13.9. Systems 
development specialists have different opinions on how to partition the 
 systems-building stages, but they roughly correspond to the stages of systems 
development we have just described.
The systems life cycle methodology maintains a formal division of labor 
between end users and information systems specialists. Technical specialists, 
such as systems analysts and programmers, are responsible for much of the 
 systems analysis, design, and implementation work; end users are limited to 
552 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

providing information requirements and reviewing the technical staff’s work. 
The life cycle also emphasizes formal specifications and paperwork, so many 
documents are generated during the course of a systems project.
The systems life cycle is still used for building large complex  systems 
that require a rigorous and formal requirements analysis, predefined 
 specifications, and tight controls over the system-building process. However, 
the systems life cycle approach can be costly, time-consuming, and inflex-
ible. Although systems builders can go back and forth among stages in the
life cycle, the systems life cycle is predominantly a “waterfall” approach
in which tasks in one stage are completed before work for the next stage 
begins. Activities can be repeated, but volumes of new documents must
be generated and steps retraced if requirements and specifications need
to be revised. This encourages freezing of specifications relatively early
in the development process. The life cycle approach is also not suitable
for many small desktop systems, which tend to be less structured and more 
individualized.
PROTOTYPING
Prototyping consists of building an experimental system rapidly and inexpen-
sively for end users to evaluate. By interacting with the prototype, users can get 
a better idea of their information requirements. The prototype endorsed by the 
users can be used as a template to create the final system.
The prototype is a working version of an information system or part of the 
system, but it is meant to be only a preliminary model. Once operational, the 
prototype will be further refined until it conforms precisely to users’ require-
ments. Once the design has been finalized, the prototype can be converted to a 
polished production system.
 FIGURE 13.9 THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
The systems development life cycle partitions systems development into formal stages, with each stage 
requiring completion before the next stage can begin.
 
Chapter 13 Building Information Systems 
553

The process of building a preliminary design, trying it out, refining it, and 
trying again has been called an iterative process of systems development 
because the steps required to build a system can be repeated over and over 
again. Prototyping is more explicitly iterative than the conventional life cycle, 
and it actively promotes system design changes. It has been said that prototyp-
ing replaces unplanned rework with planned iteration, with each version more 
accurately reflecting users’ requirements.
Steps in Prototyping
Figure 13.10 shows a four-step model of the prototyping process, which consists 
of the following:
Step 1:  Identify the user’s basic requirements. The systems designer (usually an 
 information systems specialist) works with the user only long enough to 
capture the user’s basic information needs.
Step 2:  Develop an initial prototype. The systems designer creates a working 
 prototype quickly, using tools for rapidly generating software.
Step 3:  Use the prototype. The user is encouraged to work with the system to 
 determine how well the prototype meets his or her needs and to make 
suggestions for improving the prototype.
Step 4:  Revise and enhance the prototype. The system builder notes all changes the 
user requests and refines the prototype accordingly. After the prototype 
has been revised, the cycle returns to Step 3. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated 
until the user is satisfied.
 FIGURE 13.10 THE PROTOTYPING PROCESS
The process of developing a prototype can be broken down into four steps. Because a prototype can 
be developed quickly and inexpensively, systems builders can go through several iterations, repeating 
steps 3 and 4, to refine and enhance the prototype before arriving at the final operational one.
554 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

When no more iterations are required, the approved prototype then becomes 
an operational prototype that furnishes the final specifications for the applica-
tion. Sometimes the prototype is adopted as the production version of the system.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Prototyping
Prototyping is most useful when there is some uncertainty about require-
ments or design solutions and often used for designing an information system’s
end-user interface (the part of the system with which end users interact, such as 
online display and data entry screens, reports, or Web pages). Because prototyp-
ing encourages intense end-user involvement throughout the systems develop-
ment life cycle, it is more likely to produce systems that fulfill user requirements.
However, rapid prototyping can gloss over essential steps in systems develop-
ment. If the completed prototype works reasonably well, management may not 
see the need for reprogramming, redesign, or full documentation and testing to 
build a polished production system. Some of these hastily constructed systems 
may not easily accommodate large quantities of data or a large number of users 
in a production environment.
END-USER DEVELOPMENT
End-user development allows end users, with little or no formal assistance 
from technical specialists, to create simple information systems, reducing the 
time and steps required to produce a finished application. Using user-friendly 
query languages and reporting, Web site development, graphics, and PC 
 software tools, end users can access data, create reports, and develop simple 
applications on their own, with little or no help from professional systems 
 analysts or programmers. A query language is a software tool that provides 
immediate online answers to questions that are not predefined, such as “Who 
are the highest-performing sales representatives?” Query languages are often 
tied to data management software (see Chapter 6).
For example, Neways Enterprise, a multinational firm which designs, 
 manufactures, and sells personal care, household and nutritional products 
that are free of harmful ingredients, used Information Builders WEBFOCUS to 
create an online self-service reporting system for its thousands of independent 
distributors and its business analysts. The business analysts use the self-ser-
vice reports to monitor finances, anticipate trends, and predict results based 
on current insights. Neways’ globally dispersed independent distributors use 
the system to access real-time production data to support sales efforts and track 
qualification for monthly bonuses. The system’s reporting tools let them decide 
how deeply they want to drill into the data (Information Builders, 2014).
On the whole, end-user-developed systems can be completed more rapidly 
than those developed through the conventional systems life cycle. Allowing 
users to specify their own business needs improves requirements gathering 
and often leads to a higher level of user involvement and satisfaction with the 
system. However, end-user software tools still cannot replace conventional 
tools for some business applications because they cannot easily handle the 
 processing of large numbers of transactions or applications with extensive 
 procedural logic and updating requirements.
End-user computing also poses organizational risks because it occurs  outside 
of traditional mechanisms for information systems management and control. 
When systems are created rapidly, without a formal development methodol-
ogy, testing and documentation may be inadequate. Control over data can be 
lost in systems outside the traditional information systems department. To help 
 
Chapter 13 Building Information Systems

organizations maximize the benefits of end-user applications development, 
 management should control the development of end-user applications by requir-
ing cost  justification of end-user information system projects and by establishing 
hardware, software, and quality standards for user-developed applications.
APPLICATION SOFTWARE PACKAGES AND 
OUTSOURCING
Chapter 5 points out that much of today’s software is not developed in-house 
but is purchased from external sources. Firms can rent the software from a 
software service provider, they can purchase a software package from a com-
mercial vendor, or they can have a custom application developed by an outside 
outsourcing firm.
Application Software Packages
During the past several decades, many systems have been built on an  application 
software package foundation. Many applications are common to all  business 
organizations—for example, payroll, accounts receivable, general ledger, or 
inventory control. For such universal functions with standard processes that do 
not change a great deal over time, a generalized system will fulfill the require-
ments of many organizations.
If a software package can fulfill most of an organization’s requirements, the 
company does not have to write its own software. The company can save time 
and money by using the prewritten, predesigned, pretested software programs 
from the package. Package vendors supply much of the ongoing maintenance 
and support for the system, including enhancements to keep the system in line 
with ongoing technical and business developments. When a package solution is 
pursued, end users will be responsible for supplying the business information 
requirements for the system and information systems specialists will provide 
technical requirements.
If an organization has unique requirements that the package does not address, 
many packages include capabilities for customization. Customization features 
allow a software package to be modified to meet an organization’s unique require-
ments without destroying the integrity of the packaged software. If a great deal 
of customization is required, additional programming and customization work 
may become so expensive and time-consuming that they negate many of the 
advantages of software packages.
When a system is developed using an application software package, systems 
analysis will include a package evaluation effort, in which both end users and 
information systems specialists will participate. The most important evalua-
tion criteria are the functions provided by the package, flexibility, user-friendli-
ness, hardware and software resources, database requirements, installation and 
maintenance efforts, documentation, vendor quality, and cost. The package 
evaluation process often is based on a Request for Proposal (RFP), which is 
a detailed list of questions submitted to packaged-software vendors.
When a software package is selected, the organization no longer has total 
control over the systems design process. Instead of tailoring the systems design 
specifications directly to user requirements, the design effort will consist of 
trying to mold user requirements to conform to the features of the package. If 
the organization’s requirements conflict with the way the package works and 
the package cannot be customized, the organization will have to adapt to the 
package and change its procedures.
556 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

Outsourcing
If a firm does not want to use its internal resources to build or operate 
 information systems, it can outsource the work to an external organization 
that specializes in providing these services. Cloud computing and software 
as a service (SaaS) providers, which we described in Chapter 5, are one 
form of outsourcing. Subscribing companies use the software and computer 
 hardware provided by the service as the technical platform for their systems. 
In another form of outsourcing, a company could hire an external vendor 
to design and create the software for its system, but that company would 
operate the system on its own computers. The outsourcing vendor might be 
domestic or in another country.
Domestic outsourcing is driven primarily by the fact that outsourc-
ing firms possess skills, resources, and assets that their clients do not have. 
Installing a new supply chain management system in a very large company 
might require hiring an additional 30 to 50 people with specific expertise in 
supply chain management software, licensed from a vendor. Rather than hire 
 permanent new employees, most of whom would need extensive training in 
the software package, and then release them after the new system is built, it 
makes more sense, and is often less expensive, to outsource this work for a
12-month period.
In the case of offshore outsourcing, the decision tends to be much 
more cost-driven. A skilled programmer in India or Russia earns about 
USD $10,000–$20,000 per year, compared to about $60,000 per year for a 
 comparable  programmer in the United States. The Internet and low-cost com-
munications technology have drastically reduced the expense and  difficulty 
of coordinating the work of global teams in faraway locations. In addition to 
cost savings, many offshore outsourcing firms offer world-class technology 
assets and skills. Wage inflation outside the United States has recently eroded 
some of these  advantages, and some jobs have moved back to the United 
States.
Nevertheless, there is a very strong chance that at some point in your career, 
you’ll be working with offshore outsourcers or global teams. Your firm is most 
likely to benefit from outsourcing if it takes the time to evaluate all the risks 
and to make sure outsourcing is appropriate for its particular needs. Any com-
pany that outsources its applications must thoroughly understand the project, 
including its requirements, method of implementation,  anticipated benefits, 
cost components, and metrics for measuring performance.
Many firms underestimate costs for identifying and evaluating  vendors of 
information technology services, for transitioning to a new vendor, for improving 
internal software development methods to match those of  outsourcing  vendors, 
and for monitoring vendors to make sure they are fulfilling their  contractual 
obligations. Companies will need to allocate resources for  documenting require-
ments, sending out RFPs, handling travel expenses, negotiating contracts, and 
project management. Experts claim it takes from three months to a full year to 
fully transfer work to an offshore partner and make sure the vendor thoroughly 
understands your business.
Outsourcing offshore incurs additional costs for coping with cultural 
 differences that drain productivity and dealing with human resources issues, 
such as terminating or relocating domestic employees. All of these hidden costs 
undercut some of the anticipated benefits from outsourcing. Firms should be 
especially cautious when using an outsourcer to develop or to operate applica-
tions that give it some type of competitive advantage.
 
Chapter 13 Building Information Systems 
557

General Motors Corporation (GM) had outsourced 90 percent of its IT services, 
including its data centers and application development. The company recently 
decided to bring 90 percent of its IT infrastructure in-house, with only 10  percent 
managed by outsourcers. Lowering costs is important, but GM’s primary reason 
for cutting back outsourcing is to take back control of its information systems, 
which it believes were preventing the company from responding quickly to 
 competitive opportunities. Bringing information systems in-house will make it 
easier for GM to cut its sprawling list of IT applications by at least 40 percent, 
move to a more standardized platform, complete innovative IT projects more 
quickly, and get a better grip on customer and production data, which had been 
housed in too many different systems. The automaker is consolidating 23 data 
centers worldwide into just two, both in Michigan, and running four software 
development centers (Murphy, 2012).
Figure 13.11 shows best- and worst-case scenarios for the total cost of an 
 offshore outsourcing project. It shows how much hidden costs affect the total 
project cost. The best case reflects the lowest estimates for additional costs, 
and the worst case reflects the highest estimates for these costs. As you can 
see, hidden costs increase the total cost of an offshore outsourcing project by 
an extra 15 to 57 percent. Even with these extra costs, many firms will benefit 
from offshore outsourcing if they manage the work well. Under the worst-case 
scenario, a firm would still save about 15 percent.
13.5 WHAT ARE NEW APPROACHES FOR SYSTEM 
BUILDING IN THE DIGITAL FIRM ERA?
In the digital firm environment, organizations need to be able to add, 
change, and retire their technology capabilities very rapidly to respond to 
new opportunities, including the need to provide applications for mobile 
 FIGURE 13.11 TOTAL COST OF OFFSHORE OUTSOURCING
If a firm spends $10 million on offshore outsourcing contracts, that company will actually spend 
15.2 percent in extra costs even under the best-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario, where 
there is a dramatic drop in productivity along with exceptionally high transition and layoff costs, a 
firm can expect to pay up to 57 percent in extra costs on top of the $10 million outlay for an offshore 
contract.

platforms. Companies are starting to use shorter, more informal development 
processes that provide fast solutions. In addition to using software packages
and external service providers, businesses are relying more heavily on
fast-cycle techniques such as rapid application development, joint application 
design, agile development, and reusable standardized software components that 
can be assembled into a complete set of services for e-commerce and e-business.
RAPID APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT (RAD)
Object-oriented software tools, reusable software, prototyping, and fourth- 
generation language tools are helping systems builders create working systems 
much more rapidly than they could using traditional systems-building  methods 
and software tools. The term rapid application development (RAD) is used 
to describe this process of creating workable systems in a very short period
of time. RAD can include the use of visual programming and other tools for 
building graphical user interfaces, iterative prototyping of key system elements, 
the automation of program code generation, and close teamwork among end 
users and information systems specialists. Simple systems often can be assem-
bled from prebuilt components. The process does not have to be sequential, and 
key parts of development can occur simultaneously.
Sometimes a technique called joint application design (JAD) is used 
to accelerate the generation of information requirements and to develop
the initial systems design. JAD brings end users and information systems 
specialists together in an interactive session to discuss the system’s design. 
Properly prepared and facilitated, JAD sessions can significantly speed up the 
design phase and involve users at an intense level.
Agile development focuses on rapid delivery of working software by 
breaking a large project into a series of small subprojects that are completed
in short periods of time using iteration and continuous feedback. Each
mini- project is worked on by a team as if it were a complete project, including 
planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, and documentation. 
Improvement or addition of new functionality takes place within the next itera-
tion as developers clarify requirements. This helps to minimize the overall risk, 
and allows the project to adapt to changes more quickly. Agile methods empha-
size face-to-face communication over written documents, encouraging people 
to collaborate and make decisions quickly and effectively.
COMPONENT-BASED DEVELOPMENT AND WEB 
SERVICES
We have already described some of the benefits of object-oriented develop-
ment for building systems that can respond to rapidly changing business 
 environments, including Web applications. To further expedite software 
 creation, groups of objects have been assembled to provide software compo-
nents for common functions such as a graphical user interface or online order-
ing capability that can be combined to create large-scale business applications. 
This approach to software development is called component-based develop-
ment, and it enables a system to be built by assembling and integrating exist-
ing software components. Increasingly, these software components are coming 
from cloud services. Businesses are using component-based development to 
create their e-commerce applications by combining commercially available 
components for shopping carts, user authentication, search engines, and 
 catalogs with pieces of software for their own unique business requirements.
 
Chapter 13 Building Information Systems 
559

Web Services and Service-Oriented Computing
Chapter 5 introduced Web services as loosely coupled, reusable software com-
ponents delivered using Extensible Markup Language (XML) and other open 
protocols and standards that enable one application to communicate with 
another with no custom programming required to share data and services.
In addition to supporting internal and external integration of systems, Web ser-
vices can be used as tools for building new information system applications or 
enhancing existing systems. Because these software services use a universal 
set of standards, they promise to be less expensive and less difficult to weave 
together than proprietary components.
Web services can perform certain functions on their own, and they can 
also engage other Web services to complete more complex transactions, such 
as checking credit, procurement, or ordering products. By creating software 
components that can communicate and share data regardless of the operating 
system, programming language, or client device, Web services can provide sig-
nificant cost savings in systems building while opening up new opportunities 
for collaboration with other companies.
MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT: DESIGNING FOR 
A MULTI-SCREEN WORLD
Today, employees and customers expect, and even demand, to be able to use 
a mobile device of their choice to obtain information or perform a transac-
tion anywhere and at any time. To meet these needs, companies will need to 
develop mobile Web sites, mobile apps, and native apps as well as traditional 
information systems. According to digital advertising agency Vertic, mobile app 
development projects will outnumber native PC projects by a 4-to-1 ratio by 
2015 (Greengard, 2013).
Once an organization decides to develop mobile apps, it has to make some 
important choices, including the technology it will use to implement these 
apps (whether to write a native app or mobile Web app) and what to do about 
a mobile Web site. A mobile Web site is a version of a regular Web site that is 
scaled down in content and navigation for easy access and search on a small 
mobile screen. (Access Amazon’s Web site from your computer and then from 
your smartphone to see the difference from a regular Web site.)
A mobile Web app is an Internet-enabled app with specific functionality 
for mobile devices. Users access mobile Web apps through their mobile device’s 
Web browser. The Web app resides primarily on a server, is accessed via the 
Internet, and doesn’t need to be installed on the device. The same application 
can be used by most devices that can surf the Web, regardless of their brand.
A native app is a standalone application designed to run on a specific plat-
form and device. The native app is installed directly on a mobile device. Native 
apps can connect to the Internet to download and upload data, and they can 
also operate on these data even when not connected to the Internet. For exam-
ple, an e-book reading app such as Kindle software can download a book from 
the Internet, disconnect from the Internet, and present the book for reading. 
Native mobile apps provide fast performance and a high degree of reliability. 
They are also able to take advantage of a mobile device’s particular capabilities, 
such as its camera or touch features. However, native apps are expensive to 
develop because multiple versions of an app must be programmed for different 
mobile operating systems and hardware.
560 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

Developing applications for mobile platforms is quite different from devel-
opment for PCs and their much larger screens. The reduced size of mobile 
devices makes using fingers and multi-touch gestures much easier than typing 
and using keyboards. Mobile apps need to be optimized for the specific tasks 
they are to perform; they should not try to carry out too many tasks; and they 
should be designed for usability. The user experience for mobile interaction is 
fundamentally different from using a desktop or laptop PC. Saving resources—
bandwidth, screen space, memory, processing, data entry, and user gestures—
is a top priority. 
When a full Web site created for the desktop shrinks to the size of a smart-
phone screen, it is difficult for the user to navigate through the site. The user 
must continually zoom in and out and scroll to find relevant material. Therefore, 
companies need to design Web sites specifically for mobile interfaces and create 
multiple mobile sites to meet the needs of smartphones, tablets, and desktop 
browsers. This equates to at least three sites with separate content, mainte-
nance, and costs. Currently, Web sites know what device you are using because 
your browser will send this information to the server when you log on. Based 
on this information, the server will deliver the appropriate screen. 
One solution to the problem of having multiple Web sites is to use  responsive 
Web design. Responsive Web design enables Web sites to automatically change 
layouts according to the visitor’s screen resolution, whether on a desktop, 
laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Responsive design uses tools such as flexible 
 grid-based layouts, flexible images, and media queries, to optimize the design 
for different viewing contexts. This eliminates the need for separate design 
and development work for each new device. HTML5, which we introduced 
in Chapter 5, is also used for mobile application development because it can 
 support  cross-platform mobile applications.
The Interactive Session on Technology describes how some companies have 
addressed the challenges of mobile development we have just identified.

WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO GO MOBILE?
“How should we go mobile?” Almost every company 
today is asking that question. In 2014, more people 
used their mobile phones than PCs to go online, and 
there is one mobile device for every person on earth 
in 2015. The number of Web searches performed on 
mobile devices has more than quadrupled since 2010. 
Customers expect, and even demand, to be able to 
use a mobile device of their choice to obtain informa-
tion or perform a transaction anywhere and at any 
time. So if a company wants to stay connected to its 
customers, it needs some sort of mobile presence.
What do companies do, and where do they start? 
Developing mobile apps or a mobile Web site has 
some special challenges. The user experience on 
a mobile device is fundamentally different from 
that on a PC. There are special features on mobile 
devices such as location-based services that that give 
firms the potential to interact with customers in 
meaningful new ways. Firms need to be able to take 
advantage of those features while delivering an expe-
rience that is appropriate to a small screen. There 
are multiple mobile platforms to work with—iPhone, 
Android, Windows Phone, and possibly BlackBerry, 
and a firm may need a different version of an appli-
cation to run on each of these. You can’t just port a 
Web site or desktop application to a smartphone or 
tablet. It’s a different systems development process.
It’s important to understand how, why, and where 
customers use mobile devices and how these mobile 
experiences change business interactions and behav-
ior. For example, do customers who use an app 
handle a greater number of transactions on their 
own and use the phone less? Do they spend more or 
less time researching products and shopping from a 
mobile device?
Deckers Outdoor Corporation, the parent com-
pany of brands such as UGG Australia, Teva, and 
Simple Shoes, spent considerable time studying its 
customers’ mobile behavior. It looked at how cus-
tomers use their mobile devices while shopping and 
researching brands to find out how consumers would 
connect with its brand through the mobile chan-
nel. When people use mobile devices, how do they 
research the products? What information do they 
want about brand? Are they looking for information 
about product features, product reviews, or retail 
store locations?
Decker’s customer analysis showed that when 
consumers use mobile devices inside a Deckers 
store, what is most important is a seamless interac-
tion. The customer wants to be able to look at a prod-
uct on his or her mobile device and see the same 
information on that device as that person would 
obtain in the store, plus some additional information, 
such as consumer reviews.
A mobile strategy involves much more than select-
ing mobile devices, operating systems, and applica-
tions. It also involves changes to business  processes, 
changing the way people work and the way a firm 
interacts with its customers. Mobile  technology can 
streamline processes, make them more portable, 
and enhance them with capabilities such as touch 
interfaces, location and mapping features, alerts, 
texting, cameras, and video functionality. The tech-
nology can also create less efficient processes or fail 
to deliver benefits if the mobile application is not 
properly designed.
USAA, the giant financial services company serv-
ing members of the U.S. military and their families, 
is acutely aware of the need to ensure that mobile 
technology is aligned with its customer-facing busi-
ness processes and leads to genuine improvements. 
The company is using mobile technology to refine 
its business processes and provide simpler and more 
powerful ways for customers to interact with the 
company.
USAA launched its Web site in 1997 and went 
mobile ten years later, with about 90 percent of its 
interactions with customers taking place on these 
two self-service channels. In 2011, USAA handled 183 
million customer contacts through the mobile chan-
nel alone, and expects the mobile channel will be its 
primary point of contact with customers in the next 
two years. USAA has 100 dedicated mobile develop-
ers writing apps for devices using the iPhone, iPad, 
and Android operating systems, along with apps for 
the BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7.
USAA developed a smartphone accident report 
and claims app that enables customers to snap a 
photo and submit a claim directly from the site 
of an accident. The app is also able to send geo-
graphic information system (GIS) data to a towing 
service and display nearby car rental locations.

customer can capture an image of a check with

bank. The money is instantly deposited in the 
 customer’s account. This system eliminates the 
labor and expense of processing paper checks, as 
well as the time required to mail the check and 
wait three days for the deposit to clear. In 2011, 
USAA Federal Savings Bank processed $6.4 billion 
in deposits through this mobile app. 
The mobile app also displays loan and credit card 
balances, shopping services, homeowners and auto 
insurance policy information, Home Circle and 
Auto Circle buying services, retirement  products 
and information, ATM and taxi locators, and a 
 communities feature that lets users see what others 
are posting about USAA on Twitter, Facebook, and 
YouTube. 
A real estate company may want to display a 
 completely different site to mobile users who are 
looking for house information after driving by a 
“For Sale” sign. The realtor may want to optimize 
the mobile interface to include specific listing and 
 contact information to capture the lead immediately 
and keep the load time fast. If the mobile site is 
 simply a more user-friendly version of the desktop 
site, the conversions may not be as high.

builders, has a conventional Web site, but it wanted

ogy as well. The company revamped its mobile Web 
site in March 2011 to increase sales leads by helping 
potential customers with mobile phones find its loca-
tions, look at its products, register with the company, 
and call directly. Ryland’s development team made 
the site easier to read and capable of fitting on a 
smartphone or tablet screen without requiring users 
to pinch and zoom. It used jQuery Mobile software 
and responsive Web design to create variations of the 
site that were appropriate for different smartphone 
or tablet models employed by users. (The jQuery 
Mobile framework allows developers to design a 
single Web site or application that will work on all 
popular smartphone, tablet, and desktop platforms, 
eliminating the need to write unique apps for each 
mobile device or operating system.) Ryland focused 
on features such as location-based driving directions 
to nearby communities, clickable phone numbers, 
and brief online registrations to increase the chances 
of making a sale. The site shows nearby communi-
ties in order of distance, based on the location of the 
mobile device.

Review Summary
1. How does building new systems produce organizational change?
Building a new information system is a form of planned organizational change. Four kinds of 
 technology-enabled change are (a) automation, (b) rationalization of procedures, (c) business process 
redesign, and (d) paradigm shift, with far-reaching changes carrying the greatest risks and rewards. 
Many organizations are using business process management to redesign work flows and business 
 processes in the hope of achieving dramatic productivity breakthroughs. Business process manage-
ment is also useful for promoting total quality management (TQM), six sigma, and other initiatives for 
incremental process improvement.
2. What are the core activities in the systems development process?
The core activities in systems development are systems analysis, systems design, programming, 
testing, conversion, production, and maintenance. Systems analysis is the study and analysis of 
 problems of existing systems and the identification of requirements for their solutions. Systems design 
provides the specifications for an information system solution, showing how its technical and 
 organizational components fit together.
3. What are the principal methodologies for modeling and designing systems?
The two principal methodologies for modeling and designing information systems are structured 
methodologies and object-oriented development. Structured methodologies focus on modeling 
 processes and data separately. The data flow diagram is the principal tool for structured analysis, and 
the structure chart is the principal tool for representing structured software design. Object-oriented 
development models a system as a collection of objects that combine processes and data. Object- 
oriented modeling is based on the concepts of class and inheritance.
4. What are the alternative methods for building information systems?
The oldest method for building systems is the systems life cycle, which requires that information 
systems be developed in formal stages. The stages must proceed sequentially and have defined 
 outputs; each requires formal approval before the next stage can commence. The systems life cycle is 
useful for large projects that need formal specifications and tight management control over each stage 
of systems building, but it is very rigid and costly.
Prototyping consists of building an experimental system rapidly and inexpensively for end users to 
interact with and evaluate. Prototyping encourages end-user involvement in systems development 
and iteration of design until specifications are captured accurately. The rapid creation of prototypes 
can result in systems that have not been completely tested or documented or that are technically 
 inadequate for a production environment.
Using a software package reduces the amount of design, programming, testing, installation, and 
maintenance work required to build a system. Application software packages are helpful if a firm does 
not have the internal information systems staff or financial resources to custom develop a system. To 
meet an organization’s unique requirements, packages may require extensive modifications that can 
substantially raise development costs.
End-user development is the development of information systems by end users, either alone or 
with minimal assistance from information systems specialists. End-user developed systems can be 
created rapidly and informally using user-friendly software tools. However, end-user development 
may create information systems that do not necessarily meet quality assurance standards and that are 
not easily controlled by traditional means.
Outsourcing consists of using an external vendor to build (or operate) a firm’s information systems 
instead of the organization’s internal information systems staff. Outsourcing can save application 
development costs or enable firms to develop applications without an internal information systems 
staff. However, firms risk losing control over their information systems and becoming too dependent 
on external vendors. Outsourcing also entails hidden costs, especially when the work is sent offshore.
5. What are new approaches for system building in the digital firm era?
Companies are turning to rapid application design (RAD), joint application design (JAD), agile 
development, and reusable software components to accelerate the systems development process. RAD 
uses object-oriented software, visual programming, prototyping, and fourth-generation tools for very 
564 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

rapid creation of systems. Agile development breaks a large project into a series of small subprojects that are 
completed in short periods of time using iteration and continuous feedback. Component-based development 
expedites application development by grouping objects into suites of software components that can be 
 combined to create large-scale business applications. Web services provide a  common set of standards that 
enable organizations to link their systems regardless of their technology platform through standard plug-and-
play architecture. Mobile application development must pay attention to simplicity, usability, and the need 
to optimize tasks for tiny screens.

 For an additional fee, a customer purchasing from the online appliance store Appliancesdirect.com in the 
U.K., such as a washing machine, can purchase a three-year service contract. The contract provides free 
repair service and parts for the specified appliance using an authorized service provider. When a person 
with a Appliancesdirect service contract needs to repair an appliance, such as a washing machine, he or 
she calls the company’s Repairs & Parts department to schedule an appointment. The department makes 
the appointment and gives the caller the date and approximate time of the appointment. The repair tech-
nician arrives during the designated time framework and diagnoses the problem. If the problem is caused 
by a faulty part, the technician either replaces the part if he is carrying the part with him or orders the 
replacement part from Sears. If the part is not in stock, it will order the part and give the customer an 
approximate time when the part will arrive. The part is shipped directly to the customer. After the part 
has arrived, the customer must call Appliancesdirect to schedule a second appointment for a repair tech-
nician to replace the ordered part. This process is very lengthy. It may take two weeks to schedule the

13-10 
 Management at your agricultural chemicals corporation has been dissatisfied with production planning. 
Production plans are created using best guesses of demand for each product, which are based on how 
much of each product has been ordered in the past. If a customer places an unexpected order or requests 
a change to an existing order after it has been placed, there is no way to adjust production plans. The 
company may have to tell customers it can’t fill their orders, or it may run up extra costs maintaining 
additional inventory to prevent stock-outs.
At the end of each month, orders are totaled and manually keyed into the company’s production 
 planning system. Data from the past month’s production and inventory systems are manually entered 
into the firm’s order management system. Analysts from the sales department and from the produc-
tion  department analyze the data from their respective systems to determine what the sales targets and 
 production targets should be for the next month. These estimates are usually different. The analysts then 
get together at a high-level planning meeting to revise the production and sales targets to take into account 
senior management’s goals for market share, revenues, and profits. The outcome of the meeting is a  finalized 
production master schedule.
The entire production planning process takes 17 business days to complete. Nine of these days are 
required to enter and validate the data. The remaining days are spent developing and reconciling the production 
and sales targets and finalizing the production master schedule.
• Draw a diagram of the existing production planning process.
• Analyze the problems this process creates for the company.
• How could an enterprise system solve these problems? In what ways could it lower costs? Diagram 
what the production planning process might look like if the company implemented enterprise 
software.

13-11 
 This project requires you to perform a systems analysis and then design a system solution using database 
software.
Burrows Auto Dealers specializes in selling new vehicles from Toyota in Sheffield, England.  The 
company advertises in local newspapers and is listed as an authorized dealer on the Toyota Web site and 
other major Web sites for auto buyers. The company benefits from a good local word-of-mouth reputation 
and name recognition.
Burrows does not believe it has enough information about its customers. It cannot easily determine 
which prospects have made auto purchases, nor can it identify which customer touch points have produced 
the greatest number of sales leads or actual sales so it can focus advertising and marketing more on the 
channels that generate the most revenue. Are purchasers discovering Burrows from newspaper ads, from 
word of mouth, or from the Web?
Prepare a systems analysis report detailing Burrows’ problem and a system solution that can be 
implemented using PC database management software. Then use database software to develop a simple 
system solution.

SourceGas Goes for Better Workforce Scheduling Systems
CASE STUDY
S
ourceGas is a utility headquartered in Golden, 
Colorado providing natural gas service to over 
413,000 customers in Arkansas, Nebraska, 
Colorado, and Wyoming. The company has 
over 1,100 employees and operates nearly 18,000 
miles of natural gas transmission and distribution 
pipeline covering a 332,437-square-mile area—about 
half the size of Alaska. 
The number of work orders (authorizing specific 
work or repairs to be done) processed per mile 
 traveled is a key performance indicator for  utility 
companies, especially SourceGas. SourceGas’s 
 territory includes many large rural areas where 
 re-routing work orders incurs very heavy fuel, 
maintenance, and other operational costs. The 
more work orders that can be processed per mile 
traveled, the lower the cost.
SourceGas’s predecessor had installed a mobile 
information system in 2000 to dispatch approxi-
mately 500,000 work orders to approximately 500 
field technicians equipped with mobile devices. 
However, this work order and dispatch system 
was starting to show its age, and the work order 
and  dispatch processes required too much manual 
effort. All work was dispatched manually, and there 
were no systematized scheduling priorities, making 
it difficult for service technicians to consistently be 
assigned workloads that were aligned with business 
objectives. 
SourceGas dispatchers were highly experi-
enced and had the requisite knowledge to assign 
 technicians with the appropriate set of skills 
to perform the work. However, to perform this 
 process successfully, dispatchers had to commit 
to memory more than 225 different types of work 
that  technicians performed in the field. SourceGas 
wound up  spending a great deal of time and effort 
clarifying its scheduling policies.
SourceGas’s work order process starts with a call 
from a customer to the SourceGas call center in 
Fayetteville, Arkansas. Under the company’s old 
system, the company’s SAP CRM software created a 
work order that was sent to the SourceGas  dispatch 
center, where dispatchers assigned the work to 
technicians who received the assignments using 
Panasonic Toughbook mobile devices. Although the 
previous system integrated with SAP CRM software 
to enable SourceGas to track a work order from start 
to finish, the work order still had to be initiated 
manually by the dispatchers. 
What’s more, the outdated system could no 
longer be easily modified to keep up with new 
requirements. SourceGas serves both regulated 
and non-regulated markets in four states with 
568 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

different business rules, so the system has to be 
able to  accomodate rapid and constant change. 
Enhancements to the system were just too costly. 
SourceGas needed a new system to auto-
mate its work order and scheduling processes 
that could be updated and changed much more 
 easily. Management also wanted a system where 
SourceGas could make these changes using its own 
internal resources rather than external consultants, 
which the company had relied on heavily to make 
enhancements to its old system. The software for 
the legacy system had been custom-programmed by 
third-party vendors, making the system difficult to 
maintain and enhance.
In the summer of 2011, SourceGas initi-
ated a requirements-gathering workshop with 
ClickSoftware, the external vendor the company 
had used in the past to make system enhancements. 
The objective was to establish system requirements 
and develop business rules to guide the work order 
and scheduling processes. SourceGas’s biggest 
 priorities were to 1) automate work scheduling; 2) 
maintain the company’s existing timesheet process; 
and 3) ensure minimal change required for field 
technicians to use the new system.
For its solution, SourceGas chose SAP Workforce 
Scheduling & Optimization software package by 
ClickSoftware, which integrates with its existing 
SAP systems, including SAP ERP and SAP CRM. 
SAP Workforce Scheduling & Optimization by 
ClickSoftware is a real-time optimized scheduling 
solution for managing scheduling and dispatching, 
supporting mobile service operations, schedul-
ing service appointments, and monitoring service 
operations. The software includes capabilities 
for demand forecasting to determine how much 
work is set to arrive, when, and where; deploying 
resources based on knowledge of worker skills, ser-
vice commitments, location, and customer prefer-
ences; responding in real time to on-the-spot issues 
such as traffic and cancellations; and analyzing 
service performance by identifying problem areas 
and methods for improvement. Software users 
are able to meet anticipated workloads in a spe-
cific time frame with better capacity planning and 
resource allocation. SAP Workforce Scheduling & 
Optimization software integrates directly with all 
SAP applications.
An SAP NetWeaver Process Integration adapter 
automatically handles the messaging between the 
SAP Workforce Scheduling & Optimization and the 
SAP CRM system. Work orders are now automati-
cally scheduled and dispatched using the company’s 
business rules configured in the system, with excep-
tions flagged for dispatchers to handle. 
The entire process of implementing the new 
 system-requirements analysis, development, 
testing, and training, took a little over one year. 
SourceGas rolled out the system in phases, with 
its last division going live with the system in 
December 2012. In implementing the SAP software 
package, SourceGas faced some special challenges 
because it had to design the system and configure 
the software to account for all the special conditions 
of its unique service area and complex rules for 
types of work. Some of the questions that had to be 
addressed were: Are work order priorities the same 
in an urban area, such as Fayetteville, Arkansas, 
as they are in rural Wyoming? What constitutes an 
emergency work order? 
The SourceGas system had to be designed to 
schedule and route all the field technician work 
according to these various rules and conditions. 
The design also had to make the system as familiar 
and easy to use for SourceGas mobile workers as 
possible, with the new mobile app user experience 
mirroring field workers’ existing user experience 
as much as possible. This was especially critical for 
time reporting, which required some simplification 
while adhering nevertheless to company business 
rules for proper accounting. 
SourceGas was able to enhance the software 
while maintaining the same user experience. To 
improve technician efficiency, the software was 
enhanced to tailor service order completion data 
sent back to SourceGas’s ERP system for each type 
of service order rather than displaying all data fields 
on all orders. Another important enhancement was 
to add audio alerts for dispatchers and technicians’ 
mobile devices to the SAP Workforce Scheduling 
& Optimization software so that emergency orders 
receive proper attention. An additional safety 
 feature is the capability for technicians to set a 
timer to alert dispatch if they haven’t returned to 
their vehicle by a specified time.
SourceGas used an iterative approach and agile 
development methodology and took user input and 
user training very seriously. The system project 
had a committee of super-user technicians as well 
as an operations team to make sure the system was 
built to the right specifications. Its technicians had 
provided important input during the requirements-
gathering and design stages of system-building, and 
they began training on the new application in June 
2012. SourceGas trained 20 percent of its workforce 
to obtain their feedback about the new system (to 
 
Chapter 13 Building Information Systems 
569

make sure it met their expectations), and used the 
experience to create training materials for when 
the system went totally live. This approach helped 
ensure users would buy into the new system and 
that no business process was overlooked.
The testing process had end users on SourceGas’s 
operations team perform all of the approximately 
225 types of service orders handled by the company 
using the new application to make sure the system 
was able to handle every single business scenario. 
For example, to test the process of a technician 
closing out a work order for a meter exchange, the 
new system must be able to move data from a final 
reading of the old meter into SourceGas’s SAP ERP 
system, and the system has to perform certain steps 
before the new meter is recognized and synchro-
nized to a customer account. 
What benefits have been produced by the new 
 system? SourceGas’s management has received 
positive feedback about the new system capabilities 
for automated scheduling, timesheet preparation 
as well as its improved usability compared to the 
 previous system. Managers can more accurately 
gauge their workload in their divisions. SourceGas 
dispatchers can see their workloads more  accurately 
and determine the appropriate resources. The 
company has already used the new system to 
complete 400,000 work orders and pay 900,000 
timesheet records. However, management would 
like to see more manpower study reports before 
it can  determine the extent of the new system’s 
 operational efficiencies and benefits.
One key benefit that is already apparent, 
 however, is the company’s ability to keep a lid on 
the costs of maintaining and updating the system 
because it is doing most of that work with in-house 
staff rather than turning to external vendors, as it 
had in the past. The SAP Workforce Scheduling and 
Optimization software package has made it possible 
for SourceGas to rapidly make changes in-house, 
which makes it easier for the company to respond 
to rapid changes in the utility industry.
SourceGas will be further enhancing its SAP 
Workforce Scheduling and Optimization software to 
focus more directly on serving customers. Potential 
changes to the system include allowing customers 
to place orders online, sending text messages to 
inform customers when technicians are on the way, 
and processing payment from customers directly in 
the field.

u Skin Enterprises is an American direct-selling and multilevel 
marketing  company which sells more than 200 anti-aging personal 
care and dietary supplements  products through more than 830,000 
independent distributors. Since its beginnings in 1984 in Provo, 
Utah, the company has expanded operations to 52 international markets. 
Annual revenues have topped 1 billion dollars.
Nu Skin’s business model combines direct selling with multilevel market-
ing. Each distributor markets products directly to potential customers, and 
can also recruit and train customers to become distributors. Distributors are 
paid from the retail markup on products they are able to sell personally, as 
well as a percentage of the sales of distributors they have recruited. To be suc-
cessful, Nu Skin obviously must pay close attention to how it manages people.
Although Nu Skin has nearly 6,000 employees in 28 different countries, 
until recently, it did not have a centralized human resources (HR) system to 
maintain employee data or to  provide HR reporting to other parts of the busi-
ness. Instead, it managed employees manually at the local level or allowed 
local operating units to use their own systems. In order to obtain employee 
information at the corporate level, Nu Skin had to contact the region and 
obtain the data manually. All of this was very time-consuming, and the com-
pany really needed more  consistent and automated HR processes.
When Nu Skin’s management decided to implement a centralized HR sys-
tem, a cross- functional project team representing human resources and the 
information systems department conducted a thorough two-year analysis of 
information needs and searched for the right system. It recommended SAP

Members of the project team were selected so that their HR expertise and 
experience would complement each other. Team members included several 
SAP business analysts, a programmer analyst, a technical business analyst, an 
HR information systems analyst, and a team of senior systems engineers. Vice 
President of Human Resources David Daines and IT Business Integration lead-
ers Amy Camara and Jay Barney supported the team.
External consultants from Symphony Consulting were hired to assist the 
project team in identifying information requirements from various Nu Skin 
offices. Consultants were hired on the basis of skills and personality that would 
enhance the team, as well as the ability to  perform on-site training. Nu Skin’s 
users were in so many different geographic locations that it would be impossi-
ble for them to train in the new system off-site. The consultants were assigned 
to train employees on-site during the implementation. 
Through every step of the project, the company was careful to put “people” 
before technology. What kind of people should be on the project team? What 
consultants should be employed? What are the business and culture require-
ments that have to be addressed? 
The project team visited various Nu Skin sites in each of the company’s mar-
kets to inquire about the data each collected, what systems and reports they 
used with the data, and what they wanted in the future. These face-to-face 
meetings sensitized the project team to the regional differences in information 
requirements and corporate culture. The meetings also gave end users a stron-
ger sense of ownership in the project and the belief that the project team was 
dedicated to making the new system work for their benefit.
The project team used a phased implementation approach for each global 
region. In 2011, Nu Skin went live with the SAP ERP HCM global functional-
ity. Benefits were immediate. In the past, if the finance department needed a 
report on the number of full-time employees in a specific market, the Nu Skin 
HR department had to request the information from the local operating unit, 
which could take weeks. A report about which employees transferred to 
another department or left the company had to be manually created by 
 gathering the required data from the various regions and manually sending 
the report to the different departments. Now all of these reports are automati-
cally generated and distributed by the system.

O
ne of the principal challenges posed by information systems is 
ensuring they deliver genuine business benefits. There is a very 
high failure rate among information systems projects because organizations 
have incorrectly assessed their business value or because firms have failed 
to manage the organizational change surrounding the introduction of new 
technology.
Nu Skin’s management realized this when it implemented its HR  system. 
The new system involved an enterprise-wide change in HR  business 
 processes supported by new software. Nu Skin  succeeded in this project 
because its management clearly understood that attention to organizational 
“people” issues was essential for success, especially in a multinational 
 company with numerous regional and cultural  differences. 
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter. Nu Skin desperately needed to automate its HR 
 processes, which had been entirely manual and made operations highly

14.1 WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF PROJECT 
MANAGEMENT AND WHY IS IT SO ESSENTIAL IN 
DEVELOPING INFORMATION SYSTEMS?
T
here is a very high failure rate among information systems projects.
In nearly every organization, information systems projects take much 
more time and money to implement than originally anticipated or 
the completed system does not work properly. When an information 
system does not meet expectations or costs too much to develop, companies 
may not realize any benefit from their information system investment, and the 
system may not be able to solve the problems for which it was intended. The 
development of a new system must be carefully managed and orchestrated, and 
the way a project is executed is likely to be the most important factor influencing 
its outcome. That’s why it’s essential to have some knowledge about managing 
information systems projects and the reasons why they succeed or fail.
RUNAWAY PROJECTS AND SYSTEM FAILURE
How badly are projects managed? On average, private sector projects are 
 underestimated by one-half in terms of budget and time required to deliver the 
 inefficient. Management wisely selected a project team whose members had 
both business and technical expertise. The team took great care and time to 
identify the right software solution and to elicit user information requirements. 
Staging the system implementation and conducting employee training at each 
location further contributed to success. 
Here are some questions to think about: Why was it important to have 
 representatives from both HR and IT on the project team? What were the risk 
factors in this project?
 
Chapter 14 Managing Projects

complete system promised in the system plan. Many projects are  delivered with 
missing functionality (promised for delivery in later versions). The Standish 
Group consultancy, which monitors IT project success rates, found that only 32 
percent of all technology investments were completed on time, on budget, and 
with all features and functions originally specified (McCafferty, 2010). A joint 
study by McKinsey and Oxford University found that large software  projects on 
average run 66 percent over budget and 33 percent over schedule; as many as 
17 percent of projects turn out so badly that they can threaten the  existence of 
the company (Chandrasekaran et. al., 2014). Between 30 and 40 percent of all 
software projects are “runaway” projects that far exceed the original  schedule 
and budget projections and fail to perform as originally specified.
As illustrated in Figure 14.1, a systems development project without proper 
management will most likely suffer these consequences:
• Costs that vastly exceed budgets
• Unexpected time slippage
• Technical performance that is less than expected
• Failure to obtain anticipated benefits
The systems produced by failed information projects are often not used in 
the way they were intended, or they are not used at all. Users often have to 
develop parallel manual systems to make these systems work.
The actual design of the system may fail to capture essential business 
requirements or improve organizational performance. Information may not be 
provided quickly enough to be helpful, it may be in a format that is impossible 
to digest and use, or it may represent the wrong pieces of data.
The way in which nontechnical business users must interact with the system 
may be excessively complicated and discouraging. A system may be designed 
with a poor user interface. The user interface is the part of the system with 
which end users interact. For example, an online input form or data entry 
screen may be so poorly arranged that no one wants to submit data or request 
information. System outputs may be displayed in a format that is too difficult 
to comprehend.
Web sites may discourage visitors from exploring further if the Web pages are 
cluttered and poorly arranged, if users cannot easily find the information they 
are seeking, or if it takes too long to access and display the Web page on the 
user’s computer.
Additionally, the data in the system may have a high level of inaccuracy or 
inconsistency. The information in certain fields may be erroneous or ambigu-
ous, or it may not be organized properly for business purposes. Information 
required for a specific business function may be inaccessible because the data 
are incomplete.
 FIGURE 14.1  CONSEQUENCES OF POOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Without proper management, a systems development project takes longer to complete and most often 
exceeds the allocated budget. The resulting information system most likely is technically inferior and 
may not be able to demonstrate any benefits to the organization.

WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC TAKES ON THE RISKS OF A “BIG BANG” 
PROJECT
Westinghouse Electric Company provides fuel, 
 services, technology, plant design, and equipment 
to utility and industrial customers in the worldwide 
commercial nuclear electric power industry. A 
 private company created in 1999 after its predeces-
sor was sold and spun off, Westinghouse has 14,500 
employees in 17 countries and is headquartered in 
Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania. Shortly after 
Westinghouse’s creation, the company implemented 
a full suite of SAP software across the enterprise. 
For the past 15 years, the nuclear energy 
 industry was in a holding pattern, with steady 
 business throughout but minimal growth. 
Westinghouse supplied nuclear equipment and 
services to plants all around the world, and the 
business was successful. The initial SAP instal-
lation served Westinghouse just fine for nearly 
an entire decade. From 2010 onward, the nuclear 
energy industry started to expand. Westinghouse 
began to experience growth in sales, and its legacy 
SAP installation was not equipped to handle the 
increased volume of business.
Westinghouse needed to update its older  system 
to support new processes, configurations, and 
 functionalities that related to the larger amount of 
business it was conducting. The company estimated 
that it would increase in size fourfold over the next 
few years. Westinghouse opted to launch a sweep-
ing new program to update its IT. The program, 
called Synergy internally, consisted of 40 different 
projects, and updating the SAP system was one of 
the largest.
Rather than simply upgrade its existing sys-
tems, Westinghouse opted to “re-implement” those 
 systems with much more current SAP technology. 
Westinghouse did this because its 10-year-old SAP 
ERP implementation was too outdated. It was easier 
for the company to simply replace the old SAP ERP 
systems with a completely new configuration. The 
division of the Synergy project dedicated to the 
SAP re-implementation was known as Cornerstone, 
aptly named because the new system would be the 
 foundation for the company’s future growth.
Westinghouse wanted to start with a clean-
core SAP environment with a completely new 
 reconfiguration. The company’s goals were to 
 convert all existing data that the company wanted 
to save, as well as add new functionalities that 
would help the company manage its imminent 
growth. Westinghouse hoped to add a new  general 
ledger, a new enterprise reporting environment 
based on SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse 
(BW) and SAP BusinessObjects  solutions, and new 
implementations of SAP Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM).
In order to ensure that the re-implementation 
went smoothly, Westinghouse took many precau-
tions to manage the risks involved in such a sig-
nificant change. First, the company ensured that 
every element of the Cornerstone project was moti-
vated by a particular business driver or goal. By 
associating goals with each element of the project, 
Westinghouse was able to more precisely control 
the implementation of the new system.
Once the elements of the new SAP system came 
into place, Westinghouse had to decide how to 
 actually roll out the new system. It could have used a 
gradual, phased approach, adding new systems over 
a three-year period, but the company instead decided 
on what it called a “big-bang approach.” Management 
decided that the company was  growing too fast for 
a slow approach—it needed the new systems as 
soon as possible, and hoped to recoup the return on 
investment sooner rather than later. However, while 
the phased approach was more expensive, it was also 
much less risky. To manage the increased risk of the 
big-bang approach, the company brought in a change 
management consultant.
The consultant, John Flynn, helped Westinghouse 
with both the Synergy and Cornerstone projects, 
but focused on Cornerstone. Flynn  performed a risk 
assessment study to identify  business areas that were 
most likely to undergo significant change. He identi-
fied the Westinghouse supply chain as one of these, 
since the company’s growth would add many new 
elements to the chain. Therefore, the change man-
agement team spent extra time with Westinghouse’s 
supply chain staff members to help them understand 
the new project and its impact on their day-to-day 
routines.
Next, after mapping the risk associated with 
each element of the SAP re-implementation, 
Westinghouse had to finally switch, or cut over, 
to the new system. To handle that event, Flynn 
worked with business leaders to recruit coordina-
tors for every site in the organization. Each site

coordinator had a list of responsibilities and a 
checklist to complete prior to the system going 
live to ensure each site was ready when the switch 
was flipped. Westinghouse dedicated extra staff 
to answer employee questions in the problem 
areas designated by Flynn. The company created 
an automatic call distribution system and e-mail 
 system that routed users across all time zones to the 
employees most able to answer their questions. For 
example, Westinghouse expected that there would 
be many questions about passwords, access issues, 
time entry, and purchase requisition management 
after the new system went live, so the company 
provided extra staff to answer those and other 
 frequently asked questions. This “temporary help 
desk” handled over 2,000 inquiries during the first

three weeks of the implementation. The project 
team also set up a blog where users could share tips 
and solutions.
The cutover to the new SAP system went 
smoothly, and the company plans to use many 
of the techniques that it learned from the imple-
mentation in the future. It plans to use the blog 
as its  primary communication method for support 
 solutions and other Synergy projects, and future 
additions to the SAP suite will be much easier than 
the sweeping big-bang change.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES
A project is a planned series of related activities for achieving a specific 
 business objective. Information systems projects include the development of 
new information systems, enhancement of existing systems, or upgrade or 
replacement of the firm’s information technology (IT) infrastructure.
Project management refers to the application of knowledge, skills, 
tools, and techniques to achieve specific targets within specified budget 
and time constraints. Project management activities include planning the 
work,  assessing risk, estimating resources required to accomplish the work, 
 organizing the work, acquiring human and material resources, assigning 
tasks, directing activities, controlling project execution, reporting progress, 
and analyzing the results. As in other areas of business, project management 
for information systems must deal with five major variables: scope, time, 
cost, quality, and risk.
Scope defines what work is or is not included in a project. For example, the 
scope of a project for a new order processing system might be to include new 
modules for inputting orders and transmitting them to production and account-
ing but not any changes to related accounts receivable, manufacturing, distribu-
tion, or inventory control systems. Project management defines all the work

BRITAIN’S NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE JETTISONS CHOOSE AND 
BOOK SYSTEM
When senior cardiologist Duncan Dymond 
 complained in 2010 that patients were arriving at his 
hospital at incorrect times and, far worse, in need 
of a different specialist, it was neither the beginning 
nor the end of problems with the Choose and Book 
system. Installed in 2004 as part of a £200 million 
IT modernization of Great Britain’s National Health 
Service (NHS), the patient booking system was 
 supposed to enable patients to select a hospital for 
an outpatient appointment from a range of options, 
primarily with the help and direction of their general 
practitioner (GP). A letter with a referral number and 
a secure code was then generated so that the patient 
could either go online or call a central booking  service 
to confirm the appointment. Initial contact could also 
occur directly via the national appointments line or 
at the HealthSpace Web site. The goals were three-
fold: to speed up the referral process, eliminate costly 
paperwork, and encourage patient participation so as 
to stem losses of up to £225 million annually from 1.6 
million patient no-shows. 
Implementation was sluggish and plagued with 
glitches. One early problem was that many hospital 
Patient Administration Systems (PAS) and GP  clinical 
computer systems were not compatible. Choose 
and Book served as the go-between between the two 
 systems, thus, both had to be compliant. The objec-
tive to book 90 percent of all referrals by December 
2006 was never met. Four years later, even though 
Choose and Book had been installed in 94 percent of 
all GP surgeries, it was used to book just 54 percent of 
appointments. Even a three year £100 million incen-
tive program to encourage physician adoption failed 
to sway doctors who had witnessed patients unneces-
sarily travelling to distant hospitals and referral letters 
rebuffed when patients sought confirmation.
Designers also focused on building provider 
choice into the service. This turned out to be a 
 solution in search of a problem. According to the 
NHS Alliance, a coalition of health care provid-
ers, managers, and patients dedicated to improving 
care and providing a voice to patients, the ability to 
choose physicians and facilities from a wide range of 
options was never a chief concern. Instead, patients 
were looking for swift referrals to their local hospital. 
In rural areas, choice was considerably limited any-
way, and older patients, in particular, simply found 
the array of choices  confusing, difficult to navigate, 
and time-consuming to select.
Although many doctors were fans, system misfires 
created a significant population of disgruntled care-
givers who refused to use Choose and Book. Glitches 
included appointment letters gone astray, last-min-
ute cancellations, costs incurred for phone calls to 
the booking line in some locations, and treatment 
delays due to lack of visit categorization—either 
urgent or routine—not incorporated because cases 
requiring immediate treatment bypassed the queu-
ing system.
By 2014, Choose and Book’s cost had ballooned 
to £356 million. Still, out of a total public invest-
ment of £12.7 billion for the National Programme 
for IT (NPfIT), it was considered to be one of its few 
 successes, providing reliable, secure, and certain 
referrals for more than half of first-time outpatients 
and used—at least to some degree—by over 90 
 percent of providers. But when a study by the Public 
Accounts Committee (PAC) reported that use by both 
doctors and patients had dropped and that waiting 
times for elective care had shown no improvement, 
Choose and Book’s days were numbered. The system 
had never been able to function optimally because 
not all available outpatient appointments were 
listed. Members of Parliament (MPs) were fatigued 
by nearly a decade of patchwork fixes and frustrated 
that projected annual savings of up to £51 million 
had never materialized.
The discreet replacement of Choose and Book 
by a new system of unstipulated—and perhaps 
greater—cost underscores both the mission and 
the challenges of NHS. Launched in 1948, the com-
prehensive health system is funded by tax dollars 
(£108.9 billion in 2012/13) and administered by the 
Department of Health (DH). All British citizens are 
afforded care from their first newborn exam to their 
end-of-life care, with many services free of charge. 
NHS England  covers 53 million citizens. Another 
10.2 million people are covered by NHS divisions in 
Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. All told, the 
four divisions of the NHS employ approximately 1.7 
million people, making it the fourth largest employer 
in the world. This includes GPs, nurses, ambulance 
personnel, and  hospital and community health 
 service (HCHS)  medical and dental staff.

1. Clarify and describe the problems of the NHS 
Choose and Book System. What management, 
organization, and technology factors were respon-
sible for those problems?
2. To what extent was Choose and Book a failure? 
Explain your answer.
The most pressing and urgent challenge faced by 
NHS England is the often lengthy waiting time to 
receive care, which can sometimes yield dire conse-
quences. Healthcare for all, regardless of wealth, is a 
core value of British society. A 2013, Commonwealth 
Fund study of national healthcare systems ranked 
NHS first for quality of care, safety, coordination of 
care, patient-centered care, and cost. On timeliness 
of care, the UK ranked third.
With timeliness of care the overriding goal, 
NHS England launched the e-Referral Service 
at the end of 2014. Director of Strategic Systems 
and Technology, Beverley Bryant, expects signifi-
cantly reduced paperwork and fewer data errors, 
along with an accelerated referral process, as 
patients monitor and manage their own hospital 
appointments. Several ideas to encourage adop-
tion are being explored including making physician 
 participation mandatory and developing an incen-
tive  program that incorporates penalties as well as 
rewards. The goal is to improve upon or eliminate 
the flaws of Choose and Book—for example, moving 
away from the hybrid electronic/paper environ-
ment that has proved burdensome for hospitals. 
The switch to all-digital will occur by 2019. 
3. What was the economic and social impact of 
Choose and Book? 
4. Describe the steps that should have been taken to 
make Choose and Book more successful.
The new system uses an open platform and a set 
of application programming interfaces (APIs) both 
of which provide more flexibility to integrate with 
other systems than the restrictive proprietary system 
employed by Choose and Book. What’s more, these 
changes should reduce operating costs. After a decade 
of technological advances, updates would have been 
necessary even had Choose and Book been a resound-
ing success. The new e-Referrals system must trump 
Choose and Book’s record of booking 40,000 referrals 
every day, ensure that all appointment slots are avail-
able, and shuttle citizens to their appointments at a 
quicker pace, all while ensuring that existing health 
care inequalities are not exacerbated.

required to complete a project successfully, and should ensure that the scope of 
a project does not expand beyond what was originally intended.
Time is the amount of time required to complete the project. Project 
 management typically establishes the amount of time required to complete 
major components of a project. Each of these components is further broken 
down into activities and tasks. Project management tries to determine the time 
required to complete each task and establish a schedule for completing the work.
Cost is based on the time to complete a project multiplied by the cost of human 
resources required to complete the project. Information systems project costs 
also include the cost of hardware, software, and work space. Project management 
develops a budget for the project and monitors ongoing project expenses.
Quality is an indicator of how well the end result of a project satisfies the 
 objectives specified by management. The quality of information  systems 
 projects usually boils down to improved organizational performance and 
580 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

 decision making. Quality also considers the accuracy and timeliness of 
 information  produced by the new system and ease of use.
Risk refers to potential problems that would threaten the success of a  project. 
These potential problems might prevent a project from achieving its  objectives 
by increasing time and cost, lowering the quality of project outputs, or 
 preventing the project from being completed altogether. Section 14.4 describes 
the most important risk factors for information systems. 
14.2 WHAT METHODS CAN BE USED FOR SELECTING 
AND EVALUATING INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
PROJECTS AND ALIGNING THEM WITH THE 
FIRM’S BUSINESS GOALS?
Companies typically are presented with many different projects for solving 
problems and improving performance. There are far more ideas for systems 
projects than there are resources. Firms will need to select from this group the 
projects that promise the greatest benefit to the business. Obviously, the firm’s 
overall business strategy should drive project selection. How should managers 
choose among all the options?
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE FOR INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS PROJECTS
Figure 14.2 shows the elements of a management structure for information 
systems projects in a large corporation. It helps ensure that the most important 
projects are given priority.
 FIGURE 14.2  MANAGEMENT CONTROL OF SYSTEMS PROJECTS
Each level of management in the hierarchy is responsible for specific aspects of systems projects, and 
this structure helps give priority to the most important systems projects for the organization.
 
Chapter 14 Managing Projects 
581

At the apex of this structure is the corporate strategic planning group 
and the information system steering committee. The corporate strategic 
 planning group is responsible for developing the firm’s strategic plan, which 
may require the  development of new systems. Often, this group will have 
 developed  objective measures of firm performance (called “key performance 
indicators,” introduced in Chapter 12) and choose to support IT projects which 
can make a  substantial improvement in one or several key performance 
 indicators. These performance indicators are reviewed and discussed by the 
firm's board of directors.
The information systems steering committee is the senior management group 
with responsibility for systems development and operation. It is  composed 
of department heads from both end-user and information systems areas. The 
 steering committee reviews and approves plans for systems in all divisions, 
seeks to coordinate and integrate systems, and occasionally becomes involved 
in  selecting specific information systems projects. This group also has a keen 
 awareness of the key performance indicators decided on by higher level  managers 
and the board of directors.
The project team is supervised by a project management group composed of 
information systems managers and end-user managers responsible for oversee-
ing several specific information systems projects. The project team is directly 
responsible for the individual systems project. It consists of systems analysts, 
specialists from the relevant end-user business areas, application programmers, 
and perhaps database specialists. The mix of skills and the size of the project 
team depend on the specific nature of the system solution.
LINKING SYSTEMS PROJECTS TO THE BUSINESS PLAN
In order to identify the information systems projects that will deliver the most 
business value, organizations need to develop an information systems plan 
that supports their overall business plan and in which strategic systems are 
incorporated into top-level planning. The plan serves as a road map indicating 
the direction of systems development (the purpose of the plan), the rationale, 
the current systems/situation, new developments to consider, the management 
strategy, the implementation plan, and the budget (see Table 14.1).
The plan contains a statement of corporate goals and specifies how informa-
tion technology will support the attainment of those goals. The report shows 
how general goals will be achieved by specific systems projects. It  identifies 
specific target dates and milestones that can be used later to evaluate the 
plan’s progress in terms of how many objectives were actually attained in the 
time frame specified in the plan. The plan indicates the key management 
decisions concerning hardware acquisition; telecommunications; centraliza-
tion/decentralization of authority, data, and hardware; and required organi-
zational change. Organizational changes are also usually described, including 
 management and employee training requirements, recruiting efforts, changes 
in  business  processes, and changes in authority, structure, or management 
practice.
In order to plan effectively, firms will need to inventory and document all 
of their information system applications and IT infrastructure components. 
For projects in which benefits involve improved decision making, manag-
ers should try to identify the decision improvements that would provide the 
 greatest  additional value to the firm. They should then develop a set of metrics 
to  quantify the value of more timely and precise information on the outcome of 
the decision. (See Chapter 12 for more detail on this topic.)

INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS AND KEY 
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 
To develop an effective information systems plan, the organization must have 
a clear understanding of both its long- and short-term information require-
ments. A strategic approach to information requirements, strategic analysis, or 
 critical success factors argues that an organization’s information requirements 
are determined by a small number of key performance indicators (KPIs) 
of managers. KPIs are shaped by the industry, the firm, the manager, and the 
broader environment. For instance, KPIs for an automobile firm might be 
unit production costs, labor costs, factory productivity, re-work and error rate, 
 customer brand recognition surveys, J.D. Power quality rankings, employee job 
satisfaction ratings, and health costs. New information systems should focus 
on providing information that helps the firm meet these goals implied by key 
 performance indicators.
PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS
Once strategic analyses have determined the overall direction of  systems 
development, portfolio analysis can be used to evaluate alternative system 
projects. Portfolio analysis inventories all of the organization’s  information 
systems projects and assets, including infrastructure, outsourcing  contracts, 
and licenses. This portfolio of information systems investments can be 
described as having a certain profile of risk and benefit to the firm (see
Figure 14.3) similar to a financial portfolio.
Each information systems project carries its own set of risks and benefits. 
(Section 14.4 describes the factors that increase the risks of systems  projects.) 
Firms would try to improve the return on their portfolios of IT assets by 
 balancing the risk and return from their systems investments. Although there 
is no ideal profile for all firms, information-intensive industries (e.g., finance) 
should have a few high-risk, high-benefit projects to ensure that they stay 
 current with technology. Firms in non-information-intensive industries should 
focus on high-benefit, low-risk projects.
Most desirable, of course, are systems with high benefit and low risk. These 
promise early returns and low risks. Second, high-benefit, high-risk systems 
should be examined; low-benefit, high-risk systems should be totally avoided; 
and low-benefit, low-risk systems should be reexamined for the possibility 
of rebuilding and replacing them with more desirable systems having higher 
 benefits. By using portfolio analysis, management can determine the optimal 
mix of  investment risk and reward for their firms, balancing riskier high-reward 
 projects with safer lower-reward ones. Firms where portfolio analysis is aligned 
with  business strategy have been found to have a superior return on their IT 
assets, better alignment of IT investments with business objectives, and better 
organization-wide coordination of IT investments (Jeffrey and Leliveld, 2004).
SCORING MODELS
A scoring model is useful for selecting projects where many criteria must 
be considered. It assigns weights to various features of a system and then 
 calculates the weighted totals. Using Table 14.2, the firm must decide among 
two alternative enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The first column 
lists the criteria that decision makers will use to evaluate the systems. These 
criteria are usually the result of lengthy discussions among the decision- making 
584 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

group. Often the most important outcome of a scoring model is not the score 
but agreement on the criteria used to judge a system.
Table 14.2 shows that this particular company attaches the most  importance 
to capabilities for sales order processing, inventory management, and ware-
housing. The second column in Table 14.2 lists the weights that decision 
makers attached to the decision criteria. Columns 3 and 5 show the percent-
age of requirements for each function that each alternative ERP system can 
provide. Each vendor’s score can be calculated by multiplying the percentage 
of requirements met for each function by the weight attached to that function. 
ERP System B has the highest total score.
As with all “objective” techniques, there are many qualitative judgments 
involved in using the scoring model. This model requires experts who 
 understand the issues and the technology. It is appropriate to cycle through 
the scoring model several times, changing the criteria and weights, to see how 
sensitive the outcome is to reasonable changes in criteria. Scoring models are 
used most commonly to confirm, to rationalize, and to support decisions, rather 
than as the final arbiters of system selection.
14.3 HOW CAN FIRMS ASSESS THE BUSINESS VALUE 
OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS?
Even if a system project supports a firm’s strategic goals and meets user 
 information requirements, it needs to be a good investment for the firm. The 
value of systems from a financial perspective essentially revolves around 
the issue of return on invested capital. Does a particular information system 
 investment produce sufficient returns to justify its costs?
INFORMATION SYSTEM COSTS AND BENEFITS
Table 14.3 lists some of the more common costs and benefits of systems. 
Tangible benefits can be quantified and assigned a monetary value. Intangible 
 benefits, such as more efficient customer service or enhanced decision making, 
cannot be immediately quantified but may lead to quantifiable gains in the long 
run. Transaction and clerical systems that displace labor and save space always 
 FIGURE 14.3  A SYSTEM PORTFOLIO
Companies should examine their portfolio of projects in terms of potential benefits and likely risks. 
Certain kinds of projects should be avoided altogether and others developed rapidly. There is no ideal 
mix. Companies in different industries have different profiles.
 
Chapter 14 Managing Projects 
585

produce more measurable, tangible benefits than management information 
systems, decision-support systems, and computer- supported collaborative work 
systems (see Chapters 2 and 11).
Chapter 5 introduced the concept of total cost of ownership (TCO), which is 
designed to identify and measure the components of information technology 
expenditures beyond the initial cost of purchasing and installing hardware and 
software. However, TCO analysis provides only part of the information needed 
to evaluate an information technology investment because it does not typi-
cally deal with benefits, cost categories such as complexity costs, and “soft” and 
 strategic factors discussed later in this section.
Capital Budgeting for Information Systems
To determine the benefits of a particular project, you’ll need to calculate all of 
its costs and all of its benefits. Obviously, a project where costs exceed benefits 
should be rejected. But even if the benefits outweigh the costs, additional finan-
cial analysis is required to determine whether the project represents a good 
return on the firm’s invested capital. Capital budgeting models are one of 
several techniques used to measure the value of investing in long-term capital 
investment projects.

Capital budgeting methods rely on measures of cash flows into and out of 
the firm; capital projects generate those cash flows. The investment cost for 
information systems projects is an immediate cash outflow caused by expen-
ditures for hardware, software, and labor. In subsequent years, the invest-
ment may cause additional cash outflows that will be balanced by cash inflows 
resulting from the investment. Cash inflows take the form of increased sales of 
more products (for reasons such as new products, higher quality, or increasing 
market share) or reduced costs in production and operations. The difference 
between cash  outflows and cash inflows is used for calculating the financial 
worth of an investment. Once the cash flows have been established, several 
alternative methods are available for comparing different projects and deciding 
about the investment.
The principal capital budgeting models for evaluating IT projects are: the 
payback method, the accounting rate of return on investment (ROI), net

about how these capital budgeting models are used to justify information 
system  investments in the Learning Tracks for this chapter.
REAL OPTIONS PRICING MODELS
Some information systems projects are highly uncertain, especially invest-
ments in IT infrastructure. Their future revenue streams are unclear and 
their up-front costs are high. Suppose, for instance, that a firm is considering 
a $20 million investment to upgrade its IT infrastructure—its hardware, soft-
ware, data management tools, and networking technology. If this upgraded 
infrastructure were available, the organization would have the technology 
capabilities to respond more easily to future problems and opportunities. 
Although the costs of this investment can be calculated, not all of the benefits 
of making this investment can be established in advance. But if the firm waits 
a few years until the revenue potential becomes more obvious, it might be too 
late to make the infrastructure investment. In such cases, managers might 
benefit from using real options pricing models to evaluate information tech-
nology investments.
Real options pricing models (ROPMs) use the concept of options  valuation 
borrowed from the financial industry. An option is essentially the right, but not 
the obligation, to act at some future date. A typical call option, for instance, is 
a financial option in which a person buys the right (but not the obligation) to 
purchase an underlying asset (usually a stock) at a fixed price (strike price) on 
or before a given date.
For instance, let’s assume that on September 19, 2014, you could purchase 
a call option for $31.00 that would give you the right to buy a share of Procter 
& Gamble (P&G) common stock for $50 per share on a certain date. Options 
expire over time, and this call option has an expiration date of January 15, 
2016. If the price of P&G common stock does not rise above $50 per share 
by the stock market close on January 15, 2016, you would not exercise the 
option, and the value of the option would fall to zero on the strike date. 
If, however, the price of P&G stock rose to, say, $100 per share, you could 
 purchase the stock for the strike price of $50 and retain the profit of $50 
per share minus the cost on the option. (Because the option is sold as a 100-
share contract, the cost of the contract would be 100 × $31.00 before com-
missions, or $3100, and you would be  purchasing and obtaining a profit from 
100 shares of Procter & Gamble.) The stock option enables the owner to ben-
efit from the upside potential of an opportunity while limiting the downside 
risk.
ROPMs value information systems projects similar to stock options, where 
an initial expenditure on technology creates the opportunity to obtain the ben-
efits associated with further development and deployment of the  technology 
as long as management has the freedom to cancel, defer, restart, or expand the 
project. ROPMs give managers the flexibility to stage their IT investment or test 
the waters with small pilot projects or prototypes to gain more knowledge about 
the risks of a project before investing in the entire implementation. The disad-
vantages of this model are  primarily in  estimating all the key variables affecting 
option value, including anticipated cash flows from the underlying asset and 
changes in the cost of  implementation. Models for determining option value 
of information technology platforms are being developed (Fichman, 2004; 
McGrath and MacMillan, 2000).

LIMITATIONS OF FINANCIAL MODELS
The traditional focus on the financial and technical aspects of an informa-
tion system tends to overlook the social and organizational dimensions of 
information systems that may affect the true costs and benefits of the invest-
ment. Many companies’ information systems investment decisions do not 
adequately consider costs from organizational disruptions created by a new 
system, such as the cost to train end users, the impact that users’ learning 
curves for a new system have on productivity, or the time managers need to 
spend overseeing new system-related changes. Benefits, such as more timely 
decisions from a new system or enhanced employee learning and expertise, 
may also be overlooked in a traditional financial analysis (Ryan, Harrison, 
and Schkade, 2002).
14.4 WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS IN 
INFORMATION SYSTEMS PROJECTS, AND HOW 
CAN THEY BE MANAGED? 
We have already introduced the topic of information system risks and risk 
assessment in Chapter 8. In this chapter, we describe the specific risks to 
information systems projects and show what can be done to manage them 
effectively.
DIMENSIONS OF PROJECT RISK
Systems differ dramatically in their size, scope, level of complexity, and 
 organizational and technical components. Some systems development projects 
are more likely to create the problems we have described earlier or to suffer 
delays because they carry a much higher level of risk than others. The level 
of project risk is influenced by project size, project structure, and the level of 
 technical expertise of the information systems staff and project team.
• Project size. The larger the project—as indicated by the dollars spent, the size 
of the implementation staff, the time allocated for implementation, and the 
number of organizational units affected—the greater the risk. Very large-scale 
systems projects have a failure rate that is 50 to 75 percent higher than that 
for other projects because such projects are complex and difficult to control. 
The organizational complexity of the system—how many units and groups 
use it and how much it influences business processes—contribute to the 
complexity of large-scale systems projects just as much as technical charac-
teristics, such as the number of lines of program code, length of project, and 
budget. In addition, there are few reliable techniques for estimating the time 
and cost to develop large-scale information systems.
• Project structure. Some projects are more highly structured than others. Their 
requirements are clear and straightforward so outputs and processes can 
be easily defined. Users know exactly what they want and what the system 
should do; there is almost no possibility of the users changing their minds. 
Such projects run a much lower risk than those with relatively undefined, 
fluid, and constantly changing requirements; with outputs that cannot be 
fixed easily because they are subject to users’ changing ideas; or with users 
who cannot agree on what they want.
• Experience with technology. The project risk rises if the project team and the 
information system staff lack the required technical expertise. If the team 
 
Chapter 14 Managing Projects 
589

is unfamiliar with the hardware, system software, application software, or 
database management system proposed for the project, it is highly likely that 
the project will experience technical problems or take more time to complete 
because of the need to master new skills.
Although the difficulty of the technology is one risk factor in information 
 systems projects, the other factors are primarily organizational, dealing with 
the complexity of information requirements, the scope of the project, and how 
many parts of the organization will be affected by a new information system.
CHANGE MANAGEMENT AND THE CONCEPT OF 
IMPLEMENTATION
The introduction or alteration of an information system has a powerful behav-
ioral and organizational impact. Changes in the way that information is defined, 
accessed, and used to manage the organization’s resources often lead to new 
distributions of authority and power. This internal organizational change 
breeds resistance and opposition and can lead to the demise of an otherwise 
good system.
A very large percentage of information systems projects stumble because the 
process of organizational change surrounding system building was not properly 
addressed. Successful system building requires careful change management.
The Concept of Implementation
To manage the organizational change surrounding the introduction of a new 
information system effectively, you must examine the process of implemen-
tation. Implementation refers to all organizational activities working toward 
the adoption, management, and routinization of an innovation, such as a 
new  formation system. In the implementation process, the systems analyst is 
a change agent. The analyst not only develops technical solutions but also 
redefines the configurations, interactions, job activities, and power relation-
ships of various organizational groups. The analyst is the catalyst for the entire 
change process and is responsible for ensuring that all parties involved accept 
the changes created by a new system. The change agent communicates with 
users, mediates between competing interest groups, and ensures that the 
 organizational adjustment to such changes is complete.
The Role of End Users
System implementation generally benefits from high levels of user involve-
ment and management support. User participation in the design and operation 
of information systems has several positive results. First, if users are heavily 
involved in systems design, they have more opportunities to mold the system 
according to their priorities and business requirements, and more opportuni-
ties to control the outcome. Second, they are more likely to react positively 
to the completed system because they have been active participants in the 
change process. Incorporating user knowledge and expertise leads to better 
solutions.
The relationship between users and information systems specialists has 
 traditionally been a problem area for information systems implementa-
tion efforts. Users and information systems specialists tend to have different 
 backgrounds, interests, and priorities. This is referred to as the user-designer 
communications gap. These differences lead to divergent organizational 
 loyalties, approaches to problem solving, and vocabularies.
590 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

Information systems specialists, for example, often have a highly  technical, 
or machine, orientation to problem solving. They look for elegant and sophis-
ticated technical solutions in which hardware and software efficiency is 
 optimized at the expense of ease of use or organizational effectiveness. Users 
prefer systems that are oriented toward solving business problems or facilitat-
ing organizational tasks. Often the orientations of both groups are so at odds 
that they appear to speak in different tongues.
These differences are illustrated in Table 14.4, which depicts the typical 
 concerns of end users and technical specialists (information systems design-
ers) regarding the development of a new information system. Communication 
 problems between end users and designers are a major reason why user require-
ments are not properly incorporated into information systems and why users 
are driven out of the implementation process.
Systems development projects run a very high risk of failure when there 
is a pronounced gap between users and technical specialists and when these 
groups continue to pursue different goals. Under such conditions, users are 
often driven away from the project. Because they cannot comprehend what the 
technicians are saying, users conclude that the entire project is best left in the 
hands of the information specialists alone.
Management Support and Commitment
If an information systems project has the backing and commitment of 
 management at various levels, it is more likely to be perceived positively 
by both users and the technical information services staff. Both groups will 
believe that their participation in the development process will receive 
higher-level attention and priority. They will be recognized and rewarded 
for the time and effort they devote to implementation. Management backing 
also ensures that a systems project receives sufficient funding and resources 
to be  successful. Furthermore, to be enforced effectively, all the changes in 
work habits and procedures and any organizational realignments associated 
with a new system depend on management backing. If a manager considers 
a new system a priority, the system will more likely be treated that way by 
his or her subordinates.
Change Management Challenges for Business Process 
Reengineering, Enterprise Applications, and Mergers

find a very high failure rate among enterprise application and business process

reengineering (BPR) projects, which typically require extensive organizational 
change and which may require replacing old technologies and legacy systems 
that are deeply rooted in many interrelated business processes. A number 
of studies have indicated that 70 percent of all business process reengineer-
ing projects fail to deliver promised benefits. Likewise, a high percentage of 
 enterprise applications fail to be fully implemented or to meet the goals of their 
users even after three years of work.
Many enterprise application and reengineering projects have been 
 undermined by poor implementation and change management practices that 
failed to address employees’ concerns about change. Dealing with fear and 
anxiety throughout the organization, overcoming resistance by key managers, 
and changing job functions, career paths, and recruitment practices have posed 
greater threats to reengineering than the difficulties companies faced visual-
izing and designing breakthrough changes to business processes. All of the 
enterprise applications require tighter coordination among different functional 
groups as well as extensive business process change (see Chapter 9).
Projects related to mergers and acquisitions have a similar failure rate. 
Mergers and acquisitions are deeply affected by the organizational characteris-
tics of the merging companies as well as by their IT infrastructures. Combining 
the information systems of two different companies usually requires consid-
erable organizational change and complex systems projects to manage. If the 
integration is not properly managed, firms can emerge with a tangled hodge-
podge of inherited legacy systems built by aggregating the systems of one firm 
after another. Without a successful systems integration, the benefits anticipated 
from the merger cannot be realized, or, worse, the merged entity cannot  execute 
its business processes effectively.
CONTROLLING RISK FACTORS
Various project management, requirements gathering, and planning methodol-
ogies have been developed for specific categories of implementation  problems. 
Strategies have also been devised for ensuring that users play appropriate 
roles throughout the implementation period and for managing the organiza-
tional change process. Not all aspects of the implementation process can be 
easily controlled or planned. However, anticipating potential implementa-
tion  problems and applying appropriate corrective strategies can increase the 
chances for system success.
The first step in managing project risk involves identifying the nature and 
level of risk confronting the project (Schmidt et al., 2001). Implementers can 
then handle each project with the tools and risk management approaches 
geared to its level of risk (Iversen, Mathiassen, and Nielsen, 2004; Barki, Rivard, 
and Talbot, 2001; McFarlan, 1981).
Managing Technical Complexity
Projects with challenging and complex technology for users to master  benefit 
from internal integration tools. The success of such projects depends on 
how well their technical complexity can be managed. Project leaders need both 
heavy technical and administrative experience. They must be able to anticipate 
problems and develop smooth working relationships among a predominantly 
technical team. The team should be under the leadership of a manager with 
a strong technical and project management background, and team members 
should be highly experienced. Team meetings should take place frequently. 
592 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

Essential technical skills or expertise not available internally should be secured 
from outside the organization.
Formal Planning and Control Tools
Large projects benefit from appropriate use of formal planning tools and 
formal control tools for documenting and monitoring project plans. The two 
most commonly used methods for documenting project plans are Gantt charts 
and PERT charts. A Gantt chart lists project activities and their correspond-
ing start and completion dates. The Gantt chart visually represents the timing 
and duration of different tasks in a development project as well as their human 
resource requirements (see Figure 14.4). It shows each task as a horizontal bar 
whose length is proportional to the time required to complete it.
Although Gantt charts show when project activities begin and end, they don’t 
depict task dependencies, how one task is affected if another is behind sched-
ule, or how tasks should be ordered. That is where PERT charts are useful. 
PERT stands for Program Evaluation and Review Technique, a methodology 
developed by the U.S. Navy during the 1950s to manage the Polaris subma-
rine missile program. A PERT chart graphically depicts project tasks and their 
 interrelationships. The PERT chart lists the specific activities that make up a 
project and the activities that must be completed before a specific activity can 
start, as illustrated in Figure 14.5.
The PERT chart portrays a project as a network diagram consisting of 
 numbered nodes (either circles or rectangles) representing project tasks. 
Each node is numbered and shows the task, its duration, the starting date, 
and the completion date. The direction of the arrows on the lines indicates 
the sequence of tasks and shows which activities must be completed before 
the commencement of another activity. In Figure 14.5, the tasks in nodes 2, 
3, and 4 are not  dependent on each other and can be undertaken simultane-
ously, but each is dependent on completion of the first task. PERT charts for 
complex projects can be difficult to interpret, and project managers often use 
both techniques.
These project management techniques can help managers identify bottle-
necks and determine the impact that problems will have on project comple-
tion times. They can also help systems developers partition projects into 
smaller, more manageable segments with defined, measurable business results. 
Standard control techniques can successfully chart the progress of the project 
against budgets and target dates, so deviations from the plan can be spotted.
Increasing User Involvement and Overcoming User 
Resistance
Projects with relatively little structure and many undefined requirements 
must involve users fully at all stages. Users must be mobilized to support one 
of many possible design options and to remain committed to a single design. 
External integration tools consist of ways to link the work of the implemen-
tation team to users at all organizational levels. For instance, users can become 
active  members of the project team, take on leadership roles, and take charge of 
installation and training. The implementation team can demonstrate its respon-
siveness to users, promptly answering questions, incorporating user feedback, 
and  showing their willingness to help.
Participation in implementation activities may not be enough to overcome 
the problem of user resistance to organizational change. Different users may 
be affected by the system in different ways. Whereas some users may welcome

a new system because it brings changes they perceive as beneficial to them, 
others may resist these changes because they believe the shifts are detrimental 
to their interests.
If the use of a system is voluntary, users may choose to avoid it; if use is 
mandatory, resistance will take the form of increased error rates, disruptions, 
turnover, and even sabotage. Therefore, the implementation strategy must not 
only encourage user participation and involvement, but it must also address 
the issue of counterimplementation. Counterimplementation is a deliberate 
strategy to thwart the implementation of an information system or an innova-
tion in an organization.
Strategies to overcome user resistance include user participation (to elicit 
commitment as well as to improve design), user education and training, 
 management edicts and policies, and better incentives for users who cooperate. 
The new system can be made more user friendly by improving the end-user 
interface. Users will be more cooperative if organizational problems are solved 
prior to introducing the new system.
DESIGNING FOR THE ORGANIZATION
Because the purpose of a new system is to improve the organization’s 
 performance, information systems projects must explicitly address the ways in 
which the organization will change when the new system is installed, includ-
ing installation of intranets, extranets, and Web applications. In addition to

with preceding and succeeding tasks.
 
Chapter 14 Managing Projects 
595

procedural changes, transformations in job functions, organizational structure, 
power relationships, and the work environment should be carefully planned.
Areas where users interface with the system require special attention, 
with sensitivity to ergonomics issues. Ergonomics refers to the interaction of 
people and machines in the work environment. It considers the design of jobs, 
health issues, and the end-user interface of information systems. Table 14.5 
lists the organizational dimensions that must be addressed when planning and 
 implementing information systems.
Although systems analysis and design activities are supposed to include 
an organizational impact analysis, this area has traditionally been neglected.
An organizational impact analysis explains how a proposed system will 
affect organizational structure, attitudes, decision making, and operations.
To integrate information systems successfully with the organization, thorough 
and fully documented organizational impact assessments must be given more 
attention in the development effort.
Sociotechnical Design
One way of addressing human and organizational issues is to incorporate 
 sociotechnical design practices into information systems projects. Designers 
set forth separate sets of technical and social design solutions. The social 
design plans explore different workgroup structures, allocation of tasks, and 
the design of individual jobs. The proposed technical solutions are compared 
with the  proposed social solutions. The solution that best meets both social and 
 technical objectives is selected for the final design. The resulting sociotechni-
cal design is expected to produce an information system that blends technical 
efficiency with sensitivity to organizational and human needs, leading to higher 
job satisfaction and productivity.
PROJECT MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE TOOLS
Commercial software tools that automate many aspects of project  management 
facilitate the project management process. Project management  software 
 typically features capabilities for defining and ordering tasks, assigning 
resources to tasks, establishing starting and ending dates to tasks, tracking 
 progress, and facilitating modifications to tasks and resources. Many automate 
the creation of Gantt and PERT charts.
Some of these tools are large sophisticated programs for managing very large 
projects, dispersed work groups, and enterprise functions. These  high-end

tools can manage very large numbers of tasks and activities and complex 
relationships.
Microsoft Project has become the most widely used project  management 
software today. It is PC-based, with capabilities for producing PERT and Gantt 
charts and for supporting critical path analysis, resource allocation, project 
tracking, and status reporting. Project also tracks the way changes in one aspect 
of a project affect others. Products such as Easy Projects and Vertabase are 
useful for firms that want Web-based project management tools.
Going forward, delivery of project management software as a software 
 service (SaaS) will make this technology accessible to more organizations, 
 especially smaller ones. Open source versions of project management software 
such as Open Workbench and OpenProj will further reduce the total cost of 
ownership and attract new users. Thanks to the popularity of social media such 
as Facebook and Twitter, project management software is also likely to become 
more flexible, collaborative, and user-friendly.
While project management software helps organizations track  individual 
projects, the resources allocated to them, and their costs, project  portfolio 
management software helps organizations manage portfolios of projects 
and dependencies among them. Project portfolio management software 
helps  managers compare proposals and projects against budgets and resource

best achieves the organization’s strategic goals.
Review Summary
1. What are the objectives of project management and why is it so essential in developing information 
systems?
Good project management is essential for ensuring that systems are delivered on time, on budget, 
and provide genuine business benefits. Project management activities include planning the work, 
assessing the risk, estimating and acquiring resources required to accomplish the work, organizing the 
work, directing execution, and analyzing the results. Project management must deal with five major 
variables: scope, time, cost, quality, and risk.
2. What methods can be used for selecting and evaluating information systems projects and aligning 
them with the firm’s business goals?
Organizations need an information systems plan that describes how information technology supports 
the attainment of their business goals and documents all their system applications and IT infrastructure 
components. Large corporations will have a management structure to ensure the most important  systems 
projects receive priority. Key performance indicators, portfolio analysis, and scoring models can be used 
to identify and evaluate alternative information systems projects.
3. How can firms assess the business value of information systems projects?
To determine whether an information systems project is a good investment, one must calculate its 
costs and benefits. Tangible benefits are quantifiable, and intangible benefits that cannot be immedi-
ately quantified may provide quantifiable benefits in the future. Benefits that exceed costs should be 
analyzed using capital budgeting methods to make sure a project represents a good return on the firm’s 
invested capital. Real options pricing models, which apply the same techniques for valuing financial 
options to systems investments, can be useful when considering highly uncertain IT investments.

4. What are the principal risk factors in information systems projects, and how can they be managed?
The level of risk in a systems development project is determined by (1) project size, (2) project structure, and 
(3) experience with technology. IS projects are more likely to fail when there is insufficient or improper user 
participation in the systems development process, lack of management support, and poor management of the 
implementation process. There is a very high failure rate among projects involving business process reengi-
neering, enterprise applications, and mergers and acquisitions because they require extensive organizational 
change.
Implementation refers to the entire process of organizational change surrounding the introduction of a 
new information system. User support and involvement and management support and control of the 
 implementation process are essential, as are mechanisms for dealing with the level of risk in each new 
 systems project. Project risk factors can be brought under some control by a contingency approach to project 
management. The risk level of each project determines the appropriate mix of external integration tools, 
internal integration tools, formal planning tools, and formal control tools to be applied.

spreadsheet software to perform capital budgeting  analyses for new information systems investments, and 
using Web tools to analyze the financing for a new home.
Management Decision Problems
14-8  The U.S. Census launched an IT project to arm its census takers in the field with high-tech handheld 
devices that would save taxpayer money by directly beaming population data to headquarters from census 
takers in the field. Census officials signed a $600 million contract with Harris Corporation in 2006 to build 
500,000 devices, but still weren’t sure which features they wanted included in the units. Census officials 
did not specify the testing process to measure the performance of the handheld devices. As the project 
progressed, 400 change requests to project requirements were added. Two years and hundreds of millions 
of taxpayer dollars later, the handhelds were far too slow and unreliable to be used for the 2010 U.S. census. 
What could Census Bureau management and the Harris Corporation have done to prevent this outcome?
14-9 Caterpillar is the world’s leading maker of earth-moving machinery and supplier of agricultural equip-
ment. Caterpillar wants to end its support for its Dealer Business System (DBS), which it licenses to its 
dealers to help them run their businesses. The software in this system is becoming outdated, and senior 
management wants to transfer support for the hosted version of the software to Accenture Consultants so 
it can concentrate on its core business. Caterpillar never required its dealers to use DBS, but the system 
had become a de facto standard for doing business with the company. The majority of the 50 Cat dealers in 
North America use some version of DBS, as do about half of the 200 or so Cat dealers in the rest of the 
world. Before Caterpillar turns the product over to Accenture, what factors and issues should it consider? 
What questions should it ask? What questions should its dealers ask?
Discussion Questions
 14-5  Why does portfolio analysis help managers 
decide which systems to build?
 14-6  It has been said that most systems fail because 
systems builders ignore organizational behav-
ior problems. Why might this be so?

Improving Decision Making: Using Spreadsheet Software for Capital 
Budgeting for a New CAD System
Software skills: Spreadsheet formulas and functions
Business skills: Capital budgeting
14-10 
 This project provides you with an opportunity to use spreadsheet software to use the capital budgeting 
models discussed in this chapter to analyze the return on an investment for a new computer-aided design 
(CAD) system.
Your company would like to invest in a new computer-aided design (CAD) system that requires 
 purchasing hardware, software, and networking technology, as well as expenditures for installation,  training, 
and support. MyMISLab contains tables showing each cost component for the new system as well as annual 
maintenance costs over a five-year period, along with a Learning Track on capital budgeting models. You 
believe the new system will reduce the amount of labor required to generate designs and design specifica-
tions, thereby increasing your firm’s annual cash flow. 
• Using the data provided in these tables, create a worksheet that calculates the costs and benefits of 
the investment over a five-year period and analyzes the investment using the four capital budgeting 
models presented in this chapter’s Learning Track. 
• Is this investment worthwhile? Why or why not?
Improving Decision Making: Using Web Tools for Buying and Financing a 
Home
Software skills: Internet-based software
Business skills: Financial planning
14-11 
 This project will develop your skills using Web-based software for searching for a home and calculating 
mortgage financing for that home.
You would like to purchase a home in Fort Collins, Colorado. Ideally, it should be a single-family 
house with at least three bedrooms and one bathroom that costs between $150,000 and $225,000 and finance 
it with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage. You can afford a down payment that is 20 percent of the value of the 
house. Before you purchase a house, you would like to find out what homes are available in your price 
range, find a mortgage, and determine the amount of your monthly payment. Use the Yahoo! Homes site to 
help you with the following tasks:
• Locate homes in Fort Collins, Colorado, that meet your specifications.
• Find a mortgage for 80 percent of the list price of the home. Compare rates from at least three sites 
(use search engines to find sites other than Yahoo).
• After selecting a mortgage, calculate your closing costs and the monthly payment.
When you are finished, evaluate the whole process. For example, assess the ease of use of the site 
and your ability to find information about houses and mortgages, the accuracy of the information you 
found, and the breadth of choice of homes and mortgages.
Collaboration and Teamwork Project
14-12 
 In MyMISLab, you will find a Collaboration and Teamwork Project dealing with the concepts in this 
 chapter. You will be able to use Google Drive, Google Sites, Google Docs, Google+, or other open source 
collaboration tools to complete the assignment.

A Shaky Start for Healthcare.gov
CASE STUDY
T
he administration of President Barack Obama 
has made Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act, often called “Obamacare”, its chief 
domestic accomplishment and the center-
piece of Obama’s legacy. Essential to Obama’s health 
care reform plan is Healthcare.gov, a health insurance 
exchange Web site that facilitates the sale of private 
health insurance plans to U.S. residents, assists people 
eligible to sign up for Medicaid, and has a separate 
marketplace for small businesses.
The site allows users to compare prices on health 
insurance plans in their states, to enroll in a plan 
they choose, and to find out if they qualify for gov-
ernment health care subsidies. Users must sign up 
and create their own specific account first, provid-
ing some personal information, in order to receive 
detailed information about available health care 
plans in their area.
Healthcare.gov was launched on October 1, 
2013, as promised, but visitors quickly encountered 
numerous technical problems. Software that assigned 
digital identities to enrollees and ensured that they 
saw only their own personal data was overwhelmed. 
Customers encountered cryptic error messages and 
could not log in to create accounts. There was insuf-
ficient computing capacity in the Herndon, Virginia, 
data center housing the system for the site. Many 
users received quotes that were incorrect because 
the feature used prices based on just two age groups.
It was estimated that only 1 percent of interested 
consumers were able to enroll through the site for 
the first week of operations, and many applications 
sent to insurers contained erroneous information. 
Thousands of enrollees for HealthCare.gov—at least 
one in five at the height of the problems—received 
inaccurate assignments to Medicaid or to private 
health plans. Some people were wrongly denied 
coverage.
Insurers received enrollment files from the federal 
exchange that were incomplete or inaccurate—as 
many as one in ten. The information includes who is 
enrolling and what subsidies they may receive. Some 
insurers reported being deluged with phone calls 
from people who believe they have signed up for a 
particular health plan, only to find that the company 
has no record of the enrollment. Enrollment prob-
lems with insurers persisted into November.
U.S. chief technology officer Todd Park stated on 
October 6 that Healthcare.gov’s glitches were caused 
by an unexpectedly high volume of users. About 
50,000–60,000 had been expected, but the site had to 
handle 250,000 simultaneous users. Over 8.1 million 
people visited Healthcare.gov between October 1 and 
October, 2013. 
White House officials later admitted that 
Healthcare.gov’s problems were not just caused by 
high traffic volume but also by software and system 
design issues. Stress tests performed by contractors a 
day before the launch date revealed the site slowed 
substantially with only 1,100 simultaneous users, far 
fewer than the 50,000–60,000 that were anticipated. 
Technical experts found out that the site was riddled 
with hardware and software defects, amounting to 
more than 600 items that needed to be fixed. 
A major contributor to these problems was the 
part of the system’s design that requires users to 
 create individual accounts before shopping for health 
insurance. This means that before users can shop 
for coverage, they must input personal data that 
are exchanged among separate computer systems 
built or run by multiple vendors, including CGI 
Group, developer of healthcare.gov, Quality Software 
Services, and credit-checker Experian PLC. If any 
part of this web of systems fails to work properly, 
users will be blocked from entering the exchange 
marketplace. A bottleneck had been created where 
these systems interacted with a software component 
called Oracle Identity Manager supplied by Oracle 
Corporation that was embedded in the government’s 
identity-checking system. Quality Software Services 
had subcontracted with Oracle for this part of the 
system. This problem might have been averted if the 
system allowed users to browse plans without first 
going through the complex registration process.
Problems persisted into the third week of opera-
tions, including pull-down menus that only worked 
intermittently and excruciatingly long wait times. 
For some weeks in October, the site was down 60 
percent of the time.
What happened to Healthcare.gov is another 
example of IT project management gone awry, 
which often happens with large technology  projects, 
especially those for the U.S. federal govern-
ment. There was no single leader overseeing the 
 
Chapter 14 Managing Projects 
601

Healthcare.gov implementation. The U.S. Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) coordinated 
the development effort. However, CMS had a siloed 
management structure, and no single unit was desig-
nated to take charge of the entire project. 
CMS parceled out the work for building and imple-
menting the Healthcare.gov system to a number of 
different outside contractors. The front end of the 
Web site (including the user interface) was devel-
oped by the startup Development Seed. The back 
end (where all the heavy-duty processing of enroll-
ment data and transactions with insurers takes place) 
was contracted to CGI Federal, a subsidiary of the 
Canadian multinational CGI Group, which received 
$231 million for the project. CGI then subcontracted 
much of its work to other companies. This is com-
mon in large government projects. Functions relating 
to digital identity authentication were contracted to 
Experian, the global information services company 
noted for its credit-checking expertise.
CMS set deadlines for the contractors, who were 
expected to attend meetings to hammer out the 
details of the specifications for the Web site. But the 
computer specialists skipped some of those sessions. 
Relations between CMS and its primary contractor 
CGI Federal had deteriorated in the months prior to 
the Healthcare.gov launch. Contractors for different 
parts of the system barely communicated with each 
other.
Some IT experts also criticized CMS’s decision 
to use database software from a company called 
MarkLogic, which handles data management dif-
ferently from more mainstream database manage-
ment systems from companies such as IBM and 
Oracle. Work proceeded more slowly because so few 
people were familiar with MarkLogic, and MarkLogic 
continued to perform below expectations after the 
Healthcare.gov Web site was launched. 
The Web site had not been thoroughly tested 
before it went live, so a number of software and 
hardware defects had not been detected. Testing of 
the system by insurers had been scheduled for July 
but didn’t begin until the third week in September.
CMS was responsible for testing the system during 
the final weeks, not its software developers. Usually 
software developers handle the portion of the testing 
for identifying remaining problems before users see 
the final product.
Fixing the account creation software exposed 
other problems. As few as 500 users could cripple the 
system.
Technology experts also faulted Healthcare.gov’s 
developers for trying to go live with all parts of a 
large and very complex system all at once. It would 
have been better to roll out system functions gradu-
ally. CGI believed that a full-function Healthcare.
gov with all the anticipated bells and whistles was 
an unrealistic target. Given the time required to 
complete and test the software, it was impossible to 
launch a full-function exchange by Oct. 1. But gov-
ernment officials insisted that Oct. 1 was not nego-
tiable and had become impatient with CGI’s pattern 
of excuses for missed deadlines. The Obama admin-
istration kept on modifying regulations and policies 
until the summer of 2013, which meant that con-
tractors had to deal with changing requirements.
The Healthcare.gov enrollment system is very 
complex. It connects to other federal computer net-
works, including SSA, IRS, VA, Office of Personnel 
Management, and the Peace Corps. It has to verify a 
considerable amount of personal information, includ-
ing income and immigration status.
Vital components were never secured. There was 
insufficient access to a data center to prevent the 
Web site from crashing. No backup system for a Web 
site crash was created. The interaction between the 
data center where the information is stored and the 
system was so poorly configured that it had to be 
redesigned. 
CMS had several warnings between March and 
July that the project was going off-track, but didn’t 
seek deep White House involvement or change the 
leadership structure, according to officials, congres-
sional aides and e-mails from the period. An admin-
istration report noted that inadequate management 
oversight and coordination among technical teams 
prevented real-time decision making and efficient 
responses to address the issues with the site. The 
House Energy and Commerce Committee, which 
had been investigating Healthcare.gov, found no 
evidence of extensive communication between 
CMS and the White House even in July, when CMS 
 technology official Henry Chao expressed serious 
concern about the project.
In March, a White House Web site that tracks 
the status of major government technology 
 projects labeled the project high risk. Officials 
attributed the downgrade to a lag in submit-
ting information, and the project’s status was 
upgraded the following month. The consulting 
firm McKinsey & Co. detailed the project’s poten-
tial risks in a presentation between March 28 and 
April 8 to the top CMS official, Marilyn Tavenner, 
to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen 
Sebelius, and to White House Chief Technology 
Officer Todd Park.
602 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

The McKinsey report anticipated many of the site’s 
pitfalls and urged the administration to name a single 
project leader to streamline decision-making. It also 
emphasized the importance of White House support 
for CMS to meet the Oct. 1 launch date. But according 
to documents from the period and officials, the White 
House’s minimal involvement in the project’s details 
didn’t change after the McKinsey report.
By July, CMS officials were growing alarmed about 
the project’s status, including a shortage of staff to 
address the ever-mounting list of problems. They 
brought more personnel on board while bickering 
with contractors over the distribution of resources. 
But the depth of the website’s difficulties still didn’t 
become apparent until weeks after the Oct. 1 launch.
The White House assembled experts from 
 government and industry who worked franti-
cally to fix the system. The Obama administration 
appointed contractor Quality Software Services Inc. 
(QSSI) to coordinate the work involved in fixing 
the Web site. QSSI had worked earlier on the Web 
site’s back-end. Former deputy director of the Office 
of Management and Budget Jeffrey Zients was 
appointed to act as the adviser to CMS. In January 
2014, Accenture replaced CGI Group as the Web 
site’s lead contractor.
Work on fixing the Web site continued through 
October and November 2013, and the Web site 
appeared to be working more smoothly. For the vast 
majority of users, Healthcare.gov was working more 
than 90 percent of the time. Response time (the 
time required for a Web page to load) was reduced 
from 8 seconds to less than one. The incidence of 
error messages preventing people from using the 
site went from 6 percent down to .75 percent. But on 
November 13, the Obama administration revealed 
that less than 27,000 people had signed up for pri-
vate health insurance using Healthcare.gov. Only 
137,000 people had done so by November 30. These 
enrollment numbers were well below what the gov-
ernment had forecast. Healthcare.gov also forced 
the Obama administration to delay by one year an 
online exchange for small business.
A spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services said on Nov. 19 that the govern-
ment had fixed “two-thirds of the high-priority bugs” 
that were responsible for inaccuracies in enrollment 
data. Mr. Chao said the government was still working 
on “back office systems,” including those needed to 
pay insurance companies.
Reuters reported in mid-October 2013, that the total 
cost of building Healthcare.gov using  contractors had 
tripled from an initial estimate of $93.7 million to 
about $292 million. Overall cost for building the Web 
site reached $500 million by October 2013.
By early 2014, Healthcare.gov was working much 
better, but was not problem-free. The Healthcare.
gov site went down shortly after midnight March 30, 
2014 and remained unusable until about 7:45 a.m. 
the following morning. It then experienced another 
problem around noon that same day that prevented 
new users from creating accounts, while some 
people who already had accounts were unable to log 
in. Some of the hundreds of thousands of Americans 
trying to sign up for health care at the last minute of 
the enrollment period were unable to do so. Obama 
administration officials nevertheless remained con-
fident that they would reach their initial target of 
seven million health insurance signups by the March 
31, 2014 deadline.
On July 30, 2014 the U.S. Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) released a non-partisan 
study finding that the Healthcare.gov Web site was 
developed without effective planning or oversight 
practices. Kathleen Sibelius resigned as Secretary for 
Health and Human Services on April 10, 2014 and 
was replaced by Sylvia Mathews Burwell on June 9 
of that year.

’Oréal Group is the world’s largest cosmetics and beauty company, 
and it is a truly global brand. Virtually everyone has heard of this 
company or used its products, with world-name brands including 
L’Oréal Paris and Maybelline (mass-market), Lancôme (luxury), 
Redken and SoftSheen-Carson (retail and salon), and The Body Shop  natural 
cosmetics. Altogether L’Oréal has more than 28 global brands in 130 countries 
and more than 77,000 employees. This is a very challenging company to man-
age worldwide.
Each of L’Oréal’s 40 manufacturing sites deals with hundreds or even thou-
sands of different recipes for L’Oréal products. Every recipe must be followed 
exactly, and every ingredient must be tested for quality. This level of complex-
ity increases the chances of human error and waste. L’Oréal’s management 
believed the company needed to do more to ensure that its products are all 
manufactured worldwide under uniform production and quality standards.
L’Oréal’s various operating units in different regions and countries were run-
ning their own versions of SAP enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. In 
order to achieve the goal of global product uniformity, these disparate systems 
had to be standardized and consolidated. It was hoped that productivity, qual-
ity, and safety would be improved by standardizing  best-practice processes 
throughout the company.
Management knew that this level of organizational change required changes 
in employee behavior, and it dedicated significant resources to change manage-
ment and promoting  knowledge-sharing across geographical and cultural 
boundaries. The company assigned a  business “owner” for each core business 
L’ORÉAL’S GLOBAL MAKEOVER

process who would help analyze the processes at each site and implement the 
necessary changes. L’Oréal’s information systems team would then  create the 
system design and implementation plan for the solution. 
L’Oréal was able to implement a single global instance of SAP’s ERP system 
and integrate that with Apriso’s FlexNet for operations management using a core 
model that is replicated at each site. FlexNet is a unified suite of manufacturing 
software applications for coordinating all manufacturing operations—within the 
plant, between plants, and across a company’s  supply chain and enterprise. 
L’Oréal named its new system ISIS, standing for Integrated Solution for Industrial 
Systems. L’Oréal’s transactional processes, financial controls, and purchasing are 
all integrated into the FlexNet manufacturing operations system on the shop 
floor run. L’Oréal runs ISIS at its central data center in Montpellier, France, 
where it keeps the master data for the business. FlexNet runs on servers in indi-
vidual factories so that operations can  continue if there is a problem with 
L’Oréal’s main servers. 
ISIS guides factory operators through each recipe for a product and automati-
cally records the weight of each ingredient to ensure exact quantities are being 
used. All ingredients are tested, and raw materials that have passed tests for 
quality are given labels that must be scanned by the worker before being added 
to the recipe. In the past, shop workers used to rummage around for informa-
tion on recipes or raw materials. The labels also provide forklift drivers with 
directions on which materials need to be taken to the packaging station. 
With this level of centralization and global processes, L’Oréal is able to 
 implement new processes and related systems changes globally much more 
 rapidly than in the past. For example, when the company had multiple versions 
of SAP running in different operating units, it could take two to five years for the 
entire company to upgrade to the latest version of the software. With its global 
enterprise-wide version of SAP and FlexNet, a recent L’Oréal’s upgrade took just 
one weekend. That means that the company can easily update its  systems 
 without disrupting its factories, and bring new factories on board much more 
quickly. For example, a recently acquired Yves St. Laurent factory was integrated 
with L’Oréal’s global quality assurance, safety, and  efficiency  practices within a 
few months. However, there is still some flexibility in the  system to  tailor some 
processes to local needs if necessary.
L’Oréal management believes the company’s overall capacity has increased 
and that the workplace is more productive and efficient. Shop workers have 
asserted that the system is easy to use and has reduced confusion and stress. 
Fewer materials are wasted, there are fewer discrepancies between actual  versus 
planned production, and the company is able to maintain lower, better managed 
inventories.

L
’Oréal’s efforts to create global manufacturing systems identify some of 
the issues that truly global organizations need to consider if they want to 
operate worldwide. Like many large, multinational firms, L’Oréal has numerous 
operating units in many different countries. Even though these units were 
 running SAP ERP software, they used their own versions and  business  processes. 
As a result, L’Oréal was unable to effectively coordinate global  manufacturing 
 operations or ensure that its vast array of products met global quality and 
 production standards.

15.1 WHAT MAJOR FACTORS ARE DRIVING THE 
INTERNATIONALIZATION OF BUSINESS?
I
n earlier chapters, we describe the emergence of a global economic system 
and global world order driven by advanced networks and  information 
 systems. The new world order is sweeping away many national 
 corporations, national industries, and national economies controlled by 
domestic politicians. Many localized firms will be replaced by fast-moving 
 networked corporations that transcend national boundaries. The growth of 
international trade has radically altered domestic economies around the globe.
Consider the path to market for an iPhone, which is illustrated in Figure 15.1. 
The iPhone was designed by Apple engineers in the United States, sourced 
with more than 100 high-tech components from around the world, and assem-
bled in China. Among the iPhone 5’s major suppliers, Samsung Electronics in 
South Korea has supplied the applications processor. The iPhone 5’s accelera-
tor and gyroscope are made in Italy and France by STMicroelectronics, and its 
 electronic compass is made by AKM Semiconductor in Japan. Germany’s Dialog 
Semiconductor designed chips for power management. Texas Instruments (TI) 
and Broadcom in the United States supply the touch screen controller, Japan’s 
The chapter-opening diagram calls attention to important points raised by 
this case and this chapter. To solve its global management and business 
 challenges, L’Oréal had all of its business units adopt a standard core version of 
SAP software and standard manufacturing and production processes. The ERP 
system was integrated with the FlexNet manufacturing software suite to 
 coordinate manufacturing operations on a global scale. Management realized 
that this level of organizational change required careful attention to change 
management. Although L’Oréal now has standard global manufacturing and 
production systems and business processes, it is sensitive to local differences 
and gives units some leeway to tailor processes to local needs. 
Here are some questions to think about: How did information technology 
improve operations at L’Oréal? Why did management think it desirable to cen-
tralize its systems by developing a single ERP system across all its operational 
units?

DEVELOPING AN INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
This chapter describes how to go about building an international information 
systems architecture suitable for your international strategy. An international 
information systems architecture consists of the basic information  systems 
required by organizations to coordinate worldwide trade and other activi-
ties. Figure 15.2 illustrates the reasoning we follow throughout the  chapter 
and depicts the major dimensions of an international information systems 
architecture.
The basic strategy to follow when building an international system is to 
understand the global environment in which your firm is operating. This 
means understanding the overall market forces, or business drivers, that are 
pushing your industry toward global competition. A business driver is a force 
in the environment to which businesses must respond and that  influences 
the direction of the business. Likewise, examine carefully the inhibitors or 
 negative factors that create management challenges—factors that could scuttle 
the  development of a global business. Once you have examined the global 
 environment, you will need to consider a corporate strategy for competing in 
that environment. How will your firm respond? You could ignore the global 
market and focus on domestic competition only, sell to the globe from a domestic 
base, or organize production and distribution around the globe. There are many
in-between choices.
After you have developed a strategy, it is time to consider how to structure 
your organization so it can pursue the strategy. How will you accomplish a 
division of labor across a global environment? Where will production, admin-
istration, accounting, marketing, and human resource functions be located?
Who will handle the systems function?

Italy, France, and South Korea for other parts. Final assembly occurs in China.
610 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

Next, you must consider the management issues in implementing your 
 strategy and making the organization design come alive. Key here will be the 
design of business processes. How can you discover and manage user require-
ments? How can you induce change in local units to conform to international 
requirements? How can you reengineer on a global scale, and how can you 
coordinate systems development?
The last issue to consider is the technology platform. Although changing 
technology is a key driving factor leading toward global markets, you need to 
have a corporate strategy and structure before you can rationally choose the 
right technology.
After you have completed this process of reasoning, you will be well on your 
way toward an appropriate international information systems portfolio capable 
of achieving your corporate goals. Let’s begin by looking at the overall global 
environment.
THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT: BUSINESS DRIVERS AND 
CHALLENGES
Table 15.1 lists the business drivers in the global environment that are leading 
all industries toward global markets and competition.
The global business drivers can be divided into two groups: general cultural 
factors and specific business factors. Easily recognized general cultural factors 
have driven internationalization since World War II. Information, communi-
cation, and transportation technologies have created a global village in which 
 communication (by telephone, television, radio, or computer network) around 
the globe is no more difficult and not much more expensive than communi-
cation down the block. The cost of moving goods and services to and from 
 geographically dispersed locations has fallen dramatically.
The development of global communications has created a global village 
in a second sense: A global culture created by television, the Internet, and 
 FIGURE 15.2  INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
The major dimensions for developing an international information systems architecture are the global 
environment, the corporate global strategies, the structure of the organization, the management and 
business processes, and the technology platform.
 
Chapter 15 Managing Global Systems 
611

other globally shared media such as movies now permits different cultures and 
peoples to develop common expectations about right and wrong, desirable and 
undesirable, heroic and cowardly. The collapse of the Eastern bloc has acceler-
ated the growth of a world culture enormously, increased support for  capitalism 
and business, and reduced the level of cultural conflict in Europe considerably.
A last factor to consider is the growth of a global knowledge base. At the 
end of World War II, knowledge, education, science, and industrial skills were 
highly concentrated in North America, western Europe, and Japan, with the 
rest of the world euphemistically called the Third World. This is no longer true. 
Latin America, China, India, southern Asia, and eastern Europe have devel-
oped  powerful educational, industrial, and scientific centers, resulting in a 
much more democratically and widely dispersed knowledge base.
These general cultural factors leading toward internationalization result in 
specific business globalization factors that affect most industries. The growth 
of powerful communications technologies and the emergence of world cultures 
lay the groundwork for global markets—global consumers  interested in consum-
ing similar products that are culturally approved. Coca-Cola, American sneak-
ers (made in Korea but designed in Los Angeles), and Cable News Network 
(CNN) programming can now be sold in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
Responding to this demand, global production and operations have emerged 
with precise online coordination between far-flung production facilities and 
 central headquarters thousands of miles away. At SeaLand Transportation, 
a major global shipping company based in Newark, New Jersey, shipping 
 managers in Newark can watch the loading of ships in Rotterdam online, check 
trim and ballast, and trace packages to specific ship locations as the activity 
 proceeds. This is all possible through an international satellite link.
The new global markets and pressure toward global production and operation 
have called forth whole new capabilities for global coordination. Production, 
accounting, marketing and sales, human resources, and systems development 
(all the major business functions) can be coordinated on a global scale.
Frito Lay, for instance, can develop a marketing sales force automa-
tion system in the United States and, once provided, may try the same 
 techniques and technologies in Spain. Micromarketing—marketing to very 
small  geographic and social units—no longer means marketing to neigh-
borhoods in the United States, but to neighborhoods throughout the world! 
Internet-based marketing means marketing to individuals and social net-
works through out the world. These new levels of global coordination permit 
for the first time in history the location of business activity according to 
comparative advantage. Design should be located where it is best accom-
plished, as should marketing,  production, and finance.

612 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

Finally, global markets, production, and administration create the conditions 
for powerful, sustained global economies of scale. Production driven by world-
wide global demand can be concentrated where it can best be accomplished, fixed 
resources can be allocated over larger production runs, and production runs in 
larger plants can be scheduled more efficiently and precisely estimated. Lower-
cost factors of production can be exploited wherever they emerge. The result is 
a powerful strategic advantage to firms that can organize globally. These general 
and specific business drivers have greatly enlarged world trade and commerce.
Not all industries are similarly affected by these trends. Clearly, manufactur-
ing has been much more affected than services that still tend to be  domestic 
and highly inefficient. However, the localism of services is breaking down 
in telecommunications, entertainment, transportation, finance, law, and 
 general business. Clearly, those firms within an industry that can understand 
the  internationalization of the industry and respond appropriately will reap 
 enormous gains in productivity and stability.
Business Challenges
Although the possibilities of globalization for business success are  significant, 
fundamental forces are operating to inhibit a global economy and to  disrupt 
international business. Table 15.2 lists the most common and powerful 
 challenges to the development of global systems.
At a cultural level, particularism, making judgments and taking action on 
the basis of narrow or personal characteristics, in all its forms (religious, nation-
alistic, ethnic, regionalism, geopolitical position) rejects the very concept of a 
shared global culture and rejects the penetration of domestic markets by  foreign 
goods and services. Differences among cultures produce differences in social 
expectations, politics, and ultimately legal rules. In certain countries, such as 
the United States, consumers expect domestic name-brand products to be built 
domestically and are disappointed to learn that much of what they thought of 
as domestically produced is in fact foreign made.
Different cultures produce different political regimes. Among the many 
 different countries of the world are different laws governing the movement 
of information, information privacy of their citizens, origins of software and 
 hardware in systems, and radio and satellite telecommunications. Even the 
hours of business and the terms of business trade vary greatly across political 
cultures. These different legal regimes complicate global business and must be 
considered when building global systems.

Chapter 15 Managing Global Systems 
613

For instance, European countries have very strict laws concerning transbor-
der data flow and privacy. Transborder data flow is defined as the movement 
of information across international boundaries in any form. Some European 
countries prohibit the processing of financial information outside their 
 boundaries or the movement of personal information to foreign countries. The 
European Union Data Protection Directive, which went into effect in October 
1998, restricts the flow of any information to countries (such as the United 
States) that do not meet strict European information laws on personal informa-
tion. Financial services, travel, and health care companies are often directly 
affected. In response, most multinational firms develop information systems 
within each European country to avoid the cost and uncertainty of moving 
information across national boundaries.
Cultural and political differences profoundly affect organizations’ business 
processes and applications of information technology. A host of specific  barriers 
arise from the general cultural differences, everything from different reliability 
of phone networks to the shortage of skilled consultants.
National laws and traditions have created disparate accounting practices 
in various countries, which impact the ways profits and losses are analyzed. 
German companies generally do not recognize the profit from a venture until 
the project is completely finished and they have been paid. Conversely, British 
firms begin posting profits before a project is completed, when they are reason-
ably certain they will get the money.
These accounting practices are tightly intertwined with each country’s legal 
system, business philosophy, and tax code. British, U.S., and Dutch firms share 
a predominantly Anglo-Saxon outlook that separates tax calculations from 
reports to shareholders to focus on showing shareholders how fast profits are 
growing. Continental European accounting practices are less oriented toward 
impressing investors, focusing rather on demonstrating compliance with strict 
rules and minimizing tax liabilities. These diverging accounting practices make 
it difficult for large international companies with units in different countries to 
evaluate their performance.
Language remains a significant barrier. Although English has become a kind 
of standard business language, this is truer at higher levels of companies and 
not throughout the middle and lower ranks. Software may have to be built with 
local language interfaces before a new information system can be successfully 
implemented.
Currency fluctuations can play havoc with planning models and projections. 
A product that appears profitable in Mexico or Japan may actually produce a 
loss because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
These inhibiting factors must be taken into account when you are 
designing and building international systems for your business. For example, 
companies trying to implement “lean production” systems spanning national 
boundaries typically underestimate the time, expense, and logistical 
difficulties of making goods and information flow freely across different 
countries.
STATE OF THE ART
One might think, given the opportunities for achieving competitive  advantages 
as outlined previously and the interest in future applications, that most 
 international companies have rationally developed marvelous international 
systems architectures. Nothing could be further from the truth. Most compa-
nies have inherited patchwork international systems from the distant past, 
614 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

often based on concepts of information processing developed in the 1960s—
batch- oriented reporting from independent foreign divisions to corporate head-
quarters, manual entry of data from one legacy system to another, with little 
online control and communication. Corporations in this situation increasingly 
face powerful competitive challenges in the marketplace from firms that have 
 rationally designed truly international systems. Still other companies have 
recently built technology platforms for international systems but have nowhere 
to go because they lack global strategy.
As it turns out, there are significant difficulties in building appropri-
ate  international architectures. The difficulties involve planning a system 
 appropriate to the firm’s global strategy, structuring the organization of  systems 
and business units, solving implementation issues, and choosing the right 
 technical platform. Let’s examine these problems in greater detail.
15.2 WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR 
DEVELOPING GLOBAL BUSINESSES?
Three organizational issues face corporations seeking a global position:  choosing 
a strategy, organizing the business, and organizing the systems management 
area. The first two are closely connected, so we discuss them together.
GLOBAL STRATEGIES AND BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
Four main global strategies form the basis for global firms’ organizational 
 structure. These are domestic exporter, multinational, franchiser, and 
 transnational. Each of these strategies is pursued with a specific business 
 organizational structure (see Table 15.3). For simplicity’s sake, we describe three 
kinds of organizational structure or governance: centralized (in the home coun-
try), decentralized (to local foreign units), and coordinated (all units  participate 
as equals). Other types of governance patterns can be observed in specific 
 companies (e.g., authoritarian dominance by one unit, a confederacy of equals, 
a federal structure balancing power among strategic units, and so forth).
The domestic exporter strategy is characterized by heavy centralization 
of corporate activities in the home country of origin. Nearly all international 
 companies begin this way, and some move on to other forms. Production, 
finance/accounting, sales/marketing, human resources, and strategic 
 management are set up to optimize resources in the home country. International 
sales are  sometimes dispersed using agency agreements or  subsidiaries, but

even here, foreign marketing relies on the domestic home base for market-
ing themes and strategies. Caterpillar Corporation and other heavy capital- 
equipment  manufacturers fall into this category of firm.
The multinational strategy concentrates financial management and  control 
out of a central home base while decentralizing production, sales, and market-
ing operations to units in other countries. The products and services on sale in 
different countries are adapted to suit local market conditions. The organiza-
tion becomes a far-flung confederation of production and marketing facilities in 
different countries. Many financial service firms, along with a host of manufac-
turers, such as General Motors, Chrysler, and Intel, fit this pattern.
Franchisers are an interesting mix of old and new. On the one hand, the 
product is created, designed, financed, and initially produced in the home coun-
try, but for product-specific reasons must rely heavily on foreign personnel for 
further production, marketing, and human resources. Food franchisers such as 
McDonald’s, Mrs. Fields Cookies, and KFC fit this pattern. McDonald’s created 
a new form of fast-food chain in the United States and continues to rely largely 
on the United States for inspiration of new products, strategic management, 
and financing. Nevertheless, because the product must be produced locally—it 
is perishable—extensive coordination and dispersal of production, local market-
ing, and local recruitment of personnel are required.
Generally, foreign franchisees are clones of the mother country units, but 
fully coordinated worldwide production that could optimize factors of produc-
tion is not possible. For instance, potatoes and beef can generally not be bought 
where they are cheapest on world markets but must be produced reasonably 
close to the area of consumption.
Transnational firms are the stateless, truly globally managed firms that may 
represent a larger part of international business in the future. Transnational 
firms have no single national headquarters but instead have many regional 
headquarters and perhaps a world headquarters. In a transnational strat-
egy, nearly all the value-adding activities are managed from a global perspec-
tive without reference to national borders, optimizing sources of supply and 
demand wherever they appear, and taking advantage of any local competitive 
advantages. Transnational firms take the globe, not the home country, as their 
management frame of reference. The governance of these firms has been 
likened to a federal structure in which there is a strong central management 
core of decision making, but considerable dispersal of power and financial 
muscle throughout the global divisions. Few companies have  actually attained 
transnational status.
Information technology and improvements in global telecommunications 
are giving international firms more flexibility to shape their global strategies. 
Protectionism and a need to serve local markets better encourage companies 
to disperse production facilities and at least become multinational. At the same 
time, the drive to achieve economies of scale and take advantage of short-term 
local advantage moves transnationals toward a global management perspec-
tive and a concentration of power and authority. Hence, there are forces of 
decentralization and dispersal, as well as forces of centralization and global 
coordination.
GLOBAL SYSTEMS TO FIT THE STRATEGY
Information technology and improvements in global telecommunications are 
giving international firms more flexibility to shape their global strategies. The 
configuration, management, and development of systems tend to follow the 
616 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

global strategy chosen. Figure 15.3 depicts the typical arrangements. By sys-
tems we mean the full range of activities involved in building and operating 
information systems: conception and alignment with the strategic business 
plan, systems development, and ongoing operation and maintenance. For the 
sake of simplicity, we consider four types of systems configuration. Centralized 
 systems are those in which systems development and operation occur totally at 
the domestic home base. Duplicated systems are those in which development 
occurs at the home base but operations are handed over to autonomous units 
in foreign locations. Decentralized systems are those in which each foreign unit 
designs its own unique solutions and systems. Networked systems are those in 
which systems development and operations occur in an integrated and coordi-
nated fashion across all units.
As can be seen in Figure 15.3, domestic exporters tend to have highly 
 centralized systems in which a single domestic systems development staff 
develops worldwide applications. Multinationals offer a direct and striking 
 contrast: Here, foreign units devise their own systems solutions based on 
local needs with few if any applications in common with headquarters (the 
exceptions being financial reporting and some telecommunications applica-
tions). Franchisers have the simplest systems structure: Like the products they 
sell, franchisers develop a single system usually at the home base and then 
 replicate it around the world. Each unit, no matter where it is located, has 
identical applications. Last, the most ambitious form of systems development 
is found in transnational firms: Networked systems are those in which there 
is a solid,  singular global environment for developing and operating  systems. 
This  usually presupposes a powerful telecommunications backbone, a culture 
of shared applications development, and a shared management culture that 
crosses  cultural barriers. The networked systems structure is the most visible in 
financial services where the homogeneity of the product—money and money 
instruments—seems to overcome cultural barriers.
REORGANIZING THE BUSINESS
How should a firm organize itself for doing business on an international scale? 
To develop a global company and information systems support structure, a firm 
needs to follow these principles:
 FIGURE 15.3 GLOBAL STRATEGY AND SYSTEMS CONFIGURATIONS
The large Xs show the dominant patterns, and the small Xs show the emerging patterns. For instance, 
domestic exporters rely predominantly on centralized systems, but there is continual pressure and 
some development of decentralized systems in local marketing regions.
 
Chapter 15 Managing Global Systems 
617

1. Organize value-adding activities along lines of comparative advantage.
For instance, marketing/sales functions should be located where they can best 
be performed, for least cost and maximum impact; likewise with production, 
finance, human resources, and information systems.
2. Develop and operate systems units at each level of corporate activity—
regional, national, and international. To serve local needs, there should be 
host country systems units of some magnitude. Regional systems units should 
handle  telecommunications and systems development across national bound-
aries that take place within major geographic regions (European, Asian, 
American). Transnational systems units should be established to create the 
linkages across major regional areas and coordinate the development and 
operation of  international telecommunications and systems development 
(Roche, 1992).
3. Establish at world headquarters a single office responsible for development of 
international systems—a global chief information officer (CIO) position.
Many successful companies have devised organizational systems  structures 
along these principles. The success of these companies relies not only on the 
proper organization of activities, but also on a key ingredient—a  management 
team that can understand the risks and benefits of international systems and that 
can devise strategies for overcoming the risks. We turn to these  management 
topics next.
15.3 WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES POSED BY GLOBAL 
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND MANAGEMENT 
SOLUTIONS FOR THESE CHALLENGES?
Table 15.4 lists the principal management problems posed by developing 
 international systems. It is interesting to note that these problems are the chief 
difficulties managers experience in developing ordinary domestic systems as 
well. But these are enormously complicated in the international environment.
A TYPICAL SCENARIO: DISORGANIZATION ON A 
GLOBAL SCALE
Let’s look at a common scenario. A traditional multinational consumer-goods 
company based in the United States and operating in Europe would like to 
expand into Asian markets and knows that it must develop a transnational strat-
egy and a supportive information systems structure. Like most multinationals, it

has dispersed production and marketing to regional and national centers while 
maintaining a world headquarters and strategic management in the United 
States. Historically, it has allowed each of the subsidiary foreign divisions to 
develop its own systems. The only centrally coordinated system is financial 
controls and reporting. The central systems group in the United States focuses 
only on domestic functions and production.
The result is a hodgepodge of hardware, software, and telecommunications. 
The e-mail systems between Europe and the United States are  incompatible. 
Each production facility uses a different manufacturing resources  planning 
system (or a different version of the same ERP system), and different  marketing, 
sales, and human resource systems. Hardware and database  platforms are wildly 
different. Communications between different sites are poor, given the high cost 
of European intercountry communications. The  central  systems group at head-
quarters in the United States recently was  decimated and dispersed to the U.S. 
local sites in the hope of serving local needs better and reducing costs.
What do you recommend to the senior management leaders of this 
 company, who now want to pursue a transnational strategy and develop 
an information systems architecture to support a highly coordinated global 
systems environment? Consider the problems you face by reexamining
Table 15.4. The foreign divisions will resist efforts to agree on common user 
requirements; they have never thought about much other than their own 
units’ needs. The systems groups in American local sites, which have been 
enlarged recently and told to focus on local needs, will not easily accept guid-
ance from anyone recommending a transnational strategy. It will be difficult 
to convince local managers anywhere in the world that they should change 
their business procedures to align with other units in the world, especially if 
this might  interfere with their local performance. After all, local managers 
are rewarded in this company for meeting local objectives of their division 
or plant. Finally, it will be difficult to coordinate development of projects 
around the world in the absence of a powerful telecommunications network 
and, therefore, difficult to encourage local users to take on ownership in the 
systems developed.
GLOBAL SYSTEMS STRATEGY
Figure 15.4 lays out the main dimensions of a solution. First, consider that 
not all systems should be coordinated on a transnational basis; only some 
core systems are truly worth sharing from a cost and feasibility point of view. 
Core systems support functions that are absolutely critical to the organiza-
tion. Other systems should be partially coordinated because they share key 
elements, but they do not have to be totally common across national boundar-
ies. For such systems, a good deal of local variation is possible and desirable.
A final group of systems is peripheral, truly provincial, and needed to suit local 
requirements only.
Define the Core Business Processes
How do you identify core systems? The first step is to define a short list of 
 critical core business processes. Business processes are defined and described 
in Chapter 2, which you should review. Briefly, business processes are sets of 
logically related tasks to produce specific business results, such as shipping out 
correct orders to customers or delivering innovative products to the market. 
Each business process typically involves many functional areas, communicat-
ing and coordinating work, information, and knowledge.
 
Chapter 15 Managing Global Systems 
619

The way to identify these core business processes is to conduct a business 
process analysis. How are customer orders taken, what happens to them once 
they are taken, who fills the orders, and how are they shipped to the customers? 
What about suppliers? Do they have access to manufacturing resource  planning 
systems so that supply is automatic? You should be able to identify and set 
 priorities in a short list of ten business processes that are absolutely critical for 
the firm.
Next, can you identify centers of excellence for these processes? Is the 
 customer order fulfillment superior in the United States, manufacturing 
 process control superior in Germany, and human resources superior in Asia? 
You should be able to identify some areas of the company, for some lines of 
 business, where a division or unit stands out in the performance of one or 
 several business functions.
When you understand the business processes of a firm, you can  rank-order 
them. You then can decide which processes should be core applications, 
centrally coordinated, designed, and implemented around the globe,
and which should be regional and local. At the same time, by identifying
the critical business processes, the really important ones, you have gone a long 
way to defining a vision of the future that you should be working toward.
Identify the Core Systems to Coordinate Centrally
By identifying the critical core business processes, you begin to see opportu-
nities for transnational systems. The second strategic step is to conquer the 
 FIGURE 15.4 LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND GLOBAL SYSTEMS
Agency and other coordination costs increase as the firm moves from local option systems toward 
regional and global systems. However, transaction costs of participating in global markets probably 
decrease as firms develop global systems. A sensible strategy is to reduce agency costs by developing 
only a few core global systems that are vital for global operations, leaving other systems in the hands 
of regional and local units.

core systems and define these systems as truly transnational. The financial 
and political costs of defining and implementing transnational systems are 
extremely high. Therefore, keep the list to an absolute minimum, letting 
 experience be the guide and erring on the side of minimalism. By dividing 
off a small group of systems as absolutely critical, you divide opposition to a 
 transnational  strategy. At the same time, you can appease those who oppose the 
central worldwide coordination implied by transnational systems by  permitting 
peripheral  systems development to progress unabated, with the exception of 
some technical platform requirements.
Choose an Approach: Incremental, Grand Design, Evolutionary
A third step is to choose an approach. Avoid piecemeal approaches. These 
surely will fail for lack of visibility, opposition from all who stand to lose 
from transnational development, and lack of power to convince senior 
 management that the transnational systems are worth it. Likewise, avoid 
grand design approaches that try to do everything at once. These also tend 
to fail, because of an inability to focus resources. Nothing gets done properly, 
and opposition to organizational change is needlessly strengthened because 
the effort requires huge resources. An alternative approach is to evolve trans-
national applications incrementally from existing applications with a precise 
and clear vision of the transnational capabilities the organization should have 
in five years. This is sometimes referred to as the “salami strategy,” or one 
slice at a time.
Make the Benefits Clear
What is in it for the company? One of the worst situations to avoid is to build 
global systems for the sake of building global systems. From the beginning, it 
is crucial that senior management at headquarters and foreign division manag-
ers clearly understand the benefits that will come to the company as well as to 
individual units. Although each system offers unique benefits to a particular 
budget, the overall contribution of global systems lies in four areas.
Global systems—truly integrated, distributed, and transnational systems—
contribute to superior management and coordination. A simple price tag cannot 
be put on the value of this contribution, and the benefit will not show up in any 
capital budgeting model. It is the ability to switch suppliers on a moment’s 
notice from one region to another in a crisis, the ability to move production 
in response to natural disasters, and the ability to use excess capacity in one 
region to meet raging demand in another.
A second major contribution is vast improvement in production, operation, 
and supply and distribution. Imagine a global value chain, with global suppliers 
and a global distribution network. For the first time, senior managers can locate 
value-adding activities in regions where they are most economically performed.
Third, global systems mean global customers and global marketing. Fixed 
costs around the world can be amortized over a much larger customer base. 
This will unleash new economies of scale at production facilities.
Last, global systems mean the ability to optimize the use of corporate funds 
over a much larger capital base. This means, for instance, that capital in a 
 surplus region can be moved efficiently to expand production of capital-starved 
regions; that cash can be managed more effectively within the company and 
put to use more effectively.
These strategies will not by themselves create global systems. You will have 
to implement what you strategize.
 
Chapter 15 Managing Global Systems 
621

THE MANAGEMENT SOLUTION: IMPLEMENTATION
We now can reconsider how to handle the most vexing problems facing 
 managers developing the global information systems architectures that were 
described in Table 15.4.
Agreeing on Common User Requirements
Establishing a short list of the core business processes and core support  systems 
will begin a process of rational comparison across the many divisions of 
the company, develop a common language for discussing the business, and 
 naturally lead to an understanding of common elements (as well as the unique 
qualities that must remain local).
Introducing Changes in Business Processes
Your success as a change agent will depend on your legitimacy, your authority, 
and your ability to involve users in the change design process. Legitimacy is 
defined as the extent to which your authority is accepted on grounds of com-
petence, vision, or other qualities. The selection of a viable change strategy, 
which we have defined as evolutionary but with a vision, should assist you in 
convincing others that change is feasible and desirable. Involving people in 
change, assuring them that change is in the best interests of the company and 
their local units, is a key tactic.
Coordinating Applications Development
Choice of change strategy is critical for this problem. At the global level there 
is far too much complexity to attempt a grand design strategy of change. It is 
far easier to coordinate change by making small incremental steps toward a 
larger vision. Imagine a five-year plan of action rather than a two-year plan 
of action, and reduce the set of transnational systems to a bare minimum to 
reduce  coordination costs.
Coordinating Software Releases
Firms can institute procedures to ensure that all operating units convert to new 
software updates at the same time so that everyone’s software is compatible.
Encouraging Local Users to Support Global Systems
The key to this problem is to involve users in the creation of the design without 
giving up control over the development of the project to parochial interests. 
The overall tactic for dealing with resistant local units in a transnational com-
pany is cooptation. Cooptation is defined as bringing the opposition into the 
process of designing and implementing the solution without giving up control 
over the direction and nature of the change. As much as possible, raw power 
should be avoided. Minimally, however, local units must agree on a short list of 
transnational systems, and raw power may be required to solidify the idea that 
transnational systems of some sort are truly required.
How should cooptation proceed? Several alternatives are possible. One alter-
native is to permit each country unit the opportunity to develop one transna-
tional application first in its home territory, and then throughout the world. In 
this manner, each major country systems group is given a piece of the action 
in developing a transnational system, and local units feel a sense of owner-
ship in the transnational effort. On the downside, this assumes the ability to 
develop high-quality systems is widely distributed, and that, a German team, 
for example, can successfully implement systems in France and Italy. This will 
not always be the case.
622 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

A second tactic is to develop new transnational centers of excellence, or a single 
center of excellence. There may be several centers around the globe that focus on 
specific business processes. These centers draw heavily from local national units, 
are based on multinational teams, and must report to worldwide management. 
Centers of excellence perform the initial identification and specification of busi-
ness processes, define the information requirements, perform the business and 
systems analysis, and accomplish all design and testing. Implementation, how-
ever, and pilot testing are rolled out to other parts of the globe. Recruiting a wide 
range of local groups to transnational centers of excellence helps send the message 
that all significant groups are involved in the design and will have an influence. 
Even with the proper organizational structure and appropriate manage-
ment choices, it is still possible to stumble over technology issues. Choices of 
 technology platforms, networks, hardware, and software are the final element 
in building transnational information systems architectures.
15.4 WHAT ARE THE ISSUES AND TECHNICAL 
ALTERNATIVES TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN 
DEVELOPING INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS?
Once firms have defined a global business model and systems strategy, 
they must select hardware, software, and networking standards along with 
key system applications to support global business processes. Hardware, 
 software, and networking pose special technical challenges in an interna-
tional setting.
One major challenge is finding some way to standardize a global computing 
platform when there is so much variation from operating unit to  operating 
unit and from country to country. Another major challenge is finding 
 specific  software applications that are user friendly and that truly enhance 
the  productivity of international work teams. The universal acceptance of 
the Internet around the globe has greatly reduced networking problems. But 
the mere  presence of the Internet does not guarantee that information will 
flow  seamlessly throughout the global organization because not all business 
units use the same applications, and the quality of Internet service can be 
highly variable (just as with the telephone service). For instance, German 
business units may use an open source collaboration tool to share  documents 
and  communicate, which is incompatible with American headquarters teams, 
which use Microsoft solutions. Overcoming these challenges requires systems 
 integration and  connectivity on a global basis.
COMPUTING PLATFORMS AND SYSTEMS INTEGRATION
The development of a transnational information systems architecture based on 
the concept of core systems raises questions about how the new core systems 
will fit in with the existing suite of applications developed around the globe 
by different divisions, different people, and for different kinds of computing 
hardware. The goal is to develop global, distributed, and integrated systems 
to  support digital business processes spanning national boundaries. Briefly, 
these are the same problems faced by any large domestic systems develop-
ment effort. However, the problems are magnified in an international environ-
ment. Just imagine the challenge of integrating systems based on the Windows, 
 
Chapter 15 Managing Global Systems 
623

Linux, Unix, or proprietary operating systems running on IBM, Sun, HP, and 
other hardware in many different operating units in many different countries!
Moreover, having all sites use the same hardware and operating system does 
not guarantee integration. Some central authority in the firm must establish 
data standards, as well as other technical standards with which sites are to 
comply. For instance, technical accounting terms such as the beginning and 
end of the fiscal year must be standardized (review the earlier discussion of 
the cultural challenges to building global businesses), as well as the  acceptable 
interfaces between systems, communication speeds and architectures, and 
 network software.
CONNECTIVITY
Truly integrated global systems must have connectivity—the ability to link 
together the systems and people of a global firm into a single integrated  network 
just like the phone system but capable of voice, data, and image transmissions. 
The Internet has provided an enormously powerful foundation for providing 
connectivity among the dispersed units of global firms. However, many issues 
remain. The public Internet does not guarantee any level of  service (even in 
the United States). Few global corporations trust the security of the Internet 
and generally use private networks to communicate sensitive data, and Internet 
virtual private networks (VPNs) for communications that require less security. 
Not all countries support even basic Internet service that requires obtaining 
reliable circuits, coordinating among different carriers and the regional tele-
communications authority, and obtaining standard agreements for the level 
of telecommunications service provided. Table 15.5 lists the major challenges 
posed by international networks.
While private networks have guaranteed service levels and better security 
than the Internet, the Internet is the primary foundation for global corporate 
networks when lower security and service levels are acceptable. Companies 
can create global intranets for internal communication or extranets to exchange 
information more rapidly with business partners in their supply chains. They 
can use the public Internet to create global networks using VPNs from Internet 
service providers, which provide many features of a private network using the 
public Internet (see Chapter 7). However, VPNs may not provide the same level 
of quick and predictable response as private networks, especially during times

of the day when Internet traffic is very congested, and they may not be able to 
support large numbers of remote users.
The high cost of PCs, and low incomes, limit access to Internet service in 
many developing countries (see Figure 15.5). Where an Internet  infrastructure 
exists in less-developed countries, it often lacks bandwidth capacity, and is 
 unreliable in part due to power grid issues. The purchasing power of most 
people in developing countries makes access to Internet services very expen-
sive in local currencies. In the case of Russia, uneven Internet service and an 
undeveloped infrastructure for distributing and paying for goods has hampered 
the growth of e-commerce (see the Interactive Session on Organizations).
In addition, many countries monitor transmissions (see the Interactive 
Session on Management). Governments in China, Singapore, Iran, and Saudi 
Arabia monitor Internet traffic and block access to Web sites considered 
 morally or politically  offensive. On the other hand, the rate of growth in the 
Internet population is far faster in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East than in 
North America and Europe, where the Internet population is growing slowly 
if at all. Therefore, in the future, Internet  connectivity will be much more 
widely available and reliable in less- developed regions of the world, and it 
will play a significant role in integrating these economies with the world 
economy.
SOFTWARE LOCALIZATION
The development of core systems poses unique challenges for application 
 software: How will the old systems interface with the new? Entirely new 
 interfaces must be built and tested if old systems are kept in local areas 
(which is common). These interfaces can be costly and messy to build. If new 
software must be created, another challenge is to build software that can be 
realistically used by multiple business units from different countries given 
that  business units are accustomed to their unique business processes and 
definitions of data.
 FIGURE 15.5 INTERNET POPULATION IN SELECTED COUNTRIES
The percentage of the total population using the Internet in developing countries is much smaller than 
in the United States and Europe, but it is growing rapidly.

I N TER A C T IV E  S E S S IO N : O R G A N IZ AT IO N S 
E-COMMERCE RUSSIAN-STYLE
Nearly 63.6 million Russians have Internet access, 
making Russia the second-largest e-commerce market 
in all of Europe, behind only Germany. By the end of 
2014, Russia will surpass Germany with an estimated 
80 million users. Broadband reach is estimated at 40 
percent of all households—around 20 million house-
holds. Still, only a scant 24 to 26  million—about 38 
percent to 40 percent of Internet users—have made 
an online purchase through 2013 and e-commerce 
accounts for only 2  percent of Russian retail sales. 
Why? What’s holding  e-commerce back?
Russia has expanded its online consumer base 
faster than any other country, but there are serious 
barriers to further growth. Russia lacks both logis-
tics infrastructures and online payment systems for 
e-commerce to flourish. The postal system is both 
expensive and unreliable, with lost or stolen pack-
ages, excessive delivery time, and non-distributed 
parcel rates of up to 100 percent in remote areas. 
Cash is the predominant payment method due to an 
under-developed financial services sector, exorbitant 
bank charges, and lack of consumer trust in elec-
tronic  payments. Pre-authorization is often required 
for card use, merchants lack the infrastructure to 
store card data, and fraud poses a significant threat to 
merchants. Combined with the prohibitively expen-
sive investment required to deploy fiber connections 
across the vast expanses of Russian terrain, the imped-
iments to e-commerce expansion are substantial.
Russian online consumers by and large pay 
cash-on-delivery (COD) at “pick-up stores” where 
they collect their purchases. The collection centers 
accumulate large quantities of cash, which must be 
deposited every few hours to reduce the risk of theft. 
A system of payment kiosks has also sprung up on 
street corners, and in grocery stores, small shops, 
and convenience stores. These kiosks also serve 
as bill payment centers and often include multiple 
terminals from different companies, fashioning a 
comprehensive payment island. Several online pay-
ment systems have been developed including Yandex 
Money and WebMoney. These e-wallets, often sub-
ject to daily transaction limits, are linked to domestic 
bank accounts or debit cards or loaded with funds at 
the kiosks or offline stores. Though Yandex Money 
has signed up 20,000 merchants and 14 million 
consumers, and WebMoney 2,200 merchants and 6 
million users, 80 percent of all B2C e-commerce in 
Russia is still conducted in cash. 
Russian e-commerce is developing, but at a 
slower pace than Western markets. Half of habitual 
 e-commerce consumers only began shopping online 
in the last two years. Card and online payment 
systems are gaining acceptance for digital goods 
(software, e-books, and digital music) and travel 
 purchases such as airline tickets and hotel reserva-
tions. Shoppers have entered the online sphere for 
these products as well as for books, and are expand-
ing to electronics, computers, and home appliances, 
and then jewelry, cosmetics, clothing, and shoes. 
Online shopping mall Ozon began in 1998 as an 
online bookstore but now stocks well over 2 mil-
lion items. Ozon adopted a multi-pronged strategy 
to combat Russia’s market challenges. In the short-
term, it accepted customer preference for COD 
in order to build trust, expand its customer base, 
and establish market position. Its delivery service 
(O’Courier) and 2,100 pick-up centers serve 350 cities 
throughout Russia and Kazakhstan. This logistics net-
work dwarfs those of its competitors.
Another domestic leader, KupiVIP, has also 
 succeeded largely because it built its own logis-
tics network including multiple warehouses and 
a fleet of delivery trucks. Centered on its original 
 high-fashion flash sales site, KupiVIP (kupi means 
buy in Russian) now includes nine white-label sites 
and ShopTime, a full-priced fashion site. KupiVIP’s 
delivery drivers to double as customer service 
reps. In addition to collecting COD payments and 
 merchandise for return, they will even wait at the 
door while customers try on merchandise to decide 
if they want to keep it.
The unexpected leader of Russian e-commerce, 
however, is hybrid online-offline retailer Ulmart, 
which recently became the first Russian e-tailer 
to surpass $1 billion (USD) in sales. Founded in 
August 2008 to sell computers online, it quickly 
expanded into home electronics, household 
 appliances  children’s goods, auto parts, and tires. 
Ulmart  complements its online selling with 32 
Kibermarkets—electronics superstores open 24 
hours a day—as well as around 140 pick-up out-
posts in 150 cities across Russia. Five hubs supply 
the fulfillment  centers, and a fleet of nearly 200 
trucks transports merchandise from the warehouses 
to the outposts and makes home deliveries. Floor 
space that would traditionally be taken up with row 
after row of  product is instead used for computer

also at the forefront of Russian m-commerce, build-
ing a new Web site for  smartphones, even while

Ulmart’s conspicuous vulnerability is its neglect

and Amazon is in the process of building one, but 
their presence is overshadowed by Russian firms, 
which control 90 percent of the market.

Aside from integrating the new with the old systems, there are problems of 
human interface design and functionality of systems. For instance, to be truly 
useful for enhancing productivity of a global workforce, software interfaces 
must be easily understood and mastered quickly. Graphical user interfaces 
are ideal for this but presuppose a common language—often English. When 
 international systems involve knowledge workers only, English may be the 
assumed international standard. But as international systems penetrate deeper 
into management and clerical groups, a common language may not be assumed 
and human interfaces must be built to accommodate different languages and 
even conventions. The entire process of converting software to operate in a 
second language is called software localization.
What are the most important software applications? Many international  systems 
focus on basic transaction and management reporting systems. Increasingly, firms 
are turning to supply chain management and enterprise systems to  standardize 
their business processes on a global basis and to create coordinated global supply 
chains. However, these cross-functional systems are not always compatible with 
differences in languages, cultural heritages, and business processes in other 
 countries (Martinons, 2004; Liang et al., 2004; Accenture, 2014). Company units 
in countries that are not technically sophisticated may also encounter problems 
trying to manage the technical complexities of enterprise applications.

At an average speed of 17 MBPs, South Korea boasts 
the highest average Internet speed in the world 
and tops the world on speed for the price. All large 
office and apartment buildings are equipped with 
fiber-optic broadband and a $24 billion high-speed 
backbone links public institutions and government 
facilities. This country’s population also boasts a 
high level of Internet usage: 97 percent of South 
Koreans have high-speed Internet access at home 
and subway riders in Seoul enjoy free access on 
their smartphones. By the end of 2014, Koreans will 
have access to 1GB per second connections, 200 
times faster than the average household connection 
in the United States.
The paradox is that this flourishing tech-savvy 
democracy, which enjoys broad constitutional free-
doms, is also among the most Internet-regulated 
countries in the world. South Korea’s 1995 Electronic 
Communication Business Law granted wide latitude 
to the Information and Communications Ethics 
Office to block material deemed morally offensive or 
harmful to South Korean youth. Political speech, par-
ticularly relating to longtime foe North Korea, was, 
and still is, rigorously controlled. North Korean URLs 
have been off-limits and online support for North 
Korea could be grounds for investigation, detention, 
and revocation of Internet access.
The Internet Content Filtering Ordinance, enacted 
by the Ministry of Information and Communication 
(MIC) in 2001, required ISPs to block a specific list of 
Web sites. Schools and public libraries were required 
to provide access but had to install filtering software. 
Web sites are ostensibly self-monitoring based on a 
content ratings system administered today by the 
Korean Communications Standards Commission 
(KCSC). However, if MIC orders a site to classify 
itself as “indecent,” failure to block access to minors 
can result in fines or imprisonment.
The Internet Content Filtering Ordinance also 
recommended a verifiable real-name registration 
system that would require all users who posted com-
ments or uploaded content to have an account that 
included their Resident Registration Number (RRN). 
In 2003, MIC asked the four major Web portals to 
develop such a system. These actions were sold to 
the public as necessary to curb abusive behavior and 
cyber-bullying, particularly following a number of 
high-profile celebrity suicides.
One of the largest sites affected was Google-
owned YouTube, which chose to block South Korean 
users from uploading content rather than collect 
RRNs. The system was easily thwarted, however, by 
 simply changing the location setting for an account 
to Worldwide. Press reports even indicated that the 
YouTube channel for the presidential office used this 
simple ploy.
While pressure from citizens’ groups and court 
challenges have rolled back some restrictions, the 
threat of criminal liability has fostered a culture of 
fear and self-censorship. ISPs are ultimately held 
responsible if inappropriate—immoral,  violent, 
obscene, speculative, or antisocial—content is found 
on their networks. RRNs must still be  proffered 
for adults to access online games at night because 
 curfews bar minors. Mobile service providers do not 
yet know if the ruling exempts them from  collecting 
RRNs, and there have been several  high-profile 
 prosecutions involving online postings on Twitter 
and Facebook. Searching the Internet is often 
 unproductive because Web sites prohibit search 
engines from indexing their pages.
Google is also finding South Korea a challenging 
environment for Google Maps. The National Security 
Law (NSL), the basis for censoring Web sites with 
North Korean content, also prohibits the export of 
map data to safeguard infrastructure details. For 
travelers, and the companies that want to profit 
from helping them navigate, this has presented a 
 challenge. Directions from airports to area hotels can 
only be divined for mass transit, thanks to publically 
available routes and schedules.
President Park Geun-hye has expressed willing-
ness to ease regulations for foreign competition. A 
division of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and 
Transport will release an English-language digital 
map in 2014. However, points of interest, pedestrian 
overpasses, bicycle lanes, and details of intersec-
tions will still not be available. What’s more, without 
domestic servers, Google will not be able to provide 
the level of detail of local rivals such as Naver—
which only serves Korean-language users. Driving 
directions, traffic data, and building floor plans must 
be processed at Google’s servers outside of South 
Korea, subjecting them to export restrictions.

 celebrities netting six-figure contracts, game develop-
ers must contend not only with the nighttime  curfew 
for minors but also with the Game Rating Board 
(GRB). The GRB can ban any game, though its focus 
has been graphically violent games such as Grand 
Theft Auto III. The already lengthy approval process 
increases development costs for mobile games and 
discourages young entrepreneurs. Domestic compa-
nies such as Nexon Co. and NCSoft Corp. are compet-

such as Apple and Google have decided not to enter 
the Korean market. 
If President Park is serious about developing the 
high-tech software and services sector to match 
South Korea’s success in hardware—Samsung and 
LG, for example—she must perform a balancing 
act. Elimination of online restrictions must be bal-

can coexist with its economic development goals.

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems and supply chain management 
systems are widely used by manufacturing and distribution firms to connect to 
suppliers on a global basis. Collaboration systems, e-mail, and videoconferenc-

be increasingly employed for such purposes.
Review Summary
1. What major factors are driving the internationalization of business?
The growth of inexpensive international communication and transportation has created a world 
culture with stable expectations or norms. Political stability and a growing global knowledge base that 
is widely shared also contribute to the world culture. These general factors create the conditions for 
global markets, global production, coordination, distribution, and global economies of scale.

Review Questions
15-1  What major factors are driving the internation-
alization of business?
• List and describe the five major dimensions 
for developing an international information 
systems architecture.
•  Describe the five general cultural factors 
 leading toward growth in global business 
and the four specific business factors. 
Describe the interconnection among these 
factors.
2. What are the alternative strategies for developing global businesses?
There are four basic international strategies: domestic exporter, multinational, franchiser, and  transnational. 
In a transnational strategy, all factors of production are coordinated on a global scale. However, the choice of 
strategy is a function of the type of business and product.
There is a connection between firm strategy and information systems design. Transnational firms must 
develop networked system configurations and permit considerable decentralization of  development and 
operations. Franchisers almost always duplicate systems across many countries and use centralized financial 
controls. Multinationals typically rely on decentralized independence among foreign units with some 
 movement toward development of networks. Domestic exporters typically are centralized in domestic 
 headquarters with some decentralized operations permitted.
3. What are the challenges posed by global information systems and management solutions for these  challenges?
Global information systems pose challenges because cultural, political, and language diversity  magnifies 
differences in organizational culture and business processes and encourages proliferation of disparate local 
information systems that are difficult to integrate. Typically, international systems have evolved without a 
conscious plan. The remedy is to define a small subset of core business processes and focus on building 
 systems to support these processes. Tactically, managers will have to coopt widely  dispersed foreign units to 
participate in the development and operation of these systems, being careful to maintain overall control.
4. What are the issues and technical alternatives to be considered when developing international  information 
systems?
Implementing a global system requires an implementation strategy that considers both business design 
and technology platforms. The main hardware and telecommunications issues are systems integration and 
connectivity. The choices for integration are to go either with a proprietary  architecture or with open  systems 
technology. Global networks are extremely difficult to build and operate. Firms can build their own global 
networks or they can create global networks based on the Internet (intranets or virtual private networks). 
The main software issues concern building interfaces to existing systems and selecting applications that can 
work with multiple cultural, language, and organizational  frameworks.

 Companies with many overseas locations need a way to inform employees about available job openings 
in these locations. In this project you’ll use database software to design a database for posting internal job 
openings and a Web page for displaying this information.
KTP Consulting operates in various locations around the world. KTP specializes in designing, 
 developing, and implementing enterprise systems for medium- to large-size companies. KTP offers its employ-
ees  opportunities to travel, live, and work in various locations throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. 
The firm’s human resources department has a simple database that enables its staff to track job vacancies. 
When an employee is interested in relocating, she or he contacts the human resources department for a list of 
KTP job vacancies. KTP also posts its employment opportunities on the company Web site.
What type of data should be included in the KTP job vacancies database? What information should 
not be included in this database? Based on your answers to these questions, build a job vacancies  database 
for KTP. Populate the database with at least 20 records. You should also build a simple Web page that 
 incorporates job vacancy data from your newly created database. Submit a copy of the KTP database and

Unilever’s Push Toward Unified Global Systems
CASE STUDY
P
alm oil was the driving force behind the 
1929 merger that created what is today 
the third largest consumer goods company 
in the world behind Proctor Gamble and 
Nestlé. What may have seemed an odd marriage 
between British soap maker, Lever Brothers, and 
Dutch margarine producer, Margarine Unie, provided 
new company, Unilever, unprecedented purchasing 
power for the primary raw material of both products. 
Today Unilever focuses on 14 brands, each netting 
more than €1 billion annually including laundry soap 
Surf (Omo), soap, shower gel, shampoo and condi-
tioner brands Lux, Dove, and Sunsilk, and deodorant 
and personal care brands Axe (Lynx) and Rexona, 
also sold as Sure, Degree, Shield, and Rexena. On 
the edible side, top sellers include ice cream brands 
Magnum and Heartbrand, margarine brands Becel 
(Flora/Promise/Fruit d’Or) and Rama, mayonnaise 
brands Hellmann’s and Best Foods, and soup, season-
ings, and tea brands Lipton and Knorr. All told, the 
Anglo-Dutch multinational boasts over 400 brands, 
sells its products in over 190 countries, and employs 
more than 175, 000 people worldwide.
Unilever is organized as two separate holding 
companies: Unilever PLC (public limited com-
pany), headquartered in London, United Kingdom, 
and Unilever N.V., headquartered in Rotterdam, 
The Netherlands. The two legal divisions operate 
as nearly as possible to a single economic entity—
The Unilever Group—with unity of management, 
 operations, purpose, and mission.
Since 2009, when Dutchman Paul Polman took 
the reins as CEO, The Unilever Group has made 
 sustainable living the core goal of its business model. 
Using the inputs common to all major packaged 
goods manufacturers—brands, people, and opera-
tions—Unilever’s Compass strategy focuses on using 
cost leveraging and cost efficiencies, innovation in 
marketing and marketing investment, and profitable 
volume growth to yield sustained growth, lowered 
environmental impact, and positive social impact.
By 2010, a 10 year plan quantified the goals: to 
double sales from €40 billion to €80 billion, halve 
its environmental footprint, reach 4 billion of the 
world’s estimated 9 billion 2020 citizens, bring safe 
drinking water to 500 million people, source 100 
 percent of its raw materials sustainably, and improve 
the lives of 500,000 small farmers and distributors by 
bringing them into its supply chain. Given the reality 
of climate change and the growing scarcity of water 
and other natural resources, Polman believes viable 
business models for the 21st century must include 
strategies for maximizing social and environmental 
returns along with profits and investor returns.
In order to grow its business in developing and 
emerging markets, Unilever needed to unify its 
core business processes, including supply chain 
management. Standardized processes were essential 
to effectively manage volatile prices and changing 
commodity supplies. However, ambitious company-
wide goal setting such as this was not feasible prior 
to 2007. At that point, almost every business in each 
of the more than 190 countries in which Unilever 
operated functioned as an independent division. 
Approximately 30,000 transactions per minute, 
including every order received, invoice issued, 
material produced, and product shipped were 
 processed through 250 different enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) systems. 
Unilever’s Global ERP Vice President Marc Bechet 
has pointed out that the company’s worldwide 
 business runs on ERP systems. Every transaction for 
each order it receives, material it produces, item it 
ships, and invoice it issues runs through Unilever’s 
backbone ERP systems. Trying to run a global 
 business that was doubling its transaction volume 
with 250 systems proved too challenging.
Instead of adding layers of IT infrastructure 
to prepare for rapid business growth, Unilever’s 
 globalization strategy involved the exact opposite 
action. For the past two decades, Unilever has been 
consolidating and simplifying its technology  platform 
so that it would support the company operating as a 
single global entity. Unilever transitioned to  running 
its worldwide business on only four instances of 
SAP ERP, with the ultimate goal of managing these 
 landscapes as one global platform by 2015.
By 2008, the rollout of the Western European 
regional SAP ERP system was complete with three 
more regional centers to come. North America was 
online by the beginning of 2012. Return on this 
investment was already notable by 2013. IT research 
and advisory firm, Gartner ranked Unilever fourth 
on its Supply Chain Top 25 list, and revenue had 
increased €10 billion, already one quarter of the way 
towards its 2020 goal.
 
Chapter 15 Managing Global Systems 
633

With transactions slated to reach the 60,000 
per minute range, Unilever was still investigating 
 additional tools to increase transaction processing 
speed. To remain a leader in modern demand-driven 
supply chain management, Unilever began adding 
SAP HANA (High-Performance Analytic Appliance) 
software to some of its key SAP ERP applications 
at the end of 2012. HANA is an in-memory data 
platform (see Chapter 6) that is deployable as an 
on-premise appliance, or in the cloud. It is very 
well suited for performing real-time analytics and 
 processing extremely large numbers of transactions 
very rapidly. 
One of Unilever’s first projects was implement-
ing SAP CO-PA (Controlling-Profitability Analysis) 
Accelerator powered by SAP HANA. The enhanced 
financial analysis software reduced the number of 
days to produce the month-end close from three to 
just one. This experience was valuable for Unilever 
on several levels. It allowed the company to start 
with a single critical business process that could 
 easily be rolled back into a traditional database if 
necessary, gain experience, and lay the ground-
work for future HANA implementations. The suc-
cess of this project and its enthusiastic embrace by 
end users convinced Unilever that other business 
 processes could indeed benefit from the addition of 
the SAP HANA in-memory computing platform.
The second tangible benefit was the ability to 
input raw material costs and quickly calculate 
product price. Understanding its margins—the 
percent profit after all costs have been deducted—
enabled Unilever to analyze ways to improve them. 
Production cost analysis confirmed for Unilever that 
HANA’s ability to accelerate business processes was 
well worth the investment, substantially improving 
real-time decision making.
Unilever’s Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) 
 system extracts, transforms, and integrates ERP trans-
action data with external data for use in  reporting 
and data analysis. The next target of the SAP HANA 
initiative was to accelerate, simplify, and harmonize 
all ERP transaction systems so that the data being 
fed into its global EDW was of the highest qual-
ity possible. Valuable business insights depend on 
real-time analysis of accurate data. The profitability 
analysis accelerator analyzes reams of financial data 
and outputs valuable statistics about cost and profit 
 drivers. By mid-2013, the SAP CO-PA Accelerator had 
been added to all four regional ERP centers over a 16 
week timeframe and was being managed as a single 
global platform. Each region now runs a 27 tera-
byte relational database using 30 gigabytes of HANA 
in-memory system.  Two hundre million records are 
now  processed in 30 seconds, down from 440. 
Cost Center assessment time was reduced 39 
percent, pushing this data into CO-PA in 6.7 hours 
rather than 11 hours and speeding profitability 
reporting. Overall, controlling and profitability 
reports were produced ten times more quickly. 
The Material Ledger Accelerator reduced runtime 
for period-end closing reports by 66 percent, and 
cost reduction opportunities were identified by the 
Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) Management 
platform. Four and a half billion records for General 
Ledger line items and over 400 million control-
ling and profitability analysis records are now run 
through the CO-PA Accelerator. 
Next, SAP Cash Forecasting was added to SAP 
ERP Financials to minimize liquidity risk and maxi-
mize the use of working capital and cash. Product 
Cost Planning (CO-PC-PCP) was incorporated to 
help Unilever plan the costs for materials indepen-
dently from orders; set prices for materials, opera-
tions, production lines, and processes; analyze the 
costs of manufactured materials; and assess product 
 profitability. The time to analyze the approximately 
150 million records produced each month was 
halved, and product cost forecasts could be generated 
in 30 seconds, down from seven minutes.
On the macro level, the SAP HANA initia-
tive transformed Unilever’s attitude towards IT. 
Until HANA, IT pushed solutions to functions in 
need of modernization. Now, optimized functions 
 pinpoint business opportunities and stakeholders 
ripe for HANA solutions. Unilever’s Global Director 
of Finance Thomas Benthien believes this swing 
from push to pull is a driver for innovation and a 
growth agenda. Proofs of concept (prototypes used 
for feasibility testing) were conducted to add the 
HANA in-memory platform to many components 
of Unilever’s SAP Business Suite, including the SCM 
(Supply Chain Management) application. Other tests 
involved components of the Enterprise Performance 
Management (EPM) system, SAP Advanced Planning 
& Optimization (APO), SAP Business Planning 
and Consolidation, and SAP Trade Promotion 
Management.
Unilever wanted to maximize product availabil-
ity on store shelves during new product launches 
and promotional campaigns. Since trade promo-
tion  processes drive a significant portion of its 
sales, Marc Béchet wanted to enhance the speed 
and  efficiency with which they could be planned, 
 budgeted, and executed and in how stock was 
 allocated. Previously, Unilever used a process in 
634 Part Four Building and Managing Systems

which stock was sequentially assigned to orders as 
they were received. There was no mechanism for 
assigning limited stock between customers running 
a promotion and those who were not. Using HANA-
accelerated trade promotion management tools, 
 different inventory matching scenarios are instantly 
available. Allocation options can be compared and 
the most profitable chosen. Inventory shortfalls can 
be handled while safeguarding current promotions to 
the maximum extent possible.
Plans are now underway to add in-memory 
 technology to the rest of the SAP Business Suite. 
SAP released the first version of SAP Business Suite 
 powered by HANA in January 2013. Unilever is 
weighing its options so that the risk of adoption to 
one of the largest SAP ERP systems in the industry 
is minimized, but it is likely to switch to the newest 
product before 2015. 
By significantly cutting the time it takes to 
 calculate product costs, the HANA in-memory 
da tabase accelerators fast-track raw material sourcing 
decisions and pricing analysis. Unilever estimates 
that time spent tracking raw materials has declined 
by 80 percent. Improved understanding of the supply 
chain, in turn, supports managerial decision-making 
to both improve efficiency and reduce environmen-
tal impact. Without the analytics solution it devised 
and implemented, Unilever would have had a dif-
ficult time tracking the 10,000 home and personal 
care products that use the 2,000 different chemicals 
that must be reduced to meet the European Union’s 
REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and 
Restriction of Chemicals) regulations and its own 
more stringent sustainability goals. Consolidation 
of its ERP platforms and the transaction and 
 processing speed of the HANA platform are the keys 
to improved performance, reporting, and scalabil-
ity that will enable Unilever to fulfill its ambitious 
growth, social impact, and environmental goals.
