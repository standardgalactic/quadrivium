HOSTESS WITH
THE MOSTESS
Elvira (upfront gothic
temptress, not the Spanish
version of Vera Duckworth)
is to star in Mistress of the
Dark on C64 after all. The
American horror hostess,
who is big in more ways
than one, was signed up by
Tynesoft over a year ago,
then, after their downfall,
Dornark, the rather spunky
Tengen licensee, has
released another
completely brilliant
compilation from its Putney
empire. Now, what's so
stonky is that the mix-em-
up includes Cyberball and
Vindicators which have
never made it onto the C64
on tape or disk before. If
you're a loyal YC follower of
fashion you'll remember
that Cyberball was a YC
Fun One and a front cover
game back in May last year,
if you don't remember, not
taken over by Accolade who
published the 16-bit
versions of her lusty
adventure game. Now, C64
owners can oodle over her,
care of Micro Value who will
be releasing her 8 bits (Huh
Hmm). You can be sure that
YC will keep abreast of the
situation!
BOB'S YOUR UNCLE?
CLICK"Diane... I have here
in my hand a folder
containing a proposal for a
computer game based
around my investigations in
Twin Peaks. A game would
only have you missed out
on a year's supply of VC,
but the fact that Cyberball
is futuristic American
football mayhem at it's
best. Vindicators is a fast
and furious tank blast-em-
up where you travel 'round
blasting enemy tanks in
your aim to take over a
space station. The puzzle

U P P E R S  A N D  D O W N E R S
This month's industry news is a bit like the
poll tax, with companies going down one
minute and then announcing new deals the
next and it all gets a bit complicated - let
me explain. Grandslam was once dead,
now it's back with Hunt for Red October
and England FC. Since then CRL, maker of
such classics as Rocky Horror Show (and
embarrassments such as Kel logs Cycling
Challenge), died a slow and painful death,
but then a rather suspicious CAL package
arrived at YC headquarters under the
STOP THIEF
When a little bird saw
Ocean's development guy
Gary Bracey creeping out of
Pinewood recently, it wasn't
because he'd stolen part of
the Batman set. Methinks it
had something to do with the
ﬁlming Of the new Robin
Hood ﬁlm, "Prince of
Thieves", starring Kevin
Costner as goodie-two-shoes
Robin, Brain Blessed, and
Mike McShane (the big man
of Who's Line is it Anyway). Is
YC an incy bit previous or
have we sussed out the No 1
Christmas license already.
Keep a close watch on this
spot (in case it explodes!)
pseudonym "On-Line", and
announcements were made linking the
company to c u rv .
From Rampage to Robo Kids, Activision
and parent company Mediagenic had
probs but now their fairy godmother, The
Disc Company, is handling their European
affairs. Finally, Hewson o f  Uridium fame -
was infested with receivers when we
called, obviously taking a blow from the
Activision downfall. Confused? Tune in
next month for another exciting episode...
IH
GOODBYEEE!!!
So this is it chums (cue sad
muzak, and melodramatic
black and white tint), there
comes a time in every Ed's
life when the hot seat
becomes a little too
comfortable, and a decision
must be made to either
spend the rest of your life
sitting down, or move on to
further challenges.
This time has come for
me, my readers, to pack my
spam sandwiches, head off
into the pale pink sunset,
and leave YC behind. I hope
that the last year and a half
have been as good for you
as it has me. We've had
some good times (and some
incredibly dodgy ones) and
I'll certainly remember the
footy photo story, the ENIF
interview, and the kerazy
Murder weekend - I hope
you do too.
Things are not all snotty
and wet though, I'm not
disappearing off the face of
YC's earth. I'm actually off
to edit sister mag Your
Amiga, and put my own
stamp on it! So, if you ever
manage to get yourself one
of the 64's big brothers (the
Amiga, of course), come and
join me - the party's not
over, it's just moving
locations. And you're not to
worry about VC either,
'cause I'm leaving it in the
more than capable hands of
Jeff Davy (that well known
VC contributor), and I'm sure
he'll be offering you much of
the same, and tonnes more,
of what you're used to.
You'll also be able to sample
my lunacy every issue in the
form of Cosmic Comic (I'll
still be editing that for the
foreseeable future).
That's about it. You've
made my life here very easy,
and let's hope I'll see most
of you over on VA shortly.
Cheers!!!

I
fellows sitting around a
big debating table with
piles of papers and cups of
decafﬁnated coffee placed
precariously to their side.
One of them has his hand on
his chin and is in serious
ponder mode, the other has
just had an incredibly good
idea and is leaning forward in
his chair ready to reveal all.
"I've just had a
completely splendid idea!',
says man in suit 1.
"Oh yehr, grumbles man
in suit 2, "Pray tell."
"Why don't we release a
footy game, you know,
'cause they're quite popular
at the moment?"
"And what do we call this
excellent throbber of an
idea?"
"Why not name it after the
incredibly superb England
footy team that did so
wonderfully in the recent
World Cup?"
"England?"
"Yes! Think of the
marketing potential!"
"No, I don't think so. I've
got a better idea anyway,
let's release a puzzle game
instead!"
And that, dear readers, is
how Big Ron's Software
Limited let the England game
slip through their ﬁngers, but
lucky for us Grandslam has it
anyway and we ﬁnally get to
see a copy.
So what's different about
this footy game then? What
makes it so special? Not a lot
to be honest, but what more
can be done nowadays. All
we can hope for is an
improvement on what has
been done before, and
England is certainly an
improvement.
The concept is a well tried
and tested one; top-down
game-play with loads of
action, and a team selection
half with great presentation,
but it's the way that these are
implemented that makes
England so fruity (so fruity, in
fact, that the man from Del
Monte he say ''Stick in a
good one, Bully boy!").
Before the game itself is
the team selection thingmy,
where you get to choose what
team to play from a selection
of England, England, and
erm... England (a second
player can be any one of the
remaining teams), and you'll
then be confronted with an
option screen allowing you to
choose the players for the
team from your huge squad
(all up-to-date, of course), with
each player having individual
ratings out of 5 for Skill,
Strength, Speed (Maradona's
fave, geddit?), and Energy
(which goes down during the
game). After a couple of
games you'll ﬁnd that some
players are not available due
to several reasons, the main
one being that they forgot to
hold back and gave the ref a
good kicking before being
dragged off the pitch by the
Belgian Police force.
Now you get on the pitch
and you realise that everything
is similar, and it doesn't take a
bofﬁn with an IQ of three
trillion to realise what was the
main inspiration for
this section.
Fortunately,
though, is
that
everything
compares
far more
favourably
to Kick Off
on the 16-
bits than
even Kick
Off on the
commie itself.
The action is very
smooth, the
graphics are tonnes better,
there are more options
(pictures of the ref and
linesmen coming up when an
offence has been commited).
no horrible buggy things, full
action replays, weather
conditions that affect the way
the ball moves, better sound
effects, need 1 go on?
The whole of the
European Championships are
in there for you to try to win,
and it's a while since we've
said this but I think we've
ﬁnally come across a worthy
successor to Emlyn Hughes'
International Soccer (that old
chestnut). Now, aren't I
meant to make some
incredibly poor joke about
Grandslam scoring
with this one? No, I
don't think I shall!
A very slick and polish
more than capable of
park as Kick Off, or its
will be waving their
ed footy game that is
playing on the same
sequel. England fans
scarves as I write.

And they took it out to the corner ﬂag where there was
much mud and extreme amounts of violence! The ref came
ﬂying in with his red card and metal studs - it took two
weeks to remove him from the Italian's leg!!!

We're all going off to Wembley,
we're all gonna meet the team.
YC and Grandslam have joined
forces to offer one incredibly
lucky individual the chance to
see England vs. Germany (the
ﬁrst time that a united Germany
has played at Wembley since
the war) whilst sitting in a rather
spiffy VIP seat, and after the
game the winner'll meet some
of today's stars that make the
England footy team so great,
plus a copy of the England
game that could be signed on
the day. And 12 runners-up get
a copy of the stonky England
game too (talk about being
generous, eh?).

All you have to do to be in
with a chance of winning this
absolutely stunning prize is
answer the six easy-peasy
questions below and then, as a
tie-break, choose your top team
made up of England players
from the last 30-years. Once
you've come to some sort of
judgement, write down their
names in the spaces provided
(you must stick to the 4-3-3
formation that we offer [le. 1
Goalkeeper, 4 Defenders, 3
Midﬁelders, 3 Forwards). For
example, if you wished to put
Chris Woods as your top
England goalie of all time, you'd
put him next to where it says

1 catalogue ﬂying around
1 t h e  industry at the
moment, you're bound to ﬁnd
some of it in any one of three
places. A) it could be on a
budget label. B) some of the
games end up on our front
cover tape. And C) (the most
likely) it could end up in a
compilation with games
tenuously linked in some way
or another.
System 3's now managed
to ﬁnd enough of its back
catalogue to lump it all in the
same box, and offer it at a
mega cheap° price to those
who have missed the
previous carnival. And the
line-up is most
impressive!
LAST NINA
This is the game that really
made the software world
gasp and go "oh my word,
what an absolutely spiffy
game indeed!" It's brilliant
mix of arcade adventure and
beat-em-up action was so
original that it provoked more
than one magazine to call it
the best thing since sliced
bread. It didn't take too long,
though, for sliced bread to
become something that was
taken for granted, and now
Last Ninja also looks very
dated.
That said, it's only pale in
comparison to it's older
brothers (Last Ninja 2, Ninja
Remix, and Last Ninja 3), and
against most other arcade
adventures it wipes the ﬂoor
with them (after delivering a
rather mean roundhouse kick
to the knackers). The 3D
viewpoint was (and still is)
inspirational, and the game is
so polished that if released
on its own today, it would still
sell in bucketioads.
DOMINATOR
Not a typical System 3 game,
and the story goes that the
Cale brothers (by the time it
was ﬁnished) didn't want
anything to do with it. That
said it's not a bad little shoot-
em-up. Admittedly, in
comparison to the blasters
released at the moment (St
Dragon and Swiv, to name
two of the best) it lacks that
certain something, but you'll
certainly play it a few times
and if that's the case it can't
be all bad.
The graphics are very
slick and the speed is of a
jolly rate, so your trigger
ﬁnger will certainly regret it if
you don't at least try
Dominator.
FLIMBO'S
QUEST
This is a very, very good
cute-em-up and platform
game, and I enthused about it
back in our June issue. It was
an excellent game
then, and it's not
changed its appeal
to me now.
Being very
Japanese in style,
you must guide our
Flimbo around a
horizontally scrolling
landscape and shoot
all the inhabitants
into extinction. When
you shoot the
ﬂashing sprite (just before it's
•arrested for indecency) a
scroll will appear which, once
collected, you take to a shop
and eventually make up a
word. Once you've ﬁnished
collecting you'll be

transported to the next level,
and so on. Eventually you'll
get to the ﬁnal level and be
able to rescue Flimbette (your
beloved girlie).
Great graphics and a
superb variety in gameplay
made this into a classic, and
keeps it as such.
LAST NINJA 2
Another slice of Ninja action
that deals even more options
and adventuring than it's
prequel. There's not much
more to say about it, apart
from the fact that its
playability is legendary.
MYTH
Another of the System 3
success stories. Myth was
slammed by Ashley yonks ago,
and heralded by myself only a
couple of issues back, it really
depends if you want a game to
last a brief few seconds, or
several months.
It's another arcade
adventure (something that
System 3 seems very good at),
but this time very much in the
standard platform game
mould. The graphics and
puzzle elements are anything
but standard though, in fact
they're incredible, and are
0  The Last Ninja — a legend in its own lunchtime! As you can
see, there's a few graphical changes between the original
and its sequel!
exactly what you'd want to
leave running on your commie
to show off to any of those
Speccy owning friends.
You have to travel
through several
mythological timescapes,
ﬁnally confronting a big,
mean demon and giving him
a right good twatting.
Although it's not too easy, the
ﬁendish puzzles and the
gameplay will keep you
transﬁxed for several decades.
IVIERNATIONA
KARATE
Atypical beat-em-up that
wowed 'em in its day, even if it
is a little past it now. It follows
the since well-trodden path of
joystick direction good, hard
punch to the particulars, and
that's about it
The graphics are a tad
legoesque (ie. blocky) and the
sonics are a tad on the crap
side, but in gameplay you can't
beat it for sheer Sunday
afternoon fun.

June 1944, somewhere in
Bavaria. The mid su mme r
heat blazes down on the air
force ofﬁcers assembled in
the courtyard in LuftStalag
13.
In more peaceful times,
the feudal castle you
inhabit might have been
picturesque, but for you it's
a prison. Ever since that
night over Dusseldorf when
Tail-end Charlie bought it in
the ﬂak, and there was no-
one to spot that Junkers 88
that crept up on your Lanc,
you've been incarcerated in
I
Now, after three failed
escape attempts, you are
banged up in the
supposedly inescapable
chateau of lbzwitz.
Inescapable? No such
thing! It's up to you to
prove to Jerry that he's
taken on more than he can
handle.
HOW TO PLAY
Escape is an adventure
produced using the Quill,
and contains over eighty
locations. As you may have
guessed, your job is to
escape from a German
prisoner-of-war camp,
using the materials to hand.
As in all Quill
adventures, the input
required is verb followed by
noun. Entering V, for Vocab
will give you a list of all
verbs used in the game,
and HELP may even offer
you some help.
Text can be abbreviated
to four letters per word.

ZAKRON
Programmers: A. Docherty
and P. Atkin
Type: Complete game -
Arcade Action
Controls: Joystick in port 2
Back in those dark days of
the A..I games console,
one of the more popular
games had you knocking
bricks out of walls with a
continuously moving ball.
Since then, hundreds of
variations have appeared
on the scene. Basically
they are the same, the
main difference being the
number of levels and the
type of extra weapons that
you can release.
A VIEW FROM
ABOVE
ZAKRON takes the
'BREAKOUT' theme a little
step further. Instead of the
normal two  dimensional
playing area, you play on a
three dimensional plane.
The idea of the game is to
accumulate points by
knocking b ricks out with
the continually bouncing
ball. The ball is controlled
by the player using a bat,
as with all 'BREAKOUT'
variations. The difference
being that you are ABOVE
the playing area.
TIMING IS VITAL
When the ball reaches the
bottom of its bounce, and is
at its smallest, the player has
to deﬂect it by positioning the
bat appropriately. The angle
of deﬂection of the ball
depends on its point of
impact on the bat. When you
ﬁrst see the game you will
think that there is nothing to
it! I warn you now, it's not as
easy as it looks.
Enjoy!!

RESCUE
P ro g ra mme r: David Bryson
Type: Complete game -
Arcade Action
Co n tro ls: Joystick in port 2
Far into the future, the
Homosapien race has
innovated and expanded in
technology and occupation
so much that they now are
inhabiting and controlling
several planets and moons
with the aid of an immense
communications network
based on the planet Earth,
(which has gained acclaim
for it's reliability, but
certainly not it's cost).
MEANWHILE
Meanwhile humanoids have
stolen the jobs of many
people because of the
arrival of this extravagant
technology that is cheaper,
more efﬁcient and more
adaptable to harsh
environments. The capitalist
government's trust of the
security of the network
soon diminishes when
computer thugs, in league
with the examiners, manage
to crack the security system
and uphold all mining
activity on the eight planets
and moons. The
government is not prepared
to turn this into a scandal
as it has put so much
money and effort into the
network. So they ask you,
one of the top ranking
space pilots of the age, to
travel around the moons
and planets and rescue the
malfunctioned humanoids
to be awarded a substantial
sum of money and pay no
taxes for life. You can't
resist the opportunity , and
head off in the direction of
the colonies.
PLAYING RESCUE
Plug your joystick into
PORT 2 and control the ship
by pushing it left to thrust
left and right to thrust right.
Up controls the upwards
thrust and down controls
the downwards thrust. (Isn't
life simple?). Pressing FIRE
does not do anything at all.

ordinated control of the

joystick is required if you
want to complete all 8
levels, but I must say they
do not progress in difﬁculty
therefore keep trying in the
early stages. When you go
near a humanoid, it jumps
up and down ready for
rescuing, which you do
simply by running past it. If
you want to go and
meditate, press "P" to
pause the game. If the
mission gets too stressful,
press " 0 "  to quit and go
and have a lie down for a
few hours.
TECHNICAL
DETAILS
The game is protected
against SPRITE-
BACKGROUND disabling and
inﬁnite lives functions on
cartridges, so just pull that
nasty protrusion out of the
back and chuck it away. The
game code is over 3K long
and the graphics takes up
over 4K. The screens take up
to 8K (and no, they are not
compressed, who needs to
when the program gets
compressed anyway). I hope
you enjoy the game.

HOW TO ENTER
A MOVE
You will be asked the
question 'Which piece
to move?'. You should
type in the number
corresponding to the
piece you want to
move (the numbers are
displayed around the
board).
If one of your
counters has been
knocked off the board
S
by your opponent then you
should type 0  to the above
question to get your counter
back on the board. You must
re-enter this counter before
you can move any other.
If you cannot move then
type N to the above
question.
Once you have typed in
the piece to move you will
be asked 'Which dice to
use?'. You should type in the
value of one of the dice
displayed in the top right
corner and press return.
If you have typed in the
wrong counter to move and
only notice the mistake when
you have to input a dice
value then type 0  and return.
PLAYING THE
COMPUTER
The computer is always
White. It will display its
moves in a column on the
right. After it has ﬁnished
moving its pieces then you
should press any key to
continue. You should then
input your moves.
AT THE END OF THE
GAME
The game ﬁnishes when one
player has taken all ﬁfteen of
his counters off the board.
The points won will then be
displayed and added to the
totals for all games played.
HOW POINTS ARE
SCORED
The player who wins the
game receives one point for
each opponents counter left
on the board.
The player will receive
triple points if the opponent
also has one or more of his
counters in the winning
players home table.
TAPE PROBST
Oh dear! You've
plopped your funky YC
cassette into your
datacorder and all that
comes out is a rasping
sound as if it's layed a
huge trouser rumbler.
There could be a few
things that are wrong:
A) Your datasette is
completely up that
particular creek
without a spoon. (Take
it back to the place of
purchase).
B) The heads are
aligned wrongly on
your datasette. (Take it
to a computer shop to
be checked).
C) The tape is a
duffer! (Send it back to
the address below
with a self-addressed
envelope, and you'll
receive a new tape
within 28 days).
If you send the tape
back and we ﬁnd out
that the problem was A
or B, Post Apocalypse
will personally come
round to your house
with his baseball bat
and knock your
cranium for a home
run, get our drift.

Och the noo,
I'm back from
my little trip to
the rainy hills
of the Outer
Hebrides and I
can honestly
say that I'm
glad to be
back (for a
start me cap
was starting to
droop). Ho
well, on with
your pathetic
questions...
I think your mag is
ace and great value for
E1.95.
Could you please put
a list of all the
adventure games,
like the Cranmore
Diamond Affair on
the March tape,
available for the 64
in your mag? I would
be very grateful.
One more thing, what
game is better, Swiv or
Silkworm?
Allan Duffy, Glasgow
PA: Of course its good value,
and now that certain other
scabby rags have put their
prices
up by loads of
dosh, we're the only
sensible choice that's
available at a pocket money
price.
The adventure list is
deﬁnitely something that we'll
consider, like any reasonable
ideas (people writing in asking
for Rik's head to be ﬂushed
down the loo will be set about
with a
large
baseball bat)
that anybody has.
And as for Swiv vs.
Silkworm, they're both
completely stonky and if you
have a night of playing them
you'd probably need serious
psychiatric help, and at least
two years in a rehabilitation
centre for tired gamesplayers.

My birthday is April the 21st.
Would you be able to put Robocop or Total Recall on
your next tape please?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU...
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU...
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR MAR-ARK...
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!
Have a good one!!!
Mark Wagg, Address not given
PA: I'm afraid that we can't possibly put those particular
stonkers on our tape for quite some time, because they're still
selling like hot cakes. Stick with us for a year or two.
By the way, happy birthday! In fact, I'd like everybody to sing
the following words with the rest of the YC staff in order to
celebrate Mark's birthday (although he doesn't say how old he is)...
CHESTY
COUGH
I think your mag is utterly
brilliant (things seem to be
following a pattern here, I
think this'uns gonna ask
for something - PA).
I would like to get a few
things off my chest, so
could you answer these
questions for me?
1) On the November
1990 mag, the readers
could send off for a free
tape. I sent off for it and it
never came. Wha t
happened to it?
2) Will you please,
please put a playable demo
of Super Monaco GP on
the cover tape?
3) Is it possible to get
Fire and Forget for the
C64? How much would it
be? And where could I get
it from?
4) How do you get into
the secret room in
Rainbow Islands?
Adrian Shingler, Glossop,
Derbyshire
PA: Could I answer your
questions? Erm... (thinks long
and hard)... Nope!.. Oh, all
right then, maybe I should...
1) To cut a long story
short - the end! Let's just say
that everybody's got their
tapes by now and will be
currently hooked on Wabbit
as I speak.
2) If you remember, we
tried to do this a couple of
issues ago but somebody at
US Gold didn't think that the
game was the sort of thing
that you'd be able to put on
the tape due to it's gamep lay
(no immediate indication of
various short levels, etc.)
3) Hang on a sec, I'll ring
up Titus, the company behind
the ancient game... Brrrrrrr...
Click... Oh bugger, the money
won't go in the slot... What
am I gonna do?.. Click... Oh
sod - I'm off to play Road
Blasters instead.
4) I think you'd better ask
that foul pustule Oozin'
Eugene, he's the so called
expert on these things.
POSTER
APOCALYPSE
YC is a cool may (here we
go again, you lot are
deﬁnitely up to something -
PA). So what's Paul Rigby
doing in it? While we're on
the subject of disgusting
things, when was the last
time Oozin' Eugene had a
wash? Okay, onto less
personal things.
Next time you publish a
poster, please make sure
that there's no useful stuff,
like a review, on the other
side of it! Ah! Me playable
demo of Swiv just loaded!
I've gotta have a crack at It.
Keep on zapping other
commie mags (er... well... at
least something that looks
like a 100u/0 commie may),
see yal
R. Pillai, No address given
PS. (5 min later) Swiv is well
worth 95%, it's unreal!
Keep 'em demos coming!
PA: How rude can you get?
Paul's now locked himself in
his cave (with the big stone
key) and refuses to come out.
We're gonna have'ta offer him
the sacriﬁce of a whole tin of
luncheon meat
just to get him to
exit his domain.
And if we ever
want him to write
another
Misadventures for
us, we've gotta
give him a years
supply of Bird's
Eye Jumbo
Cod Fish
Fingers (in the
shapes of ﬁsh),
so he can use
them as fuel
(they bum quite a
while, I've heard).
As for Oozin'
Eugene, let's just say that men
still sat in trees the last time he
ventured into a bathroom. It's
rumoured that water could kill
him.
And posters, we're very
likely to give you something
even more stonky on that front
in the very near future.
ANOTHER
PLEB
In March's issue, when I
bought VC, I looked at the
contents to see what
reviews were in. I thought
they were pretty cool, then
I had a look at the regulars
and what did I see? (Please
tell us! - PA) I saw that
beside Scum of the Earth,
in small writing, you said
you were thinking of
changing Scum of the
Earth to Pleb of the Earth. I
think Scum of the Earth is
better.
Richard O'Brien, Dublin
PA: Erm... I actually think that
Rik was joking when he
added that to the contents
page. If he wasn't I'm sure
he's changed his mind by
now.
By the way, aren't you the
Richard O'Brien that wrote
The Rocky Horror Picture
Show, and hosts and
designed The Crystal Maze?
If so. how do you get your
dome so shiny, I've even
used Mr. Sheen on mine but
it always looks like a goat
skin rug.

"Ooze? Why

TIPS
Always top up on engine.

If you have enough cash,
try to buy side armour. This
will prevent your car's body
from being smashed in for a
couple of races.
Also, try to buy
front and rear
missiles. 'cause
if you hit 2 cars
with them you
don't have to
CREATURES
Another cheat for a Thalamus game, this time thanks to
Keith Wakley, a ﬁver winner.
Plug a joystick in port one. Wait until the music at the
beginning fades away, then when the fuzzie wuzzies on
the highscore table stop dancing, wiggle the joystick from
side to side. They will start to jump up and down, and
after what seems like ages they'll stop jumping, turn grey,
and you'll be able to start the game with inﬁnite lives.

you're in ﬁrst position.
Always buy power

powerful car, if you don't it's
like driving a car in ice or
snow.
Never buy spin resist, it's

levels one and two of this
excellent Codies budgie game. A

very nice.
Poodles: Snobby, curty things.

French policemen: Do sod all
Three shots to kill.
Clouds: Warning! Dangerl

over them, drop a bomb.
Level Two - Switzerland
Penguins: Waddle, waddle. Two
shots to kill. Can't be killed by

Little Girls: Skip, skip. Fax

Paul Milburn also hands this
previous YC Cove( game on a
plate, and gets an extra ﬁver for
doing so.
This is what you do to ﬁnish
the game: You have to get into
debt as much as you can, after
you've done everything else in
order to release a game, but
before you exit to the magazine
(eg. employ 100 members of
staff). Now exit to the mag, after
which you'll ﬁnd that you've lost.
Now play the game again,
and exit to the magazine straight
away (do not do anything else). If
you keep exiting to the mag your
income will go right up and you'll
have won the game,

Steven Benton of Kingsbridge, South

Stormlord and The Untouchables, but
would prefer pokes with an SYS

Gareth Meachin, Fareham, is interested
in a poke for Double Dragon II (See

James Aylott, Colchester, has a
problem with the ancient Americana

that every 5 levels there is a password,
but does not know when or where to

THE SCORING SYSTEM
ENGINE - This is how well the joystick is made
inside (ie. does it have micrdswitches or what?)
BODYWORK - This is how sturdy the joystick is, and
how much torture the exterior can take.
STEERING - This is how accurate it is directionally.
MILEAGE - This is how long the joystick will last
before conking out.
TOP SPEED - This is the overall rating for the stick.
All of the above ratings are given in MPH. The ﬁrst
four are marked out of 50 miles per hour, and then
this is added up to give a Top Speed.
After this in 'The Showroom' we give you an
indication of what car the joystick is most
comparable to.
The games we
tested the sticks on
were Continental
Circus - Virgin, and
Super Cars -
Gremlin. The
radically different
gameplay of these
should give us a
general idea of how
they perform (an all
over road-test if you
like).
THE ARCADE
ENGINE • Nice chunky
microswitches housed in a
tight environment. No
autoﬁre though. 35 MPH
BODYWORK - Fits very
neatly in your mitts, and
although there's only one
ﬁre-button, it's positioned at
exactly the right spot for left
handed players, aswell as
right handers. 45 MPH
STEERING - Very small
movements required leads to
responsive action. The shaft
is just the right length too.
45 MPH
MILEAGE - The base feels a
bit ﬂimsy, but the shaft has a
metal rod. The button may
fail in time, and there's no
other to fall back on. 39
MPH
TOP SPEED - A very neat
joystick that could travel
anywhere with you. It's
accuracy does it proud. 164

FLASHFIRE
BE-BOP
ENGINE - Leaf based
joystick which means you
don't know (by sound) if
you're pointing it in a
direction or not. The ﬁre
button is microswitched, but
again, there's no autoﬁre
(essential for today's
gaming). 25 MPH.
BODYWORK - Erm... Er... It's
truly crap! It
could be made of old cereal
packets and I'd be none the
wiser. 5 MPH
STEERING - It's the old
'stirring a bowl of soup'
syndrome, although the stick
itself has a strangely accurate
feel. 29 MPH
MILEAGE - Unless you keep
it in its box it'll probably fall
to bits within a month
(especially on a game like
Super Cars). 10 MPH
TOP SPEED - Not the
poorest joystick in the world
but not far behind, and is not
really

that Bondwell was the

A
may have been keen-
eyed enough to
notice a strange
occurrence in last months
hint section. A hint for a
game I have never
reviewed! A cock-up or an
incredible hints and tips
service with forward
planning? Erm...next
question.
I wonder if I've started a
trend? Hints before the
review appears, hmmm.
For the confused who did
notice the hint feel free to
peruse the full review of
this cracking RPG below.
At the moment it is on
import only. However,
several ﬂocks of Canada
Geese have informed me,
after two packets of bird
seed and four loaves of
Mother's Pride were
exchanged during heated
negotiations, that
Mindscape have an eye on
a European deal. S0000, if
you can hop from one foot
to t'other for a bit you may
ﬁnd The Magic Candle at a
reasonable price in the
near future. For the
impatient I recommend
getting in touch with
Computer Adventure World
and buying the import
version post haste, if not
sooner.

Arriving on two disks plus
a well produced, 60-page
manual, The Magic Candle
looks a little like an Ultima
mutation (graphically). Set
in the world of Deruvia The
Magic Candle holds
captive the evil Dreax.
Disaster seems inevitable
now as the guardians of
the candle have
disappeared and the
candle is burning down.
When it disappears Dreax
is free to do a bit of the
ol'maiming and killing.
Your team must save
Deruvia.
The Magic Candle
(TMC) may look pretty iffy,
graphically, by today's
standards but the main
attractions lie within the
design. For example, the
boring method of hack'n
slash is kept down to a
bare minimum as the game
concentrates upon
puzzles, plot and role-
playing which is what the
RPGs are all about, after
all. Also, you will ﬁnd a
limit to the numbers of
monsters. They are only re-
generated when a "new
patrol" enters the area -
about every three game
months. However,
dungeons have a ﬁxed
number of monsters. Once
they're dead there's no
more.
In addition characters
are ready-made. There is
no character creation, from
scratch, routines here
because, say Mindcraft, a
bunch of numbers do not
give "character" or
personality.
A major feature is the
option of splitting your
party into several pieces.
So when you enter town
you can send a couple of
your team off to work for
some cash, others to train
in different types of
warfare, others may wish

There's nothing more
frightening than a
fully luminated Paul
Rigby, and that's
what we get this
month thanks to the

to hit the tavern to collect
info and so on.
Splitting the party is
mostly done inside the
town. However, you can
leave a character behind
(out of your party of six)
because combat can still
be successful with ﬁve
characters. The chap left in
town could be learning
spells or working for
someone. This is an ideal
method of earning money,
for the party. So when the
party returns you've got a
bunch of cash you can use,
from your character's
earnings (through skills
such as a tailor or
gemcutter). in addition,
though, there is one part
late in the game where you
will need to split your party
into three pieces in order
to solve a puzzle.
When you enter the
combat routine you will
see another good design
aspect of TMC - the enemy
intelligence varies (they
each have an intelligence
rating) but when you do
meet intelligent opposition
they use speciﬁc tactics.
They appear to realise who
your weakest people are,
single out your wizards as
a priority kill, etc.,
There is a good use of
slats such as individual
weapon skills: bow, skill,
sword skill, etc. Magic can
only be learnt from books
and the included spells
only learnt from
uninterrupted periods of
concentration. Once a
spell has been cast it has
to be re-learnt. Good, this
prevents the magic users
dominating the game.
Mega-powerful
weapons are few and far
between in TMC. There are
enhanced weapons but you
will never ﬁnd a powerful
weapon randomly. There is

one p o we rfu l item but only
the hero can ca rry it and it
is limited. I ﬁnd it is no big
deal to not have them.
Such ite ms can result in an
unbalanced game.
One o r two of these
features (there are many
more that I've not had a
chance to mention) ma y
have been seen in other
games but you wo n 't have
seen th e m all in one
release, and certainly not
as well integrated.
TMC does have its
faults, though. Co mb a t can
drag on a bit and the nifty
splitting of the party could
have been better
implemented (I believe this
feature will be improved
for the sequel) However,
the faults are not glaring
and do not interfere with
the g a me 's enjoyment.
Probably the high point to
TMC is the end sequence
which is one of mo st
satisfying end-games seen
in any RPG so far. It is nice
to see a game designed
with a bit of thought, care
and attention. Bu y it and
then brace yourself for the
sequel.
OVERALL ! : : . )  Va
IT'S
WICK-ED!
So who are Mindcraft? Ali
Atabek, "Mindcraft started
about two years ago, there
were three of us at the
time. Myself, Ugur Atabek
(my wife) and James
Thomas. We have
developed one title before
The Ma g ic Candle [TMC -
from now on] developed for
SSI called Rings of Zilﬁn. It
wasn't terribly successful.
But successful enough to
encourage us to try again."
I asked Ali where the
idea for TMC actually
originated,
"Oh, that's obscured by
time, it's now been four
years. Some of it is in the
Rings of Zilﬁn. Anyone who
has played Zilﬁn will
recognise certain features
that were present in both.
Such as the mushrooms.
There were many things I
would have liked to
changed in Zilﬁn, but
couldn't because the
design was locked at that
time. So when I had a
chance to start all over we
had Ma g ic Candle."
TMC viewpoint is the
classic "Ultima" type look-
down. Wh y choose that
viewpoint and not The
Bard's Tale ﬁrst-person
viewpoint?,
"That was a personal
preference on my part. I've
always enjoyed Ultima
more than Bard's.
Speaking of "inﬂuences",
I'm sure the inﬂuence of
Ultima is there. That cannot
be helped because Ultima
is the classic, they did it
ﬁrst."
One of the main reasons
for the Ultima viewpoint is
that Ali always gets lost in
the Bard's Tale-type
games! I can sympathise!
Ali added,
"I ﬁnd it painful. You
have to map. I know that,
nowadays they are coming
out with automapping but
even that doesn't seem to
help. I always found it more
enjoyable when I played
the top-view games."
A refreshing aspect of
TMC is that magic users
are actually allowed to
wear armour and ca rry
substantial weapons. A real
change from the normal
game which has your
wizard clad in a drafty
cloak and a wimp ish
dagger to protect him when
he's run out of spell points,
or whatever. Wh y was that
decision taken, was it
sympathy for magic-
users?,
"[Laughing] In a way, I
guess. If a wizard is willing
to we a r armour, why
shouldn't he be able to? If
they run out of spells what
are they going to do? Wait
to be zapped o r cut down?
Why can't they start
swinging something?
Clearly, they're not going
to be good at it, their skill
is we ll limited. But at least
they'll have a ﬁghting
chance."
As Ali has mentioned
above, their old game
"Rings of Zilﬁn" included
mushrooms, plants and
herbs which gave beneﬁcial
effects. A simila r feature is
included in TMC (I mu st
emphasise, at this point,
that TMC is not a Zilﬁn
clone, it is vastly different).
So why mushrooms?
This is very
embarrassing. Many people
ask me that question. I
think people expect me to
say that they're related to
drugs or something. It's not
true. I don't know, I had to
think of something and that
just popped [ahem - Paul]
into my mind. There's no
big reason behind it. I
certainly have no desire
that they be related to
drugs or anything like
that."
Right, fo llo w me down
into the dungeons. Dark
isn't it? Notice something,
besides the rats, that is?
Hmmm? Yes, that's right,
where's the automapping?,
"We did provide one
mechanism which gives
you an overall map of the
dungeon. But you have to
solve a puzzle ﬁrst."
One min o r criticism I
had, in the town, was that I
could have done with more
signs to tell me where
things were situated. All's
response to my request?,
"Everybody's asking for
it and you got it! It's going
to be there in the sequel
(see elsewhere). It was too
late to put it in TMC by the
time we realised."
MC2 -
EXCLUSIVE!
In Magic Candle 2, you
will travel into the lands of
the enemy. The plot
surrounds the missing
guardians mentioned in
the review, who you will
have to rescue. The title
of the game will be called
"The Magic Candle 2 -
The Four and Forty". The
latter being the guardians.
Graphics will be much
improved as Mindcraft
have a new artist.
A very interesting
ability, in the sequel, is
the option to have a
detailed conversation
with your party. You will
be able to hear advice
from your party. For
example, if you are in a
• particular location, one of
your party may have
actually been there before
so he can give you a few
tips about possible
enemies or traps.

reality" screamed
the press invite
which showed two
silhouetted ﬁgures wearing
strange helmets and looking
like some more other-worldly
cast members of Aliens.
Time moved on... Walk
through this bin-bag tunnel,
they said. Wear this badge,
they said. Drink this beer,
they said. Watch this promo
video, they said. Listen to this
man, they said. Sit down and
put this helmet on, they
said...
...And suddenly I was in
the cockpit of a harrier. Well,
a computer-generated harrier
anyhow. A vertical take-off,
the ground slipping away
beneath me and a roar of jets
from behind. I moved my
head, looking up and around,
and spotted ﬁve bandits
passing, to swoop in front of
my plane - and in front of my
sights... a burst of machine
gun ﬁre ﬁnishes off one or
two of them. A click on the
second joystick and a missile
speeds off to destroy another
plane. And a
refuelling sequence before
more jets over the blue
ocean. Then everything
swims out of view...
Reality is back, the helmet
has been removed by a ﬂight-
suited W Industries operative.
So it's on from V-TOL (that's
the name of the game, as
Abba said) to Battlesphere.
On goes the helmet again...
And it's into deep space
for a real battle. A stereo
guitar rock soundtrack sears
from the headphone
speakers as stars swish by.
In this game, the gun sights
were ﬁxed, a true point-and-
ﬁre HUD, and laser death was
amply forthcoming. Star
ﬁghters soared into view and
were blasted to space-debris.
What a game, wow, yeah...
And back again to reality.
An opportunity, perhaps, to
talk about the hardware
involved.
For the sit-down leisure
'Virtuality' game, players sit
(as you would expect!) in a
huge moulded plastic seat
(which has a screen set into it
so other
players can see what
you're seeing). They grasp a
joystick in each hand and
have the special 'Visette'
helmet placed on their head.
This looks like a welding
helmet with a cross between
a small car burnper and some
cool strip-shades fused to
the front.
The difference between all
this and a normal arcade
game comes with the view
you get. As you move your
head, so what you can see
changes appropriately. If you
move your head around to
the right, your view follows
and the same with left, up
and down, even diagonals.
It's different and really quite
good!
The 'Virtuality'
system has an interesting
companion in its stand-up
counterpart, which won't be
available in arcades. Using a
different unit, the same
helmet design, and a joystick
or a special glove, players
can move about in an
artiﬁcial environment, actually
interacting with objects.
Watching someone doing this
is quite funny - they move
their head about and grip thin
air and look quite mad. It's
only when you see the screen
on the unit does it all make
sense, as you see what they
see. This is intended for
serious business and
research use, although it

C
Detective is a version
of the old
Waddingtons board game
Clued°, and before now was
only available in America. But
now us under-privileged Brits
get the chance to try it on our
faithful American 64s.
You have a choice of ten
players, all of which can be
controlled by the three
different skill levels of
computer, or by humans, or a
mixture of the two (by that I
don't mean a crossbreed
between a human and a
computer). Although you
must have a minimum of
three players otherwise the
game would become too
easy.
After you've picked one of
the characters, the computer
will roll the dice for you and
you can move your detective
about the board. To win the
game you must establish who
the murderer is, the murder
weapon and the scene of the
murder. To do this you will
have to look at the set of
cards held by each active
player.
There are two ways of
looking at a players' cards,
the ﬁrst way is to accuse a
player of the murder, then the
players holding the cards you
selected must show them,
the second way is to move
onto a magnifying glass
square, then you can look at
one of any players cards.
Each of the cards will have
either a room, a weapon or a

suspect on them. The only
three cards which are not
held by a player are the cards
holding the solution to the
murder.
To help you remember
which cards you have or
haven't seen, Master
Detective has provided a
check list on which all the
suspects, murder weapons,
and rooms are written down.
Each time you you are shown
a card by another player an X
is placed next to it by the
computer, so you can
eliminate it from your
inquires. It is possible to
eliminate a card by watching
other players accuse each
other of murders. For
instance if Mrs Peacock
accused Colonel Mustard of
murder with poison in the
billiard room, and Mr Green,
Miss Scarlet and Mrs
Peacock each had a card,
although you would not see
these cards, you would know
that the billiard room, the

poison and the Colonel
Mustard cards can be
eliminated.
Graphicaly this game is
okay, with each card having
its own picture on it. The
sound is made up of
annoying footsteps when you
move your piece and boring
beeps when you pull down a
menu. The computer even on
it's hardest skill is easily
beaten and if you play a
friend you have to keep
putting your hands up to the
screen to stop him from
seeing your cards when you
turn them over.
Personally, I think that
board game to computer
game conversions are the
ultimate in boredom, and I
would prefer to spend time
picking ﬂuff off my carpet
rather than playing them. My
advice to you is only buy this
game if you enjoyed playing
Clued° so much you
are itching to play
another version.
Not the world's best effort in advanced home
computer entertainment. Best played if
you've got real dedication.

PASSING
SHOT
ENCORE £2.99
Anyone for tennis? Phoar,
phoar, phoarlll Strawberries
and cream, please! Guffahl
It's that time of the year that
all the software companies
raise a racket and have a
ball. And Encore's attempt at
capturing the Wimbledon
brigade (the tennis, not
muddy football down Plough
lane) is a rerelease of an
Imageworks coin-op
conversion.
To be completely honest,
I've never been too keen on
the coin-op of Passing Shot.
It was a bit simplistic, the
action wasn't as furious as
'Nuns with Big Blasters' (or
similar), and the actual game
was as realistic as a dayglo
pink, plastic lawn. But it
seems as if the game's
appeal is much better suited
to the old commie,
especially at a budget price.
Before the actual game
starts you have to choose
your options. You can have
one or two players, although
the one player option is
actually a darn sight more
involved. If you do decide to
compete against the
computer, you'll be asked to
choose a skill level to start
on, and then it's on to the
court itself.
You start in France, and
you compete in the ﬁnals of
each famous tournament
(three in all) until you
reach Great Britain
and, obviously,
Wimbledon, where
you have to win the
quarter, semi, and
ﬁnal itself. If at any
stage you lose a
match you'll be out
of the game and
you'll have to start at
the beginning, but

TWEET,
TWEET'
fortunately, because this
would take absolutely yonks
otherwise, you only play one
set in each round.
The graphics are
reasonable, and the top down
viewpoint for the action is
pretty original (it was the ﬁrst
tennis game to adopt this).
The game is easy to play, and
the action is as smooth as it
comes. If you're a fan of two
geezers knocking their balls
about with large bats, you'll
simply 'love' Passing Shot.

very feeble effort. Even the
infamous Pro Mountain Bike
Simulator looks like Last
Ninja 3 when compared, the
only game that could touch it
for pure crappiness is Kenny
Dalglish Soccer Match, but
that's on full-price only. Well,
it's okay using the word
'crap' ﬁfty thousand times,
but what's the game really
like? And why is it so dam
abysmal?
You are Great Gurianos, a
bloke with a shield and a
sword, and you have to move
your shield and sword in
order to avoid being hit and
fried by a ﬁreball (or any othe
hazard), and bash the
occasionally appearing
similarly endowed fellows.
The background scrolls on
it's own as you do your Nazi
goose-step along, and every
so often you can pick up
something that falls at your
feet. And if there's more to it
than that, I can't say I'm sorry
to have missed it.
The most humourous
thing is that this is a coin-op
conversion, and the fact that
nobody on earth has heard of
the arcade machine it comes
from is anything but amazing.
If I wanted to buy a turd for
two pounds and ninety nine
pennies I'd pop into a joke
shop and get a plastic one.

T

occasional series
devoted to producing
your own fanzine. Rather
than diving straight into the
nitty gritty of recommending
software, hardware and all
that we at YC thought that
we would be a right bunch of
smartar..., er sensible
chappies by giving you a
number of ﬁrst-hand
accounts as to just what is
involved. There are a number
of reasons for this. Firstly,
reading about someone
else's mistakes saves your

own, also many fanzine

you that there are Nany
ways to tackle the
production of a fanzine.
There are no hard-and f
rules.
Two issues ago you
remember that I chatted t
that Welsh Lovely - Mandy
Rodrigues. editor of
Adventure Probe. This month
I sat on the doorstep of the
Right Honorable Jeffrey Davy
(contributor to this very meg.
and soon-to-be Editor, no-less)
and asked him to tell me
about The Bug. Otherwise I
would pinch the cream from
his Gold Top.
The Bug was the snappy
name for one of the ﬁrst
computer fanzines around.
Initially devoted to the
Spectrum it diversiﬁed to
include many other formats
including the dear or C64.
But what were its origins?
When did the ﬁrst issue
appear? Jeffrey: "Let's think,
it was August 1984 - which, I
believe made us the ﬁrst
computer games fanzine. We
thought, "Well, why not?".
We didn't know anything
about fanzines, I didn't really
know what a fanzine was, we
wanted to do a magazine
and that was that."
So along with Jaron
Lewis, his brother Kelsey
and Alice Fage they started
The Bug on a fortnightly
basis, which receded to
monthly and then, "...merely
regularly"
Towards the end of its life
it drifted to become more of
a quarterly. Apparently the
lengthening time scale was
nothing to do,with a lack of
interest bur more .to do with
the-increasing complexity of..

'13u0Oss born through
c interest in computers
'the wish to emulate the
glossies. A sort of 1 can do
that" attitude: "As I recall, we
were concerned that the
magazines around at the
time were not giving
accurate reviews - games
getting 90 % when we
thought they were turkeys,
for example."
With the wish to place a
sort of protest vote and
absolutely no experience in
editing, professional writing,
magazine production and so
on, The Bug No.1 stumbled
out, via an ancient Apple II
computer. The next few
issues were all type written

Datel's Action Replay (more,
of which, in a later issue).
Jeffrey Davy also used
other techniques to ﬁt
screenshots onto paper. "We
even moved on to screening
photographs because the
community centre had a
special process camera.

Then, when they were
unable to afford the outlay,
they wandered around the
queues outside the
Microfair and sold it there!
Local shops were
approached and individual
deals negotiated. Basically
arranging that the shop take
a cut of the sales the
magazine produced. Other
methods of gaining publicity
coincided with the fanzine
boom so The Bug was
mentioned in the likes of
Crash and Amtix, TV
programs like Get Fresh and
Splash (remember them?)
and trade magazines like
CTW (mainly because the
members of The Bug would
continually write and
complain about different
aspects of computers such
as sexism in computer
games and so on). The
breaking of CSD also
attracted media coverage in
the trade mags.

Dynamite Dux.
We liJà e  Musashi you've got
yourself in a bit of a mess.
You, the master Graduate
from Ninja school, have let
the evil and sinister Bwah
Foo walk all over you and
kidnap some of your
students, and needless to
say that when their parents
ﬁnd out they will be very
angry indeed. So pick up
your ninja stars, and your
magic wand, and shove
Shinobi into your cassette
machine.
I'm surprised that while
playing Shinobi that I found
it more playable than the
amiga version (but then,
aren't ALL commie 64
1111LI1111 111 IRMIrn
games). The game involves
sneaking about on a level
full to the brim with baddies,
and trying to rescue your
miniature ninja graduates,
but you must be careful
'cause you can only survive
one or two blows (depending
on what type they were).
Although you're not
completely defenseless as
you're able to kill a man just
by kicking him in his leg,
also you have an unlimited
supply of ninja stars which
will become more powerful
weapons as you collect more
and more ninja nippers, and
ﬁnally you have a magic
weapon which disintegrates
every baddie on the screen.
One annoying thing
about the game is the
control for jumping on top of
buildings, which is hold
down the ﬁre key for about
ﬁve seconds after ﬁring an
ninja star then move the
joystick up. In the
instructions it just says ﬁre
and up. This game has
reasonable graphics and
sound, and is deﬁnitely not
lacking in the speed stakes.
NINJA
WARRIORS
This next game 'The Ninja
Warriors could be the birth of
a brand new craze. Instead of
being Robocop or a Ninja
Turtle you are a Roboninja -
well actually you're not,
you're somebody else who
has been chosen to control
this particular roboninja from
a very sophisticated, and up
to date, computer terminal
called a Commodore 64 (of
course).
"But why?" I hear you ask,
"Why do I have to control this
ninja construction kit?" Well
the reason is that a scientist
called Mulk bumped into you
on the street one day and
said "Hey, do you want to
control my roboninja, •
constructed from the ﬁnest
molybdeno-tinanium, on an
assassination of President
Bangler?" "Yep", you said,
and that's how the whole
thing started.
The Ninja Warriors is
another ﬁghting game in
the same kind of style
as Shinobi. This time
you have limited
supply of ninja stars,
only thirty which will
disappear very fast if
you waste them on the
baddies that can be
1
easily decapitated with one
slash of your specially
sharpened ninja knife.
Happily, being a roboninja,
you are not as easily
destroyed as you have a full
bar of energy.
Unlike Shinobi, you also
have the opportunity of two
players playing at once. But
will two roboninjas be enough
to wipe out all the Soldiers-
with knifes, guns, and
bazookas - the dogs, the big
weird creatures that are hard
to kill, and the ninjas? Good
graphics, sound and variety
make this game one you will
keep coming back to.

DOUBLE
DRAGON
If you hadn't heard of Double
Dragon II before, you may be
thinking that this is a game in
which you and a friend take
control of a dragon each. If
you were thinking that, you
would be much mistaken. In
fact, you control two humans
named Billy and Jimmy. So
why isn't it called Double
Human? The answer to that
probably lies in some ancient
tome buried under Rik's desk,
so we'll never ﬁnd out!
Double Dragon II is
another arcade ﬁghting game
conversion in which you are
able to have two players on
the screen together to help
each other. Your arch enemy
Willy, who, you may
remember from Double
Dragon's ﬁrst appearance, as
the big guy with the machine
gun. Yes, you may have killed
him ﬁrst time round but he
has been brought back to life
m ff 1
with magic - as have his gang
members - and he's taken
away Marian and killed her.
You and Billy must travel the
sideways scrolling screen
once again and kill off the
gang members with weapons
such as grenades, knifes,
whips and crates.
This game is hardly an
arcade perfect conversion but
you wouldn't expect that from
our humble C64 (not in 1989
anyway!). I personally don't
think that Double Dragon II
should have ever been
attempted to be converted to
the 64, if anybody wanted the
same graphics, sound, size of
characters, and speed of the
arcade. Apart from that it's
reasonable ﬁghting action,
just don't expect the
same quality as the
arcade version.
DYNAMITE
DUX
Dynamite Dux is yet another
ﬁghting game with cartoon
like sprites. With this game
you must control one duck
called Bin, to whom's wings
some nasty cruel person has
stapled boxing gloves. But
although this means he can't
ﬂy, he's got a cracking left
hook!
Well drawn colourful
cartoon like sprites such as
Fires, Sumo Pigs, Boxing
Crocs, packs of rats and
many more, make this game
enjoyable to play. Also, the
variety of weapons is good.
you can collect bombs,
rocket launchers (various
types), stones, ﬂame
throwers and not forgetting
your famous punch. You
must avoid obstacles like
holes in the road and cliffs
that you can fall off. But every
game has its nylon
lining (or was that
every cloud has
its silver
lining?), the
sound isn't
up to much
and the
background
is usually
pretty dull
(which takes
away from the
cartoon-like
theme of the game),
but the good points
(incredible gameplay, two-
player option, etc.) do out-
way the bad points.
Fists of Fury Ills a good
compilation and a
must for ﬁghting
freaks every where.
I l l
A stonky package of four furious beaties. Switch
your brain off and just rely on pure muscle 1

U
the Year began last
issue, only YC's
Editorial staff had this much
computer game-related tosh
in their heads. But now they
want to show just how smug
they are by testing four
sections of the computer
games world. Last month it
was PR-types and now...
THE CONTESTANTS:
Joe Bonar
(Probe Software):
Joe has worked on most of
Probe's games, such as
Savage, Turbo OutRun and
Viz. He doesn't actually
program any more. "I ﬁx
bugs" he says. He denies
ever owning a pair of brown
corduroy trousers although, "I
had a pair of fawn cords, they
weren't brown, honest!".
Carl Muller
(Freelanceilmageworks):
The C64 Turtles game was
Carl's baby, so blame him.
On his desk is a PC and a
C64, "with a return key that
doesn't work" he laments. His
musical tastes are Jimi
Somerville, Erasure, Marc
Almond and Abba. Er, right!
Richard Taylor
(Freelance/VC):
Frosty the Snowman was
written by YC's very own
Richard and he's currently
working on a sequel_ He
certainly doesn't wear brown
cords and claims that his
desk contains "Paper, Cups,
Half-dried sandwiches and
biscuits". What a guy.
Jason Page (Graftgold):
He's programmed Off Road
Racer, amongst other 64
games and works with
Andrew Braybrook (Uridium,
etc.). On his desk is "Lots of
paper, packets of Hob-Nobs,
A cube of chalk and a Rubik's
clock." He doesn't drive a
Porsche, he drives a Ferrari,
no, er... "I drive my dad's car,
a Datsun Sunny" he says.
Stan Schembri (System 3):
Programmed Barbarian,
Cauldron II, Last Ninja 3 and
loads of other good stuff. He
drives a BMW MS and says
-
pink lurex jockstrap and a
black leather cap, with a gold
chain!" That's the spirit!
Bobby Earle (Ocean):
Bobby is 20 and has already
written parts of Total Recall
for Ocean. Now he's working
on the 64 version of
Terminator II. Asked if it will
trash the competition he says
"It certainly will!"

were downright cheeky
in the way that they got
the answer to Question

phone to YC's own
question-master, another
Probe bod, Mark Kelly,
rang Rik on YC's other
line and asked what the
name of our letters Ed
was! Here at YC we
applaud initiative and
outrageousness - so we
gave 'em the point! What
style!
But the winner, with a clean sweep... Joe Bonar - 19

Instead, an evil plan had been

was time to put away the but

The main reason for this

hippy, King Pamera, who's

compulsory wearing of ﬂares.

MIGHTY
the
process of doing so has
deknacked all the Mighty
brothers but one.
Jack is a bit strange, to be
honest. For a start he enjoys
nothing better than dressing
up in Mrs. Mighty's tablecloth
and putting his dad's
authentic Viking helmet
ashtray (bought in a service
station outside Newport
Pagnell) on his head (after
carefully discarding the old
cigar butts and rolled up
sweety wrappers). His other
particular fetish was collecting
bombs (so far he's picked up
several Molotov Cocktails,
one bazooka shell, and a sea
mine), and with the land
suddenly becoming so
peaceful, the lad was a triﬂe
upset - his hobby had been
ruined.
But now he's back, and
the nasty Beelzebut has
littered his pyramid (the place
where he has the hippy family
locked up) with Jack's
favourite pastime. And
it's bombs away for
some more
Bombjack fun, as
you've gotta
progress
through
billions (slight
exaggeration)
of levels of
bomb and
treasure
collecting in
order to ﬁnally
confront the
geezer with
sulphur breath
and rescue the
boring old fart and his
family.
Each level consists of
about ﬁve screens of platform
action, that scroll either
horizontally or vertically, and
are scattered with bombs to
be collected, treasure chests
to be opened, and meanies to
avoid. You don't have to do
anything but avoid the
nestles to get to the end of
each level, but you won't
come out of it with much of a
score.
It's worthwhile though, to
open the treasure chests as
you can grab treasure and
other bonuses. One of these
'icons' is a Mighty token, and
each one (up to three) can be
used to increase Bombjack's
powers. One Mighty token
will turn our little fellow blue
(ie. it has much the same
effect as if he'd been out in
the cold too long), thus giving
him the power to open locked
chests. Two will turn him
orange (ie. having much the
same effect as falling asleep
under a particularly strong
sunbed), and giving him the
power to open chests just by
walking into them. And three
Mighty tokens will turn him
green (le. it has much the
same effect as eating a
pickled onion and ice-cream
concoction) and will change
all of our Bombjack gobbling
meany friends into hard Ecus.
All of these powers are
limited though, so it's a good
idea to collect as many of
these little buggers as
possible.
At the end of the ﬁve or
so screens will be a doorway
that will either open by itself,
or open when you've
collected the 'sphinx' key.
Inside this door is an end-of-
level room (unlike an end-of-
level baddy), in which you
must revert back to the
original two games (in
gameplay terms) and collect
all the bombs to open the
second door in order to
escape. If you collect the
bombs in the order at which
they ﬁzz, you'll be awarded
oodles of bonus points, and
then it's onto the next level.
During the levels are
other doors that lead into
'bonus' rooms which
normally contain extra
chests to be opened. And if
you collect too many Mighty
tokens (I know I said you
should collect loads, but
there's a difference between
being sensible and being
greedy) you'll be sent to the
torture room, where you

have to avoid the bad guys
for as long as possible. If
you do manage to survive
though, your GDV rating
(Game Deviation Value - a
way of rating your skill and
ability during the game,
therefore giving you an extra
incentive apart from the
score) will go right down.
In all, Mighty Bombjack is
a marriage between the
original excellent games and
Super Mario Brothers. In true
cutesy fashion there are
extra chests to be found,
and bags of furious leaping
and bounding. The gameplay
is so addictive that I had to
be torn away from the
ioystick by the Fire brigade
(perhaps because somebody
had put superglue all over
the stick, the smegsl), and
the graphics and in-game
sounds are what we've
come to expect from such
games (impossamole,
Rainbow Islands, etc.). Elite
has been very, very quiet in
recent months (years?) but
seems to be back with as
much gusto as that which
brought us games like
Paperboy and Ghosts and
Goblins all them years ago.
It's a rare occasion when the
quality of the game is
broadcast in the title (and is
true), 'cause Bombjack in his
third guise is
unmistakably
Mighty.

a supply of magic
smart bombs, too.
And... Your Ninja
dog (not necessarily
called Rover), upon
your command, goes
to savage the
terrorists in your
path. You've read
about Rottweilers
and Pit Bulls, now
play the game (sick, sick!).
You negotiate horizontally
and vertically scrolling levels
which are completed when
you reach the end having
found all the bombs along the
way. After two such levels,
you get to kill a Mr Medium-
Big, in the same way as you
would an R-Type baddy - by
ﬁring mercilessly at a weak
point (beating heart, ﬂashing
light, etc.).
Possibly the most fun bit
of it all is the bonus level. You
get a view of the side of a
skyscraper - it tapers into the
distance. There are three
ledges on which Ninjas walk
up and down in a Space
Invader style. They slowly
jump down the ledges and
you must Shuriken-them
before they jump off the
nearest ledge and end the
level. The Ninjas grow in size
as they come down (in true
perspective) and the ﬁnal

shot you get of the Ninja
jumping toward your head is
truly corking.
So, you're saying, how
does this particular Ninja
game compare to the billions
and billions of predecessors.
Well, the graphics are a mite
odd; The Ninja (as Rik
remarked in the preview of
this 'un) looks like he's
chortling as he chucks the
stars and has a particularly
hippy-esque hairstyle and the
dog looks as though it's
licking the baddies rather
than ruthlessly savaging
them with its large chops.
But other than that, they're
quit e Spitting.
Shadow Danc er is a nice
conversion, fairly faithful to
the arcade (where's the
screen with all the ﬂames for
the magic-casting bit,
eh US Gold?), darn hard
and, so, worth a look.

e r... Dick Tracy,
in the all action
conversion of the ﬁlm
of the same name,
featuring Dick, Tess
Trueheart (his squeeze),
Lips Manlis (deceased),
Big Boy Caprice (well
known villain) and
Pruneface (assistant to
well known villain). Of
course you realise that
means you are missing
out on Madonna as
Breathless Mahoney, so
when the blurb
accompanying the
game claims it follows
the script, I just wonder
which script that was.
Let's face it, Madonna
plays a bloody big part
in the ﬁlm. Maybe Titus
couldn't afford her.
Dick (the game)
starts off in much the
same way as Dick (the
ﬁlm) with Dick (the
character) investigating
the murder of Lips
Manlis. The ﬁnger is
pointing at Big Boy
Caprice, especially
since the deeds to The
Ritz Club, owned by
Lips, had been
transferred to Big Boy
on the day of his
demise. What happens
next is anyone's guess
since the instructions
consist of a pseudo-
newspaper highlighting
the events and main
characters. So what do
you do, what's the
objective then. What in
fact is the point of the
game? Er, dunno, you
better ring Titus and
ask them. I hope you
can speak French
though, 'cos they ain't
English.
Well once you get
going it becomes pretty
obvious what you're
supposed to be doing
anyway, and since
phonecalls outside the
UK cost a fortune
thanks to those
thieving bar stewards
at BT (did you know my
phone bill was MOO!
Outrageous I call it.
Flagrant proﬁteering.
Taking the shirt of the
backs of hard working
men and women, the

to the right end, and

TRACY
then a new screen
appears with you on the
left. With a bit of luck
you might ﬁnd a
weapon before you get
killed, which happens
all too often.
You have an energy
bar and you can thump
people, but even if you
do they still generally
absorb some of your
life force (vampire
gangsters?), which
makes the game
tedious.
If you pick up a
weapon it's either the
single shot gun, or the
machine gun. There's
not much difference in
performance, and a
gangster with a small
hole in his head is just
as dead as a gangster
with no head.

ﬁlm was about roaches), but if you
cough up the dash for this poor game,

E  Al I E lAt
It's hell doncha know - all this
reviewing lark. R ik H e n d e r s o n  sits
in a MacD onalds in Milton Keynes
city centre and ponders why
anybody would w ant to make a
game out of it...
irstly, its a bit of a smeg
r
space craft goes belly
over tit, but things can get
worse (and undoubtedly do),
and it's unsurprising that you
ﬁnd yourself stranded on
what can be described as the
most perilous planet ever to
have spewed from he (or she)
that made the universe.
Fortunately, you've
managed to scramble out of
the wreckage with a fraggin'
enormous blaster, and
enough ammo to lay waste to
the entire population of China
(as long as China has only
three people and one dog,
with a gammy leg, living in the
country. It doesn't? Oh well,
there goes my geography
GCSE). But even though
you've had this lucky (?)
break, it's hardsville from here
to safety. And there's so
many aliens to blast that
you'd better rearrange your
lunch date for next year,
'cause it'll take you until then
to get there.
Hell Hole is the ﬁrst
release from On-
Line Entertainment, which is
basically the defunct CRL
tarted up and re-named (even
the main title screen for the
game has CRL plastered all
over the place). It also,
unfortunately, sees a return to
the days when CRL was really
struggling, and its games
were anything but epic, and
Hell Hole is anything but epic.
This isn't because the
graphics are nail, no siree. In
fact they're a bit wicked, and
could be likened to a good
Thalamus game (Hawkeye,
Delta, etc.). Its the crap
gameplay that gives me
chronic indegestion.
What you have to do is
travel along a horizontally
scrolling (left-to-right)
landscape, blasting the waves
of aliens that pour at you, and
leap over the occasional
chasm that appears in the,
obviously, WI  ﬁtted ﬂoor.
This is really all there is to it.
You can collect lots of chunky
icons that give you all kinds of
power-ups and the
occasional more meaty
weapon, and sometimes a

Although it's all
reasonably playable, its a tad
too hard, and a tad too

me of Turtican, but is a very
poor substitute indeed, and

UNWATCHABLE IN
PURSUIT OF THE
UNFILMABLE
The Month's big news for
action-movie fans (and Ocean
staff) is that everyones' favourite
(except mine, natch) chrome-
plated crime-buster will return in
ROBOCOP 3, presumably being
made following ROBOFLOP 2's
success on video.
Regulars Nancy Allen and
Dan O'Herlihy are already
signed to the picture (which
reputedly includes Robo
battling not one but ﬁve ED-
209s!) but this time they are
without the silver guy himself,
since Peter Weller is tied up
with David (THE FLY)
Cronenberg's latest
masterpiece, an adaptation of
William S Borroughs'
"unﬁlmable THE NAKED
LUNCH", a nightmarish
fantasy populated with
"spies", junkies, witches and
shape-changing monsters".
Yikes!
THIRD TIME
TURKEY
Two more third-installment
movies with plenty of news are
ALIEN III (not ALIENS III as
misreported elsewhere) and
HIGHLANDER 3: THE
MAGICIAN.
By the time you read this,
the former will have wrapped at
Buckinghamshire's Pinewood
Studios, but it's still anybody's .%
guess as to what the end of
movie holds for us. The last
script insiders were given had
Ripley (Sigoumey Weaver)
waking after a crash-landing on
a colony planet run by shaven -
headed monks to ﬁnd that Newt
and Hicks (survivors from
ALIENS) have been murdered
and that
android (or 'artiﬁcial person')
Bishop has disappeared.
Investigating all this, she
discovers a nameless curt
experimenting with the aliens
and hoping to breed the next
Alien Queen inside her... One
top secret version of the script
has a crop-haired Ms. Weaver
dousing herself in rocket fuel
and setting herself ablaze,
determined that (a) the Queen
will never be born, and (b) they
won't make ALIEN IV. What I
can tell you is that David
Fletcher (who made Madonna's
Vogue video) is directing, and
that Charles Dance and Dutton
co-star. The bad news is that,
Ripley aside, none of the
survivors of the exquisite
ALIENS return.
Similarly, Christopher
Lambert has expressed no
interest in reprising his role as
Connor McLeod in
HIGHLANDER 3: THE
MAGICIAN — not surprising
after the mess Russ Mulcahy
made of 2: THE QUICKENING.
The third ﬁlm, therefore,
concentrates on McLeod's son,
Connor Jr. (Christian Slater from
HEATHERS, YOUNG GUNS II
and PUMP UP THE VOLUME),
who sets out in search of his
father and the identity of the
mysterious 'Magician'. He is
accompanied by a hologram of
Ramirez (played one again by
Sean Connery, of courshe!), but
only while Fox have unused
footage of the great
Shcotshman left over from the
last one!
And don't even think of 7
asking me about CHILD'S
PLAY 3...
SIX OF THE
WORST
And if it wasn't depressing
enough having three
movies from one half-
baked idea, how does six
sound? By now, sixth
installments of the STAR
TREK, 'ELM STREET and
THE HOWLING sagas are all
on the way.
STAR TREK VI: VOYAGE
INTO INFINITY, which reunites
the usual 'old generation' cast
for a trip through a black hole,
celebrates the 25th anniversary
of the story. Joining Shatner,
Doohan, Kelly arid Nimoy (who
is also executive producer) are
Jack (YOUNG GUNS, BATMAN)
Palance and Christian Slater
(again!), both playing Klingons,
and Whoopie (GHOST)
Goldberg, reprising for the big
screen the barmaid she vowed
TV audiences with in the fourth
season of Star Trek: The Next
Generation...
Freddy Krueger takes on a
new dimension in New Line's
FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL
NIGHTMARE, still shooting in
LA. Robert Englund dons the
glittery glove once again, but
this time the never-popular kid
killer is to be ﬁlmed in "Freddy
Vision", a state-of-the-art 3-0
process. Gold knows how co-
star Roseanne Barr will look in
three dimensions, but Alice
Cooper (as Freddy's stepfather)
should provide some much-
needed comic relief.
HOWLING VI: THE FREAKS
will probably be in video shops

earlier start now that he's

depicting Pan (Robin [GOOD
