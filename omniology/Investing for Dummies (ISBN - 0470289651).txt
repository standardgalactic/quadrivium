Praise for Eric Tyson’s Bestselling 
For Dummies Titles
“Eric Tyson For President!!! Thanks for such a wonderful guide. With a clear, 
no-nonsense approach to . . . investing for the long haul, Tyson’s book says it 
all without being the least bit long-winded. Pick up a copy today. It’ll be your 
wisest investment ever!!!”
 
— Jim Beggs, VA
“Eric Tyson is doing something important — namely, helping people at all 
income levels to take control of their financial futures. This book is a natu-
ral outgrowth of Tyson’s vision that he has nurtured for years. Like Henry 
Ford, he wants to make something that was previously accessible only to the 
wealthy accessible to middle-income Americans.”
 
— James C. Collins, coauthor of the national bestsellers 
Built to Last and Good to Great
“The organization of this book is superb! I could go right to the topics of imme-
diate interest and find clearly written and informative material.”
 
— Lorraine Verboort, Beaverton, OR
“Among my favorite financial guides are . . . Eric Tyson’s Personal Finance For 
Dummies.”
 
— Jonathan Clements, The Wall Street Journal
“In Investing for Dummies, Tyson handily dispatches both the basics . . . and the 
more complicated.”
 
— Lisa M. Sodders, The Capital-Journal
“Smart advice for dummies . . . skip the tomes . . . and buy Personal Finance For 
Dummies, which rewards your candor with advice and comfort.”
 
— Temma Ehrenfeld, Newsweek
“You don’t have to be a novice to like Mutual Funds For Dummies. Despite the 
book’s chatty, informal style, author Eric Tyson clearly has a mastery of his 
subject. He knows mutual funds, and he knows how to explain them in simple 
English.”
 
— Steven T. Goldberg, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine

“Eric Tyson . . . seems the perfect writer for a …For Dummies book. He doesn’t 
tell you what to do or consider doing without explaining the why’s and 
how’s — and the booby traps to avoid — in plain English. . . . It will lead you 
through the thickets of your own finances as painlessly as I can imagine.”
 
— Clarence Peterson, Chicago Tribune
“Personal Finance For Dummies is the perfect book for people who feel guilty 
about inadequately managing their money but are intimidated by all of the 
publications out there. It’s a painless way to learn how to take control.”
 
— Karen Tofte, producer, National Public Radio’s Sound Money

About the Author
Eric Tyson is an internationally acclaimed and best-selling personal finance 
author, lecturer, and advisor. Through his work, he is dedicated to teaching 
people to manage their money better and to successfully direct their own 
investments.
Eric is a former management consultant to businesses for which he helped 
improve operations and profitability. Before, during, and after this time of 
working crazy hours and traveling too much, he had the good sense to focus 
on financial matters.
He has been involved in the investing markets in many capacities for more 
than three decades. Eric first invested in mutual funds back in the mid-1970s, 
when he opened a mutual fund account at Fidelity. With the assistance of Dr. 
Martin Zweig, a now-famous investment market analyst, Eric won his high 
school’s science fair in 1976 for a project on what influences the stock mar-
ket. In addition to investing in securities over the decades, Eric has also suc-
cessfully invested in real estate and started and managed his own business. 
He has counseled thousands of clients on a variety of investment quandaries 
and questions.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in economics at Yale and an MBA at the 
Stanford Graduate School of Business. Despite these impediments to lucid 
reasoning, he came to his senses and decided that life was too short to spend 
it working long hours and waiting in airports for the benefit of larger 
companies.
An accomplished freelance personal finance writer, Eric is the author of 
numerous best-selling books including For Dummies books on personal 
finance, mutual funds, taxes (coauthor), and home buying (coauthor) and is a 
syndicated columnist. His work has been featured and quoted in hundreds of 
national and local publications, including Newsweek, Kiplinger’s Personal 
Finance Magazine, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, The Wall Street 
Journal, and Bottom Line/Personal, and on NBC’s Today Show, ABC, CNBC, 
PBS’s Nightly Business Report, CNN, CBS national radio, Bloomberg Business 
Radio, National Public Radio, and Business Radio Network. He’s also been a 
featured speaker at a White House conference on retirement planning.
To stay in tune with what real people care about and struggle with, Eric still 
maintains a financial counseling practice.

Dedication
Actually, before I get to the thank yous, please allow me a really major thank 
you and dedication.

Introduction
T
he dozen years since the first edition of this book was published have 
witnessed increased interest in and media coverage of the investment 
world. The Internet has established itself as a fixture within the home and 
office, along with all the investment-related stories, facts, figures, applica-
tions, and scams that reside there. You can’t flip through the channels on 
your television without running into a stock ticker at the bottom of your 
screen or a pitchman claiming that folks are just waiting to pay you to buy 
their property. And new books are published daily that claim to possess 
the secret to investing success. With all this attention, you may think that 
investing times have changed. But to a large degree, things haven’t changed 
all that much. Investments that were considered lousy years ago — products 
with high fees and commission — generally are still lousy today.
The best investment vehicles for building wealth — stocks, real estate, and 
small business — haven’t changed either. And you still need money to play 
in the investment world. Like the first edition of Investing For Dummies, the 
fifth edition of this national best-seller includes complete coverage of these 
wealth-building investments as well as other common investments, such as 
bonds. Here are the biggest changes in this edition:
 
 Completely revised and updated: I’ve freshened up the data and 
examples in this book to provide you the latest insights and analyses. 
Wondering what all the fuss is about with gold, oil, and other commodi-
ties? Seeking a way to invest in stocks without exposing yourself to 
tremendous risk? Curious about what an exchange-traded fund or hedge 
fund is and whether you should invest? Weighing whether it’s too risky 
or difficult to invest in real estate? Wondering what the best ways are 
to invest globally? Having trouble making sense of various economic 
indicators and what they mean to your investment strategy? Confused 
about how tax law changes should affect your investment strategies? 
Wanting to invest in a Health Savings Account (HSA) but don’t know 
why, where, or how? You can find the answers to these questions and 
many more in this edition.
 
 Investing resources: With the continued growth in Web sites, software, 
publications, media outlets, and many other information sources offer-
ing investing advice and information, you’re probably overwhelmed 
about how to choose among the numerous investing research tools and 
resources. Equally problematic is knowing whom you can trust and 
listen to — and whom you need to ignore. I explain how to evaluate the 
quality of current investment tools and resources, and I provide tips for 
whom to listen to and whom to tune out.

Investing For Dummies, 5th Edition 
How Savvy Investors Build Wealth
As a financial counselor, I know from working with people of modest and 
immodest economic means that the time-tested ways they use to increase 
their wealth are by doing the following:
 
 Living within their means and systematically saving and investing 
money, ideally in a tax-favored manner
 
 Buying and holding a diversified portfolio of stocks
 
 Building their own small business or career
 
 Investing in real estate
That kind of investing is what this book is all about. Equally, if not more, 
important, I help you understand and choose investments compatible with 
your personal and financial goals.
You don’t need a fancy college or graduate-school degree, and you don’t 
need a rich dad (or mom), biological or adopted! What you do need is a 
desire to read and practice the many simple yet powerful lessons and 
strategies in this book.
Seriously, investing intelligently isn’t rocket science. By all means, if you’re 
dealing with a complicated, atypical issue, get quality professional help. 
But educate yourself first. Hiring someone is dangerous if you yourself are 
financially challenged. If you do finally decide to hire someone, you’ll be 
much better prepared by educating yourself, and you’ll be more focused in 
your questions and better able to assess that person’s competence.
Conventions Used in This Book
I use the following conventions in this book to help you maneuver 
through topics:
 
 I italicize all new words and terms that are defined.
 
 I boldface keywords or the main parts of bulleted items.
 
 I use monofont for all Web addresses.
Foolish Assumptions
Every book is written with a certain reader in mind, and this book is 
no different:

3
 Introduction
 
 You may have some investments, but you’re looking to develop a 
full-scale investment plan.
 
 You’d like to strengthen your portfolio.
 
 You want to evaluate your investment advisor’s advice.
 
 You have a company-sponsored investment plan, like a 401(k), and 
you’re looking to make some decisions or roll it over into a new plan.
If one or more of these descriptions sound familiar, you’ve come to the 
right place.
How This Book Is Organized
This book helps you fill gaps in your investment knowledge. It’s structured so 
that you can read it cover to cover or simply dive in to particular sections 
that most interest you. Here are the major parts.
Part I: Investing Fundamentals
Before you can confidently and intelligently choose investments, you need to 
be able to cut through the lingo and jargon to get to the heart of what invest-
ments are and are not, and how they differ from one another. In this part, I 
explain what rate of return you can reasonably expect to earn and how much 
risk you need to take to get it. This part also details how investments best fit 
your specific financial goals and situation.
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street
I know that you probably don’t want to trade in your day job for one where 
you’d wear a three-piece suit and need to know on which page of the daily 
Wall Street Journal you can find yield curves. But you do need to understand 
what the financial markets are and how you can participate in them without 
suffering too many bumps and bruises. In this part, I explain what stocks and 
bonds are all about and how to best buy them and build your future fortune.
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate
We all need places to live, work, and shop, so it makes sense that real estate 
can be a profitable part of your investment portfolio. Intelligently buying 
and managing real estate is harder than it looks, which is why this part 

4
Investing For Dummies, 5th Edition 
covers lots of territory. I show you the best ways to invest in real estate and 
provide a crash course in mortgages, landlording, buying low, selling high, 
taxes, and more.
Part IV: Savoring Small Business
There’s nothing small about the potential profits you can make from small 
business. You can choose the small-business investment option that matches 
your skills and time. If you aspire to be the best boss you’ve ever had, here 
you can find the right ways to start your own business or buy someone else’s 
small business. Or maybe you’d like to try your hand at spotting up-and-comers 
but don’t want to be on the front lines — try investing in someone else’s 
small business.
Part V: Investing Resources
Flip through your cable television channels, crack open a magazine or 
newspaper, or go Web-site surfing, and you quickly discover that you can’t 
escape investment advice. Surprisingly, each new guru you stumble upon 
contradicts the one who came before. Before you know it, although you’ve 
spent an avalanche of your valuable free time on all this investment stuff, 
you’re no closer to making an informed decision. In fact, if you’re like most 
people, you find yourself even more confused and paralyzed. Fear not! In this 
important part, I explain why many experts really aren’t experts and why 
most of them try to make the world of investing so mysterious. I highlight the 
best resources to use and experts worth listening to.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
These shorter chapters build your investment knowledge further. You find 
advice about topics such as overcoming common psychological investment 
obstacles, tips for investing in a down market, and points to ponder when 
you sell an investment.
If you’re the kind of reader who jumps around from topic to topic instead of 
reading from cover to cover, you’ll be pleased that this book has a helpful 
index and that it highlights the pages where investing terms are defined.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, icons help guide you through the maze of suggestions, 
solutions, and cautions. I hope you find that the following images make your 
journey through investment strategies smoother.

5
 Introduction
 
In the shark-infested investing waters, you’ll find creatures that feast on 
novice waders, ready to take a bite out of a swimmer’s savings. This icon 
notes when and where the sharks may be circling.
 
If you see this icon, I’m pointing out companies, products, services, and 
resources that have proved to be exceptional over the years — in other 
words, resources that I would or do use personally or would recommend to 
my friends and family.
 
I use this icon to highlight an issue that requires more detective work on your 
part. Don’t worry, though; I prepare you for your work so you don’t have to 
start out as a novice gumshoe.
 
I think the name says it all, but this icon indicates something really, really 
important — don’t you forget it!
 
Skip it or read it; the choice is yours. You’ll fill your head with more stuff that 
may prove valuable as you expand your investing know-how, but you risk 
overdosing on stuff that you may not need right away.
 
This icon denotes strategies that can enable you to build wealth faster and 
leap over tall obstacles in a single bound.
 
This icon indicates treacherous territory that has made mincemeat out of 
lesser mortals who have come before you. Skip this point at your own peril.
Where to Go from Here
If you have the time and desire, I encourage you to read this book in its 
entirety. It provides you with a detailed picture of how to maximize your 
returns while minimizing your risks through wealth-building investments. 
But you don’t have to read this book cover to cover. If you have a specific 
question or two that you want to focus on today, or you want to find some 
additional information tomorrow, it’s not a problem. Investing For Dummies, 
5th Edition, makes it easy to find answers to specific questions. Just turn to 
the Table of Contents or the index to locate the information you need. You 
can get in and get out, just like that.

In this part . . .
L
ike a good map or aerial photograph, this part helps 
you see the big picture of the investment world. Here, 
I explain the different types of investments, which ones 
are good and bad for a variety of circumstances, what 
returns you can expect, and how to make wise investing 
decisions that fit with your overall financial situation.

Exploring Your Investment Choices
In This Chapter
 Defining investing

 Understanding the role of lending and other investments
 Knowing where not to put your money
I
n many parts of the world, life’s basic necessities — food, clothing, 
shelter, and taxes — gobble the entirety of people’s meager earnings. 
Although some Americans do struggle for basic necessities, the bigger 
problem for most Americans is that they consider just about everything — 
eating out, driving new cars, hopping on an airplane for vacation — to be a 
necessity. I’ve taken it upon myself (using this book as my tool) to help you 
recognize that investing — that is, putting your money to work for you — 
is also a necessity. If you want to accomplish important personal and finan-
cial goals, such as owning a home, starting your own business, helping your 
kids through college (and spending more time with them when they’re 
young), retiring comfortably, and so on, you must know how to invest well.
It has been said, and too often quoted, that the only certainties in life are 
death and taxes. To these two certainties I add one more: being confused by 
and ignorant about investing. Because investing is a confounding activity, 
you may be tempted to look with envious eyes at those people in the world 
who appear to be savvy with money and investing. Remember that all of 
us start with the same level of financial knowledge — none! No one is born 
knowing this stuff! The only difference between those who know and those 
who don’t is that those who know have invested their time and energy 
acquiring knowledge about the investment world.
Getting Started with Investing
Before I discuss the major investing alternatives in the rest of this chapter, 
I want to start with something that’s quite basic, yet important. What exactly 
do I mean when I say “investing”? Simply stated, investing means you have 
money put away for future use.

10
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
There are thousands of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other investments. 
Unfortunately for the novice, and even for experts who are honest with you, 
knowing the name of the investment is just the tip of the iceberg. Underneath 
each of these investments lurks a veritable mountain of details.
 
If you wanted to and had the ability, you could make a full-time endeavor out 
of analyzing economic trends and financial statements and talking to business 
employees, customers, suppliers, and so on. However, I don’t want to scare 
you away from investing just because some people do it on a full-time basis. 
Making wise investments need not take a lot of your time. If you know where 
to get high-quality information, and you purchase well-managed investments, 
you can leave the investment management to the best experts. Then you can 
do the work that you’re best at and have more free time for fun stuff.
An important part of making wise investments is knowing when you have 
enough information to do things well on your own versus when you should 
hire others to help you. For example, investing in foreign stock markets is 
generally more difficult to research and understand compared with domestic 
markets. Thus, hiring a good money manager, such as through a mutual 
fund, makes more sense when investing overseas than going to all the time, 
trouble, and expense of trying to pick your own individual stocks.
I’m here to give you the information you need to make your way through 
the complex investment world. In the rest of this chapter, I clear a path so 
that you can identify the major investments and understand what each is 
good for.
Building Wealth with Ownership 
Investments
 
If you want your money to grow, and you don’t mind a bit of a roller-coaster 
ride from time to time in your investment’s values, ownership investments 
are for you. Ownership investments are those where you own a piece of some 
company or other asset (such as stock, real estate, or a small business) that 
has the ability to generate revenue and, potentially, profits.
If you want to build wealth, observing how the world’s richest have built 
their wealth is enlightening. Not surprisingly, the champions of wealth 
around the globe gained their fortunes largely through owning a piece (or all) 
of a successful company that they (or others) have built. Take the case of 
Steve Jobs, co-founder and chief executive officer of Apple Inc. Apple makes 
computers, portable digital music players (such as the iPod and all its varia-
tions), and mobile communication devices (specifically, the iPhone), and 
software, among other products.

11
 Chapter 1: Exploring Your Investment Choices
Every time I, or millions of other people, buy an Apple computer or iPod, 
iPhone, and so on, Apple makes more money. As an owner of more than 5 
million shares of stock, each of which is valued at about $140 per share, Jobs 
makes more money as increasing sales and profits drive up the stock’s price, 
which was less than $10 per share as recently as 2004.
In addition to owning their own businesses, many well-to-do people have 
built their nest eggs by investing in real estate and the stock market. With 
softening housing prices in many regions in recent years, some folks newer to 
the real estate world incorrectly believe that real estate is a loser, not a long-
term winner. Likewise, the stock market goes through down periods but does 
well over the long-term. (See Chapter 2 for the straight scoop on investment 
risks and returns.)
And of course, some people come into wealth the old-fashioned way — they 
inherit it. Even if your parents are among the rare wealthy ones and you 
expect them to pass on big bucks to you, you need to know how to invest 
money intelligently.
 
If you understand and are comfortable with the risks and take sensible steps 
to diversify (don’t put all your eggs in the same basket), ownership invest-
ments are the key to building wealth. To accomplish typical longer-term 
financial goals, such as retiring, the money that you save and invest needs to 
grow at a healthy clip. If you dump all your money in bank accounts that pay 
little if any interest, you’re likely to fall short of your goals.
Not everyone needs to make his money grow, of course. Suppose that you 
inherit a significant sum and/or maintain a restrained standard of living and 
work your whole life simply because you enjoy doing so. In this situation, you 
may not need to take the risks involved with a potentially faster-growth 
investment. You may be more comfortable with safer investments, such as 
paying off your mortgage faster than necessary. Chapter 3 helps you think 
through such issues.
The stock market
Stocks are an example of an ownership investment because they represent 
shares of ownership in a company.
If you want to share in the growth and profits of companies like Apple, you 
can! You simply buy shares of their stock through a brokerage firm. However, 
just because Apple makes money in the future, there’s no guarantee that the 
value of its stock will increase.
Some companies today sell their stock directly to investors, allowing you to 
bypass brokers. You can also invest in stocks via a stock mutual fund, where 
a fund manager decides which individual stocks to include in the fund. 
(I discuss the various methods for buying stock in Chapter 6.)

12
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
 
You don’t need a BA, MBA, MD, or PhD to make money in the stock market. If 
you can practice some simple lessons, such as making regular and systematic 
investments and investing in proven companies and funds while minimizing 
your investment expenses and taxes, you’ll be a winner.
However, I don’t believe that you can “beat the markets,” and you certainly 
can’t beat the best professional money managers at their own, full-time 
game. This book shows you time-proven, nongimmicky methods to make 
your money grow in the stock market as well as in other financial markets. 
(I explain how in Part II.)
Real estate
Another method that people of varying economic means use to build wealth 
is to invest in real estate. Owning and managing real estate is like running a 
small business. You need to satisfy customers (tenants), manage your costs, 
keep an eye on the competition, and so on. Some methods of real estate 
investing require more time than others, but many are proven ways to 
build wealth.
John, who works for a city government, and his wife, Linda, a computer 
analyst, have built several million dollars in investment real estate equity 
(the difference between the property’s market value and debts owed) over 
the past three decades. “Our parents owned rental property, and we could 
see what it could do for you by providing income and building wealth,” says 
John. Investing in real estate also appealed to John and Linda because they 
didn’t know anything about the stock market, so they wanted to stay away 
from it. The idea of leverage — making money with borrowed money — on 
real estate also appealed to them.
John and Linda bought their first property, a duplex, when their combined 
income was $20,000 per year. Every time they moved to a new home, they 
kept the prior one and converted it to a rental. Now in their 50s, John and 
Linda own seven pieces of investment real estate and are multimillionaires. 
“It’s like a second retirement, having thousands in monthly income from the 
real estate,” says John.
John readily admits that rental real estate has its hassles. “We haven’t 
enjoyed getting calls in the middle of the night, but now we have a property 
manager who can help with this when we’re not available. It’s also sometimes 
a pain finding new tenants,” he says.
Overall, John and Linda figure that they’ve been well rewarded for the time 
they spent and the money they invested. The income from John and Linda’s 
rental properties allows them to live in a nicer home.

13
 Chapter 1: Exploring Your Investment Choices
 
Ultimately, to make your money grow much faster than inflation and taxes, 
you must absolutely, positively do at least one thing — take some risk. Any 
investment that has real growth potential also has shrinkage potential! You 
may not want to take the risk or have the stomach for it. Don’t despair: I 
discuss lower-risk investments in this book as well. You can find out about 
risks and returns in Chapter 2.
Small business
I know people who have hit investing home runs by owning or buying a 
business. Unlike the part-time nature of investing in the stock market, most 
people work at running their business full time, increasing their chances of 
doing something big financially with it. If you try to invest in individual 
stocks, by contrast, you’re likely to work at it part time, competing against 
professionals who invest practically around the clock. Even if you devote 
almost all of your time to managing your stock portfolio, you’re still a passive 
bystander in a business run by someone else. When you invest in your own 
small business, you’re the boss, for better or worse.
A decade ago, Calvin set out to develop a corporate publishing firm. Because 
he took the risk of starting his business and has been successful in slowly 
building it, today, in his 50s, he enjoys a net worth in excess of $10 million 
and can retire if he wants. Even more important to many business owners — 
and the reason that financially successful entrepreneurs such as Calvin don’t 
call it quits after they’ve amassed a lot of cash — are the nonfinancial 
rewards of investing, including the challenge and fulfillment of operating a 
successful business.
Who wants to invest like a millionaire?
Having a million dollars isn’t nearly as rare as it 
used to be. In fact, according to the Spectrem 
Group, a firm that conducts research on wealth, 
there are now 9 million U.S. households that 
have at least $1 million in wealth (excluding the 
value of their primary home). There are more 
than 1 million households with $5 million or 
more in wealth.
Interestingly, households with wealth of at least 
$1 million rarely let financial advisors direct 
their investments. Only one of ten such house-
holds allows advisors to call the shots and make 
the moves, whereas 30 percent don’t use any 
advisors. The remaining 60 percent consult an 
advisor on an as-needed basis and then make 
their own moves.
As in past surveys, recent wealth surveys show 
that affluent investors achieved and built upon 
their wealth with ownership investments, such 
as their own small businesses, real estate, and 
stocks.

Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Sandra has worked on her own as an interior designer for more than two 
decades. She previously worked in fashion as a model, and then as a retail 
store manager. Her first taste of interior design was redesigning rooms at 
a condominium project. “I knew when I did that first building and turned it 
into something wonderful and profitable that I loved doing this kind of 
work,” says Sandra. Today, Sandra’s firm specializes in the restoration of 
landmark hotels, and her work has been written up in numerous magazines. 
“The money is not of primary importance to me . . . my work is driven by 
a passion . . . but obviously it has to be profitable,” she says. Sandra has also 
experienced the fun and enjoyment of designing hotels in many parts of the 
United States and overseas, including one in Japan.
Most small-business owners (myself included) quickly point out that the 
entrepreneurial life is not a walk through the rose garden (although it does 
have its share of thorns). Emotionally and financially, entrepreneurship is 
sometimes a roller coaster. In addition to the financial rewards, however, 
small-business owners can enjoy seeing the impact of their work and knowing 
that it makes a difference. Combined, Calvin and Sandra’s firms created 
dozens of new jobs.
Not everyone needs to be sparked by the desire to start her own company 
to profit from small business. You can share in the economic rewards of the 
entrepreneurial world through buying an existing business or investing in 
someone else’s budding enterprise. I talk more about evaluating and buying 
a business in Part IV of this book (and in the latest edition of Small Business 
For Dummies, written by Jim Schell and me; published by Wiley).
Generating Income from 
Lending Investments
The other major types of investment include those in which you lend your 
money. Suppose that, like most people, you keep some money in your local 
bank — most likely in a checking account, but perhaps also in a savings 
account or certificate of deposit (CD). No matter what type of bank account 
you place your money in, you’re lending your money to the bank.
 
How long and under what conditions you lend money to your bank depend on 
the specific bank and account that you use. With a CD, you commit to lend 
your money to the bank for a specific length of time — perhaps six months or 
even a year. In return, the bank probably pays you a higher rate of interest 
than if you put your money in a bank account offering you immediate access 
to the money. (You may demand termination of the CD early; however, you’ll 
be penalized.)

15
 Chapter 1: Exploring Your Investment Choices
As I discuss in more detail in Chapter 7, you can also invest your money in 
bonds — another type of lending investment. When you purchase a bond 
that has been issued by the government or a company, you agree to lend 
your money for a predetermined period of time and receive a particular rate 
of interest. A bond may pay you 6 percent interest over the next five years, 
for example.
An investor’s return from lending investments is typically limited to the 
original investment plus interest payments. If you lend your money to Apple 
through one of its bonds that matures, say, in ten years, and Apple triples 
in size over the next decade, you won’t share in its growth. Apple’s stock-
holders and employees reap the rewards of the company’s success, but as 
a bondholder, you don’t (you simply get interest and the face value of the 
bond back at maturity).
 
Many people keep too much of their money in lending investments, thus 
allowing others to reap the rewards of economic growth. Although lending 
investments appear safer because you know in advance what return you’ll 
receive, they aren’t that safe. The long-term risk of these seemingly safe 
money investments is that your money will grow too slowly to enable you to 
accomplish your personal financial goals. In the worst cases, the company 
or other institution to which you’re lending money can go under and stiff you 
for your loan.
Considering Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are any investments that you can quickly convert to cash 
without cost to you. With most checking accounts, for example, you can 
write a check or withdraw cash by visiting a teller — either the live or the 
automated type.
Money market mutual funds are another type of cash equivalent. Investors, 
both large and small, invest hundreds of billions of dollars in money market 
mutual funds because the best money market funds produce higher yields 
than bank savings accounts. The yield advantage of a money market fund 
almost always widens when interest rates increase because banks move 
about as fast as molasses on a cold winter day to raise savings account rates.
Why shouldn’t you take advantage of an extra 1 or 2 percent yield? Many 
bank savers sacrifice this yield because they think that money market funds 
are risky — but they’re not. Money market mutual funds generally invest 
in ultrasafe things such as short-term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. 
government-issued Treasury bills, and commercial paper (short-term bonds) 
that the most creditworthy corporations issue.

16
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Another reason people keep too much money in traditional bank accounts 
is that the local bank branch office makes the cash seem more accessible. 
Money market mutual funds, however, offer many quick ways to get your 
cash. You can write a check (most funds stipulate the check must be for at 
least $250) or call the fund and request that it mail or electronically transfer 
you money.
 
Move extra money that’s dozing away in your bank savings account into a 
higher-yielding money market mutual fund! Even if you have just a few 
thousand dollars, the extra yield more than pays for the cost of this book. 
If you’re in a high tax bracket, you can also use tax-free money market funds. 
(See Chapter 8 to find out more about money market funds.)
Steering Clear of Futures and Options
Suppose you think that IBM’s stock is a good investment. The direction that 
the management team is taking impresses you, and you like the products and 
The double whammy of inflation and taxes
Bank accounts and bonds that pay a decent 
return are reassuring to many investors. Earning 
a small amount of interest sure beats losing 
some or all your money in a risky investment.
The problem is that money in a savings account, 
for example, that pays 3 percent isn’t actually 
yielding you 3 percent. It’s not that the bank is 
lying — it’s just that your investment bucket 
contains some not-so-obvious holes.
The first hole is taxes. When you earn interest, 
you must pay taxes on it (unless you invest the 
money in a retirement account, in which case 
you generally pay the taxes at a later date, 
when you withdraw the money). If you’re a 
moderate-income earner, you end up losing 
about a third of your interest to taxes. Your 3 
percent return is now down to 2 percent.
But the second hole in your investment bucket 
can be even bigger than taxes: inflation. 
Although a few products become cheaper over 
time (computers, for example), most goods and 
services increase in price. Inflation in the United 
States is running right around 3 percent per 
year. Inflation depresses the purchasing power 
of your investment’s returns. If you subtract the 
3 percent “cost” of inflation from the remaining 
2 percent after payment of taxes, I’m sorry to 
say that you lost 1 percent on your investment.
To recap: For every dollar you invested in the 
bank a year ago, despite the fact that the bank 
paid you your 3 pennies of interest, you’re left 
with only 99 cents in real purchasing power for 
every dollar you had a year ago. In other words, 
thanks to the inflation and tax holes in your 
investment bucket, you can buy less with your 
money now versus what you could have a year 
ago, even though you’ve invested your money 
for a year.

 Chapter 1: Exploring Your Investment Choices
services that the company offers. Profits seem to be on a positive trend; 
everything’s looking up.
You can go out and buy the stock — suppose that it’s currently trading at 
around $100 per share. If the price rises to $150 in the next six months, 
you’ve made yourself a 50 percent profit ($150 – $100 = $50) on your original 
$100 investment. (Of course, you have to pay some brokerage fees to buy and 
then sell the stock.)
But instead of buying the stock outright, you can buy what are known as call 
options on IBM. A call option gives you the right to buy shares of IBM under 
specified terms from the person who sells you the call option. You may be 
able to purchase a call option that allows you to exercise your right to buy 
IBM stock at, say, $120 per share in the next six months. For this privilege, 
you may pay $2 per share.
If IBM’s stock price skyrockets to, say, $150 in the next few months, the value 
of your options that allow you to buy the stock at $120 will be worth a lot — 
at least $30. You can then simply sell your options, which you bought for $2 
in this example, at a huge profit — you’ve multiplied your money 15-fold!
 
Although this talk of fat profits sounds much more exciting than simply buying 
the stock directly and making far less money from a stock price increase, 
options have two big problems:
 
 If IBM’s stock price goes nowhere or rises only a little during the six-
month period when you hold the call option, the option expires as 
worthless, and you lose all — that is, 100 percent — of your investment. 
In fact, in my example, if IBM’s stock trades at $120 or less at the time 
the option expires, the option is worthless.
 
 A call option represents a short-term gamble (in this example, over the 
next six months) on IBM’s stock price — not an investment in IBM. IBM 
could expand its business and profits greatly in the years and decades 
ahead, but the value of the call option hinges on the ups and downs of 
IBM’s stock price over a relatively short period of time. If the stock 
market happens to dip in the next six months, IBM may get pulled down 
as well, despite the company’s improving financial health.
Futures are similar to options in that both can be used as gambling instru-
ments. Futures deal mainly with the value of commodities such as heating oil, 
corn, wheat, gold, silver, and pork bellies. Futures have a delivery date that’s 
in the not-too-distant future. (Do you really want bushels of wheat delivered 
to your home? Or worse yet, pork bellies?) You can place a small down pay-
ment — around 10 percent — toward the purchase of futures, thereby greatly 
leveraging your “investment.” If prices fall, you need to put up more money 
to keep from having your position sold.

18
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
My advice: Don’t gamble with futures and options.
 
The only real use that you may (if ever) have for these derivatives (so called 
because their value is “derived” from the price of other securities) is to hedge. 
Suppose that you hold a lot of a stock that has greatly appreciated, and you 
don’t want to sell now because of the tax bite. Perhaps you want to postpone 
selling the stock until next year because you plan on not working, or you can 
then benefit from the lower, long-term capital gains tax rate. You can buy 
what’s called a put option, which increases in value when a stock’s price falls 
(because the put option grants you the right to sell your stock to the pur-
chaser of the put option at a preset stock price). Thus, if the stock price does 
fall, the rising put option value offsets some of your losses on the stock you 
still hold. Using put options allows you to postpone selling your stock without 
exposing yourself to the risk of a falling stock price.
Passing Up Precious Metals
Over the millennia, gold and silver have served as mediums of exchange or 
currency because they have intrinsic value and can’t be debased the way 
that paper currencies can (by printing more money). These precious metals 
are used in jewelry and manufacturing.
Get rich with oil and gold?
During the global economic expansion of the 
2000s, oil and other commodities increased sig-
nificantly in value. The surge in oil prices cer-
tainly garnered plenty of headlines when it 
surged past $100 per barrel. So too did the price 
of gold as it surged past $1,000 in 2008, setting a 
new all-time high. These prices represented 
tremendous increases over the past decade 
with the price of oil having increased more than 
600 percent (from less than $20 per barrel) and 
gold more than tripling in value (from less than 
$300 per ounce).
However, despite these seemingly major moves, 
when considering the increases in the cost of 
living, at $100-plus per barrel, oil prices were 
just reaching the levels attained in late 1979! 
And when gold hit a new high in early 2008, it 
was still far, far from the inflation-adjusted 
levels it reached nearly three decades earlier. 
To reach those levels, gold would have to more 
than double from its current high levels to more 
than $2,000 an ounce!
So although the price increases in gold and oil 
(as well as some other commodities) were dra-
matic during the past decade, over the past 30 
years, oil and gold increased in value less than 
overall low rate of U.S. inflation. So, one would 
hardly have gotten rich investing in oil and gold 
over the long-term — rather it has been more 
like treading water.

19
 Chapter 1: Exploring Your Investment Choices
As investments, gold and silver perform well during bouts of inflation. For 
example, from 1972 to 1980, when inflation zoomed into the double-digit 
range in the United States and stocks and bonds went into the tank, gold and 
silver prices skyrocketed more than 500 percent. With precious metals pric-
ing zooming skyward again in the 2000s, some have feared the return of infla-
tion, but the recently surging prices seem to be driven by the global 
economic boom, not inflation.
 
Over the long term, precious metals are lousy investments. They don’t pay 
any dividends, and their price increases at best may just keep up with, but 
not ahead of, increases in the cost of living. Although investing in precious 
metals is better than keeping cash in a piggy bank or stuffing it in a mattress, 
the investment returns aren’t nearly as good as bonds, stocks, and real 
estate. One way to earn better long-term returns than what investing in simple 
precious metals provides is to invest in a mutual fund of stocks of gold and 
precious metals companies (see Chapter 8 for more information).
Counting Out Collectibles
The term collectibles is a catchall category for antiques, art, autographs, 
baseball cards, clocks, coins, comic books, diamonds, dolls, gems, photo-
graphs, rare books, rugs, stamps, vintage wine, writing utensils, and a whole 
host of other items. Although connoisseurs of fine art, antiques, and vintage 
wine wouldn’t like the comparison of their pastime with buying old playing 
cards or chamber pots, the bottom line is that collectibles are all objects 
with little intrinsic value. Wine is just a bunch of old mushed-up grapes. A 
painting is simply a canvas and some paint that at retail would set you back a 
few bucks. Stamps are small pieces of paper, less than an inch square. 
Baseball cards — heck, my childhood friends and I used to stick these 
between our bike spokes!
I’m not trying to diminish contributions that artists and others make to our 
culture. And I know that some people place a high value on some of these 
collectibles. But true investments that can make your money grow, such as 
stocks, real estate, or a small business, are assets that can produce income 
and profits. Collectibles have little intrinsic value and are thus subject to the 
whims and speculations of buyers and sellers.
 
Here are some other major problems with collectibles:
 
 Markups are huge. The spread between the price that a dealer pays for 
an object and then sells the same exact object for is often around 100 
percent. Sometimes the difference is even greater, particularly if a dealer 
is the second or third middleman in the chain of purchase. So at a mini-
mum, your purchase must typically double in value just to get you back 
to even. And that may take 10 to 20 years or more!

20
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
 
 Lots of other costs add up. If the markups aren’t bad enough, with some 
collectibles you incur all sorts of other costs. If you buy more-expensive 
pieces, you may need to have them appraised. You may have to pay 
storage and insurance costs as well. And unlike the markup, you pay 
some of these fees year after year after year of ownership.
 
 You can get stuck with a pig in a poke. Sometimes, you may overpay 
even more for a collectible because you don’t realize some imperfection 
or inferiority of an item. Worse, you may buy a forgery. Even reputable 
dealers have been duped by forgeries.
 
 Your pride and joy can deteriorate over time. Damage from sunlight, 
humidity, temperatures that are too high or too low, and a whole host of 
vagaries can ruin the quality of your collectible. Insurance doesn’t cover 
this type of damage or negligence on your part.
 
 The returns stink. Even if you ignore the substantial costs of buying, 
holding, and selling, the average returns that investors earn from 
collectibles rarely keep ahead of inflation and are generally inferior 
to stock market, real estate, and small-business investing. Objective 
collectible return data are hard to come by. Never, ever trust “data” 
that dealers or the many collectible trade publications provide.
The best returns that collectible investors reap come from the ability to iden-
tify, years in advance, items that will become popular. Do you think you can 
do that? You may be the smartest person in the world, but you should know 
that most dealers can’t tell what’s going to rocket to popularity in the coming 
decades. Dealers make their profits the same way as other retailers, from 
the spread or markup on the merchandise that they sell. The public and 
collectors have fickle, quirky tastes that no one can predict. Did you know 
that Beanie Babies, Furbies, Pet Rocks, or Cabbage Patch Kids were going 
to be such hits?
You can find out enough about a specific type of collectible to become a 
better investor than the average person, but you’re going to have to be 
among the best — perhaps the top 10 percent of such collectors — to have 
a shot at earning decent returns. To get to this level of expertise, you need 
to invest hundreds if not thousands of hours reading, researching, and 
educating yourself about your specific type of collectible.
Nothing is wrong with spending money on collectibles, but I don’t want you to 
fool yourself into thinking that they’re investments. You can sink lots of your 
money into these non-income-producing, poor-return “investments.” At their 
best as investments, collectibles give the wealthy a way to buy quality stuff 
that doesn’t depreciate.
 
If you must buy collectibles, here are some tips to keep in mind:

21
 Chapter 1: Exploring Your Investment Choices
 
 Collect for your love of the collectible, your desire to enjoy it, or your 
interest in finding out about or mastering a subject, not because you 
expect high investment returns, because you probably won’t get them.
 
 Keep quality items that you and your family have purchased and hope 
that someday they’re worth something. Keeping these quality items is 
the simplest way to break into the collectible business. The complete 
sets of baseball cards I gathered as a youngster are now (30-plus years 
later) worth hundreds of dollars to, in one case, $1,000!
 
 Buy from the source and cut out the middlemen whenever possible. In 
some cases, you may be able to buy from the artist. (My brother pur-
chases most of his pottery directly from artists.)
 
 Check collectibles that are comparable to the one you have your eye on, 
shop around, and don’t be afraid to negotiate. An effective way to negoti-
ate, after you decide what you like, is to make your offer to the dealer or 
artist by phone. Because the seller isn’t standing right next to you, you 
don’t feel pressure to decide immediately.
 
 Ask the dealer who thinks that the item is such a great investment for a 
written guarantee to buy back the item from you, if you opt to sell, for at 
least the same price you paid or higher within five years.
 
 Use a comprehensive resource to research, buy, sell, maintain, and 
improve your collectible, such as the books by Ralph and Terry Kovel or 
their Web site at www.kovels.com.

A
 woman passes up eating a hamburger at a picnic because she heard 
that she could contract a deadly E. coli infection from eating improp-
erly cooked meat. The next week, that same woman hops in the passenger 
seat of her friend’s car without buckling her seat belt.
A young child is about to go for a bike ride when her parents notice that she 
left her bike helmet in the garage. The parents call the child back to put on 
her helmet. The next day, that same girl goes to a friend’s house to play with 
a boy who finds his parents’ loaded gun, even though his older brother is 
at home.
I’m not trying to depress or frighten anyone. However, I am trying to make an 
important point about risk — something that we all deal with on a daily basis. 
Risk is in the eye of the beholder. Many of us base our perception of risk, in 
large part, on our experiences and what we’ve been exposed to. Many people 
fret about relatively small risks while overlooking much larger risks.
Sure, a risk of an E. coli infection from eating poorly cooked meat exists, so 
the woman who was leery of eating the hamburger at the picnic had a legiti-
mate concern. However, that same woman got into the friend’s car without 
an airbag and placed herself at far greater risk of dying in that situation than 
if she had eaten the hamburger. Annually in the United States, more than 
40,000 people die in automobile accidents.
Likewise, although the parents had a right to be concerned about their 
young daughter suffering a head injury should she fall off her bike, they 
completely overlooked the significant risk of an improperly stored gun in 

24
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
other households. According to research conducted by the nonprofit Center 
to Prevent Handgun Violence, an astounding 43 percent of U.S. households 
with children contain a firearm, and 28 percent of these gun-owning parents 
do not keep the gun locked or otherwise secured.
Evaluating Risks
Everywhere you turn, risks exist; some are just more apparent than others. 
Many people misunderstand risks. With increased knowledge, you may 
be able to reduce or conquer some of your fears and make more sensible 
decisions about reducing risks. For example, some people who fear flying 
don’t understand that statistically, flying is much safer than driving a car. 
You’re approximately 40 times more likely to die in a motor vehicle than in 
an airplane. But when a plane goes down, it’s big news because dozens and 
sometimes hundreds of people, who weren’t engaging in reckless behavior, 
perish. Meanwhile, the media seem to pay less attention to the 100-plus 
people, on average, who die on the road every day.
This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t drive or fly, or that you shouldn’t drive 
to the airport. However, you may consider steps you can take to reduce the 
significant risks you expose yourself to in a car. For example, you can get a 
car with more safety features, or you may bypass riding with reckless taxi 
drivers whose cars lack seat belts.
Although some of us like to live life to its fullest and take “fun” risks (how 
else can you explain triathletes, mountain climbers, parachutists, and bungee 
jumpers?), most people seek to minimize risk and maximize enjoyment in 
their lives. But most people also understand that they’d be a lot less happy 
living a life that sought to eliminate all risks, and they likely wouldn’t be able 
to anyway.
 
Likewise, if you attempt to avoid all the risks that investing involves, you 
won’t succeed, and you likely won’t be happy with your investment results 
and lifestyle. In the investment world, some people don’t go near stocks or 
any investment that they perceive to be volatile. As a result, such investors 
often end up with lousy long-term returns, and they expose themselves to 
some high risks that they overlooked, such as the risk of inflation and taxes 
eroding the purchasing power of their money.
You can’t live without taking risks. Risk-free activities or ways of living 
don’t exist. You can minimize, but never eliminate, risks. Some methods 
of risk reduction aren’t palatable because they reduce your quality of life. 
Risks are also composed of several factors. In the sections that follow, I 
discuss the various types of investment risks and methods that you can 
use to sensibly reduce these risks while not missing out on the upside that 
growth investments offer.

25
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Market-value risk
Although the stock market can help you build wealth, most people recognize 
that it can also drop substantially — by 10, 20, 30 percent, or more in a 
relatively short period of time. After peaking in 2000, U.S. stocks, as mea-
sured by the large-company S&P 500 index, dropped about 50 percent by 
2002. Stocks on the NASDAQ, which is heavily weighted toward technology 
stocks, plunged more than 76 percent from 2000 through 2002!
In a mere six weeks (from mid-July 1998 to early September 1998), large-
company U.S. stocks fell about 20 percent. (An index of smaller-company U.S. 
stocks dropped 33 percent over a slightly longer period of two and a half 
months.) In three months from October 2007 to January 2008, U.S. stocks 
dropped 19 percent, while small company stocks shed nearly 24 percent.
If you think that the U.S. stock market crash that occurred in the fall of 1987 
was a big one (the market plunged 36 percent in a matter of weeks), take a 
look at Table 2-1, which lists major declines over the past 100-plus years that 
were all worse than the 1987 crash.

Real estate exhibits similar unruly, annoying tendencies. Although real estate 
(like stocks) has been a terrific long-term investment, various real estate 
markets get clobbered from time to time.

26
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
U.S. housing prices took a 25 percent tumble from the late 1920s to the mid-
1930s. When the oil industry collapsed in the southern United States in the 
early 1980s, real estate prices took a beating in that area. Later in the 1980s 
and early 1990s, the northeastern United States became mired in a severe 
recession, and real estate prices fell by 20-plus percent in many areas. After 
peaking near 1990, many of the West Coast housing markets, especially those 
in California, experienced falling prices — dropping 20 percent or more in 
most areas by the mid-1990s. The Japanese real estate market crash also 
began around the time of the California market fall. Property prices in Japan 
collapsed more than 60 percent.
Declining U.S. housing prices in the mid- to late 2000s garnered unprece-
dented attention. Some folks and pundits acted like this was the worst 
housing market ever. To date, it seems comparable to the decline of the 
early 1990s. Foreclosures increased in part due to buyers financing their 
home’s purchase with risky mortgages (which I recommend against in my 
books, including this one — see Chapter 12). I must note here that housing 
market conditions vary by area. For example, some portions of the Pacific 
Northwest and South actually appreciated during the mid- to late 2000s, 
while other markets experienced declines.
After reading this section, you may want to keep all your money in the 
bank — after all, you know you won’t lose your money, and you won’t have 
to be a nonstop worrier. No one has ever lost 20, 40, 60, or 80 percent of his 
bank-held savings vehicle in a few years! But just letting your money sit 
around would be a mistake.
 
If you pass up the stock and real estate markets simply because of the poten-
tial market value risk, you miss out on a historic, time-tested method of build-
ing substantial wealth. Instead of seeing declines and market corrections as a 
horrible thing, view them as the markets having a sale. If you’re considering 
buying stocks or real estate, a decline in prices presents opportunities, but 
human emotions often scare us away from buying something that seemingly 
others are shunning.
Later in this chapter, I show you the generous returns that stocks and real 
estate as well as other investments have historically provided. The following 
sections suggest some simple things you can do to lower your investing risk 
and help prevent your portfolio from suffering a huge fall.
Diversify for a gentler ride
Individual stock markets may crash. However, the various stock markets 
around the world have never all crashed at the same time. For example, 
when the U.S. stock market crashed in the fall of 1987, some foreign stock 

27
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
markets dropped far less or not at all. So if you had spread your money 
across the many different stock markets, your portfolio wouldn’t have 
suffered nearly as much as it would have if you held all your stocks in 
the U.S. market.
 
You can invest overseas to reduce your investment risk if you worry about the 
health of the U.S. economy, the government, and the dollar. Most large U.S. 
companies do business overseas, so when you invest in larger U.S. company 
stocks, you get some international investment exposure. You can also invest 
in international company stocks, ideally via mutual funds (which I discuss in 
Chapter 8).
Of course, investing overseas can’t totally protect you. You can’t do much 
about a global economic catastrophe. If you worry about the risk of such a 
calamity, you should probably also worry about a huge meteor crashing into 
Earth. Maybe there’s a way to colonize outer space. . . .
 
Diversifying your investments can involve more than just your stock portfolio, 
however. You can also hold some real estate investments to diversify your 
investment portfolio. Many real estate markets actually appreciated in the 
early 2000s while the U.S. stock market was in the doghouse. Conversely, 
when U.S. real estate entered a multi-year slump in the mid-2000s, stocks 
performed well.
Consider your time horizon
Investors who worry that the stock market may take a dive and take their 
money down with it should first consider the length of time that they plan 
to invest. In a one-year period in the stock and bond markets, anything can 
happen (as shown in Figure 2-1). History shows that about once in every 
three years that you invest in the stock and bond markets, you lose money. 
However, stock market investors have made money (sometimes substantial 
amounts) approximately two-thirds of the time over a one-year period. 
(Bond investors made money about two-thirds of the time, too, although 
they made a good deal less on average.)
Although the stock market is more volatile in the short term than the bond 
market, stock market investors have earned far better long-term returns than 
bond investors have. (See the “Stock returns” section, later in this chapter.) 
Why? Because stock investors bear risks that bond investors don’t bear, and 
it’s a reasonable expectation they will be compensated for it. Remember, 
however, that bonds generally outperform a boring old bank account.
 
History has shown that the risk of a stock or bond market fall becomes less 
of a concern the longer the period that you plan to invest. As Figure 2-2 
shows, as the holding period during which you own stocks increases from 
1 year to 3 years to 5 years to 10 years, and then to 20 years, your likelihood 

28
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
of making a profit increases. In fact, over any 20-year time span, U.S. stock 
market investors have never lost money, even after you subtract for the 
effects of inflation.
Most stock market investors whom I know are concerned about the risk of 
losing money. Figure 2-2 clearly shows that the key to minimizing the proba-
bility that you’ll lose money in stocks is to hold them for the longer term. 
Don’t invest in stocks unless you plan to hold them for at least five years — 
and preferably a decade or longer. Please see Part II of this book for more on 
using stocks as a long-term investment.

Pare down holdings in bloated markets
Perhaps you’ve heard the expression “Buy low, sell high.” Although I don’t 
believe that you can time the markets (that is, predict the most profitable 
time to buy and sell), spotting a greatly overpriced market isn’t too difficult. 
For example, in the second edition of this book, published in 1999, I warned 
readers about the grossly inflated prices of many Internet and technology 
stocks (see Chapter 5). Throughout this book, I explain some simple yet 
powerful methods you can use to measure whether a particular investment 
market is of fair value, of good value, or overpriced. You should avoid 
overpriced investments for two important reasons:
 
 If and when these overpriced investments fall, they usually fall farther 
and faster than more fairly priced investments.
 
 You can always find other investments that offer higher potential 
returns.

30
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
 
Ideally, you want to avoid having a lot of your money in markets that appear 
overpriced (see Chapter 5 for how to spot pricey markets). Practically speak-
ing, avoiding overpriced markets doesn’t mean that you should try to sell all 
your holdings in such markets with the vain hope of buying them back at a 
much lower price. However, you may benefit from the following strategies:
 
 Invest new money elsewhere. Focus investment of new money some-
where other than the overpriced market; put it into investments that 
offer you better values. Thus, without selling any of your seemingly 
expensive investments, they become a smaller portion of your total hold-
ings. If you hold investments outside tax-sheltered retirement accounts, 
focusing your money elsewhere also offers the benefit of allowing you to 
avoid incurring taxes from selling appreciated investments.
 
 If you have to sell, sell the expensive stuff. If you need to raise money 
to live on, such as for retirement or for a major purchase, sell the 
big-ticket items. As long as the taxes aren’t too troublesome, it’s better 
to sell high and lock in your profits. Chapter 21 discusses issues to 
weigh when you contemplate selling an investment.
Individual-investment risk
A downdraft can put an entire investment market on a roller-coaster ride, but 
healthy markets also have their share of individual losers. For example, from 
the early 1980s through the late 1990s, the U.S. stock market had one of the 
greatest appreciating markets in history. You’d never know it, though, if you 
held one of the great losers of that period.
Consider a company now called Navistar, which has undergone enormous 
transformations in the past two decades. This company used to be called 
International Harvester and manufactured farm equipment, trucks, and 
construction and other industrial equipment. Today, Navistar makes 
mostly trucks.
In late 1983, this company’s stock traded at more than $140 per share. It then 
plunged more than 90 percent over the ensuing decade (as shown in Figure 
2-3). Even with a rally in recent years, Navistar stock still trades at under $50 
per share (after dipping below $10 per share). Lest you think that’s a big 
drop, this company’s stock traded as high as $455 per share in the late 1970s! 
If a worker retired from this company in the late 1970s with $200,000 invested 
in the company stock, the retiree’s investment would be worth about $25,000 
today! On the other hand, if the retiree had simply swapped his stock at 
retirement for a diversified portfolio of stocks, which I explain how to build 
in Part II, his $200,000 nest egg would’ve instead grown to more than 
$2,800,000!

NAVISTAR INTL (NAV)
Just as individual stock prices can plummet, so can individual real estate 
property prices. In California during the 1990s, for example, earthquakes 
rocked the prices of properties built on landfill. These quakes highlighted 
the dangers of building on poor soil. In the early 1980s, real estate values 
in the communities of Times Beach, Missouri, and Love Canal, New York, 
plunged due to carcinogenic toxic waste contamination. (Ultimately, many 
property owners in these areas were compensated for their losses by the 
federal government, as well as by some real estate agencies that didn’t 
disclose these known contaminants.)
 
Here are some simple steps you can take to lower the risk of individual invest-
ments that can upset your goals:
 
 Do your homework. When you purchase real estate, a whole host of 
inspections can save you from buying a money pit. With stocks, you 
can examine some measures of value and the company’s financial 
condition and business strategy to reduce your chances of buying into 
an overpriced company or one on the verge of major problems. Parts II, 
III, and IV of this book give you more information on researching your 
investment.
 
 Diversify. Investors who seek growth invest in securities such as stocks. 
Placing significant amounts of your capital in one or a handful of securi-
ties is risky, particularly if the stocks are in the same industry or closely 
related industries. To reduce this risk, purchase stocks in a variety of 
industries and companies within each industry. (See Part II for details.)
 
 Hire someone to invest for you. The best mutual funds (see Chapter 8) 
offer low-cost, professional management and oversight, as well as diver-
sification. Stock mutual funds typically own 25 or more securities in a 
variety of companies in different industries. The best exchange-traded 
funds offer similar benefits at low cost. In Part III, I explain how you can 
invest in real estate in a similar way (that is, by leaving the driving to 
someone else).

32
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Purchasing-power risk
Increases in the cost of living (that is, inflation) can erode the value of your 
retirement resources and what you can buy with that money — also known 
as its purchasing power. When Ethel retired at the age of 60, she was pleased 
with her retirement income. She was receiving an $800-per-month pension 
and $1,200 per month from money that she had invested in long-term bonds. 
Her monthly expenditures amounted to about $1,500, so she was able to save 
a little money for an occasional trip.
Fast-forward 15 years. Ethel still receives $800 per month from her pension, 
but now she gets only $900 per month of investment income, which comes 
from some certificates of deposit. Ethel bailed out of bonds after she lost 
sleep over the sometimes roller-coaster-like price movements in the bond 
market. Her monthly expenditures now amount to approximately $2,400, 
and she uses some of her investment principal (original investment). She’s 
terrified of outliving her money.
Ethel has reason to worry. She has 100 percent of her money invested with-
out protection against increases in the cost of living. Although her income 
felt comfortable in the beginning of her retirement, it doesn’t at age 75, and 
Ethel may easily live another 15 or more years.
Liquidity
The term liquidity refers to how long it takes and 
at what cost you can convert an investment into 
cash. The money in your wallet is considered 
perfectly liquid — it’s already cash.
Suppose that you invested money in a handful 
of stocks. Although you can’t easily sell these 
stocks on a Saturday night, you can sell most 
stocks quickly through a broker for a nominal 
fee any day that the financial markets are open 
(normal working days). You pay a higher per-
centage to sell your stocks if you use a high-
cost broker or if you have a small amount of 
stock to sell.
Real estate is generally much less liquid than 
stock. Preparing your property for sale takes 
time, and if you want to get fair market value for 
your property, finding a buyer may take weeks 
or months. Selling costs (agent commissions, 
fix-up expenses, and closing costs) can easily 
approach 10 percent of the home’s value.
A privately run small business is among the 
least liquid of the better growth investments 
that you can make. Selling such a business 
typically takes longer than selling most real 
estate.
So that you’re not forced to sell one of your 
investments that you intend to hold for long-
term purposes, keep an emergency reserve of 
three to six months’ worth of living expenses in 
a money market account. Also consider invest-
ing some money in bonds (see Chapter 8), which 
pay higher than money market yields without 
the high risk or volatility that comes with the 
stock market.

33
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
The erosion of the purchasing power of your investment dollar can, over 
longer time periods, be as bad as or worse than the effect of a major market 
crash. Table 2-2 shows the effective loss in purchasing power of your money 
at various rates of inflation and over differing time periods.

As a financial counselor, I often saw skittish investors try to keep their money 
in bonds and money market accounts, thinking they were playing it safe. The 
risk in this strategy is that your money won’t grow enough over the years in 
order for you to accomplish your financial goals. In other words, the lower 
the return that you earn, the more you need to save to reach a particular 
financial goal.
A 40-year-old wanting to accumulate $500,000 by age 65 would need to save 
$722 per month if she earns a 6 percent average annual return but needs to 
save only $377 per month if she earns 10 percent average return per year. 
Younger investors need to pay the most attention to the risk of generating 
low returns, but so should younger senior citizens. At the age of 65, seniors 
need to recognize that a portion of their assets may not be used for a decade 
or more from the present.
Career risk
 
Your ability to earn money is most likely your single biggest asset, or at 
least one of your biggest assets. Most people achieve what they do in the 
working world through education and hard work. By education, I’m not simply 
talking about what one learns in formal schooling. Education is a lifelong 
process. I’ve learned far more about business from my own front-line experi-
ences and those of others than I’ve learned in educational settings. I also 
read a lot. (In Part V, I recommend books and other resources that I’ve found 
most useful.)

34
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
If you don’t continually invest in your education, you risk losing your compet-
itive edge. Your skills and perspectives can become dated and obsolete. 
Although that doesn’t mean you should work 80 hours a week and never do 
anything fun, it does mean that part of your “work” time should involve 
upgrading your skills.
The best organizations are those that recognize the need for continual knowl-
edge and invest in their workforce through training and career development. 
Just remember to look at your own career objectives, which may not be the 
same as your company’s.
Analyzing Returns
When you make investments, you have the potential to make money in a 
variety of ways. Each type of investment has its own mix of associated risks 
that you take when you part with your investment dollar and, likewise, offers 
a different potential rate of return. In this section, I cover the returns you 
Inflation ragin’ outta control
You think 6, 8, or 10 percent annual inflation 
rates are bad? How would you like to live in a 
country that experienced that rate of inflation in 
a day?! As I discuss in Chapter 4, too much 
money in circulation chasing after too few 
goods causes high rates of inflation.
A government that runs amok with the nation’s 
currency and money supply usually causes 
excessive rates of inflation — dubbed hyperin-
flation. Over the decades and centuries, hyper-
inflation has wreaked havoc in more than a few 
countries.
What happened in Germany in the late 1910s 
and early 1920s demonstrates how bad hyper-
inflation can get. Consider that during this 
time period, prices increased nearly one billion-
fold!!! What cost 1 reichsmark (the German 
currency in those days) at the beginning of this 
mess eventually cost nearly 1,000,000,000 
reichsmarks. People had to cart around so 
much currency that at times they needed 
wheelbarrows to haul it! Ultimately, this infla-
tionary burden was too much for the German 
society, creating a social climate that fueled the 
rise of the Nazi party and Adolf Hitler.
During the 1990s, a number of countries, espe-
cially many that made up the former U.S.S.R. 
and others such as Brazil and Lithuania, got 
themselves into a hyperinflationary mess with 
inflation rates of several hundred percent per 
year. In the mid-1980s, Bolivia’s yearly inflation 
rate exceeded 10,000 percent.
Governments often try to slap on price controls 
to prevent runaway inflation (President Richard 
Nixon did this in the United States in the 1970s), 
but the underground economy, known as the 
black market, usually prevails.

35
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
can expect with each of the common investing avenues, but first, I walk you 
through the different components of calculating the total return on an 
investment.
The components of total return
To figure out exactly how much money you’ve made (or lost) on your invest-
ment, you need to calculate the total return. To come up with this figure, you 
need to determine how much money you originally invested and then factor 
in the other components, such as interest, dividends, and appreciation (or 
depreciation).
If you’ve ever had money in a bank account that pays interest, you know that 
the bank pays you a small amount of interest when you allow it to keep your 
money. The bank then turns around and lends your money to some other 
person or organization at a much higher rate of interest. The rate of interest 
is also known as the yield. So if a bank tells you that its savings account pays 
2 percent interest, the bank may also say that the account yields 2 percent. 
Banks usually quote interest rates or yields on an annual basis. Interest that 
you receive is one component of the return you receive on your investment.
If a bank pays monthly interest, for example, the bank also likely quotes a 
compounded effective annual yield. After the first month’s interest is credited 
to your account, that interest starts earning interest as well. So the bank may 
say that the account pays 2 percent, which compounds to an effective annual 
yield of 2.04 percent.
When you lend your money directly to a company — which is what you do 
when you invest in a bond that a corporation issues — you also receive inter-
est. Bonds, as well as stocks (which are shares of ownership in a company), 
fluctuate in value after they’re issued.
When you invest in a company’s stock, you hope that the stock increases 
(appreciates) in value. Of course, a stock can also decline, or depreciate, in 
value. This change in market value is part of your return from a stock or 
bond investment:
  
Current investment value – Original investment
Original investment
= Appreciation or depreciation
For example, if one year ago you invested $10,000 in a stock (you bought 
1,000 shares at $10 per share), and the investment is now worth $11,000 
(each share is worth $11), your investment’s appreciation is

36
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
  
$11,000 – $10,000
$10,000
= 10%
Stocks can also pay dividends, which are the company’s sharing of some of its 
profits with you as a stockholder. Some companies, particularly those that 
are small or growing rapidly, choose to reinvest all of their profits back into 
the company. (Of course, some companies don’t turn a profit, so there’s 
nothing to pay out!) You need to factor these dividends into your return 
as well.
Suppose that in the previous example, in addition to your stock appreciating 
$1,000 to $11,000, it paid you a dividend of $100 ($1 per share). Here’s how 
you calculate your total return:
  
(Current investment value – Original investment) + Dividends
Original investment
= Total return
Or, to apply it to the example:
  
($11,000 – $10,000) + $100
$10,000
= 11%
After-tax returns
Although you may be happy that your stock has given you an 11 percent 
return on your invested dollars, remember: Unless you held your invest-
ment in a tax-sheltered retirement account, you owe taxes on your return. 
Specifically, the dividends and investment appreciation that you realize 
upon selling are taxed, although often at relatively low rates. The tax rates 
on so-called long-term capital gains and stock dividends are lower than the 
tax rates on other income. In Chapter 3, I discuss the different tax rates 
that affect your investments and explain how to make tax-wise investment 
decisions that fit with your overall personal financial situation and goals.
If you’re talking about savings accounts, money market accounts, or bonds, 
you owe Uncle Sam taxes on the interest.
Often, people make investing decisions without considering the tax conse-
quences of their moves. This is a big mistake. What good is making money if 
the federal and state governments take away a substantial portion of it?
If you’re in a moderate tax bracket, taxes on your investment probably run 
in the neighborhood of 30 percent (federal and state). So if your investment 
returned 7 percent before taxes, you’re left with a return of 4.9 percent 
after taxes.

37
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Psychological returns
Profits and tax avoidance can powerfully motivate your investment selec-
tions. However, as with other life decisions, you need to consider more 
than the bottom line. Some people want to have fun with their investments. 
Of course, they don’t want to lose money or sacrifice a lot of potential 
returns — less expensive ways to have fun do exist!
Psychological rewards compel some investors to choose particular invest-
ment vehicles such as individual stocks, real estate, or a small business. 
Why? Because compared with other investments, such as managed mutual 
funds, they see these investments as more tangible and . . . well, more fun.
 
Be honest with yourself about why you choose the investments that you 
do. Allowing your ego to get in the way can be dangerous. Do you invest in 
individual stocks because you really believe that you can do better than 
the best full-time professional money managers? Chances are high that you 
won’t. (See Chapter 6 for the details.) Do you like investing in real estate more 
because of the gratification from driving by and showing off your properties to 
others than because of their investment rewards? Such questions are worth 
considering as you contemplate what investments you want to make.
Savings and money market 
account returns
You need to keep your extra cash that awaits investment (or an emergency) 
in a safe place, preferably one that doesn’t get hammered by the sea of 
changes in the financial markets. By default and for convenience, many 
people keep their extra cash in a bank savings account. Although the bank 
offers the U.S. government’s backing via the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC), it comes at a high price. Most banks pay a low interest 
rate on their savings accounts.
 
A far better place to keep your liquid savings is in a money market mutual 
fund. These are the safest types of mutual funds around and, for all intents 
and purposes, equal a bank savings account’s safety. However, the best 
money market funds pay higher yields than most bank savings accounts. 
Unlike a bank, money market mutual funds tell you how much they deduct for 
the service of managing your money. If you’re in a higher tax bracket, tax-free 
versions of money funds exist as well. See Chapter 8 for more on money 
market funds.
If you don’t need immediate access to your money, consider using Treasury 
bills (T-bills) or bank certificates of deposit (CDs), which are usually issued 
for terms such as 3, 6, or 12 months. Your money will surely earn more in 
one of these vehicles than in a bank savings account. The drawback to T-bills 

38
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
and bank certificates of deposit is that you incur a penalty (with CDs) or a 
transaction fee (with T-bills) if you withdraw your investment before the term 
expires (see Chapter 7).
Bond returns
When you buy a bond, you lend your money to the issuer of that bond 
(borrower), which is generally the federal government or a corporation, for 
a specific period of time. When you buy a bond, you expect to earn a higher 
yield than you can with a money market or savings account. You’re taking 
more risk, after all. Companies can and do go bankrupt, in which case you 
may lose some or all of your investment.
Generally, you can expect to earn a higher yield when you buy bonds that
 
 Are issued for a longer term: The bond issuer is tying up your money 
at a fixed rate for a longer period of time.
 
 Have lower credit quality: The bond issuer may not be able to repay 
the principal.
Wharton School of Business professor Jeremy Siegel has tracked the perfor-
mance of bonds and stocks all the way back to 1802. Although you may say 
that what happened in the 19th century has little relevance to the financial 
markets and economy of today, the decades since the Great Depression, 
which most other return data track, are a relatively small slice of time. Figure 
2-4 presents the data, so if you’d like to give more emphasis to the recent 
numbers, you may.

 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Note that although the rate of inflation has increased since the Great 
Depression, bond returns have not increased over the decades. Long-term 
bonds maintain slightly higher returns in recent years than short-term bonds. 
The bottom line: Bond investors typically earn about 4 to 5 percent per year.
Stock returns
Investors expect — indeed, they demand — a fair return on investment. And 
if one investment doesn’t offer a high enough rate of return, investors can 
choose to move their money into other investments that they believe will 
perform better. Instead of buying a diversified basket of stocks and holding, 
some investors frequently buy and sell, hoping to cash in on the latest hot 
investment. This tactic seldom works in the long run.
 
Unfortunately, some of these investors use a rearview mirror when they pur-
chase their stocks, chasing after investments that have recently performed 
strongly on the assumption (and the hope) that those investments will 
continue to earn strong returns. But chasing after the strongest performing 
investments can be dangerous if you catch the stock at its peak, ready to 
begin a downward spiral. You may have heard that the goal of investing is to 
buy low and sell high. Chasing high-flying investments can lead you to buy 
high, with the prospect of having to sell low if the stock runs out of steam. 
Even though stocks as a whole have proved to be a good long-term invest-
ment, picking individual stocks is a risky endeavor. See Chapters 5 and 6 for 
advice on making sound stock investment decisions.
 
A tremendous amount of data exists regarding stock market returns. In fact, 
in the U.S. markets, data going back more than two centuries documents 
the fact that stocks have been a terrific long-term investment. The long-term 
returns from stocks that investors have enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, have 
been remarkably constant from one generation to the next.
Going all the way back to 1802, the U.S. stock market has produced an annual 
return of 8.3 percent, while inflation has grown at 1.4 percent per year. Thus, 
after subtracting for inflation, stocks have appreciated about 6.9 percent 
faster annually than the rate of inflation. The U.S. stock market returns have 
consistently and substantially beaten the rate of inflation over the years 
(see Figure 2-5).
Stocks don’t exist only in the United States, of course (see Figure 2-6). More 
than a few U.S. investors seem to forget this fact, especially during the siz-
zling performance of the U.S. stock market during the late 1990s. As I discuss 
in the earlier section “Diversify for a gentler ride,” one advantage of buying 
and holding overseas stocks is that they don’t always fall when U.S. stocks 
drop. In other words, overseas stocks help diversify your portfolio. Although 
stocks worldwide increased greatly since 2002, overseas stocks gained more 
than U.S. stocks, and overseas investors enjoyed even higher returns when 

40
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
foreign currencies appreciated in relation to the U.S. dollar. (Foreign curren-
cies are a source of diversification as well as risk — remember that during 
periods when the U.S. dollar appreciates, that reduces the return of some 
foreign stock investments.)

 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
In addition to enabling U.S. investors to diversify, investing overseas has 
proved to be profitable. The investment banking firm Morgan Stanley tracks 
the performance of stocks in both economically established countries and 
so-called emerging economies. As the name suggests, countries with emerg-
ing economies (for example, Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, 
South Korea, and Taiwan) are “behind” economically but show high rates of 
growth and progress. Faster-growing countries tend to have fast-rising and 
more volatile stock prices.
Real estate returns
 
Over the years, real estate has proved to be similarly lucrative as investing in 
the stock market. Whenever the U.S. has a real estate downturn, folks question 
this historic fact (see Chapter 11 for more details). However, just as stock 
prices have down periods, so too do real estate markets.
The fact that real estate offers solid long-term returns makes sense because 
ultimately, growth in the economy, in jobs, and in population fuels the 
demand for real estate.
Consider what has happened to the U.S. population over the past two 
centuries. In 1800, a mere 5 million people lived within our borders. In 1900, 
that figure grew to 76.1 million, and today, it’s more than 300 million. All of 
these people need places to live, and as long as jobs exist, the income from 
jobs largely fuels the demand for housing.
Businesses and people have an understandable tendency to cluster in major 
cities and suburban towns. Although some people commute, most people 
and businesses locate near airports and major highways. Thus, real estate 
prices in and near major metropolises and suburbs generally appreciate 
the most. Consider the areas of the world that have the most expensive real 
estate prices: Hong Kong, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Boston. 
What these areas have in common are lots of businesses and people and 
limited land.
Contrast these areas with the many rural parts of the United States where 
the price of real estate is relatively low because of the abundant supply of 
buildable land and the relatively lower demand for housing.
Small-business returns
As I discuss in Part IV of this book, you have several choices for tapping into 
the exciting potential of the small-business world. If you have the drive and 
determination, you can start your own small business. Or perhaps you have 
what it takes to buy an existing small business. If you obtain the necessary 
capital and skills to assess opportunities and risk, you can invest in someone 
else’s small business.

42
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
What potential returns can you get from small business? Small-business 
owners like myself who do something they really enjoy will tell you that the 
nonfinancial returns can be huge! The financial rewards can be handsome 
as well.
Every year, Forbes magazine publishes a list of the world’s wealthiest individ-
uals. Perusing this list shows that most of these people built their wealth 
through a significant ownership stake from starting a small business that 
became large. These individuals achieved extraordinarily high effective 
returns (often in excess of hundreds of percent per year) on the amounts 
they invested to get their companies off the ground.
You may also achieve potentially high returns from buying and improving an 
existing small business. As I discuss in Part IV, such small-business invest-
ment returns may be a good deal lower than the returns you may gain from 
starting a business from scratch.
Unlike the stock market, where plenty of historic rate-of-return data exists, 
data on the success, or lack thereof, that investors have had with investing in 
small private companies is harder to come by. Smart venture capitalist firms 
operate a fun and lucrative business: They identify and invest money in 
smaller start-up companies that they hope will grow rapidly and eventually 
go public. Venture capitalists allow outsiders to invest with them via limited 
partnerships. To gain entry, you generally need $1 million to invest. (I never 
said this was an equal-opportunity investment club!)
Venture capitalists, also known as general partners, typically skim off 20 per-
cent of the profits and also charge limited partnership investors a hefty 2 to 
3 percent annual fee on the amount that they’ve invested. The return that’s 
left over for the limited partnership investors isn’t stupendous. According 
to Venture Economics, venture funds have averaged comparable annual 
returns to what stock market investors have earned on average over this 
same period. The general partners that run venture capital funds make more 
than the limited partners do.
You can attempt to do what the general partners do in venture capital firms 
and invest directly in small, private companies. You’re quite likely to be 
investing in much smaller and simpler companies. Earning venture capitalist 
returns isn’t easy to do. If you think that you’re up to the challenge, I explain 
the best ways to invest in small business in Chapter 15.
Considering Your Goals
How much do you need or want to earn? That may seem like an extraordi-
narily stupid question for me to ask you! Who doesn’t want to earn a high 
return? However, although investing in stocks, real estate, or small business 
can produce high long-term returns, you invest in these vehicles with greater 
risk, especially over the short term.

43
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Some people can’t stomach the risk. Others are at a time in their lives 
when they can’t afford to take great risk. If you’re near or in retirement, your 
portfolio and nerves may not be able to wait a decade for your riskier invest-
ments to recover after a major stumble. Perhaps you have sufficient assets to 
accomplish your financial goals and are concerned with preserving what you 
do have, rather than risking it to grow more wealth.
If you work for a living, odds are that you need and want to make your invest-
ments grow at a healthy clip. If your investments grow slowly, you may fall 
short of your goals of owning a home or retiring or changing careers.
Are smaller-company stock returns higher?
Stocks are generally classified by the size of the 
company. Small-company stocks aren’t stocks 
that physically small companies issue — they’re 
simply stocks issued by companies that haven’t 
reached the size of corporate behemoths such 
as IBM, AT&T, or Coca-Cola. The Standard & 
Poor’s 500 index tracks the performance of 500 
large-company stocks in the United States. The 
Russell 2000 index tracks the performance of 
2,000 smaller-company U.S. stocks.
Small-company stocks have outperformed 
larger-company stocks during the past seven 
decades. Historically, small-company stocks 
have produced slightly higher compounded 
annual returns (1.9 percent) than large-
company stocks. However, nearly all of this 
extra performance is due to just one high-
performance time period, from the mid-1970s to 
the early 1980s. If you eliminate this time period 
from the data, small stocks have had virtually 
identical returns to those of larger-company 
stocks.
Also, be aware that small-company stocks can 
get hammered in down markets. For example, 
during the Great Depression, small-company 
stocks plunged more than 85 percent between 
1929 and 1932, while the S&P 500 fell 64 percent.   
In 1937, small-company stocks plummeted 58 
percent; the S&P 500 fell 35 percent. And in 1969 
to 1970, small-company stocks fell 38 percent, 
while the S&P 500 fell just 5 percent. (In the 
early 2000s’ bear market, small stocks fell less 
than large-company stocks).

efore you make any great, wealth-building investments, I recommend 
that you get your financial house in order. The truth is that understand-
ing and implementing some simple personal financial management concepts 
will pay off big for you in the decades ahead.
You want to know how to earn healthy returns on your investments without 
getting clobbered, right? Who doesn’t? Although you generally must accept 
greater risk to have the potential for earning higher returns (see Chapter 2), 
in this chapter I tell you about some free lunches in the world of investing. 
You have a right to be skeptical about free lunches — but this chapter points 
out some easy-to-tap opportunities for managing your money you likely have 
overlooked.
Establishing an Emergency Reserve
You never know what life will bring, so it makes good financial sense to have 
a readily accessible reserve of cash to meet unexpected expenses. If you 
have a sister who works on Wall Street as an investment banker or a wealthy 
and understanding parent, you can use them as your emergency reserve. 
(Although you should ask them how they feel about that before you count 
on receiving funding from them!) If not, the ball’s in your court to establish 
a reserve.

46
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
 
Make sure you have quick access to at least three months’ to as much as 
six months’ worth of living expenses. Keep this emergency money in a high-
yielding money market fund (see Chapter 8). You may also be able to borrow 
against your employer-based retirement account or against your home equity 
should you find yourself in a bind, but these options are much less desirable.
 
If you don’t have a financial safety net, you may be forced into selling an 
investment that you’ve worked hard for. Consider the case of Warren, who 
owned his home as well as an investment property that he rented in the 
Pacific Northwest. He felt, and appeared to be, financially successful. But then 
Warren lost his job, accumulated sizable medical expenses, and had to sell his 
investment property to come up with cash to tide himself over. Warren didn’t 
have enough equity in his home to borrow. He didn’t have other sources — a 
wealthy relative, for example — to borrow from either, so he was stuck selling 
his investment property.
Should you invest emergency money in stocks?
As interest rates drifted lower during the 1990s, 
keeping emergency money in money market 
accounts became less and less rewarding. 
When interest rates were 8 or 10 percent, fewer 
people questioned the wisdom of an emergency 
reserve. However, in the late 1990s, with money 
market interest rates of 5 percent or less and 
stock market returns of 20 percent per year, 
more investors balked at keeping a low-interest 
stash of cash.
I began reading articles that suggested you 
simply keep your emergency reserve in stocks. 
After all, you can easily sell stocks (especially 
those of larger companies) any day the finan-
cial markets are open. Why not treat yourself to 
the 20 percent annual returns that stock market 
investors enjoyed during the 1990s rather than 
earning a paltry 5 percent?
As I discuss in Chapter 2, stocks historically 
have returned about 9 to 10 percent per year. In 
some years — in fact, about one-third of the 
time — stocks decline in value, sometimes 
substantially.
Stocks can drop and have dropped 20, 30, or 50 
percent or more over relatively short periods of 
time. Witness what happened to stock prices in 
the early 2000s. Suppose that such a drop coin-
cides with an emergency — such as the loss of 
your job, major medical bills, and so on. Your 
situation may force you to sell at a loss, perhaps 
a substantial one.
Another reason not to keep emergency money 
in stocks is that if your stocks appreciate 
and you need to sell some of them for emer-
gency cash, you get stuck paying taxes on 
your gains.
I suggest that you invest your emergency money 
in stocks (ideally through well-diversified mutual 
funds) only if you have a relative or some other 
resource to tap for money in an emergency. 
Having a backup resource for money minimizes 
your need to sell your stock holdings on short 
notice. As I discuss in Chapter 5, stocks are 
intended to be a longer-term investment, not an 
investment that you expect (or need) to sell in 
the near future.

47
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
Selling some investments, such as real estate, costs big money (transaction 
costs, taxes, and so on). Warren wasn’t able to purchase another investment 
property and missed out on the large appreciation the property earned over 
the subsequent two decades. Between the costs of selling and taxes, getting 
rid of the investment property cost Warren about 15 percent of its sales 
price. Ouch!
Evaluating Your Debts
Yes, paying down debts is boring, but it makes your investment decisions 
less difficult. Rather than spending so much of your time investigating 
specific investments, paying off your debts (if you have them) may be your 
best high-return, low-risk investment. Consider the interest rate you pay and 
your investing alternatives to determine which debts you should pay off.
Conquering consumer debt
 
Many folks have credit card or other consumer debt, such as auto loans, that 
costs 8, 10, 12, or perhaps as much as 18-plus percent per year in interest 
(some credit cards whack you with interest rates exceeding 20 percent if you 
make a late payment). Reducing and eventually eliminating this debt with your 
savings is like putting your money in an investment with a guaranteed tax-free 
return equal to the rate that you pay on your debt.
For example, if you have outstanding credit card debt at 15 percent interest, 
paying off that debt is the same as putting your money to work in an invest-
ment with a guaranteed 15 percent tax-free annual return. Because the inter-
est on consumer debt isn’t tax-deductible, you need to earn more than 15 
percent investing your money elsewhere in order to net 15 percent after 
paying taxes. Earning such high investing returns is highly unlikely, and in 
order to earn those returns, you’d be forced to take great risk.
Consumer debt is hazardous to your long-term financial health (not to men-
tion the damage it can do to your credit rating and future ability to borrow 
for a home or other wise investments) because it encourages you to borrow 
against your future earnings. I often hear people say such things as “I can’t 
afford to buy most new cars for cash — look at how expensive they are!” 
That’s true, new cars are expensive, so set your sights lower and buy a good 
used car that you can afford. You can then invest the money that you’d 
otherwise spend on your auto loan.
Borrowing via credit cards, auto loans, and the like is also one of the most 
expensive ways to borrow. Banks and other lenders charge higher interest 
rates for consumer debt than for debt for investments, such as real estate 
and business. The reason: Consumer loans are the riskiest type of loan for 
a lender.

48
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
 
However, using consumer debt may make sense if you’re financing a business. 
If you don’t have home equity, personal loans (through a credit card or auto 
loan) may actually be your lowest-cost source of small-business financing. 
(See Chapter 14 for more details.)
Mitigating your mortgage
Paying off your mortgage quicker is an “investment” for your spare cash that 
may make sense for your financial situation. However, the wisdom of making 
this financial move isn’t as clear as is paying off high-interest consumer debt; 
mortgage interest rates are generally lower, and the interest is typically tax-
deductible. When used properly, debt can help you accomplish your goals — 
such as buying a home or starting a business — and make you money in the 
long run. Borrowing to buy a home generally makes sense. Over the long 
term, homes generally appreciate in value.
If your financial situation has changed or improved since you first needed to 
borrow mortgage money, you need to reconsider how much mortgage debt 
you need or want. Even if your income hasn’t escalated or you haven’t inher-
ited vast wealth, your frugality may allow you to pay down some of your debt 
sooner than the lender requires. Whether paying down your debt sooner 
makes sense for you depends on a number of factors, including your other 
investment options and goals.
Consider your investment opportunities
 
When evaluating whether to pay down your mortgage faster, you need to com-
pare your mortgage interest rate versus your investments’ rates of return 
(which I define in Chapter 2). Suppose that you have a fixed-rate mortgage 
with an interest rate of 7 percent. If you decide to make investments instead of 
paying down your mortgage more quickly, your investments need to produce 
an average annual rate of return, before taxes, of about 7 percent to come out 
ahead financially. (This comparison, technically, should be done on an after-
tax basis, but the outcome is unlikely to change.)
Besides the most common reason of lacking the money to do so, other good 
reasons not to pay off your mortgage any quicker than necessary include 
the following:
 
 You instead contribute to your retirement accounts, such as a 401(k), 
an IRA, or a Keogh (especially if your employer offers matching 
money). Paying off your mortgage faster has no tax benefit. By contrast, 
putting additional money into a retirement plan can immediately reduce 
your federal and state income tax burdens. The more years you have 
until retirement, the greater the benefit you receive if you invest in your 
retirement accounts. Thanks to the compounding of your retirement 
account investments without the drain of taxes, you can actually earn a 
lower rate of return on your investments than you pay on your mortgage 

49
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
and still come out ahead. (I discuss the various retirement accounts in 
detail in the “Funding Your Retirement Accounts” section, later in this 
chapter.)
 
 You’re willing to invest in growth-oriented, volatile investments, such 
as stocks and real estate. In order for you to have a reasonable chance 
of earning more on your investments than it costs you to borrow on 
your mortgage, you must be aggressive with your investments. As I dis-
cuss in Chapter 2, stocks and real estate have produced annual average 
rates of return of about 8 to 10 percent. You can earn even more with 
your own small business or investing in others’ businesses. Paying down 
a mortgage ties up more of your capital, reducing your ability to make 
other attractive investments. To more aggressive investors, paying off 
the house seems downright boring — the financial equivalent of 
watching paint dry.
 
 Remember that you have no guarantee of earning high returns from 
growth-type investments, which can easily drop 20 percent or more in 
value over a year or two.
 
 Paying down the mortgage depletes your emergency reserves. 
Psychologically, some people feel uncomfortable paying off debt more 
quickly if it diminishes their savings and investments. You probably 
don’t want to pay down your debt if doing so depletes your financial 
safety cushion. Make sure that you have access — through a money 
market fund or other sources (a family member, for example) — to at 
least three months’ living expenses (as I explain in the earlier section 
“Establishing an Emergency Reserve”).
Finally, don’t be tripped up by the misconception that somehow a real estate 
market downturn, such as many areas experienced in the mid- to late 2000s, 
will harm you more if you pay down your mortgage. Your home is worth what 
it’s worth — its value has nothing to do with your debt load. Unless you’re 
willing to walk away from your home and send the keys to the bank (also 
known as default), you suffer the full effect of a price decline, regardless of 
your mortgage size, if real estate prices collapse.
Don’t get hung up on mortgage tax deductions
Although it’s true that mortgage interest is usually tax-deductible, don’t 
forget (because if you do, you’re sure to end up in trouble with the IRS) that 
you must also pay taxes on investment profits generated outside of retire-
ment accounts. You can purchase tax-free investments like municipal bonds 
(see Chapter 7), but over the long haul, such bonds and other types of lend-
ing investments (bank savings accounts, CDs, and other bonds) are unlikely 
to earn a rate of return that’s higher than the cost of your mortgage.
Don’t assume that those mortgage interest deductions are that great. Just for 
being a living, breathing human being, you automatically qualify for the so-
called “standard deduction” on your federal tax return. In 2008, this standard 
deduction was worth $5,450 for single filers and $10,900 for married people 

50
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
filing jointly. If you have no mortgage interest deductions — or less than you 
used to — you may not be missing out on as much of a write-off as you think. 
(Not to mention that joy of having one less schedule to complete on your 
tax return!)
If you earn a high income, you may not be able to fully deduct your mortgage 
interest on your tax returns. If your adjusted gross income (taxable income 
from all sources before subtracting itemized deductions and personal exemp-
tions) exceeds $159,950 in 2008, you start to lose some of your mortgage 
interest deduction. You lose mortgage interest and other itemized deduc-
tions by 1 percent times the amount that your adjusted gross income 
exceeds $159,950. High-income couples are more likely to be affected by this 
provision because the $159,950 threshold is the same for couples as it is for 
single filers. (This rule is set to expire in 2010.)
Establishing Your Financial Goals
You may want to invest money for different purposes simultaneously. For 
example, when I was in my 20s, I put some money away toward retirement, 
but I also saved a stash so I could hit the eject button from my job in manage-
ment consulting. I knew that I wanted to pursue an entrepreneurial path and 
that in the early years of starting my own business, I couldn’t count on an 
income as stable or as large as I made from consulting.
I invested my two “pots” of money — one for retirement, the other for my 
small-business cushion — quite differently. As I discuss in the section 
“Choosing the Right Investment Mix,” later in this chapter, you can afford to 
take more risk with the money that you plan on using longer term. So I 
invested the bulk of my retirement nest egg in stock mutual funds.
With the money I saved for the start-up of my small business, I took an 
entirely different track. I had no desire to put this money in risky stocks — 
what if the market plummeted just as I was ready to leave the security of my 
full-time job? Thus, I kept this money safely invested in a money market fund 
that paid a healthy rate of interest but didn’t fluctuate in value.
Tracking your savings rate
 
In order to accomplish your financial and some personal goals, you need to 
save money, and you need to know your savings rate. Your savings rate is the 
percentage of your past year’s income that you saved and didn’t spend. You 
may already know that your rate of savings is low, nonexistent, or negative 
and that you need to save more.

51
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
Part of being a smart investor involves figuring out how much you need to 
save to reach your goals. Not knowing what you want to do a decade or more 
from now is perfectly normal — after all, your goals and needs evolve over 
the years. But that doesn’t mean that you should just throw your hands in 
the air and not make an effort to see where you stand today and think about 
where you want to be in the future.
An important benefit of knowing your savings rate is that you’ll know better 
how much risk you need to take to accomplish your goals. Seeing the amount 
that you need to save to achieve your dreams may encourage you to take 
more risk with your investments.
If you consistently save about 10 percent of your income during your working 
years, you’re probably saving enough to meet your goals unless you want to 
retire at a relatively young age. On average, most people need about 75 per-
cent of their pre-retirement income throughout retirement to maintain their 
standards of living.
If you’re one of the many people who don’t save enough, you need to do 
some homework. To save more, you need to reduce your spending, increase 
your income, or both.
 
For most people, reducing spending is the more feasible way to save. But 
where do you begin? First, figure out where your money goes. You may have 
some general idea, but you need to have facts. Get out your checkbook regis-
ter, examine your online bill-paying records, and review your credit card bills 
and any other documentation that you have of your spending history and tally 
up how much you spend on dining out, operating your car(s), paying your 
taxes, and everything else. After you have this information, you can begin to 
prioritize and make the necessary trade-offs to reduce your spending and 
increase your savings rate. Earning more income may help boost your savings 
rate as well. Perhaps you can get a higher-paying job or increase the number 
of hours that you work. But if you already work a lot, reining in your spending 
is usually better for your emotional and economic well-being.
If you don’t know how to evaluate and reduce your spending or haven’t 
thought about your retirement goals, looked into what you can expect from 
Social Security, or calculated how much you should save for retirement, 
now’s the time to do it. Pick up the latest edition of my book Personal Finance 
For Dummies (published by Wiley), and find out all the necessary details for 
retirement planning and much more.
Determining your investment tastes
Many good investing choices exist — you can invest in real estate, the stock 
market, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, your own business or someone 
else’s, or you can pay down mortgage debt more quickly. What makes sense 

52
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
for you depends on your goals as well as your personal preferences. If you 
detest risk-taking and volatile investments, paying down your mortgage, as 
recommended earlier in this chapter, may make better sense than investing 
in the stock market.
How would you deal with an investment that plunges 20 percent, 40 percent, 
or more in a few years or less? Some aggressive investments can fall fast. 
(See Chapter 2 for examples.) You shouldn’t go into the stock market, real 
estate, or a small-business investment arena if such a drop is likely to cause 
you to sell low or make you a miserable wreck. If you haven’t tried riskier 
investments yet, you may want to experiment a bit to see how you feel with 
your money invested in them.
 
A simple way to “mask” the risk of volatile investments is to diversify your 
portfolio — that is, to put your money into different investments. Not watch-
ing prices too closely helps, too — that’s one of the reasons real estate 
investors are less likely to bail out when the market declines. Stock market 
investors, unfortunately from my perspective, can get daily and even minute-
by-minute price updates. Add that fact to the quick phone call or click of your 
computer mouse that it takes to dump a stock in a flash, and you have all the 
ingredients for short-sighted investing — and financial disaster.
Funding Your Retirement Accounts
 
Saving money is difficult for most people. Don’t make a tough job impossible 
by forsaking the terrific tax benefits that come from investing through most 
retirement accounts.
Gaining tax benefits
Retirement accounts should be called tax-reduction accounts — if they were, 
people might be more jazzed about contributing to them. Contributions to 
these plans are generally federal- and state-tax deductible. Suppose that you 
pay about 35 percent between federal and state income taxes on your last 
dollars of income. (See the section “Determining your tax bracket,” later in 
this chapter.) With most of the retirement accounts that I describe in this 
chapter, you can save yourself about $350 in taxes for every $1,000 that you 
contribute in the year that you make your contribution.
After your money is in a retirement account, any interest, dividends, and 
appreciation grow inside the account without taxation. With most retirement 
accounts, you defer taxes on all the accumulating gains and profits until you 
withdraw your money down the road, which you can do without penalty after 
age 591/2. In the meantime, more of your money works for you over a long 
period of time. In some cases, such as with the Roth IRAs described in the 
“IRAs” section later in this chapter, withdrawals are tax free, too.

53
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
The good old U.S. government now provides a tax credit for lower-income 
earners who contribute up to $2,000 into retirement accounts. The maximum 
credit of 50 percent applies to the first $2,000 contributed for single taxpay-
ers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of no more than $15,000 and married 
couples filing jointly with an AGI of $30,000 or less. Singles with an AGI of 
between $15,000 and $16,250 and married couples with an AGI between 
Investing as couples
You’ve probably learned over the years how 
challenging it is just for you to navigate the 
investment maze and make sound investing 
decisions. When you have someone else to 
consider, dealing with these issues becomes 
doubly hard, given the typically different money 
personalities and emotions that come 
into play.
In most couples with whom I’ve worked as a 
financial counselor, usually one person takes 
primary responsibility for managing the house-
hold finances, including investments. As with 
most marital issues, the couples that do the best 
job with their investments are those who com-
municate well, plan ahead, and compromise.
Here are a couple of examples to illustrate my 
point. Martha and Alex scheduled meetings 
with each other every three to six months to dis-
cuss financial issues. With investments, Martha 
came prepared with a list of ideas, and Alex 
would listen and explain what he liked or dis-
liked about each option. Alex would tend toward 
more aggressive, growth-oriented investments, 
whereas Martha preferred conservative, less 
volatile investments. Inevitably, they would 
compromise and develop a diversified portfolio 
that was moderately aggressive. Martha and 
Alex worked as a team, discussed options, com-
promised, and made decisions they were both 
comfortable with. Ideas that made one of them 
very uncomfortable were nixed.
Henry and Melissa didn’t do so well. The only 
times they managed to discuss investments 
were in heated arguments. Melissa often 
criticized what Henry was doing with their 
money. Henry got defensive and counter-
criticized Melissa for other issues. Much of 
their money lay dormant in a low-interest bank 
account, and they did little long-term planning 
and decision making. Melissa and Henry saw 
each other as adversaries, argued and criticized 
rather than discussed, and were plagued with 
inaction because they couldn’t agree and com-
promise. They needed a motivation to change 
their behavior toward each other and some 
counseling (or a few advice guides for couples) 
to make progress with investing their money.
Aren’t your long-term financial health and mari-
tal harmony important? Don’t allow your prob-
lems to fester! Remember what the famous 
psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw says about prob-
lems and making changes: “You can’t change 
what you don’t acknowledge.” I couldn’t agree 
more with this assessment when it comes to 
money problems, including investing issues.
In my work as a financial counselor, one of the 
most valuable and difficult things that I did for 
couples stuck in unproductive patterns of 
behavior was help them get the issue out on the 
table. For these couples, the biggest step was 
making an appointment to discuss their finan-
cial management. Once they did, it was rela-
tively easy for me to get them to explain their 
different points of view, which enabled me to 
offer compromises. To find out more about how 
to manage money amicably with others, please 
see my book Let’s Get Real About Money 
(FT Press).

with an AGI of more than $16,250 but no more than $25,000 and married cou-
ples with an AGI not exceeding $50,000 can get a 10 percent tax credit.
Delaying increases your pain
 
The common mistake that investors make is neglecting to take advantage of 
retirement accounts because of their enthusiasm to spend or invest in “non-
retirement” accounts. Not investing in tax-sheltered retirement accounts can 
cost you hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars per year in lost tax savings. 
Add that loss up over the many years that you work and save, and not taking 
advantage of these tax reduction accounts can easily cost you tens of thou-
sands to hundreds of thousands of dollars in the long term. Ouch!
To take advantage of retirement savings plans and the tax savings that 
accompany them, you must first spend less than you earn. Only after you 
spend less than you earn can you afford to contribute to these retirement 
savings plans (unless you already happen to have a stash of cash from previ-
ous savings or inheritance).
 
The sooner you start to save, the less painful it is each year to save enough to 
reach your goals because your contributions have more years to compound.
Each decade you delay saving approximately doubles the percentage of your 
earnings that you need to save to meet your goals. For example, if saving 5 
percent per year in your early 20s gets you to your retirement goal, waiting 
until your 30s to start may mean socking away 10 percent to reach that same 
goal; waiting until your 40s, 20 percent. Beyond that, the numbers get truly 
daunting.
If you enjoy spending money and living for today, you should be more moti-
vated to start saving sooner. The longer that you wait to save, the more you 
ultimately need to save and, therefore, the less you can spend today!
Checking out retirement account options
If you earn employment income (or receive alimony), you have option(s) for 
putting money away in a retirement account that compounds without taxa-
tion until you withdraw the money. In most cases, your contributions to 
retirement accounts are tax-deductible.
Company-based plans
If you work for a for-profit company, you may have access to a 401(k) plan 
that typically allows you to save up to $15,500 per year (for tax year 2008). 
Many nonprofit organizations offer 403(b) plans to their employees. As with 

55
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
a 401(k), your contributions to 403(b) plans are federal- and state-tax deduct-
ible in the year that you make them. Nonprofit employees can generally 
contribute up to 20 percent or $15,500 of their salaries, whichever is less. 
In addition to the upfront and ongoing tax benefits of such plans, some 
employers match your contributions.
Older employees (defined as being at least age 50) can contribute even more 
into these company-based plans — up to $20,500 in 2008. Of course, the chal-
lenge for many people is to reduce their spending enough to be able to sock 
away these kinds of contributions.
If you’re self-employed, you can establish your own retirement savings plans 
for yourself and any employees that you have. In fact, with all types of self-
employed retirement plans, business owners need to cover their employees 
as well. Simplified employee pension individual retirement accounts (SEP-IRA) 
and Keogh plans allow you to sock away about 20 percent of your self-
employment income (business revenue minus expenses), up to an annual 
maximum of $46,000 (for tax year 2008). Each year, you decide the amount 
you want to contribute — no minimums exist (unless you do a Money 
Purchase Pension Plan type of Keogh).
Keogh plans require a bit more paperwork to set up and administer than 
SEP-IRAs. Unlike SEP-IRAs, Keogh plans allow vesting schedules that require 
employees to remain with the company a number of years before they earn 
the right to their retirement account balances. (If you’re an employee in a 
small business, you can’t establish your own SEP-IRA or Keogh — that’s up to 
your employer.)
If an employee leaves prior to being fully vested, his unvested balance 
reverts to the remaining Keogh plan participants. Keogh plans also allow for 
Social Security integration, which effectively allows those in the company 
who earn high incomes (usually the owners) to receive larger-percentage 
contributions for their accounts than the less highly compensated employ-
ees. The logic behind this idea is that Social Security taxes and benefits top 
out after you earn $102,000 (for tax year 2008). Social Security integration 
allows higher-income earners to make up for this ceiling.
Owners of small businesses shouldn’t deter themselves from keeping such a 
plan because employees may receive contributions, too. If business owners 
take the time to educate employees about the value and importance of these 
plans in saving for the future and reducing taxes, they’ll see it rightfully as 
part of their total compensation package. In addition to the vesting schedules 
and Social Security integration discussed earlier in this section, many plans 
allow business owners to exclude employees from receiving contributions 
until they complete a year or two of service.

IRAs
 
If you work for a company that doesn’t offer a retirement savings plan, or if 
you’ve exhausted contributing to your company’s plan, consider an individual 
retirement account (IRA). Anyone with employment (or alimony) income may 
contribute up to $5,000 each year to an IRA, or the amount of your employ-
ment or alimony income if it’s less than $5,000 in a year. If you’re a nonwork-
ing spouse, you’re eligible to put up to $5,000 per year into a spousal IRA. 
Those age 50 and older can put away up to $6,000 per year (effective in 2008).
Your contributions to an IRA may or may not be tax-deductible. For tax year 
2008, if you’re single and your adjusted gross income is $53,000 or less for the 
year, you can deduct your full IRA contribution. If you’re married and you file 
your taxes jointly, you’re entitled to a full IRA deduction if your AGI (adjusted 
gross income) is $83,000 per year or less.
If you can’t deduct your contribution to a standard IRA account, consider 
making a contribution to a nondeductible IRA account called the Roth IRA. 
Single taxpayers with an AGI less than $101,000 and joint filers with an AGI 
less than $159,000 can contribute up to $5,000 per year to a Roth IRA, $6,000 
for those age 50 and older. Although the contribution isn’t deductible, 
earnings inside the account are shielded from taxes, and unlike a standard 
IRA, qualified withdrawals from the account are free from income tax.
Annuities
If you’ve contributed all you’re legally allowed to your IRA accounts and still 
want to put away more money into retirement accounts, consider annuities. 
Annuities are contracts that insurance companies back. If you, the annuity 
holder (investor), should die during the so-called accumulation phase (that is, 
prior to receiving payments from the annuity), your designated beneficiary is 
guaranteed reimbursement of the amount of your original investment.
Annuities, like IRAs, allow your capital to grow and compound tax deferred. 
You defer taxes until you withdraw the money. However, unlike an IRA that 
has an annual contribution limit of a few thousand dollars, you can deposit as 
much as you want in any year into an annuity — even millions of dollars, if 
you’ve got it! However, as with a Roth IRA, you get no upfront tax deduction 
for your contributions.
 
Because annuity contributions aren’t tax-deductible, and because annuities 
carry higher annual operating fees to pay for the small insurance that comes 
with them, don’t consider contributing to one until you’ve fully exhausted 
your other retirement account investing options. Because of their higher 
annual expenses, annuities generally make sense only if you have 15 or more 
years to wait until you need the money.

57
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
Choosing retirement account investments
When you establish a retirement account, you may not realize that the retire-
ment account is simply a shell or shield that keeps the federal, state, and 
local governments from taxing your investment earnings each year. You still 
must choose what investments you want to hold inside your retirement 
account shell.
You may invest your IRA or other self-employed plan retirement account 
(SEP-IRAs, Keoghs) money into stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and even bank 
accounts. Mutual funds (offered in most employer-based plans), which I 
cover in detail in Chapter 8, are an ideal choice because they offer diversifica-
tion and professional management. After you decide which financial institu-
tion you want to invest through, simply obtain and complete the appropriate 
paperwork for establishing the specific type of account you want.
Taming Your Taxes
When you invest outside of tax-sheltered retirement accounts, the profits 
and distributions on your money are subject to taxation. So the type of non-
retirement account investments that makes sense for you depends (at least 
partly) on your tax situation.
If you have money to invest, or if you’re considering selling current invest-
ments that you hold, taxes should factor into your decision. But tax consider-
ations alone shouldn’t dictate how and where you invest your money. You 
should also weigh investment choices, your desire and the necessity to take 
risk, personal likes and dislikes, and the number of years you plan to hold the 
investment (see the “Choosing the Right Investment Mix” section, later in the 
chapter, for more information on these other factors).
Determining your tax bracket
You may not know it, but the government charges you different tax rates for 
different parts of your annual income. You pay less tax on the first dollars of 
your earnings and more tax on the last dollars of your earnings. For example, 
if you’re single and your taxable income totaled $50,000 during 2008, you paid 
federal tax at the rate of 10 percent on the first $8,025, 15 percent on the 
taxable income above $8,025 up to $32,550, and 25 percent on income above 
$32,550 up to $50,000.

58
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Your marginal tax rate is the rate of tax that you pay on your last or so-called 
highest dollars of income. In the example of a single person with taxable 
income of $50,000, that person’s federal marginal tax rate is 25 percent. In 
other words, he effectively pays a 25 percent federal tax on his last dollars of 
income — those dollars earned between $32,550 and $50,000. (Don’t forget to 
factor in state income taxes that most states assess.)
Knowing your marginal tax rate allows you to quickly calculate the following:
 
 Any additional taxes that you would pay on additional income
 
 The amount of taxes that you save if you contribute more money into 
retirement accounts or reduce your taxable income (for example, if you 
choose investments that produce tax-free income)

Knowing what’s taxed and when to worry
Interest you receive from bank accounts and corporate bonds is generally 
taxable. U.S. Treasury bonds pay interest that is state-tax-free. Municipal 
bonds, which state and local governments issue, pay interest that is federal-
tax-free and also state-tax-free to residents in the state where the bond is 
issued. (I discuss bonds in Chapter 7.)
Taxation on your capital gains, which is the profit (sales minus purchase 
price) on an investment, works under a unique system. Investments held less 
than one year generate short-term capital gains, which are taxed at your 
normal marginal rate. Profits from investments that you hold longer than 12 
months are long-term capital gains that cap at 15 percent, except for those in 
the two lowest tax brackets of 10 and 15 percent, for whom the long-term 

59
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
capital gains tax rate is just 5 percent. (Note: As this book went to press just 
prior to the 2008 presidential election, the outcome of that election could 
alter tax rates across the board because the Democratic candidate has indi-
cated a likelihood to raise rates.)
 
Use these strategies to reduce the taxes on investments exposed to taxation:
 
 Use tax-free money markets and bonds. If you’re in a high enough tax 
bracket, you may find that you come out ahead with tax-free invest-
ments. Tax-free investments yield less than comparable investments 
that produce taxable earnings, but because of the tax differences, the 
earnings from tax-free investments can end up being greater than what 
taxable investments leave you with. In order to compare properly, 
subtract what you’ll pay in federal as well as state taxes from the taxable 
investment to see which investment nets you more.
 
 Invest in tax-friendly stock funds. Index funds are mutual funds that 
invest in a relatively static portfolio of securities, such as stocks and 
bonds. They don’t attempt to beat the market. Rather, they invest in 
the securities to mirror or match the performance of an underlying 
index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 (which I discuss in Chapter 5). 
Although index funds can’t beat the market, the typical actively man-
aged fund doesn’t either, and index funds have several advantages over 
actively managed funds. Because index funds trade less, they tend to 
produce lower capital gains distributions. For mutual funds held outside 
tax-sheltered retirement accounts, this reduced trading effectively 
increases an investor’s total rate of return. See Chapter 8 to find out 
more about tax-friendly stock mutual funds.
 
 Invest in small business and real estate. The growth in value of a 
business and real estate asset isn’t taxed until you sell the asset. Even 
then, with investment real estate, you often can roll over the gain into 
another property as long as you comply with tax laws. However, the 
current income that a small business and real estate produce is taxed as 
ordinary income.
 
Short-term capital gains (investments held one year or less) are taxed at your 
ordinary income tax rate. This fact is another reason that you shouldn’t trade 
your investments quickly (within 12 months).
Choosing the Right Investment Mix
Diversifying your investments helps buffer your portfolio from being sunk by 
one or two poor performers. In this section, I explain how to mix up a great 
recipe of investments.

60
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Considering your age
When you’re younger and have more years until you plan to use your money, 
you should keep larger amounts of your long-term investment money in 
growth (ownership) vehicles, such as stocks, real estate, and small business. 
As I discuss in Chapter 2, the attraction of these types of investments is the 
potential to really grow your money. The risk: The value of your portfolio can 
fall from time to time.
The younger you are, the more time your investments have to recover from a 
bad fall. In this respect, investments are a bit like people. If a 30-year-old and 
an 80-year-old fall on a concrete sidewalk, odds are higher that the younger 
person will fully recover. Such falls sometimes disable older people.
 
A long-held guiding principle says to subtract your age from 110 and invest the 
resulting number as a percentage of money to place in growth (ownership) 
investments. So if you’re 35 years old:
110 – 35 = 75 percent of your investment money can be in growth 
investments.
If you want to be more aggressive, subtract your age from 120:
120 – 35 = 85 percent of your investment money can be in growth 
investments.
Note that even retired people should still have a healthy chunk of their 
investment dollars in growth vehicles like stocks. A 70-year-old person may 
want to totally avoid risk, but doing so is generally a mistake. Such a person 
can live another two or three decades. If you live longer than anticipated, 
you can run out of money if it doesn’t continue to grow.
 
These tips are only general guidelines and apply to money that you invest for 
the long term (ideally for ten years or more). For money that you need to use 
in the shorter term, such as within the next several years, more-aggressive 
growth investments aren’t appropriate. See Chapters 7 and 8 for more ideas.
Making the most of your 
investment options
No hard-and-fast rules dictate how to allocate the percentage that you’ve 
earmarked for growth investments among specific investments, like stocks 
and real estate. Part of how you decide to allocate your investments depends, 
for example, on the types of investments that you want to focus on. As I 
discuss in Chapter 5, diversifying in stocks worldwide can be prudent as well 
as profitable.

61
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
Here are some general guidelines to keep in mind:
 
 Take advantage of your retirement accounts. Unless you need accessi-
ble money for shorter-term non-retirement goals, why pass up the free 
extra returns from the tax benefits of retirement accounts?
 
 Don’t pile into investments that gain lots of attention. Many investors 
make this mistake, especially those who lack a thought-out plan to buy 
stocks. In Chapter 5, I provide numerous illustrations of the perils of 
buying attention-grabbing stocks.
 
 Have the courage to be a contrarian. No one likes to feel that he is 
jumping on board a sinking ship or supporting a losing cause. However, 
just like shopping for something at retail stores, the best time to buy 
something is when its price is reduced.
 
 Diversify. As I discuss in Chapter 2, the values of different investments 
don’t move in tandem. So when you invest in growth investments, such 
as stocks or real estate, your portfolio’s value will have a smoother ride 
if you diversify properly.
 
 Invest more in what you know. Over the years, I’ve met successful 
investors who have built substantial wealth without spending gobs of 
their free time researching, selecting, and monitoring investments. Some 
investors, for example, concentrate more on real estate because that’s 
what they best understand and feel comfortable with. Others put more 
money in stocks for the same reason. No one-size-fits-all code exists for 
successful investors. Just be careful that you don’t put all your investing 
eggs in the same basket (for example, don’t load up on stocks in the 
same industry that you believe you know a lot about).
 
 Don’t invest in too many different things. Diversification is good to a 
point. If you purchase so many investments that you can’t perform a 
basic annual review of them (for example, reading the annual report 
from your mutual fund), you have too many investments.
 
 Be more aggressive inside retirement accounts. When you hit your 
retirement years, you’ll probably begin to live off your non-retirement 
account investments first. Why? For the simple reason that allowing 
your retirement accounts to continue growing will save you tax dollars. 
Therefore, you should be relatively less aggressive with investments 
outside of retirement accounts because that money will be invested for 
a shorter time period.
Easing into risk: Dollar cost averaging
Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is the practice of investing a regular amount of 
money at set time intervals, such as monthly or quarterly, into volatile invest-
ments, such as stocks and stock mutual funds. If you’ve ever deducted 
money from a paycheck and pumped it into a retirement savings plan invest-
ment account that holds stocks and bonds, you’ve done DCA.

62
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
 
Most of us invest a portion of our employment compensation as we earn it, 
but if you have extra cash sitting around, you can choose to invest that money 
in one fell swoop or to invest it gradually via DCA. The biggest appeal of 
gradually feeding money into the market via DCA is that you don’t dump 
all of your money into a potentially overheated investment just before a major 
drop. Thus, DCA helps shy investors to psychologically ease into riskier 
investments.
DCA is made to order for skittish investors with a large lump sum of money 
sitting in safe investments like CDs or a savings account. For example, 
using DCA, an investor with $100,000 to invest in stock funds can feed her 
money into investments gradually — say, at the rate of $12,500 or so quar-
terly over two years — instead of investing her entire $100,000 in stocks 
at once and possibly buying all of her shares at a market peak. Most large 
investment companies, especially mutual funds, allow investors to establish 
automatic investment plans so the DCA occurs without an investor’s 
ongoing involvement.
Of course, like any risk-reducing investment strategy, DCA has drawbacks. 
If growth investments appreciate (as they’re supposed to), a DCA investor 
misses out on earning higher returns on his money awaiting investment. 
Finance professors Richard E. Williams and Peter W. Bacon found that 
approximately two-thirds of the time, a lump-sum stock market investor 
earned higher first-year returns than an investor who fed the money in 
monthly over the first year. (They studied data from the U.S. market over 
the past seven decades.)
However, knowing that you’ll probably be ahead most of the time if you 
dump a lump sum into the stock market is little solace if you happen to invest 
just before a major plunge in the stock market. In the fall of 1987, the U.S. 
stock market, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, plummeted 
36 percent, and from 1973 to 1974, the market shed 45 percent of its value.
So investors who fear that stocks are due for such a major correction should 
practice DCA, right? Well, not so fast. Apprehensive investors who shun 
lump-sum investments and use DCA are more likely to stop the DCA invest-
ment process if prices plunge, thereby defeating the benefit of doing DCA 
during a declining market.
So what’s an investor with a lump sum of money to do?
 
 First, weigh the significance of the lump sum to you. Although $100,000 
is a big chunk of most people’s net worth, it’s only 10 percent if your net 
worth is $1,000,000. It’s not worth a millionaire’s time to use DCA. If the 
cash that you have to invest is less than a quarter of your net worth, you 
may not want to bother with DCA.
 
 Second, consider how aggressively you invest (or invested) your 
money. For example, if you aggressively invested your money through 
an employer’s retirement plan that you roll over, don’t waste your time 
on DCA.

63
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
DCA makes sense for investors with a large chunk of their net worth in cash 
who want to minimize the risk of transferring that cash to riskier invest-
ments, such as stocks. If you fancy yourself a market prognosticator, you can 
also assess the current valuation of stocks. Thinking that stocks are pricey 
(and thus riper for a fall) increases the appeal of DCA.
 
Over how long a time period should you practice DCA? If you use DCA too 
quickly, you may not give the market sufficient time for a correction to unfold, 
during and after which some of the DCA purchases may take place. If you prac-
tice DCA over too long of a period of time, you may miss a major upswing in 
stock prices. I suggest using DCA over one to two years to strike a balance.
As for the times of the year that you should use DCA, mutual fund investors 
should DCA quarterly early in each calendar quarter because mutual funds 
that make taxable distributions tend to do so late in the quarter.
Your money that awaits investment should have a suitable parking place. 
Select a high-yielding money market fund that’s appropriate for your tax 
situation.
One last critical point: When you use DCA, establish an automatic investment 
plan so you’re less likely to chicken out. And for the more courageous, you 
may want to try an alternative strategy to DCA — value averaging, which 
allows you to invest more if prices are falling and invest less if prices 
are rising.
Suppose that you want to value average $500 per quarter into an aggressive 
stock mutual fund. After your first quarterly $500 investment, the fund 
drops 10 percent, reducing your account balance to $450. Value averaging 
has you invest $500 the next quarter plus another $50 to make up the short-
fall. (Conversely, if the fund value had increased to $550 after your first 
investment, you would invest only $450 in the second round.) Increasing the 
amount that you invest requires confidence when prices fall, but doing so 
magnifies your returns when prices ultimately turn around.
Treading Carefully When 
Investing for College
 
Many well-intentioned parents want to save for their children’s future educa-
tional expenses. The mistake that they often make, however, is putting money 
in accounts in their child’s name (in so-called custodial accounts) or saving 
outside retirement accounts in general.

64
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
The more money you accumulate outside tax-sheltered retirement accounts, 
the less assistance you’re likely to qualify for from federal and state financial 
aid sources. Don’t make the additional error of assuming that financial aid 
is only for the poor. Many middle-income and even some modestly affluent 
families qualify for some aid, which can include grants and loans available, 
even if you’re not deemed financially needy.
Under the current financial needs analysis that most colleges use in awarding 
financial aid, the value of your retirement plan is not considered an asset. 
Money that you save outside retirement accounts, including money in the 
child’s name, is counted as an asset and reduces eligibility for financial aid.
Also, be aware that your family’s assets, for purposes of financial aid determi-
nation, also generally include equity in real estate and businesses that you 
own. Although the federal financial aid analysis no longer counts equity in 
your primary residence as an asset, many private (independent) schools con-
tinue to ask parents for this information when they make their own financial 
aid determinations. Thus, paying down your home mortgage more quickly 
instead of funding retirement accounts can harm you financially. You may 
end up with less financial aid and pay more in taxes.
 
Don’t forgo contributing to your own retirement savings plan(s) in order to 
save money in a non-retirement account for your children’s college expenses. 
When you do, you pay higher taxes both on your current income and on the 
interest and growth of this money. In addition to paying higher taxes, you’re 
expected to contribute more to your child’s educational expenses.
If you plan to apply for financial aid, it’s a good idea to save non-retirement 
account money in your name rather than in your children’s names (custodial 
accounts). Colleges expect a greater percentage of money in your child’s 
name (35 percent) to be used for college costs than money in your name 
(6 percent).
However, if you’re affluent enough that you expect to pay for your cherub’s 
full educational costs, you can save a bit on taxes if you invest through 
custodial accounts. Prior to your child reaching age 19, the first $1,800 of 
interest and dividend income is taxed at your child’s income tax rate rather 
than yours. After age 19 (for full-time students, it’s those under the age of 24), 
all income that the investments in your child’s name generate is taxed at 
your child’s rate.
Education Savings Accounts
 
Be careful about funding an Education Savings Account (ESA), a relatively new 
savings vehicle. In theory, ESAs sound like a great place to park some college 
savings. You can make nondeductible contributions of up to $2,000 per child 
per year, and investment earnings and account withdrawals are free of tax 
as long as you use the funds to pay for elementary and secondary school or 

65
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
college costs. Funding an ESA can undermine your child’s ability to qualify for 
financial aid. It’s best to keep the parents as the owners of such an account for 
financial aid purposes, but be forewarned that some schools may treat money 
in an ESA as a student’s asset.
Section 529 plans
Also known as qualified state tuition plans, Section 529 plans offer a tax-
advantaged way to save and invest more than $100,000 per child toward 
college costs (some states allow upward of $300,000 per student). After you 
contribute to one of these state-based accounts, the invested funds grow 
without taxation. Withdrawals are also tax free so long as the funds are 
used to pay for qualifying higher educational costs (which include college, 
graduate school, and attendance expenses of special-needs students). The 
schools need not be in the same state as the state administering the Section 
529 plan.
As I discuss in the previous section dealing with Education Savings Accounts, 
Section 529 plan balances can harm your child’s financial aid chances. 
Thus, such accounts make the most sense for affluent families who are sure 
that they won’t qualify for any type of financial aid. And as with ESAs, keep 
parents as owners of these accounts for assistance with financial aid issues.
Allocating college investments
 
If you keep up to 80 percent of your investment money in stocks (diversified 
worldwide) with the remainder in bonds when your child is young, you can 
maximize the money’s growth potential without taking extraordinary risk. As 
your child makes his way through the later years of elementary school, you 
need to begin to make the mix more conservative — scale back the stock 
percentage to 50 or 60 percent. Finally, in the years just before entering 
college, whittle the stock portion down to no more than 20 percent or so.
Diversified mutual funds (which invest in stocks in the United States and 
internationally) and bonds are ideal vehicles to use when you invest for 
college. Be sure to choose funds that fit your tax situation if you invest your 
funds in non-retirement accounts. See Chapter 8 for more information.
Protecting Your Assets
You may be at risk of making a catastrophic investing mistake: not protecting 
your assets properly due to a lack of various insurance coverages. That’s the

a lot of his own personal money and sweat into building the business over 
15 years.
One day, catastrophe struck: An explosion ripped through his building, and 
the ensuing fire destroyed virtually all the firm’s equipment and inventory, 
none of which was insured. The explosion also seriously injured several 
workers, including Manny, who didn’t carry disability insurance. Ultimately, 
Manny had to file bankruptcy.
 
Decisions regarding what amount of insurance you need to carry are, to some 
extent, a matter of your desire and ability to accept financial risk. But some 
risks aren’t worth taking. Don’t overestimate your ability to predict what 
accidents and other bad luck may befall you. Here’s what you need to protect 
yourself and your assets:
 
 Major medical health insurance: I’m not talking about one of those poli-
cies that pays $100 a day if you need to go into the hospital, or cancer 
insurance, or that $5,000 medical expense rider on your auto insurance 
policy. I know it’s unpleasant to consider, but you need a policy that 
pays for all types of major illnesses and major expenditures. Consider 
taking a health plan with a high deductible, which will minimize your 
premiums. Channel extra money into a Health Savings Account (HSA), 
which provides tremendous tax breaks. As with a retirement account, 
money can grow over the years in an HSA without taxation, and you can 
tap HSA funds without penalty or taxation for a wide range of current 
health expenses.
 
 Adequate liability insurance on your home and car to guard your 
assets against lawsuits: You should have at least enough liability insur-
ance to protect your net worth (assets minus your liabilities/debts) or, 
ideally, twice your net worth. If you run your own business, get insur-
ance for your business assets if they’re substantial, such as in Manny’s 
case. Also consider professional liability insurance to protect against a 
lawsuit. You may also want to consider incorporating your business 
(which I discuss more in Chapter 14).
 
 Long-term disability insurance: What would you (and your family) do to 
replace your income if a major disability prevents you from working? 
Even if you don’t have dependents, odds are that you are dependent on 
you. Most larger employers offer group plans that have good benefits 
and are much less expensive than coverage you’d buy on your own. 
Also, check with your professional association for a competitive 
group plan.
 
 Life insurance if others are dependent on your income: If you’re single 
or your loved ones can live without your income, skip life insurance. If 
you need coverage, buy term insurance that, like your auto and home 
insurance, is pure insurance protection. The amount of term insurance 
you need to buy largely depends on how much of your income you want 
to replace.

 Estate planning: At a minimum, most people need a simple will to delin-
eate to whom they would like to leave all their worldly possessions. If 
you hold significant assets outside retirement accounts, you may also 
benefit from establishing a living trust, which keeps your money from 
filtering through the hands of probate lawyers. Living wills and medical 
powers of attorney are useful to have in case you’re ever in a medically 
incapacitated situation. If you have substantial assets, doing more 
involved estate planning is wise to minimize estate taxes and ensure the 
orderly passing of your assets to your heirs.
How to pay for college
If you keep stashing away money in retirement 
accounts, it’s reasonable for you to wonder how 
you’ll actually pay for education expenses when 
the momentous occasion arises. Even if you 
have some liquid assets that can be directed to 
your child’s college bill, you will, in all likelihood, 
need to borrow some money. Only the affluent 
can truly afford to pay for college with cash.
One good source of money is your home’s 
equity. You can borrow against your home at a 
relatively low interest rate, and the interest is 
generally tax-deductible. Some company retire-
ment plans — 401(k)s, for example — allow bor-
rowing as well.
A plethora of financial aid programs allow you 
to borrow at reasonable interest rates. The 
Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and Parent Loans 
for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), for exam-
ple, are available, even when your family isn’t 
deemed financially needy. In addition to loans, 
a number of grant programs are available 
through schools and the government, as well as 
through independent sources.
Complete the Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid (FAFSA) to apply for the federal 
government programs. Grants available through 
state government programs may require a sep-
arate application. Specific colleges and other 
private organizations, including employers, 
banks, credit unions, and community groups, 
also offer grants and scholarships.
Many scholarships and grants don’t require any 
work on your part — simply apply for such 
financial aid through your college. However, 
you may need to seek out other programs — 
check directories and databases at your local 
library, your kid’s school counseling depart-
ment, and college financial aid offices. Also try 
local organizations, churches, employers, and 
so on because you have a better chance of get-
ting scholarship money through these avenues 
than through countrywide scholarship and grant 
databases.
Your child can work and save money during 
high school and college for school. In fact, if 
your child qualifies for financial aid, she’s gen-
erally expected to contribute a certain amount 
to education costs from employment (both 
during the school year and summer breaks) and 
from savings. Besides giving your gangly teen a 
stake in her own future, this training encour-
ages sound personal financial management 
down the road.

In my experience as a financial counselor, I’ve seen that although many 
people lack particular types of insurance, others possess unnecessary 
policies. Many people also keep very low deductibles. Remember to insure 
against potential losses that would be financially catastrophic for you — 
don’t waste your money to protect against smaller losses. (See the latest 
edition of my book Personal Finance For Dummies, published by Wiley, to 
discover the right and wrong ways to buy insurance, what to look for in 
policies, and where to get good policies.)

spending some time understanding how and why the financial markets function 
will make you more comfortable with investing and make you a better investor.
In this chapter, I tell you the ways that companies raise capital and give you a 
brief primer on financial markets and economics so you can understand and 
be comfortable with investing in the financial markets.
How Companies Raise Money 
through the Financial Markets
All businesses start small — whether it’s in a garage, a spare bedroom, or 
a rented office. As companies begin to grow, they often need more money 
(known as capital in the financial world) to expand and afford their grow-
ing needs, such as hiring more employees, buying computer systems, and 
purchasing manufacturing equipment. Companies can choose between two 
major money-raising options when they go into the financial markets: issuing 
stocks or issuing bonds.

72
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Deciding whether to issue stocks or bonds
 
A world of difference exists between these two major types of securities, both 
from the perspective of the investor and from that of the issuing company, as 
the following explanations illustrate:
 
 Bonds are loans that a company must pay back. Rather than borrowing 
money from a bank, many companies elect to sell bonds, which are IOUs to 
investors. The primary disadvantage of issuing bonds compared with issu-
ing stock, from a company’s perspective, is that the company must pay this 
money back with interest. On the other hand, the business doesn’t have to 
relinquish ownership when it borrows money. Companies are also more 
likely to issue bonds if the stock market is depressed, meaning that compa-
nies can’t fetch as much for their stock.
 
 Stocks are shares of ownership in a company. Some companies choose 
to issue stock to raise money. Unlike bonds, the money that the company 
raises through a stock issue isn’t paid back, because it’s not a loan. When 
the public (people like you and me) buys stock, these outside investors 
continue to hold and trade it. (Although companies may occasionally 
choose to buy their own stock back, usually because they think it’s a 
good investment, they’re under no obligation to do so. If a company does 
a stock buyback, the price that the company pays is simply the price that 
the stock currently trades for.)
 
 When a company issues stock, doing so allows its founders and owners 
to sell some of their relatively illiquid private stock and reap the 
rewards of their successful company. Many growing companies also 
favor stock issues because they don’t want the cash drain that comes 
from paying loans (bonds) back.
 
 Although many company owners like to take their companies public 
(issuing stock) to cash in on their stake of the company, not all owners 
want to go public, and not all who do go public are happy that they did. 
One of the numerous drawbacks of establishing your company as public 
includes the burdensome financial reporting requirements, such as 
production of quarterly earnings statements and annual reports. These 
documents not only take lots of time and money to produce, but they 
can also reveal competitive secrets. Some companies also harm their 
long-term planning ability because of the pressure and focus on short-
term corporate performance that comes with being a public company.
Ultimately, companies seek to raise capital in the lowest-cost way they can, 
so they’ll elect to sell stocks or bonds based on what the finance folks tell 
them is the cheaper option. For example, if the stock market is booming and 
new stock can sell at a premium price, companies opt to sell more stock.

 Chapter 4: The Workings of Stock and Bond Markets
 
From your perspective as a potential investor, you can usually make more 
money in stocks than bonds, but stocks are generally more volatile in the 
short term (see Chapter 2).
Taking a company public: 
Understanding IPOs
Suppose that The Capitalist Company (TCC) wants to issue stock for the first 
time, which is called an initial public offering (IPO). If TCC decides to go public, 
the company’s management team works with investment bankers, who help 
companies decide when and at what price to sell stock.
Suppose further that based upon their analysis as to the value of TCC, the invest-
ment bankers believe that TCC can raise $20 million by issuing stock, comprising 
a certain portion of the company. When a company issues stock, the price per 
share that the stock is sold for is somewhat arbitrary. The amount that a pro-
spective investor will pay for a particular portion of the company’s stock should 
depend on the company’s profits and future growth prospects. Companies that 
produce higher levels of profits and grow faster can generally command a higher 
sales price for a given portion of the company.
Consider the following ways that investment bankers can structure the IPO 
for TCC:
Price of 
Stock
Number of 
Shares Issued
$5
4 million
$10
2 million
$20
1 million
In fact, TCC can raise $20 million in an infinite number of ways, thanks to 
varying stock prices. If the company wants to issue the stock at a higher 
price, the company sells fewer shares.
 
A stock’s price per share by itself is meaningless in evaluating whether to buy a stock. 
Ultimately, the amount that investors will pay for a company’s stock should 
depend greatly on the company’s growth and profitably prospects.
In the case of TCC, supposing that its stock outstanding in the marketplace 
has a total value of $30 million and that it earned $3 per share in the past 
year, here are the numbers:

In Chapter 5, I talk more about price/earnings ratios and the factors that influ-
ence stock prices.
Understanding Financial 
Markets and Economics
Tens of thousands of books, millions of articles, and enough PhD dissertations 
to pack a major landfill explore the topics of how the financial markets and econ-
omy will perform in the years ahead. You can spend the rest of your life reading 
all this stuff, and you still won’t get through it. In this section, I cut to the chase 
and explain what you need to know about the factors that make the financial 
markets and economy work so you can make informed investing decisions.
Uncovering the roots: Capitalism
In America, we live in a capitalistic (also known as free-market) society. Have 
you ever stopped to think what that term means? Capitalism means that you 
have a tremendous (although not unlimited) amount of economic freedom.
If you want to start your own business, you can. However, that’s not to say 
that you don’t have to deal with obstacles, such as affording the start-up stages 
of your business and dealing with regulatory red tape. Most American entrepre-
neurs tell you that one of their greatest business frustrations is dealing with all 
the various government agencies that regulate and tax business. In addition to 
the long lists of licenses that you need to obtain for certain businesses, you may 
have to deal with zoning and planning offices regarding the use of the location of 
your business. You may also have to work with other state and local agencies if 
you decide to incorporate, and with still more government folks to comply with 
the myriad tax laws of the land.
Whine, whine, whine. Go to a socialist country if you want to see tape that’s 
really red and a lack of economic opportunity and mobility. Socialism, in con-
trast to capitalism, is an economic system that its 19th-century promoters, 
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, best sum up: “Abolish all private property.”
The value of a company's stock
relative to (divided by) its earnings = its price-earnings ratio

 Chapter 4: The Workings of Stock and Bond Markets
Vladimir Lenin transformed the socialist theory of Marx and Engels into a political 
system known as communism. In communism, the government largely controls 
and owns the organizations that provide what people need. Over time, various 
countries in Europe, the former Soviet Union (Russia), and China have tried to 
make communism work. However, most of these parts of the world continue to 
become more capitalistic. The low standard of living in communist countries, long 
waits in lines to purchase goods, and poor health care all contributed to the down-
fall of communist systems. America’s brand of free-market capitalism is spreading 
and contributing to a global economic boom.
Driving stock prices through earnings
The goal of most companies is to make money, or earnings (also called prof-
its). Earnings result from the difference between what a company takes in 
(revenue) and what it spends (costs). I say most companies because some 
organizations’ primary purpose is not to maximize profits. Nonprofit organi-
zations, such as colleges and universities, are a good example. But even non-
profits can’t thrive and prosper without a steady money flow.
Companies that trade publicly on the stock exchanges are supposed to maxi-
mize their profit — that’s what their shareholders want. Higher profits gener-
ally make stock prices rise. Most private companies seek to maximize their 
profits as well, but they retain much more latitude to pursue other goals.
The following are the major ways that successful companies increase profits:
 
 Build a better mousetrap. Some companies develop or promote an 
invention or innovation that better meets customer needs. For example, 
many consumers welcomed the invention of the digital camera that elim-
inated the need for costly and time-consuming development of film. The 
digital camera also made transferring and working with pictures much 
easier. You can turn your pictures into cards and send them via e-mail.
 
 Open new markets to your products. Many successful U.S.-based com-
panies, for example, have been stampeding into foreign countries to sell 
their products. Although some product adaptation is usually required to 
sell overseas, selling an already proven and developed product or service 
to new markets generally increases a company’s chances for success.
 
 Be in related businesses. Consider the hugely successful Walt Disney 
Company, which was started in the 1920s as a small studio that made 
cartoons. Over the years, it expanded into many new but related busi-
nesses, such as theme parks and resorts, movie studios, radio and tele-
vision programs, toys and children’s books, and video games.

76
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
 Build a brand name. Coca-Cola, for example, and many types of well-
known beers rate comparably in blind taste tests to many generic colas 
and beers that are far cheaper. Yet consumers (perhaps you) fork over 
more of their hard-earned loot because of the name and packaging. 
Companies build brand names largely through advertising and other 
promotions. (For Dummies is a brand name, but For Dummies books cost 
about the same as lower-quality and smaller books on similar subjects!)
 
 Manage costs and prices. Smart companies control costs. Lowering the 
cost of manufacturing their products or providing their services allows 
companies to offer their products and services more cheaply. Managing 
costs may help fatten the bottom line (profit). Sometimes, though, com-
panies try to cut too many corners, and their cost-cutting ways come 
back to haunt them in the form of dissatisfied customers — or even law-
suits based on a faulty or dangerous product.
 
 Watch the competition. Successful companies don’t follow the herd, 
but they do keep an eye on what their competition is up to. If lots of 
competitors target one part of the market, some companies target a less-
pursued segment that, if they can capture it, may produce higher profits 
thanks to reduced competition.
Weighing whether markets are efficient
Companies generally seek to maximize profits and maintain a healthy financial 
condition. Ultimately, the financial markets judge the worth of a company’s stock 
or bond. Trying to predict what happens to the stock and bond markets and to 
individual securities consumes many a market prognosticator.
In the 1960s, somewhat to the chagrin of market soothsayers, academic scholars 
developed a theory called the efficient market hypothesis. This theory basically 
maintains the following logic: Lots of investors collect and analyze all sorts of 
information about companies and their securities. If investors think that a secu-
rity, such as a stock, is overpriced, they sell it or don’t buy it. Conversely, if the 
investors believe that a security is underpriced, they buy it or hold what they 
already own. Because of the competition among all these investors, the price 
that a security trades at generally reflects what many (supposedly informed) 
people think it’s worth.
Therefore, the efficient market theory implies that trading in and out of secu-
rities and the overall market in an attempt to obtain the right stocks at the 
right time is a futile endeavor. Buying or selling a security because of “new” 
news is also fruitless because the stock price adjusts so quickly to this news 
that investors can’t profit by acting on it. As Burton Malkiel so eloquently 
said in his classic book A Random Walk Down Wall Street, this theory, “Taken 
to its logical extreme . . . means that a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at 
a newspaper’s financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as 

77
 Chapter 4: The Workings of Stock and Bond Markets
well as one carefully selected by the experts.” Malkiel added, “Financial ana-
lysts in pin-striped suits don’t like being compared with bare-assed apes.”
Some money managers have beaten the markets. In fact, beating the market 
over a year or three years isn’t difficult, but few can beat the market over a 
decade or more. Efficient market supporters argue that some of those who beat 
the markets, even over a ten-year period, do so because of luck. Consider that 
if you flip a coin five times, on some occasions you get five consecutive heads. 
This coincidence actually happens, on average, once every 32 times you do five 
coin-flip sequences because of random luck, not skill. Consistently identifying in 
advance which sequence gives you five consecutive heads isn’t possible.
Strict believers in the efficient market hypothesis say that it’s equally impos-
sible to identify the best money managers in advance. Some money manag-
ers, such as those who manage mutual funds, possess publicly available 
track records. Inspecting those track records (and understanding the level of 
risk taken for the achieved returns) and doing other common-sense things, 
such as investing in funds that have lower expenses, improve your odds of 
performing a bit better than the market.
Various investment markets differ in how efficient they are. Efficiency means 
that the current price of an investment accurately reflects its true value. Although 
the stock market is reasonably efficient, many consider the bond market to be 
even more efficient. The real estate market is less efficient because properties 
are unique, and sometimes less competition and access to information exist. If 
you can locate a seller who really needs to sell, you may be able to buy property 
at a discount from what it’s really worth. Small business is also less efficient. 
Entrepreneurs with innovative ideas and approaches can sometimes earn 
enormous returns.
Moving the market: Interest rates, 
inflation, and the Federal Reserve
For decades, economists, investment managers, and other (often self-anointed) 
gurus have attempted to understand the course of interest rates, inflation, and 
the monetary policies set forth by the Federal Reserve. Millions of investors 
follow these economic factors. Why? Because interest rates, inflation, and the 
Federal Reserve’s monetary policies seem to move the financial markets and 
the economy.
Realizing that high interest rates are generally bad
Many businesses borrow money to expand. People like you and me, who are 
affectionately referred to as consumers, also borrow money to finance home 
and auto purchases and education.

78
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Interest rate increases tend to slow the economy. Businesses scale back on 
expansion plans, and some debt-laden businesses can’t afford high interest 
rates and go under. Most individuals possess limited budgets as well and 
have to scale back some purchases because of higher interest rates. For 
example, higher interest rates translate into higher mortgage payments for 
home buyers.
If high interest rates choke business expansion and consumer spending, 
economic growth slows, or the economy shrinks — and possibly ends up 
in a recession. The definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters (six 
months) of contracting economic activity.
The stock market usually develops a case of the queasies as corporate profits 
shrink. High interest rates may depress investors’ appetites for stocks as the 
yields increase on certificates of deposit (CDs), Treasury bills, and other bonds.
Higher interest rates actually make some people happy. If you locked in a 
fixed-rate mortgage on your home or on a business loan, your loan looks 
much better than if you had a variable-rate mortgage. Some retirees and 
others who live off the interest income on their investments are happy with 
interest rate increases as well. Consider back in the early 1980s, for example, 
when a retiree received $10,000 per year in interest for each $100,000 that he 
invested in certificates of deposit that paid 10 percent.
Fast-forward to the early 2000s: A retiree purchasing the same CDs saw interest 
income slashed by about 70 percent, because rates on the CDs were just 3 per-
cent. So for every $100,000 invested, only $3,000 in interest income was paid.
If you try to live off the income that your investments produce, a 70 percent 
drop in that income is likely to cramp your lifestyle. So higher interest rates 
are better if you’re living off your investment income, right? Not necessarily.
Discovering the inflation and interest rate connection
Consider what happened to interest rates in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
After the United States successfully emerged from a terrible recession in the 
mid-1970s, the economy seemed to be on the right track. But within just a few 
years, the economy was in turmoil again. The annual increase in the cost of 
living (known as the rate of inflation) burst through 10 percent on its way to 14 
percent. Interest rates, which are what bondholders receive when they lend 
their money to corporations and governments, followed inflation skyward.
 
Inflation and interest rates usually move in tandem. The primary driver of 
interest rates is the rate of inflation. Interest rates were much higher in the 
1980s because the United States had double-digit inflation. If the cost of living 
increases at the rate of 10 percent per year, why would you, as an investor, 
lend your money (which is what you do when you purchase a bond or CD) at 5 
percent? Interest rates were so much higher in the early 1980s because you or 
I would never do such a thing.

79
 Chapter 4: The Workings of Stock and Bond Markets
In recent years, interest rates have been low because inflation has declined 
significantly since the early 1980s. Therefore, the rate of interest that inves-
tors could earn lending their money dropped accordingly. Although low 
interest rates reduce the interest income that comes in, the corresponding 
low rate of inflation doesn’t devour the purchasing power of your principal 
balance. That’s why lower interest rates aren’t necessarily worse and higher 
interest rates aren’t necessarily better as you try to live off your investment 
income.
So what’s an investor to do when he’s living off the income he receives from 
his investments but doesn’t receive enough because of low interest rates? 
Some retirees have woken up to the risk of keeping all or too much of their 
money in short-term CD and bond investments. (Please review the sections 
in Chapter 3 dealing with asset allocation and investment mix.) A simple 
but psychologically difficult solution is to use up some of your principal to 
supplement your interest and dividend income. Using up your principal to 
supplement your income is what effectively happens anyway when inflation 
is higher — the purchasing power of your principal erodes more quickly. You 
may also find that you haven’t saved enough money to meet your desired 
standard of living — that’s why you may want to run a retirement analysis 
(see Chapter 3) before you retire.
Exploring the role of the Federal Reserve
When the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Ben Bernanke, speaks, 
an extraordinary number of people listen. Most financial market watchers 
and the media want to know what the Federal Reserve has decided to do 
about monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United 
States. The Federal Reserve Board is comprised of the 12 presidents from 
the respective Federal Reserve district banks and the 7 Federal Reserve 
governors, including the chairman who conducts the Federal Open Market 
Committee meetings behind closed doors eight times a year.
What exactly is the Fed, as it’s known, and what does it do? The Federal Reserve 
sets monetary policy. In other (perhaps clearer) words, the Fed influences inter-
est rates levels and the amount of money or currency in circulation, known as 
the money supply, in an attempt to maintain a stable rate of inflation and growth 
in the U.S. economy.
Buying money is no different from buying lettuce, computers, or sneakers. 
All these products and goods cost you dollars when you buy them. The cost 
of money is the interest rate that you must pay to borrow it. And the cost or 
interest rate of money is determined by many factors that ultimately influ-
ence the supply of and demand for money.
The Fed, from time to time and in different ways, attempts to influence the 
supply and demand for money and the cost of money. To this end, the Fed 
raises or lowers short-term interest rates, primarily by buying and selling 
U.S. Treasury bills on the open market. Through this trading activity, known 

80
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
as open market operations, the Fed is able to target the Federal funds rate — 
the rate at which banks borrow from one another overnight.
The senior officials at the Fed readily admit that the economy is quite 
complex and affected by many things, so it’s difficult to predict where the 
economy is heading. If forecasting and influencing markets are such difficult 
undertakings, why does the Fed exist? Well, the Fed officials believe that they 
can have a positive influence in creating a healthy overall economic environ-
ment — one in which inflation is low and growth proceeds at a modest pace.
 
Over the years, the Fed has come under attack for various reasons. Various 
pundits have accused former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan of causing specu-
lative bubbles (see Chapter 5), such as the boom in technology stock prices in 
the late 1990s or in housing in the early 2000s. Some economists have argued 
that the Federal Reserve has, with a nudge of encouragement from the president, 
goosed the economy. The Fed gooses the economy by loosening up on the 
money supply, which leads to a growth spurt in the economy and a booming 
stock market, just in time to make El Presidente look good prior to an election. 
Conveniently, the consequences of inflation take longer to show up — not until 
after the election. In recent years, others have questioned the Fed’s ability to 
largely do what it wants without accountability.
 
Many factors influence the course of stock prices. Never, ever make a trade 
or investment based upon what someone at the Federal Reserve says or what 
someone in the media or some market pundit reads into the Fed chairman’s 
comments. You need to make your investment plans based on your needs and 
goals, not what the Fed does or doesn’t do.

S
ome people liken investing in the stock market to gambling. A real casino 
structures its games — slot machines, blackjack, roulette, and so on — so 
that in aggregate, the casino owners siphon off a healthy slab (40 percent) of 
the money that people bring with them. The vast majority of casino patrons 
lose money, in some cases all of it. The few who leave with more money than 
they came with are usually people who are lucky and are smart enough to quit 
while they’re ahead.
I can understand why some individual investors feel that the stock market 
resembles legalized gambling. So why bother with the stock market if it’s so 
confusing and filled with people who are eager to separate you from your 
money? In Chapter 2, I discuss the potential risks and rewards of different 
investments. Shares of stock, which represent portions of ownership in com-
panies, offer a way for people of modest and wealthy means, and everybody 
in between, to invest in companies and build wealth.
Fortunately, the stock market isn’t a casino — far from it. History shows that 
nearly all long-term investors can win in the stock market because it appre-
ciates over the years. I say nearly because even some people who remain 
active in the market over many years manage to lose some money because of 
easily avoidable mistakes, which I can keep you from making in the future.
R. Foster Winans, a former writer for Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal, said, 
“The only reason to invest in the market is because you think you know some-
thing others don’t.” Mr. Winans, who was later convicted of insider trading, was

wrong in more ways than one. You don’t need inside information to profit 
from stock investments. You simply need to understand this basic concept: 
The increasing profits that expanding companies produce ultimately propel 
stock prices higher. The trajectory path isn’t a straight line up, but more like 
the path that a small bird takes when it fights to gain altitude in a headwind. 
Although the bird sometimes hits an air pocket or spot of bad weather and 
loses some altitude, the bird’s aerodynamics win out. How many birds have 
you seen crash to the ground?
The same theory applies with corporate profits. Corporate profits also tend 
to trend up, but sometimes the economy hits a bad patch, and profits fall. As 
with the bird, economies don’t usually get completely decimated. Yes, it’s 
possible that if a huge meteor smashes into Earth or a horrible, contagious 
virus spreads like wildfire, society may be done for — people and companies 
may cease to exist and make a profit. In the meantime, why not share in the 
expansion of the economy and keep an optimistic view on life?
Taking Stock of How You Make Money
 
When you purchase a share of a company’s stock, you can profit from your 
ownership in two ways:
 
 Dividends: Most stocks pay dividends. Companies ideally make some 
profits during the year. Some high-growth companies reinvest most or all 
of their profits right back into the business. Many companies, however, 
pay out some of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends.
 
 Appreciation: When the price per share of your stock rises to a level 
greater than you originally paid for it, you make money. This profit, how-
ever, is only on paper until you sell the stock, at which time you realize a 
capital gain. Of course, the stock price per share can fall below what you 
originally paid (in which case you have a loss on paper unless you realize 
that loss by selling at a lower price than you paid for the stock).
If you add together dividends and appreciation, you arrive at your total return. 
Stocks differ in the dimensions of these possible returns, particularly with 
respect to dividends. Utility companies, for example, tend to pay out more of 
their profits as dividends. But don’t buy utility stocks thinking that you’ll make 
more money because of the heftier dividends. Utilities and other companies 
paying high dividends tend not to appreciate as much over time because they 
don’t reinvest as much in their businesses, and they’re not growing.

 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Defining “The Market”
So you invest in stocks to share in the rewards of capitalistic economies. 
When you invest in stocks, you do so through the stock market. What is the 
stock market? Everybody talks about “The Market” the same way they do the 
largest city nearby (“The City”):
The Market is down 137 points today.
With The Market hitting new highs, isn’t now a bad time to invest?
The Market seems ready for a fall.
When people talk about The Market, they’re usually referring to the U.S. 
stock market. Even more specifically, they’re speaking about the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average, created by Charles Dow and Eddie Jones, which 
is a famously known index or measure of the performance of the U.S. stock 
market. Dow and Jones, two reporters in their 30s, started publishing a paper 
that you may have heard of — The Wall Street Journal — in 1889. Like its 
modern-day version, the 19th-century Wall Street Journal reported current 
financial news. Dow and Jones also compiled stock prices of larger, important 
companies and created and calculated indexes to track the performance of 
the U.S. stock market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) market index tracks the perfor-
mance of 30 large companies that are headquartered in the United States. 
The Dow 30 includes companies such as telecommunications giant Verizon 
Communications; airplane manufacturer Boeing; beverage maker Coca-Cola; 
oil giant Exxon Mobil; automaker General Motors; technology behemoths 
IBM, Intel, and Microsoft; drug makers Merck and Pfizer; fast-food king 
McDonald’s; and retailers Home Depot and Wal-Mart.
Some criticize the Dow index for encompassing so few companies and for a 
lack of diversity. The 30 stocks that make up the Dow aren’t the 30 largest or 
the 30 best companies in America. They just so happen to be the 30 companies 
that senior staff members at The Wall Street Journal think reflect the diversity 
of the economy in the United States (although utility and transportation stocks 
are excluded and tracked in other Dow indexes). The 30 stocks in the Dow 
change over time as companies merge, decline, and rise in importance.
Looking at major stock market indexes
Just as New York City isn’t the only city to visit or live in, the 30 stocks in the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average are far from representative of all the different 
types of stocks that you can invest in. Here are some other important market 
indexes and the types of stocks they track:

84
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
 Standard & Poor’s 500: Like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 
500 tracks the price of 500 larger-company U.S. stocks. These 500 big com-
panies account for more than 70 percent of the total market value of the 
tens of thousands of stocks traded in the United States. Thus, the S&P 500 
is a much broader and more representative index of the larger-company 
stocks in the United States than is the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
 
 Unlike the Dow index, which is primarily calculated by adding the current 
share price of each of its component stocks, the S&P 500 index is calculated 
by adding the total market value (capitalization) of its component stocks.
 
 Russell 2000: This index tracks the market value of 2,000 smaller U.S. 
company stocks of various industries. Although small-company stocks 
tend to move in tandem with larger-company stocks over the longer term, 
it’s not unusual for one to rise or fall more than the other or for one index 
to fall while the other rises in a given year. For example, in 2001, the Russell 
2000 actually rose 2.5 percent while the S&P 500 fell 11.9 percent. In 2007, 
the Russell 2000 lost 1.6 percent versus a gain of 5.5 percent for the S&P 
500. Be aware that smaller-company stocks tend to be more volatile (I 
discuss this in more detail in Chapter 2).
 
 Wilshire 5000: Despite its name, the Wilshire 5000 index actually tracks 
the prices of more than 6,500 stocks of U.S. companies of all sizes — 
small, medium, and large. Thus, many consider this index the broadest 
and most representative of the overall U.S. stock market.
 
 Morgan Stanley EAFE: Stocks don’t exist only in the United States. 
Morgan Stanley’s EAFE index (EAFE stands for Europe, Australasia, and 
Far East) tracks the prices of stocks in the other major developed coun-
tries of the world.
 
 Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets: This index follows the value of 
stocks in the less economically developed but “emerging” countries 
such as Korea, Brazil, China, Russia, Taiwan, India, South Africa, Mexico, 
and so on. These stock markets tend to be more volatile than those in 
established economies. During good economic times, emerging markets 
usually reward investors with higher returns, but stocks can fall farther 
and faster than stocks in developed markets.
 
Conspicuously absent from this list of major stock market indexes is the 
NASDAQ index. With the boom in technology stock prices in the late 1990s, 
CNBC and other financial media started broadcasting movements in the 
technology-laden NASDAQ index, thereby increasing investor interest and the 
frenzy surrounding technology stocks. (See the section later in this chapter 
titled “The Internet and technology bubble.”) I’m not a fan of sector (industry) 
specific investing; it undermines diversification and places you in the role of 
a professional money manager in having to determine when and how much to 
invest in specific industry groups. I suggest ignoring the NASDAQ as well as 
other industry-concentrated indexes.

 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Counting reasons to use indexes
 
Indexes serve several purposes. First, they can quickly give you an idea of how 
particular types of stocks fare and perform in comparison with other types of 
stocks. In 1998, for example, the S&P 500 was up 28.6 percent, whereas the 
small-company Russell 2000 index was down 2.5 percent. That same year, the 
Morgan Stanley foreign stock EAFE index rose 20.3 percent. In 2001, by con-
trast, the S&P 500 fell 11.9 percent, and the EAFE foreign stock index had an 
even worse year — falling 21.4 percent.
Indexes also allow you to compare or benchmark the performance of your 
stock market investments. If you invest primarily in large-company U.S. stocks, 
for example, you should compare the overall return of the stocks in your 
Recognizing bull and bear markets
If you read magazines or newspapers or listen 
to people talk about the stock market, you often 
hear references to bull markets and bear mar-
kets. You may know which term means a good 
market and which term means a bad market for 
investors, but even if you do, you may wonder 
where these silly terms came from.
It’s hard to find agreement on the origin of these 
terms, but my favorite description comes from 
Robert Claiborne’s Loose Cannons and Red 
Herrings — A Book of Lost Metaphors. The 
term bear, according to Claiborne, originates 
from a proverb that mocks a man who “sells 
the bearskin before catching the bear.” This is 
the connection to the stock market: When deal-
ers in the stock market thought that the market 
became too pricey and speculative, these deal-
ers sold stock that they hadn’t yet “caught” 
(bought). These dealers were labeled “bearskin 
jobbers” and, later, “bears.”
The practice that these bearish dealers 
engaged in is short selling. They hoped that 
when they ultimately bought the stock that they 
had first sold, they could buy it back at a lower 
price. Their profit was the difference between 
the price that they originally sold it for and what 
they later bought it for. Short selling is simply 
investing in reverse: You sell first and buy back 
later. The worst situation for a bear is if prices 
go up, and she must buy back the stock at a high 
price. As Claiborne said, “He who sells what 
isn’t his’n, must buy it back or go to prison.”
The bulls, according to Claiborne, are those 
who work the “other side” of the street. Bulls 
buy stocks with the hope and expectation that 
they will rise in value. Ben Travato, a man 
whom Claiborne describes as one prone to 
inventing colorful, but often inaccurate, ety-
mologies, said that bulls toss stocks up in the 
air with their horns.
An alternative explanation for these terms 
comes from research that economic and invest-
ment strategist Don Luskin shared with me. He 
says that the terms were in use in the early 
1700s in the financial markets in England, and 
that they derive from the staged fights between 
wild animals that were offered as cruel public 
amusements at the time. When bulls were 
pitted against bears, the bull fought with an 
upward motion of its horns; the bear fought with 
a downward motion of its paws.

portfolio to a comparable index — in this case, the S&P 500. (As I discuss in 
Chapter 8, index mutual funds, which invest to match a major stock market 
index, offer a cost-effective, proven way to build wealth by investing in stocks.)
As I explain in the section “Looking at major stock market indexes,” earlier 
in this chapter, you may also hear about some other types of more narrowly 
focused indexes, including those that track the performance of stocks in par-
ticular industries, such as advertising, banking, computers, pharmaceuticals, 
restaurants, semiconductors, textiles, and utilities. Other indexes cover other 
countries’ stock markets, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, 
Canada, and Hong Kong. Focusing on your investments in the stocks of just one 
or two industries or smaller countries is dangerous due to the lack of diversi-
fication and your lack of expertise in making the difficult decision about what 
and when to invest in. Thus, I suggest that you ignore these narrower indexes. 
Many companies, largely out of desire for publicity, develop their own indexes. 
If the news media report on these indexes, the index developer effectively 
obtains free advertising. (In Chapter 8, I discuss investing strategies, such as 
those that focus on value stocks or growth stocks, which also have market 
indexes.)
Stock-Buying Methods
When it comes to investing in stocks, many (perhaps too many) choices 
exist. Besides the tens of thousands of stocks among which you can select, 
you can hire a mutual fund manager, invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 
or hedge funds, or have a stockbroker select for you.
Buying stocks via mutual funds
If you’re busy and suffer no delusions about your expertise, you’ll love the best 
stock mutual funds. Investing in stocks through mutual funds can be as simple 
as dialing a toll-free phone number or logging on to a fund company’s Web site, 
completing some application forms, and zapping them some money.
Mutual funds take money invested by people like you and me and pool that 
money in a single investment portfolio in securities, such as stocks and 
bonds, that is professionally managed. Stock mutual funds, as the name sug-
gests, invest primarily or exclusively in stocks (some “stock” funds some-
times invest a bit in other stuff, such as bonds).
 
Stock mutual funds include many advantages:
 
 Diversification: Buying individual stocks on your own is relatively costly 
unless you buy reasonable chunks (100 shares or so) of each stock. But 
in order to buy 100 shares each in, say, a dozen companies’ stocks to 

87
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
ensure diversification, you need about $60,000 if the stocks that you buy 
average $50 per share.
 
 Professional management: Even if you have big bucks to invest, mutual 
funds offer something that you can’t deliver: professional, full-time manage-
ment. Mutual fund managers peruse a company’s financial statements and 
otherwise track and analyze a company’s business strategy and market 
position. The best managers put in long hours and possess lots of expertise 
and experience in the field. (If you’ve been misled into believing that with 
minimal effort you can rack up market-beating returns by selecting your 
own stocks, please be sure to read the rest of this chapter.)
 
 Look at it this way: Mutual funds are a huge time-saver. It’s Friday night — 
would you rather sit in front of your computer or go to the local library and 
do some research on semiconductor and toilet paper manufacturers, or 
enjoy dinner or a movie with family and friends? (I guess that the answer to 
that question depends on who your family and friends are!)
 
 Low costs — if you pick ’em right: To convince you that mutual funds 
aren’t a good way for you to invest, those with a vested interest, such as 
stock-picking newsletter pundits, may point out the high fees that some 
funds charge. An element of truth rings here: Some funds are expensive, 
charging you a couple percent or more per year in operating expenses 
on top of hefty sales commissions.
 
 But just as you wouldn’t want to invest in a fund that a novice with no 
track record manages, why would you want to invest in a high-cost fund? 
Contrary to the “You get what you pay for” notion often trumpeted by 
those trying to sell you something at an inflated price, some of the best 
managers are the cheapest to hire. Through a no-load (commission-free) 
mutual fund, you can hire a professional, full-time money manager to 
invest your $10,000 for a mere $20 to $100 per year. And if you have far 
less than this to invest, they’ll still invest your money at a low cost: $2 to 
$10 per year if you invest $1,000.
 
As with all investments, mutual funds have drawbacks.
 
 The issue of control is a problem for some investors. If you’re a contro-
laholic, turning over your investment dollars to a seemingly black-box 
process where others decide when and in what to invest your money may 
unnerve you. However, you need to be more concerned about the poten-
tial blunders that you may make investing in individual stocks of your own 
choosing or, even worse, those stocks pitched to you by a broker.
 
 Taxes are another concern when you invest in mutual funds outside 
retirement accounts. Because the fund manager, and not you, decides 
when to sell specific stock holdings, some funds may produce relatively 
high levels of taxable distributions. Fear not — simply select tax-friendly 
funds if taxes concern you.
In Chapter 8, I discuss investing in the best mutual funds that offer a time- 
and cost-efficient, high-quality way to invest in stocks worldwide.

88
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Using exchange-traded 
funds and hedge funds
Exchange-trade funds (ETFs) are the new kid on the block, certainly in com-
parison to mutual funds. ETFs are similar to mutual funds, specifically index 
funds (see Chapter 8), in many ways, except that they trade on a stock exchange. 
The chief attraction are those ETFs that offer investors the potential for even 
lower operating expenses than comparable mutual funds. I expand on ETFs and 
explain which ones to consider using in Chapter 8.
Like mutual funds, hedge funds are a managed investment vehicle. However, 
hedge funds are oriented to affluent investors and typically charge steep fees — 
a 1.0 to 1.5 percent annual management fee plus a 20 percent cut of the annual 
fund returns. There’s no proof that hedge funds as a group perform any better 
than mutual funds. In fact, the objective studies that I’ve reviewed show inferior 
hedge fund returns, which makes sense. Those high hedge fund fees depress 
their returns.
Selecting individual stocks
More than a few investing books suggest and enthusiastically encourage 
people like you to do their own stock picking. However, the vast majority of 
people are better off not picking their own stocks.
I’ve long been an advocate of people educating themselves and taking 
responsibility for their own financial affairs, but taking responsibility for your 
own finances doesn’t mean that you should do everything yourself. Table 5-1 
includes some thoughts to consider about choosing your own stocks.
Table 5-1 
The Pros and Cons of Buying Your Own Stocks
Good Reasons to Pick 
Your Own Stocks
Bad Reasons to Pick Your Own Stocks
You enjoy the challenge.
You think you can beat the best money managers. 
(If you can, you’re in the wrong profession!)
You want to learn more 
about business.
You want more control over your investments, 
which you think may happen if you understand 
the companies that you invest in.
You possess a substantial 
amount of money to invest.
You think that mutual funds are for people who 
aren’t smart enough to choose their own stocks.
You’re a buy-and-hold 
investor.
You’re attracted to the ability to trade your stocks 
any time you want.

89
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Some popular investing books try to convince investors that they can do a 
better job than the professionals at picking their own stocks. Amateur inves-
tors, however, need to devote a lot of study to become proficient at stock 
selection. Many professional investors work 80 hours a week at investing, but 
it’s unlikely that you’re willing to spend that much time on it. Don’t let the 
popularity of those do-it-yourself stock-picking books lead you astray.
 
Choosing a stock isn’t as simple as visiting a restaurant chain (or buying a pair 
of shoes or an iGadget), liking it, buying its stock, and then sitting back and 
getting rich watching your stock zoom to the moon.
If you invest in stocks, I think you know by now that guarantees don’t exist. 
But as in many of life’s endeavors, you can buy individual stocks in good 
and not-so-good ways. In Chapter 6, I explain how to research and trade indi-
vidual stocks.
Spotting the Best Times to Buy and Sell
Now that you know about the different types of stock markets and ways to 
invest in stocks, you may wonder how you can build wealth with stocks and 
not lose your shirt. Nobody wants to buy stocks before the markets take a big 
drop (which I discuss in Chapter 2). Thousands of books have been written 
about how to get rich in the stock market by buying the best stocks cheaply 
and selling them when they become expensive.
As I discuss in Chapter 4, the stock market is reasonably efficient. A com-
pany’s stock price normally reflects many smart people’s assessments as to 
what is a fair price. Thus, it’s not realistic for an investor to expect to dis-
cover a system for how to “buy low and sell high.”
A few rare professional investors may obtain an ability for spotting good 
times to buy and sell particular stocks, but consistently doing so is enor-
mously difficult. In fact, the investing public doesn’t possess a great track 
record with buying low and selling high. Smaller investors tend to sell heavily 
after major declines and step up buying after major price increases.
 
The simplest and best way to make money in the stock market is to consistently 
and regularly feed new money into building a diversified and larger portfolio. If 
the market drops, you can use your new investment dollars to buy more shares. 
The danger of trying to time the market is that you may be “out” of the market 
when it appreciates greatly and “in” the market when it plummets.

Calculating price/earnings ratios
Suppose I tell you that Liz’s Distinctive Jewelry’s stock sells for $50 per share, 
and another stock in the same industry, The Jazzy Jeweler, sells for $100. 
Which would you rather buy?
If you answer, “I don’t have a clue because you didn’t give me enough infor-
mation,” go to the head of the class! On its own, the price per share of stock 
is meaningless.
Although The Jazzy Jeweler sells for twice as much per share, its profits might 
also be twice as much per share — in which case, The Jazzy Jeweler stock 
price may not be out of line given its profitability. The level of a company’s 
stock price relative to its earnings or profits per share helps you calibrate how 
expensively, cheaply, or fairly a stock price is valued.
Over the long term, stock prices and corporate profits tend to move in sync, 
like good dance partners. The price/earnings (P/E) ratio (say “P E” — the “/” 
isn’t pronounced) compares the level of stock prices to the level of corporate 
profits, giving you a good sense of the stock’s value. Over shorter periods 
of time, investors’ emotions as well as fundamentals move stocks, but over 
longer terms, fundamentals possess a far greater influence on stock prices.
P/E ratios can be calculated for individual stocks as well as entire stock 
indexes, portfolios, or funds. Use this practical example to see how you can 
apply the use of P/E ratios.
A particular price level in and of itself is meaningless, like a given stock (such 
as IBM) that rises above a specific price (such as $100 per share). The level 
of a stock’s price, or a stock market index, is important and meaningful when 
you compare it with earnings for the company or companies in the stock 
market index.
Over the past 100-plus years, the P/E ratio of U.S. stocks has averaged around 
15. During times of low inflation, the ratio has tended to be higher — in 
the high teens to low twenties. As I cautioned in the second edition of this 
book, published in 1999, the P/E ratio for U.S. stocks got into the thirties, 
well above historic norms even for a period of low inflation. Thus, the down 
market that began in 2000 wasn’t surprising, especially given the fall in corpo-
rate profits that put even more pressure on stock prices.
Just because U.S. stocks have historically averaged P/E ratios of about 15 
doesn’t mean that every individual stock will trade at such a P/E. Here’s why: 
Suppose that you have a choice between investing in two companies, Superb 
Stock Price Per Share
Annual Earnings Per Share
= Price-earnings (P/E) ratio

91
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Software, which makes computer software, and Tortoise Technologies, which 
makes typewriters. If both companies’ stocks sell at a P/E of 15 and Superb 
Software’s business and profits grow 40 percent per year and Tortoise’s busi-
ness and profits remain flat, which would you buy?
Because both stocks trade at a P/E of 15, Superb Software appears to be the 
better buy. Even if Superb’s stock continues to sell at 15 times the earnings, 
its stock price should increase 40 percent per year as its profits increase. 
Faster-growing companies usually command higher price/earnings ratios.
 
Just because a stock price or an entire stock market seems to be at a high price 
level doesn’t necessarily mean that the stock or market is overpriced. Always 
compare the price of a stock to that company’s profits per share or the over-
all market’s price level to overall corporate profits. The price/earnings ratio 
captures this comparison. Faster-growing and more-profitable companies gen-
erally sell for a premium — higher P/E ratios. Also remember that future earn-
ings, which are difficult to predict, influence stock prices more than current 
earnings, which are old news.
Citing times of speculative excess
Because the financial markets move on the financial realities of the economy 
as well as people’s expectations and emotions (particularly fear and greed), 
I don’t believe that you should try to time the markets. Knowing when to buy 
and sell is much harder than you think.
 
Be careful that you don’t get sucked into investing lots of your money in 
aggressive investments that seem to be in a hyped state. In fact, many people 
don’t become aware of an investment until it receives lots of attention. By the 
time everyone else talks about an investment, it’s often nearing or at its peak. 
In the sections that follow, I walk you through some of the biggest speculative 
bubbles. Although some of these examples are from prior decades and even 
centuries, I chose these examples because I find that they best teach the warn-
ing signs and dangers of speculative fever times.
The Internet and technology bubble
Note: This first section is reproduced here verbatim as it appeared in the second 
edition of this book, published in 1999, which turned out to be just one year 
before the tech bubble actually burst.
Unless you isolate yourself from what we call civilization, you’ve surely heard 
about the explosive growth in the Internet. In the mid-1990s, a number of 
Internet-based companies launched initial public offerings of stock. (I discuss 
IPOs in Chapter 4.) Most of the early Internet company stock offerings failed 
to really catch fire. By the late 1990s, however, some of these stocks began 
meteoric rises.

92
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
The bigger-name Internet stocks included companies such as Internet service 
provider America Online, bookseller and online retailer Amazon.com, Internet 
auctioneer eBay, and Internet portal Yahoo!. As with the leading new consumer 
product manufacturers of the 1920s that I discuss in the section “The 1920s 
consumer spending binge,” later in this chapter, many of the leading Internet 
company stocks zoomed to the moon. Please note that the absolute stock 
price per share of the leading Internet companies in the late 1990s was mean-
ingless. The P/E ratio is what mattered. Valuing the Internet stocks based upon 
earnings posed a challenge because many of these Internet companies were 
losing money or just beginning to make money. Some Wall Street analysts, 
therefore, valued Internet stocks based upon revenue and not profits.
 
Valuing a stock based upon revenue and not profits can be highly dangerous. 
Revenues don’t necessarily translate into high profits or any profits at all.
In the case of Amazon.com, its stock price soared in early 1999 to $221 per 
share, which gave the company’s stock a total market valuation in excess 
of $35 billion, or more than 12 times that of competing bookseller Barnes & 
Noble. B&N had prior year sales of nearly $3 billion compared with Amazon.
com’s approximate $400 million sales as it was losing money! At its low in 
2001, Amazon’s market value had fallen nearly 95 percent to less than $2 bil-
lion, very nearly the same valuation that Barnes & Noble had at that time.
Now, Amazon.com and other current leading Internet companies may go 
on to become some of the great companies and stocks of future decades. 
However, consider this perspective from veteran money manager David 
Dreman. “The Internet stocks are getting hundredfold more attention from 
investors than, say, a Ford Motor in chat rooms online and elsewhere. People 
are fascinated with the Internet — many individual investors have accounts 
on margin. Back in the early 1900s, there were hundreds of auto manufactur-
ers, and it was hard to know who the long-term survivors would be. The cur-
rent leaders won’t probably be long-term winners.”
Internet stocks aren’t the only stocks being swept to excessive prices rela-
tive to their earnings at the dawn of the new millennium. Various traditional 
retailers announced the opening of Internet sites to sell their goods, and 
within days, their stock prices doubled or tripled. Also, leading name-brand 
technology companies, such as Dell Computer, Cisco Systems, Lucent, and 
PeopleSoft, traded at P/E ratios in excess of 100. Investment brokerage firm 
Charles Schwab, which expanded to offer Internet services, saw its stock 
price balloon to push its P/E ratio over 100. As during the 1960s and 1920s, 
name-brand growth companies soared to high P/E valuations. For example, 
coffee purveyor Starbucks at times had a P/E near 100.
 
What I find troubling about investors piling in to the leading, name-brand stocks, 
especially in Internet and technology-related fields, is that many of these inves-
tors don’t even know what a price/earnings ratio is and why it’s important. 
Before you invest in any individual stock, no matter how great a company you 
think it is, you need to understand the company’s line of business, strategies, 

93
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
competitors, financial statements, and price/earnings ratio versus the com-
petition, among many other issues. Selecting and monitoring good companies 
take lots of research, time, and discipline.
Also, remember that if a company taps in to a product line or way of doing 
business that proves highly successful, that company’s success invites lots 
of competition. So you need to understand the barriers to entry that a lead-
ing company has erected and how difficult or easy it is for competitors to 
join the fray. Also, be wary of analysts’ predictions about earnings and stock 
prices. As more and more investment banking analysts initiated coverage of 
Internet companies and issued buy ratings on said stocks, investors bought 
more shares. Analysts, who are too optimistic (as shown in numerous inde-
pendent studies), have a conflict of interest because the investment banks 
that they work for seek to cultivate the business (new stock and bond issues) 
of the companies that they purport to rate and analyze. The analysts who 
say, “buy, buy, buy all the current market leaders” are the same analysts who 
generate much new business for their investment banks and get the lucrative 
job offers and multimillion-dollar annual salaries.
 
Simply buying today’s rising and analyst-recommended stocks often leads 
to future disappointment. If the company’s growth slows or the profits don’t 
materialize as expected, the underlying stock price can nose dive. This hap-
pened to investors who piled in to the stock of computer disk drive maker 
Iomega back in early 1996. After a spectacular rise to about $27 ½ per share, 
the company fell on tough times. Iomega stock subsequently plunged to less 
than $3 per share. This stock probably won’t recover to its early 1996 price 
levels for many more years.
Presstek, a company that uses computer technology for direct imaging systems, 
rose from less than $10 per share in mid-1994 to nearly $100 per share just two 
years later — another example of supposed can’t-lose technology that crashed 
and burned. As was the case with Iomega, herds of novice investors jumped 
on the Presstek bandwagon simply because they believed that the stock price 
would keep rising. By 1999, less than three years after hitting nearly $100 per 
share, it plunged more than 90 percent to about $5 per share. It’s been recently 
trading under $10 per share.
ATC Communications, which was similar to Iomega and glowingly recom-
mended by the Motley Fool Web site, plunged by more than 80 percent in a 
matter of months before the Fools recommended selling.
The Japanese stock market juggernaut
Lest you think that the United States cornered the market on manias, over-
seas examples abound. A rather extraordinary mania happened not so long 
ago in the Japanese stock market.
After Japan’s crushing defeat in World War II, its economy was in shambles. 
Two major cities — Hiroshima and Nagasaki — were destroyed, and more 
than 200,000 died when the United States dropped atomic bombs.

94
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Out of the rubble, Japan emerged a strengthened nation that became an eco-
nomic powerhouse. Over the course of 22 years, from 1967 to 1989, Japanese 
stock prices rose an amazing 30-fold (3,000 percent) as the economy boomed. 
From 1983 to 1989 alone, Japanese stocks soared more than 500 percent.
In terms of the U.S. dollar, the Japanese stock market rise was all the more 
stunning, as the dollar lost value versus Japan’s currency, the yen. The dollar 
lost about 65 percent of its value during the big run-up in Japanese stocks. 
In dollar terms, the Japanese stock market rose an astonishing 8,300 percent 
from 1967 to 1989.
 
Many considered investing in Japanese stocks close to a sure thing. Increasing 
numbers of people became full-time stock market investors in Japan. Many of 
these folks were actually speculators because they relied heavily on borrowed 
funds. As the Japanese real estate market boomed in tandem with the stock 
market, real estate investors borrowed from their winnings to invest in stocks 
and vice versa.
Borrowing heavily was easy to do; Japan’s banks were awash in cash, and it 
was cheap, cheap, cheap to borrow. Investors could borrow money for an 
interest rate of a mere few percent. “Established investors” could make prop-
erty purchases with no money down. Cash abounded from real estate as the 
price of land in Tokyo, for example, soared 500 percent from 1985 to 1990. 
Despite the fact that Japan has only 1/25 as much land as the United States, 
Japan’s total land values at the close of the 1980s were four times that of all 
the land in the United States.
Speculators also used futures and options (discussed in Chapter 1) to gamble 
on higher short-term Japanese stock market prices. (Interestingly, Japan 
doesn’t allow selling short.)
Price/earnings ratios? Forget about it. To justify the high prices that they 
paid for stocks, Japanese market speculators pointed out that the real estate 
that many companies owned was soaring to the moon and making companies 
more valuable.
Price/earnings ratios on the Japanese market soared during the early 1980s and 
ballooned to more than 60 times earnings by 1987. As I point out elsewhere in 
this chapter, such lofty P/E ratios were sometimes awarded beloved stocks in 
the United States. But the entire Japanese stock market, which included many 
mediocre and not-so-hot companies, possessed P/E ratios of 60-plus!
When Japan’s Nippon Telegraph and Telephone went public in February 1987, 
it met such frenzied enthusiasm that its stock price was soon bid up to a 
stratospheric 300-plus price/earnings ratio. At the close of 1989, Japan’s stock 
market, for the first time in history, unseated the U.S. stock market in total 
market value of all stocks. And this feat happened despite the fact that the total 
output of the Japanese economy was less than half that of the U.S. economy.

95
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Even some U.S. observers began to lose sight of the big picture and added to 
the rationalizations for why the high levels of Japanese stocks were justified. 
After all, it was reasoned, Japanese companies and executives were a tightly 
knit and closed circle, investing heavily in the stocks of other companies that 
they did business with. The supply of stock for outside buyers was thus lim-
ited as companies sat on their shares.
Corporate stock ownership went further, though, as stock prices were some-
times manipulated. Speculators gobbled up the bulk of outstanding shares of 
small companies and traded shares back and forth with others whom they 
partnered with to drive up prices. Company pension plans began to place all 
(as in 100 percent) of their employees’ retirement money in stocks with the 
expectation that stock prices would always keep going up.
The collapse of the Japanese stock market was swift. After peaking at the 
end of 1989, the Tokyo market fell nearly 50 percent in the first nine months 
of 1990 alone. By the middle of 1992, the worst of the damage was over, with 
Japanese stocks down nearly 65 percent — a drop that the U.S. market hasn’t 
experienced since the Great Depression. However, prices stagnated during 
the rest of the 1990s and then fell again in the early 2000s, finally reaching a 
bottom in 2003 that was more than 80 percent lower than the peak reached 
nearly 15 years prior. Japanese investors who borrowed lost everything and 
sometimes more. The total loss in stock market value was about $3 trillion, 
about the size of the entire Japanese annual output.
Several factors finally led to the pricking of the Japanese stock market 
bubble. Japanese monetary authorities tightened credit as inflation started to 
creep upward and concern increased over real estate market speculation. As 
interest rates began to rise, investors soon realized that they could earn 15 
times more interest from a safe bond versus the paltry yield on stocks.
As interest rates rose and credit tightened, speculators were squeezed first. 
Real estate and stock market speculators began to sell their investments to 
pay off mounting debts. Higher interest rates, less-available credit, and the 
already grossly inflated prices greatly limited the pool of potential stock 
buyers. The falling stock and real estate markets fed off each other. Investor 
losses in one market triggered more selling and price drops in the other. The 
real estate price drop was equally severe — registering 50 to 60 percent or 
more in most parts of Japan after the late 1980s.
The 1960s weren’t just about sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll
The U.S. stock market mirrored the climate of our country during this decade 
of change and upheaval. There were good years and bad years, but overall, 
the stock market gained. Unfortunately, most investors who were old enough 
to remember what happened to the stock market during the Great Depression 
were retired or had passed away. The majority of investors during the 1960s 
were born after the go-go years of the 1920s or were still sucking on a pacifier.

96
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
During the 1960s, consumer product companies’ stocks were quite popular 
and were bid up to stratospheric valuations. When I say “stratospheric valu-
ations,” I mean that some stock prices were high relative to the company’s 
earnings — our old friend, the price/earnings (P/E) ratio. Investors had seen 
such stock prices rise for many years and thought that the good times would 
never end.
Take the case of Avon Products, which sells cosmetics door-to-door, primar-
ily with an army of women. During the late 1960s, Avon’s stock regularly sold 
at a P/E of 50 to 70 times earnings. (Remember, the market average is about 
15.) After trading as high as $140 per share in the early 1970s, Avon’s stock 
took more than two decades to return to that price level. Remember that 
during this time period the overall U.S. stock market rose more than tenfold!
 
When a stock such as Avon’s sells at such a high multiple of earnings, two factors 
can lead to a bloodletting.
 
 First, the company’s profits may continue to grow, but investors may 
decide that the stock isn’t such a great long-term investment after all 
and not worth, say, a P/E of 60. Consider that if investors decide it’s 
worth only a P/E of 30 (still a hefty P/E), the stock price would drop 50 
percent to cut the P/E in half.
 
 The second shoe that can drop is the company’s profits or earnings. If 
profits fall, say, 20 percent, as Avon’s did during the 1974–75 recession, 
the stock price will fall 20 percent, even if it continued to sell for 60 times 
its earnings. But when earnings drop, investors’ willingness to pay an 
inflated P/E plummets along with the earnings. So when Avon’s profits 
finally did drop, the P/E that investors were willing to pay plunged to 9 — 
in less than two years, Avon’s stock price thus dropped nearly 87 percent!
Avon wasn’t alone in its stock price soaring to a rather high multiple of its 
earnings in the 1960s and early 1970s. Well-known companies such as Black & 
Decker, Eastman Kodak, Kmart (used to be called S.S. Kresge in those days), 
and Polaroid sold for 60 to as much as 100 times earnings. All these compa-
nies, like Avon, sell today at about the same or at a lower price than they 
achieved decades ago. Many other well-known and smaller companies sold at 
similar and even more outrageous premiums to earnings.
The 1920s consumer spending binge
The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared nearly 500 percent in a mere eight 
years, from 1921 to 1929, one of the best bull market runs for the U.S. stock 
market. The country and investors had good reason for economic optimism. 
“New” devices — telephones, cars, radios, and all sorts of electric appliances — 
were making their way into the mass market. The stock price of RCA, the radio 
manufacturer, for example, ballooned 5,700 percent during this eight-year 
stretch.

97
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Speculation in the stock market moved from Wall Street to Main Street. Investors 
during the 1920s were able to borrow lots of money to buy stock through margin 
borrowing. You can still margin borrow today — for every dollar that you put 
up, you may borrow an additional dollar to buy stock. At times during the 1920s, 
investors were able to borrow up to nine dollars for every dollar that they had 
in hand. The amount of margin loans outstanding swelled from $1 billion in the 
early 1920s to more than $8 billion in 1929. When the market plunged, margin 
calls forced margin borrowers to sell their stock, thus exacerbating the decline.
Manias in prior centuries
I could fill an entire book with modern-day stock 
market manias. But bear with me as I roll back 
the clocks a couple of centuries to observe 
other market manias, the first being England’s 
so-called South Seas bubble of 1719. South 
Seas wasn’t the kind of company that would’ve 
met today’s socially responsible investor’s 
needs. Initially, the South Seas Company 
focused on the African slave trade, but too 
many slaves died in transit, so it wasn’t a lucra-
tive business.
If you think government corruption is a prob-
lem today, consider what politicians of those 
days did without the scrutiny of a widely read 
press. King George backed the South Seas 
Company and acted as its governor. Politicos 
in Parliament bought tons of stock in the South 
Seas Company and even rammed through 
Parliament a provision that allowed investors to 
buy stock on borrowed money. The stock of the 
South Seas Company soared from about £120 
to more than £1000 in just the first six months 
of 1720.
After such an enormous run-up, insiders real-
ized that the stock price was greatly inflated 
and quietly bailed. Citizens fell all over them-
selves to get into this surefire moneymaker. 
Other seafaring companies pursued the South 
Seas trade business, so the greedy politicians 
passed a law that stated that only government-
approved companies could pursue trade. The 
stocks of these other companies tumbled, and 
investor losses led to a chain reaction that 
prompted selling of the South Seas Company 
stock, which plunged more than 80 percent by 
the autumn of that same year.
Unfortunately, England wasn’t the only European 
country that was swept up in an investment 
mania. Probably the most famous mania of 
them all was the tulip bulb (yes, those flowers 
that you can plant in your own home garden). A 
botany professor introduced tulips into Holland 
from Turkey in the late 1500s. Residents allowed 
a fascination with these bulbs turn into an 
investment feeding frenzy.
At their speculative peak, the price of a single 
tulip bulb was the equivalent of more than 
$10,000 in today’s dollars. Many people sold 
their land holdings to buy more. Documented 
cases show that people traded a bulb for a 
dozen acres of land! Laborers cut back on their 
work to invest. Eventually, tulip bulb prices 
came crashing back to earth. A trip to your local 
nursery shows you what a bulb sells for today.

98
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
The steep run-up in stock prices was also due in part to market manipulation. 
Investment pools used to buy and sell stock among one another, thus generat-
ing high trading volume in a stock, which made it appear that interest in the 
stock was great. Also in cahoots with pool operators were writers who dis-
pensed enthusiastic prognostications about said stock. (Reforms later passed 
by the Securities and Exchange Commission addressed these problems.)
Not only were members of the public largely enthusiastic, so too were the 
supposed experts. After a small decline in September 1929, economist Irving 
Fisher said in mid-October, “Stock prices have reached what looks like a per-
manently high plateau.” High? Yes! Permanent plateau? Investors wish!
On October 25, 1929, just days before all heck began breaking loose, 
President Herbert Hoover said, “The fundamental business of the country . . .
is on a sound and prosperous basis.” Days later, multimillionaire oil tycoon 
John D. Rockefeller said, “Believing that fundamental conditions of the coun-
try are sound . . . my son and I have for some days been purchasing sound 
common stocks.”
By December of that same year, the stock market had dropped by more 
than 35 percent. General Electric President Owen D. Young said at that time, 
“Those who voluntarily sell stocks at current prices are extremely foolish.”
Well, actually not. By the time the crash had run its course, the market had 
plunged 89 percent in value in less than three years.
The economy went into a tailspin. Unemployment soared to more than 25 
percent of the labor force. Companies entered this period with excess inven-
tories, which mushroomed further when people slashed their spending. High 
overseas tariffs stifled American exports. Thousands of banks failed, because 
early bank failures triggered “runs” on other banks. (No FDIC insurance 
existed in those days.)
 
Psychologically, it’s easier for many people to buy stocks after they’ve had a 
huge increase in price. Just as you shouldn’t attempt to drive your car looking 
solely through your rearview mirror, basing investments solely on past per-
formance usually leads novice investors into overpriced investments. If many 
people talk about the stunning rise in the market and new investors pile in 
based on the expectation of hefty profits, tread carefully.
I’m not saying that you need to sell your current stock holdings if you see an 
investment market getting frothy and speculative. As long as you diversify 
your stocks worldwide and hold other investments, such as real estate and 
bonds, the stocks that you hold in one market need to be only a fraction of 
your total holdings. Timing the markets is difficult: You can never know how 
high is high and when it’s time to sell, and then how low is low and when it’s 
time to buy. And if you sell non-retirement account investments at a profit, 
you end up sacrificing a lot of the profit to federal and state taxes.

99
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Buy more when stocks are “on sale”
 
Along with speculative buying frenzies come valleys of pessimism when stock 
prices are falling sharply. Having the courage to buy when stock prices are “on 
sale” can pay big returns.
In the early 1970s, interest rates and inflation escalated. Oil prices shot up as 
the oil embargo choked off supplies, and Americans had to wait in long lines 
for gas. Gold prices soared, and the U.S. dollar plunged in value on foreign 
currency markets.
If the economic problems weren’t enough to make most everyone gloomy, 
the U.S. political system hit an all-time low during this period as well. Vice 
President Spiro Agnew resigned in disgrace under a cloud of tax-evasion 
charges; then Watergate led to President Richard Nixon’s August 1974 resig-
nation, the first presidential resignation in our history.
When all was sold and done, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 
more than 45 percent from early 1973 until late 1974. Among the stocks that 
fell the hardest included those that were most popular and selling at extreme 
multiples of earnings in the late 1960s and early 1970s. (See the section “The 
1960s weren’t just about sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll,” earlier in this chapter.)
Take a gander at Table 5-2 to see the drops in some well-known companies 
and how cheaply these stocks were valued relative to corporate profits (look 
at the P/E ratios) after the worst market drop since the Great Depression.

Those who were too terrified to buy stocks in the mid-1970s actually had 
plenty of time to get on board and take advantage of the buying opportuni-
ties. The stock market did have a powerful rally and, from its 1974 low, rose 
nearly 80 percent over the next two years. But over the next half- dozen 
years, the market backpedaled, losing much of its gains.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, inflation continued to escalate well into 
double digits. Corporate profits declined further, and unemployment rose 
higher than in the 1974 recession. Although some stocks dropped, others 
simply treaded water and went sideways for years after major declines in the 
mid-1970s. As some companies’ profits increased, P/E bargains abounded (as 
shown in Table 5-3).

When bad news and pessimism abound and the stock market has dropped, it’s 
actually a much safer and better time to buy stocks. You may even consider 
shifting some of your money out of your safer investments, such as bonds, and 
invest more aggressively in stocks. Investors feel during these times that prices 
can drop farther, but if you buy and wait, you’ll be amply rewarded. Most of 
the stocks listed in the last several pages have appreciated 500 to 2,500-plus 
percent in the past couple of decades.

Avoiding Problematic Stock 
Buying Practices
 
You may be curious about other ways to buy individual stocks, but if I list 
those methods in this section, it’s because I don’t recommend using them. You 
can greatly increase your chances of success and earn higher returns if you 
avoid the commonly made stock investing mistakes that I present in this 
section.
Beware brokers’ conflicts of interest
Some investors make the mistake of investing in individual stocks through 
a broker who earns a living from commissions. The standard pitch of these 
firms and their brokers is that they maintain research departments that mon-
itor and report on stocks. Their brokers, using this research, tell you when 
to buy, sell, or hold. Sounds good in theory, but this system has significant 
problems.
 
Many brokerage firms happen to be in another business that creates enor-
mous conflicts of interest in producing objective company reviews. You see, 
these investment firms also solicit companies to help them sell new stock and 
bond issues. To gain this business, the brokerage firms need to demonstrate 
enthusiasm and optimism for the company’s future prospects.
Brokerage analysts who, with the best of intentions, write negative reports 
about a company find their careers hindered in a variety of ways. Some firms 
fire such analysts. Companies that the analysts criticize exclude the analysts 
from analyst meetings about the company. Analysts who know what’s good 
for their careers and their brokerage firms don’t write disapproving reports.
Although investment insiders know that analysts are overly optimistic, little 
documented proof about this fact exists, and few people are willing to talk on 
the record about it. One firm got caught encouraging its analysts via a memo 
not to say negative things about companies. As uncovered by Wall Street 
Journal reporter Michael Siconolfi, Morgan Stanley’s head of new stock issues 
stated in a memo that the firm’s policy needed to include “no negative com-
ments about our clients.” The memo also stated that any analyst’s changes 
in a stock’s rating or investment opinion, “which might be viewed negatively” 
by the firm’s clients, had to be cleared through the company’s corporate 
finance department head!

103
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Various studies of the brokerage firm’s stock ratings have conclusively dem-
onstrated that from a predictive perspective, most of its research is barely 
worth the cost of the paper that it’s printed on. In Chapter 6, I recommend 
independent research reports that beat the brokerage industry track record 
hands down. In Chapter 9, I cover the important issues that you need to con-
sider when you select a good broker.
Don’t day trade or short-term trade
Unfortunately (for themselves), some investors track their stock investments 
closely and believe that they need to sell after short holding periods —months, 
weeks, or even days. With the growth of Internet and computerized trading, 
such shortsightedness has taken a turn for the worse as more investors now 
engage in a foolish process known as day trading, where you buy and sell a 
stock within the same day!
 
If you hold a stock only for a few hours or a few months, you’re not investing; 
you’re gambling. Specifically, the numerous drawbacks that I see to short-term 
trading include the following:
 
 Higher trading costs: Although the commission that you pay to trade 
stocks has declined greatly in recent years, especially through online 
trading (which I discuss in Chapter 9), the more you trade, the more of 
your investment dollars go into a broker’s wallet. Commissions are like 
taxes — once collected, your dollars are forever gone, and your return 
is reduced. Similarly, the spread between what you pay to purchase a 
stock and the price you would receive to sell the same stock (known as 
the bid-ask spread) can be a significant drag on your investment return.
 
 More taxes (and tax headaches): When you invest outside of tax-sheltered 
retirement accounts, you must report every time that you buy and then 
sell a stock on your annual income tax return. After you make a profit, 
you must part with a good portion of it through the federal and state 
capital gains tax that you owe from the sale of your stock. If you sell a 
stock within one year of buying it, the IRS and most state tax authorities 
consider your profit short-term, and you owe a much higher rate of tax 
than if you hold your stock for more than a year. Holding your stock for 
more than a year qualifies you for the favorable long-term capital gains 
tax rate (a topic that I discuss in Chapter 21). The return that you keep 
(after taxes) is more important than the return that you make (before 
taxes).
 
 Lower returns: If stocks increase in value over time, long-term buy-and-
hold investors will enjoy the fruits of the stock’s appreciation. However, 
when you jump in and then out of stocks, your money spends a good 
deal of time not invested in stocks. The overall level of stock prices in 
general and individual stocks in particular sometimes rises sharply 
during short periods of time. Thus, day traders and other short-term 

104
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
traders inevitably miss some stock run-ups. The best professional inves-
tors whom I know don’t engage in short-term trading for this reason (as 
well as because of the increased transaction costs and taxes that such 
trading inevitably generates).
 
 Lost opportunities: Most of the short-term traders who I’ve met over 
the years spend inordinate amounts of time researching and monitor-
ing their investments. During the late 1990s, I began to hear of more and 
more people who quit their jobs so they could manage their investment 
portfolio full time! Some of the firms that sell day trading seminars tell 
you that you can make a living trading stocks. Your time is clearly worth 
something. Put your valuable time into working a little more on build-
ing your own business or career instead of wasting all those extra hours 
each day and week watching your investments like a hawk, which ham-
pers rather than enhances your returns.
 
 Poorer relationships: Time is our most precious commodity. In addi-
tion to the financial opportunities that you lose when you indulge in 
unproductive trading, you need to consider the personal consequences. 
Like drinking, smoking, and gambling, short-term trading is an addictive 
behavior. Spouses of day traders and other short-term traders report 
unhappiness over how much more time and attention their mates spend 
on their investments than their families. And what about the lack of 
attention that day traders and short-term traders give friends and other 
relatives? (See the sidebar “Recognizing an investment gambling prob-
lem” in this chapter to help determine whether you or a loved one has a 
gambling addiction.)
How a given stock performs in the next few hours, days, weeks, or even 
months may have little to do with the underlying financial health and vitality 
of the company’s business. In addition to short-term swings in investor emo-
tions, unpredictable events (the emergence of a new technology or competi-
tor, analyst predictions, changes in government regulation, and so on) push 
stocks one way or another for short periods of time.
 
As I say throughout this part of the book, stocks are intended to be long-term 
holdings. You shouldn’t buy stocks if you don’t plan on holding them for at 
least five years or more — and preferably seven to ten. When stocks suffer a 
setback, it may take months or even years for them to come back.
Don’t buy penny stocks
 
Even worse than buying stocks through a broker whose compensation 
depends on what you buy and how often you trade is purchasing penny stocks 
through brokers that specialize in such stocks. Tens of thousands of smaller-
company stocks trade on the over-the-counter market. Some of these compa-
nies are quite small and sport low prices per share that range from pennies to 
several dollars, hence the name penny stocks.

 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Recognizing an investment gambling problem
Some gamblers spend their time at the race-
track, and you can find others in casinos. 
Increasingly, though, you can find gamblers at 
their personal computers, tracking and trading 
stocks.
More investors than ever are myopically 
focused on stocks’ short-term price movements. 
Several factors contribute to this troubling 
activity: the continued growth of the Internet, 
the increased responsibility more folks have in 
managing their own retirement investments, 
and increased media coverage (including 
cable stock market channels). Also, companies 
touting themselves as educational institutions 
suck legions of novice investors into dangerous 
practices. Masquerading under such pompous 
names as institutes or academies, these firms 
purport to teach you how to get rich day trad-
ing stocks. Perhaps you’ve heard their ads on 
the radio or seen them on stock market cable 
television channels or on the Internet for “semi-
nars” or other “training” methods. All you have 
to do is part with several thousand dollars for 
the training, but the only people getting rich are 
the owners of such seminar companies.
The nonprofit organization Gamblers Anonymous 
developed the following 20 questions to help 
you figure out whether you or someone you 
know is a compulsive gambler who needs help. 
According to Gamblers Anonymous, compul-
sive gamblers typically answer yes to seven or 
more of these questions:
 1. Did you ever lose time from work or school 
due to gambling?
 2. Has gambling ever made your home life 
unhappy?
 3. Did gambling affect your reputation?
 4. Have you ever felt remorse after 
gambling?
 5. Did you ever gamble to get money with 
which to pay debts or otherwise solve 
financial difficulties?
 6. Did gambling cause a decrease in your 
ambition or efficiency?
 7. After losing, did you feel you must return 
as soon as possible and win back your 
losses?
 8. After a win, did you have a strong urge to 
return and win more?
 9. Did you often gamble until your last dollar 
was gone?
 10. Did you ever borrow money to finance your 
gambling?
 11. Have you ever sold anything to finance 
gambling?
 12. Were you reluctant to use “gambling 
money” for normal expenditures?
 13. Did gambling make you careless of the wel-
fare of your family?
 14. Did you ever gamble longer than you had 
planned?
 15. Have you ever gambled to escape worry or 
trouble?
 16. Have you ever committed, or consid-
ered committing, an illegal act to finance 
gambling?
 17. Did gambling cause you to have difficulty in 
sleeping?
 18. Do arguments, disappointments, or frustra-
tions create within you an urge to gamble?
 19. Did you ever have an urge to celebrate any 
good fortune by a few hours of gambling?
 20. Have you ever considered self-destruction 
as a result of your gambling?

106
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Here’s how penny-stock brokers typically work. Many of these firms pur-
chase prospect lists of people who have demonstrated a propensity for 
buying other lousy investments by phone. Brokers are taught to first intro-
duce themselves by phone and then call back shortly thereafter with a tre-
mendous sense of urgency about a great opportunity to get in on the “ground 
floor” of a small but soon-to-be stellar company. Not all of these companies 
and stocks have terrible prospects, but many do.
The biggest problem with buying penny stocks through such brokers is that 
they’re grossly overpriced. Just as you don’t make good investment returns 
by purchasing jewelry that’s marked up 100 percent, you don’t have a fighting 
chance to make decent money on penny stocks that the broker may flog with 
similar markups. The individual broker who cons you into “investing” in such 
cheap stocks gains a big commission, which is why he continues to call you 
with “opportunities” until you send him a check. Many brokers in this business 
who possess records of securities violations also possess an ability to sell, so 
they have no problem gaining employment with other penny-stock peddlers.
A number of penny-stock brokerage firms are known for engaging in manipu-
lation of stock prices, driving up prices of selected shares to suck in gullible 
investors and then leaving the public holding the bag. These firms may also 
encourage companies to issue new overpriced stock that their brokers can 
then sell to people like you.
If you remember a fellow by the name of Robert Brennan, you know that he is 
the granddaddy of this reptilian business. I won’t bore you with all the details 
except to say that after more than a decade of financial shenanigans, Brennan 
was ordered by a judge to pay investors more than $70 million for all the bad 
stuff that he did. And Brennan was sentenced to nearly a decade of prison time.
I remember when Brennan ran his infamous “Come Grow with Us” television 
ads, in which he hopped out of a helicopter. Brennan was always nicely 
dressed and maintained a polished image. In addition to being in the penny-
stock business, it’s interesting to note that Brennan owned a horse racetrack 
and wanted to get into the casino business. All Brennan’s businesses share 
the same characteristics — they don’t involve investments, and they stack 
the deck against the gullible members of the public whom they hoodwink.
The Keys to Stock Market Success
 
Anybody, no matter what their educational background, IQ, occupation, 
income, or assets, can make good money through stock investments. Over 
long periods of time, based on historic performance, you can expect to earn 
an average of 9 to 10 percent per year total return by investing in stocks.

107
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
 
To maximize your chances of stock market investment success, do the following:
 
 Don’t try to time the markets. Anticipating where the stock market and 
specific stocks are heading is next to impossible, especially over the short 
term. Economic factors, which are influenced by thousands of elements, 
as well as human emotions, determine stock market prices. Be a regular 
buyer of stocks with new savings. As I discuss earlier in this chapter, buy 
more stocks when they’re on sale and market pessimism is running high.
 
 Diversify. Invest in the stocks of different-size companies in varying 
industries around the world. When you assess the performance of your 
investments, look at your whole portfolio at least once a year, and calcu-
late your total return after expenses and trading fees.
 
 Keep trading costs, management fees, and commissions to a minimum. 
These represent a big drain on your returns. If you invest through an 
individual broker or “financial advisor” who earns a living on commis-
sions, odds are high that you’re paying far more than you need to be, 
and you’re likely receiving biased advice.
 
 Pay attention to taxes. Like commissions and fees, federal and state 
taxes are a major investment “expense” that you can minimize. Contribute 
most of your money to your tax-advantaged retirement accounts. You can 
invest your money outside of retirement accounts, but keep an eye on 
taxes (see Chapter 3). Calculate your annual returns on an after-tax basis.
 
 Don’t overestimate your ability to pick the big winning stocks. One of 
the best ways to invest in stocks is through mutual funds (see Chapter 8), 
where you can use an experienced, full-time money manager at a low 
cost to perform all the investing grunt work for you.

T
his chapter provides a crash course in researching individual companies 
and their stocks. Be sure that you consider your reasons for taking this 
approach before you head down the path of picking and choosing your own 
stocks. If you haven’t already done so, please read Chapter 5 to better under-
stand the process of purchasing stocks on your own.
If you decide to tackle the task of researching your own stocks, you don’t 
need to worry about finding enough information: The problem to worry about 
is information overload. You can literally spend hundreds of hours researching 
and reading information on one company alone. Therefore, unless you’re finan-
cially independent and want to spend nearly all your productive time investing, 
you need to focus on where you can get the best bang for your buck and time.
Building on Others’ Research
If you were going to build a house, I bet that you wouldn’t actually try to do it 
on your own. At the very least, you’d probably find some sort of kit or a set of 
plans drawn up by others who have built many houses. You can do the same 
when it comes to picking individual stocks. In this section, I highlight useful 
resources that allow you to hit the ground running when trying to pick the 
best stocks. In addition to the resources I cover here, please see Chapter 19 
for a list and description of numerous other useful resources for researching 
individual stocks.

Discovering the Value Line 
Investment Survey
 
Value Line’s securities analysts have tracked and researched stocks since the 
Great Depression. Their analysis and recommendation track record is quite 
good, and their analysts are beholden to no one. Many professional money 
managers use Value Line as a reference because of its comprehensiveness.
The beauty of Value Line’s service is that it condenses the key information 
and statistics about a stock (and the company behind the stock) to a single 
page. Suppose that you’re interested in investing in Starbucks, the retail 
coffeehouse operator. You’ve seen all its stores, and you figure that if you’re 
going to shell out more than $3 for a cup of its flavored hot water, you may 
as well participate in the profits and growth of the company. You look up the 
recent stock price (I explain how to do that later in this chapter if you don’t 
know how) and see that it’s $19 per share.
Let’s take a look at the important elements of a Value Line page for Starbucks, 
shown in Figure 6-1.
 
The information in Value Line reports is in no way inside information. Look at 
these reports the same way that you review a history book — they’re useful 
background information that can keep you from repeating common mistakes.
1. Business
This section describes the business(es) that Starbucks participates in. You 
can see that Starbucks is the largest retailer of specialty coffee in the world. 
Although 85 percent of the company’s sales come from retail, note that 15 
percent come from other avenues — such as mail order and supermarket 
sales. You also find details about joint ventures, such as the partnership of 
Starbucks and Pepsi to develop and sell a bottled coffee drink. In this section, 
you also can see that the senior executives and directors of the company 
own a sizeable stake (5.5 percent) of the stock — it’s good to see these folks 
have a financial stake in the success of the company and stock.
2. Analyst assessment
A securities analyst (in this case, Justin Hellman) follows each Value Line 
stock. An analyst focuses on specific industries and follows a few dozen 
stocks. This section provides the analyst’s summary and commentary of the 
company’s current situation and future plans.
Hellman notes that although the company and stock are facing some near-
term challenges, the shares are attractive over the longer term.

3. Value Line’s rating
Value Line provides a numerical ranking for each stock’s timeliness (expected 
performance) over the next year. One is highest, 5 is lowest, and only about 
5 percent of all stocks receive these extreme ratings. A 2 rating is above aver-
age and a 4 rating below average, and about one-sixth of the ranked stocks 
receive each of these ratings. All remaining stocks, a little more than half the 
total ranked, get the average 3 rating.
The safety rank works the same way as the timeliness rating, with 1 rep-
resenting the best and least volatile stocks and the most financially stable 
companies. Five is the worst safety ranking and is given to the most volatile 
stocks and least financially stable companies.
I’ve never been a fan of predictions and short-term thinking. (One year is a 
very short period of time for the stock market.) However, historically, Value 
Line’s system holds one of the best overall track records according to the 
Hulbert Financial Digest, which tracks the actual performance of investment 
newsletter recommendations. However, you shouldn’t necessarily run out 
and buy Starbucks because of its high ranking. Just keep in mind that higher-
ranked stocks within Value Line have historically outperformed those with-
out such ratings.
4. Stock price performance
This graph shows you the stock price’s performance over the past decade or 
so. The highest and lowest points of the line on the graph indicate the high and 
low stock price for each month. At the top of the graph you see the year’s high 
and low prices. Starbucks stock has steadily risen since it first issued stock in 
1992, but the company certainly has experienced some down periods. (The 
small box in the lower-right corner of the graph shows you the total return that 
an investor in this stock earned over the previous one, three, and five years 
and how those returns compare with the average stock. This graph shows you 
that Starbucks declined significantly over the past one to three years but has 
increased over the past five years.)
The graph also shows how the price of the stock moves with changes in the 
company’s cash flow (money coming in minus money going out). Over time, 
just as stock prices tend to track corporate profits, so too should they gen-
erally follow cash flow. Cash flow is an important measure of a company’s 
financial success and health — it’s different from net profits, which the com-
pany reports for tax purposes. For example, the tax laws allow companies to 
take a tax deduction each year for the depreciation (devaluation) of the com-
pany’s equipment and other assets. Although depreciation is good because it 
helps lower a company’s tax bill, subtracting it from the company’s revenue 
gives an untrue picture of the company’s cash flow. Thus, in calculating a 
company’s cash flow, depreciation isn’t subtracted from revenue.

113
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
5. Historic financials
This section shows you 12 to 18 years of financial information on the com-
pany (in the case of Starbucks, you get information going back to just 1992 
because that’s when the company went public). The two most helpful pieces 
of information in this section are
 
 Book value per share: This indicates the value of the company’s assets, 
including equipment, manufacturing plants, and real estate, minus any 
liabilities. Book value gives somewhat of a handle on the amount that 
the company can sell for if it has a “going-out-of-business sale.” I say 
somewhat because the value of some assets on a company’s books isn’t 
correct. For example, some companies own real estate, bought long ago, 
that is worth far more than the company’s current financial statements 
indicate. Conversely, some manufacturers with equipment find that if 
they have to dump some equipment in a hurry, they need to sell the 
equipment at a discount to entice a buyer.
 
 The book value of a bank, for example, can mislead you if the bank 
makes loans that won’t be paid back, and the bank’s financial statements 
don’t document this fact. All these complications with book value are 
why full-time, professional money managers exist. (If you want to delve 
more into a company’s book value, you need to look at other financial 
statements, such as the company’s annual report, which I discuss in the 
“Understanding Annual Reports” section, later in this chapter.)
 
 Market share: For some companies (not Starbucks), Value Line also pro-
vides another useful number in this section — the market share, which 
indicates the portions of the industry that the company has captured in a 
given year. A sustained decline in a company’s market share is a dangerous 
sign that may indicate its customers are leaving for other companies that 
presumably offer better products at lower prices. But that doesn’t mean 
that you should avoid investing in a company that has such problems. 
You can produce big returns if you can identify companies that reposition 
and strengthen their product offerings to reverse a market share 
decrease.
6. P/E ratio
This tells you that Starbucks sells at a P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) of 19.9 
because of its recent stock price and earnings. This P/E is higher than that of 
the overall market. (You can see that Starbucks’ P/E is 1.23 times that of the 
overall market.) To understand the importance of P/E in evaluating a stock, 
please refer to Chapter 5.
7. Capital structure
This section summarizes the amount of outstanding stocks and bonds that 
the company possesses. Remember that when a company issues these secu-
rities, it receives capital (money). What is most useful to examine in this 
section is the company’s debt. If a company accumulates a lot of debt, the 

114
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
burden of interest payments can create a real drag on profits. If profits stay 
down for too long, debt can even push some companies into bankruptcy.
Figure 6-1 shows you that Starbucks has outstanding debt of $4 million. This 
section delineates between two types of debt:
 
 Short-term debt: Debt due within one year
 
 Long-term debt: Debt that has to be paid back in more than a year
So how do you know if this is a lot, a little, or just the right amount of debt? You 
can calculate long-term interest earned, which compares a company’s annual prof-
its to the yearly interest payments on its long-term debt. For example, if a com-
pany has long-term interest earned of 4.5x, that means that the company’s most 
recent yearly profits can cover the interest payments on its long-term debt for 
about 41/2 years. Starbucks has little debt — the company’s most recent annual 
profits of $392 million dwarf its long-term interest payments of $0.1 million.
Possessing a larger cushion to cover debt is more important when the 
company’s business is volatile. Total interest coverage represents a similar 
comparison of profits to interest owed for all the debt that a company owes, 
not just long-term debt. This number tells you the number of years that the 
company’s most recent annual profits can cover interest on all the compa-
ny’s debt. Warning signs for total interest coverage numbers include a steep 
decline in this number over time and profits that cover less than one year’s 
worth of interest.
8. Current position
This section provides a quick look at how the company’s current assets (cur-
rent meaning an asset that can be sold and converted into cash within a year 
relatively easily) compared with its current liabilities (debts due within the 
year). Trouble may be brewing if a company’s current liabilities exceed or are 
approaching its current assets.
 
Some financial analysts calculate the quick ratio. The quick ratio ignores inven-
tory when comparing current assets to current liabilities. A company may have 
to dump inventory at a relatively low price if it needs to raise cash quickly. 
Thus, some analysts argue, you need to ignore inventory as a current asset.
9. Annual rates
This nifty section can save wear and tear on your calculator. The good folks 
at Value Line calculate rates of growth (or shrinkage) on important financial 
indicators, such as sales (revenues) and earnings (profits) over the past five 
and ten years. Value Line also lists its projections for the next five years.

115
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
 
Projections can prove highly unreliable, even from a research firm as good as 
Value Line. In most cases, the projections assume that the company will con-
tinue as it has in the most recent couple years.
10. Quarterly financials
For the most recent years, Value Line shows you an even more detailed quar-
terly breakout of sales and profits, which may disclose changes that annual 
totals mask. You can also see the seasonality of some businesses. Starbucks, 
for example, tends to have its slowest quarter in the winter (quarter ending 
March 31). This makes sense if you figure that many of the customers who 
frequent Starbucks’ coffee shops do so as they walk around town, which 
people tend to do less of on a blustery winter day.
Considering independent 
brokerage research
If you’re going to invest in individual stocks, you’ll need a brokerage account. 
In addition to low trading fees, the best brokerage firms allow you to easily 
tap into useful research, especially through the firm’s Web site, that will 
assist you with your investing decisions.
Get ting your hands on Value Line reports
The least costly way to obtain Value Line pages 
on stocks that interest you is to visit your local 
library. Most libraries that have decent busi-
ness sections subscribe to it.
If you want your own copy of Value Line to 
read in the comfort of your home, Value Line 
(800-634-3583) offers a 13-week trial subscrip-
tion to its Value Line Investment Survey for $75. 
An annual subscription costs $598. At the start 
of your subscription, you receive a rather large 
binder, divided into 13 sections, that includes 
the most recent reports on the 1,700-plus larger- 
company stocks that this publication tracks. 
Every week, you receive a new packet of reports 
that replaces one of the 13 sections. Thus, at the 
end of 13 weeks, you have new reports on all 
the stocks. (If you prefer, an electronic edition 
is available for $65 for the 13-week trial; $538 
yearly.)
The trial subscription is a great place to start 
your research because you receive all the 
current reports plus three months’ worth of 
updates for a reasonable fee. You can also see 
how much use you get out of the reports. The 
trial offer is available to each household only 
once every three years.
Value Line also offers a Small and Mid-Cap 
Edition that contains reports on about 1,800 
additional smaller companies. Unlike traditional 
Value Line pages, these pages include no ana-
lyst commentary or projections. A one-year 
subscription to this publication costs $249.

116
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Because discount brokers aren’t in the investment banking business of work-
ing with companies to sell new issues of stock, discount brokers have a level 
of objectivity in their research reports that too often is absent among tradi-
tional brokers (ones like Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and so on). Some dis-
count brokers, such as Charles Schwab, produce their own highly regarded 
research reports, but most discount brokers simply provide reports from 
independent third parties.
Please see Chapter 9 for how to select a top-notch brokerage firm.
Examining successful money 
managers’ stock picks
 
To make money in stocks, you certainly don’t need an original idea. In fact, it 
makes sense to examine what the best money managers are buying for their 
portfolios. Don’t worry; I’m not suggesting that you invade their privacy or ask 
rude questions!
Mutual fund managers, for example, are required to disclose at least twice 
a year what stocks they hold in their portfolio. You can call the best fund 
companies and ask them to send their most recent semiannual reports that 
detail their stock holdings; you can also view those reports on many fund 
company’s Web sites. (See Chapter 8 for more information on the best stock 
mutual funds.)
Through its Web site, Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) allows you to 
see which mutual funds hold large portions of a given stock that you may 
be researching and what the success or lack thereof is of the funds buying a 
given stock.
Finally, you can follow what investment legend Warren Buffett is buying 
through his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway. If you’d like to review 
Berkshire’s complete corporate filings on your own, visit the Securities and 
Exchange Commission Web site at www.sec.gov.
Reviewing financial publications 
and Web sites
Many publications and Web sites cover the world of stocks. Be careful. Just 
because a columnist or publication advocates particular stocks or investing 
strategies doesn’t mean you’ll achieve success by following her advice.

117
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
 
The following publications offer useful columns and commentary, sometimes 
written by professional money managers, on individual stocks: Barron’s, 
Business Week, Forbes, Kiplinger’s, and The Wall Street Journal. In addition, 
hundreds of Web sites are devoted to stock picking. I name my favorite invest-
ing sites in Chapter 19.
Understanding Annual Reports
After you review the Value Line page on a company and want to dig further 
into financial documents, the next step is to ask yourself why. Why do you 
want to torture yourself so?
I successfully completed one of the supposedly better MBA programs (Stanford’s) 
and took more than my fair share of accounting and finance courses. Over the 
years, I’ve gotten to know investment managers and financial analysts who 
research companies. Although some financial documents aren’t that difficult to 
read (I show you how in this section), interpreting what they mean in respect 
to a company’s future isn’t easy.
 
All publicly traded companies must annually file certain financial documents. 
Consider reviewing these documents to enhance your understanding of a com-
pany’s businesses and strategies rather than for the predictive value that you 
may hope they provide.
The first of such useful documents that companies produce is the annual report. 
This yearly report provides standardized financial statements as well as manage-
ment’s discussion about how the company has performed and how it plans to 
improve its performance in the future. If you’re a bit of the skeptical sort, like 
I am, you may think, “Aren’t the company’s officials going to make everything 
sound rosy and wonderful?”
To a certain extent, yes, but not as badly as you may think, especially at 
companies that adhere to sound accounting principles and good old-fashioned 
ethics. First, a large portion of annual reports includes the company’s financial 
statements, which an accounting firm must audit. However, audits don’t mean 
that companies and their accounting firms can’t (often legally) structure the 
company’s books to make them look rosier than they really are. And some 
companies have pulled the wool over the eyes of their auditors, who then 
became unwitting accomplices in producing false financial figures.
 
You’ve surely heard of the accounting scandals at companies such as Enron 
and WorldCom. These companies manipulated their financial books, with the 
blessing of supposedly blue-chip corporate auditors, to mislead investors into 
believing that they were more profitable than they really were. (Identifying 
trouble before other investors do is a skill that many professional investors 
haven’t mastered — if you can identify trouble early, go manage other 
people’s money!)

118
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Also keep in mind that more than a few companies have been sued for 
misleading shareholders with inflated forecasts or lack of disclosure of 
problems. Responsible companies try to present a balanced and, of course, 
hopeful perspective in their annual reports. Most companies’ annual reports 
are written by non-techno geeks, so you have a decent chance of understand-
ing them.
Financial and business highlights
The first section of most annual reports presents a description of a com-
pany’s recent financial highlights and business strategies. You can use this 
information to find out about the businesses that the company is in and 
where the company is heading. For example, in Figure 6-1, Value Line men-
tioned that Starbucks is also in the specialty sales business. The annual 
report can provide more detail about Starbucks’ specialty business.
Okay, enough about the coffee business — I want to expose you to another 
industry. T. Rowe Price is a publicly traded investment management com-
pany that offers some good mutual funds. In Figure 6-2, you can see T. Rowe 
Price’s discussion of the most recent year’s business activity.

Balance sheet
You can find a company’s hard-core financials in the back portion of most 
annual reports. You can find many of these same numbers in Value Line 
reports, except you get more specific details in the company’s annual report. 

119
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
All annual reports contain a balance sheet, which is a snapshot summary of 
all the company’s assets (what the company owns) and liabilities (what the 
company owes). The balance sheet covers the company’s assets and liabili-
ties from the beginning of the year to the last day of the company’s year-end, 
which is typically December 31. Some companies use a fiscal year that ends 
at other times of the year.
A company’s balance sheet resembles a personal balance sheet. The entries, 
of course, look a little different because you likely don’t own things like man-
ufacturing equipment. Figure 6-3 shows a typical corporate balance sheet.
Assets
The assets section lists the following items that the company holds or owns 
that are of significant value:
 
 Cash: I suspect that you know what cash is. Lest you think that stacks of 
green bills sit around in corporate vaults, rest assured that companies 
invest this money to earn interest. Many items are explained in more 
detail in explanatory notes that follow these financial statements. Note 1 
explains that T. Rowe Price eats its own cooking — the company keeps 
its extra cash in its own money market funds.
 
 Accounts receivable: This is money that is owed to the company, such 
as invoices that haven’t been paid yet by customers.
 
 As companies grow, their accounts receivable usually do, too. Watch 
out for cases where the receivables grow faster than the sales (revenue). 
This growth may indicate that the company is having problems with its 
products’ quality or pricing. Unhappy customers pay more slowly or 
demand bigger price discounts.
 
 Investments: In addition to cash, some companies may invest in other 
securities, such as bonds and stocks. Just as with your own personal 
situation, companies usually invest money that they don’t expect to use 
in the near future. (As with the company’s cash investments, the explan-
atory note states that T. Rowe Price invests in its own bond and stock 
funds, as well as other lending investments listed as debt securities.)
 
 Property and equipment: All companies need equipment to run their 
businesses. This equipment can include office furniture, computers, 
real estate they own, and manufacturing machinery that the company 
uses to make its products. Equipment becomes less valuable over time, 
so the company considers this depreciation as a cost of doing business 
each year. Therefore, if a company ceases buying new equipment, this 
entry on the balance sheet gradually decreases because the depreciation 
is subtracted from the value of the equipment.

 Goodwill: One of the assets that doesn’t show up on most companies’ 
balance sheets is their goodwill. Companies work hard through advertis-
ing, product development, and service to attract and retain customers. 
Name-brand recognition is a term that you sometimes hear thrown around. 
Companies can’t put a value on the goodwill that they’ve generated, but 
when they purchase (acquire) another firm, some of the purchase price is 
considered goodwill. Specifically, if a company is acquired for $100 million 
but has a net worth (assets minus liabilities) of just $50 million, the extra 
$50 million goes to goodwill. The goodwill then becomes an asset on the 
acquiring company’s balance sheet.

121
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
 
 Other assets: This is a catch-all category that may include some stuff 
that can make your eyes glaze over. For example, companies keep a dif-
ferent set of books for tax purposes (yes, this is legal). Not surprisingly, 
companies do this because the IRS allows, in some cases, more deduc-
tions than what the company is required to show from an account-
ing standpoint on their financial statements. (If you were a company, 
wouldn’t you want your shareholders, but not the IRS, to see gobs 
of profits?) Companies treat tax deferment as an asset until the IRS 
receives more of its share down the road.
 
Manufacturing and retail companies also track and report inventory (the 
product that hasn’t yet been sold) as an asset. Generally speaking, as a 
business grows, so does its inventory. If inventory grows more quickly than 
revenue, such growth may be a warning sign. This growth can indicate that 
customers are scaling back purchases and that the company miscalculated 
and overproduced. It can also be a leading indicator of an obsolete or inferior 
product offering.
Liabilities
This section summarizes all the money that the company owes to others:
 
 Accounts payable: When a company places orders to purchase 
things for its business, it sometimes has a lag between receiving a bill 
and when it pays it; the money owed is called accounts payable. As 
with inventory and accounts receivable, accounts payable generally 
increases with a company’s increasing revenue.
 
 If accounts payable increases faster than revenue, it can indicate a problem. 
On the other hand, that increase can also be a sign of good financial 
management. The longer you take to pay your bills, the longer you have 
the money in your pocket working for you.
 
 Accrued compensation: This line tallies money that the company must 
someday pay its employees. For example, many larger firms maintain 
pension plans. These plans promise workers who retire with at least 
five years of service a monthly income check in retirement. Thus, the 
company must reserve this money that it owes and list it as a liability or 
debt that it must someday pay.
 
 Income taxes payable: Companies are in business to make a profit, and 
as they earn those profits, they need to reserve a portion to pay income 
taxes. As I explain in the previous section, some of the taxes that the com-
pany owes can be caused by accounting differences between the company’s 
financial statements and those filed with the IRS.
 
 Dividends payable: Not all companies pay dividends (see Chapter 4) to 
their shareholders. But those companies that do pay dividends typically 
declare the dividend several weeks in advance of when they actually 
owe the dividend. During this interim period, the company lists the not-
yet-paid dividends as a liability.

122
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Stockholders’ equity
The difference between a company’s assets and liabilities is known as stock-
holders’ equity. Stockholders’ equity is what makes balance sheets always 
balance.
 
When companies issue stock, they receive cash, which they then list as an 
asset. Companies divide stock proceeds between par value and capital in 
excess of par value. In the case of T. Rowe Price, the par value is $0.20 per 
share. Par values are arcane — and largely meaningless.
Income statement
The other big financial statement in an annual report is the income statement 
(see Figure 6-4).
Revenue
Revenue is simply the money that the company receives from its customers 
as compensation for its products or services. Just as you can earn income 
from your job(s) as well as investments and other sources, a company can 
make money from a variety of sources. In the case of mutual fund provider T. 
Rowe Price, the firm collects fees (investment advisory and administrative) 
for the mutual fund investments that it manages on behalf of its customers 
as well as privately managed money for wealthy individuals and institutions. 
The company also receives income from its own money that it has invested.
 
Ideally, you want to see a steady or accelerating rate of growth in a company’s 
revenue. If a company’s revenue grows more slowly, you need to inquire why. 
Is it because of poor service or product performance, better competitor 
offerings, ineffective marketing, or all of the above?
For companies with multiple divisions or product lines, the annual report 
may detail the revenue of each product line in a later section. If it doesn’t, 
check out some of the other financial statements that the next section, 
“Exploring Other Useful Corporate Reports,” recommends. Examine what 
spurs or holds back the company’s overall growth and what different busi-
nesses the company operates in. Look for businesses that were acquired but 
don’t really fit with the company’s other business units as a red flag. Large 
companies that have experienced stalled revenue growth sometimes try to 
“enter” new businesses through acquisition but then don’t manage them well 
because they don’t understand the keys to their success.
 
When researching retail stores, such as restaurant chains (for example, 
McDonald’s) or clothing stores (such as The Gap), examine the revenue 
changes that come from opening new locations versus the changes at exist-
ing locations, sometimes referred to as same stores. Be concerned if you find 

123
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
that a company’s revenue growth comes from opening new locations rather 
than growth at existing locations. This may indicate that weakness in the 
company’s business is being masked by simply opening more locations.
Expenses
Just as personal income taxes, housing, food, and clothing expenses gobble 
up much of your personal income, company expenses use up much and 
sometimes all of a company’s revenue.

Even healthy, growing businesses can get into trouble if their expenses 
grow faster than their revenues. Well-managed companies stay on top of their 
expenses during good and bad times. Unfortunately, it’s easy for companies 
to get sloppy during good times.

124
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
It’s particularly useful to examine each category of expenses relative to (in 
other words, as a percentage of) the company’s revenue to see which grow or 
shrink. As a well-managed and financially healthy company grows, expenses 
as a percentage of revenue should decrease. As this happens, profits as a per-
centage of revenue increase. This has been the case with T. Rowe Price over 
this time period. Not all expense categories necessarily decrease.
Net income calculations
The net result of expenses increasing slower than revenues is a fatter bottom 
line. In T. Rowe Price’s case, net income increased from 28.5 percent to 30.1 
percent of revenue between 2005 and 2007. When you examine how a com-
pany’s profits change relative to total revenue received, focus on operating 
income. Sometimes companies experience one-time events, such as the sale 
of a division, that can change profits temporarily. Companies usually list 
these one-time events in the section under expenses.
 
I also encourage you to review a company’s statement of cash flows included 
in its annual report. Cash can flow into and out of a company from normal 
business operations, investment activities, and financing activities. Sometimes 
a company may report higher profits but actually be facing decreased cash flow 
from operations, for example, if its customers are getting slower with paying bills 
(which could indicate that its customers are having financial problems or they’re 
unhappy with the product or service being provided).
Earnings per share
Last but not least, and of great importance to shareholders, is the calcula-
tion of earnings per share. Higher profits per share generally help fuel a 
higher stock price, and declining profits feed falling stock prices. Remember, 
though, that smart financial market participants are looking ahead, so if you 
run out to buy stock in a company that is reporting higher profits, it’s old 
news and likely already priced into the company’s current market value.
Exploring Other Useful Corporate Reports
In addition to annual reports, companies produce other financial statements 
that you may want to peruse. You can generally obtain these from the com-
pany’s Web site, by contacting the company’s investor relations department, 
or from the Securities and Exchange Commission Web site, www.sec.gov. 
(See Chapter 19 for more on this site.)
10-Ks
10-Ks are expanded versions of an annual report. Most investment profes-
sionals read the 10-K instead of the annual report because the 10-K contains 

125
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
additional data and information, especially for a company’s various divisions 
and product lines. Also, 10-Ks contain little of the verbal hype that you find in 
most annual reports. The 10-K is probably one of the most objective reports 
that a company publishes. If you’re not intimidated by annual reports, or you 
want more company meat, go for it!
10-Qs
10-Qs provide information similar to the 10-K but on a quarterly basis. 10-Qs 
are worthwhile if you like to read a reasonably detailed discussion by 
management of the latest business and financial developments at the com-
pany. However, I recommend leaving the research to Value Line’s analysts.
The financial data in these reports is unaudited and not of great use for the 
long-term investor. If you want to watch your investments like a hawk and try 
to be among the first to detect indications of financial problems (easier said 
than done), this report is required reading.
 
Many companies go back to restate their quarterly financials. Remember that 
the accountants haven’t approved these interim numbers. Sometimes compa-
nies take their financial lumps in one quarter to get problems behind them, so 
one bad quarter doesn’t necessarily indicate a harmful long-term trend.
Proxies
The final corporate document that you may want to review is the annual proxy 
statement, which is sent out in advance of a company’s annual meeting. The 
proxy statement contains some of the more important financial information and 
discussions that you can find in the 10-K. It also contains information on other 
corporate matters, such as the election of the board of directors. Directors — 
who are usually corporate executives, lawyers, accountants, and other knowl-
edgeable luminaries — serve as sounding boards, counselors, and sometimes 
overseers to the management team of a company.
The proxy statement becomes much more important when a company faces 
a takeover or some other controversial corporate matter, such as the elec-
tion of an alternative board of directors. As a shareholder, you get to vote on 
proposed board members and on select other corporate issues.
The proxy statement tells you who serves on the board of directors as well as 
how much they and the executives of the company are paid. At annual meet-
ings, where the board of directors discusses proxy statements, shareholders 
sometimes get angry and ask why the executives are paid so much when the 
company’s stock price and business underperform.

Getting Ready to Invest in Stocks
Especially during the late 1990s, amid the chorus of self-anointed gurus 
saying that you can make fat profits if you pick your own stocks, I sometimes 
thought that I was a lone voice urging caution and sensible thinking.
 
Unless you’re extraordinarily lucky or unusually gifted at analyzing company 
and investor behavior, you won’t earn above-average returns if you select 
your own stocks.
Keep to a minimum — ideally, no more than 20 percent of your invested 
dollars — the amount that you dedicate to individual stock investments. I 
encourage you to do such investing for the educational value and enjoyment 
that you derive from it, not because you smugly think you’re as skilled as the 
best professional money managers. (If you want to find out more about ana-
lyzing companies, read the chapters in Part IV on small business as well as 
the investing-resources chapters in Part V.)
Fundamental versus technical analysis
Throughout this chapter and Chapter 5, I talk a 
lot about the financial statements and analysis 
of a company — balance sheets, revenues, 
expenses, earnings, price/earnings ratios, 
and so on. Analyzing financial statements and 
making investing decisions based on them is 
known as fundamental analysis.
Another school of stock market analysis, known 
as technical analysis, exists. Folks who employ 
technical analysis like to examine chart patterns, 
volume, and all sorts of indicators that have little 
if anything to do with the underlying stock.
Technicians say things like “Stock XYZ has 
a major support area at $20 per share” and 
“Stock ABC has broken out above $30 per 
share.” Although it may be a bit extreme to say 
that all the technicians who have ever existed 
have never produced anything of value, you 
can safely ignore this school of thinking. In fact, 
ignoring the technicians will likely increase your 
stock market profits. Why? Because technical 
analysis thinking encourages a trader’s, not an 
investor’s, mindset.
Not surprisingly, most technicians come from 
one of two camps. Many technical analysts work 
for brokerage firms and write daily, weekly, or 
monthly assessments of the entire stock market 
and some individual stocks. Recommendations 
and advice change over time, and the result is 
that you trade more. Not coincidentally, these 
brokerage firms make more money the more 
you trade! Investment newsletter writers are 
the other big advocates of this Ouija-board 
approach to investment management. Again, 
it’s a great system for the newsletter writers 
who hook you on a $200-per-year newsletter.

127
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
Understanding stock prices
Just about every major financial and news site on the Internet offers stock 
quotes, usually for free as a lure to get you to visit the site. To view a stock 
price quote online, all you need is the security’s trading symbol (which you 
obtain by using the stock symbol look up feature universally offered with 
online quote services). Most major newspapers print a listing of the prior 
day’s stock prices. Daily business papers such as The Wall Street Journal and 
Investor’s Business Daily publish stock prices daily.
Cable business channels such as Bloomberg, CNBC, and Fox Business have 
stock quotes streaming across the bottom of the screen. You can stop by 
a local brokerage office and see the current stock quotes whizzing by on a 
long, narrow screen on a wall. Many brokerage firms also maintain publicly 
accessible terminals (that look a lot like a personal computer) on which you 
can obtain current quotes.
The following table is a typical example of the kinds of information that you 
can find in daily price quotes in papers and online — in this case, for the 
information technology giant International Business Machines (also known as 
Big Blue or IBM). After the name of the company, you see the trading symbol, 
IBM, which is the code that you and brokers use to look up the price on 
computer-based quotation systems.

Here’s a breakdown of what this information means:
 
 52-Week Range: These two numbers indicate the low ($88.77) and high 
($121.46) trading prices for IBM during the past 52 weeks.
 
 Last Trade: This line indicates the most recent price that the stock 
traded at (you can see that I happened to get this IBM quote at 10:36 
a.m. Eastern Standard Time).
 
 Change: This entry indicates how that price differs from the previous 
day’s close. In this case, you can see that the stock was up 0.37 points 
(0.36 percent) from the prior day’s close.
 
 Day’s Range: These two numbers are lowest and highest prices that the 
stock traded at during the day.
 
 Open: This line tells you the trade price at the market’s open.
 
 Volume: This number indicates the number of shares that traded 
through this point in the trading day. (To conserve space, many news-
papers indicate the volume in hundreds of shares — in other words, 
you must add two zeros to the end of the number to arrive at the actual 
number of shares.)
 
 The P/E ratio: As I explain in Chapters 4 and 5, the P/E ratio measures 
the price of IBM’s stock relative to the company’s earnings or profits.
 
 Market capitalization: This tells you the current market value of all of 
IBM’s stock, which in this case is $142.8 billion. It is arrived at by mul-
tiplying the current price per share by the total number of shares out-
standing. (See Chapter 8 for an explanation of so-called market caps as 
they apply to stocks and stock funds.)
 
 Dividends/share: This shows you the current dividend, which in this 
case is $1.60 per share, which the company pays yearly to shareholders. 
Most companies actually pay out one-quarter of their total annual divi-
dend every three months.
 
 Yield: This number indicates the effective percentage yield that the 
stock’s dividend produces. To calculate the effective yield, divide the 
dividend by the current stock price. Thus, IBM shareholders can expect 
to receive a dividend worth about 1.5 percent of the current stock price.
Now you know how to read stock quotes!
Purchasing stock “direct” from companies
Over the years, increasing numbers of companies have begun to sell their 
stock directly to the public. Proponents of these direct stock purchase plans 

129
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
say that you can invest in stocks without paying any commissions. This isn’t 
quite true, and investing in such plans poses other challenges.
If you want to purchase directly from Home Depot, for example, you need a 
minimum initial investment of $500. Buying stock “direct” isn’t free — in the 
case of Home Depot, for example, you will be charged a $5 enrollment fee. 
Although that may not sound like much on a $500 investment, $5 represents 
1 percent of your investment. For subsequent purchases, you pay 5 percent 
up to a maximum of $2.50 per purchase plus 5 cents per share. And although 
you can reinvest your dividends from Home Depot directly in buying more 
shares of its stock, you have to pay the same fee you must pay for any subse-
quent purchase. If you want to sell your shares, you need to pay a fee to do 
that, too — $10 plus 15 cents per share. Overall, these fees compare to what 
you would pay to buy stock through a discount broker (see Chapter 9). And 
in some cases, these fees are higher! For example, you can reinvest dividends 
at no cost through many discount brokers.
Some direct stock purchase plans entail even more hassle and cost than 
the type I just discussed. With other plans, you must buy your initial shares 
through a broker and then transfer your shares to the issuing company in 
order to buy more! Also, most direct stock purchase plans can’t be done 
within retirement accounts.
 
Every time that you want to set up a stock purchase plan with a company, 
you must request and complete the company’s application forms. If you go 
through the headache of doing so, say, a dozen times, you’re rewarded with a 
dozen statements on a regular basis from each individual company. Frankly, 
because of this drawback alone, I prefer to buy stock through a discount 
brokerage account that allows centralized purchasing and holding of various 
stocks as well as consolidated tax-reporting statements.
Placing your trade through a broker
Unless you decide to buy stock directly, you generally need a broker. As I 
explain in Chapter 9, discount brokers are the best way to go — they take 
your orders and charge far less than conventional brokerage firms, which 
pay their brokers on commission.
After you decide which discount broker you want to use (again, I provide all 
the info you need to make this decision in Chapter 9), request (by phone or 
via the Internet) an account application package for the type of account that 
you desire (non-retirement, IRA, Keogh, and so on). Complete the forms (call 
the firm’s toll-free number or visit a branch office if you get stuck) and mail 
or take them back to the discounter.

130
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
When it comes time to place your order, simply call the discount broker and 
explain what you want to do (or use your touch-tone phone or computer to 
place your order). You have two options:
 
 Market order: My advice is to place what’s known as a market order. 
Such an order instructs your broker to buy you the amount of stock that 
you desire (100 shares, for example) at the current and best (lowest) 
price available.
 
 Limit order: Alternatively, you can try to buy a desired stock at a spe-
cific price — for example, you can place a purchase order at $32 per 
share when the stock’s last trade was $33 per share. This type of order 
is known as a limit order and is good until you cancel it. I don’t rec-
ommend that you try this tactic because it requires you to hope and 
gamble that the stock drops a little before it rises. If the stock simply 
rises from its current price of $33 per share or drops to $32.10 before 
it makes a big move higher, you may kick yourself. If you think that the 
stock is a good buy for the long haul, go buy it with a market order. If 
you don’t think it’s a good buy, don’t buy it.
 
One final word of advice: Try to buy stock in good-size chunks, such as 100 
shares. Otherwise, commissions gobble a large percentage of the small dollar 
amount that you invest. If you don’t have enough money to build a diversified 
portfolio all at once, don’t sweat it. Diversify over time. Purchase a chunk of 
one stock after you have enough money accumulated and then wait to buy the 
next stock until you’ve saved another chunk to invest.

ending investments are those in which you lend your money to an 
organization, such as a bank, company, or government, which typically 
pays you a set or fixed rate of interest. (Ownership investments, by contrast, 
provide partial ownership of a company or some other asset, such as real 
estate, that has the ability to generate revenue and potential profits.)
If you really want to make your money grow, lending investments aren’t for 
you. However, even the most-aggressive investors should consider placing 
some of their money into lending investments. Table 7-1 shows when such 
investments make and don’t make sense.

Lending investments are everywhere — through banks, credit unions, 
brokerage firms, insurance companies, and mutual fund companies. 
Lending investments that you may have heard of include bank accounts 
(savings and certificates of deposit), treasury bills and other bonds, bond 
mutual funds (and now exchange-traded bond funds), mortgages, and 
guaranteed-investment contracts.
In this chapter, I walk you through these investments and explain what’s good 
and bad about each of them and when you should and shouldn’t use them. 
I also tell you what to look for (and look out for) when comparing them.
Banks: The Cost of Feeling Secure
Putting your money in a bank may make you feel safe for a variety of reasons. 
If you’re like most people, your first investing experience was at your 
neighborhood bank where you established checking and savings accounts.
Part of the comfort of keeping money in the bank stems from the fact that 
the bank is where many of our parents first steered us financially. Also, at a 
local branch, often within walking distance of your home or office, you find 
vaults, security-monitoring cameras, and barriers in front of the tellers. Most 
of these latter accoutrements shouldn’t make you feel safer about leaving 
your money with the bank — they’re needed because of bank robberies and 
the preponderance of guns in our society. Consider that the next time you 
pay a visit to your local bank.
 
Bank branches cost a lot of money to operate. Guess where that money comes 
from? From bank depositors, of course! That’s one of the reasons why the 
interest rates that banks pay often pale in comparison to similarly secure 
alternatives.
The realities of bank insurance
Some people are consoled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC) insurance that comes with bank accounts. It’s true that if your bank 
fails, your account is insured by the U.S. government up to $100,000. So what, 
I say. Any Treasury bond is issued and backed by the federal government — 
the same $9 trillion-debt-ridden organization that stands behind the FDIC. 
Plenty of other equally safe lending investments yield higher returns.
 
Just because the federal government stands behind the banking FDIC system 
doesn’t mean that your money is 100 percent safe in the event of a bank 
failure. Although you’re insured for $100,000 in a bank, if the bank crashes, 
you may wait quite a while to get your money back — and you may well get 

133
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments
less interest than you thought you would. Banks fail and will continue to fail. 
During the 1980s and early 1990s, hundreds of insured banks and savings and 
loans failed annually. In recent years, only a handful of banks failed annually.
Any investment that involves lending your money to someone else or to 
some organization carries risk. That includes putting your money in a bank 
or buying a Treasury bond that the federal government issues. Although 
I’m not a doomsayer, any student of history knows that governments and 
civilizations fail.
The overused certificate of deposit (CD)
Other than savings accounts, banks also sell certificates of deposit (CDs). 
CDs are without a doubt the most overused bank investment around. The 
attraction is that you get a higher rate of return on a CD than on a bank 
savings or money market account. And unlike a bond, which I discuss in the 
“Why Bother with Bonds?” section, later in this chapter, a CD’s principal 
value doesn’t fluctuate. CDs also give you the peace of mind afforded by the 
government’s FDIC insurance program.
The reason that CDs pay higher interest rates than savings accounts is 
that you commit to tie up your money for a period of time, such as 6, 12, or 
24 months. The bank pays you 2 to 3 percent and then turns around and 
lends your money to people through credit cards, auto loans, and the like 
and charges the borrower an interest rate of 10-plus percent. Not a bad 
business, eh?
When you tie up your money in a CD, and later you decide you want it back 
before the CD matures, a hefty penalty (about six months’ interest) is shaved 
from your return. With other lending investments, such as bonds and bond 
mutual funds (discussed in the section “Why Bother with Bonds?”, later in 
this chapter), you can access your money without penalty and generally at 
little or no cost.
In addition to penalties for early withdrawal, CDs yield less than a high-
quality bond with a comparable maturity (for example, two, five, or ten 
years). Often, the yield difference is 1 percent or more, especially if you don’t 
shop around and simply buy CDs from the local bank where you keep your 
checking account.
High-tax-bracket investors who purchase CDs outside of their retirement 
accounts should be aware of a final and perhaps fatal flaw of CDs: The inter-
est on CDs is fully taxable at the federal and state levels. Bonds, by contrast, 
are available (if you desire) in tax-free (federal and/or state) versions.

134
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
You can earn higher returns and have better access to your money in bonds 
than in CDs. Bonds make especially good sense when you’re in a higher tax 
bracket and would benefit from tax-free income in a non-retirement account. 
CDs make the most sense when you know, for example, that you can invest 
your money for one year, after which you need the money for some purchase 
that you expect to make. Just make sure that you shop around to get the best 
interest rate. If having the U.S. government insurance gives you peace of mind, 
take a look at Treasury bonds, which I discuss later in this chapter. Treasury 
bonds (also known as treasuries) tend to pay more interest than many CDs.
The money market fund alternative 
to savings accounts
I don’t keep extra savings in the bank. Because bank savings accounts 
generally pay pretty crummy interest rates, you need to think long and hard 
about keeping spare cash in the bank.
You can, if you so choose, keep your checking account at your local bank. 
(I don’t because I use a money market fund that offers unlimited check 
writing at a mutual fund company.)
Money market funds, which are a type of mutual fund (other funds focus on 
bonds or stocks), are a great place to keep your extra savings. Money market 
funds offer a higher-yielding alternative to bank savings and bank money 
market deposit accounts.
Money market funds, which are offered by mutual fund companies (see 
Chapter 8), are unique among mutual funds because they don’t fluctuate 
in value and maintain a fixed $1-per-share price. As with a bank savings 
account, your principal investment in a money market fund doesn’t change 
in value. If you invest your money in a money fund, it earns dividends (which 
is just another name for the interest you would receive in a bank account).
Money market fund advantages
The best money market mutual funds offer several significant benefits over 
bank savings accounts. The biggest advantage is higher yields. Money market 
mutual funds pay higher yields because they don’t have the high overhead 
that banks do. The most efficient mutual fund companies (I discuss them in 
Chapter 8) don’t have scads of branch offices. Another reason that banks can 
get away with paying lower yields is that they know that many depositors 
believe that the FDIC insurance that comes with a bank savings account 
makes it safer than a money market mutual fund. Also, the FDIC insurance is 
an expense that banks ultimately pass on to their customers.

135
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments
Another advantage of money market funds over bank accounts is that money 
funds come in a variety of tax-free versions. So if you’re in a high tax bracket 
(see Chapter 3), tax-free money market funds offer you something that bank 
accounts don’t.
Another useful feature of money market mutual funds is the ability to write 
checks, without charge, against your account. Most mutual fund companies 
require that the checks that you write be for larger amounts — typically at 
least $250. They don’t want you using these accounts to pay all of your small 
household bills because checks cost money to process.
 
Money market funds are a good place to keep your emergency cash reserve 
of at least three to six months’ living expenses. They’re also a great place to 
keep money awaiting investment elsewhere in the near future. If you’re saving 
money for a home that you expect to purchase soon (in the next year or so), a 
money fund can be a safe place to accumulate and grow the down payment. 
You don’t want to risk placing such money in the stock market, because the 
market can plunge in a relatively short period of time.
Just as you can use a money market fund for your personal purposes, you 
can open a money market fund for your business. I have one for my business. 
You can use this account to deposit checks that you receive from customers, 
to hold excess funds, and to pay bills via the check-writing feature.
A few money market funds (such as those that brokerage cash management 
accounts at firms such as Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, and 
Fidelity offer) allow you to write checks for any amount and can completely 
replace a bank checking account. Some brokerage firms will hit you with 
service fees if you don’t have enough assets with them or you don’t have 
regular monthly electronic transfers, such as through direct deposit of your 
paycheck or money transfer from your bank account. With these types of 
money market funds, you can leave your bank altogether because these 
brokerage accounts often come with debit cards that you can use at bank 
ATMs for a nominal fee.
Money funds lack insurance
Higher yields, tax-free alternatives, and check writing — it almost sounds too 
good to be true. What’s the catch? Good money market funds really don’t 
have any, but you need to know about one difference between bank accounts 
and money market mutual funds: Money funds aren’t insured. As I discuss 
earlier in this chapter, bank accounts come with FDIC insurance that protects 
your deposited money up to $100,000. So if a bank fails because it lends too 
much money to people and companies that go bankrupt or abscond with the 
funds, you should get your money back from the FDIC.

136
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
The lack of FDIC insurance on a money fund shouldn’t trouble you. Mutual 
fund companies can’t fail because they have a dollar invested in securities 
for every dollar that you deposit in their money funds. By contrast, banks 
are required to have available just 12 cents for every dollar that you hand 
over to them.
A money market fund’s investments can decline slightly in value, which can 
cause the money fund’s share price to fall below a dollar. A few cases have 
occurred where money market funds bought some bad investments. 
However, in each and every case except one, the parent company running 
the money fund infused cash into the affected fund, thus enabling it to 
maintain the $1-per-share price.
One money market fund did “break the buck.” It didn’t take money in from 
people like you or me but was run by a bunch of small banks for themselves. 
This money market fund made some boneheaded investments. The share 
price of the fund declined by 6 percent, and the fund owners decided to 
disband the fund; they didn’t bail it out because they would only have been 
repaying themselves.
 
Stick with bigger mutual fund companies if you’re worried about the lack of 
FDIC insurance. They have the financial wherewithal and the largest incentive 
to save a foundering money fund. Fortunately, the bigger fund companies have 
the best money funds anyway. You can find more details about money market 
funds in Chapter 8.
Why Bother with Bonds?
Conservative investors prefer bonds (that is, conservative when it comes 
to taking risk, not when professing their political orientation). Otherwise-
aggressive investors who seek diversification or investments for shorter-term 
financial goals also prefer bonds. The reason: Bonds offer higher yields than 
bank accounts, usually without as much volatility as the stock market.
Bonds are similar to CDs, except that bonds are securities that trade in the 
market with a fluctuating value. For example, you can purchase a bond, 
scheduled to mature five years from now, that a company such as the retail-
ing behemoth Wal-Mart issues. A Wal-Mart five-year bond may pay you 
6 percent interest. The company sends you interest payments on the bond 
for five years. And as long as Wal-Mart doesn’t have a financial catastrophe, 
the company returns your original investment to you after the five years is 
up. So in effect, you’re loaning your money to Wal-Mart (instead of the bank 
when you deposit money in a bank account).

137
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments
 
The worst that can happen to your bond investment is that Wal-Mart’s busi-
ness goes into a tailspin and the company ends up in financial ruin — also 
known as bankruptcy. If that happens, you may lose all of your original invest-
ment and miss out on the remaining interest payments you were supposed 
to receive.
But bonds that high-quality companies such as Wal-Mart issue are quite 
safe — they rarely default. Besides, you don’t have to invest all of your 
money in just one or two bonds. If you own bonds in many companies and 
one bond unexpectedly takes a hit, it affects only a small portion of your 
portfolio. And unlike CDs, you can generally sell your bonds anytime you 
desire at minimal cost. (Selling and buying most bond mutual funds costs 
nothing, as I explain in Chapter 8.)
 
Bond investors accept the risk of default because bonds generally pay you 
more than bank savings and money market mutual funds, but there’s a catch. 
As I discuss later in this chapter, bonds are riskier than money market funds 
and savings accounts because their value can fall if interest rates rise. Plus 
you’re forgoing the security of FDIC insurance as compared to bank accounts. 
However, bonds tend to be more stable in value than stocks. (I cover the risks 
and returns of bonds and stocks in Chapter 2.)
Investing in bonds is a time-honored way to earn a better rate of return on 
money that you don’t plan to use within the next couple of years or more. As 
with stocks, bonds can generally be sold any day that the financial markets 
are open. Because their value fluctuates, though, you’re more likely to lose 
money if you’re forced to sell your bonds sooner rather than later. In the 
short term, if the bond market happens to fall and you need to sell, you could 
lose money. In the longer-term, as is the case with stocks, you’re far less 
likely to lose money.
 
Don’t put your emergency cash reserve into bonds — that’s what a money 
market fund or bank savings account is for. And don’t put too much of your 
longer-term investment money into bonds, either. As I explain in Chapter 2, 
bonds are generally inferior investments for making your money grow. 
Growth-oriented investments, such as stocks, real estate, and your own busi-
ness, hold the greatest potential to build real wealth.
The following list provides some common financial goals and reasons why 
investing some money in bonds can make sense:
 
 A major purchase: This purchase should be one that won’t happen 
for at least two years, such as buying a home or some other major 
expenditure. Shorter-term bonds may work for you as a higher-yielding 
and slightly riskier alternative to money market funds.
 
 Diversification: Bonds don’t move in tandem with the performance of 
other types of investments, such as stocks. In fact, in a terrible eco-
nomic environment (such as during the Great Depression), bonds may 
appreciate in value while riskier investments such as stocks plunge.

138
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
 Retirement investments: You may invest some of your money in bonds 
as part of a longer-term investment strategy, such as for retirement. 
You should have an overall plan for how you want to invest your money, 
sometimes referred to as an asset allocation strategy (see Chapter 8). 
Aggressive, younger investors should keep less of their retirement 
money in bonds than older folks who are nearing retirement.
 
 Income-producing investments: If you’re retired or not working, bonds 
can be useful because they’re better at producing current income than 
many other investments.
Assessing the Different Types of Bonds
Bonds aren’t as complicated and unique as people, but they’re certainly 
more complex than a bank savings account. And thanks to shady marketing 
practices by some investing companies and salespeople who sell bonds, you 
can have your work cut out for you while trying to get a handle on what many 
bonds really are and how they differ from their peers.
Bonds differ from one another according to a number of factors — length to 
maturity, credit quality, and the entities that issue the bonds (the latter of 
which has associated tax implications that you need to be aware of). After 
you have a handle on these issues, you’re ready to consider investing in 
individual bonds and bond mutual funds.
Determining when you get your 
money back: Maturity matters
 
Maturity simply means the time at which the bond promises to pay back your 
principal — next year, in 7 years, in 15 years, and so on. You need to care how 
long it takes a bond to mature because a bond’s maturity gives you a good 
(although far-from-perfect) sense of how volatile a bond may be if interest 
rates change. If interest rates fall, bond prices rise; if interest rates rise, bond 
prices fall. Longer-term bonds drop more in price when the overall level of 
interest rates rises.
Suppose that you’re considering investing in two bonds that the same organi-
zation issues, and both yield 7 percent. The bonds differ from one another 
only in when they will mature: One is a 2-year bond; the other, a 20-year 
bond. If interest rates were to rise just 1 percent (from 7 percent to 8 per-
cent), the 2-year bond might decline about 2 percent in value, whereas the 
20-year bond could fall approximately five times as much — 10 percent.
If you hold a bond until it matures, you get your principal back unless the 
issuer defaults. In the meantime, however, if interest rates rise, bond prices 

139
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments
fall. The reason is simple: If the bond that you hold is issued at, say, 7 per-
cent, and interest rates on similar bonds rise to 8 percent, no one (unless 
they don’t know any better) wants to purchase your 7 percent bond. 
The value of your bond has to decrease enough so that it effectively yields 
8 percent.
Bonds are generally classified by the length of time until maturity:
 
 Short-term bonds mature in the next few years.
 
 Intermediate-term bonds come due within three to ten years.
 
 Long-term bonds mature in more than 10 years and generally up to 30 
years. Although rare, a number of companies issue 100-year bonds! A 
number of railroads did, as well as Coca-Cola, Disney, IBM, the New York 
Port Authority, and government of China! Such bonds are quite danger-
ous to purchase, especially if they’re issued during a period of relatively 
low interest rates.
Most of the time, longer-term bonds pay higher yields than short-term 
bonds. You can look at a chart of the current yield of similar bonds plotted 
against when they mature — such a chart is known as a yield curve. At most 
times, this curve slopes upward. Investors generally demand a higher rate 
of interest for taking the risk of holding longer-term bonds. Most financial 
newspapers, magazines, and Web sites carry a current chart of the Treasury 
yield curve.
Weighing the likelihood of default
In addition to being issued for various lengths of time, bonds differ from one 
another in the creditworthiness of the issuer. Every year, billions of dollars’ 
worth of bonds default (that sounds like a lot, but it’s a small fraction of 
the multitrillion-dollar bond market). To minimize investing in bonds that 
default, purchase highly rated bonds. Credit rating agencies such as Moody’s, 
Standard & Poor’s, Fitch, and Duff & Phelps rate the credit quality and 
likelihood of default of bonds.
The credit rating of a bond depends on the issuer’s (company or government) 
ability to pay back its debt. Bond credit ratings are usually done on some 
sort of a letter-grade scale where, for example, AAA is the highest rating, with 
ratings descending through AA and A, followed by BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, 
and so on.
 
 AAA- and AA-rated bonds are considered high-grade or high-credit 
quality bonds. Such bonds possess little chance — a fraction of 
1 percent — of default.
 
 A- and BBB-rated bonds are considered investment-grade or general-
quality bonds.

140
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
 BB- or lower-rated bonds are known as junk bonds (or by their marketed 
name, high-yield bonds). Junk bonds, also known as non-investment grade, 
are more likely to default — perhaps as many as a couple of percent per 
year actually default.
 
 You may ask yourself why any right-minded investor would buy a bond 
with a low credit rating. That’s because companies pay a higher interest 
rate on lower-quality bonds to attract investors. The lower a bond’s 
credit rating and quality, the higher the yield you can and should expect 
from such a bond. Poorer-quality bonds, though, aren’t for the faint of 
heart because they’re generally more volatile in value.
 
 I don’t recommend buying individual junk bonds — consider investing in 
these only through a well run junk-bond fund.
Examining the issuers (and 
tax implications)
Bonds also differ from one another according to the type of organization 
that issues them — in other words, what kind of organization you lend your 
money to. The following sections go over the major options and let you know 
when each option may make sense for you.
Treasury bonds
Treasuries are IOUs from the U.S. government. The types of Treasury bonds 
include Treasury bills (which mature within a year), Treasury notes (which 
mature between one and ten years), and Treasury bonds (which mature in 
more than ten years). These distinctions and delineations are arbitrary — 
you don’t need to know them for an exam.
Treasuries pay interest that is state-tax-free but federally taxable. Thus, 
they make sense if you want to avoid a high state-income-tax bracket but 
not a high federal-income-tax bracket. However, most people in a high 
state-income-tax bracket also happen to be in a high federal-income-tax 
bracket. Such high-tax-bracket investors may be better off in municipal bonds 
(explained in the next section), which are both federal- and state-tax-free.
 
The best use of Treasuries is in place of bank CDs. If you feel secure with the 
federal government insurance (which is limited to $100,000) that a bank CD 
provides, check out a Treasury bond (which has the unlimited backing of the 
U.S. government). Treasuries that mature in the same length of time as a CD 
almost always pay the same or a better interest rate. If you hunt around, you 
may stumble upon a bank that pays a slightly higher interest rate than a com-
parable Treasury bond. Just remember that bank CD interest is fully taxable, 
whereas a Treasury’s interest is state-tax-free. Unless you really shop for a 

141
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments
bank CD, you will likely earn a lower return on a CD than on a Treasury. I 
explain how to purchase Treasury bonds in the section “Buying Treasuries,” 
later in this chapter.
Municipal bonds
Municipal bonds are state and local government bonds that pay interest 
that’s federal-tax-free and state-tax-free to residents in the state of issue. 
For example, if you live in California and buy a bond issued by a California 
government agency, you probably won’t owe California state or federal 
income tax on the interest.
The government organizations that issue municipal bonds know that the 
investors who buy municipals don’t have to pay most or any of the income 
tax that is normally required on other bonds — which means that the 
issuing governments can pay a lower rate of interest.
 
If you’re in a high tax bracket and you want to invest in bonds outside tax-
sheltered retirement accounts, you may end up with a higher after-tax yield 
from a municipal bond (often called muni) than a comparable bond that pays 
taxable interest. Compare the yield on a given municipal bond (or muni bond 
fund) to the after-tax yield on a comparable taxable bond (or bond fund).
Corporate bonds
Companies such as Boeing, Johnson & Johnson, and Sunoco issue corporate 
bonds. Corporate bonds pay interest that’s fully taxable. Thus, they’re 
appropriate for investing inside retirement accounts. Only lower-tax-bracket 
investors should consider buying such bonds outside a tax-sheltered retire-
ment account. (Higher-bracket investors should instead consider municipal 
bonds.) In the section “Understanding bond prices,” later in this chapter, I 
show you how to read the newspaper listings for such bonds. If you buy cor-
porate bonds through a well-managed mutual fund, an approach I advocate, 
you don’t need to read the newspaper listings.
Mortgage bonds
Remember that mortgage you took out when you purchased your home? 
Well, you can actually purchase a bond to invest in a portfolio of mortgages 
just like yours! Many banks actually sell their mortgages as bonds in the 
financial markets, which allows other investors to invest in them. The repay-
ment of principal on such bonds is usually guaranteed at the bond’s maturity 
by a government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage 
Association (GNMA, also known as Ginnie Mae) or the Federal National 
Mortgage Association (FNMA, also known as Fannie Mae).
The vast majority of mortgage bonds are quite safe to invest in. The risky 
ones that were in the news in the late 2000s for defaulting were so-called sub-
prime mortgages, which lacked government agency backing.

142
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Convertible bonds
Convertible bonds are hybrid securities — they’re bonds that you can convert 
under specified circumstance into a preset number of shares of stock in the 
company that issued the bond. Although these bonds do pay taxable interest, 
their yield is lower than nonconvertible bonds because convertibles offer 
you the upside potential of being able to make more money if the underlying 
stock rises.
Inflation-protected Treasury bonds
The U.S. government now offers bonds called Treasury inflation-protected 
securities (TIPS). Compared with traditional Treasury bonds (which I discuss 
earlier in this chapter), the inflation-indexed bonds carry a lower interest 
rate. The reason is that the other portion of your return with these inflation-
indexed bonds comes from the inflation adjustment to the principal you 
invest. The inflation portion of the return gets added back into principal. For 
example, if inflation were 3 percent the first year you hold your inflation-
indexed bond into which you invested $10,000, your principal would increase 
to $10,300 at the end of the first year.
What’s appealing about these newer bonds is that no matter what happens 
with the rate of inflation, investors who buy inflation-indexed bonds will 
always earn some return (the yield or interest rate paid) above and beyond 
the rate of inflation. Thus, holders of inflation-indexed Treasuries can’t have 
the purchasing power of their principal or interest eroded by high inflation.
Because inflation-indexed Treasuries protect the investor from the ravages of 
inflation, they represent a less risky security. As I discuss in Chapter 2, lower 
risk usually translates into lower returns.
International bonds
You can buy bonds outside the country that you 
call home. If you live in the United States, for 
example, you can buy most of the bonds that I 
describe in this chapter from foreign issuers as 
well. International bonds are riskier to you 
because their interest payments can be offset 
by currency price changes.
The prices of foreign bonds tend not to move 
in tandem with U.S. bonds. Foreign bond 
values benefit from and thus protect against a 
declining U.S. dollar and, therefore, offer some 
diversification value. Although the declining 
dollar during most of the 2000s boosted the 
return of foreign bonds, the U.S. dollar appreci-
ated versus most currencies during the 1980s 
and 1990s, which lowered a U.S. investor’s 
return on foreign bonds.
Foreign bonds aren’t a vital holding for a diver-
sified portfolio. Foreign bonds are generally 
more expensive to purchase and hold than 
comparable domestic bonds.

143
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments
Buying Bonds
You can invest in bonds in one of two major ways: You can purchase individ-
ual bonds, or you can invest in a professionally selected and managed portfo-
lio of bonds via a bond mutual fund (newer exchange-traded funds are a twist 
on mutual funds). In this section, I help you make that decision and promptly 
send you to Chapter 8 should you fall on the side of mutual funds. If you want 
to take the individual-bond route, I cover that path here, where I explain how 
to decipher bond listings you find in financial newspapers or online and the 
purchasing process for Treasuries (a different animal in that you can buy 
them directly from the government) and all other bonds.
Deciding between individual bonds 
and bond mutual funds
 
Unless the bonds you’re considering purchasing are easy to analyze and 
homogeneous (such as Treasury bonds), you’re generally better off investing 
in bonds through a mutual fund. The first reason is diversification. You 
shouldn’t put your money into a small number of bonds that companies in 
the same industry issue or that mature at the same time. It’s difficult to cost-
effectively build a diversified bond portfolio with individual issues unless 
you have a substantial amount of money ($1 million) that you want to invest 
in bonds.
If you purchase individual bonds through a broker, you’re going to pay a 
commission. In most cases, the commission cost is hidden — the broker 
quotes you a price for the bond that includes the commission. Even if you 
use a discount broker, these fees take a healthy bite out of your investment. 
The smaller the amount that you invest, the bigger the bite — on a $1,000 
bond, the commission fee can equal several percent. Commissions take a 
smaller bite out of larger bonds — perhaps less than 0.5 percent if you use 
discount brokers.
Zero coupon bonds
Some bonds that you may have heard of or 
are interested in have unusual features. For 
example, not all bonds make regular interest 
payments. A zero coupon bond is sold at a 
substantial discount to its future maturity 
value. Thus, an investor in a zero coupon bond 
implicitly earns interest if the value of the bond 
should rise over time to reach full value by 
maturity. Zero coupon bonds are highly sensi-
tive to interest rate changes, which is why I 
don’t generally recommend them.

Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
The best reason to invest in bond funds instead of individual bonds is that 
you’ve got better things to do with your time. Do you really want to research 
bonds and go bond shopping? Bonds are boring! And bonds and the compa-
nies that stand behind them aren’t that simple to understand. For example, 
did you know that some bonds can be called before their maturity date? 
Companies often call bonds (which means they repay the principal before 
maturity) to save money if interest rates drop significantly. After you pur-
chase a bond, you need to do the same things that a good bond mutual fund 
portfolio manager needs to do, such as track the issuer’s creditworthiness 
and monitor other important financial developments.
A final reason to invest in bonds through a mutual fund is that it’s cost 
effective. Great bond funds are yours for less than 0.5 percent per year in 
operating expenses. Selecting good bond funds isn’t hard, as I explain 
in Chapter 8.
Understanding bond prices
Business-focused publications, such as The Wall Street Journal, provide 
daily bond pricing. You may also call a broker or browse Web sites to obtain 
bond prices. The following steps walk you through the bond listing for PhilEl 
(Philadelphia Electric) in Figure 7-1:
 
1. Bond name: This tells you who issued the bond. In this case, the issuer 
is a large utility company, Philadelphia Electric.

2. Funny numbers after company name: The first part of the numerical 
sequence here — 71/8 — refers to the original interest rate (7.125 
percent) that this bond paid when it was issued. This interest rate is 
known as the coupon rate, which is a percent of the maturity value of the 
bond. The second part of the numbers — 23 — refers to the year that 
the bond matures (2023, in this case).
 
3. Current yield: Divide the interest paid, 7.125, by the current price per 
bond, $93, to arrive at the current yield. In this case, it equals (rounded 
off) 7.7 percent.
 
4. Volume: Indicates the number of bonds that traded on this day.
 
5. Close: Shows the last price that the bond traded at.
 
6. Change: Indicates how this day’s close compares with the previous 
day’s close. In this case, this bond rose 2
1⁄8 points. Some bonds don’t 
trade all that often. Notice that some bonds were up and others were 
down on this particular day. The demand of new buyers and the supply 
of interested sellers influence the price movement of a given bond.
 
In addition to the direction of overall interest rates, changes in the financial 
health of the company that stands behind the bond strongly affect the price 
of an individual bond.
Buying Treasuries
If you want to purchase Treasury bonds, buying them through the Federal 
Reserve is the lowest-cost method. The Federal Reserve doesn’t charge for 
accounts with less than $100,000 and charges $25 annually for accounts with 
more than $100,000 in Treasury bonds. Contact a Federal Reserve branch 
near you (check the government section of your local phone directory) 
and ask it to mail you information about how to purchase Treasury bonds 
through the Treasury Direct program. Or you can call 800-722-2678 or visit 
the U.S. Department of Treasury’s web site (www.treasurydirect.gov).
You may also purchase and hold Treasury bonds through brokerage firms 
and mutual funds. Brokers typically charge a flat fee for buying a Treasury 
bond. Buying Treasuries through a brokerage account makes sense if you 
hold other securities through the brokerage account and you like the ability 
to quickly sell a Treasury bond that you hold.
Selling Treasury bonds held through the Federal Reserve is now much easier 
than it used to be. With a Treasury Direct account, you can sell online for 
$45 per transaction.

146
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
The advantage of a mutual fund that invests in Treasuries is that it typically 
holds Treasuries of differing maturities, thus offering diversification. You can 
generally buy and sell no-load (commission-free) Treasury bond mutual funds 
easily and without fees. Funds, however, do charge an ongoing management 
fee. The Vanguard Group of mutual funds offers Treasury mutual funds with 
good track records and low management fees (see Chapter 8).
Buying other individual bonds
 
Purchasing other types of individual bonds, such as corporate and mortgage 
bonds, is a much more treacherous and time-consuming undertaking than 
buying Treasuries. Here’s my advice for doing it right and minimizing the 
chance of a catastrophic mistake:
 
 Don’t buy through salespeople. Brokerage firms that employ represen-
tatives on commission are in the sales business. Many of the worst 
bond-investing disasters have befallen customers of such brokerage 
firms. Your best bet is to purchase individual bonds through discount 
brokers (see Chapter 9).
 
 Don’t be suckered into high yields — buy quality. Yes, junk bonds pay 
higher yields, but they also have a much higher chance of default. And 
did you know what a subprime mortgage was before it was all over the 
news in 2007 that defaults were on the rise? Subprime mortgages are 
mortgage loans made to borrowers with lower credit ratings who pay 
higher interest rates because of their higher risk of default. Nothing 
personal, but you’re not going to do as good a job as a professional 
Assessing individual bonds that you already own
If you already own individual bonds, and they fit 
your financial objectives and tax situation, you 
can hold them until maturity because you 
already incurred a commission when they were 
purchased; selling them now would just create 
an additional fee. When the bonds mature, the 
broker who sold them to you will probably be 
more than happy to sell you some more. That’s 
the time to check out good bond mutual funds 
(see Chapter 8).
Don’t mistakenly think that your current 
individual bonds pay the yield that they had 
when they were originally issued. (That yield is 
the number listed in the name of the bond on 
your brokerage account statement.) As the 
market level of interest rates changes, the 
effective yield (the interest payment divided by 
the bond’s price) on your bonds fluctuates as 
well, to rise and fall with the market level of 
rates. So if rates have fallen since you bought 
your bonds, the value of those bonds has 
increased — which in turn reduces the effec-
tive yield that you earn.

147
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments
money manager at spotting problems and red flags. Stick with highly 
rated bonds so you don’t have to worry about and suffer through these 
unfortunate consequences.
 
 Understand that bonds may be called. Many bonds, especially corpo-
rate bonds, can legally be called before maturity. This means that the 
bond issuer pays you back early, because it doesn’t need to borrow as 
much money or because interest rates have fallen and the borrower 
wants to reissue new bonds at a lower interest rate. Be especially careful 
about purchasing bonds that were issued at higher interest rates than 
those that currently prevail. Borrowers pay off such bonds first.
 
 Diversify. Invest and hold bonds from a variety of companies in 
different industries to buffer changes in the economy that adversely 
affect one industry or a few industries more than others. Of the money 
that you want to invest in bonds, don’t put more than 5 percent into 
any one bond. That means that you need to hold at least 20 bonds. 
Diversification requires a good chunk of change to invest given the size 
of most bonds and because high fees erode your investment balance if 
you invest too little. If you can’t achieve this level of diversification, use 
a bond mutual fund.
 
 Shop around. Just like when you buy a car, shop around for good 
prices on the bonds that you have in mind. The hard part is doing an 
apples-to-apples comparison because different brokers may not be able 
to offer the same exact bond as other brokers. Remember that the two 
biggest determinants of what a bond should yield are its maturity date 
and its credit rating (both of which I discuss earlier in this chapter).
 
Unless you invest in boring, simple-to-understand bonds such as Treasuries, 
you’re better off investing in bonds via the best bond mutual funds. One 
exception is if you absolutely, positively must receive your principal back on 
a certain date. Because bond funds don’t mature, individual bonds with the 
correct maturity for you may best suit your needs. Consider Treasuries 
because they carry such low default risk. Otherwise, you need a lot of time, 
money, and patience to invest well in individual bonds.
Considering Other Lending Investments
Bonds, money market funds, and bank savings vehicles are hardly the only 
lending investments that exist. A variety of other companies are more than 
willing to have you lend them your money and pay you a relatively fixed rate 
of interest. In most cases, you’re better off staying away from the following 
investments.
 
Too many investors get sucked into lending investments that offer higher 
yields. Always remember: Risk and return go hand in hand. Higher yields mean 
greater risk, and vice versa.

148
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Guaranteed-investment contracts
Insurance companies sell and back guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs). 
The allure of GICs is that your account value doesn’t appear to fluctuate. Like 
a one-year bank certificate of deposit, GICs generally quote you an interest 
rate for the next year. Some GICs lock in the rate for longer periods of time, 
whereas others may change the interest rate several times per year.
The insurance company that issues the GIC actually invests your money, 
mostly in bonds and maybe a bit in stocks. Like other bonds and stocks, 
these investments fluctuate in value — you just don’t see it.
Typically once a year, you receive a new statement that shows that your GIC 
is worth more, thanks to the newly added interest. This statement makes 
otherwise-nervous investors who can’t stand volatile investments feel all 
warm and fuzzy.
The yield on a GIC is usually comparable to those available on shorter-term, 
high-quality bonds. Yet the insurer invests in longer-term bonds and some 
stocks. The difference between what these investments generate for the 
insurer and what the GIC pays you in interest goes to the insurer.
 
The insurer’s take can be significant and is generally hidden. Unlike a mutual 
fund, which is required to report the management fee that it collects and 
subtracts it before paying your return, GIC insurers have no such obligations. 
By having a return guaranteed in advance, you pay heavily — an effective 
fee of 2-plus percent per year — for the peace of mind in the form of lower 
long-term returns.
The high effective fees that you pay to have an insurer manage your money in 
a GIC aren’t the only drawbacks. When you invest in a GIC, your assets are 
part of the insurer’s general assets. Insurance companies sometimes fail, and 
although they often merge with a healthy insurer, you can still lose money. 
The rate of return on GICs from a failed insurance company is often slashed 
to help restore financial soundness to the company. So the only “guarantee” 
that comes with a GIC is that the insurer agrees to pay you the promised rate 
of interest (as long as it is able)!
Private mortgages
In the section “Mortgage bonds,” earlier in this chapter, I discuss investing 
in mortgages that resemble the ones that you take out to purchase a home. 
To directly invest in mortgages, you can loan your money to people who 
need money to buy or refinance real estate. Such loans are known as mort-
gages or second mortgages, in the case where your loan is second in line 
behind someone’s primary mortgage.

149
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments
Private mortgage investments appeal to investors who don’t like the volatility 
of the stock and bond markets and aren’t satisfied with the seemingly low 
returns on bonds or other common lending investments. Private mortgages 
seem to offer the best of both worlds — stock-market-like, 10-plus percent 
returns without volatility.
 
Mortgage and real estate brokers often arrange mortgage investments, so 
you must tread carefully because these people have a vested interest in seeing 
the deal done. Otherwise, the mortgage broker doesn’t get paid for closing 
the loan, and the real estate broker doesn’t get a commission for selling 
a property.
One broker who also happens to write about real estate wrote a newspaper 
column describing mortgages as the “perfect real estate investment” and 
added that mortgages are a “high-yield, low-risk investment.” If that wasn’t 
enough to get you to whip out your checkbook, the writer/broker further 
gushed that mortgages are great investments because you have “little or no 
management, no physical labor.”
You know by now that a low-risk, high-yield investment doesn’t exist. Earning 
a relatively high interest rate goes hand in hand with accepting relatively 
high risk. The risk is that the borrower can default — which leaves you hold-
ing the bag. (In the late mid- to late 2000s, mortgage defaults escalated signifi-
cantly.) More specifically, you can get stuck with a property that you may 
need to foreclose on, and if you don’t hold the first mortgage, you’re not first 
in line with a claim on the property.
The fact that private mortgages are high risk should be obvious when you 
consider why the borrower elects to obtain needed funds privately rather 
than through a bank. Put yourself in the borrower’s shoes. As a property 
buyer or owner, if you can obtain a mortgage through a conventional lender, 
such as a bank, wouldn’t you do so? After all, banks generally give better 
interest rates. If a mortgage broker offers you a deal where you can, for exam-
ple, borrow money at 11 percent when the going bank rate is, say, 7 percent, 
the deal must carry a fair amount of risk.
 
I would avoid these investments. If you really want to invest in such mort-
gages, you must do some time-consuming homework on the borrower’s 
financial situation. A banker doesn’t lend someone money without examining 
a borrower’s assets, liabilities, and monthly expenses, and you shouldn’t 
either. Be careful to check the borrower’s credit, and get a large down pay-
ment (at least 20 percent). The best circumstance in which to be a lender is 
if you sell some of your own real estate and you’re willing to act as the bank 
and provide the financing to the buyer in the form of a first mortgage.
Also recognize that your mortgage investment carries interest rate risk: If 
you need to “sell” it early, you’d have to discount it, perhaps substantially 
if interest rates have increased since you purchased it. Try not to lend so 
much money on one mortgage that it represents more than 5 percent of your 
total investments.

150
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
If you’re willing to lend your money to borrowers who carry a relatively high 
risk of defaulting, consider investing in high-yield (junk) bond mutual funds 
instead. With these funds, you can at least diversify your money across many 
borrowers, and you benefit from the professional review and due diligence 
of the fund management team. You can also consider lending money to 
family members.
Out of sight: Fluctuations of 
mortgages, GICs, and CDs
One of the allures of nonbond lending invest-
ments, such as private mortgages, GICs, and 
CDs, is that they don’t fluctuate in value — at 
least not that you can see. Such investments 
appear safer and less volatile. You can’t watch 
your principal fluctuate in value because you 
can’t look up the value daily, the way you can 
with bonds and stocks.
But the principal values of your mortgage, GIC, 
and CD investments really do fluctuate; you just 
don’t see the fluctuations! As I explain in the 
section “Determining when you get your money 
back: Maturity matters,” earlier in this chapter, 
just as the market value of a bond drops when 
interest rates rise, so does the market value of 
these investments, and for the same reasons. 
At higher interest rates, investors expect a 
discounted price on your fixed-interest rate 
investment because they always have the alter-
native of purchasing a new mortgage, GIC, or 
CD at the higher prevailing rates. Some of these 
investments are actually bought and sold (and 
behave just like bonds) among investors on 
what’s known as a secondary market.
If the normal volatility of a bond’s principal 
value makes you queasy, try not to follow your 
investments so closely!

Mastering Mutual Funds

 Looking at reasons to invest in mutual funds
 Uncovering the secrets of successful fund investing
 Deciding how to allocate your assets
 Finding the best stock, bond, hybrid, and money market funds
A
 mutual fund is simply a big pool of money from lots of typical investors 
that a mutual fund manager uses to buy a bunch of stocks, bonds, 
and/or other assets that meet the fund’s investment criteria. The better 
funds enable you to easily and cost-effectively diversify your investments — 
that is, invest in many different industries and companies. (In the earlier 
chapters of this part of the book, I explain all about stocks, bonds, and other 
common securities. If you understand these securities, you can understand 
mutual funds.)
When you invest in a fund, you buy shares and become a shareholder of the 
fund. Good mutual funds enable you to have some of the best money manag-
ers in the country direct the investment of your money. Because efficient 
funds take most of the hassle and cost out of figuring out which companies 
to invest in, they’re among the finest investment vehicles available today. 
Different types of mutual funds can help you meet various financial goals — 
that’s one reason why investors have more than $12 trillion invested in funds! 
You can use money market funds for something most everybody needs — an 
emergency savings stash of three to six months’ living expenses. Or perhaps 
you’re thinking about saving for a home purchase, retirement, or future 
educational costs. If so, you can consider some stock and bond mutual funds.
 
Too many people plunge in to mutual funds without looking at their overall 
financial situation and, in their haste, often end up paying more taxes 
and overlooking other valuable financial strategies. If you haven’t taken a 
comprehensive look at your personal finances, read Chapter 3 to begin this 
important process.

Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Discovering the Benefits 
of the Best Funds
The best mutual funds are superior investment vehicles for people of all 
economic means and for accomplishing many financial objectives. The 
following sections go over the main reasons for investing in mutual funds 
rather than individual securities.
Professional management
The mutual fund investment company hires a portfolio manager and 
researchers whose full-time jobs are to research and purchase suitable 
investments for the fund. These people screen the universe of investments 
for those that meet the fund’s stated objectives.
Typically, fund managers are graduates of the top business and finance 
schools, where they learned portfolio management and securities valuation 
and selection. Many have additional investing credentials, such as the 
Chartered Financial Analyst’s (CFA) degree. In addition to their educational 
training, the best fund managers typically possess ten or more years of 
experience in analyzing and selecting investments.
For most fund managers and researchers, finding the best investments 
is more than a full-time job. Fund managers do tons of analysis that you 
probably lack the time or expertise to perform. For example, fund managers 
assess company financial statements; interview a company’s managers to 
get a sense of the company’s business strategies and vision; examine compet-
itor strategies; speak with company customers, suppliers, and industry 
consultants; and attend trade shows and read industry periodicals.
 
In short, a mutual fund management team does more research, number 
crunching, and due diligence than you could ever have the energy or expertise 
to do in what little free time you have. Investing in mutual funds frees up time 
for friendships, family relationships, and maybe even your sex life — don’t 
miss the terrific time-saving benefits of fund investing!
Cost efficiency
Mutual funds are a cheaper, more communal way of getting your investment 
work done. When you invest your money in an efficiently managed mutual 

153
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
fund, it likely costs you less than trading individual securities on your own. 
Fund managers can buy and sell securities for a fraction of the cost that 
you pay.
Funds also spread the cost of research over thousands of investors. The 
most efficiently managed mutual funds cost less than 1 percent per year in 
fees. (Bonds and money market funds cost much less — in the neighborhood 
of 0.5 percent per year or less.) Some of the larger and more established 
funds can charge annual fees less than 0.2 percent per year — that’s less than 
a $2 annual charge per $1,000 you invest. Newer exchange-traded funds 
(ETFs) are like index mutual funds (see the section “Buy index funds” later in 
this chapter), except that they trade on a stock exchange and, in the best 
cases, may have a slightly lower management fee than their sibling index 
mutual funds.
Diversification
Diversification is a big attraction for many investors who choose mutual 
funds. Most funds own stocks or bonds from dozens of companies, thus 
diversifying against the risk of bad news from any single company or sector. 
Achieving such diversification on your own is difficult and expensive unless 
you have a few hundred thousand dollars and a great deal of time to invest.
Mutual funds typically invest in 25 to 100 securities or more. Proper diversifi-
cation increases the chances of the fund earning higher returns with less risk.
 
Although most mutual funds are diversified, some aren’t. For example, some 
stock funds invest exclusively in stocks of a single industry (for example, 
healthcare) or country (such as Mexico). I’m not a fan of these funds 
because of the narrowness of their investments and their typically higher 
operating fees.
Reasonable investment minimums
Most funds have low minimum investment requirements. Many funds have 
minimums of $1,000 or less. Retirement account investors can often invest 
with even less. Some funds even offer monthly investment plans, so you can 
start with as little as $50 per month.
 
Even if you have lots of money to invest, you should consider mutual funds. 
Increasing numbers of fund companies offer higher-balance customers special 
funds with lower annual operating expenses and thus even better returns 
(more on these funds later in this chapter).

154
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Different funds for different folks
 
Some people think that mutual funds = stock market investing = risky. That’s 
wrong. The majority of money in mutual funds isn’t in the stock market. You 
may select the funds that take on the kinds of risks that you’re comfortable 
with and that meet your financial goals. Following is a list of the three major 
types of mutual funds:
 
 Stock funds: If you want your money to grow over a long period of time 
(and you can handle down as well as up years), choose funds that invest 
more heavily in stocks.
 
 Bond funds: If you need current income and don’t want investments that 
fluctuate as widely in value as stocks do, consider some bond funds.
 
 Money market funds: If you want to be sure that your invested principal 
doesn’t decline in value because you may need to use your money in the 
short term, select a money market fund.
Most investors (myself included) choose a combination of these three types 
of funds to diversify and help accomplish different financial goals. (I cover 
each type of fund in depth later in this chapter.)
High financial safety
Thousands of banks and insurance companies have failed in recent decades. 
Banks and insurers can fail because their liabilities (the money that custom-
ers give them to invest, which they can be called upon to return on short 
notice) can exceed their assets (the money that they’ve invested or lent). For 
example, when big chunks of a bank’s loans go sour at the same time that 
its depositors want their money, the bank fails, because banks typically 
have less than 15 cents on deposit for every dollar that you and I place with 
them. Likewise, if an insurance company makes several poor investments or 
underestimates the number of insurance policyholder claims, it too can fail.
 
Such failures can’t happen with a mutual fund because the value of the fund’s 
shares fluctuates as the securities in the fund fluctuate in value. For every 
dollar of securities they hold for their customers, mutual funds have a dollar’s 
worth of securities. The worst that can happen with a fund is that if you want 
your money, you may get less cash than you originally put into the fund — but 
you won’t lose all your investment.
For added security, the specific stocks, bonds, and other securities that a 
mutual fund buys are held at a custodian, a separate organization indepen-
dent of the mutual fund company. A custodian ensures that the fund 
management company can’t embezzle your funds or use assets from a 
better-performing fund to subsidize a poor performer.

155
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
Accessibility
What’s really terrific about dealing with mutual funds is that they’re set 
up for people who value their time and don’t like going to a local branch 
office and standing in long lines. With funds, you can fill out a simple form 
(often online, if you wish) and write a check in the comfort of your home 
(or authorize electronic transfers from your bank or other accounts) to make 
your initial investment. You can then typically make subsequent investments 
by mailing in a check or zapping in money electronically.
Additionally, most money market funds offer check-writing privileges. Many 
mutual fund companies also allow you to electronically transfer money back 
and forth from your local bank account; you can access your money almost 
as quickly through a money market fund as you can through your local bank.
Selling shares of your mutual fund is usually simple. Generally, all you need 
to do is call the fund company’s toll-free number or visit its Web site. Some 
companies have representatives available around the clock, year-round. 
Most fund companies also offer online account access and trading capabili-
ties as well (although as I discuss in Chapter 19, some people are prone to 
overtrading online).
The Keys to Successful Fund Investing
This chapter helps explain why funds are a good investment vehicle to 
use, but not all funds are worthy of your investment dollars. Would you, for 
example, invest in a mutual fund run by an inexperienced and unproven 
18-year-old? How about a fund that charges high fees and produces inferior 
returns in comparison to other similar funds? You don’t have to be an invest-
ing wizard to know the correct answers. When you select a fund, you can use 
a number of simple, common-sense criteria to greatly increase your chances 
of investment success. The criteria presented in this section have been 
scientifically proven to dramatically increase your fund investing returns. 
(Visit my Web site www.erictyson.com to see the studies.)
Minimize costs
For a particular type of mutual fund (larger-company, U.S. stock funds, for 
example), hundreds of choices are available. The charges that you pay to buy 
or sell a fund, as well as the ongoing fund operating expenses, can have a big 
impact on the rate of return that you earn on your investments.

156
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
Fund costs are an important factor in the return that you earn from a mutual 
fund because fees are deducted from your investment returns and can attack 
a fund from many angles. All other things being equal, high fees and other 
charges depress your returns.
 
Stick with funds that maintain low total operating expenses and that don’t 
charge sales loads (commissions). Both types of fees come out of your pocket 
and reduce your rate of return. Plenty of excellent funds are available at rea-
sonable annual operating expense ratios (less than 1.0 percent for stock funds; 
less than 0.5 percent for bond funds). See my recommendations in the respec-
tive sections on the best stock mutual funds, bond funds, and money market 
funds, later in this chapter.
Avoid load funds
 
The first such fee that you need to minimize is the sales load, which is a 
commission paid to brokers and “financial planners” who work on commis-
sion and sell mutual funds. Commissions, or loads, generally range from 
4.0 to 8.5 percent of the amount that you invest. Sales loads are an additional 
and unnecessary cost that is deducted from your investment money. You can 
find plenty of outstanding no-load (commission-free) funds.
 
Brokers, being brokers, sing the praises of buying a load fund, warn against 
no-loads, and they even sometimes try to obscure the load. For example, 
brokers may tell you that the commission doesn’t cost you because the 
mutual fund company pays it. Remember that the commission always comes 
out of your investment dollars, regardless of how cleverly some load funds 
and brokers disguise the commission.
Hiding loads
Unfortunately, fund companies have come up 
with craftier ways of hiding sales loads. 
Increasing numbers of brokers and “financial 
planners” sell funds that they call no-loads, but 
these funds aren’t no-loads.
In back-end or deferred sales load funds, the 
commission is hidden, thanks to the different 
classes of shares, known as A, B, C, and D 
classes. Salespeople tell you that as long as you 
stay in a fund for five to seven years, you need 
not pay the back-end sales charge that applies 
when you sell the investment. This claim may be 
true, but it’s also true that these funds pay 
investment salespeople a hefty commission.
The salespeople can receive their commissions 
because the fund company charges you exorbi-
tant continuing operating expenses (which 
are usually at least 1 percent more per year than 
the best funds). So one way or another, they 
get their commissions from your investment 
dollars.

157
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
Brokers also may say that load funds perform better than no-load funds. 
One reason, brokers claim, is that load funds supposedly hire better fund 
managers. Absolutely no relationship exists between paying a sales charge to 
buy a fund and gaining access to better investment managers. Remember 
that the sales commission goes to the selling broker, not to the fund manag-
ers. Objective studies demonstrate time and again that load funds not only 
don’t outperform but, in fact, underperform no-loads. Common sense sug-
gests why — when you factor in the higher commission and the higher 
average ongoing operating expenses charged on load funds, you pay more to 
own a load fund, so your returns are less.
Another problem with commission-driven load fund sellers is the power of 
self-interest. This issue is rarely talked about, but it’s even more important 
than the extra costs that you pay with load funds. When you buy a load 
fund through a salesperson, you miss out on the chance to get holistic advice 
on other personal finance strategies. For example, you may be better off 
paying down your debts or investing in something entirely different from 
a mutual fund. But in my experience, salespeople almost never advise you 
to pay off your credit cards or your mortgage — or to invest through 
your company’s retirement plan or in real estate — instead of buying an 
investment through them.
Some mutual fund companies, such as Fidelity, try to play it both ways 
(because they sell their funds through brokers as well as direct to 
consumers): They sell load as well as no-load funds.
Beware of high operating expenses
In addition to loads, the other costs of owning funds are the ongoing operat-
ing expenses. All mutual funds charge fees as long as you keep your money 
in the fund. The fees pay for the costs of running a fund, such as employees’ 
salaries, marketing, toll-free phone lines, printing and mailing prospectuses 
(legal disclosure of the fund’s operations and fees), and so on.
A mutual fund’s operating expenses are essentially invisible to you because 
they’re deducted from the fund’s share price. Companies charge operating 
expenses on a daily basis, so you don’t need to worry about trying to get 
out of a fund at a particular time of the year before the company deducts 
these fees.
 
Although expenses are invisible to you, their impact on your returns is quite 
real. Expenses are critical on money market mutual funds and bond funds; 
these funds buy securities that are so similar and so efficiently priced in the 
financial markets that most fund managers in a given type of money market or 
bond fund earn quite similar returns before expenses.
With stock funds, expenses may play less of an important role in your fund 
decision. However, don’t forget that over time, stocks have averaged returns 
of about 10 percent per year. So if one stock fund charges 1.5 percent more 

158
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
in operating expenses than another, you give up an extra 15 percent of your 
expected (pre-tax) annual returns (and an even greater portion of your 
after-tax returns).
 
All types of funds with higher operating expenses tend to produce lower rates 
of return on average. Conversely, funds with lower operating costs can more 
easily produce higher returns for you than a comparable type of fund with 
high costs. This effect makes sense because companies deduct operating 
expenses from the returns that your fund generates. Higher expenses mean a 
lower return to you.
Fund companies quote a fund’s operating expenses as a percentage of your 
investment. The percentage represents an annual fee or charge. You can find 
this number in a fund’s prospectus, in the fund expenses section, usually in a 
line that says something like “Total Fund Operating Expenses.” Or you can 
call the mutual fund’s toll-free phone number and ask a representative, or try 
to find the information at the fund company’s Web site. Make sure that a fund 
doesn’t appear to have low expenses simply because it’s temporarily waiving 
them. (You can ask the fund representative or look at the fees in the fund’s 
prospectus to find this information.)
Consider performance and risk
A fund’s historic rate of return or performance is another important factor to 
weigh when you select a mutual fund. Keep in mind, however, as all mutual 
fund materials must tell you, that past performance is no guarantee of future 
results. In fact, many former high-return funds achieved their results only by 
taking on high risk or simply by short-term luck. Funds that assume higher 
risk should produce higher rates of return. But high-risk funds usually decline 
in price faster during major market declines. Thus, a good fund should con-
sistently deliver a favorable rate of return given the level of risk that it takes.
 
A big mistake that many investors make when they choose a mutual fund is 
overemphasizing the importance of past performance numbers. The shorter 
the time period, the greater the danger of misusing high performance as an 
indicator for a good future fund.
Although past performance can be a good sign, high returns for a fund, rela-
tive to its peers, are largely possible only if a fund takes more risk (or if a 
fund manager’s particular investment style happens by luck to come into 
favor for a few years). The danger of taking more risk is that it doesn’t always 
work the way you’d like. The odds are high that you won’t be able to pick 
the next star before it vaults to prominence in the investing sky. You have 
a far greater chance of boarding that star when it’s ready to plummet back 
to Earth.

 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
In fact, if you had invested in the annual, number-one, top-performing stock 
and bond funds over the last 15 years, the majority (more than 75 percent) of 
those top performers subsequently performed worse, over the next 3 to 10 
years, than the average funds in their peer groups!
 
One clever way that mutual funds make themselves look better than other 
comparable funds is to compare themselves to funds that aren’t really 
comparable. The most common ploy is for a fund to invest in riskier types 
of securities and then compare its performance to funds that invest in less 
risky securities. Examine the types of securities that a fund invests in, and 
make sure that the comparison funds or indexes invest in similar securities.
Stick with experience
A great deal of emphasis is placed on who manages a specific mutual 
fund. Although the individual fund manager is important, a manager isn’t 
an island unto himself. The resources and capabilities of the parent 
company are equally, if not more, important. Managers come and go, but 
fund companies don’t.
Different companies maintain different capabilities and levels of expertise 
with different types of funds. Vanguard, for example, is terrific at money 
market, bond, and conservative stock funds, thanks to its low operating 
expenses. Fidelity has significant experience with investing in U.S. stocks.
A fund company gains more or less experience than others, not only from the 
direct management of certain fund types, but also through hiring out. For 
example, some fund families contract with private money management firms 
that possess significant experience. In other cases, private money manage-
ment firms, such as PIMCO, Tweedy Browne, and Dodge & Cox, with long 
histories in private money management offer mutual funds.
Buy index funds
Unlike other mutual funds, in which the portfolio manager and a team of 
analysts scour the market for the best securities, an index fund manager 
simply invests to match the makeup, and thus also the performance, of an 
index such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 index of 500 large U.S. company 
stocks. Index funds are funds that are mostly managed by a computer.
Index funds deliver relatively good returns by keeping expenses low, staying 
invested, and not trying to jump around. Over ten years or more, index 
funds typically outperform about three-quarters of their peers! Most so-called 
actively managed funds can’t overcome the handicap of high operating 

160
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
expenses that pull down their rates of return. Index funds can run with far 
lower operating expenses because significant ongoing research need not be 
conducted to identify companies to invest in.
The average U.S. stock mutual fund, for example, has an operating expense 
ratio of 1.4 percent per year. (Some funds charge expenses as high as 2 per-
cent or more per year.) That being the case, a U.S. stock index fund with an 
expense ratio of just 0.2 percent per year has an advantage of 1.2 percent per 
year over the average fund. A 1.2 percent difference may not seem like much, 
but in fact it is a significant difference. Because stocks tend to return about 
10 percent per year, you end up throwing away about 12 percent of your 
expected (pre-tax) stock fund returns with an “average fund” in terms of 
expenses (and an even greater portion of your post-tax returns).
With actively managed stock funds, a fund manager can make costly mis-
takes, such as not being invested when the market goes up, being too 
aggressive when the market plummets, or just being in the wrong stocks. 
An actively managed fund can easily underperform the overall market index 
that it’s competing against.
 
Don’t overestimate your ability to pick in advance the few elite money 
managers who manage to beat the market averages by a few percentage 
points per year in the long run. Also, don’t overestimate the pros’ ability to 
consistently pick the right stocks. Index funds make sense for a portion of 
your investments, especially when you invest in bonds and larger, more con-
servative stocks, where beating the market is difficult for portfolio managers.
In addition to lower operating expenses, which help boost your returns, 
index mutual funds are tax-friendlier to invest in when you invest outside 
retirement accounts. Mutual fund managers of actively managed portfolios, in 
their attempts to increase returns, buy and sell securities more frequently. 
However, this trading increases a fund’s taxable capital gains distributions 
and reduces a fund’s after-tax return.
 
Vanguard is the largest and best mutual fund provider of index funds because 
it maintains the lowest annual operating fees in the business. Vanguard has all 
types of bond and stock (both U.S. and international) index mutual funds. See 
my recommended-fund sections later in this chapter.
Consider exchange-traded funds
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are relatively new. Although the first one was 
created back in 1993, they’ve gained some traction in recent years (they now 
hold about 5 percent of the total assets of the mutual fund industry).

161
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
ETFs are similar to mutual funds, with the most significant difference being 
that in order to invest, you must buy into an ETF through a stock exchange 
where ETFs trade, just as individual stocks do. Thus, you need a brokerage 
account to invest in ETFs. (See Chapter 9 for general information on selecting 
a brokerage firm.)
ETFs are like index mutual funds in that each ETF generally tracks a major 
market index. (Beware that more and more ETFs are being issued that track 
more narrowly focused indexes such as an industry group or small country.) 
The best ETFs may also have slightly lower operating expenses than the 
lowest-cost index funds. However, you must pay a brokerage fee to buy and 
sell an ETF, and the current market value of the ETF may deviate slightly 
from the underlying market value of the securities in its portfolio.
 
A number of financial advisors are cheerleading for ETFs. In my observation, 
this advocacy is self-serving because such advisors have established invest-
ment management businesses built around ETFs. In one case, Ric Edelman, 
author of The Lies About Money, tells his readers the following:
“The retail mutual fund industry is ripping you off . . . You need to sell all 
your retail mutual funds . . . the fact is that the retail mutual fund industry 
is now flush with liars, crooks, and charlatans. Daily business activities 
include deceit, hidden costs, undisclosed risks, deceptive trade prac-
tices, conflicts of interest, and fundamental violations of trust — all at 
your expense. Since September 2003, the retail mutual fund industry has 
paid out more than $5 billion in fines.”
That sounds pretty awful, doesn’t it? Well, $5 billion in fines is a pittance. 
Consider that the fund industry averaged about $8 trillion under management 
per year, and these fines spanned about a decade’s worth of activity in 
the fund industry. So the $5 billion amounts to just 0.00625 percent of the 
fund industry’s assets under management. The mutual fund industry, like 
any other business or industry (brokerage firms, dentists, insurance firms, 
financial advisors), isn’t perfect. Unlike many industries, the mutual fund 
industry actually returned the $5 billion to investors, thanks to state and 
federal oversight.
To find out more about ETFs, especially as an alternative or complement to 
your mutual fund portfolio, please see the latest edition of my book Mutual 
Funds For Dummies (Wiley).
Creating Your Fund Portfolio
The specific amount that you decide to invest in any of the major types of 
securities is known as asset allocation. Asset allocation simply means that 
you decide what percentage of your investments you place — or allocate — 

162
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
into bonds versus stocks and into international versus U.S. stocks. (Asset 
allocation can also include other assets, such as real estate and small 
business, which are discussed throughout this book.)
When you invest money for the longer term, such as for retirement, you can 
choose among the various types of funds that I discuss in this chapter. Most 
people get a big headache when they try to decide how to spread their 
money across the choices. This section helps you begin cutting through the 
clutter. (I discuss recommended funds for shorter-term goals later in this 
chapter as well.)
Allocating for the long term
Many working folks have time on their side, and they need to use that time to 
make their money grow. You may have two or more decades before you need 
to draw on some portion of your retirement account assets. If some of your 
investments drop a bit over a year or two — or even over five years — the 
value of your investments has plenty of time to recover before you spend the 
money in retirement.
 
Your current age and the number of years until you retire should be the 
biggest factors in your allocation decision. The younger you are and the more 
years you have before retirement, the more comfortable you should be with 
growth-oriented (and more volatile) investments, such as stock funds. (See 
Chapter 2 for the risks and historic returns of different investments.)
Table 8-1 lists guidelines for allocating mutual fund money that you’ve 
earmarked for long-term purposes, such as retirement. You don’t need an 
MBA or PhD to decide your asset allocation — all you need to know is how 
old you are and the level of risk that you desire!
Table 8-1 
Mutual Fund Asset Allocation for the Long Haul
Your Investment Attitude

Allocation (%)

Allocation (%)
Play it safe
= Age
= 100 – age
Middle of the road
= Age – 10
= 110 – age
Aggressive
= Age – 20
= 120 – age
What’s it all mean, you ask? Consider this example: If you’re a conservative 
sort who doesn’t like a lot of risk, but you recognize the value of striving for 
some growth to make your money work harder, you’re a middle-of-the-road 
type. Using Table 8-1, if you’re 35 years old, you may consider putting 25 
percent (35 – 10) into bond funds and 75 percent (110 – 35) into stock funds.

163
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
 
Now divvy up your stock investment money between U.S. and international 
funds. Here’s what portion of your “stock allocation” I recommend investing in 
overseas stocks:
 
 20 percent (for play it safe)
 
 35 percent (for middle-of-the-road)
 
 50 percent (for aggressive)
If, for example, in Table 8-1, the 35-year-old, middle-of-the-road type invests 
75 percent in stocks, she can then invest about 35 percent of the stock 
fund investments (which works out to be around 25 percent of the total) in 
international stock funds.
So here’s what the 35-year-old, middle-of-the-road investor’s portfolio asset 
allocation looks like so far:
Bonds 
25%
U.S. stocks 
50%
International stocks 
25%
Diversifying your stock fund investments
Suppose that your investment allocation decisions suggest that you invest 
50 percent in U.S. stock funds. Which ones do you choose? As I explain in 
the section “Exploring different types of stock funds,” later in this chapter, 
stock funds differ on a number of levels. There are growth-oriented stocks 
and funds, and those that focus on value stocks. Small-, medium-, and large-
company stocks and funds also invest in such stocks. I explain these types of 
stocks and funds later in this chapter. You also need to decide what portion 
you want to invest in index funds (which I discuss in the “Buy index funds” 
section, earlier in the chapter) versus actively managed funds that try to beat 
the market.
 
Generally, it’s a good idea to diversify into different types of funds. You can 
diversify in one of two ways:
 
 Purchase several individual funds, each of which focuses on a 
different style. For example, you can invest in a large-company value 
stock fund and in a small-company growth fund. I find this approach 
somewhat tedious. Granted, it does allow a fund manager to specialize 
and gain greater knowledge about a particular type of stock. But many 
of the best managers invest in more than one narrow range of security.
 
 Invest in a handful of funds (five to ten), each of which covers several 
bases and that together cover them all. Remember, the investment 
delineations are somewhat arbitrary, and most funds do more than 
just one type of investment. For example, a fund may focus on small-
company value stocks but also invest in medium-company stocks, as 
well as in some that are more growth oriented.

164
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
As for how much you should use index versus actively managed funds, it’s 
really a matter of personal taste. If you’re happy knowing that you’ll get the 
market rate of return and that you can’t underperform the market, index your 
entire portfolio. On the other hand, if you enjoy the challenge of trying to 
pick the better managers and want the potential to earn better than the 
market level of returns, don’t use index funds at all. A happy medium is to do 
both. (John Bogle, founder of Vanguard and pioneer of index mutual funds, 
has about half of his money invested in index funds.)
 
If you haven’t experienced the sometimes significant plummets in stock prices 
that occur, you may feel queasy when it next happens and you’ve got a chunk 
of your nest egg in stocks. Be sure to read Chapters 2 and 5 to understand the 
risk in stocks and what you can and can’t do to reduce the volatility of your 
stock holdings.
The Best Stock Mutual Funds
In Chapters 2 and 5, I make the case for investing in stocks (also known as 
equities) to make your money grow. However, stocks sometimes plummet or 
otherwise remain depressed for a few years. Thus, stock mutual funds (also 
known as equity funds), which, as their name suggests, invest in stocks, 
aren’t a place for money that you know you may need to protect in the next 
few years.
 
Stock funds are excellent investment vehicles that reduce your risk, when 
compared to purchasing individual stocks, because they:
 
 Invest in dozens of stocks: Unless you possess a lot of money to 
invest, you’re likely to buy only a handful of stocks. If you end up with 
a lemon in your portfolio, it can devastate your other good choices. If 
such a stock represents 20 percent of your holdings, the rest of your 
stock selections need to increase about 25 percent in value just to get 
you back to even. Stock funds mitigate this risk. For example, if a fund 
holds equal amounts of 50 stocks, and one goes to zero, you lose only 2 
percent of the fund value if the stock was an average holding. Similarly, 
if the fund holds 100 stocks, you lose just 1 percent. Remember that a 
good fund manager is more likely than you to sidestep disasters (see the 
earlier section “Professional management” for details).
 
 Invest in different types of stocks: Some funds invest in stocks of 
different size companies in a variety of industries. Others may hold 
U.S. and international stocks. Different types of stocks (which are 
explained in the upcoming section titled “Exploring different types of 
stock funds”) don’t move in tandem. So if smaller-company stocks get 
beat up, larger-company stocks may fare better. If U.S. stocks are in the 
tank, international stocks may be faring better.

165
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
Making money with stock funds
When you invest in stock mutual funds, you can make money in three ways:
 
 Dividends: As a mutual fund investor, you can choose to receive your 
share of the dividends paid out to the fund as cash or reinvest them in 
purchasing more shares in the fund. Higher-growth companies tend to 
pay lower dividends.
 
 Unless you need the income to live on (if, for example, you’re already 
retired), reinvest your dividends into buying more shares in the 
fund. If you do this outside of a retirement account, keep a record 
of those reinvestments because you need to factor those additional 
purchases into the tax calculations that you make when you sell 
your shares.
 
 Capital gains distributions: When a fund manager sells stocks for more 
than he paid, the resulting profits, known as capital gains, must be 
netted against losses and paid out to the fund’s shareholders. Just as 
with dividends, you can reinvest your capital gains distributions in 
the fund.
 
 Appreciation: The fund manager isn’t going to sell all the stocks that 
have gone up in value. Thus, the price per share of the fund increases to 
reflect the gains in its stock holdings. For you, these profits are on paper 
until you sell the fund and lock them in. Of course, if a fund’s stocks 
decline in value, the share price depreciates.
If you add together dividends, capital gains distributions, and appreciation, 
you arrive at the total return of a fund. Stocks, and the funds that invest in 
them, differ in the dimensions of these three possible returns, particularly 
with respect to dividends, as I explain in Chapter 5.
Exploring different types of stock funds
Stock funds and the stocks that they invest in are usually pigeonholed into 
particular categories, based on the types of stocks that they focus on. 
Categorizing stock funds is often tidier in theory than in practice, though, 
because some funds invest in an eclectic mix of stocks. Don’t get bogged 
down with the names of funds — funds sometimes have misleading names 
and don’t necessarily do what their names imply. The investment strategies 
of the fund and the fund’s typical investments are what matter. The following 
characteristics are what you need to pay attention to:

166
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
 Company size: The first dimension on which a stock fund’s stock selec-
tion differs is based on the size of the company — small, medium, and 
large companies — in which the fund invests. The total market value 
(capitalization) of a company’s outstanding stock defines the categories 
that define the stocks that the fund invests in. (The term capitalization is 
often shortened to “cap,” so you may hear financial-folks tossing around 
terms like large cap and small cap.) These dollar amounts are arbitrary, 
and as stock prices increase over time, investment market analysts have 
moved up their cutoffs:
 
• Small-company stocks, for example, are usually defined as stocks 
of companies that possess total market capitalization of less than 
$2 billion.
 
• Medium-capitalization stocks have market values between 
$2 billion and $10 billion.
 
• Large-capitalization stocks are those of companies with market 
values greater than $10 billion.
 
 Why care about the size of the companies that a fund holds? 
Historically, smaller companies pay lower dividends but appreciate 
more. They have more-volatile share prices but tend to produce slightly 
higher total returns. Larger companies’ stocks tend to pay greater 
dividends and on average are less volatile and produce slightly lower 
total returns than small-company stocks. Medium-size companies’ 
stocks, as you may suspect, fall between the two.
 
 Growth versus value: Stock fund managers and their funds are further 
categorized by whether they invest in growth or value stocks.
 
• Growth stocks have high prices in relation to the company’s assets, 
profits, and potential profits. Growth companies typically experi-
ence rapidly expanding revenues and profits. These companies 
tend to reinvest most of their earnings in the company to fuel 
future expansion; thus, these stocks pay low dividends. For exam-
ple, eBay pays no dividends and reinvests most of its profits in its 
business.
 
• Value stocks are priced cheaply in relation to the company’s assets, 
profits, and potential profits. Value stocks tend to pay higher divi-
dends than growth stocks and historically have actually produced 
higher total returns than growth stocks.
 
 Mutual fund companies sometimes use other terms to describe 
other types of stock funds. Aggressive growth funds tend to invest 
in the most growth-oriented companies and may undertake 
riskier investment practices, such as frequent trading. Growth and 
income funds tend to invest in stocks that pay higher-than-average 
dividends, thus offering the investor the potential for growth and 
income. Income funds tend to invest more in higher-yielding stocks. 
Bonds usually make up the other portion of income funds.

167
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
 
 Company location: Stocks and the companies that issue them are also 
divvied up based upon the location of their main operations and head-
quarters. Funds that specialize in U.S. stocks are, not surprisingly, called 
U.S. stock funds; those focusing overseas are typically called international 
or overseas funds.
Putting together two or three of these major classifications, you can start to 
comprehend all those silly and lengthy names that mutual funds give their 
stock funds. You can have funds that focus on large-company value stocks or 
small-company growth stocks. You can add in U.S., international, and world-
wide funds to further subdivide these categories into more fund types. So 
you can have international stock funds that focus on small-company stocks 
or growth stocks.
You can purchase several stock funds, each focusing on a different type of 
stock, to diversify into different types of stocks. Two potential advantages 
result from doing so:
 
 First, not all your money rides in one stock fund and with one fund 
manager.
 
 Second, each of the different fund managers can look at and track 
particular stock investment possibilities.
Using the selection criteria I outline in the section “The Keys to Successful 
Fund Investing,” earlier in this chapter, the following sections describe the 
best stock funds that are worthy of your consideration. The funds differ 
primarily in terms of the types of stocks that they invest in. Keep in mind as 
you read through these funds that they also differ in their tax-friendliness 
(see Chapter 3). If you invest inside a retirement account, you don’t need to 
worry about tax-friendliness.
U.S. stock funds
Of all the different types of funds offered, U.S. stock funds are the largest 
category. Stock funds differ mainly in terms of the size of the companies that 
they invest in and in whether the funds focus on growth or value companies. 
Some funds do all these things, and some funds may even invest a bit 
overseas.
 
The only way to know for sure where a fund currently invests (or where the 
fund may invest in the future) is to ask. You can call the mutual fund company 
that you’re interested in to start your information search or visit its Web site. 
You can also read the fund’s annual report. Don’t waste your time looking for 
this information in the fund’s prospectus because it doesn’t give you anything 
beyond general parameters that guide the range of investments. The prospec-
tus doesn’t tell you what the fund currently invests in or has invested in.

168
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
For mutual funds that you hold outside of retirement accounts, you owe 
current income tax on distributed dividends and capital gains. As I discuss in 
Chapter 3, long-term capital gains and stock dividends are taxed at lower 
rates than ordinary income and other investment income.
 
Here’s my short list of U.S. stock funds:
 
 Dodge & Cox Stock
 
 Fairholme Fund
 
 Fidelity Disciplined Equity, Fidelity Low Priced Stock, and Fidelity Value
 
 Masters’ Select Equity, Smaller Companies, and Value
 
 T. Rowe Price Spectrum Growth (holds some foreign stocks)
 
 Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, Primecap, Selected Value, Tax-
Managed Capital Appreciation, and Tax-Managed Small Capitalization
International stock funds
For diversification and growth potential, you should include stock funds that 
invest overseas as part of your portfolio. Normally, you can tell that you’re 
looking at a fund that focuses its investments overseas if its name contains 
words such as international (foreign only), global (foreign and U.S.), or 
worldwide (foreign and U.S.).
 
As a general rule, avoid foreign funds that invest in just one country, regard-
less of whether that country is Australia, Zimbabwe, or anywhere in between. 
As with investing in a sector fund that specializes in a particular industry (see 
the following section), this lack of diversification defeats the whole purpose of 
investing in funds. Funds that focus on specific regions, such as Southeast 
Asia, are better but still generally problematic because of poor diversification 
and higher expenses than other, more-diversified international funds.
If you want to invest in more geographically limiting international funds, take 
a look at T. Rowe Price’s and Vanguard’s offerings, which invest in broader 
regions, such as investing just in Europe, Asia, and the volatile but higher-
growth-potential emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America.
In addition to the risks normally inherent with stock fund investing, changes 
in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar cause price 
changes in the international securities. A decline in the value of the U.S. 
dollar helps the value of foreign stock funds (and conversely, a rising dollar 
versus other currencies can reduce the value of foreign stocks). Some foreign 
stock funds hedge against currency changes. Although this hedging helps 
reduce volatility a bit, it does cost money.

169
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
 
Here are my picks for diversified international funds:
 
 Artisan International
 
 Dodge & Cox International
 
 Harbor International
 
 Masters’ Select International Equity
 
 Oakmark International and Global (holds some U.S. stocks)
 
 TIAA-CREF International Equity
 
 Tweedy Browne Global Value (invests in the U.S. as well)
 
 Vanguard Global Equity (invests in the U.S. too), International Growth, 
Tax-Managed International, and Total International Stock Index
Sector funds
 
Sector funds invest in securities in specific industries. In most cases, you 
should avoid sector funds for a number of reasons, including the following:
 
 Lack of diversification: Investing in stocks of a single industry defeats 
a major purpose of investing in mutual funds — you give up the benefits 
of diversification. Also, even if you’re lucky enough to jump into a sector 
fund just before it becomes “hot,” you can’t assume that the fund will 
pick the right securities within that sector.
 
 High fees: They tend to carry much higher fees than other mutual funds.
 
 Taxable distributions: Many sector funds have high rates of trading or 
turnover of their investment holdings. Investors who use these funds 
outside of retirement accounts have to pay the tax man for the likely 
greater taxable distributions that this trading produces.
The only types of specialty funds that may make sense for a small portion 
(10 percent or less) of your entire investment portfolio are funds that invest 
in real estate or precious metals. These funds can help diversify your portfo-
lio because they can perform better during times of higher inflation — which 
often depresses bond and stock prices. (However, you can comfortably skip 
these funds because diversified stock funds tend to hold some of the same 
stocks as these specialty funds.) Here are some details about these two spe-
cialty fund types:
 
 Real estate funds: Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are stocks of 
companies that invest in real estate. REITs typically invest in properties 
such as apartment buildings, shopping centers, and other rental proper-
ties. REITs allow you to invest in real estate without the hassle of being a 
landlord. Just as it’s a hassle to evaluate REIT stocks, you can always 
invest in a mutual fund of REITs.

Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
 REITs usually pay healthy levels of dividends, which, unlike stock 
dividends, are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. As such, they’re not 
appropriate for people in a higher tax bracket who invest money outside 
of retirement accounts. Some good no-load REIT funds include Fidelity 
Real Estate, Vanguard REIT Index, and Cohen & Steers Realty Shares. 
(You can purchase the latter fund with a lower minimum initial 
investment through discount brokers.)
 
 Precious metals: If you expect high inflation, consider a gold fund. But 
know that these funds swing wildly in value and aren’t for the faint of 
heart; over the long term, such funds provide lousy returns — on about 
par with increases in the cost of living. A good precious-metals fund is 
the Vanguard Precious Metals Fund (while this fund is closed to most 
investors, an alternative fund is USAA Precious Metals).
 
 Don’t buy bullion itself; storage costs and the concerns over whether 
you’re dealing with a reputable company make buying gold bars a pain. 
Also avoid futures and options, which are gambles on short-term price 
movements (see Chapter 1 for more information).
The Best Bond Funds
Bond funds can make you money in the same three ways that a stock fund 
can — dividends, capital gains distributions, and appreciation. However, 
most of the time, the bulk of your return in a bond fund comes from 
dividends.
 
Although an overwhelming number of bond fund choices exists (thousands, in 
fact), not that many remain after you eliminate high-cost funds (those with 
loads and high ongoing fees), low-performance funds (which are often the 
high-cost funds), and funds managed by fund companies and fund managers 
with minimal experience investing in bonds. Here are the aspects to consider 
when choosing bond funds:
 
 Length to maturity: Bond fund objectives and names usually fit one of 
three maturity categories — short-, intermediate-, and long-term. You 
can earn a higher yield from investing in a bond fund that holds longer-
term bonds, but as I explain in Chapter 7, such bond prices are more 
sensitive to changes in interest rates.
 
 Quality: Generally speaking, the lower their issuer’s credit rating, the 
riskier the bond. As with the risk associated with longer maturities, a 
fund that holds lower-quality bonds should provide higher returns for 
the increased risk you take. A higher yield is the bond market’s way of 
compensating you for taking greater risk. Funds holding higher-quality 
bonds provide lower returns but more security.

171
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
 
 Loads and fees: After you settle on the type of bonds that you want, a 
bond fund’s costs — its sales commissions and annual operating fees — 
are a huge consideration. Stick with no-load funds that maintain lower 
annual operating expenses.
 
 Tax implications: Pay attention to the taxability of the dividends that 
bonds pay. If you’re investing in bonds inside of retirement accounts, 
you want taxable bonds. If you invest in bonds outside of retirement 
accounts, the choice between taxable versus tax-free depends on your 
tax bracket (see Chapter 3).
Invest in bond funds only if you have sufficient money in an emergency 
reserve. If you invest money for longer-term purposes, particularly retire-
ment, you need to come up with an overall plan for allocating your money 
among a variety of different funds, including bond funds. (See the section 
“Allocating for the long term,” earlier in this chapter.)
Avoiding yield-related missteps
When selecting bond funds to invest in, investors are often led astray as to 
how much they can expect to make. The first mistake is to look at recent 
performance and assume that you’ll get that return in the future. Investing in 
bond funds based on recent performance is tempting right after a period 
where interest rates have declined (1990s and early 2000s), because declines 
in interest rates pump up bond prices and, therefore, bond fund total returns. 
Remember that an equal but opposite force waits to counteract pumped-up 
bond returns — bond prices fall when interest rates rise.
Don’t get me wrong: Past performance is an important issue to consider. In 
order for performance numbers to be meaningful and useful, you must com-
pare bond funds that are comparable (such as intermediate-term funds that 
invest exclusively in high-grade corporate bonds).
Bond mutual funds calculate their yield after subtracting their operating 
expenses. When you contact a mutual fund company seeking a fund’s current 
yield, make sure that you understand what time period the yield covers. Fund 
companies are supposed to give you the SEC yield, which is a standard yield 
calculation that allows for fairer comparisons among bond funds. The SEC 
yield reflects the bond fund’s yield to maturity. The SEC yield is the best yield 
to use when you compare funds because it captures the effective rate of 
interest that an investor can receive in the future.
 
Unfortunately, if you select bond funds based on advertised yield, you’re 
almost guaranteed to purchase the wrong bond funds. Bond funds and the 
mutual fund companies that sell them can play more than a few games to 
fatten a fund’s yield. Such sleights of hand make a fund’s marketing and adver-
tising departments happy because higher yields make it easier for salespeople 
and funds to hawk their bond funds. But remember that yield-enhancing 
shenanigans can leave you poorer. Here’s what you need to watch out for:

172
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
 Lower quality: In comparing one short-term bond fund to another, 
you may discover that one pays 0.5 percent more and decide that it 
looks better. However, it turns out that the higher-yielding fund invests 
20 percent of its money in junk (non-investment grade) bonds, whereas 
the other fund fully invests in high-quality bonds.
 
 Longer maturities: Bond funds can usually increase their yield just by 
increasing their maturity a bit. If one long-term bond fund invests in 
bonds that mature in an average of 17 years, and another fund has an 
average maturity of 12 years, comparing the two is a classic case of 
comparing apples and oranges.
 
 Giving your money back without you knowing it: Some funds return 
a portion of your principal in the form of dividends. This move artifi-
cially pumps up a fund’s yield but depresses its total return. When you 
compare bond funds, make sure that you compare their total return 
over time (in addition to making sure that the funds have comparable 
portfolios of bonds).
 
 Waiving of expenses: Some bond funds, particularly newer ones, waive 
a portion or even all their operating expenses to temporarily inflate the 
fund’s yield. Yes, you can invest in a fund that has a sale on its operating 
fees, but you’d also buy yourself the bother of monitoring things to 
determine when the sale is over. Bond funds that engage in this practice 
often end sales quietly when the bond market is performing well. Don’t 
forget that if you sell a bond fund (held outside of a retirement account) 
that has appreciated in value, you owe taxes on your profits.
Treading carefully with actively 
managed bond funds
Some bond funds are aggressively managed. Managers of these funds possess 
a fair degree of latitude to purchase and trade bonds that they think will per-
form best in the future. For example, if a fund manager thinks interest rates 
will rise, she usually buys shorter-term bonds and keeps more of a fund’s 
assets in cash. The fund manager may invest more in lower-credit-quality 
bonds if she thinks that the economy is improving and that more companies 
will prosper and improve their credit standing.
 
Aggressively managed funds are a gamble. If interest rates fall instead of rise, 
the fund manager who moved into shorter-term bonds and cash suffers worse 
performance. If interest rates fall because the economy sinks into recession, 
the lower-credit-quality bonds will likely suffer from a higher default rate and 
depress the fund’s performance even further.
Some people think the “experts” have no trouble predicting which way 
interest rates or the economy is heading. The truth is that economic predic-
tions are always difficult, and the experts are often wrong. Few bond fund 

173
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
managers have been able to beat a buy-and-hold approach. However, William 
Gross, who manages the PIMCO and Harbor bond funds, is one fund manager 
who has pretty consistently beaten the market averages.
But remember that trying to beat the market can lead to getting beaten! 
Increasing numbers of examples have occurred in recent years of bond funds 
falling on their faces after risky investing strategies backfire. Interestingly, 
bond funds that charge sales commissions (loads) and higher ongoing oper-
ating fees are the ones that are more likely to blow up, perhaps because 
these fund managers are under more pressure to pump up returns to make 
up for higher operating fees.
 
It’s fine to invest some of your bond fund money in funds that try to hold the 
best position for changes in the economy and interest rates, but remember 
that if these fund managers are wrong, you can lose more money. Over the 
long term, you’ll probably do best with efficiently managed funds that stick 
with an investment objective and that don’t try to time and predict the bond 
market. Index funds that invest in a relatively fixed basket of bonds so as to 
track a market index of bond prices are a good example of this passive 
approach.
Short-term bond funds
Of all bond funds, short-term bond funds are the least sensitive to interest 
rate fluctuations. The stability of short-term bond funds makes them appro-
priate investments for money that you seek a better rate of return on than a 
money market fund can produce for you. But with short-term bond funds, 
you also have to tolerate the risk of losing a percent or two in principal value 
if interest rates rise.
 
Short-term bonds work well for money that you earmark for use in a few years, 
such as the purchase of a home or a car, or for money that you plan to with-
draw from your retirement account in the near future.
Taxable, short-term bond funds
 
Consider bond funds that pay taxable dividends when you’re not in a high tax 
bracket and for investing inside of retirement accounts. My favorite is the 
Vanguard Short-Term Investment Grade Portfolio.
Important note: Many of the Vanguard funds recommended in this chapter 
offer “Admiral” versions that have even lower operating fees for customers 
investing at least $100,000 (or $50,000, if the account has been in existence 
for at least ten years).

174
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
U.S. Treasury short-term bond funds
 
U.S. Treasury bond funds may be appropriate if you prefer a bond fund that 
invests in U.S. Treasuries (which possess the safety of government backing; 
see Chapter 7 for details) or if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but you 
are in a high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher). Vanguard Short-Term 
Treasury is a good choice.
I don’t recommend Treasuries for retirement accounts because they pay less 
interest than fully taxable bond funds.
Federally tax-free short-term bond funds
 
State and federally tax-free short-term bond funds are scarce. If you want 
shorter-term bonds, and if you’re in a high federal bracket but in a low state 
bracket (less than 5 percent), consider investing in these federally tax-free 
bond funds (whose dividends are state taxable):
 
 Vanguard Short-Term Tax-Exempt
 
 Vanguard Limited-Term Tax-Exempt
If you live in a state with high taxes, also consider checking out the state- and 
federal-tax-free intermediate-term bond funds (which I discuss in the next 
section) — if you can withstand their volatility. Another option is to use a 
state money market fund, covered later in this chapter in “The Best Money 
Market Funds.”
Intermediate-term bond funds
Intermediate-term bond funds hold bonds that typically mature in a decade 
or so. They’re more volatile than shorter-term bonds but can also prove 
more rewarding. The longer you own an intermediate-term bond fund, 
the more likely you are to earn a higher return on it than on a short-term 
fund unless interest rates continue to rise over many years.
 
As an absolute minimum, don’t purchase an intermediate-term fund unless 
you expect to hold it for three to five years — or even longer, if you can. 
Therefore, you need to make sure that the money that you put into an 
immediate-term fund is money that you don’t expect to use in the near future.
Taxable intermediate-term bond funds
 
Taxable intermediate-term bond funds to consider include the following:
 
 Dodge & Cox Income
 
 Harbor Bond
 
 Vanguard GNMA, High Yield Corporate, and Total Bond Market Index

175
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
U.S. Treasury intermediate-term bond funds
Consider U.S. Treasury bond funds if you prefer a bond fund that invests in 
U.S. Treasuries (which maintain the safety of government backing) or if 
you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but you are in a high state tax bracket 
(5 percent or higher). I don’t recommend Treasuries for retirement accounts 
because they pay less interest than fully taxable bond funds.
 
A couple of my favorites are Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities and 
Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury.
Federally tax-free intermediate-term bond funds
You should consider federally tax-free bond funds if you’re in a high federal 
bracket but a relatively low state bracket (less than 5 percent).
 
A few good ones include the following:
 
 Fidelity Intermediate Municipal Income
 
 Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt
If you’re in high federal and state tax brackets, refer to the state and federally 
tax-free bonds that I mention later in this chapter.
Long-term bond funds
Long-term bond funds are the most aggressive and volatile bond funds 
around. If interest rates on long-term bonds increase substantially, you can 
easily see the principal value of your investment decline 10 percent or 
more. (See the discussion in Chapter 7 of how interest rate changes impact 
bond prices.)
 
Long-term bond funds are generally used for retirement investing in one of 
two situations:
 
 Investors don’t expect to tap their investment money for a decade or 
more.
 
 Investors want to maximize current dividend income and are willing to 
tolerate volatility.
Don’t use these funds to invest money that you plan to use within the next 
five years, because a bond market drop can leave your portfolio short of your 
monetary goal.

176
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Taxable long-term bond funds
 
I have just one favorite taxable bond fund that holds longer-term bonds. 
Can you guess which fund company offers it? If you guessed Vanguard, you’re 
correct — the Vanguard Long-Term Investment Grade bond fund.
U.S. Treasury long-term bond funds
U.S. Treasury bond funds may be advantageous if you want a bond fund that 
invests in U.S. Treasuries or if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but you 
are in a high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher). I recommend Treasuries 
for non-retirement accounts only because Treasuries pay less interest than 
fully taxable bond funds.
 
I recommend the Vanguard Long-Term Treasury fund.
Federally tax-free long-term bond funds
 
Municipal (federally tax-free) long-term bond funds that I recommend 
include Vanguard Long-Term Tax-Exempt and Vanguard Insured Long-Term 
Tax-Exempt.
State and federally tax-free long-term bond funds
 
State and federally tax-free bond funds may be appropriate when you’re in 
high federal and high state (5 percent or higher) tax brackets. Fidelity, T. Rowe 
Price, and Vanguard offer good funds for a number of states. If you can’t find a 
good, state-specific fund for your state, or if you’re only in a high federal tax 
bracket, you can use the nationwide Vanguard Municipal bond funds.
The Best Hybrid Funds
Hybrid funds invest in a mixture of different types of securities. Most com-
monly, they invest in both bonds and stocks. These funds are usually less 
risky and less volatile than funds that invest exclusively in stocks; in an eco-
nomic downturn, bonds usually hold value better than stocks.
 
Hybrid funds make it easier for investors who are skittish about investing in 
stocks to hold stocks because they reduce the volatility that normally comes 
with pure stock funds. Because of their extensive diversification, hybrid 
funds are excellent choices for an investor who doesn’t have much money 
to start with.
Hybrid funds come in two forms:

177
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
 
 Balanced funds generally try to maintain a fairly constant percentage of 
investment in stocks and bonds.
 
 Asset allocation funds, by contrast, normally adjust the mix of different 
investments according to the portfolio manager’s expectations. Some 
asset allocation funds, however, tend to keep more of a fixed mix of 
stocks and bonds, whereas some balanced funds shift the mix around 
quite frequently. (Although the concept of a manager being in the right 
place at the right time and beating the market averages sounds good in 
theory, most funds that shift assets fail to outperform a buy-and-hold 
approach.)
 
Because hybrid funds pay decent dividends from the bonds that they hold, 
they’re not appropriate for some investors who purchase funds outside tax-
sheltered retirement accounts. If you’re in a higher tax bracket, you should 
consider tax-free bonds (see Chapter 7). With the exception of the Vanguard 
Tax-Managed Balanced Fund, which holds federally tax-free bonds, avoid 
hybrid funds if you’re in a higher tax bracket. You should consider buying 
separate tax-friendly stock funds and tax-free bond funds (both discussed 
earlier in this chapter) to create your own hybrid portfolio.
 
Here’s my recommended short list of great balanced-type mutual funds:
 
 Dodge & Cox Balanced
 
 Fidelity Freedom Funds and Fidelity Puritan
 
 TIAA-CREF Managed Allocation
 
 T. Rowe Price Balanced
 
 Vanguard LifeStrategy funds, Wellesley Income, and Wellington
The Best Money Market Funds
As I explain in Chapter 7, money market funds are a safe, higher-yielding 
alternative to bank accounts. (If you’re in a higher tax bracket, money market 
funds have even more appeal because you can get tax-free versions of money 
market funds.) Under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, 
money market funds can invest only in the highest-credit-rated securities, 
and their investments must have an average maturity of less than 90 days. 
The short-term nature of these securities effectively eliminates the risk of 
money market funds being sensitive to changes in interest rates.
The securities that money market funds use are extremely safe. General-
purpose money market funds invest in government-backed securities, bank 
certificates of deposit, and short-term corporate debt that the largest and 
most creditworthy companies and the U.S. government issue.

178
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
When shopping for a money fund, consider these factors:
 
 Expenses: Within a given category of money market funds (general, 
Treasury, municipal, and so on), money market fund managers invest in 
the same basic securities. The market for these securities is pretty darn 
efficient, so “superstar” money market fund managers may eke out an 
extra 0.1 percent per year in yield, but not much more.
 
 Select a money market fund that does a good job controlling its 
expenses. The operating expenses that the fund deducts before payment 
of dividends are the biggest determinant of yield. All other things being 
equal (which they usually are with different money market funds), lower 
operating expenses translate into higher yields for you.
 
 You have no need or reason to tolerate annual operating expenses 
of greater than 0.5 percent. Some top-quality funds charge a third of 
1 percent or less annually. Remember, lower expenses don’t mean that 
a fund company cuts corners or provides poor service. Lower expenses 
are possible in most cases because a fund company is successful in 
attracting a lot of money to invest.
 
 Tax consequences: With money market funds, all your return comes 
from dividends. What you actually get to keep of these returns (on non-
retirement account investments) is what is left over after the federal and 
state governments take their cut of your investment income. If you 
invest money that’s held outside of a retirement account, and you’re in a 
high tax bracket, you may come out ahead if you invest in tax-free 
money market funds. If you’re in a high-tax state, a state money market 
fund, if good ones exist for your state, may be a sound move.
 
 Tax-free refers to the taxability of the dividends that the fund pays. You 
don’t get a tax deduction for money that you put into the fund, as you do 
with 401(k) or other retirement-type accounts.
 
 Location of other funds: Consider what other investing you plan to do 
at the fund company where you establish a money market fund. Suppose 
that you decide to make mutual fund investments in stocks and bonds 
at T. Rowe Price. Then keeping a money market fund at a different firm 
that offers a slightly higher yield may not be worth the time and admin-
istrative hassle, especially if you don’t plan on keeping much cash in 
your money market fund.
 
 Associated services: Good money market funds offer other useful ser-
vices, such as free check writing, telephone exchange and redemptions, 
and automated electronic exchange services with your bank account.
Most mutual fund companies don’t have many local branch offices. Generally, 
this fact helps fund companies keep their expenses low so they can pay 
you greater money market fund yields. You may open and maintain your 
mutual fund account via the fund’s toll-free phone lines, the mail, or the com-
pany’s Web site. You don’t really get much benefit, except psychological, if 
you select a fund company with an office in your area. But I don’t want to 
diminish the importance of your emotional comfort level.

179
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
Using the criteria that I just discussed, I recommend in this section the best 
money market funds — those that offer competitive yields, check writing, 
access to other excellent mutual funds, and other commonly needed money 
market services.
Taxable money market funds
Money market funds that pay taxable dividends may be appropriate for 
retirement account funds that await investment as well as non-retirement 
account money when you’re not in a high federal tax bracket and aren’t in a 
high state tax bracket (less than 5 percent).
 
Here are the best taxable money market funds to consider:
 
 Fidelity Cash Reserves and Spartan Money Market (higher yields if you 
invest $25,000)
 
 T. Rowe Price Summit Cash Reserves (higher yields if you invest $25,000)
 
 Vanguard’s Prime Money Market
U.S. Treasury money market funds
Consider U.S. Treasury money market funds if you prefer a money market 
fund that invests in U.S. Treasuries, which maintain the safety of government 
backing, or if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but are in a high state 
tax bracket (5 percent or higher).
 
The following lists U.S. Treasury funds that I recommend:
 
 Fidelity’s Government Money Market ($25,000 minimum)
 
 USAA’s Treasury Money Market
 
 Vanguard Treasury Money Market (Admiral fund offers a higher yield if 
you have $50,000 to invest)
Municipal money market funds
Municipal (also known as muni) money market funds invest in short-term 
debt that state and local governments issue. A municipal money market fund, 
which pays you federally tax-free dividends, invests in munis issued by state 
and local governments throughout the country. A state-specific municipal 
fund invests in state and local government-issued munis for one state, such 
as New York. So if you live in New York and buy a New York municipal fund, 
the dividends on that fund are federal and New York state tax-free.

180
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
So how do you decide whether to buy a nationwide or state-specific munici-
pal money market fund? Federally tax-free-only money market funds may be 
appropriate when you’re in a high federal but not a high state bracket (less 
than 5 percent).
 
If you’re in a higher state tax bracket, your state may not have good (or any) 
state tax-free money market funds available. If you live in any of those states, 
you’re likely best off with one of the following national money market funds:
 
 T. Rowe Price Summit Municipal Money Market ($25,000 minimum)
 
 USAA Tax-Exempt Money Market
 
 Vanguard Tax-Exempt Money Market
State tax-free money market funds are worth considering when you’re in a 
high federal and a high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher). Fidelity, USAA, 
and Vanguard have good funds for a number of states. If you can’t find a 
good, state-specific fund for your state, or you’re only in a high federal tax 
bracket, remember that you need to use one of the nationwide muni money 
markets that I describe in the previous list.

Chapter 9
Choosing a Brokerage Firm
In This Chapter
 Understanding the different types of brokerage firms
 Shopping for a discount broker
 Surfing for an online broker
You can invest in most securities — such as the stocks and bonds that I 
discuss in Chapters 4 through 7 — on your own, without using a broker 
if you buy mutual funds direct from fund providers. But someday, you may 
need brokerage services. Brokers execute your trades to buy or sell stocks, 
bonds, and other securities.
Consider setting up a brokerage account for one or more of the following 
reasons:
 
 If you hold or invest in individual stocks and bonds
 
 If you seek to invest in and hold mutual funds from a variety of fund 
companies through a single account
 
 If you want to invest in newer exchange-traded funds (see Chapter 8)
 
 If you desire to have an account with unlimited check writing (possibly 
as a replacement to a local checking account)
In this chapter, I explain the ins and outs of discount brokers and online 
brokers to help you find the right broker for your investment needs.
Getting Your Money’s Worth: 
Discount Brokers
Prior to 1975, all securities brokerage firms charged the same fee, known 
as a commission, to trade stocks and bonds. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), the federal government agency responsible for 
overseeing investment firms and their services, regulated commissions.

182
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Beginning May 1, 1975 — known in the brokerage business as “May Day” — 
brokerage firms were free to compete with one another on price, like compa-
nies in almost all other industries. Most of the firms in existence at that 
time, such as Prudential, Merrill Lynch, E.F. Hutton, and Smith Barney, largely 
continued with business as usual, charging relatively high commissions.
However, a new type of brokerage firm, the discount broker, was born. 
Discount brokerage firms charge substantially lower commissions — 
typically 50 to 75 percent lower — than the other firms. Today, discount 
brokers, which include many online brokers, abound and continue to 
capture the lion’s share of new business.
 
When you hear the word discount, you probably think of adjectives like cheap, 
inferior quality, and such. However, when it comes to the securities brokerage 
field, the discount brokers who place your trades at substantial discounts 
can offer you even better value and service than high-cost brokers. The follow-
ing list offers some of the reasons why discount brokers give you more bang 
for your buck:
 
 Discount brokers can place your trades at a substantially lower price 
because they have much lower overhead.
 
 Discount brokers tend not to rent the posh downtown office space, 
complete with mahogany-paneled conference rooms, in order to impress 
customers.
 
 Discounters don’t waste tons of money employing economists and 
research analysts to produce forecasts and predictive reports.
In addition to lower commissions, another major benefit of using discount 
brokers is that they generally work on salary. Working on salary removes a 
significant conflict of interest that continues to get commission-paid brokers 
and firms such as Prudential, Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan 
Stanley into trouble. Although many of these firms today claim to offer finan-
cial planning, the reality is that commission-paid brokers aren’t any different 
from other salespeople, whether the product is cars, copy machines, or 
computers. People who sell on commission to make a living aren’t inherently 
evil, but given the financial incentives they have, don’t expect to receive 
holistic, in-your-best-interest investing counsel from them.
Ignoring the salespeople’s arguments
 
One of the many sales tactics of high-commission brokerage firms is to try to 
disparage discounters by saying things such as “You’ll receive poor service 
from discounters.” My own experience, as well as that of others, suggests that 
in many cases, discounters actually offer better service.

183
 Chapter 9: Choosing a Brokerage Firm
Many of the larger discounters with convenient branch offices offer help that 
includes assistance with filling out paperwork and access to independent 
research reports. And as I discuss in Chapter 8, you can buy no-load 
(commission-free) mutual funds that are run by management teams that 
make investment decisions for you. Such funds can be bought from mutual 
fund companies as well as through many discount brokerage firms.
High-commission firms used to argue that discount brokerage customers 
received worse trade prices when they bought and sold. This assertion is a 
bogus argument because all brokerage firms use a computer-based trading 
system for smaller retail trades. Trades are processed in seconds. High-
commission brokers also say that discounters are only “for people who 
know exactly what they’re doing and don’t need any help.” This statement 
is also false.
Selecting a discount broker
Which discount broker is best for you depends on what your needs and 
wants are. In addition to fees, consider how important having a local branch 
office is to you. If you seek to invest in mutual funds, the discount brokerage 
firms that I list later in this section offer access to good funds. In addition, 
these firms offer money market funds into which you can deposit money 
awaiting investment or proceeds from a sale.
Within the discount brokerage business, deep discounters are known as firms 
that offer the lowest rates but fewer frills and other services. Generally, deep 
discounters don’t have local branch offices like big discounters do or offer 
money market funds with the highest yields.
 
Be careful of some deep discounters that offer bargain commissions but stick 
it to you in other ways, such as high fees for particular services or below-
market interest rates on money awaiting investment.
 
Here are my top picks for discount brokers:
 
 T. Rowe Price (800-225-5132; www.troweprice.com): T. Rowe Price 
offers a solid family of no-load mutual funds that you can also purchase 
through its discount brokerage division. The company’s brokerage fees 
are competitive and among those on the lower end for discounters. Its 
14 branch offices are scattered along the East Coast, California, 
Colorado, and Illinois.
 
 Vanguard (800-992-8327; www.vanguard.com): Vanguard is best 
known for its excellent family of no-load mutual funds, but its discount 
brokerage services have improved over the years. Vanguard has also 
reduced its brokerage fees in recent years, and its prices are now near 
the low end of discount brokers.

184
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
 TD Ameritrade (800-934-4448; www.tdameritrade.com): This firm was 
created by the merger of TD Waterhouse with Ameritrade. (Waterhouse 
Securities merged in the late 1990s with Jack White and company to 
form TD Waterhouse.) TD Ameritrade offers competitive commission 
rates and more than 100 branch offices. The company offers ’round-the-
clock customer assistance.
All the preceding firms offer mutual funds from many fund companies in 
addition to their family of funds (if they have a family of funds). In other 
words, you may purchase non-T. Rowe Price mutual funds through T. Rowe 
Price’s brokerage department. There are certainly other discounters with 
good service and competitive rates, such as Muriel Siebert, so shop around if 
you desire. Note, however, that you generally pay a transaction fee to buy 
funds from firms that don’t offer their own family of funds.
Absent from my list are the large discounters, Fidelity and Schwab. The 
simple reason is that those companies charge significantly higher transaction 
fees than the competition does. These firms can get away with premium 
pricing, despite comparable services, because enough investors prefer to do 
business with name-brand companies. Although I think that both companies 
can offer investors a fine base from which to do their investing, I don’t feel 
that their fees are justified unless you want to do business with a broker that 
maintains a branch office in your area. If you’re going to invest in individual 
stocks (discussed in Chapter 6), Schwab and Fidelity deserve more consider-
ation because they offer a comprehensive array of useful and independent 
research resources.
Considering Online Brokers
For the lowest trading commissions, you generally must place your trades 
online. Even if you’ve never visited an online brokerage site, ads for them 
online, in print publications, and even on national television have surely 
bombarded you. Visit any Web site that’s remotely related to investing in 
stocks, and you’re sure to find ads for various Internet brokers. Anyone 
familiar with the economics of running a brokerage firm can tell you that 
technology, properly applied, reduces a broker’s labor costs. Some 
brokerages — thanks to technology — can now perform market orders 
(which means they’ll execute your trade at the best current available price) 
for a few bucks. Hence the attraction of online trading.
Before you jump at the chance to save a few dollars by trading online, read 
the following sections for other considerations that should factor into your 
choice of an online broker — or your decision to trade online at all.

185
 Chapter 9: Choosing a Brokerage Firm
Examining your online trading motives
If trading online attracts you, first examine why you’re motivated to do so. 
Tracking prices daily (or, even worse, hourly) and frequently checking your 
account balances leads to addictive trading. A low fee of $5 or $10 per trade 
doesn’t really save you any money if you trade a lot and rack up significant 
total commissions, and you pay more in capital gains taxes. Don’t forget 
that as with trading through a regular brokerage firm, you also lose the 
spread (difference between the bid and ask prices when you trade stocks 
and bonds), in addition to the explicit commission rates that online 
brokers charge.
Frankly, trading online is also an unfortunately easy way for people to act 
impulsively and emotionally when making important investment decisions. 
If you’re prone to such actions, or you find yourself tracking and trading 
investments too closely, use the Internet to check account information and 
gather factual information, and stay away from this form of trading.
Know that most of the best investment firms allow you to trade via touch-
tone phone. In most cases, touch-tone phone trading is discounted when 
you compare it to trading through a live broker, although it’s admittedly 
less glamorous than trading through a Web site.
 
Some brokers also offer account information and trading capabilities via 
personal digital assistants, which, of course, add to your costs. Digital 
assistants can also promote addictive investment behaviors.
Investment Web sites also push the surging interest in online trading 
with the pitch that you can beat the market averages and professionals at 
their own game if you do your own research and trade online. Beating 
the market and professionals is highly unlikely. However, you can save 
some money trading online, but probably not as much as the hype has 
you believe.
Considering other costs
 
Online brokerage customers often shop for low costs. However, simply talking 
with enough people who have traded online and reviewing online message 
boards where customers speak their minds clearly show that shopping merely 
for low-cost trading prices often causes the investor to overlook other 
important issues.

186
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
 
 Some discounters don’t provide toll-free phone numbers, so bear this in 
mind if you need to call with questions and service problems. Others 
charge fees for real-time stock quotes (as opposed to quotes that may 
be 15 to 20 minutes old and are free). Some brokers whack you $20 here 
and $50 there for services such as wiring money or simply closing your 
account. Also beware of “inactivity fees” that some brokers levy on 
accounts that have infrequent trading. So before you sign up with any 
broker, make sure that you examine its entire fee schedule.
 
 When you buy or sell an investment, you may have cash sitting around 
in your brokerage account. Not surprisingly, the online brokers pitching 
their cheap online trading rates in 3-inch-high numbers don’t reveal 
their money market rates in such large type (if at all). Some don’t pay 
interest on the first $1,000 or so of your cash balance, and even then, 
some companies pay half a percent to a full percent less than their best 
competitors. In the worst cases, some online brokers have paid up to 
3 percent less. Under those terms, you’d earn up to $150 less in interest 
per year if you averaged a $5,000 cash balance during the year.
Examining service quality
Common complaints among customers of online brokers include slow 
responses to e-mail queries, long dead time as you wait to speak with a live 
person to answer questions or resolve problems, delays in opening accounts 
and receiving literature, unclear statements, incorrect processing of trading 
requests, and slow Web response during periods of heavy traffic. With a 
number of firms that I called, I experienced phone waits of up to ten minutes 
and was transferred several times to retrieve answers to simple questions, 
such as whether the firm carried a specific family of mutual funds.
 
When you shop for an online broker, check your prospects thoroughly. Call 
for literature and see how long reaching a live human being takes. Ask some 
questions and see how knowledgeable and helpful the representatives are. For 
non-retirement accounts, if the quality of the firm’s year-end account state-
ments concern you, ask prospective brokerages to send you a sample. Try 
sending some questions to the broker’s Web site and see how accurate and 
timely the response is. If you’re a mutual fund investor, check out the quality 
of the funds that the company offers — don’t allow the sheer number of funds 
that the company offers impress you. Also, inquire about the interest rates 
that the company pays on cash balances, as well as the rates that the 
company charges on margin loans, if you want such borrowing services.
 
Consider checking online message boards to see what current and past 
customers of the firm say about the firms that you’re considering. Most online 
brokers that have been around for more than six months lay claim to a 
number-one rating with some survey or ranking of online brokers. Place little 
value on such claims.

187
 Chapter 9: Choosing a Brokerage Firm
Also, examine what the firm did before it got into the online brokerage 
business. Would you rather put your money and trust in the hands of an 
established and respected financial service company that has been around 
for a number of years or an upstart firm run by a couple of people hoping 
to strike it rich on the Internet? Transact business only with firms that offer 
Why you should keep your securities 
in a brokerage account
When most investors purchase stocks or bonds 
today, they don’t receive the actual paper cer-
tificate demonstrating ownership. Brokerage 
accounts often hold the certificate for your 
stocks and bonds on your behalf. Holding your 
securities through a brokerage account is ben-
eficial because most brokers charge an extra 
fee to issue certificates.
Sometimes people hold stock and bond certifi-
cates themselves — this practice was more 
common among your parents’ and grandpar-
ents’ generations. The reason: During the Great 
Depression, many brokerage firms failed and 
took people’s assets down with their sinking 
ships. Since then, various reforms have greatly 
strengthened the safety of money and the secu-
rities that you hold in a brokerage account.
Just as the FDIC insurance system backs up 
money in bank accounts, the Securities Investor 
Protection Corporation (SIPC) provides insur-
ance to investment brokerage firm customers. 
The base level of insurance is $500,000 per 
account. However, many firms purchase 
additional protection — some as high as $100 
million total!
Brokerage firms don’t often fail these days, but 
unlike during the Depression, the SIPC protects 
you if they do. However, the SIPC coverage 
doesn’t protect you against a falling stock 
market. If you invest your money in stocks, 
bonds, or whatever that plunge in value, that’s 
your own problem!
Besides not having to worry about losing your 
securities if a brokerage firm fails, another good 
reason to hold securities with a broker is so you 
don’t lose them — literally! Surprising numbers 
of people — the exact number is unknown — 
have lost their stock and bond certificates. 
Those who realize their loss can contact the 
issuing firms to replace them, but doing so takes 
a good deal of time. However, just like future 
goals and plans, some certificates are simply 
lost, and owners never realize their loss. This 
financial fiasco sometimes happens when 
people die and their heirs don’t know where to 
look for the certificates or the securities that 
their loved ones held.
Another reason to hold your securities in a bro-
kerage account is that doing so cuts down on 
processing all those dividend checks. For 
example, if you own a dozen stocks that each 
pay you a quarterly dividend, you must receive, 
endorse, and otherwise deal with 48 separate 
checks. Some people enjoy this practice — 
they say that doing so is part of the “fun” of 
owning securities. My advice: Stick all your 
securities in one brokerage account that holds 
your paid dividends. Brokerage accounts offer 
you the ability to move these payments into a 
reasonably good-yielding money market fund. 
Most of the better discount brokers even allow 
you to reinvest stock dividends in the purchase 
of more shares of that stock at no charge.

188
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
sufficient account insurance (enough to protect your assets) through the 
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). The severe stock market 
downturn in the early 2000s led to the first of what is likely to be many major 
shakeouts, and you need to protect yourself.

Get ting Rich with 
Real Estate

In this part . . .
O
wning a home and investing in real estate are time-
proven methods for building wealth. However, if 
you’re not careful, you can easily fall prey to a number of 
pitfalls. In this part, you discover the right and wrong ways 
to purchase real estate and how to build your real estate 
empire. Even if you don’t want to be a real estate tycoon, 
you also see how simply owning your own home can help 
build your net worth and accomplish future financial goals.

Chapter 10
Investing in a Home
In This Chapter
 Deciding whether to rent or buy
 Finding the best properties to purchase
 Understanding how to figure market value
F
or most people, buying a home in which to live is their first, best, and 
only real estate investment. Homes may require a lot of financial feeding, 
but over the course of your life, owning a home (instead of renting) can make 
and save you money. Although the pile of mortgage debt seems daunting in 
the years just after your purchase, someday your home may be among your 
biggest assets. (And, yes, real estate is still a good investment despite its 
recent declines in the late 2000s in many areas. Like stocks, real estate does 
well over the long term but doesn’t go continuously higher. Smart investors 
take advantage of down periods as times to buy at lower prices just like they 
do when their favorite retail stores are having a sale.)
 
Even though your home consumes a lot of dough (mortgage payments, 
property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and so on) while you own it, it can 
help you accomplish important financial goals, such as:
 
 Retiring: By the time you hit your 50s and 60s, the size of your monthly 
mortgage payment, relative to your income and assets, should start to 
look small or nonexistent. Relatively low housing costs can help you 
afford to retire or cut back from full-time work. Some people are choos-
ing to sell their homes and buy less-costly ones or to rent the homes 
out and use some or all of the cash to live on in retirement. Other home-
owners enhance their retirement income by taking out a reverse mort-
gage to tap the equity (market value of the home minus the outstanding 
mortgage debt) that they’ve built up in their properties.
 
 Pursuing your small-business dreams: Running your own business 
can be a source of great satisfaction. Financial barriers, however, pre-
vent many people from pulling the plug on a regular job and taking the 
entrepreneurial plunge. You may be able to borrow against the equity 
that you’ve built up in your home to get the cash you need to start your 
own business. Depending on what type of business you have in mind, 
you may even be able to run your enterprise from your home. (I discuss 
small-business issues in more detail in Part IV.)

192
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
 Financing college: Although it may seem like only yesterday that your 
kids were born, soon enough they’re ready for an expensive four-year 
undertaking: college. Borrowing against the equity in your home is a 
viable way to help pay for your kids’ educational costs.
Perhaps you won’t use your home’s equity for retirement, a small business, 
educational expenses, or other important financial goals. But even if you 
decide to pass your home on to your children, charity, or a long-lost relative, 
it’s still a valuable asset and a worthwhile investment. This chapter explains 
how to make the most of it.
The Buying Decision
I believe that most people should buy and own a home. But homeownership 
isn’t for everybody and certainly not at all times in your adult life.
The decision about if and when to buy a home can be complex. Money mat-
ters, but so do personal and emotional issues. Buying a home is a big deal — 
you’re settling down. Can you really see yourself coming home to this same 
place day after day, year after year? Of course, you can always move, but now 
you’ve got a financial obligation to deal with.
Weighing the pros and cons of ownership
To hear some people — particularly enthusiastic salespeople in the real 
estate business — everybody should own a home. You may hear them say 
things like the following:
 
 Buy a home for the tax breaks.
 
 Renting is like throwing your money away.
 
As I discuss later in this chapter, the bulk of homeownership costs — namely, 
mortgage interest and property taxes — are tax-deductible. However, these 
tax breaks are already largely factored into the higher cost of owning a home. 
(If such tax breaks didn’t exist, housing prices would be lower because the 
effective cost of owning would be so much higher.) So don’t buy a home just 
because of the tax breaks.
Renting isn’t necessarily “throwing your money away.” In fact, renting can 
have a number of benefits:

193
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
 
 In some communities, with a given type of property, renting is less 
costly than buying. Happy and successful renters who I’ve seen include 
people who pay low rent, perhaps because they’ve made housing sacri-
fices. If you can sock away 10 percent or more of your earnings while 
renting, you’re probably well on your way to accomplishing your future 
financial goals.
 
 You can save money and hopefully invest in other financial assets. 
Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds (see Part II) are quite accessible and 
useful in retirement. Most homeowners, by contrast, have a substantial 
portion of their wealth tied up in their homes. (Accessibility is a double-
edged sword because it may tempt you as a cash-rich renter to blow 
the money in the short term.)
 
 Renting has potential emotional and psychological rewards. First is 
the not-so-inconsequential fact that you have more flexibility to pack 
up and move on. You may have a lease to fulfill, but you can renegotiate 
it if you need to move on. As a homeowner, you have a major monthly 
payment to take care of — to some people, this responsibility feels like 
a financial ball and chain. After all, you have no guarantee that you can 
sell your home in a timely fashion or at the price you desire if you want 
to move.
 
Although renting has its benefits, renting has at least one big drawback: 
exposure to inflation. As the cost of living increases, your landlord can keep 
increasing your rent (unless you live in a rent-controlled unit). If you’re a 
homeowner, however, the big monthly expense of the mortgage payment 
doesn’t increase, assuming that you buy your home with a fixed-rate mort-
gage. (Your property taxes, homeowners insurance, and maintenance 
expenses are exposed to inflation, but these expenses are usually much 
smaller in comparison to your monthly mortgage payment or rent.)
Here’s a quick example to show you how inflation can work against you as a 
long-term renter. Suppose that you’re comparing the costs of owning a home 
that costs $160,000 to renting a similar property for $800 a month. (If you’re 
in a high-cost urban area and these numbers seem low, please bear with me 
and focus on the numbers and accompanying insights, which you can apply 
to higher-cost areas.) Buying at $160,000 sounds a lot more expensive than 
renting, doesn’t it? But this isn’t a fair apples-to-apples comparison. You must 
compare the monthly cost of owning to the monthly cost of renting. You 
must also factor in the tax benefits of homeownership (mortgage interest and 
property taxes are tax-deductible) to your comparison so that you compare 
the after-tax monthly cost of owning versus renting. Figure 10-1 does just that 
over 30 years.

The Cost of Owning versus Renting*
As you can see in Figure 10-1, although it costs more in the early years to 
own, owning should be less expensive in the long run. Renting is higher in the 
long term because all of your rental expenses increase with inflation. Note: I 
haven’t factored in the potential change in the value of your home over time. 
Over long periods of time, home prices tend to appreciate, which makes 
owning even more attractive.
 
The example in Figure 10-1 assumes that you make a 20 percent down pay-
ment and take out a 7 percent fixed-rate mortgage to purchase the property. 
I also assumed that the rate of inflation of your homeowners insurance, 
property taxes, maintenance, and rent is 4 percent per year. If inflation is 
lower, renting doesn’t necessarily become cheaper in the long term. In the 
absence of inflation, your rent should escalate less, but your homeownership 
expenses, which are subject to inflation (property taxes, maintenance, and 
insurance), should increase less, too. And with low inflation, you can probably 
refinance your mortgage at a lower interest rate, which reduces your monthly 
mortgage payments. With low or no inflation, owning can still cost less, 
but the savings versus renting usually aren’t as dramatic as when inflation 
is greater.
Recouping transaction costs
 
Financially speaking, I advise that you wait to buy a home until you can see 
yourself staying put for a minimum of three years. Ideally, I’d like you to think 
that you have a solid chance of staying with the home for five or more years. 
Why? Buying and selling a home cost big bucks, and you generally need at 
least five years to recoup your transaction costs. Some of the expenses you’ll 
face include:

195
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
 
 Inspection fees: You shouldn’t buy a property without thoroughly 
checking it out, so you’ll incur inspection expenses. Good inspectors 
can help you identify problems with the plumbing, heating, and electri-
cal systems. They also check out the foundation, roof, and so on and let 
you know whether termites are living in the house.
 
 Loan costs: The costs of getting a mortgage include such items as the 
points (upfront interest that can run 1 to 2 percent of the loan amount), 
application and credit report fees, and appraisal fees.
 
 Title insurance: When you buy a home, you and your lender need to 
protect yourselves against the chance — albeit small — that the prop-
erty seller doesn’t actually legally own the home that you’re buying. 
That’s where title insurance comes in — it protects you financially from 
unscrupulous sellers.
 
 Moving costs: You can transport all your furniture, clothing, and other 
personal belongings yourself, but your time is worth something, and 
your moving skills are likely limited. Besides, do you want to end up in a 
hospital emergency room after you’re pinned at the bottom of a stair-
case by a runaway couch?
 
 Real estate agents’ commissions: A commission of 5 to 7 percent of the 
purchase price of most homes is paid to the real estate salespeople and 
the companies they work for.
 
On top of all these transaction costs of buying and then selling a home, you’ll 
also face maintenance expenses — for example, fixing leaky pipes and paint-
ing. To cover all the transaction and maintenance costs of homeownership, 
the value of your home needs to appreciate about 15 percent over the years 
that you own it just for you to be as well off financially as if you had continued 
renting. Fifteen percent! If you need or want to move elsewhere in a few years, 
counting on that kind of appreciation in those few years is risky. If you happen 
to buy just before a sharp rise in housing prices, you may get this much appre-
ciation in a short time. But you can’t count on this upswing — you’re more 
likely to lose money on such a short-term deal.
Some people invest in real estate even when they don’t expect to live in the 
home for long and may consider turning their home into a rental if they move 
within a few years. Doing so can work well financially in the long haul, but 
don’t underestimate the responsibilities that come with rental property, 
which I discuss in Chapter 11.
Deciding How Much to Spend
Buying a home is a long-term financial commitment. You’ll probably take out 
a 15- to 30-year mortgage to finance your purchase, and the home that you 
buy will need maintenance over the years. So before you decide to buy, take 
stock of your overall financial health.

196
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
If you have good credit and a reliable source of employment, lenders will 
eagerly offer to loan you money. They’ll tell you how much you may borrow 
from them — the maximum that you’re qualified to borrow. But that doesn’t 
mean that you should borrow the maximum.
If you buy a home without considering your other monthly expenditures and 
long-term goals, you may end up with a home that dictates much of your 
future spending. Have you considered, for example, how much you need to 
save monthly to reach your retirement goals? How about the amount that 
you want to spend on recreation and entertainment?
If you want to continue your current lifestyle, you have to be honest with 
yourself about how much you can really afford to spend as a homeowner. 
First-time homebuyers in particular run into financial trouble when they 
don’t understand their current spending. Buying a home can be a wise deci-
sion, but it can also be a huge burden. And there are all sorts of nifty things 
to buy for a home. Some people prop up their spending habits with credit 
cards — a dangerous practice.
Knowing when to buy
If you’re considering buying a home, you may be 
concerned whether home prices are poised to 
rise or fall. No one wants to purchase a home 
that then plummets in value. And who wouldn’t 
like to buy just before prices go on an upward 
trajectory?
It’s not easy to predict what’s going to happen 
with real estate prices in a particular city, state, 
or country over the next one, two, or three or 
more years. Ultimately, the economic health 
and vitality of an area drive the demand and 
prices for homes in that area. An increase in 
jobs, particularly ones that pay well, increases 
the demand for housing. And when demand 
goes up, so do prices.
If you first buy a home when you’re in your 
20s, 30s, or even your 40s, you may end up as a 
homeowner for several decades. Over such a 
long time, you may experience lots of ups and 
downs, but probably more ups than downs, so I 
wouldn’t be too concerned about trying to pre-
dict what’s going to happen to the real estate 
market in the near term. I know some long-term 
renters who avoided buying homes decades 
ago because they thought that prices were 
expensive. Consequently, they missed out on 
tremendous appreciation in real estate values.
That said, you may be, at particular times in your 
life, ambivalent about buying a home. Perhaps 
you’re not sure that you’ll stay put for more than 
three to five years. Therefore, part of your home-
buying decision may hinge on whether current 
home prices in your local area offer you a good 
value. The level of real estate prices as com-
pared to rent, the state of the job market, and 
the number of home listings for sale are useful 
indicators of the housing market’s health. Trying 
to time your purchase has more importance if 
you think that you may move in less than five 
years. In that case, avoid buying in a high 
market. If you expect to move so soon, renting 
generally makes more sense because of the 
high costs of buying and selling real estate.

197
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
 
Don’t let your home control your financial future. Before you buy a property 
or agree to a particular mortgage, be sure that you can afford to do so — be 
especially careful not to ignore your retirement planning (if you hope to some-
day retire). Start by reading Chapter 3. After reading the following sections, 
you can also check out Chapter 12, where I cover mortgages and financing 
options in greater detail.
Looking through lenders’ eyes
All mortgage lenders want to gauge your ability to repay the money that you 
borrow, so you have to pass a few tests. Mortgage lenders calculate the maxi-
mum amount that you can borrow to buy a piece of real estate.
For a home in which you will reside, lenders total your monthly housing 
expenses. They define your housing costs as:
Mortgage payment + property taxes + insurance
 
A lender doesn’t consider maintenance and upkeep expenses in owning a 
home. Although lenders may not care where you spend money outside your 
home, they do care about your other debt. A lot of other debt, such as credit 
cards or auto loans, diminishes the funds that are available to pay your hous-
ing expenses. Lenders know that having other debt increases the possibility 
that you may fall behind or actually default on your mortgage payments.
If you have consumer debt that requires monthly payments, lenders calculate 
another ratio to determine the maximum that you can borrow. Lenders add 
the amount that you need to pay down your other consumer debt to your 
monthly housing expense.
 
Consumer debt is bad news even without considering that it hurts your quali-
fication for a mortgage. Consumer debt is costly and encourages you to live 
beyond your means. Unlike the interest on mortgage debt, consumer debt 
interest isn’t tax-deductible. Get rid of it — curtail your spending and adjust to 
living within your means. If you can’t live within your means as a renter, doing 
so is going to be even harder as a homeowner.
Determining your down payment
Another factor to consider when you decide how much you should borrow 
is that most lenders require you to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI) 
if your down payment is less than 20 percent of your home’s purchase price. 
PMI protects the lender from getting stuck with a property that may be worth 
less than the mortgage you owe, in the event that you default on your loan. 
On a moderate-size loan, PMI can add hundreds of dollars per year to your 
payments.

198
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
If you have to take PMI to buy a home with less than 20 percent down, keep 
an eye on your home’s value and your loan balance. Over time, your property 
should appreciate, and your loan balance should decrease as you make 
monthly payments. After your mortgage represents 80 percent or less of the 
market value of the home, you can get rid of the PMI (doing so entails con-
tacting your lender and usually requires you to pay for an appraisal).
 
As I said in the prior edition of this book, I have never been a fan of interest-
only loans, which entice cash-strapped buyers with lower monthly payments, 
because all of the initial payments go toward interest. These loans typically 
have worse terms (interest rate and fees) than conventional mortgages and 
cause some buyers to take on more debt than they can handle. After a number 
of years, the payment amount jumps higher when the principal and interest 
begin to be repaid together.
What if you have so much money that you can afford to make more than a 
20 percent down payment? How much should you put down then? (This 
problem doesn’t usually arise — most buyers, especially first-time buyers, 
struggle to get a 20 percent down payment together.) The answer depends 
on what else you can or want to do with the money. If you’re considering 
other investment opportunities, determine whether you can expect to earn 
a higher rate of return on those other investments versus the interest rate 
Homeownership tax savings
Your mortgage interest and property taxes are 
tax-deductible on Form 1040, Schedule A of 
your personal tax return. When you calculate 
the costs of owning a home, subtract the tax 
savings to get a more complete and accurate 
sense of what homeownership will cost you.
When you finally buy a home, be sure to refig-
ure how much you need to pay in income tax, 
because your mortgage interest and property 
tax deductions can help lower your tax bill. If 
you work for an employer, ask your payroll/
benefits department for Form W-4. If you’re 
self-employed, you can complete a worksheet 
that comes with Form 1040-ES. (Call 800-TAX-
FORM [800-829-3676] for a copy.) Many new 
homebuyers don’t bother with this step, and 
they receive a big tax refund on their next filed 
income tax return. Although getting money back 
from the IRS may feel good, it means that at a 
minimum, you gave the IRS an interest-free 
loan. In the worst-case scenario, the reduced 
cash flow during the year may cause you to 
accumulate debt or miss out on contributing to 
tax-deductible retirement accounts.
If you want a more precise estimate as to how 
homeownership may affect your tax situation, 
get out your tax return and plug in some reason-
able numbers to “guesstimate” how your taxes 
may change. You can also speak with a tax 
advisor.
Last but not least, eligible homeowners can 
exclude from taxable income a significant 
portion of their gain on the sale of a principal 
residence: up to $250,000 for single taxpayers 
and $500,000 for married couples filing jointly.

199
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
that you’ll pay on the mortgage. Forget about the tax deduction for your 
mortgage interest. Yes, the interest is deductible, but don’t forget that the 
earnings from your investments are ultimately taxable.
During the past century, stock market and real estate investors have enjoyed 
average annual returns of around 9 to 10 percent per year. So if you borrow 
mortgage money at around 7 to 8 percent, in the long term you should come 
out a couple of percent ahead if you use the money you would have put 
toward a larger down payment to invest in such growth investments. You 
aren’t guaranteed, of course, that your investments will earn 9 to 10 percent 
yearly. (Remember that past returns don’t guarantee the future.) And don’t 
forget that all investments come with risk. The advantage of putting more 
money down for a home and borrowing less is that it’s essentially a risk-free 
investment (as long as you have adequate insurance on your property).
 
If you prefer to put down just 20 percent and invest more money elsewhere, 
that’s fine. Just don’t keep the extra money (beyond an emergency reserve) 
under the mattress, in a savings account, or in bonds that pay less interest 
than your mortgage costs you in interest. Invest in stocks, real estate, or a 
small business. Otherwise, you don’t have a chance at earning a higher return 
than the cost of your mortgage, and you’re therefore better off paying down 
your mortgage.
Selecting Your Property Type
If you’re ready to buy a home, you must make some decisions about what 
and where to buy. If you grew up in the suburbs, your image of a home may 
include the traditional single-family home with a lawn, a couple of kids, and 
the family pets. But single-family homes, of course, aren’t the only or even 
the main types of residential housing in many areas, especially in some 
higher-cost, urban neighborhoods. Other common types of higher-density 
housing include the following:
 
 Condominiums: These are generally apartment-style units that are 
stacked on top of and adjacent to one another. Many condo buildings 
were originally apartments that were converted — through the sale 
of ownership of separate units — into condos. When you purchase a 
condominium, you purchase a specific unit as well as a share of the 
common areas (for example, the pool, grass and other plantings, entry 
and hallways, laundry room, and so on).
 
 Townhomes: Townhome is just a fancy way of saying attached or row 
home. Think of a townhome as a cross between a condominium and a 
single-family house. Townhomes are condolike because they’re attached 
(generally sharing walls and a roof) and are homelike because they’re 
often two-story buildings that come with a small yard.

200
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
 Cooperatives: Cooperatives (usually called co-ops) resemble apartment 
and condominium buildings. When you buy a share in a cooperative, 
you own a share of the entire building, including some living space. 
Unlike in a condo, you generally need to get approval from the coopera-
tive association if you want to remodel or rent your unit to a tenant. In 
some co-ops, you must even gain approval from the association for the 
sale of your unit to a proposed buyer. Co-ops are generally much harder 
to obtain loans for and to sell, so I don’t recommend that you buy one 
unless you get a good deal and can easily obtain a loan.
All types of shared housing (the types of housing in the preceding list) offer 
two potential advantages:
 
 First, this type of housing generally gives you more living space for your 
dollars. This value makes sense because with a single-family home, a 
good chunk of the property’s cost is for the land that the home sits on. 
Land is good for decks, recreation, and playing children, but you don’t 
live “in” it the way you do with your home. Shared housing maximizes 
living space for the housing dollars that you spend.
 
 Another benefit of shared housing is that in many situations, you’re not 
personally responsible for general maintenance. Instead, the homeown-
ers association (which you pay into) takes care of it. If you don’t have 
the time, energy, or desire to keep up a property, shared housing can 
make sense. Shared housing units may also give you access to recre-
ation facilities, such as a pool, tennis courts, and exercise equipment.
So why doesn’t everyone purchase shared housing? Well, as investments, 
single-family homes generally perform better in the long run. In a good real 
estate market, single-family homes tend to outperform other housing types. 
Shared housing is easier to build (and to overbuild) — and the greater supply 
tends to keep its prices from rising as much. Single-family homes tend to 
attract more potential buyers — most people, when they can afford it, prefer 
a stand-alone home, especially for the increased privacy.
 
If you can afford a smaller single-family home instead of a larger shared-
housing unit, buy the single-family home. Shared housing makes more sense 
for people who don’t want to deal with building maintenance and who value 
the security of living in a larger building with other people. Also know that 
shared-housing prices tend to hold up better in developed urban environ-
ments. If possible, avoid shared housing units in suburban areas where the 
availability of developable land makes building many more units possible, 
thus increasing the supply of housing and slowing growth in values.
If shared housing interests you, make sure that you have the property 
thoroughly inspected. Also, examine the trend in maintenance fees over 
time to ensure that these costs are under control. (See Chapter 11 for 
more specifics on how to check out property.)

 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
Finding the Right Property and Location
Some people know where they want to live, so they look at just a handful of 
properties and then buy. Most people take much more time — finding the 
right house in a desired area at a fair price can take a lot of time. Buying a 
home can also entail much compromise when you buy with other family 
members (particularly spouses).
Be realistic about how long it may take you to get up to speed about different 
areas and to find a home that meets your various desires and concerns. If 
you’re a normal person with a full-time job and you’re confined to occasional 
weekends and evenings to look for a house, three to six months is a short 
time period to settle on an area and actually find and successfully negotiate 
on a property. Six months to a year isn’t unusual or slow. Remember that 
you’re talking about an enormous purchase that you’ll come home to daily.
 
Real estate agents can be a big barrier to taking your time with this monumen-
tal decision. Some agents are pushy and want to make a sale and get their 
commission. Don’t work with such agents as a buyer — they can make you 
miserable, unhappy, and broke. If necessary, begin your search without an 
agent to avoid this outside pressure. See Chapter 12 for additional information 
on working with an agent.
Keeping an open mind
Before you start your search, you may have an idea about the type of prop-
erty and location that interests you or that you think you can afford. You may 
think, for example, that you can afford only a condominium in the neighbor-
hood that you want. But if you take the time to check out other communities, 
you may find another area that meets most of your needs and has affordable 
single-family homes. You’d never know that, though, if you narrowed your 
search too quickly.
Even if you’ve lived in an area for a while and think that you know it well, look 
at different types of properties in a variety of locations before you start to 
narrow your search. Be open-minded and make sure that you know which of 
your many criteria for a home you really care about. You’ll likely have to be 
flexible with some of your preferences.
 
After you focus on a particular area or neighborhood, make sure that you see 
the full range of properties available. If you want to spend $200,000 on a home, 
look at properties that are more expensive. Most real estate sells for less than 
its listing price, and you may feel comfortable spending a little bit more after 
you see what you can purchase if you stretch your budget a little bit. Also, if 
you work with an agent, make sure that you don’t overlook homes that are for 
sale by their owners (that is, properties not listed with real estate agents). 
Otherwise, you may miss out on some good prospects.

202
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Research, research, research
 
Thinking that you can know what an area is like from anecdotes or from a 
small number of personal experiences is a mistake. You may have read or 
heard that someone was mugged in a particular area. That doesn’t make that 
area dangerous — or more dangerous than others. Get the facts. Anecdotes 
and people’s perceptions often aren’t accurate reflections of the facts. Check 
out the following key items:
 
 Amenities: Hopefully, you don’t spend all your time at work, slaving 
away to make your monthly mortgage payment. I hope that you have 
time to use parks, sports and recreation facilities, and so on. You can 
drive around the neighborhood you’re interested in to get a sense of 
these attractions. Most real estate agents just love to show off their 
favorite neighborhoods. Cities and towns can also mail you information 
booklets that detail what they have to offer and where you can find it.
 
 Schools: If you have kids, you care about this issue a lot. Unfortunately, 
many people make snap judgments about school quality without doing 
their homework. Visit the schools and don’t blindly rely on test scores. 
Talk to parents and teachers and discover what goes on at the schools.
 
 If you don’t have (or want!) school-age children, you may be tempted 
to say, “What the heck do I care about the quality of the schools?” You 
need to care about the schools because even if you don’t have kids, the 
quality of the local schools and whether they’re improving or faltering 
has direct bearing on the value of your property. Consider these issues 
even if they’re not important to you, because they can affect the resale 
value of your property.
 
 Property taxes: What will your property taxes be? Property tax rates 
vary from community to community. Check with the town’s assessment 
office or with a good real estate agent.
 
 Crime: Call the local police department or visit your public library to 
get the facts on crime. Cities and towns keep all sorts of crime statistics 
for neighborhoods — use them!
 
 Future development: Check with the planning department in towns that 
you’re considering living in to find out what types of new development 
and major renovations are in the works. Planning people may also be 
aware of problems in particular areas.
 
 Catastrophic risks: Are the neighborhoods that you’re considering 
buying a home in susceptible to major risks, such as floods, tornadoes, 
mudslides, fires, or earthquakes? Although homeowners insurance can 
protect you financially, consider how you may deal with such catastro-
phes emotionally — insurance eases only the financial pain of a home 
loss. All areas have some risk, and a home in the safest of areas can burn 
to the ground. Although you can’t eliminate all risks, you can at least 
educate yourself about the potential catastrophic risks in various areas.

203
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
 
 If you’re new to an area or don’t have a handle on an area’s risks, try 
a number of different sources. Knowledgeable and honest real estate 
agents may help, but you can also dig for primary information. For exam-
ple, the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) puts together maps that help you 
see potential earthquake risks by area. The USGS maintains offices all 
around the country — check your local phone directory in the govern-
ment White Pages section (or visit the agency online at www.usgs.gov). 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides maps 
that show flood risk areas. (Call FEMA at 800-358-9616 or check its Web 
site at www.fema.gov.) Insurance companies and agencies can also tell 
you what they know about risks in particular areas.
Understanding market value
Over many months, you’ll perhaps look at dozens of properties for sale. 
Use these viewings as an opportunity to find out what places are worth. The 
listing price isn’t what a house is worth — it may be, but odds are it’s not. 
Property that is priced to sell usually does just that — it sells. Properties left 
on the market are often overpriced. The listing price on such properties may 
reflect what an otherwise greedy or uninformed seller and his agent hope 
that some fool will pay.
 
Of the properties that you see, keep track of the prices that they end up 
selling for. (Good agents can help you obtain this information.) Properties 
usually sell for less than the listed price. Keeping track of selling prices gives 
you a good handle on what properties are really worth and a better sense of 
what you can afford.
Pounding the pavement
After you set your sights on that special home, thoroughly check out the 
surroundings — you should know what you’re getting yourself into.
 
Go back to the neighborhood in which the property is located at different 
times of the day and on different days of the week. Knock on a few doors and 
meet your potential neighbors. Ask questions. Talk to property owners as well 
as renters. Because they don’t have a financial stake in the area, renters are 
often more forthcoming with negative information about an area.
After you decide where and what to buy, you’re ready to try to put a deal 
together. I cover issues common to both home and investment property 
purchases — such as mortgages, negotiations, inspections, and so on — in 
Chapter 12.

I
f you’ve already bought your own home (and even if you haven’t), using 
real estate as an investment may interest you. Over the decades and gen-
erations, real estate investing, like the stock market and small-business 
investments, has generated tremendous wealth for participants. (Please see 
Chapter 2 for more on the rate of return from good real estate investments.)
 
Real estate is like other types of ownership investments, such as stocks, 
where you have an ownership stake in an asset. Although you have the poten-
tial for significant profits, don’t forget that you also accept greater risk. Real 
estate isn’t a gravy train or a simple way to get wealthy. Like stocks, real 
estate goes through good and bad performance periods. Most people who 
make money investing in real estate do so because they invest and hold prop-
erty over many years. The vast majority of people who don’t make money in 
real estate don’t because they make easily avoidable mistakes. In this chapter, 
I discuss how to make the best real estate investments and avoid the rest.
Outlining Real Estate Investment 
Attractions
As I discuss in Chapter 1, many types of people build their wealth by invest-
ing in real estate. Some people focus exclusively on property investments, 
but many others build their wealth through the companies that they started 
or through other avenues and then diversify into real estate investments. 
What do these wealthy folks know, and why do they choose to invest in real 
estate? In the following sections, I cover some of real estate’s attractions.

206
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
Real estate, like all investments, has its pros and cons. Investing in real estate 
is time intensive and carries investment and other risks. Invest in real estate 
because you enjoy the challenge and because you want to diversify your 
portfolio (an advantage of real estate is that its value doesn’t move in lockstep 
with other investments, such as stocks or small-business investments that you 
hold). Don’t take this route because you seek a get-rich-quick outlet.
Limited land
The supply of buildable, desirable land on planet Earth is limited. And 
because people are prone to reproduce, demand for land and housing 
continues to grow. Land and what you can do with it are what make real 
estate valuable. Cities and islands such as Hawaii, Hong Kong, San Francisco, 
Los Angeles, and New York City have the highest housing costs around 
because land is limited in these places.
Leverage
Real estate is different from most other investments in that you can borrow 
80 to 90 percent (or more) of the value of the property to buy it. Thus, you 
can use your small down payment of 10 to 20 percent of the purchase price 
to buy, own, and control a much larger investment; this concept is called 
leverage. Of course, you hope that the value of your real estate goes up — if it 
does, you make money on your original dollars invested, as well as on the 
money that you borrowed.
Here’s a quick example to illustrate. Suppose that you purchase a rental 
property for $150,000 and make a $30,000 down payment. Over the next three 
years, imagine that the property appreciates to $180,000. Thus, you have a 
profit (on paper at least) of $30,000 on an investment of just $30,000. In other 
words, you’ve made a 100 percent return on your investment. (Note that in 
this scenario, I ignore whether your expenses from the property exceed the 
rental income that you collect.)
 
Leverage is good for you if property prices appreciate, but leverage can also 
work against you. If your $150,000 property decreases in value to $120,000, 
even though it’s dropped only 20 percent in value, you actually lose (on 
paper) 100 percent of your original $30,000 investment. If you have an out-
standing mortgage of $120,000 on this property and you need to sell, you 
actually must pay money into the sale to cover selling costs, in addition to 
losing your entire original investment. Ouch!

207
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
Appreciation and income
Another reason that real estate is a popular investment is that you can make 
money from it in two major ways.
 
 First, you hope and expect that over the years, your real estate invest-
ments will appreciate in value. The appreciation of your properties com-
pounds tax deferred during your years of ownership. You don’t pay tax 
on this profit until you sell your property — and even then you can roll 
over your gain into another investment property and avoid paying tax. 
(See the “Roll over those rental property profits” sidebar, later in this 
chapter, for details on tax-deferred exchanges of investment properties.)
 
 Thanks to tax law changes in the early 2000s, if you choose to simply 
take your profits and not roll them over, the federal tax rate on gains 
from property held more than one year — known as long-term capital 
gains — are taxed at no more than 15 percent. That’s a heck of a deal 
when you consider that ordinary income can be taxed at rates approach-
ing 40 percent. (With the November 2008 elections, it’s possible that the 
long-term capital gains tax rate could increase.)
 
 In addition to making money from your properties’ increase in value, 
you can also make money from the ongoing business that you run — 
renting the property. You rent out investment property to make a profit 
based on the property’s rental income that (hopefully) exceeds your 
expenses (mortgage, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and so 
on). Unless you make a large down payment, your monthly operating 
profit is small or nonexistent in the early years of rental property owner-
ship. Over time, your operating profit, which is subject to ordinary 
income tax, should rise as you increase your rental prices faster than 
your expenses. During soft periods in the local economy, however, rents 
may rise more slowly than your expenses (or rents may even fall).
Ability to “add value”
You as a small investor can’t add value to stocks by “fixing them up,” but 
you may have some good ideas about how to improve a property and make 
it more valuable. Perhaps you can fix up a property or develop it further 
and raise the rental income and resale value accordingly. Through legwork, 
persistence, and good negotiating skills, you can purchase a property below 
its fair market value.
Relative to investing in the stock market, tenacious and savvy real estate 
investors can more easily buy property below its fair market value. You can 
do the same in the stock market, but the scores of professional, full-time 
money managers who analyze stocks make finding bargains more difficult.

208
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Ego gratification
Face it, investing in real estate appeals to some investors because land and 
buildings are tangible. Although few admit it, some real estate investors get 
an ego rush from a tangible display of their wealth. You can drive past invest-
ment real estate and show it off to others. In an article in The New York Times 
titled “What My Ego Wants, My Ego Gets,” Donald Trump publicly admitted 
what most everyone else knew long ago: He holds his real estate investments 
partly for his ego. Trump confessed of his purchase of the famed Plaza 
Hotel in the Big Apple, “I realized it was 100 percent true — ego did play a 
large role in the Plaza purchase and is, in fact, a significant factor in all of 
my deals.”
Longer-term focus
One problem with investing in the securities markets, such as the stock 
market, is that prices are constantly changing. Television news programs, 
Web sites, BlackBerrys, and other communication devices dutifully report 
the latest price quotes. From my observations and my work with individual 
Roll over those rental property profits
When you sell a stock or mutual fund invest-
ment that you hold outside a retirement account, 
you must pay tax on your profits. By contrast, if 
you roll over your gain into another like-kind 
investment real estate property, you can avoid 
paying tax on your rental property profit when 
you sell.
The rules for properly making one of these 
(IRS code section) 1031 exchanges (also 
called Starker exchanges) are complex and 
usually involve third parties. With like-kind 
transactions, you don’t receive the proceeds of 
the sale — they must go into an escrow account 
(explained in Chapter 12). You must complete 
the rollover within a six-month time limit, and 
you must also identify a replacement property 
within 45 days of the sale of the first property. 
Make sure that you find an attorney and/or tax 
advisor who is an expert at these transactions 
to ensure that everything goes smoothly (and 
legally).
If you don’t roll over your gain, you may owe 
significant taxes because of how the IRS 
defines your gain. For example, if you buy a 
property for $200,000 and sell it for $250,000, you 
not only owe tax on that difference, but you also 
owe tax on an additional amount, depending on 
the property’s depreciation. The amount of 
depreciation that you deducted on your tax 
returns reduces the original $200,000 purchase 
price, making the taxable difference that much 
larger. For example, if you deducted $25,000 for 
depreciation over the years that you owned the 
property, you owe tax on the difference between 
the sale price of $250,000 and $175,000 ($200,000 
purchase price minus $25,000 depreciation).

209
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
investors, I’ve seen the constant changes in the financial markets; the con-
stant reports on those changes cause some investors to lose sight of the long 
term and the big picture. In the worst cases, large short-term drops lead 
investors to panic and sell at what end up being bargain prices. Or headlines 
about big increases pull investors in lemminglike fashion into an overheated 
and peaking market. Because all you need to do is click your computer 
mouse or dial a toll-free phone number to place your sell or buy order, some 
stock market investors fall prey to snap, irrational judgments.
Like the stock market, the real estate market is constantly changing. 
However, to a real estate investor, short-term, day-to-day, and week-to-week 
changes are invisible. Publications don’t report the value of your real estate 
holdings daily, weekly, or even monthly, which is good because it encourages 
a longer-term focus. If prices do decline over the months and years, you’re 
much less likely to sell in a panic with real estate. Preparing a property for 
sale and eventually getting it sold take a good deal of time, and this barrier 
to quickly selling helps keep your vision in focus.
Figuring Out Who Should Avoid 
Real Estate Investing
 
Real estate investing isn’t for everyone; not even close. Most people do better 
financially when they invest their ownership holdings in a diversified portfolio 
of stocks, such as through stock mutual funds. Shy away from real estate 
investments that involve managing property if you fall into either of the 
following categories:
 
 You’re time starved and anxious. Buying and owning investment 
property and being a landlord take a lot of time. If you fail to do your 
homework before purchasing real estate, you can end up overpaying — 
or buying a heap of trouble. As for managing a property, you can hire a 
property manager to help with screening and finding good tenants and 
troubleshooting problems with the building, but this step costs money 
and still requires some time involvement. Also, remember that most 
tenants don’t care for a property the same way property owners do. If 
every little scratch or carpet stain sends your blood pressure skyward, 
avoid distressing yourself as a landlord.
 
 You’re not interested in real estate. Some people simply don’t feel 
comfortable and informed when it comes to investing in real estate. If 
you’ve had experience and success with stock market investing, that’s 
a good reason to stick with it and avoid real estate. Over long periods of 
time, both stocks and real estate provide comparable returns.

210
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Examining Simple, Profitable 
Real Estate Investments
Investing in rental real estate that you’re responsible for can be a lot of work. 
With rental properties, you have all the headaches of maintaining a property, 
including finding and dealing with tenants, without the benefits of living in 
and enjoying the property.
Real estate investing isn’t as wonderful as they say
If you’ve attempted to read or have read some 
of the many real estate investment books that 
have been published over the years, you may 
need to slightly deprogram yourself. Too often, 
authors attempt to make real estate invest-
ments sound like the one and only sure way to 
become a multimillionaire with little effort. 
Consider the following statements made by real 
estate book authors. My rebuttals to their claims 
follow:
“Rather than yielding only a small interest pay-
ment or dividend, real estate in prime locations 
can appreciate 20 percent a year or more.”
Bank accounts, bonds, and stocks pay interest 
or dividends that typically amount to 2 to 6 per-
cent per year (the total return on stocks is about 
9 to 10 percent per year). However, bank 
accounts and bonds aren’t comparable invest-
ments to stocks or real estate — they’re far 
more conservative and liquid and therefore 
don’t offer the potential for double-digit returns. 
Stock market investing is comparable to invest-
ing in real estate, but you shouldn’t go into real 
estate investments expecting annual returns of 
20 percent or more. Those who purchased good 
Los Angeles real estate in the 1950s and held 
onto it for the next three decades earned hand-
some returns as the population of this area 
boomed. Finding areas like Los Angeles and 
knowing how long to hold on to investments in 
these areas is easier said than done. With real 
estate investments, you can expect to earn 8 to 
12 percent per year, but not 20 percent or 
more.
“A good piece of property can’t do anything but 
go up!”
Any city, town, or community has good pieces 
of real estate. But that doesn’t mean that com-
munities can’t and won’t have slow or depressed 
years. Real estate in some parts of the Midwest 
and South, for example, has appreciated 
quite slowly — at or just above the rate of infla-
tion — for periods as long as a generation or 
more.
“Real estate is the best way of preserving and 
enhancing wealth. . . . [it] stands head 
and shoulders above any other form of 
investment.”
Investing in stocks or in a small business is 
every bit as profitable as investing in real estate. 
In fact, more great fortunes have been built in 
small business than in any other form of invest-
ment. Over the long term, stock market inves-
tors have enjoyed (with far less hassle) average 
annual rates of return comparable to real estate 
investors’ returns.

 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
 
Unless you’re extraordinarily interested in and motivated to own investment 
real estate, start with and perhaps limit your real estate investing to a couple 
of much simpler yet still profitable methods that I discuss in this section.
A place to call home
During your adult life, you need a roof over your head. However, you may be 
able to sponge off your folks or some other relative for a number of years. If 
you’re content with this arrangement, you can minimize your housing costs 
and save more for a down payment and possibly toward other goals. Go for 
it, if your relatives will!
But what if neither you nor your relatives are up for the challenge? For the 
long term, because you need a place to live, why not own real estate instead 
of renting it? Real estate is the only investment that you can live in or rent 
to produce income. You can’t live in a stock, bond, or mutual fund! Unless 
you expect to move within the next few years, buying a place probably makes 
good long-term financial sense. In the long term, owning usually costs less 
than renting and allows you to build equity in an asset. Read Chapter 10 to 
find out more about profiting from homeownership.
Real estate investment trusts
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are entities that generally invest in differ-
ent types of property, such as shopping centers, apartments, and other 
rental buildings. For a fee, REIT managers identify and negotiate the purchase 
of properties that they believe are good investments and manage these prop-
erties, including all tenant relations. Thus, REITs are a good way to invest in 
real estate for people who don’t want the hassles and headaches that come 
with directly owning and managing rental property.
 
Surprisingly, most books that focus on real estate investing neglect REITs. 
Why? I have come to the conclusion that they do so for three major reasons.
 
 First, if you invest in real estate through REITs, you don’t need to read 
a long, complicated book on real estate investment.
 
 Second, real estate brokers write many of these books. Not surprisingly, 
the real estate investment strategies touted in these books include and 
advocate the use of such brokers. You can buy REITs without real 
estate brokers.
 
 Finally, a certain snobbishness prevails among people who consider 
themselves to be “serious” real estate investors. One real estate writer/
investor went so far as to say that REITs aren’t “real” real estate 
investments.

212
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Please. No, you can’t drive your friends by a REIT and show it off. But those 
who put their egos aside when making real estate investments are happy that 
they considered REITs and have enjoyed double-digit annual gains over the 
decades.
You can research and purchase shares in individual REITs, which trade as 
securities on the major stock exchanges. An even better approach is to buy 
a mutual fund that invests in a diversified mixture of REITs (see Chapter 8).
In addition to providing you with a diversified, low-hassle real estate invest-
ment, REITs offer an additional advantage that traditional rental real estate 
doesn’t: You can easily invest in REITs through a retirement account (for 
example, IRA or Keogh). As with traditional real estate investments, you can 
even buy REITs and mutual fund REITs with borrowed money. You can buy 
with 50 percent down, called buying on margin, when you purchase such 
investments through a non-retirement brokerage account.
Evaluating Direct Property Investments
Every year Forbes magazine publishes a special issue that profiles the 400 
wealthiest Americans, known as the Forbes 400. To get on the list, you must 
Converting your home into a rental
If you move into another home, turning your 
current home into a rental property may make 
sense. After all, it saves you the time and cost 
of finding a separate rental property.
Unfortunately, many people make the mistake 
of holding on to their current home for the 
wrong reasons when they buy another. This 
situation often happens when homeowners 
must sell their home in a depressed market 
(such as existed in many areas in the late 2000s). 
Nobody likes to lose money and sell their home 
for less than they paid for it. Thus, some owners 
hold on to their homes until prices recover.
If you plan to move and want to keep your 
current home as a long-term investment prop-
erty, you can. But turning your home into a 
short-term rental is usually a bad move for a 
couple of reasons.
  First, you may not want the responsibilities 
of a landlord, yet you force yourself into the 
landlord business when you convert your 
home into a rental.
  Second, if the home eventually does 
rebound in value, you owe tax on the profit 
if your property is a rental when you sell it 
and don’t buy another rental property. You 
can purchase another rental property 
through a 1031 exchange to defer paying 
taxes on your profit. (See the “Roll over 
those rental property profits” sidebar, ear-
lier in this chapter.)

make the money through legitimate and legal channels (Forbes leaves out 
mobsters and drug kingpins). Numerous people made the most recent list 
primarily because of their real estate investments. For others on the list, real 
estate was an important secondary factor that contributed to their wealth.
Consider the case of Thomas Flatley. An Irish immigrant, he was practically 
broke when he came to America in 1950 at age 18. After dabbling in his 
own small business, he got into real estate development. Today he owns 
thousands of apartments, more than a dozen hotels, and millions of square 
feet of office and retail space, and his net worth is more than $1 billion. 
That’s a lot of property and tenants to manage!
If you think you’re cut out to be a landlord and are ready for the responsibil-
ity of buying, owning, and managing rental real estate, you have lots of direct 
real estate investment options from which to choose.
 
Before you begin this potentially treacherous journey, I strongly recommend 
that you read Chapter 10. Many concepts that you need to know to be a 
successful real estate investor are similar to those that you need when you 
buy a home. The rest of this chapter focuses on issues that are more unique 
to real estate investing.
Ideally, you should plan to make real estate investments that you hold until, 
and perhaps through, your retirement years, although some investors prefer 
to buy properties, improve them, and then move on. But what should you 
buy? The following is my take on various real estate investments.
Residential housing
 
Your best bet for real estate investing is to purchase residential property. 
People always need a place to live. Residential housing is easier to under-
stand, purchase, and manage than most other types of property, such as 
office and retail property. If you’re a homeowner, you already have experience 
locating, purchasing, and maintaining residential property.
The most common residential housing options are single-family homes, 
condominiums, and townhouses. You can also purchase multiunit buildings. 
In addition to the considerations that I address in Chapter 10, from an invest-
ment and rental perspective, consider the following issues when you decide 
what type of property to buy:
 
 Tenants: Single-family homes with just one tenant (could be a family, 
a couple, or a single person) are simpler to deal with than a multiunit 
apartment building that requires the management and maintenance of 
multiple renters and units.

214
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
 Maintenance: From the property owner’s perspective, condominiums 
are generally the lowest-maintenance properties because most condo-
minium associations deal with issues such as roofing, gardening, and so 
on for the entire building. Note that as the owner, you’re still responsi-
ble for maintenance that is needed inside your unit, such as servicing 
appliances, interior painting, and so on. Beware, though, that some 
condo complexes don’t allow rentals.
 
 With a single-family home or apartment building, you’re responsible for 
all the maintenance. Of course, you can hire someone to do the work, 
but you still have to find the contractors and coordinate and oversee 
the work.
 
 Appreciation potential: Look for property where simple cosmetic and 
other fixes may allow you to increase rents. Such improvements can 
increase the market value of the property. Although condos may be 
easier on the unit owner to maintain, they tend to appreciate less 
than homes or apartment buildings, unless the condos are located in 
a desirable urban area. One way to add value to some larger properties 
is to “condo-ize” them. In some areas, if zoning allows, you can convert a 
single-family home or multiunit apartment building into condominiums. 
Keep in mind, however, that this metamorphosis requires significant 
research, both on the zoning front as well as with estimating remodeling 
and construction costs.
 
 Cash flow: As I discuss in the “Examining and estimating cash flow” 
section later in the chapter, your rental property brings in rental income 
that you hope covers and exceeds your expenses. The difference 
between the rental income that you collect and the expenses that you 
pay out is known as your cash flow.
 
 Unless you can afford a large down payment (25 percent or more), the 
early years of rental property ownership may financially challenge 
you. Making a profit in the early years from the monthly cash flow with 
a single-family home is hard because such properties usually sell at a 
premium price relative to the rent that they can command. Remember, 
you pay extra for the land, which you can’t rent. Also, the downside to 
having just one tenant is that when you have a vacancy, you have no 
rental income.
 
 Apartment buildings, particularly those with more units, can generally 
produce a small positive cash flow, even in the early years of rental own-
ership. With all properties, as time goes on, generating a positive cash 
flow gets easier as you pay down your mortgage debt and hopefully 
increase your rents.
 
Unless you really want to minimize maintenance responsibilities, avoid 
condominium investments. Single-family home investments are generally more 
straightforward for most people. Just make sure that you run the numbers 
(I show you how in the “Examining and estimating cash flow” section, later in 
this chapter) on your rental income and expenses to see whether you can 

215
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
afford the negative cash flow that often occurs in the early years of ownership. 
Apartment building investments are best left to sophisticated investors who 
like a challenge and can manage more complex properties. As I discuss in 
Chapter 12, do thorough inspections before you buy any rental property.
Land
 
If tenants are a hassle and maintaining a building is a never-ending pain, why 
not invest in land? Buy land in an area that will soon experience a building 
boom, hold on to it until prices soar, and then cash in. Such an investment 
idea sounds good in theory. In practice, however, making the big bucks 
through land investments isn’t easy. Although land doesn’t require upkeep 
and tenants, it does require financial feeding.
Investing in land is a cash drain, and because it costs money to purchase 
land, you also have a mortgage payment to make. Mortgage lenders charge 
higher interest rates on loans to purchase land because they see it as a more 
speculative investment. You don’t get depreciation tax write-offs because 
land isn’t depreciable. You also have property tax payments to meet, as 
well as other expenses. However, with land investments, you don’t receive 
income from the property to offset these expenses.
If you decide that you someday want to develop the property, that will 
also cost you a hefty chunk of money. Obtaining a loan for development is 
challenging and more expensive (because it’s riskier for the lender) than 
obtaining a loan for a developed property.
Identifying many years in advance which communities will experience rapid 
population and job growth isn’t easy. Land in those areas that people believe 
will be the next hot spot already sells at a premium price. If property growth 
doesn’t meet expectations, appreciation will be low or nonexistent.
 
If you decide to invest in land, be sure that you:
 
 Can afford it: Tally up the annual carrying costs so that you can see 
what your cash drain may be. What are the financial consequences 
of this cash outflow? For example, will you be able to fund your tax-
advantaged retirement accounts? If you can’t, count the lost tax 
benefits as another cost of owning land.
 
 Understand what further improvements the land needs: Running 
utility lines, building roads, landscaping, and so on all cost money. If 
you plan to develop and build on the land that you purchase, research 
what these things may cost. Make sure that you don’t make these 
estimates with your rose-tinted sunglasses on — improvements almost 
always cost more than you expect.

216
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
 Know its zoning status: The value of land depends heavily on what 
you can develop on it. Never purchase land without thoroughly under-
standing its zoning status and what you can and can’t build on it. 
Also research the disposition of the planning department and nearby 
communities. Areas that are antigrowth and antidevelopment are less 
likely to be good places for you to invest in land, especially if you need 
permission to do the type of project that you have in mind. Beware 
that zoning can change for the worse — sometimes a zoning alteration 
can reduce what you can develop on a property and, consequently, the 
property’s value.
 
 Become familiar with the local economic and housing situations: 
In the best of all worlds, you want to buy land in an area that is home 
to rapidly expanding companies and that has a shortage of housing 
and developable land. I discuss how to research these issues in the 
upcoming section “Deciding Where and What to Buy.”
Commercial real estate
Ever thought about owning and renting out a small office building or strip 
mall? If you’re really motivated and willing to roll up your sleeves, you may 
want to consider commercial real estate investments. Generally, you’re 
better off not investing in such real estate because it’s much more compli-
cated than investing in residential real estate. It’s also riskier from an invest-
ment and tenant-turnover perspective. When tenants move out, new tenants 
sometimes require extensive and costly improvements, which you’ll likely 
need to provide to compete with other building owners.
If you’re a knowledgeable real estate investor and you like a challenge, there 
are two good reasons to invest in commercial real estate:
 
 If your analysis of the local market suggests that it’s a good time to buy
 
 If you can use some of the space to run your own small business
Just as owning your home is generally more cost-effective than renting over 
the years, so it is with commercial real estate if — and this is a big if — you 
buy at a reasonably good time and hold the property for many years.
 
So how do you evaluate the state of your local commercial real estate market? 
Examine the supply-and-demand statistics over recent years. How much space 
is available for rent, and how has that changed over time? What is the vacancy 
rate, and how has that changed in recent years? Also investigate the rental 
rates, usually quoted as a price per square foot. See the section “Deciding 
Where and What to Buy,” later in this chapter, to find out how to gather this 
kind of information.

217
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
 
One way to tell that purchasing a commercial property in an area is a bad 
idea is a market where the supply of available space has increased faster than 
demand, leading to falling rental rates and higher vacancies. A slowing local 
economy and a higher unemployment rate also spell trouble for commercial 
real estate prices. Each market is different, so make sure you check out the 
details of your area. In the next section, I explain where you can find such 
information.
Deciding Where and What to Buy
If you’re going to invest in real estate, you can do tons of research to decide 
where and what to buy. Keep in mind, though, that as in other aspects of 
life, you can spend the rest of your life looking for the perfect real estate 
investment, never find it, never invest, and miss out on lots of opportunities, 
profit, and even fun. In the following sections, I explain what to look for in a 
community and area that you seek to invest in.
 
I’m not suggesting that you need to conduct a nationwide search for the best 
areas. In fact, investing in real estate closer to home is best because you’re 
probably more familiar with the local area and you should have an easier time 
researching and managing local property.
Considering economic issues
 
People need a place to live, but an area doesn’t generally attract homebuyers 
if no jobs exist. Ideally, look to invest in real estate in communities that main-
tain diverse job bases. If the local economy relies heavily on jobs in a small 
number of industries, that dependence increases the risk of your real estate 
investments. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles this data for metro-
politan areas and counties. A good local library should have this data. You 
can also visit the bureau’s Web site at www.bls.gov.
Also, consider which industries are more heavily represented in the local 
economy. If most of the jobs come from slow-growing or shrinking employ-
ment sectors, real estate prices are unlikely to rise quickly in the years 
ahead. On the other hand, areas with a greater preponderance of high-growth 
industries stand a greater chance of faster price appreciation.
Also, check out the unemployment situation and examine how the jobless 
rate has changed in recent years. Good signs to look for are declining 
unemployment and increasing job growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics 
also tracks this data.

Evaluating the real estate market
The price of real estate, like the price of anything else, is driven by supply 
and demand. The smaller the supply and the greater the demand, the higher 
prices climb. Some real estate investors find out this fact the hard way. One 
such investor (John Reed, who also writes about real estate) lost all the 
money he had made in 15 years of apartment investing as a result of owning 
apartments in Texas when the overbuilding occurred in the mid-1980s.
Ouch! Imagine investing for 15 years and then losing it all! Credit was loose 
in some areas during the 1980s, which led to a building boom. But in many 
parts of Texas, as in some other parts of the country, a ton of buildable 
land existed. This abundance of land and available credit inevitably led to 
overbuilding. When the supply of anything expands at a much faster rate 
than demand, prices usually fall.
Upward pressure on real estate prices tends to be greatest in areas with little 
buildable land. This characteristic was one of the things that attracted me to 
real estate in the San Francisco Bay Area decades ago. If you look at a map of 
this area, you can see that the city of San Francisco and the communities to 
the south are on a peninsula. Ocean, bay inlets, and mountains bound the 
rest of the Bay Area. More than 80 percent of the land in the greater Bay Area 
isn’t available for development because state and federal government parks, 
preserves, and other areas protect the land from development or the land is 
impossible to develop. Of the land available for development, nearly all of it 
in San Francisco and the vast majority of it in nearby counties had been 
developed.
In the long term, the lack of buildable land in an area can be a problem. 
Real estate prices that are too high may cause employers and employees to 
relocate to less expensive areas. If you want to invest in real estate in an 
area with little buildable land and sky-high prices, run the numbers to see 
whether the deal makes economic sense. (I explain how to do this later in 
this chapter.)
 
In addition to buildable land, consider these other important real estate 
market indicators to get a sense of the health, or lack thereof, of a 
particular market:
 
 Building permits: The trend in the number of building permits tells you 
how the supply of real estate properties may soon change. A long and 
sustained rise in permits over several years can indicate that the supply 
of new property may dampen future price appreciation.
 
 Vacancy rates: If few rentals are vacant, that means more competition 
and demand for existing units, which bodes well for future real estate 
price appreciation. Conversely, high vacancy rates indicate an excess 
supply of real estate, which may put downward pressure on rental rates 
as many landlords compete to attract tenants.

219
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
 
 Listings of property for sale and number of sales: Just as the construc-
tion of many new buildings is bad for future real estate price apprecia-
tion, increasing numbers of property listings are also an indication of 
potential future trouble. As property prices reach high levels, some 
investors decide that they can make more money cashing in and invest-
ing elsewhere. When the market is flooded with listings, prospective 
buyers can be choosier, exerting downward pressure on prices. At high 
prices (relative to the cost of renting), more prospective buyers elect to 
rent, and the number of sales relative to listings drops.
 
 A sign of a healthy real estate market is a decreasing and relatively low 
level of property listings, indicating that the demand from buyers meets 
or exceeds the supply of property for sale from sellers. When the cost of 
buying is relatively low compared with the cost of renting, more renters 
can afford and choose to purchase, thus increasing the number of sales.
 
 Rents: The trend in rental rates that renters are willing and able to pay 
over the years gives a good indication as to the demand for housing. 
When the demand for housing keeps up with the supply of housing and 
the local economy continues to grow, rents generally increase. This 
increase is a positive sign for continued real estate price appreciation. 
Beware of buying rental property subject to rent control — the 
property’s expenses may rise faster than you can raise the rents.
Examining property valuation 
and financial projections
How do you know what a property is really worth? Some say it’s worth what 
a ready, willing, and financially able buyer is willing to pay. But some buyers 
pay more than what a property is truly worth. And sometimes buyers who 
are patient, do their homework, and bargain hard are able to buy property 
for less than its fair market value.
 
Crunching some numbers to figure what revenue and expenses a rental prop-
erty may bring is one of the most important exercises that you can go through 
when you determine a property’s worth and decide whether you should buy 
it. In the sections that follow, I walk you through these important calculations.
Examining and estimating cash flow
Cash flow is the difference between the money that a property brings in 
minus what goes out for its expenses. If you pay so much for a property that 
its expenses (including the mortgage payment and property taxes) consis-
tently exceed its income, you have a money drain on your hands. Maybe you 
have the financial reserves to withstand the temporary drain for the first few 
years, but you need to know upfront what you’re getting yourself into.

220
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
One of the biggest mistakes that novice rental property investors make 
is in failing to realize all the costs associated with investment property. In 
the worst cases, some investors end up in personal bankruptcy from the 
drain of negative cash flow (expenses exceeding income). In other cases, I’ve 
seen negative cash flow hamper people’s ability to accomplish important 
financial goals.
The second biggest mistake rental property investors make is in believing the 
financial statements that sellers and their real estate agents prepare. Just as 
an employer views a resume, you should always view such financial state-
ments as advertisements rather than sources of objective information. In 
some cases, sellers and agents lie. In most cases, these statements contain 
lots of projections and best-case scenarios.
 
For property that you’re considering purchasing, ask for a copy of Schedule E 
(Supplemental Income and Losses) from the property seller’s federal income 
tax return. When most people complete their tax returns, they try to minimize 
their revenue and maximize their expenses — the opposite of what they and 
their agents normally do on the statements they sometimes compile to hype 
the property sale. Confidentiality and privacy aren’t an issue when you ask for 
Schedule E because you’re asking only for this one schedule and not the person’s 
Refuting the wisdom of buying in the “best” areas
Some people, particularly those in the real 
estate business, say, “Buy real estate in the 
best school districts” or “Buy the least expen-
sive home in the best neighborhood.” 
Conventional wisdom is often wrong, and these 
examples prove that.
Remember that as a real estate investor, you 
hope to profit from someday selling your prop-
erties, many years in the future, for a much 
higher price than you purchased them. If you 
buy into the “best,” there may not be as much 
room for growth.
Take school districts, for example. Conventional 
wisdom says that you should look at the test 
scores of different districts and buy real estate 
in the best (that is, highest-score) districts. But 
odds are that real estate in those areas is prob-
ably already priced at a premium level. If things 
deteriorate, such an area may experience more 
decline than an area where property buyers 
haven’t bid prices up into the stratosphere.
The biggest appreciation often comes from 
those areas and properties that benefit the most 
from improvement. Identifying these in advance 
isn’t easy, but look for communities where the 
trend in recent years has been positive. Even 
some “average” areas perform better in terms 
of property value appreciation than today’s 
“best” areas.

221
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
entire income tax return. (If the seller owns more than one rental property for 
which financial data is compiled on Schedule E, he can simply black out this 
other information if he doesn’t want you to see it.)
You should prepare financial statements based on facts and a realistic 
assessment of a property (see Figures 11-1, 11-2, and 11-3). There’s a time and 
a place for unbridled optimism and positive thinking, such as when you’re 
lost in a major snowstorm. If you think pessimistically, you may not make it 
out alive! But deciding whether to buy a rental property is not a life-or-death 
situation. Take your time and do it with your eyes and ears open and with a 
healthy degree of skepticism.
 
The monthly rental property financial statement that you prepare in Figures 
11-1 through 11-3 is for the present. Over time, you hope and expect that 
your rental income will increase faster than the property’s expenses, thus 
increasing the cash flow. If you want, you can use this financial statement for 
future years’ projections as well.

you’ll spend at least 1 to 2 percent of the purchase price per year on
maintenance, repairs, and cleaning. Remember to divide your annual
estimate by 12!
Finding good tenants
takes time and promotion. If you list your rental through rental
brokers, they normally take one month’s rent as their cut. Owners of
larger buildings sometimes have an on-site manager to show vacant
units and deal with maintenance and repairs. Put the monthly pay for
that person on this line or the preceding line. If you provide a below-
market rental rate for an on-site manager, make sure that you factor
this into the rental income section.

The tax law allows you to claim a yearly tax deduction
for depreciation, but remember that you can’t depreciate land. Break
down the purchase of your rental property between the building and
land. You can make this allocation based on the assessed value for
the land and the building or on a real estate appraisal. Residential
property is depreciated over 27½ years (3.64 percent of the building
value per year), and nonresidential property is depreciated over 39
years (2.56 percent of the building value per year). For example, if
you buy a residential rental property for $300,000 and $200,000 of
that is allocated to the building, that means that you can take
$7,273 per year as a depreciation tax deduction ($200,000 x .0364).

:  Although depreciation is a deduction that helps you reduce your profit for tax
purposes, it doesn’t actually cost you money. Your cash flow from a rental property is the revenue minus
your out-of-pocket expenses.
Valuing property
Examining and estimating a property’s cash flow is an important first step 
to figuring a property’s value. But on its own, a building’s cash flow doesn’t 
provide enough information to intelligently decide whether to buy a particu-
lar real estate investment. Just because a property has a positive cash flow 
doesn’t mean that you should buy it. Real estate generally sells for less and 
may have better cash flow in areas that investors expect to earn lower rates 
of appreciation.
In the stock market, you have more clues about a specific security’s worth. 
Most companies’ stocks trade on a daily basis, so you at least have a recent 
sales price to start with. Of course, just because a stock recently traded at 
$20 per share doesn’t mean that it’s worth $20 per share. Investors may be 
overly optimistic or pessimistic.
Just as you should evaluate a stock versus other comparable stocks, so too 
should you compare the asking price of a property with other comparable 
real estate. But what if all real estate is overvalued? Such a comparison 
doesn’t necessarily reveal the state of inflated prices. In addition to compar-
ing a real estate investment property to comparable properties, you need to 
also perform some local area evaluations of whether prices from a historic 
perspective appear too high, too low, or just right. To answer this last 
question, see Chapter 10.

224
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
Here are the pros and cons of the different approaches that you can use to 
value property:
 
 Appraisers: The biggest advantage of hiring an appraiser is that she 
values property for a living. An appraisal also gives you some hard 
numbers to use for negotiating with a seller. Hire a full-time appraiser 
who has experience valuing the type of property that you’re consider-
ing. Ask for examples of a dozen similar properties in the area that she 
has appraised in the past three months.
 
 The drawback of appraisers is that they cost money. A small home may 
cost several hundred dollars to appraise, and a larger multiunit building 
may cost $1,000 or more. The danger is that you can spend money on 
an appraisal for a building that you don’t end up buying.
 
 Real estate agents: If you work with a good real estate agent (I discuss 
how to find one in Chapter 12), ask him to draw up a list of comparable 
properties and help you estimate the value of the property that you’re 
considering buying. The advantage of having your agent help with this 
analysis is that you don’t pay extra for this service.
 
 The drawback of asking an agent what to pay for a property is that 
his commission depends on your buying a property and on the amount 
that you pay for that property. The more you’re willing to pay for a 
property, the more likely the deal flies, and the more the agent makes 
on commission.
 
 Do-it-yourself: If you’re comfortable with numbers and analysis, you 
can try to estimate the value of a property yourself. The hard part is 
identifying comparable properties. It’s usually impossible to find 
identical properties, so you need to find similar properties and then 
make adjustments to their selling price so you can do an apples-to-
apples comparison.
 
 Among the factors that should influence your analysis of comparable 
properties are the date the properties sold; the quality of their location; 
lot size; building age and condition; the number of units; the number 
of rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms; garages; fireplaces; and yard. A 
real estate agent can provide this information, or you can track it down 
for properties that you’ve seen or that you know have recently sold.
 
 For example, if a similar property sold six months ago for $250,000 but 
prices overall have decreased 3 percent in the last six months, subtract 
3 percent from the sales price. Ultimately, you have to attach a value 
or price to each difference between comparable properties and the one 
that you’re considering buying. Through a series of adjustments, you 
can then compare the value of your target property to others that have 
recently sold.

225
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
 
These approaches aren’t mutually exclusive — you probably want to at least 
review the numbers and analysis that an appraiser or real estate agent puts 
together.
Finding the information you need
When you evaluate properties, you need to put on your detective hat. If 
you’re creative and inquisitive, you soon realize that this isn’t a hard game 
to play. You can collect useful information about a property and the area in 
which it’s located in many ways.
 
The first place to begin your inquiries is with the real estate agent who 
listed the property for sale. One thing that most agents love to do is talk and 
schmooze. Try to understand why the seller is selling. This knowledge helps 
you negotiate an offer that’s appealing to the seller.
As for specifics on the property’s financial situation, as I explain in the earlier 
section “Examining and estimating cash flow,” ask the sellers for specific 
independent documents, including Schedule E from their tax return. Hire 
inspectors to investigate the property’s physical condition (I advise you on 
hiring inspectors in Chapter 12).
Local government organizations can be treasure troves of information 
about their communities. You can also see the other recommended sources 
in Chapter 10, as well as some other sources that I suggest earlier in this 
chapter.
Digging for a Good Deal
Everyone likes to get a deal or feel like they bought something at a relatively 
low price. How else can you explain the American retail practice of sales? 
merchandise is first overpriced, and what doesn’t sell quickly enough is then 
marked down to create the illusion that you’re getting a bargain! Some real 
estate sellers and agents do the same thing. They list property for sale at an 
inflated price and then mark it down after they realize that no one will pay 
their asking price. “$30,000 price reduction!” the new listing screams. Of 
course, this reduction isn’t a deal.
Purchasing a piece of real estate at a discount is possible. Without doing 
a lick of work, you can make money simply by purchasing a property at a 
discount — one of the ultimate thrills of capitalism!

226
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Scores of books claim to have the real estate investment strategy that 
can beat the system. Often these promoters claim that you can become a 
multimillionaire through investing in distressed properties. A common 
strategy is to purchase property that a seller has defaulted on or is about 
to default on. Or how about buying a property in someone’s estate through 
probate court? Maybe you’d like to try your hand at investing in a property 
that has been condemned or has toxic-waste contamination!
 
It’s possible to get a good buy and purchase a problem property at a discount 
larger than the cost of fixing the property. However, these opportunities 
are hard to find, and sellers of such properties are often unwilling to sell at a 
discount that’s big enough to leave you much room for profit. If you don’t 
know how to thoroughly and correctly evaluate the property’s problems, you 
can end up overpaying.
In some cases, the strategies that these real estate gurus advocate involve 
taking advantage of people’s lack of knowledge. For example, some people 
don’t know that they can protect the equity in their home through filing 
personal bankruptcy. If you can find a seller in such dire financial straits 
and desperate for cash, you may get a bargain buy on the home. (You may 
struggle with the moral issues of buying property cheaply this way.)
Other methods of finding discounted property take lots of time and digging. 
Some involve cold-calling property owners to see whether they’re interested 
in selling. This method is a little bit like trying to fill a job opening by inter-
viewing people you run into on a street corner. Although you may eventually 
find a good candidate this way, if you factor in the value of your time, the 
deal seems like less of a bargain.
 
Without making things complicated or too risky, you can use some of the 
following time-tested and proven ways to buy real estate at a discount to its 
fair market value:
 
 Find a motivated seller: Be patient and look at lots of properties, 
and sooner or later you’ll come across one that someone needs to sell 
(and these aren’t necessarily the ones advertised as having a motivated 
seller). Perhaps the seller has bought another property and needs the 
money to close on the recent purchase. Having access to sufficient 
financing can help secure such deals.
 
 Buy unwanted properties with fixable flaws: The easiest problems to 
correct are cosmetic. Some sellers and their agents are lazy and don’t 
even bother to clean a property. One single-family home that I bought 
had probably three years’ worth of cobwebs and dust accumulated. 
It seemed like a dungeon at night because half the light bulbs were 
burned out.

227
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
 
 Painting, tearing up old, ugly carpeting, refinishing hardwood floors, 
and putting new plantings in a yard are relatively easy jobs. They make 
the property worth more and make renters willing to pay higher rent. 
Of course, these tasks take money and time, and many buyers aren’t 
interested in dealing with problems. If you have an eye for improving 
property and are willing to invest the time that coordinating the fix-up 
work requires, go for it! Just make sure that you hire someone to con-
duct a thorough property inspection before you buy. (See Chapter 12 for 
more details.)
 
 Be sure to factor in the loss of rental income if you can’t rent a portion 
of the property during the fix-up period. Some investors have gone belly 
up from the double cash drain of fix-up expenses and lost rents.
 
 Buy when the real estate market is depressed: When the economy 
takes a few knocks and investors rush for the exits (like the late 2000s 
downturn), it’s time to go shopping! Buy real estate when prices and 
investor interest are down. During times of depressed markets, obtain-
ing properties that produce a positive cash flow (even in the early 
years) is easier. In Chapter 10, I explain how to spot a depressed market.
 
 Check for zoning opportunities: Sometimes, you can make more 
productive use of a property. For example, you can legally convert some 
multiunit apartment buildings into condominiums. Some single-family 
residences may include a rental unit if local zoning allows for it. A good 
real estate agent, contractor, and the local planning office in the town or 
city where you’re looking at the property can help you identify proper-
ties that you can convert. If you’re not a proponent of development, 
then you probably won’t like this strategy.
 
If you buy good real estate and hold it for the long term, you can earn a 
healthy return from your investment. Over the long haul, having bought a 
property at a discount becomes an insignificant issue. You make money from 
your real estate investments as the market appreciates and as a result of your 
ability to manage your property well. So don’t obsess over buying property at 
a discount and don’t wait for the perfect deal, because it won’t come along.
Recognizing Inferior Real 
Estate “Investments”
Some supposedly “simple” ways to invest in real estate rarely make sense 
because they’re near-certain money losers. In this section, I discuss real 
estate investments that you should generally (but not always) avoid.

228
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Time shares
 
Time shares are near-certain money losers. With a time share, you buy a week 
or two of ownership or usage of a particular unit, usually a condominium, 
in a resort location. If you pay $8,000 for a week of “ownership,” you pay the 
equivalent of more than $400,000 a year for the whole unit ($8,000/week × 52 
weeks). However, a comparable unit nearby may sell for only $150,000. The 
extra markup pays the salespeople’s commissions, administrative expenses, 
and profits for the time-share development company. (This little analysis 
also ignores the not-so-inconsequential ongoing time-share maintenance 
fees, which can easily run $200 per year or more.) People usually get hood-
winked into buying a time share when they’re enjoying a vacation someplace. 
Vacationers are easy prey for salespeople who, often using high-pressure 
sales tactics, want to sell them a souvenir of the trip. The cheese in the 
mousetrap is an offer of something free (for example, a free night’s stay in a 
unit) for going through the sales presentation.
Second/vacation homes
Some folks dream of having a weekend cottage 
or condo — a place that you can retreat to 
when crowded urban or suburban living condi-
tions get on your nerves. When it’s not in use, 
you may rent out your vacation home and earn 
some income to help defray part of the mainte-
nance expenses.
If you can realistically afford the additional 
costs of a second, or vacation, home, I’m not 
going to tell you how to spend your extra cash. 
Investment real estate is property that you rent 
out 90 percent or more of the time. Most 
second-home owners whom I know rent their 
property out very little — 10 percent or less of 
the time. As a result, second homes are usually 
money drains. Even if you do rent your second 
home most of the time, high tenant turnover 
decreases your net rental income.
Now, I have seen some people make a 
decent return with second homes that were 
infrequently rented. Usually, these homes are 
held over many years and located in areas that 
have become increasingly popular.
Part of the allure of a second home is the 
supposed tax benefits. Even when you qualify 
for some or all of them, tax benefits only par-
tially reduce the cost of owning a property. I’ve 
seen more than a few cases in which the 
second home is such a cash drain that it 
prevents its owners from contributing to and 
taking advantage of tax-deductible retirement 
savings plans.
If you don’t rent out a second home property 
most of the time, ask yourself whether you can 
afford such a luxury. Can you accomplish your 
other financial goals — saving for retirement, 
paying for the home in which you live, and so 
on — with this added expense? Keeping a 
second home is more of a consumption than an 
investment decision.

229
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
 
If you can’t live without a time share, consider buying a used one. Many previ-
ous buyers, who almost always have lost much of their original investment, 
try to dump their time shares. This fact tells you something about time 
shares. You may be able to buy a time share from an existing owner at a fair 
price, but why commit yourself to taking a vacation in the same location and 
building at the same time each year? Many time shares let you trade your 
weeks; however, doing so is a hassle, and you’re limited by what time slots 
you can trade for, which are typically dates that other people don’t want.
Limited partnerships
In Chapter 2, I give you good reasons to avoid limited partnerships. High 
sales commissions and ongoing management fees burden limited partner-
ships sold through stockbrokers and financial planners who work on com-
mission. Quality real estate investment trusts (REITs), which I discuss 
earlier in this chapter, are infinitely better alternatives. REITs, unlike limited 
partnerships, are also completely liquid.
Scams
 
Wanting to make a lot of money in a hurry is very American. Real estate inves-
tors with lofty expectations for high returns become bait for various hucksters 
who promise these investors great riches. It’s bad enough when the deck is 
stacked against you. Even worse is to put your money into scams.
First Pension, for example, was an outfit run by loan broker William Cooper 
that bilked investors out of more than $100 million. First Pension was 
sold as a limited partnership that invested in mortgages. Using a Ponzi-type 
(pyramid) scheme, Cooper used the money from new investors to pay divi-
dends to earlier investors. Time shares, a truly terrible investment that I 
discuss earlier in this chapter, have also been subject to bankruptcy and 
fraud problems.
Hundreds of thousands of viewers fall prey annually to infomercial hucksters. 
Among the more infamous real estate infomercial promoters is Tom Vu. At 
his seminars, according to The Los Angeles Times, he says, “Well, if you make 
no money with me, you a loser.” Vu, who came to the United States from 
Vietnam in the mid-1970s, claims to have made a fortune investing in real 
estate by using a fairly simple system. He says that he searches for property 
owners who are in debt up to their eyeballs and offers to buy their properties 
with no money down. By finding desperate sellers, he says, you can buy real 
estate at a big discount from its fair market value.

230
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Vu actually makes his money from running high-priced seminars to teach you 
basic real estate techniques that you can read in a book that costs about $20. 
Vu, however, charges up to $15,000 for a five-day seminar! As if overpaying 
this much isn’t enough, Vu’s former “students,” who filed a number of law-
suits that included a class action suit, say that his methods don’t work and 
that he reneged on his promises to go into partnership on properties that 
they identified. A number of states investigated Vu’s practices, have barred 
further Vu seminars in their state, and are seeking compensation for victims. 
Unfortunately, Vu appears to have moved much of his money overseas. Other 
real estate seminar hucksters such as Robert Allen and Ed Buckley saw their 
seminar enterprises end up in bankruptcy, sunk by the claims of their 
unhappy students.
Other scams also abound. Stephen Murphy was a real estate investor who 
claimed to make a fortune by buying foreclosed commercial real estate and 
wrote and self-published a book to share his techniques with the public. 
Murphy’s organization called the people who bought his book and pitched 
them into collaborating with him on property purchases that supposedly 
would return upwards of 100 percent or more per year. However, Murphy 
had other ideas, and he siphoned off nearly two-thirds of the money for him-
self and for promotion of his books! He even hoodwinked Donald Trump into 
writing praise for his book and work: “I really admire Steve Murphy. . . . Steve 
commands some very wise, intelligent . . . and unique purchasing strategies.” 
I’ll say!
New York attorney Alan Harris also defrauded real estate investors (including 
actress Shirley Jones) out of millions of dollars when he pocketed money that 
was set aside for property investments. The lure: Harris promised investors 
far higher yields than they could get elsewhere.
 
If an investment “opportunity” sounds too good to be true, it is. If you want to 
invest in real estate, avoid the hucksters and invest directly in properties that 
you can control or invest through reputable REITs (or REIT mutual funds), 
which I discuss earlier in this chapter.

I
n this chapter, I discuss issues such as understanding and selecting 
mortgages, working with real estate agents, negotiating, and other impor-
tant details that help you put a real estate deal together. I also provide some 
words of wisdom about taxes and selling your property that may come in 
handy down the road. (In Chapter 10, I cover what you need to know to 
purchase a home, and in Chapter 11, I review the fundamentals of investing 
in real estate.)
Financing Your Real Estate Investments
Unless you’re affluent or buying a low-cost property, you likely need to 
borrow some money, via a mortgage, to finance your property acquisition. 
Without financing, your dream to invest in real estate will remain just that — 
a dream. So first, you’ve got to maximize your chances of getting approved 
for a loan, which, unfortunately, has gotten tougher in the late 2000s because 
of the soft real estate market in many parts of the country. Shopping wisely 
for a good mortgage can save you thousands, perhaps even tens of thou-
sands, of dollars in extra interest and fees. Don’t get saddled with a loan 
that you may not be able to afford someday and that could push you into 
foreclosure or bankruptcy.

232
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Getting your loan approved
Even if you have perfect or near-perfect credit, you may encounter financing 
problems with some properties. And of course, not all real estate buyers 
have a perfect credit history, tons of available cash, and no debt. With the 
soft real estate market of the late 2000s, lenders have tightened credit 
standards to avoid making loans to people likely to default. If you’re one of 
those borrowers who ends up jumping through more hoops than other 
borrowers do to get a loan, don’t give up hope. Few borrowers are perfect 
from a lender’s perspective, and many problems are fixable.
 
The best defense against loan rejection is avoiding it in the first place. To 
head off potential rejection before you apply for the loan, you can sometimes 
disclose to your lender anything that may cause a problem. For example, if 
you already know that your credit report indicates some late payments from 
when you were out of the country for several weeks five years ago, write a 
letter that explains this situation.
Solving down payment problems
Most people, especially when they make their first real estate purchase, are 
strapped for cash. In order to qualify for the most attractive financing, lend-
ers typically require that your down payment be at least 20 percent of the 
property’s purchase price. The best investment property loans sometimes 
require 25 to 30 percent down for the best terms. In addition, you need 
reserve money to pay for other closing costs, such as title insurance and 
loan fees.
 
If you don’t have 20-plus percent of the purchase price available, don’t 
despair — you can still own real estate with the following strategies:
 
 Take out private mortgage insurance: Some lenders may offer you a 
mortgage even though you can put down only 5 to 10 percent of the 
purchase price. These lenders will likely require you to purchase private 
mortgage insurance (PMI) for your loan. This insurance generally costs a 
few hundred dollars per year and protects the lender if you default on 
your loan. (When you do have at least 20 percent equity in the property, 
you can generally eliminate the PMI.)
 
 Dip in to your retirement savings: Some employers allow you to borrow 
against your retirement account balance, under the condition that you 
repay the loan within a set number of years. Subject to eligibility 
requirements, first-time homebuyers can make penalty-free withdrawals 
of up to $10,000 from IRA accounts. (Note: You still must pay regular 
income tax on the withdrawal.)
 
 Postpone your purchase: If you don’t want the cost and strain of extra 
fees and bad mortgage terms, you can also postpone your purchase. Go 
on a financial austerity program and boost your savings rate.

233
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
 
 Consider lower-priced properties: Smaller properties and ones that 
need some work can help keep down the purchase price and the 
required down payment.
 
 Find a partner: Make sure that you write up a legal contract to specify 
what happens if a partner wants out. Family members sometimes make 
good partners. Your parents, grandparents, and maybe even your 
siblings may have some extra cash they’d like to loan, invest, or even 
give to you as a gift!
 
 Look into seller financing: Some property owners or developers may 
finance your purchase with as little as 5 to 10 percent down. However, 
you can’t be as picky about such seller-financed properties because a 
limited supply is available and many that are available need work or 
haven’t yet sold for other reasons.
Improving your credit score
Late payments, missed payments, or debts that you never bothered to pay 
can tarnish your credit report and squelch a lender’s desire to offer you a 
mortgage. If you’re turned down for a loan because of your less-than-stellar 
credit history, request (at no charge to you) a copy of your credit report 
from the lender that turned down your loan.
 
But if you think that your credit history may be a problem, the first thing to do 
is get the facts. By law, you’re entitled to one free credit report per year from 
each of the three consumer credit reporting companies — Equifax, Experian, 
and TransUnion. You can get all three reports at once or space them out 
throughout the year (checking in on one each at four-month intervals). The 
companies have set up one central Web site where you can access these 
reports (www.annualcreditreport.com), or you can call toll-free at 
877-322-8228. Just be careful not to buy the credit services these companies 
will pitch you.
Explain credit report problems to your lender. If the lender is unsympathetic, 
try calling other lenders. Tell them your credit problems upfront and see 
whether you can find one willing to offer you a loan. Mortgage brokers may 
also be able to help you shop for lenders in these cases. (I discuss working 
with mortgage brokers later in this chapter.)
Sometimes you may feel that you’re not in control when you apply for a loan. 
In reality, you can fix a number of credit problems yourself, and you reap 
great rewards (access to better loan terms including lower interest rates) for 
doing so. And you can often explain those that you can’t fix. Remember that 
some lenders are more lenient and flexible than others. Just because one 
mortgage lender rejects your loan application doesn’t mean that all the 
others will as well.

234
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
As for erroneous information listed on your credit report, get on the phone to 
the credit bureaus and start squawking. If specific creditors are the culprits, 
call them too. Keep notes from your conversations and make sure that you 
put your case in writing and add your comments to your credit report. If the 
customer service representatives you talk with are no help, send a letter to 
the president of each company. Let the head honcho know that his or her 
organization caused you problems in obtaining credit. For more information 
on examining and disputing items on your credit report and managing credit 
in general, check out the Federal Trade Commission’s Web site at www.ftc.
gov/credit.
Another common credit problem is having too much consumer debt at the 
time you apply for a mortgage. The more credit card, auto loan, and other 
consumer debt you rack up, the less mortgage you qualify for. If you’re 
turned down for the mortgage, consider it a wake-up call to get rid of this 
high-cost debt. Hang on to the dream of buying real estate and plug away at 
paying off your debts before you attempt another foray into real estate.
To find out more about how credit scores work and techniques to improve 
yours, please see the latest edition of my book Personal Finance For Dummies 
(Wiley).
Dealing with low appraisals
Even if you have sufficient income, a clean credit report, and an adequate 
down payment, the lender may turn down your loan if the appraisal of the 
property that you want to buy comes in lower than you agreed to pay for 
the property.
 
Assuming that you still like the property, renegotiate a lower price with the 
seller by using the low appraisal to strengthen your case. With a low appraisal 
on a property that you already own and are refinancing, you obviously need to 
follow a different path. If you have the cash available, you can simply put more 
money down to get the loan balance to a level for which you qualify. If you 
don’t have the cash, you may need to try another lender or forgo the refinance 
until you save more money or until the property value rises. (I discuss refi-
nancing in more detail later in this chapter.)
In rare cases, lenders sometimes lowball an appraisal (intentionally under-
value) on refinances to sabotage a loan. A lender may do so, for example, if 
your current mortgage is under better terms (from their point of view). If you 
suspect that the lender is sabotaging your appraisal, ask for a copy of your 
appraisal to which you are entitled. If you have comparable sale prices of 
homes from your area that support your case, go back to the lender and see 
what he or she has to say. If you’re still not satisfied, complain to the state 
regulator of mortgage lenders. However, applying for a new mortgage 
through another lender may be much less of a hassle.

235
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
Handling insufficient income
If you’re self-employed or have changed jobs, your current income may not 
resemble your past income or, more importantly, your income may not be 
what a mortgage lender likes to see in respect to the amount that you want to 
borrow. A simple (but often impossible) way around this problem is to make 
a larger down payment. For example, if you put down 30 percent or more, 
you may be able to get a stated-income or no-documentation loan. Because of 
the real estate market downturn and rise in foreclosures in the late 2000s, 
few lenders are willing to make these sorts of loans, but they aren’t extinct 
just yet.
 
If you can’t make a large down payment, another option is to get a cosigner for 
the loan — your relatives may be willing. As long as they aren’t overextended 
themselves, they may be able to help you qualify for a larger loan than you 
can get on your own. As with partnerships, put your agreement in writing so 
that no misunderstandings occur.
Comparing fixed-rate to adjustable-rate 
mortgages
Two major types of mortgages exist: those with a fixed interest rate and 
those with an adjustable rate (known as ARMs, for adjustable-rate mort-
gages). When you buy real estate, you have to choose the type of mortgage 
that best fits your needs. Your choice depends on your financial situation, 
how much risk you’re willing to accept, and the type of property you want to 
purchase. For example, obtaining a fixed-rate loan on a property that lenders 
perceive as a riskier investment is more difficult than getting an ARM for the 
same property.
Locking into fixed-rate mortgages
Fixed-rate mortgages, which are typically for a 15- or 30-year term, have inter-
est rates that stay fixed or level — you lock in an interest rate that doesn’t 
change over the life of your loan. Because the interest rate stays the same, 
your monthly mortgage payment stays the same. You have nothing compli-
cated to track and no uncertainty. Fixed-rate loans give people peace of mind 
and payment stability.
 
Fixed-rate mortgages do, however, carry risks. If interest rates fall significantly 
after you obtain your mortgage and you’re unable to refinance, you face 
the danger of being stuck with a higher-cost mortgage, which could be disas-
trous if you lose your job or if the value of your property decreases. (This 
scenario — declining interest rates and falling real estate values — happened 
to plenty of people in the late 2000s.) Even if you’re able to refinance, 
you’ll probably have to spend significant time and money to complete the 
paperwork.

Understanding adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
In contrast to a fixed-rate mortgage, an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) car-
ries an interest rate that varies over time (based upon a formula the lender 
establishes). Such a mortgage begins with one interest rate, and you may pay 
different rates for every year, possibly even every month, during a 30-year 
mortgage. Thus, the size of your monthly payment fluctuates. Because a 
mortgage payment makes a large dent in most property owners’ checkbooks, 
signing up for an ARM without fully understanding it is fiscally foolish.
The advantage of an ARM is that if you purchase your property during a 
period of higher interest rates, you can start paying your mortgage with a 
relatively low initial interest rate, compared with fixed-rate loans. (In con-
trast, with a fixed-rate mortgage, a mortgage lender takes extra risk in com-
mitting to a fixed-interest rate for 15 to 30 years. To be compensated for 
accepting this additional risk, lenders charge a premium with fixed-rate 
mortgages in case interest rates, which they have to pay on their source of 
funds in the form of deposits, move much higher in future years.)
If interest rates decline, you can capture many of the benefits of lower rates 
without the cost and hassle of refinancing by taking out an ARM.
Beware of balloon loans
Balloon loans generally start the way traditional 
fixed-rate mortgages start. You make level pay-
ments based on a long-term payment schedule, 
over 15 or 30 years, for example. But at a prede-
termined time, usually three to ten years from 
the loan’s inception, the remaining loan balance 
becomes fully due.
Balloon loans may save you money because 
they have a lower interest rate than a longer-
term fixed-rate mortgage and you pay that inter-
est over a shorter period of time. However, 
balloon loans are dangerous — your financial 
situation can change, and you may not be able 
to refinance when your balloon loan is due. 
What if you lose your job or your income drops? 
What if the value of your property drops and the 
appraisal comes in too low to qualify you for a 
new loan? What if interest rates rise and you 
can’t qualify at the higher rate on a new loan? 
You’re still going to have to pay off your balloon 
loan when it comes due.
Sometimes, balloon loans may be the only option 
for the buyer (or so the buyer thinks). Buyers are 
more commonly backed into these loans during 
periods of high interest rates. When a buyer 
can’t afford the payments on a conventional 
mortgage and really wants a particular property, 
a seller may offer a balloon loan.
I recommend avoiding balloon loans. You should 
take a balloon loan if, and only if, such a loan is 
your only financing option, you’ve really done 
your homework to exhaust other financing alter-
natives, and you’re certain that you can refi-
nance when the balloon comes due. If you take 
a balloon loan, get one with as much time as 
possible, preferably seven to ten years, before it 
becomes due.

237
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
Choosing between fixed and 
adjustable mortgages
You can’t predict the future course of interest rates. Even the professional 
financial market soothsayers and investors can’t predict where rates are 
heading. If you could foretell interest rate movements, you could make a 
fortune investing in bonds and interest-rate futures and options. So cast aside 
your crystal ball and ask yourself the following two vital questions to help 
you decide whether a fixed or adjustable mortgage will work best for you.
How comfortable are you with taking risk?
How much of a gamble can you take with the size of your monthly mortgage 
payment? For example, if your job and income are unstable and you need to 
borrow an amount that stretches your monthly budget, you can’t afford 
much risk. If you’re in this situation, stick with fixed-rate mortgages because 
you likely won’t be able to handle a possible increase in interest rates and 
the payment on an ARM.
 
If you’re in a position to take the financial risks that come with an adjustable-
rate mortgage, you have a better chance of saving money with an adjustable- 
rather than fixed-rate loan. Your interest rate starts lower and stays lower if 
the overall level of interest rates stays unchanged. Even if rates go up, they’ll 
likely come back down over the life of your loan. If you can stick with your 
adjustable-rate loan for better and for worse, you may come out ahead in the 
long run.
Adjustables make more sense if you borrow less than you’re qualified for. Or 
perhaps you regularly save a sizable chunk — more than 10 percent — of 
your monthly income. If your income significantly exceeds your spending, 
you may feel less anxiety about fluctuating interest rates. If you do choose an 
adjustable loan, you may be more financially secure if you have a hefty finan-
cial cushion (at least six months’ to as much as a year’s worth of expenses 
reserved) that you can access if rates go up.
 
Almost all adjustables limit, or cap, the rise in the interest rate that your loan 
allows. Typical caps are 2 percent per year and 6 percent over the life of the 
loan. Ask your lender to calculate the highest possible monthly payment that 
your loan allows. The number that the lender comes up with is the payment 
that you face if the interest rate on your loan goes to the highest level allowed, 
or the lifetime cap. If you can’t afford the highest-allowed payment on an 
adjustable-rate mortgage, don’t take one. You shouldn’t take the chance that 
the rate may not rise that high — it can, and you could lose the property.
 
Don’t take an adjustable mortgage because the lower initial interest rates 
allow you to afford the property that you want to buy (unless you’re abso-
lutely certain that your income will rise to meet future payment increases). 
Try setting your sights on a property that you can afford to buy with a 
fixed-rate mortgage.

238
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
How many years do you expect to stay put?
Saving interest on most adjustables is usually a certainty in the first two or 
three years. An adjustable-rate mortgage starts at a lower interest rate than a 
fixed-rate mortgage. If rates rise, you can end up giving back the savings that 
you achieve in the early years of the mortgage.
 
If you aren’t going to keep your mortgage for more than five to seven years, 
you’ll probably end up paying more interest to carry a fixed-rate mortgage.
 
You may also consider a hybrid loan, which combines features of fixed- and 
adjustable-rate mortgages. For example, the initial rate may hold constant for 
several years and then adjust once a year or every six months thereafter. Such 
loans may make sense for you if you foresee a high probability of keeping your 
loan seven years or less but want some stability in your monthly payments. 
The longer the initial rate stays locked in, the higher the interest rate.
Getting a great fixed-rate mortgage
You may think that comparing one fixed-rate loan to another is quite simple 
because the interest rate on a fixed-rate loan is the rate that you pay every 
month over the entire life of the loan. As with your golf score and the number 
of times that your boss catches you showing up late for work, a lower 
number (interest rate) is better, right?
Unfortunately, banks generally charge an upfront interest fee, known as 
points, in addition to the ongoing interest over the life of the loan. Points are 
actually percentages: One point is equal to 1 percent of the loan amount. So 
when a lender tells you a quoted loan has 1.5 points, you pay 1.5 percent of 
the amount you borrow as points. On a $100,000 loan, for example, 1.5 points 
cost you $1,500. The interest rate on a fixed-rate loan must always be quoted 
with the points on the loan, if the loan has points.
 
You may want to take a higher interest rate on your mortgage if you don’t 
have enough cash to pay for a lot of points, which you pay upfront when you 
close the loan. On the other hand, if you’re willing and able to pay more 
points, you can lower your interest rate. You may want to pay more points 
because the interest rate on your loan determines your payments over a long 
period of time — 15 to 30 years.
Suppose that one lender quotes you a rate of 6.75 percent on a 30-year fixed-
rate loan and charges one point (1 percent). Another lender, which quotes 7 
percent for 30 years, doesn’t charge any points. Which is better? The answer 
depends on how long you plan to keep the loan.
The 6.75 percent loan is 0.25 percent less than the 7 percent loan. However, 
it takes you about four years to earn back the savings to cover the cost of 
that point because you have to pay 1 percent (one point) upfront on the 6.75 

239
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
percent loan. So if you expect to keep the loan more than four years, go with 
the 6.75 percent option. If you plan to keep the loan less than four years, go 
with the 7 percent option.
 
To make it easier to perform an apples-to-apples comparison of mortgages 
from different lenders, get interest rate quotes at the same point level. For 
example, ask each lender for the interest rate on a loan for which you pay 
one point.
And, remember that if a loan has no points, it’s sure to have a higher interest 
rate. That’s not to say that no-point loans are better or worse than compara-
ble loans from other lenders, but don’t get sucked into a loan because of a 
no-points sales pitch. Lenders who spend big bucks on advertising these 
types of loans rarely have the best mortgage terms.
All things being equal, no-point loans make more sense for refinances 
because points aren’t immediately tax-deductible as they are on purchases. 
(You can deduct the points that you pay on a refinance only over the life of 
the mortgage.) On a mortgage for a property that you’re purchasing, a no-
point loan may help if you’re cash poor at closing.
Consider a no-point loan if you can’t afford more out-of-pocket expenditures 
now or if you think that you’ll keep the loan only a few years. Shop around 
and compare different lenders’ no-point loans.
Finding a great adjustable-rate mortgage
Selecting an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) has a lot in common with select-
ing a home to buy. You need to make trade-offs and compromises. In the fol-
lowing sections, I explain the numerous features and options — caps, indexes, 
margins, and adjustment periods — that you find with ARMs (these aren’t 
issues with fixed-rate loans).
Getting off to a good start rate
 
Just as the name implies, your start rate is the one that your mortgage begins 
with. Think of the start rate as a teaser rate — the initial rate on ARMs is often 
set artificially low to entice you. Don’t judge an ARM by this rate alone. You 
won’t pay this attractively low rate for long. With ARMs, interest rates gener-
ally rise as soon as the terms of the mortgage allow. Even if the market level of 
interest rates doesn’t change, your adjustable rate is destined to increase. An 
increase of one or two percentage points is common.
The formula for determining the future interest rates on an adjustable-rate 
mortgage (see the following section) and the rate caps are far more impor-
tant in determining what a mortgage is going to cost you in the long run. 
For more on rate caps, see the section “Analyzing adjustments,” later in 
this chapter.

240
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Determining your future interest rate
The first thing that you need to ask a mortgage lender or broker about an 
adjustable rate is the formula for determining the future interest rate on your 
loan. You need to know exactly how a lender figures how your interest rate 
changes over the life of the loan. All adjustables are based on the following 
formula, which specifies how the interest rate is set on your loan in the 
future:
index + margin = interest rate
The index determines the base level of interest rates that the mortgage con-
tract specifies in order to calculate the specific interest rate for your loan. 
Indexes are generally (but not always) widely quoted in the financial press. 
For example, suppose that the current index value for a given loan is equal to 
the six-month treasury bill index, which is, say, 2 percent. The margin is the 
amount added to the index to determine the interest rate that you pay on 
your mortgage. Most loans have margins of around 2.5 percent. Thus, the 
rate of a mortgage driven by the following formula
six-month Treasury bill rate + 2.5 percent
is set at 2 + 2.5 = 4.5 percent. This figure is known as the fully indexed rate. 
If the start rate for this loan is just 3 percent, you know that if the index 
(six-month treasuries) stays at the same level, your loan will increase to 4.5 
percent.
 
Compare the fully indexed rate to the current rate for fixed-rate loans. During 
particular time periods, you may be surprised to discover that the fixed-rate 
loan is at about the same interest rate or even a tad lower. This insight may 
cause you to reconsider your choice of an adjustable-rate loan, which can, of 
course, rise to an even higher rate in the future.
Understanding common indexes for adjustable-rate mortgages
The different indexes vary mainly in how rapidly they respond to changes in 
interest rates. Some common indexes include:
 
 Treasury bills: T-bills are IOUs (bonds) that the U.S. government issues. 
Most adjustables are tied to the interest rate on 6-month or 12-month 
T-bills. T-bill interest rates move relatively quickly.
 
 Certificates of deposit: CDs are interest-bearing bank investments that 
lock you in for a specific period of time. ARMs are usually tied to the 
average interest rate that banks are paying on six-month CDs. Like 
T-bills, CDs tend to respond quickly to changes in the market’s level of 
interest rates.
 
 The 11th District cost of funds: The cost of funds index (COFI) is among 
the slower-moving indexes. Adjustable-rate mortgages tied to the 11th 
District (a Western region of several states) cost of funds tend to start 

241
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
out at a higher interest rate. A slower-moving index has the advantage of 
moving up less quickly when rates are on the rise. On the other hand, 
you have to be patient to benefit from falling interest rates.
If you select an adjustable-rate mortgage that’s tied to one of the faster-
moving indexes, you take on more of a risk that the next adjustment may 
reflect interest rate increases. Because you take on more of the risk that 
interest rates may increase, lenders cut you breaks in other ways, such as 
through lower caps or points.
Should you want the security of an ARM tied to a slower-moving index, you’ll 
pay for that security in one form or another, such as a higher start rate, caps, 
margin, or points.
 
Trying to predict interest rates is a dangerous game. When selecting a 
mortgage, keeping sight of your own financial situation is far more important 
than trying to guess future interest rates.
Analyzing adjustments
After the initial interest rate expires, the interest rate on an ARM fluctuates 
based on the loan formula. Most adjustables adjust every 6 or 12 months, but 
some may adjust as frequently as monthly. In advance of each adjustment, 
the lender sends you a notice telling you your new rate.
All things being equal, the less frequently your loan adjusts, the less financial 
uncertainty you have in your life. However, less-frequent adjustments usually 
mean that your loan starts at a higher interest rate.
Almost all adjustables come with an adjustment cap, which limits the maxi-
mum rate change (up or down) at each adjustment. On most loans that 
adjust every six months, the adjustment cap is 1 percent. In other words, the 
interest rate that the loan charges can move up or down no more than one 
percentage point in a given adjustment period.
Loans that adjust more than once per year usually limit the maximum rate 
change that’s allowed over the entire year as well. On the vast majority of 
such loans, 2 percent is the annual rate cap. Likewise, almost all adjustables 
come with lifetime caps. These caps limit the highest rate allowed over the 
entire life of the loan. It’s common for adjustable loans to have lifetime caps 5 
to 6 percent higher than the initial start rate.
 
Never take an ARM without rate caps! Doing so is worse than giving a credit 
card with an unlimited line of credit to your teenager for the weekend — 
at least you get the credit card back on Monday! When you want to take an 
adjustable-rate mortgage, you must identify the maximum payment that 
you can handle. If you can’t handle the highest allowed payment, don’t look 
at ARMs.

242
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Avoiding negative amortization ARMs
 
As you make mortgage payments over time, the loan balance you still owe is 
gradually reduced or amortized. Negative amortization — increasing your loan 
balance — is the reverse of this process. Some ARMs allow negative amortiza-
tion. How can your outstanding loan balance grow when you continue to make 
mortgage payments? This phenomenon occurs when your mortgage payment 
is less than it really should be.
Some loans cap the increase of your monthly payment but don’t cap the 
interest rate. Thus, the size of your mortgage payment may not reflect all the 
interest that you owe on your loan. So rather than paying the interest that 
you owe and paying off some of your loan balance (or principal) every 
month, you end up paying off some, but not all, of the interest that you owe. 
Thus, lenders add the extra, unpaid interest that you still owe to your out-
standing debt.
Negative amortization resembles paying only the minimum payment that 
your credit card bill requires. You continue to rack up finance charges (in 
this case, greater interest) on the balance as long as you make only the artifi-
cially low payment. Taking a loan with negative amortization defeats the 
whole purpose of borrowing an amount that fits your overall financial goals.
 
Avoid adjustables with negative amortization. The only way to know whether 
a loan includes negative amortization is to explicitly ask. Most lenders and 
mortgage brokers aren’t forthcoming about telling you. You find negative 
amortization more frequently on loans that lenders consider risky. If you have 
trouble finding lenders that will deal with your financial situation, make sure 
that you’re especially careful.
Understanding other mortgage fees
 
In addition to points and the ongoing interest rate, lenders tack on all sorts 
of other upfront charges in processing your loan. Get an itemization of 
these other fees and charges in writing from all lenders that you’re seriously 
considering (I explain how to find the best lenders for your needs in the next 
section). You need to know the total of all lender fees so you can accurately 
compare different lenders’ loans and determine how much closing on your 
loan will cost you. Other mortgage fees can pile up in a hurry. Here are the 
common ones you may see:
 
 Application and processing fees: Most lenders charge a few hundred 
dollars to work with you to complete your paperwork and funnel it 
through their loan evaluation process. Should your loan be rejected, 
or if it’s approved and you decide not to take it, the lender needs to 
cover its costs. Some lenders return this fee to you upon closing with 
their loan.

243
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
 
 Credit report charge: Most lenders charge you for the cost of obtaining 
your credit report, which tells the lender whether you’ve repaid other 
loans on time. Your credit report should cost about $50.
 
 Appraisal fee: The property for which you borrow money needs to be 
valued. If you default on your mortgage, a lender doesn’t want to get 
stuck with a property that’s worth less than you owe. The cost for an 
appraisal typically ranges from several hundred dollars for most resi-
dential properties to as much as $1,000 or more for larger investment 
properties.
Some lenders offer loans without points or other lender charges. Remember: 
If they don’t charge points or other fees, they charge a higher interest rate on 
your loan to make up the difference. Such loans may make sense for you 
when you lack the cash to close a loan or when you plan to hold on to the 
loan for just a few years.
 
To minimize your chances of throwing money away on a loan that you may 
not qualify for, ask the lender whether there is any reason your loan request 
may be denied. Be sure to disclose any problems on your credit report or any 
problems with the property that you’re aware of. Lenders may not take the 
time to ask about these sorts of things in their haste to get you to complete 
their loan applications.
Finding the best lenders
You can easily save thousands of dollars in interest charges and other fees if 
you shop around for a mortgage deal. It doesn’t matter whether you do so on 
your own or hire someone to help you, but you should shop because much 
money is at stake!
Shopping yourself
Many mortgage lenders compete for your business. Although having a large 
number of lenders to choose from is good for keeping interest rates lower, it 
also makes shopping a chore.
Real estate agents can refer you to lenders with whom they’ve done business. 
Those lenders don’t necessarily offer the most competitive rates — the agent 
simply may have done business with them in the past or received client 
referrals from them.
 
Look in the real estate section of a large, local Sunday newspaper for charts of 
selected area lender interest rates. Just as with Internet sites that advertise 
lender rates, these tables are by no means comprehensive or reflective of the 
best rates available. In fact, many of these rates are sent to newspapers for 
free by firms that distribute mortgage information to mortgage brokers. Use 
them as a starting point and call the lenders that list the best rates.

244
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
HSH Associates (800-873-2837; www.hsh.com) publishes mortgage 
information for many major metropolitan areas. The cost is just $10.
Shopping through a mortgage broker
A competent mortgage broker can be a big help in getting you a good loan 
and closing the deal, especially if you’re too busy or disinterested to dig for a 
good deal on a mortgage. A good mortgage broker also keeps abreast of the 
many different mortgages in the marketplace. He or she can shop among lots 
of lenders to get you the best deal available. The following list presents some 
additional advantages to working with a mortgage broker:
 
 An organized and detail-oriented mortgage broker can help you through 
the process of completing all those tedious documents that lenders 
require.
 
 Mortgage brokers can help polish your loan package so the information 
you present is favorable yet truthful.
 
 The best brokers can also help educate you about various loan options 
and the pros and cons of available features.
 
Be careful when you choose a mortgage broker, because some brokers are 
lazy and don’t shop the market for the best current rates. Even worse, some 
brokers may direct their business to specific lenders so they can take a bigger 
cut or commission.
A mortgage broker typically gets paid a percentage, usually 0.5 to 1 percent, 
of the loan amount. This commission is completely negotiable, especially on 
larger loans that are more lucrative.
 
You need to ask what the commission is on loans that a broker pitches. Some 
brokers may be indignant that you ask — that’s their problem. You have every 
right to ask — it’s your money.
Even if you plan to shop on your own, talking to a mortgage broker may be 
worthwhile. At the very least, you can compare what you find with what bro-
kers say they can get for you. Again, be careful. Some brokers tell you what 
you want to hear — that is, that they can beat your best find — and then 
can’t deliver when the time comes.
If your loan broker quotes you a really good deal, make sure that you ask 
who the lender is. (Most brokers refuse to reveal this information until you 
pay the necessary fee to cover the appraisal and credit report.) You can 
check with the actual lender to verify the interest rate and points that the 
broker quotes you and make sure that you’re eligible for the loan.

245
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
Refinancing for a better deal
When you buy a property, you take out a mortgage based on your circum-
stances and available loan options at that time. But things change. Maybe 
interest rates have dropped, or you have access to better loan options now 
than when you first purchased. Or perhaps you want to tap in to some of 
your real estate equity for other investments.
If interest rates drop and you’re able to refinance, you can lock in interest 
rate savings. But a lower interest rate since you took out your original mort-
gage isn’t reason enough to refinance your mortgage. Remember that when 
you refinance a mortgage, you have to spend money and time to save money. 
So you need to crunch a few numbers to determine whether refinancing 
makes sense for you.
 
Calculate how many months it will take you to recoup the costs of refinancing, 
such as appraisal costs, loan fees and points, title insurance, and so on. For 
example, if the refinance costs you $2,000 to complete and reduces your 
monthly payment by $100, it may appear that you can make the cost of the 
refinance back in 20 months. However, because you lose some tax write-offs if 
you reduce your mortgage interest rate and payment, you can’t simply look at 
the reduced amount of your monthly payment.
If you want a better estimate but don’t want to spend hours crunching num-
bers, take your tax rate as specified in Chapter 3 (for example, 27 percent) 
and reduce your monthly payment savings on the refinance by this amount. 
That means, continuing with the example in the preceding paragraph, that if 
your monthly payment drops by $100, you’re actually saving only around $73 
a month after you factor in the lost tax benefits. So it takes about 28 months 
($2,000 divided by $73), not 20 months, to recoup the refinance costs.
 
Consider refinancing when you can recover the costs of the refinance within a 
few years or less and you don’t plan to move in that time frame. Should it take 
longer to recoup the refinance costs, refinancing may still make sense if you 
anticipate keeping the property and mortgage that long. If you estimate that 
breaking even will take more than five to seven years, refinancing is probably 
too risky to justify the costs and hassles.
Refinancing a piece of real estate that you own to pull out cash for some 
other purpose can make good financial sense because under most circum-
stances, mortgage interest is tax-deductible. Perhaps you want to purchase 
another piece of real estate, start or purchase a business, or get rid of some 
high-cost consumer debt on credit cards or an auto loan. The interest on 
consumer debt is not tax-deductible and is usually at a much higher interest 
rate than what mortgage loans charge you.

246
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
Be careful that you don’t borrow more than you need to accomplish your 
financial goals. For example, just because you can borrow more against the 
equity in your real estate doesn’t mean that you should do so to buy an 
expensive new car or take your dream vacation.
Working with Real Estate Agents
When you purchase real estate, if you’re like most people, you enlist the 
services of a real estate agent. A good agent can help screen property so you 
don’t spend all of your free time looking at potential properties, negotiating a 
deal, helping coordinate inspections, and managing other preclosing items.
Recognizing agent conflicts of interest
All real estate agents, good, mediocre, and awful, are subject to a conflict of 
interest because of the way they’re compensated — on commission. I must 
say that I respect real estate agents for calling themselves what they are. Real 
estate agents don’t hide behind an obscure job title, such as “shelter consul-
tant.” (Many financial “planners,” “advisors,” or “consultants,” for example, 
actually work on commission and sell investments and life insurance and, 
therefore, are really stockbrokers and insurance brokers, not planners or 
advisors.)
When to consider a home equity loan
Home equity loans, also known as second mort-
gages, allow you to borrow against the equity in 
your home in addition to the mortgage that you 
already have (a first mortgage).
A home equity loan may benefit you if you need 
more money for just a few years or if your first 
mortgage is at such a low interest rate that refi-
nancing it to get more cash would be too costly. 
Otherwise, I advise you to avoid home equity 
loans.
If you need a larger mortgage, why not refi-
nance the first one and wrap it all together? 
Home equity loans have higher interest rates 
than comparable first mortgages. That’s 
because they’re riskier from a lender’s perspec-
tive because the first mortgage lender gets first 
claim against your property if you file bank-
ruptcy or you default on the mortgage.
Interest on home mortgage loans of up to $1 million 
(first or second residences) is tax-deductible 
for loans taken out after October 13, 1987. 
(Loans taken before that date have no monetary 
limit.) Interest deduction on home equity loans 
is limited to the first $100,000 of such debt.

247
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
Real estate agents aren’t in the business of providing objective financial 
counsel. Just as car dealers make their living selling cars, real estate agents 
make their living selling real estate. Never forget this fact as a buyer.
 
The pursuit of a larger commission may encourage an agent to get you to do 
things that aren’t in your best interests, such as the following:
 
 Buy, and buy sooner rather than later: If you don’t buy, your agent 
doesn’t get paid for all the hours she spends working with you. The 
worst agents fib and use tricks to motivate you to buy. They may say 
that other offers are coming in on a property that interests you, or they 
may show you a bunch of dumps and then one good listing to motivate 
you to buy the one good listing.
 
 Spend more than you should: Because real estate agents get a percent-
age of the sales price of a property, they have a built-in incentive to 
encourage you to spend more on a property than what fits comfortably 
with your other financial objectives and goals. An agent doesn’t have to 
consider or care about your other financial needs.
 
 Purchase their company’s listings: Agents also have a built-in incentive 
(higher commission) to sell their own listings.
 
 Buy in their territory: Real estate agents typically work a specific 
territory. As a result, they usually can’t objectively tell you the pros 
and cons of the surrounding region.
 
 Use people who scratch their backs: Some agents refer you to brokers, 
lenders, inspectors, and title insurance companies that have referred 
customers to them. Some agents also solicit and receive referral fees 
(or bribes) from mortgage lenders, inspectors, and contractors to whom 
they refer business.
Finding a good agent
A mediocre, incompetent, or greedy agent can be a real danger to your 
finances. Whether you’re hiring an agent to work with you as a buyer or 
seller, you want someone who is competent and with whom you can get 
along. Working with an agent costs a good deal of money, so make sure you 
get your money’s worth.
 
Interview several agents and check references. Ask agents for the names 
and phone numbers of at least three clients with whom they’ve worked in the 
past six months in the geographical area in which you’re looking. By narrow-
ing the period during which they worked with references to six months, you 
maximize the chances of speaking with clients other than the agent’s all-time-
favorite clients.

248
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
As you speak with an agent’s references, look for these traits in any agent 
that you’re considering working with, whether as a buyer or seller:
 
 Full-time employment: Some agents work in real estate as a second or 
even third job. Information in this field changes constantly — keeping 
track of it is hard enough on a full-time basis. It’s hard to imagine a 
good agent being able to stay on top of the market while moonlighting 
elsewhere.
 
 Experience: Hiring someone with experience doesn’t necessarily mean 
looking for an agent who’s been an agent for decades. Many of the best 
agents come into the field from other occupations, such as business and 
teaching. Agents can acquire some sales, marketing, negotiation, and 
communication skills in other fields, but experience in real estate 
does count.
 
 Honesty and integrity: You need to trust your agent with a lot of infor-
mation. If the agent doesn’t level with you about what a neighborhood 
or particular property is really like, you suffer the consequences.
 
 Interpersonal skills: An agent must get along not only with you but also 
with a whole host of other people who are involved in a typical real 
estate deal: other agents, property sellers, inspectors, mortgage lenders, 
and so on. An agent needs to know how to put your interests first 
without upsetting others.
 
 Negotiation skills: Putting a real estate deal together involves negotia-
tion. Is your agent going to exhaust all avenues to get you the best deal 
possible? Most people don’t like the sometimes aggravating process of 
negotiation, so they hire someone else to do it for them. Be sure to ask 
the agent’s former client references how the agent negotiated for them.
 
 High quality standards: Sloppy work can lead to big legal or logistical 
problems down the road. If an agent neglects to recommend an inspec-
tion, for example, you may get stuck with undiscovered problems after 
the deal is done.
Agents who pitch themselves as buyer’s brokers claim that they work for 
your interests. Agents who represent you as buyer’s brokers still get paid 
only when you buy. And agents still get paid a commission that’s a percent-
age of the purchase price. So they still have an incentive to sell you a piece of 
real estate that’s more expensive because their commission increases.
 
Some agents market themselves as top producers, which means that they sell a 
relatively larger volume of real estate. This title doesn’t count for much for 
you, the buyer. In fact, you may use this information as a potential red flag for 
an agent who focuses on completing as many deals as possible. Such an agent 
may not be able to give you the time and help that you need to get the house 
you want.

249
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
When you buy a home, you need an agent who is patient and who allows you 
the necessary time to educate yourself and helps you make the decision 
that’s best for you. The last thing you need or want is an agent who tries to 
push you into making a deal.
You also need an agent who is knowledgeable about the local market and 
community. If you want to buy a home in an area where you don’t currently 
live, an informed agent can have a big impact on your decision.
 
Finding an agent with financing knowledge is a plus for buyers, especially first-
time buyers or those with credit problems. Such an agent may be able to refer 
you to lenders that can handle your type of situation, which can save you a lot 
of legwork.
Closing the Deal
After you locate a property that you want to buy and understand your 
financing options, the real fun begins. Now you have to put the deal together. 
The following sections discuss key things to keep in mind.
Negotiating 101
When you work with an agent, the agent usually carries the burden of the 
negotiation process. But even if you delegate responsibility for negotiating to 
your agent, you still should have a strategy in mind. Otherwise, you may 
overpay for real estate.
Buying without a real estate agent
You can purchase property without an agent 
if you’re willing to do some additional legwork. 
You need to do the things that a good real estate 
agent does, such as searching for properties, 
scheduling appointments to see them, deter-
mining fair market value, negotiating the deal, 
and coordinating inspections.
If you don’t work with an agent, have an attor-
ney review the various contracts, unless you’re 
a legal expert. Having someone else not vested 
in the transaction look out for your interests 
helps your situation. Real estate agents gener-
ally aren’t legal experts, so getting legal advice 
from an attorney is generally better. (In some 
states, you need to hire an attorney in addition 
to the real estate agent.)
One possible drawback to working without an 
agent is performing the negotiations yourself. 
Negotiating can be problematic if you lack 
these skills or get too caught up emotionally in 
the situation.

250
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
Find out about the property and the owner before you make your offer. How 
long has the property been on the market? What are its flaws? Why is the 
owner selling? The more you understand about the property you want to buy 
and the seller’s motivations, the better your ability is to draft an offer that 
meets everyone’s needs. Some listing agents love to talk and will tell you the 
life history of the seller. Either you or your agent may be able to get them to 
reveal helpful information about the seller.
 
Also, bring facts to the bargaining table. Get comparable sales data to support 
your price. Too often, homebuyers and their agents pick a number out of the 
air when they make an offer. If you were the seller, would you be persuaded 
to lower your asking price? Pointing to recent and comparable home sales to 
justify your offer price strengthens your case.
Remember that price is only one of several negotiable items. Sometimes sell-
ers fixate on selling their homes for a certain amount. Perhaps they want to 
get at least what they paid for it themselves several years ago. You may get a 
seller to pay for certain repairs or improvements or to offer you an attractive 
loan without all the extra fees that a bank charges. Also, be aware that the 
time for closing on the purchase is a bargaining point. Some sellers may need 
cash soon and may concede other terms if you can close quickly. Likewise, 
the real estate agent’s commission is negotiable.
Finally, try to leave your emotions out of any property purchase. This is 
easier said than done and hardest to do when you purchase a home in which 
you’ll live. Try, as best you can, not to fall in love with a property. Keep 
searching for other properties even when you make an offer because you 
may be negotiating with an unmotivated seller.
Inspecting the property
Unless you’ve built homes and other properties and performed contracting 
work yourself, you probably have no idea what you’re getting yourself into 
when it comes to furnaces and termites.
 
Spend the money and time to hire inspectors and other experts to evaluate 
the major systems and potential problem areas of the home. Because you 
can’t be certain of the seller’s commitment, I recommend that you do the 
inspections after you’ve successfully negotiated and signed a sales contract. 
Although you won’t have the feedback from the inspections to help with this 
round of negotiating, you can always go back to the seller with the new infor-
mation. Make your purchase offer contingent on a satisfactory inspection.
Hire people to help you inspect the following features of the property. (With 
multiunit rental property, be sure to read Chapter 11 for other specifics that 
you need to check out, such as parking.)

251
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
 
 Overall condition of the property (for example, is the paint peeling, are 
the floors level, are appliances present and working well, and so on?)
 
 Electrical, heating and air conditioning, and plumbing systems
 
 Foundation
 
 Roof
 
 Pest control and dry rot
 
 Seismic/slide/flood risk
Inspection fees often pay for themselves. If you uncover problems that you 
weren’t aware of when you negotiated the original purchase price, the inspec-
tion reports give you the information you need to go back and ask the prop-
erty seller to fix the problems or reduce the property’s purchase price.
 
Never accept a seller’s inspection report as your only source of information. 
When a seller hires an inspector, he or she may hire someone who isn’t as 
diligent and critical of the property. Review the seller’s inspection reports if 
available, but get your own as well. Also, beware of inspectors who are popu-
lar with real estate agents. They may be popular because they don’t bother to 
document all the property’s problems.
As with other professionals whose services you retain, interview a few differ-
ent inspection companies. Ask which systems they inspect and how detailed 
a report they can prepare for you. Consider asking the company that you’re 
thinking of hiring for customer references. Ask for names and phone numbers 
of three people who used the company’s services within the past six months. 
Also, request from each inspection company a sample of one of its reports.
 
The day before you close on the purchase, take a brief walk-through of the 
property to make sure that everything is still in the condition it was before 
and that all the fixtures, appliances, curtains, and other items the contract 
lists are still there. Sometimes, sellers ignore or don’t recall these things, and 
consequently, they don’t leave what they agreed to in the sales contract.
Shopping for title insurance 
and escrow services
Mortgage lenders require title insurance to protect against someone else 
claiming legal title to your property. This can happen, for example, when a 
husband and wife split up, and the one who remains in the home decides to 
sell and take off with the money. If the title lists both spouses as owners, the 
spouse who sells the property (possibly by forging the other’s signature) has 
no legal right to do so. The other spouse can come back and reclaim rights to 
the home even after it has been sold. In this event, both you and the lender 

252
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
can get stuck holding the bag. (If you’re in the enviable position of paying 
cash for a property, buying title insurance is still wise, even though a mort-
gage lender won’t prod you to do so. You need to protect your investment.)
 
Title insurance and escrow fees may vary from company to company. (Escrow 
charges pay for neutral third-party services to ensure that the instructions of 
the purchase contract or refinance are fulfilled and that everyone gets paid.) 
Don’t simply use the company that your real estate agent or mortgage lender 
suggests — shop around. When you call around for title insurance and escrow 
fee quotes, make sure that you understand all the fees. Many companies tack 
on all sorts of charges for things such as courier fees and express mail. If you 
find a company with lower prices and want to use it, consider asking for an 
itemization in writing so you don’t receive any unpleasant surprises.
An insurance company’s ability to pay claims is always important. Most state 
insurance departments monitor and regulate title insurance companies. Title 
insurers rarely fail, and most state departments of insurance do a good job 
shutting down financially unstable ones. Check with your state’s department 
if you’re concerned. You can also ask the title insurer for copies of its ratings 
from insurance-rating agencies.
Selling Real Estate
 
You should buy and hold real estate for the long term. If you do your home-
work, buy in a good area, and work hard to find a fairly priced or underpriced 
property, why sell it quickly and incur all the selling costs, time, and hassle to 
locate and negotiate another property to purchase?
Some real estate investors like to buy properties in need of improvement, fix 
them up, and then sell them and move on to another. Unless you’re a con-
tractor or experienced real estate investor and have a real eye for this type 
of work, don’t expect to make a windfall or even to earn back more than the 
cost of the improvements. The process of buying, fixing, and flipping can be 
profitable, but it’s not as easy as the home-improvement television shows 
and some books would have you believe. In fact, it’s more likely that you’ll 
erode your profit through the myriad costs of frequent buying and selling. 
The vast majority of your profits should come from the long-term apprecia-
tion of the overall real estate market in the communities that you own 
property in.
Use the reasons that you bought in an area as a guide if you think you want to 
sell. Use the criteria that I discuss in Chapter 11 as a guideline. For example, 
if the schools in the community are deteriorating and the planning depart-
ment is allowing development that will hurt the value of your property and 
the rents that you can charge, you may have cause to sell. Unless you see sig-
nificant problems like these in the future, holding good properties over many 
years is a great way to build your wealth and minimize transaction costs.

253
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
Negotiating real estate agents’ contracts
Most people use an agent to sell real estate. As I discuss in “Finding a good 
agent,” earlier in this chapter, selling and buying a home demand agents with 
different strengths. When you sell a property, you want an agent who can get 
the job done efficiently and for as high a sales price as possible.
 
As a seller, you should seek agents who have marketing and sales expertise 
and who are willing to put in the time and money necessary to sell your house. 
Don’t be impressed by an agent just because she works for a large company. 
What matters more is what the agent can do to market your property.
When you list a property for sale, the contract that you sign with the listing 
agent includes specification of the commission that you pay the agent if 
he succeeds in selling your property. In most areas of the country, agents 
usually ask for a 6 percent commission for single-family homes. In an area 
that maintains lower-cost housing, agents may ask for 7 percent. For small 
multifamily properties and commercial properties, commissions are often 
in the 3 to 5 percent range.
 
Regardless of the commission an agent says is “typical,” “standard,” or “what 
my manager requires,” always remember that you can negotiate commissions. 
Because the commission is a percentage, you have much greater ability to get 
a lower commission on a higher-priced property. If an agent makes 6 percent 
selling both a $200,000 and a $100,000 property, the agent makes twice as 
much on the $200,000 property. Yet selling the higher-priced property doesn’t 
usually take twice as much work.
If you live in an area with higher-priced properties, you may be able to negoti-
ate a 5 percent commission. For expensive properties, a 4 percent commis-
sion is reasonable. You may find, however, that your ability to negotiate a 
lower commission is greatest when an offer is on the table. Because of the 
cooperation of agents who work together through the multiple listing service 
(MLS), if you list your real estate for sale at a lower commission than most 
other properties, some agents won’t show it to prospective buyers. For this 
reason, you’re better off having your listing agent cut his take instead of cut-
ting the commission that you pay to a real estate agent who brings a buyer 
for your property to you.
 
In terms of the length of the listing agreement, three months is reasonable. If 
you give an agent too long to list your property (6 to 12 months), the agent 
may simply toss your listing into the multiple listing database and not expend 
much effort to get your property sold. Practically speaking, you can fire your 
agent whenever you want, regardless of the length of the listing agreement, 
but a shorter listing may motivate your agent more.

254
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Selling without a real estate agent
The temptation to sell real estate without an agent is usually to save the com-
mission that an agent deducts from your property’s sale price. If you have 
the time, energy, and marketing experience, you can sell sans agent and 
possibly save some money.
 
The major problem with attempting to sell real estate on your own is that 
you can’t list it in the MLS, which, in most areas, only real estate agents can 
access. If you’re not listed in the MLS, many potential buyers never know that 
your home is for sale. Agents who work with buyers don’t generally look for 
or show their clients properties that are for sale by owner or listed with 
discount brokers.
Besides saving you time, a good agent can help ensure that you’re not sued 
for failing to disclose known defects of your property. If you decide to sell on 
your own, have access to a legal advisor who can review the contracts. Take 
the time to educate yourself about the many facets of selling property for top 
dollar — read House Selling For Dummies, which I coauthored with Ray 
Brown (published by Wiley).

you also find out how to buy an existing business.

any people dream about running their own companies, and for good 
reason. If you start your own business, you can pursue something 
that you’re passionate about, and you have more control over how you do 
things. Plus, successful business owners can reap major economic bounties.
 
But tales of entrepreneurs becoming multimillionaires focus attention on the 
financial rewards without revealing the business and personal challenges and 
costs associated with being in charge. Consider what your company has to do 
well to survive and succeed in the competitive business world:
 
 Develop products and services that customers will purchase.
 
 Price your offerings properly and promote them.
 
 Deal with the competition.
 
 Manage the accounting.
 
 Interpret lease contracts and evaluate office space.
 
 Keep current with changes in your field.
 
 Hire, train, and retain good employees.
Business owners also face personal and emotional challenges, which rarely 
get airtime among all the glory of the rags-to-riches tales of multimillionaire 
entrepreneurs. Major health problems, divorces, fights and lawsuits among 
family members who are in business together, the loss of friends, and even 
suicides have been attributed to the passions of business owners who are 
consumed with winning or become overwhelmed by their failures.

Had enough already? I’m not trying to scare you, but I do want you to be 
realistic about starting your own business. Maybe you do have the right stuff 
to run your own company, but most people don’t.
Testing Your Entrepreneurial IQ
The keys to success and enjoyment as an entrepreneur vary as much as the 
businesses do. But if you can answer yes to most of the following questions, 
you probably have the qualities and perspective needed to succeed as a 
small-business owner.
 
Don’t be deterred by the questions that you can’t answer in the affirmative. 
A perfect entrepreneur doesn’t exist. Part of succeeding in business is 
knowing what you can’t do, as well as what you can do, and finding creative 
ways (or people) to help you.
 
1. Are you a self-starter? Do you like challenges? Are you persistent? Are 
you willing to do research to solve problems?
 
 Running your own business isn’t glamorous most of the time, especially 
in the early years. You have many details to mind and things to do. 
Success in business is the result of doing lots of little things well. If 
you’re accustomed to working for large organizations where much of the 
day is spent attending meetings and keeping up on office politics and 
gossip, with little accountability, you probably won’t enjoy or succeed at 
running your own business.
 
2. Do you value independence and self-control?
 
 Particularly in the early days of your business, you need to enjoy work-
ing on your own. When you leave a company environment and work on 
your own, you give up a lot of socializing. Of course, if you work in an 
unpleasant environment or with people you don’t really enjoy socializ-
ing with, venturing out on your own may be a plus.
 
 If you’re a people person, many businesses offer lots of contact. But you 
must recognize the difference between socializing with co-workers and 
networking with business contacts and customers.
 
3. Can you develop a commitment to an idea, product, or principle?
 
 Most entrepreneurs work about 50 hours per week, 50 or so weeks a 
year — that’s about 2,500 hours per year. If the product, service, or 
cause that you’re pursuing doesn’t excite you and you can’t motivate 
others to work hard for you, you’re going to have a long year!

259
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
 
 One of the worst reasons to start your own business is for the pursuit of 
great financial riches. Don’t get me wrong — if you’re good at what you 
do and you know how to market your services or products, you may 
make more money working for yourself. But for most people, money 
isn’t enough of a motivation, and many people make the same or less 
money on their own than they did working for a company.
 
4. Are you willing to make financial sacrifices and live a reduced life-
style before and during your early entrepreneurial years?
 
 “Live like a student, before and during the start-up of your small busi-
ness” was the advice that my best business school professor, James 
Collins, gave me before I started my business. With most businesses, 
you expend money during the start-up years and likely have a reduced 
income compared to the income you receive while working for a com-
pany. You also have to buy your own benefits.
 
 To make your entrepreneurial dream a reality, you need to live within 
your means both before and after you start your business. But if running 
your own business really makes you happy, sacrificing expensive vaca-
tions, overpriced luxury cars, the latest designer clothing, and $4 lattes 
at the corner cafe shouldn’t be too painful.
 
5. Do you recognize that when you run your own business, you must still 
report to bosses?
 
 Besides the allure of huge profits, the other reason some people mistak-
enly go into business for themselves is that they’re tired of working for 
other people. Obnoxious, evil bosses can make anyone want to become 
an entrepreneur.
 
 When you run your own business, you may have customers and other 
bosses who are miserable to deal with. Fortunately, even the worst 
customers usually can’t make your life anywhere near as miserable as 
the worst bosses. (If you have enough customers, you can simply decide 
not to do business with such misfits.)
 
6. Can you withstand rejection, naysayers, and negative feedback?
 
 “I thought every no that I got when trying to raise my funding brought 
me one step closer to a yes,” says Alex Popov, an entrepreneur I once 
met. Unless you come from an entrepreneurial family, don’t expect your 
parents to endorse your “risky, crazy” behavior. Even other entrepre-
neurs can ridicule your good ideas. Two of my entrepreneurial friends 
were critical of each other’s idea, yet both have succeeded! Some people 
(especially parents) simply think that working for a giant company 
makes you safer and more secure (which, of course, is a myth, because 
corporations can lay you off in a snap). It’s also easier for them to say to 
their friends and neighbors that you’re a big manager at a well-known 
corporation (such as IBM, GE, Enron, or WorldCom) than to explain that 

260
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
you’re working on some kooky business idea out of a spare bedroom. 
(How secure do you think those former employees of Enron and 
WorldCom feel now about having lost their jobs at their former large 
company?)
 
7. Are you able to identify your shortcomings and hire or align yourself 
with people and organizations that complement your skills and 
expertise?
 
 To be a successful entrepreneur, you need to be a bit of a jack-of-all-
trades: marketer, accountant, customer service representative, adminis-
trative assistant, and so on. Unless you get lots of investor capital, which 
is rare for a true start-up, you can’t afford to hire help in the early 
months, or perhaps even years, of your business.
 
 Partnering with or buying certain services or products rather than 
trying to do everything yourself may make sense for you. And over time, 
if your business grows and succeeds, you should be able to afford to 
hire more help. If you can be honest with yourself and surround and 
partner yourself with people whose skills and expertise complement 
yours, you can build a winning team!
 
8. Do you deal well with ambiguity? Do you believe in yourself?
 
 When you’re on your own, determining when and if you’re on the right 
track is difficult. Some days, things don’t go well — and such days are 
much harder to take flying solo. Therefore, being confident, optimistic, 
and able to work around obstacles are necessary skills.
 
9. Do you understand why you started the business or organization and 
how you personally define “success”?
 
 Many business entrepreneurs define success by such measures as sales 
revenue, profits, number of branch offices and employees, and so on. 
These are fine measures, but other organizations, particularly nonprof-
its, have other measures. For example, the Washington, D.C.–based 
nonpartisan Violence Policy Center (VPC) seeks “to fight firearms 
violence through research, education, and advocacy.”
 
 To accomplish such goals as affecting public policy and public opinion 
about an issue like gun violence, money is necessary, but such a cause-
focused organization has a “bottom line” very different from a for-profit 
organization.
 
10. Can you accept lack of success in the early years of building your 
business?
 
 A few rare businesses are instant hits, but most businesses take time 
to build momentum — it may take years, perhaps even decades. Some 
successful corporate people suffer from anxiety when they go out on 
their own and encounter the inevitable struggles and lack of tangible 
success as they build their companies.

 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
Considering Alternative Routes
Sometimes, entrepreneurial advocates imply that running your own business 
or starting your own nonprofit is the greatest thing in the world and that all 
Myths of being an entrepreneur
Many myths persist about what it takes to be an 
entrepreneur, partly because those who aren’t 
entrepreneurs tend to hang out with others who 
aren’t. The mass media’s popularization of 
“successful” entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates, 
Donald Trump, and Oprah Winfrey leads to 
numerous misperceptions and misconceptions, 
including these often-cited nuggets:
  You have to be well-connected or know 
“important” people. I think that being a 
decent human being is far more important. 
Enough rude, inconsiderate, and self-
centered people are in the business world 
(and, yes, some of them do succeed in spite 
of their character flaws), and if you’re not 
that way, you’ll be able to meet people who 
can help you in one way or another. But 
remember that looking in the mirror shows 
you your best and most trusted resource.
  You need to have an MBA or some other 
fancy degree. Many successful entrepre-
neurs — Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, for 
example — don’t even have college 
degrees, for goodness’ sakes. Perusing 
Forbes magazine’s lists of the most finan-
cially successful small companies shows 
that about 15 percent of the CEOs didn’t 
earn a college degree and about half don’t 
have advanced degrees! These statistics 
are even more amazing when you consider 
that a relatively large number of entrepre-
neurs with humble backgrounds leave or 
are forced out of the successful enterprises 
they started.
 
 I’m not saying that a good education isn’t 
worthwhile in general and that it can’t help 
you succeed in your own business. (For 
example, Ivy Leaguers run about 6 percent 
of the 200 best small businesses, yet Ivy 
League college grads make up less than 1 
percent of all graduates.) But a formal edu-
cation isn’t necessary.
  You need to be a genius. Intelligence is 
admittedly a difficult thing to measure, but 
the majority of entrepreneurs have IQs 
under 120, and a surprising percentage 
have IQs under the average of 100 — more 
entrepreneurs, in fact, have IQs under 100 
than have IQs greater than 130!
  You must be a gregarious, big-egoed extro-
vert. Although some studies show that more 
entrepreneurs are extroverted, many entre-
preneurs are not.
  You have to be willing to take a huge risk. 
Some people focus on the potential for fail-
ure. Consider the worst-case scenario — if 
your venture doesn’t work out, you can 
always go back to a job similar to the one 
you left behind. Also, recognize that risk is 
a matter of perception, and as with invest-
ments, people completely overlook some 
risks. What about the risk to your happiness 
and career if you stay in a boring, claw-
your-way-up-the-corporate-ladder kind of 
job? You always risk a layoff when you work 
for a company. An even greater risk is that 
you’ll wake up in your 50s and 60s and think 
that it’s too late to do something on your 
own and wish you had tried sooner.

262
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
people would be happy owning their own business if they just set their mind 
to it. The reality is that some people won’t be blissful as entrepreneurs. If 
you didn’t score highly on my ten-question entrepreneur assessment in the 
preceding section, don’t despair. You can probably be happier and more 
successful doing something other than starting your own business.
 
Some people are better off working for someone else. Consider the following 
options.
Being an entrepreneur inside a company
A happy medium is available for people who want the challenge of running 
their own show without giving up the comforts and security that come with a 
company environment — for example, you can manage an entrepreneurial 
venture at a company. That’s what John Kilcullen, president and chief execu-
tive officer of IDG Books Worldwide (former publisher of this book), did when 
he helped launch the book publishing division of IDG in 1990. (IDG Books was 
subsequently bought by John Wiley & Sons, Inc., in 2001.)
Kilcullen had publishing industry experience and wanted to take on the 
responsibility of growing a successful publishing company. But he also knew 
that being a player in the book publishing industry takes a lot of money and 
resources. Because he was a member of the founding team of the new IDG 
Books division, Kilcullen had the best of both worlds.
Kilcullen always had a passion to start his own business but found that most 
traditional publishers weren’t interested in giving autonomy and money to a 
division and letting it run with the ball. “I wanted the ability to build a busi-
ness on my own instincts . . . the appeal of IDG was that it was decentralized. 
IDG was willing to invest and provide the freedom to spend as we saw fit.”
If you’re able to secure an entrepreneurial position inside a larger company, 
in addition to significant managerial and operational responsibility, you can 
also negotiate your share of the financial success that you help create. The 
parent company’s senior management wants you to have the incentive that 
comes from sharing in the financial success of your endeavors. Bonuses, 
stock options, and the like are often tied to a division’s performance.
Investing in your career
Some people are happy or content as employees. Companies need and want 
lots of good employees, so you can find a job if you have skills, a work ethic, 
and the ability to get along with others.

263
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
 
You can improve your income-earning ability and invest in your career in a 
variety of different ways:
 
 Work: Be willing to work extra hours and take on more responsibility, 
but do so within reason. Those who take extra initiative and then deliver 
really stand out in a company where many people working on a salary 
have a time-clock, 9-to-5 mentality. But be careful that the extra effort 
doesn’t contribute to workaholism, a dangerous addiction that causes 
too many people to neglect important personal relationships and their 
own health. Don’t bite off more than you can chew — otherwise, your 
supervisors won’t have faith that they can count on you to deliver. Find 
ways to work smarter, not just longer, hours.
 
 Read: One of the reasons that you don’t need a PhD, master’s degree, or 
even an undergraduate college degree to succeed in business is that you 
can find out a lot on your own. You can gain insight by doing, but you 
can also gain expertise by reading a lot. A good bookstore has no 
entrance requirements, such as an elevated high school grade point 
average or high SAT scores — you only have to walk through the doors. 
A good book isn’t free, but it costs a heck of lot less than taking more 
college or graduate courses!
 
 Study: If you haven’t completed your college or graduate degree and the 
industry you’re in values those who have, consider investing the time 
and money to finish your education. Speak with others who have taken 
that path and see what they have to say.
Exploring Small-Business 
Investment Options
Only your imagination limits the ways that you can make money with small 
businesses. Choosing the option that best meets your needs isn’t unlike 
choosing other investments, such as in real estate (see Part III) or in the 
securities markets (see Part II). Following are the major ways you can invest 
in small business and what’s attractive and not about each option.
Starting your own business
Of all your small-business options, starting your own business involves 
the greatest amount of work. Although you can perform this work on a part-
time basis in the beginning, most people end up working in their business 
full time.

264
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
For most of my working years, I’ve run my own business, and overall, I really 
like it. In my experience counseling small-business owners, I’ve seen many 
people of varied backgrounds, interests, and skills achieve success and 
happiness running their own businesses.
Don’t start a business for tax write-offs
“Start a small business for fun, profit, and huge 
tax deductions,” a financial advice book 
declares, adding that “the tax benefits alone 
are worth starting a small business.” A seminar 
company offers a course titled “How to Have 
Zero Taxes Deducted from Your Paycheck.” 
This tax seminar tells you how to solve your tax 
problems: “If you have a sideline business, or 
would like to start one, you’re eligible to have 
little or no taxes taken from your pay.”
All this sounds too good to be true — and of 
course it is. Not only are the strategies sure to 
lead to IRS-audit purgatory, but such books and 
seminars may also seduce you to pony up $100 
or more for audiotapes or notebooks of “inside 
information.”
Unfortunately, many self-proclaimed self-help 
gurus state that you can slash your taxes simply 
by finding a product or service that you can sell 
on the side of your regular employment. The 
problem, they argue, is that as a regular wage 
earner who receives a paycheck from an 
employer, you can’t write off many of your other 
(personal) expenses. Open a sideline business, 
they say, and you can deduct your personal 
expenses as business expenses.
The pitch is enticing, but the reality is something 
quite different. You have to spend money to get 
tax deductions, and the spending must be for 
legitimate purposes of your business in its 
efforts to generate income. If you think that 
taking tax deductions for your hobby is worth 
the risk because you won’t get caught unless 
you’re audited, the odds are stacked against 
you. The IRS audits an extraordinarily large por-
tion of small businesses that show regular 
losses.
The bottom line is that you need to operate a 
real business for the purpose of generating 
income and profits, not tax deductions. The IRS 
considers an activity a hobby (and not a busi-
ness) if it shows a loss for three or more of the 
preceding five tax years. (Exception: The IRS 
considers horse racing and breeding a hobby if 
it shows a loss for five or more of the preceding 
seven tax years.) Some years, a certain number 
of businesses lose money, but a real business 
can’t afford to do so year after year and remain 
in operation. Even if your sideline business 
passes this hobby test, as well as other IRS 
requirements, deducting any expenses that 
aren’t directly applicable to your business is 
illegal.
If these hobby-loss rules indicate that you’re 
engaging in a hobby but you still want to claim 
your losses, you must convince the IRS that 
you’re seriously trying to make a profit and run 
a legitimate business. The IRS wants to see that 
you’re actively marketing your services, build-
ing your skills, and accounting for income and 
expenses. The IRS also wants to see that you 
don’t derive too much pleasure from an activity. 
If you do, the IRS says that what you’re doing 
is a hobby and not a business. Business isn’t 
supposed to give you too much enjoyment!

265
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
 
Most people perceive starting their own business as the riskiest of all small-
business investment options. But if you get into a business that uses your 
skills and expertise, the risk isn’t nearly as great as you may think. Suppose 
that you teach and make $35,000 per year and you want to set up your own 
tutoring service, making a comparable amount of money. If you find through 
your research that others who perform these services charge $40 per hour, 
you need to actually tutor about 20 or so hours per week, assuming that you 
work 50 weeks per year. Because you can run this business from your home 
(which can possibly generate small tax breaks) without purchasing new 
equipment, your expenses should be minimal.
Instead of leaving your job cold turkey and trying to build your business from 
scratch, you can start moonlighting as a tutor. Over a couple of years, if you 
can build the tutoring up to ten hours per week, you’re halfway to your goal. 
If you leave your job and focus all your energies on your tutoring business, 
getting to 20 hours per week of billable work shouldn’t be a problem. Still 
think starting a business is risky?
 
Many businesses can be started with little money by leveraging your existing 
skills and expertise. If you have the time to devote to building “sweat equity,” 
you can build a valuable company and job. As long as you check out the com-
petition and offer a valued product or service at a reasonable cost, the princi-
pal risk with your business is that you won’t do a good job marketing what 
you have to offer. If you can market your skills, you should succeed. See 
Chapter 14 for more details on starting and running your own business.
Buying an existing business
If you don’t have a specific idea for a business that you want to start but you 
have business management skills and an ability to improve existing busi-
nesses, consider buying an established business. Although you don’t have to 
go through the riskier start-up period if you take this route, you’ll likely need 
more capital to buy a going enterprise.
You also need to be able to deal with potentially sticky personnel and man-
agement issues. The history of the organization and the way things work 
predates your ownership of the business. If you don’t like making hard deci-
sions, firing people who don’t fit with your plans, and coercing people into 
changing the way they did things before you arrived on the scene, buying an 
existing business likely isn’t for you. Also realize that some of the good 
employees may be loyal to the old owner and his style of running the busi-
ness, so they may split when you arrive.
 
Some people perceive that buying an existing business is safer than starting a 
new one, but buying someone else’s business can actually be riskier. You’ll 
have to shell out far more money upfront, in the form of a down payment, to 
buy a business. If you don’t have the ability to run the business and it does 

266
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
poorly, you may lose much more financially. Another risk is that the business 
may be for sale for a reason — perhaps it’s not very profitable, it’s in decline, 
or it’s generally a pain in the posterior to operate.
Good businesses that are for sale don’t come cheaply. If the business is a 
success, the current owner has removed the start-up risk from the business, 
so the price of the business should include a premium to reflect this lack of 
risk. If you have the capital to buy an established business and you have the 
skills to run it, consider going this route. Chapter 15 discusses how to buy a 
good business.
Investing in someone else’s business
If you like the idea of profiting from successful small businesses but don’t 
want the day-to-day headaches of being responsible for managing the enter-
prise, you may want to invest in someone else’s small business. Although this 
route may seem easier, fewer people are actually cut out to be investors in 
other people’s businesses.
Investing for the right reasons
 
Consider investing in someone else’s business if you meet the following 
criteria:
 
 You have sufficient assets so that what you invest in small privately held 
companies is a small portion (20 percent or less) of your total financial 
assets.
 
 You can afford to lose what you invest. Unlike investing in a diversified 
stock mutual fund (see Chapter 8), you may lose all of your investment 
when you invest in a small, privately held company.
 
 You’re astute at evaluating financial statements and business strategies. 
Investing in a small, privately held company has much in common with 
investing in a publicly traded firm. The difference is that private firms 
aren’t required to produce comprehensive, audited financial statements 
that adhere to certain accounting principles the way that public compa-
nies are. Thus, you have a greater risk of not receiving sufficient or 
accurate information when you evaluate a small private firm.
Putting money into your own business (or someone else’s) can be a 
high-risk — but potentially high-return — investment. The best options are 
those that you understand well. If you hear about a great business idea or 
company from someone you know and trust, do your research and make 
your best judgment. That company or idea may well be a terrific investment.

267
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
 
Before you invest, ask to see a copy of the business plan and compare it with 
the business plan model that I suggest later in this chapter. Thoroughly check 
out the people running the business. Talk to others who don’t have a stake in 
the investment and benefit from their comments and concerns. But don’t 
forget that many a wise person has rained on the parade of what turned out to 
be a terrific business idea.
Avoiding investing mistakes
 
Although some people are extra careful when they invest other people’s 
money, know that many small-business owners seek investors’ money for 
the wrong reasons. Some business owners are impatient and perhaps don’t 
understand the feasibility of making do with a small amount of capital (a pro-
cess called bootstrapping, which I discuss in Chapter 14).
Other businesses need money because they’re in financial trouble. One 
small furniture retailer in my area conducted a stock offering to raise money. 
On the surface, everything seemed fine, and the company made it onto the 
Inc. 500 list of fast-growing small companies. But it turns out that the com-
pany wanted to issue stock because it expanded too quickly and didn’t sell 
enough merchandise to cover its high overhead. The company ended up in 
bankruptcy.
Another problem with small businesses that seek investors is that many 
small-business owners may take more risk and do less upfront planning and 
homework with other people’s money. Many well-intentioned people fail at 
their businesses. An MBA whom I know from a top business school — I’ll call 
him Jacob — convinced an investor to put up about $300,000 to purchase a 
small manufacturing company. Jacob put a small amount of his own money 
into the business and immediately blew about $100,000 on a fancy computer 
scheduling and order-entry system.
Likewise, Jacob wasn’t interested much in sales (a job that the previous 
owner managed), so he hired a sales manager. The sales manager he hired 
was a disaster — many of the front-line salespeople fled to competitors, 
taking key customers with them. By the time Jacob came to his senses, it 
was too late — the disaster had unfolded. He tried to cut costs, but doing so 
hurt the quality and timeliness of the company’s products. The business 
dissolved, and the investor lost everything.
Drawing Up Your Business Plan
If you’re motivated to start your own business, the next step is to figure out 
what you want to do and how you’re going to do it; in other words, you need 
a business plan. You need a general plan that helps you define what you think 

268
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
you want to do and the tasks that you need to perform to accomplish your 
goal. The business plan, which is for your own planning, to obtain loans, and 
to show potential investors, should be a working document or blueprint for 
the early days, months, and years of your business.
You don’t need a perfectly detailed plan that spells out all the minutiae. 
Making such an involved plan is a waste of your time because things change 
and evolve.
The amount of detail that your plan needs depends on your goals and the 
specifics of your business. A simple, more short-term focused plan (ten pages 
or so) is fine if you don’t aspire to build an empire. However, if your goal is to 
grow, hire employees, and open multiple locations, then your plan needs to 
be longer (20 to 50 pages) to cover longer-term issues. If you want outside 
investor money, a longer business plan is a necessity.
 
As you put together your plan and evaluate your opportunities, open your 
ears and eyes. Expect to do research and to speak with other entrepreneurs 
and people in the industry. Most people will spend time talking with you as 
long as they realize that you don’t want to compete with them. And for more 
details on crafting a business plan, check out my book Small Business For 
Dummies, written with Jim Schell and published by Wiley.
Identifying your business concept
What do you want your business to do? What product or service do you want 
to offer? Maybe your business goal is to perform tax-preparation services for 
small-business owners. Or perhaps you want to start a consulting firm, open 
a restaurant that sells healthy fast food, run a gardening service, or manufac-
ture toys.
 
Your concept doesn’t need to be unique to survive in the business world — 
witness the legions of self-employed consultants, plumbers, tax preparers, and 
restaurant owners. The existence of many other people who already do what 
you want to do validates the potential for your small-business ideas. I know 
many wage slaves who say they would love to run their own business if they 
could only come up with “the idea.” Most of these people still dream about 
their small-business plans as they draw their Social Security checks. Being 
committed to the idea of running your own business is more important than 
developing the next great product or service. In the beginning, the business 
opportunities that you pursue can be quite general to your field of expertise 
or interest. What you eventually do over time will evolve.
I’m not saying that an innovative idea lacks merit. A creative idea gives you 
the chance to hit a big home run, and the first person to successfully develop 
a new idea can achieve big success.

269
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
 
Even if you aspire to build the next billion-dollar company, you can put a twist 
on older concepts. Suppose that you’re a veterinarian, but you don’t want a 
traditional office where people must bring their cats and dogs for treatment. 
You believe that because many people are starved for free time, they want a 
vet who makes house calls. Thus, you open your Vet on Wheels business. 
You may also want to franchise the business and open locations around the 
country. However, you can also succeed by doing what thousands of other 
vets are now doing and have done over the years with a traditional office.

Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Outlining your objectives
The reasons for starting and running your own small business are as varied 
as the entrepreneurs behind their companies. Before you start your firm, it’s 
useful to think about what you’re seeking to achieve. Your objectives need 
not be cast in concrete and will surely change over time. If you like, you can 
write a short and motivating mission statement.
When you ask an MBA, especially one from a big-name school, to think about 
objectives, she usually says something like, “My goal is to run a $20 million 
company in seven years.” Financial objectives are fine, but don’t make your 
objectives strictly financial unless money is the only reason that you want to 
run your own business.
Introductory economics courses teach students that the objective of every 
for-profit firm is to maximize profits. As with many things taught in econom-
ics courses, this theory has one problem — it doesn’t hold up in reality. Most 
small-business owners I know don’t manage their businesses maniacally in 
the pursuit of maximum profits. The following list gives you some other pos-
sible objectives to consider:
 
 Working with people you like and respect: Some customers may buy 
your products and services, and some employees and suppliers may 
offer you their services for a good price, but what if you can’t stand 
working with them? If you have sufficient business or just have your own 
standards, you can choose whom you do business with.
 
 Educating others: Maybe part of your business goal is to educate the 
public about something that you’re an expert in. I know that when I 
started my financial counseling and writing business, I saw education as 
a core part of my company’s purpose.
 
 Improving an industry/setting a higher standard: Perhaps part of your 
goal in starting your business is to show how your industry can better 
serve its customers. John Bogle, who founded the Vanguard Group of 
mutual funds, is a good example of someone who wanted to improve 
an industry. When he started Vanguard more than three decades ago, 
Bogle structured the company so the shareholders (customers) of the 
company’s individual mutual funds would own the company.
 
 Because he relinquished ownership of his company, Bogle gave up the 
opportunity to build a personal net worth that would easily be worth 
several billion dollars today. But Bogle wanted to build a mutual fund 
company that kept operating costs to a minimum and returned profits to 
the customers in the form of lower operating fees, which are deducted 
from a mutual fund’s returns. He’s also been outspoken about how 
owners of many mutual fund companies operate their funds too much 
out of self-interest instead of keeping their customers in mind.

271
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
Of course, you can’t accomplish these objectives without profits, and doing 
these things isn’t inconsistent with generating greater profits. But if your 
objectives are more than financial or your financial objectives aren’t your 
number-one concern, don’t worry — that’s usually a good sign. Remember 
the expression, “Do what you love, the money will follow.”
Analyzing the marketplace
 
The single most important area to understand is the marketplace in which 
your business competes. To be successful, your business must not only pro-
duce a good product or service, but it must also reach customers and con-
vince them to buy your product at a price at which you can make a profit. You 
should discern what the competition has to offer, as well as its strengths and 
vulnerabilities. In most industries, you also need to understand government 
regulations that affect the type of business that you’re considering.
Meeting customer needs
If the market analysis is the most important part of the business plan, then 
understanding your potential customers is the most important part of your 
market analysis. If you don’t understand your desired customers and their 
needs, don’t expect to have a successful business.
If you’re in a business that sells to consumers, consider your customers’ 
gender, age, income, geographic location, marital status, number of children, 
education, living situation (rent or own), and the reasons they want your 
product or service. Who are your prospective customers? Where do they 
live, and what do they care about? If you sell to businesses, you need to 
understand similar issues. What types of businesses may buy your product 
or services? Why?
 
The best way to get to know your potential customers is to get out and talk to 
them. While more time consuming, live interviews allow you to go with the 
flow of the conversation, improvise questions, and probe more interesting 
areas. Although you can mail or fax paper-based surveys to many people with 
a minimal investment of your time, the response rate is usually quite low, and 
the answers are usually not as illuminating. To encourage better response, 
offer a product or service sample or some other promotional item to those 
who help you with your research. Doing so attracts people who are interested 
in your product or service, which helps you define your target customers.
Also, try to get a sense of what customers do pay and will pay for the prod-
ucts or services that you offer. Analyzing the competition’s offerings helps, 
too. Some products or services also require follow-up or additional servicing. 
Understand what customers need and what they’ll pay for your services.

272
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
 
If you want to raise money from investors, include some estimates as to the 
size of the market for your product or services. Of course, such numbers are 
ballpark estimates, but sizing the market for your product helps you estimate 
profitability, the share of the market needed to be profitable, and so on.
Besting the competition
Always examine the products, services, benefits, and prices that competitors 
offer. Otherwise, you go on blind faith that what you offer stacks up well 
versus the alternatives in the industry.
You first need to decide whether you have a realistic chance of winning the 
consumer choice battle. I think you’ll agree that going into the same discount 
warehouse retailing business and competing head-to-head with Wal-Mart, 
Costco, or Home Depot is crazy.
 
Examine your competitors’ weaknesses so you can exploit them. Rather than 
trying to beat them on their terms, maybe you’ve identified a need for a neigh-
borhood pet supply store that offers a more specialized range of pet supplies 
than the big-selling brands of dog and cat food that warehouse stores sell. 
Providing knowledgeable customer sales representatives to answer customer 
questions and make product suggestions can also give you a competitive 
edge. Thus, you may be able to surpass the warehouse stores on three counts: 
convenience of location for people in your neighborhood, breadth of product 
offerings, and customer assistance.
 
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that even if you have a completely 
innovative product or service that no other business currently offers, you 
don’t have competitors. All businesses have competitors. In the event that 
you’ve developed something truly unique that has little competition, your 
success will surely breed competition as imitators follow or attempt to 
leapfrog your lead.
Complying with regulations
Most businesses are subject to some sort of regulation. If you want to start a 
retail business, for example, few communities permit you to run it out of your 
home. If you lease or purchase a private location, the zoning laws in that 
location may restrict you. Therefore, you need to check what you can and 
can’t sell at that location. Check with the zoning department of your city or 
town — don’t simply believe a real estate broker or property owner who 
says, “No problem!” That person’s goal, after all, is to sell the property.
If you were going to start a veterinary practice, you would quickly discover 
that special zoning is required to use a piece of real estate for a vet’s office. 
Convincing a local zoning board to allow a new location to get such special 
zoning is quite difficult, if not impossible, in some areas.

273
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
Many businesses face other local, state, and even federal regulatory issues, 
including ordinances, laws, and the need for specific licenses and filings. For 
example, if you were opening a restaurant, you’d have to heed ordinances 
and laws that regulate everything from signage to operating hours to your 
ability to serve alcohol. And you’d be subject to an amazing array of health 
codes, building codes, and fire codes, to name a few.
 
If you enter an industry that you’re relatively new to, ask questions and open 
your ears to find out more about where you should locate and how you should 
design your business. Speak to people who are currently in the field and your 
local chamber of commerce to see what, if any, licenses or filings you must 
complete. Read books on the subject and check the newsstand and local 
library for trade magazines that may deal with your questions. Libraries have 
books and online services that can help you locate specific articles on topics 
that interest you.
Delivering your service or product
Every business has a product or service to sell. How are you going to provide 
this product or service? Suppose that you want to start a business that deliv-
ers groceries and runs errands for busy people or older and disabled people 
who can’t easily perform daily tasks for themselves. Delineate the steps 
that you’ll take to provide the service. When potential customers call you to 
inquire about your business, what kinds of information do you want to 
record about their situation? Create a pricing sheet and other marketing 
literature (discussed in the next section) that you can mail curious potential 
customers. After someone calls and says, “I want to hire you,” you need to 
collect more details. Try drawing up an information sheet that prompts you 
for the information that you need (for example, address, promised delivery 
time, desired items, and so on).
If you want to be a tax preparer, you need forms or a filing system to give to 
your customers to help them organize the information that they give to you.
 
The point of these examples is that you need to map out a system that you 
can work with before you dive into running your business. Your system may 
evolve over time — you can be guaranteed of that — but a tentative game plan 
has great value.
If you want to manufacture a product, you definitely need to scope out the 
process that you’re going to use. Otherwise, you have no idea how much 
time the manufacturing process may take or what the process may cost.
As your business grows and you hire employees to provide services or 
create your products, the more you codify what you do, and the better your 
employees can replicate your good work.

Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Marketing your service or product
After you get more in-depth information about your company’s services or 
products, you need to find more specific information about the following:
 
 How much will you charge for your services and products? Look at 
what competing products and services cost. Estimating your costs helps 
you figure out what you need to charge to cover your costs and make a 
reasonable profit.
 
 How will you position your product and services versus the competi-
tion? Remember the local pet supply store example that I mention in 
the earlier section “Besting the competition”? It positions itself as a 
convenient store equipped with a broad selection and knowledgeable 
customer assistance. Books similarly position themselves in the 
book marketplace. I hope, in your mind, that my financial books are 
down-to-earth, practical, answer-oriented, and educational.
 
 Where will you sell your product or service? Business consultants 
label this decision the distribution channel question. For example, if 
you’re going to go into the hula hoop manufacturing business, you may 
consider selling via mail order and the Internet, through toy stores, or 
through discount warehouse stores. Selling through each of these differ-
ent distribution channels requires unique marketing and advertising 
programs. If you market a product or service to companies, you need to 
find out who the key decision makers are at the company and what will 
persuade them to buy your product or service.
Having a great product or service isn’t enough if you keep it a secret — you 
gotta get the word out. It’s doubtful that you have the budget or want to 
reach the same region that television and radio reach.
 
Start marketing your product to people you know. Develop a punchy, informa-
tive one-page letter that announces your company’s inception and the prod-
ucts or services it offers, and mail it to your contacts. Include an envelope 
with a reply form that allows recipients to provide the addresses of others 
who may be interested in what you have to offer. Send these folks a mailing as 
well, referencing who passed their names along to you.
Finding and retaining customers is vital to any business that wants to 
grow and be profitable. One simple, inexpensive way to stay in touch with 
customers you’ve dealt with or others who have made inquiries and 
expressed interest in your company’s offerings is via a mailing list. Once 
a quarter, once a year, or whatever makes sense for your business, send out 
a simple, professional-looking postcard or newsletter announcing new infor-
mation about your business and what customer needs you can fulfill. Such 

275
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
mailings also allow you to remind people that you’re still in business and that 
you provide a wonderful product or service. Computer software gives you 
a fast, efficient way to keep a customer mailing list up to date and to print 
mailing labels.
 
E-mailing this information has the attraction of no out-of-pocket expenses. 
However, due to the deluge of junk e-mail most people get, your e-mail is likely 
to be deleted without being opened. At least a snail-mailed postcard will get 
prospective customers’ attention, even if only for a brief period.
Organizing and staffing your business
Many small businesses are one-person operations. So much the better for 
you — you have none of the headaches of hiring, payroll, and so on. You only 
have to worry about you — and that may be a handful in itself!
But if you would rather manage the work being done instead of doing all the 
work yourself, and if you hope to grow your business, you’ll eventually want 
to hire people. (I explain the best way to fill your personnel needs in Chapter 
14.) Give some thought now to the skills and functional areas of expertise 
that future hires need. If you want to raise money, the employment section of 
your business plan is essential to show your investors that you’re planning 
long-term.
Maybe you’ll want an administrative assistant, researcher, marketing person, 
or sales representative. What about a training specialist, finance person, or 
real estate person if your company expands? Consider the background that 
you want in those you hire, and look at the types of people that similar 
companies select and hire.
You should also consider what legal form of organization — for example, a 
sole proprietorship, partnership, S corporation, limited liability company, 
and so on — your business will adopt. I address this topic in Chapter 14.
Projecting finances
 
An idea often becomes a bad idea or a business failure if you neglect to 
consider, or are unrealistic about, the financial side of the business that you 
want to start. If you’re a creative or people-person type who hates numbers, 
the financial side may be the part of the business plan that you most want to 
avoid. Don’t — doing so can cost you tens of thousands of dollars in avoidable 
mistakes. Ignoring the financial side can even lead to the bankruptcy of a 
business founded with a good idea.

276
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Before you launch your business, you should do enough research so you 
can come up with some decent financial estimates to address these issues. 
Financial projections are mandatory, and knowledgeable investors will 
scrutinize them if you seek outside money. You also need to think through 
how and when investors can cash out.
Start-up and development costs
Spending money to get your business from the idea stage to an operating 
enterprise is inevitable. Before the revenue begins to flow in, you’ll incur 
expenditures as you develop and market your products and services. 
Therefore, you need to understand what you must spend money on and the 
approximate timing of the needed purchases.
If you were going to build a house, you would develop a list of all the required 
costs. How much are the land, construction, carpeting, landscaping, and so 
on going to cost? You can try to develop all these cost estimates yourself, or 
you can speak with local builders and have them help you. Likewise, with 
your business, you can hire a business consultant who knows something 
about your type of business. However, I think you’re best served by doing 
the homework yourself — you discover a lot more, and it’s cheaper.
If you’re going to work in an office setting, at home or in outside space, you 
need furniture (such as a desk, chair, filing cabinets, and so on), a computer, 
printer, and other office supplies. Don’t forget to factor in the costs of any 
licenses or government registrations that you may need.
If you run a retailing operation, you need to also estimate your cost for 
establishing an initial inventory of goods. Remember, selling your inventory 
takes time, especially when you first start up. And as a new business, 
suppliers won’t give you months on end to pay for your initial inventory. 
Be realistic — otherwise, the money that you tie up in inventory can send 
you to financial ruin.
Income statement
Preparing an estimated income statement that summarizes your expected 
revenue and expenses is a challenging and important part of your business 
plan. (I explain the elements of an income statement in Chapter 6.) Preparing 
an income statement is difficult because of all the estimates and assumptions 
that go into it. As you prepare your estimated income statement, you may 
discover that making a decent profit is tougher than you thought. This 
section of your business plan helps you make pricing decisions.
Consider the Vet on Wheels business idea that I discuss in the “Identifying 
your business concept” section, earlier in this chapter. What range of veteri-
nary services can you provide if you make house calls? You can’t perform all 

277
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
the services that you can in a larger office setting. What equipment do you 
need to perform the services? How much should you charge for the services? 
You need to estimate all these things to develop a worthwhile income state-
ment. You should be able to answer these questions from the insights and 
information you pulled together regarding what customers want and what 
your competitors are offering.
 
With service businesses in which you or your employees sell your time, be 
realistic about how many hours you can bill. You may end up being able to bill 
only a third to half of your time, given the other management activities that 
you need to perform.
Because building a customer base takes several years, try to prepare 
estimated income statements for the first three years. In the earlier years, 
you have more start-up costs. In later years, you reap more profits as your 
customer rolls expand. Doing income statements over several years is also 
essential if you’re seeking investor money.
Balance sheet
An income statement measures the profitability of a business over a span of 
time, such as a year, but it tells you nothing of a business’s resources and 
obligations. That’s what a balance sheet does. Just as your personal balance 
sheet itemizes your personal assets (for example, investments) and liabilities 
(debts you owe), a business balance sheet details a company’s assets and 
liabilities.
If you operate a cash business — you provide a service and are paid for that 
service, and you don’t hold any inventory, for example — a balance sheet has 
limited use. An exception is if you’re trying to get a bank loan for your service 
business.
 
A detailed balance sheet isn’t as important as tracking your available cash, 
which will be under pressure in the early years of a business because 
expenses can continue to exceed revenue for quite some time.
A complete balance sheet is useful for a business that owns significant 
equipment, furniture, inventory, and so on. The asset side of the balance 
sheet provides insight into the financial staying power of the company. For 
example, how much cash does your business have on hand to meet expected 
short-term bills? Conversely, the liability side of the ledger indicates the 
obligations, bills, and debts the company has coming due in the short and 
long term.
See Chapter 6 for more information on all the elements of a balance sheet.

Writing an executive summary
 
An executive summary is a two- to three-page summary of your entire 
business plan that you can share with interested investors who may not 
want to first wade through a 40- to 50-page plan. The executive summary 
whets the prospective investor’s appetite by touching on the highlights of 
your entire plan. Although this summary should go in the front of your plan 
document, I list this element last because you’re not going to be able to 
write an intelligent summary of your plan until you flesh out the body of your 
business plan.

A
fter you research and evaluate the needs of your business, at some 
point you need to decide whether to actually start your business. In 
reference to his business plan, Alex Popov, founder of Smart Alec’s, a healthy 
fast-food restaurant, says, “Something just clicked one day, and I said to 
myself, ‘Yes, this is a business that is viable and appropriate now.’”
Most entrepreneurs experience this sudden realization, including me — I’ve 
experienced it with every business that I’ve ever started. If you really want to, 
you can conduct and analyze market research and crunch numbers until the 
cows come home. Even if you’re a linear, logical, analytic, quantitative kind of 
person, you need to make a gut-level decision in the final analysis: Do you 
want to jump in the water and start swimming, or do you want to stay on the 
sidelines and remain a spectator? In my opinion, watching isn’t nearly as fun 
as doing. If you feel ready but have some trepidation, you’re normal — just 
go for it!
Starting Up: Your Preflight Check List
When you decide to take off into the world of small-business ownership, you 
also need to ponder and make some decisions about a number of important 
issues. Just like a pilot before he launches an airplane into flight, you need to 

280
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
make sure that all systems are in order and ready to do the job. If your fuel 
tanks aren’t adequately filled, your engines clean and in working order, and 
your wing flaps in the proper position, you may never get your business off 
the ground.
Preparing to leave your job
 
The top reasons that wannabe entrepreneurs remain wannabe entrepreneurs 
are the psychological and financial aspects. Financial and emotional issues 
cause many aspiring entrepreneurs to remain their employers’ indentured 
servants and cause those who do break free to soon return to their bondage. 
You may never discover that you have the talent to run your own business, 
and perhaps have a good idea to boot, unless you prepare yourself financially 
and psychologically to leave your job.
The money side of this self-exploration is easier to deal with than your mind, 
so I’ll start with that. Dealing with a net reduction in the income that you 
bring home from work — at least in the early years of your business — is a 
foregone conclusion for the vast majority of small-business opportunities 
that you may pursue. Accept this fact and plan accordingly.
 
Do all you can to reduce your expenses to a level that fits the entrepreneurial 
life that you want to lead. You must examine your monthly spending patterns 
now to make your budget lean, mean, and entrepreneurially friendly. 
Determine what you spend each month on your rent (or mortgage), groceries, 
eating out, telephone calls, insurance, and so on. Unless you’re one of those 
organized computer geeks — someone who keeps all this data detailed in a 
software package — you need to whip out your checkbook register, ATM 
receipts, credit card statements, and anything else that documents your 
spending habits. Don’t forget to estimate your cash purchases that don’t leave 
a trail, like when you eat lunch out or spend $35 on gas.
Don’t tell me that everything you spend your money on is a necessity and 
that you can’t cut anywhere. Question your expenditures! If you don’t, con-
tinuing to work as an employee will be a necessity, and you’ll never be able to 
pursue your entrepreneurial dream.
Beyond the bare essentials of food, shelter, healthcare, and clothing, most 
of what you spend money on is discretionary — that is, you spend money on 
luxuries. Even the amount that you spend on the necessities, such as food 
and shelter, is probably only part necessity and may include a fair amount of 
luxury and waste. If you need a helping hand and an analyst’s eye in prepar-
ing and developing strategies for reducing your spending, pick up a copy 
of the latest edition of my book Personal Finance For Dummies (published 
by Wiley).

281
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
 
If reducing your spending is the most important financial move you can make 
before and during the period that you start your business, the second-best 
thing you can do is to figure how you’ll manage the income side of your 
personal finances. The following list gives you some proven strategies to 
ensure that you earn enough income to live on:
 
 Transition gradually. One way to pursue your entrepreneurial dreams 
(and not starve while doing so) is to continue working part time in a 
regular job while you work part time at your own business. If you 
have a job that allows you to work part time, seize the opportunity. 
Some employers may even allow you to maintain your benefits.
 
 In addition to ensuring a steady source of income, splitting your time 
allows you to adjust to a new way of making a living. Some people have a 
hard time adjusting to their new lifestyle if they quit their jobs cold 
turkey and plunge headfirst into full-time entrepreneurship.
 
 Another option is to completely leave your job but line up a chunk of 
work that provides a decent income for at least some of your weekly 
work hours. Consulting for your old employer is a time-tested first 
“entrepreneurial” option with low risk.
 
 Get/stay married. Actually, as long as you’re attached to someone who 
maintains a regular job and you manage your spending so you can live 
on that person’s income alone, you’re golden! Just make sure that you 
talk things through with the love of your life to minimize misunderstand-
ings and resentments. Maybe someday you can return the favor — that’s 
what my wife and I did. She was working in education (no big bucks 
there!) when I started an entrepreneurial venture after business school. 
We lived a Spartan lifestyle and made do just fine on her income. Several 
years later, when things were going swimmingly for me, she left her job 
to work on her own business.
Valuing and replacing your benefits
Part of the money dilemmas that you may encounter deal with the benefits 
that your employer provides. For many people, walking away from these 
benefits is both financially and emotionally challenging. Benefits are valuable, 
but you may be surprised by how efficiently you can replicate them in your 
own business.
Health insurance
Some prospective entrepreneurs fret over finding new health insurance. 
Unless you have a significant existing medical problem (known as a 
pre-existing condition), getting health insurance as an individual isn’t difficult.

282
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
The first option to explore is whether your existing coverage through your 
employer’s group plan can be converted into individual coverage. Just don’t 
act on this potentially attractive option until you’ve explored other health 
plans on your own, which may offer similar benefits at lower cost. Also, get 
proposals for individual coverage from major health plans in your area.
 
Take a high deductible, if available, to keep costs down. Having a high-
deductible health plan (which is defined as an individual plan with a deduct-
ible of at least $1,100 or a family plan with a minimum $2,200 deductible for 
tax year 2008 — this amount increases over time with inflation) qualifies 
you to contribute money into a Health Savings Account (HSA). The contribu-
tion limits are up to $2,900 for individuals and $5,800 for families for tax year 
2008, and these amounts increase over time with inflation. Contributions to an 
HSA reduce your current year’s taxable income, and the money compounds 
without taxation over time. Withdrawals aren’t taxed so long as you use the 
money for qualified healthcare expenses, which are fairly broadly defined and 
include traditional out-of-pocket medical expenses (doctors and hospital 
care), as well as dental care, prescription drugs, psychologist expenses, vision 
care, vitamins, and so on.
 
Government regulations called COBRA require an employer with 20 or more 
employees to continue your health insurance coverage (at your own expense) 
for up to 18 months after you terminate employment. Moreover, if you have or 
develop a health problem while covered under COBRA, the law enables you to 
purchase an individual policy at the same price that a healthy individual can. 
These laws create a nice buffer zone for the budding entrepreneur, but don’t 
get lazy and wait until the last minute of the 18th month to start shopping 
for your individual plan — COBRA plans can be costly. Shopping around and 
locking in an individual plan as soon as possible can save money and prevent 
headaches.
Long-term disability insurance
For most people, their greatest asset is their ability to earn money. If you 
suffer a disability and can’t work, how would you manage financially? Long-
term disability insurance protects your income in the event of a disability.
 
Before you leave your job, secure an individual long-term disability policy. 
After you leave your job and are no longer earning steady income, you won’t 
qualify for a policy. Most insurers want to see at least six months of self-
employment income before they’ll write you a policy. If you become disabled 
during this time, you’re uninsured and out of luck — that’s a big risk to take!
 
Check with any professional associations that you belong to or could join to 
see whether they offer long-term disability plans. As with many employer-
based programs, association plans are sometimes less expensive because of 
the group’s purchasing power.

283
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
Life insurance
If you have dependents who count on your income, you need life insurance. 
And unlike with disability insurance, in the vast majority of cases, you can 
purchase a life insurance policy at a lower cost than you can purchase addi-
tional coverage through your employer.
Retirement plans
If your employer offers retirement savings programs, such as a 401(k) plan or 
a pension plan, don’t despair about not having these in the future. (Of course, 
what you’ve already earned and accumulated while employed is yours.) 
One of the best benefits of self-employment is retirement savings plans — 
SEP-IRAs (Simplified Employee Pension Individual Retirement Accounts) and 
Keoghs — that allow you to sock away a hefty chunk of your earnings on a 
tax-deductible basis.
Retirement plans are a terrific way for you and your employees to shield a 
large portion of earnings from taxation. If you don’t have employees, regu-
larly contributing to one of these plans is usually a no-brainer. With employ-
ees, the decision is a bit more complicated but often still a great idea. Small 
businesses with a number of employees can also consider 401(k) plans. I 
explain retirement plans in Chapter 3.
Other benefits
Yes, employers offer other benefits that you may value. For example, you 
seem to get paid holidays and vacations. In reality, though, your employer 
simply spreads your salary over all 52 weeks of a year, thus paying you 
for actually working the other 47 weeks or so out of the year. You can do 
the same by building the cost of this paid time off into your product and 
service pricing.
Another “benefit” of working for an employer is that the employer pays for 
half (7.65 percent) of your Social Security and Medicare taxes. Although you 
must pay the entire tax (15.3 percent) when you’re self-employed, the IRS 
allows you to take half of this amount as a tax deduction on your annual tax 
Form 1040, so that tax isn’t as painful as you think. As with vacations and 
holidays, you can build the cost of this tax into your product and service 
pricing. Just think: Your employer could pay you a higher salary if it weren’t 
paying half of these taxes as a benefit.
 
Some employers offer other insurance plans, such as dental or vision care 
plans. Ultimately, these plans cover small out-of-pocket expenditures that 
aren’t worth insuring. Don’t waste your money purchasing such policies when 
you’re self-employed.

284
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Financing Your Business
When you create your business plan (which I explain how to do in Chapter 
13), you should estimate your start-up and development costs. You can start 
many worthwhile small businesses with little capital. The following sections 
explain methods for financing your business.
Bootstrapping
Making do with a small amount of capital and spending it as you can afford to 
is known as bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is just a fancy way of saying that a 
business lives within its means. This forces a business to be more resource-
ful and less wasteful. Bootstrapping is also a great training mechanism for 
producing cost-effective products and services. It offers you the advantage of 
getting into business in the first place with little capital.
Millions of successful small companies were bootstrapped at one time or 
another. Like small redwood saplings that grow into towering trees, small 
companies that had to bootstrap in the past can eventually grow into hun-
dred million- and even multibillion-dollar companies. For example, Ross Perot 
started EDS with a mere $1,000, and Hewlett-Packard’s founders started their 
company out of a garage in Palo Alto, California. Microsoft, Motorola, Sony, 
and Disney were all bootstrapped, too.
Whether you want to maintain a small shop that employs just yourself, 
hire a few employees, or dream about building the next large company, you 
need capital. However, misconceptions abound about how much money a 
company needs to achieve its goals and sources of funding.
“There’s an illusion that most companies need tons of money to get estab-
lished and grow,” says James Collins, former lecturer at the Stanford 
Graduate School of Business and coauthor of the best-sellers Built to Last and 
Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap . . . and Others Don’t. “The 
Silicon Valley success stories of companies that raise gobs of venture capital 
and grow 4,000 percent are very rare. They are statistically insignificant but 
catch all sorts of attention,” he adds.
Studies show that the vast majority of small businesses obtain their initial 
capital from personal savings and family and friends rather than outside 
sources, such as banks and venture capital firms. A Harvard Business School 
study of the Inc. 500 (500 large, fast-growing private companies) found that 
more than 80 percent of the successful companies were started with funds 
from the founder’s personal savings. The median start-up capital was a 
modest $10,000, and these are successful, fast-growing companies! Slower-
growing companies tend to require even less capital.

285
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
With the initial infusion of capital, many small businesses can propel them-
selves for years after they develop a service or product that brings in more 
cash flow. Jim Gentes, the founder of Giro, the bike helmet manufacturer, 
raised $35,000 from personal savings and loans from family and friends to 
make and distribute his first product and then used the cash flow for future 
products.
 
Eventually, a successful, growing company may want outside financing to 
expand faster. Raising money from investors or lenders is much easier after 
you demonstrate that you know what you’re doing and that a market exists for 
your product or service.
As I explain in the section “Preparing to leave your job,” earlier in this chap-
ter, aspiring entrepreneurs must examine their personal finances for oppor-
tunities to reduce their own spending. If you want to start a company, the 
best time for you to examine your finances is years before you want to hit the 
entrepreneurial path. As with other financial goals, advance preparation can 
go a long way toward helping start a business. The best funding source and 
easiest investor to please is you.
Alan Tripp, founder and CEO of Score Learning, a chain of storefront interac-
tive learning centers, planned for seven years before he took the entrepre-
neurial plunge. He funded his first retail center fully from personal savings. 
He and his wife lived frugally to save the necessary money. Tripp’s first 
center proved the success of his business concept: retail learning centers 
where kids can use computers to improve their reading, math, and science 
skills. With a business plan crafted over time and hard numbers to demon-
strate the financial viability of his operation, Tripp then successfully raised 
funds from investors to open many more centers. (Kaplan Inc. ultimately 
bought out his company.)
Some small-business founders put the cart before the horse and don’t plan 
and save for starting their business the way Tripp did. And in many cases, 
small-business owners want capital but don’t have a clear plan or need for it.
Borrowing from banks
If you’re starting a new business or have been in business for just a few years, 
borrowing, particularly from banks, may be difficult. Borrowing money is 
easier when you don’t really need to do so. No one knows this fact better 
than small-business owners do.
Small-business owners who successfully obtain bank loans do their home-
work. To borrow money from a bank, you generally need a business plan, 
three years of financial statements and tax returns for the business and its 
owner, as well as projections for the business. Hunt around for banks that 
are committed to and understand the small-business marketplace.

286
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
The Small Business Administration (SBA) guarantees some small-business 
loans that banks originate. Because many small businesses lack collateral 
and pose a higher loan risk, banks would not otherwise make many of these 
loans. The SBA, in addition to guaranteeing loans for existing businesses, 
grants about 20 percent of its loans to start-up businesses, which must have 
founders who put up at least a third of the funds needed and demonstrate a 
thorough understanding of the business, ideally through prior related indus-
try experience.
 
The SBA offers a number of workshops and counseling services for small-
business owners. Its SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives) consulting 
services (www.score.org; 800-634-0245) provide free advice and critiques of 
business plans, as well as advice on raising money for your business. The SBA 
charges a nominal fee for seminars. To get more information on SBA’s services 
and how to contact a local office, call 800-827-5722 or visit its Web site at www.
sba.gov.
Other potential sources of financing include the following:
 
 Credit unions can be another source of financial help. They’re often 
more willing to make personal loans to individuals.
 
 Borrowing against the equity in your home or other real estate is also 
advantageous because real estate loans generally entail lower and tax-
deductible interest.
 
 You can use retirement savings plans as another potential source of 
capital. You may be able to borrow against your investment balance, 
and such loans are usually available at competitive rates through 
employer-based plans. Just make sure that you don’t take on too much 
debt and jeopardize your retirement savings.
 
 If you’ve got the itch to get your business going but can’t wait to save 
the necessary money and lack other ways to borrow, the plastic in your 
wallet may be your ticket to operation. You can acquire some credit 
cards at interest rates of 10 percent or less. Because credit cards are 
unsecured loans, if your business fails and you can’t pay back your debt, 
your home equity and assets in retirement accounts aren’t at risk.
 
No matter what type of business you have in mind and how much money you 
think you need to make it succeed, be patient. Start small enough that you 
don’t need outside capital (unless you’re in an unusual situation where your 
window of opportunity is now, but it will close if you don’t get funding soon). 
Starting your business without outside capital instills the discipline required 
for building a business piece by piece over time. The longer you can wait to 
get a loan or an equity investment, the better the terms are for you and your 
business because the risk is lower for the lender or investor.

 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
Borrowing from family and friends
Because they know you and hopefully like and trust you, your family and 
friends may seem like a good source of investment money for your small 
business. They also have the added advantage of offering you better terms 
than a banker, wealthy investor, or a venture capitalist.
 
Before you solicit and accept money from those you love, consider the pitfalls.
 
 First, defaulting on a loan made by a large, anonymous lender if your 
business hits the skids is one thing, but defaulting on a loan from 
your dear relatives can make future Thanksgiving meals mighty 
uncomfortable!
 
 Second, most entrepreneurs receive surprisingly little encouragement 
from people that they’re close to. Most parents, for example, think that 
you’ve severed some of your cerebral synapses if you announce your 
intention to quit your job with lofty job title, decent pay, and benefits. 
The lack of emotional support can discourage you far more than the lack 
of financial support.
 
From entrepreneurs I’ve observed, family investments in a small business 
work best under the following conditions:
 
 You prepare and sign a letter of agreement that spells out the terms 
of the investment or loan, as if you’re doing business with a banker or 
some other investor you know for business purposes only. I also recom-
mend clearly disclosing the risk of losing one’s entire investment. As 
time goes on, people have selective recall. Putting things in writing 
reminds everyone what was agreed to.
 
 You’re quite certain that you can repay the loan.
 
 You can start your business with an equity investment. With an equity 
investment, a person is willing and able to lose all the money invested 
but hopes to hit a home run while helping you with your dream.
Courting investors and selling equity
Beyond family members and friends, private individuals with sufficient 
money — also known as wealthy individuals — are your next best source of 
capital if you want an equity investor (and not a loan from a lender). Before 
you approach wealthy people, you must have a good business plan, which I 
explain how to prepare in Chapter 13. A worthwhile angel investor (a wealthy 
individual who invests in small companies) should have a track record of 

288
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
success with somewhat similar businesses that she’s funded and should 
bring other things to the table besides money, such as strategic advice, 
helpful business contacts, and so on.
Although you want such people to care about your business, it’s best if their 
investment in your business is no more than 5 to 10 percent of their total 
investment portfolio. No one wants to lose money, but doing so is less painful 
if you diversify well. A $10,000 investment from a millionaire is 1 percent of 
his portfolio.
 
Finding people who may be interested in investing isn’t difficult, but you need 
to be persistent and creative. Consider these approaches:
 
 Consulting tax advisors and attorneys you know may have contacts
 
 Networking with successful entrepreneurs in similar fields
 
 Considering customers or suppliers of your business who like your 
business and believe in its potential
Finding your way to wealthy individuals who don’t know you may prove fruit-
ful as well. Alex Popov, whom I introduce at the beginning of this chapter, 
sent hundreds of letters to people who lived in upscale neighborhoods. The 
letter, a one-page summary of Alex’s investment opportunity, got an astound-
ing 5 percent response for interest in receiving a business plan. Ultimately 
through this search method, Popov found one wealthy investor who funded 
his entire deal.
Determining how much of the business you’re selling for the amount invested 
isn’t easy. Basically, the equity percentage should hinge upon what the whole 
business is worth (see Chapter 15 for details on how to value a business). If 
your whole business is worth $500,000 and you’re seeking $100,000 from 
investors, that $100,000 should buy 20 percent of the business.
 
New businesses are the hardest to value — yet another reason you’re best 
off trying to raise money after you demonstrate some success. The farther 
along you are, the lower the risk to an investor and the lower the cost to you 
(in terms of how much equity you must give up) to raise money.
Deciding Whether to Incorporate
Most businesses operate as sole proprietorships, a status limited to one 
owner or a married couple. If you run a sole proprietorship, you report your 
business income and costs on your tax return on Schedule C (Profit or 
Loss From Business), which you attach to your personal income tax return, 
Form 1040.

289
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
Incorporating, which establishes a distinct legal entity under which you do 
business, takes time and costs money. Therefore, incorporation must offer 
some benefits.
Because corporations are legal entities distinct from their owners, they offer 
features that a proprietorship or partnership doesn’t. For example, corpora-
tions can have shareholders who own a piece or percentage of the company. 
These shares can be sold or transferred to other owners, subject to any 
restrictions in the shareholder’s agreement. Corporations also offer continu-
ity of life, which simply means that they can continue to exist despite an 
owner’s death or the owner’s transfer of her stock in the company. In the 
following sections, I detail the other benefits, along with possible drawbacks, 
of incorporating on the way to helping you decide whether incorporating is 
the right choice for you.
 
Don’t waste your money incorporating if you simply want to maintain a 
corporate-sounding name. If you operate as a sole proprietor, you can choose 
to operate under a different business name (“doing business as,” or d.b.a.) 
without the cost and hassles of incorporating.
Liability protection
A major reason to consider incorporation is liability protection. 
Incorporation effectively separates your business from your personal 
finances, thereby better protecting your personal assets from lawsuits 
that may arise from your business.
 
Before you incorporate, ask yourself (and perhaps others in your line of busi-
ness or advisors — legal, tax, and so on — who work with businesses like 
yours) what can or may cause someone to sue you. Then see whether you can 
purchase insurance to protect against these potential liabilities. Insurance is 
superior to incorporation because it pays claims, and people can still sue you, 
even if you’re incorporated. If you incorporate and someone successfully 
sues you, your company must cough up the money for the claim, and doing 
so may sink your business. Only insurance can cover such financially 
destructive claims.
People can also sue you if, for example, they slip and suffer an injury while on 
your property. To cover these types of claims, you can purchase a property 
or premises liability policy from an insurer.
 
Accountants, doctors, and a number of other professionals can buy liability 
insurance. A good place to start searching for liability insurance is through the 
associations for your profession. Even if you’re not a current member, check 
out the associations anyway — you may be able to access the insurance with-
out membership, or you can join the association long enough to sign up. 
(Associations also sometimes offer competitive rates on disability insurance.)

290
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Tax-deductible insurance 
and other benefits
A variety of insurance and related benefits are tax-deductible to corporations 
for all employees. These benefits include the full cost of health and disability 
insurance as well as up to $50,000 in term life insurance per employee.
In addition to insurance, companies that incorporate can also have 
dependent-care plans in which up to $5,000 per employee may be put away 
on a tax-deductible basis for child care and/or care for elderly parents. 
Corporations can also offer cafeteria or flexible spending plans that allow 
employees to pick and choose which benefits they spend their benefit 
dollars on.
If your business isn’t incorporated, you and the other business owner(s) 
can’t deduct the cost of the preceding insurance plans for yourselves. 
However, you can deduct these costs for your employees as well as your 
health insurance costs for yourself and covered family members.
Corporate taxes
Aside from the tax treatment of insurance and other benefits, another differ-
ence between operating as a sole proprietor and as a corporation is that 
the government taxes a corporation’s profits differently than those realized 
in a sole proprietorship. Which is better for your business depends on your 
situation.
Suppose that your business performs well and makes lots of money. If your 
business isn’t incorporated, the government taxes all profits from your busi-
ness on your personal tax return in the year that your company earns those 
profits. If you intend to use these profits to reinvest in your business and 
expand, incorporating can potentially save you some tax dollars (this doesn’t 
work for personal service corporations, such as accounting, legal, and 
medical firms, which pay a higher tax rate).
 
Resist the short-term temptation to incorporate just so you can have money 
left in the corporation taxed at a lower rate. If you want to pay yourself the 
profits in the future, you can end up paying more taxes. Why? Because you 
first pay taxes at the corporate tax rate in the year that your company earns 
the money, and then you pay taxes again on your personal income tax return 
when the corporation pays you.
Another reason not to incorporate, especially in the early months of a busi-
ness, is that you can’t immediately claim the losses for an incorporated 
business on your personal tax return. Because most businesses produce little 
revenue in their early years and have all sorts of start-up expenditures, 
losses are common.

291
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
Making the decision
If you’re totally confused about whether to incorporate because your busi-
ness is undergoing major financial changes, it’s worth getting competent pro-
fessional help. The hard part is knowing where to turn, because finding one 
advisor who can put together all the pieces of the puzzle (financial, legal, and 
taxes) is challenging. Also be aware that you may get wrong or biased advice.
 
Although most attorneys and tax advisors don’t understand the business 
side of business, try to find one who does, or you may also need a business 
advisor. Attorneys who specialize in advising small businesses can help 
explain the legal issues. Tax advisors who perform a lot of work with business 
owners can help explain the tax considerations.
S corporations and limited liability companies: 
The best of both worlds?
Wouldn’t it be nice to get the liability protection 
and other benefits that come with incorporating 
without the tax complications and hassles? 
Well, S corporations or limited liability compa-
nies may be for you.
Subchapter S corporations provide the liability 
protection that comes with incorporation. 
Likewise, the business profit or loss passes 
through to the owner’s personal tax return, so if 
the business shows a loss in some years, the 
owner may claim those losses in the current 
year of the loss on his personal tax return. If you 
plan to take all the profits out of the company 
(instead of reinvesting them), an S corporation 
may make sense for you.
The IRS allows most small businesses to 
operate as S corporations, but not all. In order 
to be an S corporation, a company must be a 
U.S. company, have just one class of stock, and 
have no more than 35 shareholders, who are 
all U.S. residents or citizens and who are not 
partnerships, corporations, or (with certain 
exceptions) trusts.
Limited liability companies (LLCs) offer business 
owners benefits similar to those of S corpora-
tions but are even better in some cases. Like an 
S corporation, an LLC offers liability protection 
for the owners. LLCs also pass the business’s 
profits and losses through to the owner’s per-
sonal income tax returns.
But limited liability companies have fewer 
restrictions regarding shareholders. For exam-
ple, LLCs have no limits on the number of share-
holders, and the shareholders in an LLC can be 
foreigners, corporations, and partnerships.
Compared with S corporations, the only addi-
tional restriction LLCs carry is that sole propri-
etors and professionals can’t always form an 
LLC (although they can in some states). Most 
state laws require you to have at least two part-
ners and not be a professional service firm (for 
example, accounting, legal, or medical).

292
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
If you’ve weighed the factors and you still can’t decide, my advice is to keep 
your business simple — don’t incorporate. Why? Because after you incorpo-
rate, unincorporating takes time and money. Start off your business as a 
sole proprietorship and then take it from there. Wait until the benefits of 
incorporating your business clearly outweigh the costs and drawbacks.
Finding and Keeping Customers
When you write your business plan (see Chapter 13), you need to think about 
your business’s customers. Just as the sun is the center of our solar system, 
everything in your business revolves around your customers. If you take care 
of your customers, they’ll take care of you and your business for many years.
 
The first thing I recommend doing is putting together a mailing list of people 
you know who may be interested in what you’re offering. Draft and mail an 
upbeat, one-page letter that provides an overview of what your business 
offers. As you have news — successes to report, new products and services, 
and so on — do another mailing. Short letters get read more than something 
that looks like another glossy advertising newsletter. Most people are busy 
and don’t care about your business enough to read something lengthy.
In addition to mailings, other successful ways to get the word out and attract 
customers are limited only to your imagination and resourcefulness. 
Consider the following ideas:
 
 If your business idea is indeed innovative or somehow different, or if 
you have grand expansion plans, add some local media people to your 
mailing list and send them the one-page updates on your business, too. 
Newspaper, radio, and even television business reporters are always 
looking for story ideas. Just remember to make your press releases 
informational and not an advertisement.
 
 If your business seeks customers in a specific geographic area, blanket 
that area by mailing your one-page letter or delivering it door to 
door. You can include a coupon that offers your products or services 
at a reduced cost (perhaps at your cost) to get people to try them. 
Make sure that people know that this is a special opening-for-business 
bargain.
 
After you attract customers, treat them as you would like to be treated by a 
business. If customers like your products and services, they not only come 
back to buy more when the need arises, but they also tell others. Satisfied cus-
tomers are every business’s best cost-effective marketers.
I never cease to be amazed by how many businesses have mediocre or poor 
customer service. One reason for poor service is that as your business 
grows, your employees are on the customer service front lines. If you don’t 

293
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
hire good people and give them the proper incentives to service customers, 
many of them won’t do it. For most employees on a salary, the day-to-day 
servicing of customers may be just an annoyance for them.
 
One way to make your staff care about customer service is to base part of 
their pay on the satisfaction of the customers they work with. Tie bonuses and 
increases at review time to this issue. You can easily measure customer satis-
faction with a simple survey form.
Treating the customer right starts the moment that the selling process 
begins. Honesty is an often-underused business tool. More than a few sales-
people mislead and lie in order to close a sale. Many customers discover 
after their purchase that they’ve been deceived, and they get angry. These 
unethical businesses not only likely lose future business from customers but 
also surely — and justifiably — lose referrals.
If your business doesn’t perform well for a customer, apologize and bend 
over backward to make the customer happy. Offer a discount on the problem 
purchase or, if possible, a refund on product purchases. Also, make sure that 
you have a clear return-and-refund policy. Bend that policy if doing so helps 
you satisfy an unhappy customer or rids you of a difficult customer.
Setting Up Shop
No matter what type of business you have in mind, you need space to work 
from, whether it’s a spare room in your home, shared office space, or a small 
factory. You also need to outfit that space with tools of your trade. This 
section explains how to tackle these tasks.
Finding business space and 
negotiating a lease
You may be in the market for office or retail space unless you can run your 
business from your home. Finding good space and buying or leasing it take 
tons of time if you do it right.
 
In the early months and years of your business, buying an office or a retail 
building generally doesn’t make sense. The down payment consumes impor-
tant capital, and you may end up spending lots of time and money on a real 
estate transaction for a location that may not interest you in the long term. 
Buying this type of real estate rarely makes sense unless you plan to stay put 
for five or more years.

294
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Leasing a space for your business is far more practical. Renting office space 
is simpler than renting retail space because a building owner worries less 
about your business and its financial health. Your business needs more credi-
bility to rent retail because your retail business affects the nature of the strip 
mall or shopping center where you lease. Owners of such properties don’t 
want quick failures or someone who does a poor job of running his business.
Because renting retail space is harder, if you and your business don’t 
have a track record with renting space, getting references is useful. If you 
seek well-located retail space, you must compete with national chains 
like Starbucks, so you’d better have an A+ credit rating and track record. 
Consider subletting — circulate flyers to businesses that may have some 
Should you work from home?
You may be able to run a relatively simple small 
business from your home. If you have the choice 
of running your business out of your home 
versus securing outside office space, consider 
the following issues:
  Cost control: As I discuss earlier in this 
chapter, bootstrapping your business can 
make a lot of financial and business sense. 
If you have space in your home that you can 
use, then you’ve found yourself a rent-free 
business space. (If you’re considering 
buying a larger home to have more space, 
then you can’t really say that your home 
office is rent-free.)
  Business issues: What are the needs of 
your business and customers? If you don’t 
require fancy office space to impress others 
or to meet with clients, work at home. If you 
operate a retail business that requires lots 
of customers coming to you, getting outside 
space is probably the best (and legally cor-
rect) choice. Check with the governing 
authorities of your town or city to find out 
what local regulations exist for home-based 
businesses.
  Discipline: At home, do you have the disci-
pline to work the number of hours that you 
need and want, or will the kitchen goodies 
tempt you to make half a dozen snack trips? 
Can you refrain from turning on the televi-
sion every hour for late-breaking news? 
The sometimes amorphous challenge 
of figuring out how to grow the business 
may cause you to focus your energies 
elsewhere.
  Family matters: Last, but not least, your 
home life should factor into where you 
decide to work. One advantage to working 
at home when you’re a parent is that you 
can be a more involved parent. If nothing 
else, you can spend the one to two hours 
per day that many people spend commuting 
with your kids! Just make sure that you try 
to set aside work hours, during which time 
your office is off limits.
 
 Ask other family members how they feel 
about your working at home. Be specific 
about what you plan to do, where, when, 
and how. Will clients come over? What time 
of day and where in the home will you meet 
with them? You may not think that your 
home office is an imposition, but your 
spouse may. Home business problems 
come between many couples. If you’re 
single and living alone, home life is less of 
an issue.

295
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
extra space in the area where you want to locate your business. Also 
prepare financial statements that show your creditworthiness (personally 
and in business).
Brokers list most spaces for lease. Working with a broker can be useful, but 
the same conflicts exist as with residential brokers (see Chapter 12). You 
should also examine spaces for lease without a broker, where you deal with 
the landlord directly. Such landlords may give you a better deal, and they 
don’t worry about recouping a brokerage commission.
 
The biggest headaches with leasing space are understanding and negotiating 
the lease contract. Odds are that the lessor presents you with a standard, 
preprinted lease contract that she says is fair and is the same lease that every-
one else signs. Don’t sign it! This contract is the lessor’s first offer — have an 
expert review it and help you modify it. Find yourself an attorney who regu-
larly deals with such contracts.
Office leases are usually simpler than retail leases. About the most compli-
cated issue you face with office leases is that they can be full service, which 
includes janitorial benefits. Retail leases, however, are always triple-net, 
which means that you as the tenant pay for maintenance (for example, resur-
facing the parking lot, cleaning, and gardening), utilities, and property taxes. 
You’re correct to worry about a triple-net retail lease because you can’t con-
trol many of these expenses. For example, if the property is sold, property 
taxes can jump. Here are provisions to keep in mind when dealing with a 
triple-net lease:
 
 Compare your site’s costs to other sites to evaluate the deal that the 
lessor offers you.
 
 Your lease contract needs to include a cap for the triple-net costs at a 
specified limit per square foot.
 
 Try to make sure that the lease contract doesn’t make you responsible 
for removal costs for any toxic waste you may discover during your 
occupation. Also exclude increased property taxes that the sale of the 
property may cause.
 
 If feasible, get your landlord to pay for remodeling — it’s cheaper for the 
landlord to do it and entails fewer hassles for you.
 
 With retail leases, get an option for renewal — this is critical in retail, 
where location is important. The option should specify the cost — for 
example, something like 5 percent below market, as determined by 
arbitration.
 
 Get an option that the lease can be transferred to a new owner if you sell 
the business.

296
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
If you really think that you want to purchase (not lease) because you can see 
yourself staying in the same place for at least five years, read Chapter 11.
Equipping your business space
You can easily go overboard spending money when leasing or buying 
office space and outfitting that space. The most common reason that small-
business owners spend more than they should is to attempt to project a 
professional, upscale image. You can have an office or retail location that 
works for you and your customers without spending a fortune if you observe 
some simple rules:
 
 Buy — don’t lease or finance — equipment. Unless you’re running a 
manufacturing outfit where the cost of buying equipment is prohibitive, 
try to avoid borrowing and leasing. If you can’t buy office furniture, 
computers, cash registers, and so on with cash, then you probably can’t 
afford them! Buying such things on credit or leasing them — leasing is 
invariably the most expensive way to go — encourages you to spend 
beyond your means.
 
 Consider buying used equipment, especially furniture, which takes 
longer to become obsolete. The more popular a piece of equipment, the 
more beneficial it is for you to purchase rather than lease: If many other 
businesses would be willing to buy the equipment, you’ll have an easier 
time unloading it if you ever want to sell it. Leasing may make more 
sense with oddball-type equipment that is more of a hassle and costly 
for you to unload after a short usage period.
 
 Don’t get carried away with technological and marketing gadgets. 
Many small-business owners I speak with spend all sorts of money on 
items such as laptops, personal digital assistants, and wireless Internet 
connections because they feel the need to be “competitive” and “
current.” Don’t forget the virtues of picking up the phone or meeting 
in person — these forms of communication are much more personal 
ways of doing business.
 
 Voice mail is one device that many small-business owners find worth 
spending money on. Voice mail sounds more professional than an 
answering machine and can handle simultaneous calls with ease. Best of 
all, voice mail can save you money on administrative help.
Bootstrap-equipping your office makes sense within certain limits (see 
“Bootstrapping,” earlier in this chapter). If customers come to you, of course, 
you don’t want a shabby-looking store or office. However, that doesn’t mean 
that you have to purchase the Rolls Royce equivalent of everything that you 
need for your office.

297
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
Accounting for the Money
One of the less glamorous aspects of running your own business is dealing 
with accounting. Unlike when you work for an employer, you must track 
your business’s income, expenses, and taxes (for you and your employees). 
Although you may be able to afford to hire others to help with these dreary 
tasks, you must know the inner workings of your business to keep control of 
your business, to stay out of trouble with the tax authorities, and to minimize 
your taxes. The following sections show you how to handle the accounting 
aspect of your business.
Tax record keeping and payments
With revenue hopefully flowing into your business and expenses surely head-
ing out, you must keep records to help satisfy your tax obligations and to 
keep a handle on the financial status and success of your business. You can’t 
accurately complete the necessary tax forms for your business if you don’t 
properly track your income and expenses. And should the IRS audit you — 
the probability of being audited as a small-business owner is about four times 
higher than when you’re an employee at a company — you’ll need to prove 
some or even all of your expenses and income.
 
In order to keep your sanity, and keep the IRS at bay, make sure that you do 
the following:
 
 Pay your taxes each quarter and on time. When you’re self-employed, 
you’re responsible for the accurate and timely filing of all taxes that 
you owe on your income on a quarterly basis. You must pay taxes by 
the 15th of January, April, June, and September. (If the 15th falls on the 
weekend, however, the payment is due the Monday that follows the 
15th.) To pay correctly, call the IRS at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676) and 
ask for Form 1040-ES (Estimated Tax for Individuals) or download this 
form from its Web site at www.irs.gov. This form comes complete with 
an easy-to-use estimated tax worksheet and four payment coupons that 
you send in with your quarterly tax payments. Mark the due dates for 
your quarterly taxes on your calendar so you don’t forget!
 
 If you have employees, you also need to withhold taxes from each 
paycheck they receive. You must then use the money that you deduct 
from their paychecks to make timely payments to the IRS and to the 
appropriate state authorities. In addition to federal and state income 
tax, you also need to withhold and send in Social Security and any other 
state or locally mandated payroll taxes. Pay these taxes immediately 
after withholding them from your employees’ paychecks and never use 
the money to fund your business needs.

298
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
 
 I recommend using a payroll service to ensure that your payments are 
made on time and correctly to all the different places that these tax 
filings need to go.
 
 Keep your business accounts separate from your personal accounts. 
The IRS knows that small-business owners, as a group, cheat more on 
their tax returns than do company employees. One way that dishonest 
entrepreneurs cheat is hiding business income and inflating business 
expenses. Thus, the IRS looks skeptically at business owners who use 
and commingle funds in personal checking and credit card accounts 
for business transactions.
 
 Although you may find opening and maintaining separate business 
accounts bothersome, do so. And remember to pay for only legitimate 
business expenses through your business account. You’ll be thankful 
come tax preparation time to have separate records. Having separate 
records can also make the IRS easier to deal with if and when you’re 
audited.
 
 Keep good records of your business income and expenses. You can 
use file folders, software, or a shoebox to collect your business income 
and expenses, but just do it! When you need to file your annual return, 
you want to be able to find the documentation that allows you to figure 
your business income and expenses. For most people, the file folder 
system works best. If your business is small, one folder for income and 
one for your expenses will do. Computer software can help you with this 
drudgery as well. Because you must go through the hassle of entering 
the data, software is more useful with larger small businesses and in 
those businesses that process lots of checks or expenses.
 
 Charging expenses on a credit card or writing a check can make the 
documentation for most businesses easier. These methods of payment 
leave a paper trail that simplifies the task of tallying up your expenses 
come tax time and make the IRS auditor less grumpy in the event that he 
audits you. (Just make sure that you don’t overspend, as many people 
do with credit cards!)
In addition to keeping good records, you also need to decide on what basis, 
cash or accrual, you want your company to keep its books.
 
 Most small-business owners use the cash method, which simply means 
that for tax purposes, you recognize or report income in the year it’s 
received and expenses in the year they’re paid.
 
 The accrual method, by contrast, records income when the sale is made, 
even if the customer hasn’t yet paid; expenses are recognized when 
incurred even if your business hasn’t paid the bill yet.

299
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S and personal service corporations 
generally can use the cash method. C corporations and partnerships that 
have C corporations as partners may not use the cash accounting method.
 
The advantage of operating on a cash basis is that you can control the 
amount of your business income and expenses that your business reports 
for tax purposes year to year. Doing so can lower your tax bill. Suppose that, 
looking ahead to the next tax year, you have good reason to believe that 
your business will make more money, pushing you into a higher tax bracket. 
You can likely reduce your tax bill if you pay more of your expenses in the 
next year. For example, instead of buying a new computer late this year, 
wait until early next year. (Note: The IRS recognizes credit card expenses 
by the date when you make the charges, not when you pay the bill.) Likewise, 
you can somewhat control when your customers pay you. If you expect to 
make less money next year, simply don’t invoice customers in December of 
this year. Wait until January so that you receive the income from those sales

How to (legally) pay lower taxes
Every small business must spend money, and spending money in your busi-
ness holds the allure of lowering your tax bill. But don’t spend money on 
your business just for the sake of generating tax deductions. Spend your 
money to make the most of the tax breaks that you can legally take. The 
following are some examples of legal tax breaks:
 
 Take it all off now or spread it around for later. As a small-business 
owner, if you have net income, you can deduct up to $128,000 (for tax 
year 2008) per year for equipment purchases (for example, espresso 
machines, computers, desks, and chairs) for use in your business. 
By deducting via a Section 179 deduction, you can immediately deduct 
the entire amount that you spend on equipment for your business. 
Normally, equipment for your business is depreciated over a number 
of years. With depreciation, you claim a tax deduction yearly for a 
portion of the total purchase price of the equipment. For example, if 
you drop two grand on a new computer, you can take a $400 deduction 
annually for this computer’s depreciation (if you elect straight-line 
depreciation). If you elect the special 179 deduction, you can claim the 
entire $2,000 outlay at once (as long as you haven’t exceeded the 
$128,000 annual cap).

Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
 
 Taking all the deduction in one year by using the Section 179 deduction 
method is enticing, but you may pay more taxes in the long run that 
way. Consider that in the early years of most businesses, profits are 
low. When your business is in a low tax bracket, the value of your deduc-
tions is low. If your business grows, you may come out ahead if you 
depreciate your early-year big-ticket expenses, thereby postponing to 
higher-tax-bracket years some of the deductions that you can take off.
 
 Make the most of your auto deductions. If you use your car for busi-
ness, you can claim a deduction, but don’t waste a lot of money on a 
car, thinking that the IRS helps pay for all of it — because it doesn’t. 
The IRS limits how large an annual auto expense you can claim for 
depreciation. Another advantage of purchasing a more reasonably 
priced car: You won’t be burdened with documenting your actual auto 
expenses and calculating depreciation. You can use the auto expense 
method of just claiming a flat 50.5 cents per mile (tax year 2008).
 
 Deduct travel, meal, and entertainment expenses. For the IRS to 
consider your expense deductible, your travel must be for a bona fide 
business purpose. For example, if you live in Chicago, fly to Honolulu 
for a week, and spend one day at a seminar for business purposes and 
then the other six days snorkeling and sunning, you can deduct only the 
expenses for the one day of your trip that you devoted to business. (An 
exception to this rule enables you to write off more of your trip: If you 
extend a business trip to stay over a Saturday night to qualify for a lower 
airfare and you save money in total travel costs, you can claim the extra 
costs that you incurred to stay over through Sunday!)
 
 Don’t waste your money on meal and entertainment expenses. You can 
deduct only 50 percent of your business expenses; by all means, take 
that 50 percent deduction when you can legally do so, but don’t spend 
frivolously on business trips and think that you can deduct everything. 
The IRS doesn’t allow business deductions for club dues (such as for 
health, business, airport, or social clubs) or entertainment (such as 
executive boxes at sports stadiums).
Keeping a Life and Perspective
David Packard, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, said, “You are likely to die not 
of starvation for opportunities, but of indigestion of opportunities.”
Most small businesses succeed in keeping their owners more than busy — in 
some cases, too busy. If you provide needed products or services at a fair 
price, customers will beat a path to your door. Your business will grow and 
be busier than what you can personally handle. You may need to start hiring 
people. I know small-business owners who work themselves into a frenzy and 
put in 70 or more hours a week.

301
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
If you enjoy your work so much so that it’s not really work and you end up 
putting in long hours because you enjoy it, terrific! But success in your com-
pany can cause you to put less energy into other important aspects of your 
life that perhaps don’t come as easily.
 
Although careers and business successes are important, don’t place these 
successes higher than fourth on your overall priority list. You can’t replace 
your health, family, and friends — but you can replace a job or a business.

E
ach year, hundreds of thousands of small businesses change hands. 
This chapter is for those of you who want to run or invest in an existing 
small business but don’t want to start the business yourself. And of course, 
this chapter can show you how to make good money and have fun along 
the way!
Examining the Advantages of Buying
I don’t want to scare you off if you want to start a business. However, buying 
someone else’s business works better for some people than others. The fol-
lowing list reflects the main advantages of buying a business:
 
 You avoid start-up hassles and headaches. Starting a business from 
scratch requires dealing with many issues. In the early years, beyond 
formulating a business plan, you must also deal with a variety of issues, 
such as developing a marketing plan, finding customers, locating space, 
hiring employees, and incorporating. If you buy a good existing busi-
ness, you buy into an ongoing enterprise with customers, assets, 
and hopefully profits (although you still need to fix any problems the 
business may have).
 
 Think about the learning curve for the type of business you’re consider-
ing purchasing. Buying an existing business makes more sense if the 
business is complicated. For example, purchasing a business that manu-
factures musical instruments makes more sense than purchasing a 
plumbing business that requires plumbing know-how and a few tools to 
start up. Unless you’ve built musical instruments before and understand 

304
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
the intricacies of the production process, starting such a business from 
scratch is quite risky and perhaps foolhardy. (However, purchasing an 
existing plumbing business may still make sense if, for example, you 
don’t want to build a stable of customers from scratch.)
 
 You reduce risk. Although investing in something with a solid track 
record is still far from a sure thing, your risk may be significantly lower 
than the risk involved in a start-up. After a business has an operating 
history and offers a product or service with a demonstrated market, 
some of the risk in the company is removed. Looking at historic financial 
statements also helps you make more accurate financial forecasts than 
you could make with a start-up venture.
 
 You enhance your ability to attract investor or lender money. You 
should have less difficulty raising money from investors and lenders for 
your existing business than with a start-up. Attracting most investors 
to something that’s more than an idea is easier. And for the amount that 
they invest, investors demand a smaller piece of an existing business 
than they would with an investment in an idea.
 
 You want to enter a business where buying an existing business is 
your only ticket in. You can enter some businesses — such as bottlers 
or car dealerships — only through your purchase of a business that 
already exists.
 
 You can find businesses where you can add value. Some entrepreneurs 
who start businesses don’t see the potential for growth or don’t want 
to grow their business — they may be burned out, content with their 
current profit, or simply ready to retire. Finding businesses where the 
potential exists to improve operating efficiency and to expand into new 
markets isn’t too hard. Relative to investing in stocks or real estate (see 
Parts II and III), finding small companies that are undervalued relative to 
the potential that they can offer is easier for a business-minded person.
 
 Just because you think that you see potential to improve a business, 
don’t pay a high price based on your high expectations. You can be 
wrong — you may be looking at the business through rose-colored 
glasses. Even if you’re correct about the potential, don’t pay the current 
owner for the hard work and ingenuity that you’ll bring to the business 
if you purchase it. Offer a fair price based on the value of the business 
now — I explain how to figure this value in the section “Evaluating a 
Small Business,” later in this chapter.
Understanding the Drawbacks of Buying
Just as everyone doesn’t enjoy running or cooking, some people don’t enjoy 
the negatives that come with buying an existing business. If the following 
issues don’t turn you off, purchasing an existing business may be right 
for you:

305
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
 
 You buy the baggage. When you buy an existing business, the bad 
comes with the good, and all businesses include their share of the bad. 
The business may employ problem employees, for example, or it may 
have a less-than-stellar reputation in the marketplace. Even if the 
employees are good, they and the company culture may not mesh with 
where you want to take the company in the future.
 
 Do you have the ability to motivate people to change — or to fire them 
if they don’t? Do you have the patience to work at improving the compa-
ny’s products and reputation? You need these types of skills and traits 
to run and add value to a company. Some people enjoy and thrive on 
such challenges, and others find such pressures hard to swallow. 
Think back on your other work experiences for information about what 
challenges you’ve tackled and how you felt about them.
 
 You need to do a lot of inspection. If you think that buying a company 
is easier than starting one, think again. You must know what you’re 
buying before you buy. So you need to do a thorough inspection, per-
form due diligence, kick the tires, or whatever you want to call it. For 
example, you need to rip apart financial statements to ascertain whether 
the company is really as profitable as it appears and to determine its 
financial health.
 
 After you close the deal and the checks and/or money are transferred, 
you can’t change your mind. Unless a seller commits fraud or lies (which 
is difficult and costly for a buyer to legally prove), it’s “buyer beware” 
about the quality of the business you’re buying. In “Evaluating a Small 
Business,” later in this chapter, I cover the homework that you need 
to do before you buy.
 
 You need more capital. Existing businesses have value, which is 
why you generally need more money to buy a business than to 
start one. If you’re short of cash, starting a company is generally a 
lower-cost path.
 
 Lower risk means lower returns. If you purchase a good business and 
run it well, you can make decent money. In some cases, you can make a 
lot of money. But you generally have less upside and potential for hitting 
it really big than with a business you start. Those who have built the 
greatest wealth from small businesses are generally those who have 
started them rather than those who bought existing ones.
 
 You don’t get the satisfaction of creating a business. Whether for your 
ego or your psyche, entrepreneurs who build their own businesses get a 
different experience than those who buy someone else’s enterprise. You 
can make your mark on a business that you buy, but doing so takes a 
number of years. Even then, the business is never completely your 
own creation.

306
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Prerequisites to Buying a Business
Not everyone is cut out to succeed when buying an existing business. Even if 
you have sufficient funds for the purchase, you may be blind to a whole host 
of problems and pitfalls and can end up losing your entire investment.
Conversely, some people with little money for buying a business succeed 
wildly. You can purchase a good small business with little and, in rare 
cases, no money down. So what, then, are the traits common to people who 
successfully buy and operate an existing small business?
Business experience
First, you should have business experience and background. If you were an 
economics or business major in college and you took accounting and other 
quantitatively oriented courses, you’re off to a good start.
 
Even better than academic learning is work experience in the type of business 
that you want to buy. If you want to run a restaurant, go work in one. Consider 
the experience as paid on-the-job training for running your own restaurant.
If you’ve worked as a consultant on business-management issues with a vari-
ety of industries, you also have a good background. However, the danger in 
having done only consulting is that you’re usually not on the front lines, 
where most of the serious business operational issues arise.
Should none of the previous examples apply to you, I won’t say that 
you’re doomed to fail if you buy a business, but I will say that the odds are 
against you.
 
If you don’t have business experience, you’ll likely do far better in your first 
business venture after some remedial work. Get some hands-on experience, 
which is more valuable than any degree or credential that you can earn 
through course work. There’s no substitute for the real-life experiences of 
marketing to and interacting with customers, grappling with financial state-
ments, dealing with competitive threats, and doing the business of business. 
However, I don’t endorse skipping academic course work. You may, in fact, be 
required to get a credential to be able to do the work that you want to do. If 
you don’t need a specific credential, taking selected courses and reading good 
business books (I recommend some in Chapter 18) can boost your knowledge.
Financial resources
To purchase a business, as with real estate, you need to make a down pay-
ment on the purchase price. In most cases, you must put down 25 to 30 

307
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
percent. Bankers and business sellers who make loans to business buyers 
normally require such down payments to protect their loan. Small-business 
buyers who make sizeable down payments are less likely to walk away from a 
loan obligation if the business gets into financial trouble.
 
If you lack sufficient capital for a down payment, try asking family or friends 
to invest. You can also set your sights on a less expensive business or seek 
business owners willing to accept a smaller down payment. If you can find 
a business for sale where the owner wants less than 20 percent down, you 
may be on to something good. Be careful, though, because an owner who 
accepts such a small down payment may have a difficult time selling because 
of problems inherent in the business or because the business is overpriced.
You can purchase some existing small businesses with a loan from the 
selling owner. Also, check for loans with banks in your area that specialize in 
small-business loans. (See Chapter 14 for other financing ideas.)
Focusing Your Search 
for a Business to Buy
Unless you’re extraordinarily lucky, finding a good business to buy takes a 
great deal of time. If you spend time outside of your work hours, finding a 
quality business right for you to buy can easily take a year or two. Even if you 
can afford to look full time, finding and closing on a business can still take 
you many months.
 
Above all else, it pays to be persistent, patient, and willing to spend time on 
things that don’t lead immediately to results. You must be willing to sort 
through some rubbish. If you require immediate gratification in terms of com-
pleting a deal, you can make yourself miserable in your search or rush into a 
bad deal.
You’re going to end up spinning your wheels (and likely end up with the 
wrong type of business for yourself) unless you set some boundaries for your 
business search. You don’t need to be rigid or to precisely define every detail 
of the business that you want to purchase, but you do need to set some 
parameters so you can start laying the groundwork to purchase.
 
Each person has unique shopping criteria. The following list exemplifies some 
useful ones to narrow your search:
 
 Size/purchase price: The money you have available to invest in a busi-
ness determines the size of business that you can afford. As a rough 
rule, figure that you can afford to pay a purchase price of about three 
times the amount of cash you have earmarked for the business. For 

308
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
example, if you have $50,000 in the till, you should look at buying a busi-
ness for about $150,000. Because many business sellers overprice their 
businesses, you can probably look at businesses listed at a price above 
$150,000, perhaps as high as $200,000.
 
 Location: If you’re already rooted and don’t want to move or deal 
with a long commute, the business’s location further narrows the field. 
Although you may be willing to look at a broader territory, maybe 
even nationally if you’re willing to relocate, evaluating businesses long-
distance is difficult and costly. Unless you want a highly specialized type 
of company, try to keep your business search local.
 
 Industry: Industry-specific expertise that you want to use in the busi-
ness you buy can help whittle the pool of businesses down further. If 
you don’t have industry-specific expertise, I highly recommend that you 
focus on some specific niches in industries that interest you or that you 
know something about. Focusing on an industry helps you conduct a 
more thorough search and find higher-quality companies. The industry 
knowledge that you accumulate in your search process can pay big divi-
dends during your years of ownership in the business.
 
 If you have a hard time brainstorming about specific industries, use this 
trick to jump-start your creativity — take a walk through the Yellow 
Pages! Many business types known to exist in your area are listed alpha-
betically. Remember that a separate Yellow Pages directory exists for 
businesses that sell mainly to consumers; a business-to-business yellow 
pages directory lists businesses whose customers are primarily other 
businesses. Look at either or both, depending on the types of businesses 
that interest you. You also may want to buy a business in a sector that is 
experiencing fast growth so that you, too, can ride the wave. Check out 
Inc. magazine’s annual Inc. 5,000 list of the fastest-growing private com-
panies in America.
 
 Opportunity to add value: Some buyers want to purchase a business 
with untapped opportunities or problems that need fixing. As with 
real estate, however, many people are happier leaving the fixer-uppers 
to the contractors. Some businesses without major problems can offer 
significant untapped potential.
After you define your shopping criteria, you’re ready to go to the market-
place of businesses for sale. I recommend that you type up your criteria on 
a single page so you can hand it to others who may put you in touch with 
businesses for sale. The following sections give you the best techniques for 
identifying solid businesses that meet your needs.
Perusing publications
If you’re focused on specific industry sectors, you may be surprised to find 
out that all sorts of specialty newsletters and magazines are published. Just 

309
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
think of the fun you can have reading publications such as the Alternative 
Energy Retailer, Specialty Foods Merchandising, Coal Mining Newsletter, 
Advanced Battery Technology, or Gas Turbine World! Specialty publications get 
you into the thick of an industry and also contain ads for businesses for sale 
or business brokers who work in the industry.
 
A useful reference publication that you can find in public libraries with 
decent business sections is a two-volume set titled Small Business Sourcebook 
(Gale). Organized alphabetically by industry, this reference contains listings 
of publications, trade associations, and other information sources.
Conducting literature searches of general interest business publications can 
help you identify articles on your industry of interest. The Reader’s Guide to 
Periodicals and online computer searches can help you find the articles. Web 
sites worth examining include www.bizbuysell.com and www.sba.gov.
Networking with advisors
 
Speak with accountants, attorneys, bankers, and business consultants who 
specialize in working with small businesses. These advisors are sometimes 
the first to hear of a small-business owner’s desire to sell. Advisors may also 
suggest good businesses that aren’t for sale but whose owners may consider 
selling (see the next section).
Knocking on some doors
Some business owners who haven’t listed their businesses for sale may be 
thinking about selling, so if you approach enough businesses that interest 
you, you may find some of these not-yet-on-the-market businesses with 
owners interested in selling. You can increase the possibility of finding your 
desired business, and you may get a good deal on such a business because 
you can negotiate with such a seller from the beneficial position of not having 
to compete with other potential buyers.
 
Instead of calling on the phone or literally knocking on the business’s door, 
start your communications by mail. Sending a concise letter of introduction 
explaining what kind of business you’re looking for and what a wonderful 
person you are demonstrates that you’re investing some time in this 
endeavor. Follow up with a call a week or so after you send the letter.
Working with business brokers
Numerous small businesses for sale list their enterprises through business 
brokers. Just as a real estate agent makes a living selling real estate, a busi-
ness broker makes a living selling businesses.

310
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Business brokers generally sell smaller small businesses — those with less 
than $1 million in annual sales. These businesses tend to be family-owned or 
sole proprietorships, such as restaurants, dry cleaners, other retailers, and 
service firms. About half of such small businesses are sold through brokers. 
Most business brokerage firms sell different types of businesses. Some firms, 
however, specialize in one industry or a few industries.
One advantage of working with brokers to buy a business is that a broker can 
expose you to other businesses you may not have considered (a doughnut 
shop, for example, instead of a restaurant). Brokers can also share their 
knowledge with you — like the fact that you need to get up at 4 a.m. to make 
doughnuts. Still want to buy a doughnut shop?
 
The pitfalls of working with brokers are numerous:
 
 Commission: Brokers aren’t your business advisors; they’re salespeo-
ple. That fact doesn’t make them corrupt or dishonest, but it does mean 
that their interests aren’t aligned with yours. Their goal is to do a deal 
and do the deal soon. And the more you pay for your business, the more 
they make. Business brokers typically get paid 10 to 12 percent of the 
sales price of the business. Technically, the seller pays this fee, but as 
with real estate deals done through brokers, the buyer actually pays. 
Remember, if a broker isn’t involved, the seller can sell for a lower price 
and still clear more money, and the buyer is better off, too.
 
 Undesirable businesses: Problem businesses are everywhere, but a fair 
number end up with brokers when the owners encounter trouble selling 
on their own.
 
 Packaging: This problem relates to the preceding two. Brokers help not-
so-hot businesses look better than they really are. Doing so may involve 
lying, but more typically, it involves stretching the truth, omitting nega-
tives, and hyping potential. (Owners who sell their business themselves 
may do these things as well.)
 
 You (and your advisors) need to perform the due diligence on a busi-
ness that you may buy. Never, ever trust or use the selling package that 
a broker prepares for a business as your sole source of information. 
Remember: Brokers, as well as sellers, can stretch the truth, lie, and 
commit fraud.
 
 Access to limited inventory: Unlike real estate brokers (who can access 
all homes listed with brokers for sale in an area through a shared listing 
service), a business broker can generally tell you only about his office’s 
listings. (Confidentiality is an issue because a shared listing service 
increases the number of people who can find out that a business is for 
sale and the particulars of the sale. This may cause some customers to 
find another company to do business with and may lead some key 
employees to leave as well.)

311
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
 
 If you want to work with a business broker, use more than one. Working 
with a larger business brokerage firm or one that specializes in listing 
the type of business that you’re looking for can maximize the number of 
possible prospects that you see. Some state associations of business 
brokers share their listings. However, even in such states, some of the 
larger brokerages opt to not include themselves because they benefit 
less from sharing their information.
 
 Few licensing requirements: The business brokerage field isn’t tightly 
regulated. The majority of states have no requirements — anyone can 
hang out a shingle and work as a business broker. Some states allow 
those with securities brokerage licenses to operate as business brokers, 
whereas most states require real estate licenses.
You can find business brokers in the Yellow Pages under “Business Brokers.” 
Ads for businesses for sale may lead you to a broker as well. You can also 
ask tax, legal, and business consultants for names of good brokers they may 
know. If you find a broker you think you’d like to work with, check references 
from other buyers who have worked with the broker. Be sure that the broker 
works full time and has solid experience. Some business brokers dabble in it 
part time and make a living in other ways.
 
Ask the broker you’re interested in for the names of several buyers of similar 
businesses whom they’ve worked with over the past six months. By narrowing 
down the field to only your particular business interest, the broker can’t just 
refer you to the three best deals of his career. Also, check whether anyone 
has filed complaints against the brokerage with the local Better Business 
Bureau (although the BBB favors member companies more and is less likely 
to entertain and retain complaints against members) and state regulatory 
departments (real estate, attorney general, department of corporations, and 
so on) that oversee business brokers.
Considering a Franchise or Multilevel 
Marketing Company
Among the types of businesses that you may buy are franchises and multi-
level marketing companies. Both of these types of businesses offer more of a 
prepackaged and defined system for running a business. Although both types 
may be worth your exploration, significant pitfalls can trip you up, especially 
with multilevel marketing companies.
Finding a franchise
Purchasing a good franchise can be your ticket into the world of small-
business ownership. Some companies expand their locations through selling 

312
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
replicas, or franchises, of their business. When you purchase a franchise, you 
buy the local rights to a specified geographic territory to sell the company’s 
products or services under the company’s name and to use the company’s 
system of operation. In addition to an upfront franchisee fee, franchisers also 
typically charge an ongoing royalty.
Franchising makes up a huge part of the business world. Companies that 
franchise — such as McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, H&R Block, Midas Muffler, 7-11 
stores, Gymboree, Century 21 Real Estate, Holiday Inn, Avis, Subway, and 
Foot Locker — account for more than $1 trillion in sales annually.
Franchise advantages
When you purchase a new franchise, you don’t already have customers — 
just like starting a business, you must find them, although the parent 
company should have a track record and multiple locations with customers. 
(You can also purchase existing franchises from owners who want to sell.)
So why would you want to pay a good chunk of money to buy a business 
without customers?
 
 Proven business: A company that has been in business for a number of 
years and has successful franchisees proves the demand for the compa-
ny’s products and services and shows that the company’s system for 
providing those products and services works. The company has worked 
out the bugs and hopefully solved common problems. As a franchise 
owner, you benefit from and share in the experience that the parent 
company has gained over the years.
 
 Name-brand recognition: Some consumers recognize the company 
name of a larger and successful franchise company and may be more 
inclined to purchase its products and services. Some consumers feel 
more comfortable getting a muffler job done at franchiser Midas Muffler 
rather than hunting around and calling Discount Muffler World or 
Manny’s Muffler Bazaar from a yellow pages listing. The comfort that 
comes from dealing with Midas may stem from the influence of adver-
tisements, recommendations of friends, or your own familiarity with 
Midas’s services, perhaps in another part of the country. Most free-
standing small businesses for sale in a community lack name-brand 
recognition.
 
 Centralized purchasing power: You would hope and expect that Midas, 
as a corporation made up of hundreds of locations, buys mufflers at a 
low price — volume purchasing generally leads to bigger discounts. In 
addition to possibly saving franchisees money on supplies, the parent 
company can also take the hassle out of figuring out where and how 
to purchase supplies. Again, most unattached small businesses that 
you could buy won’t offer this advantage, although quality business 
associations can provide some of these benefits.

313
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
Franchise pitfalls
 
As with purchasing other small businesses, pitfalls abound in buying a 
franchise. Franchises aren’t for everyone. Here are some common problems 
that may cause you to reconsider buying a franchise:
 
 You’re not the franchise type. When you buy a franchise, you buy into 
an established system. People who like structure and following estab-
lished rules and systems adapt more easily to the franchise life. But if 
you’re the creative sort who likes to experiment and change things, you 
may be an unhappy franchisee. Unlike starting your own business, 
where you can get into the game without investing lots of your time and 
money, buying a franchise that you end up not enjoying can make for 
an expensive learning experience.
 
 You may be locked in to buying overpriced supplies. Centralized, 
bulk purchasing through the corporate headquarters supposedly saves 
franchisees time and money on supplies and other expenditures. Some 
franchisers, however, take advantage of franchisees through large 
markups on proprietary items that franchisees must buy from the 
franchisers.
 
 The franchise is unproven. If the company’s concept hasn’t stood the 
test of time, don’t make yourself a guinea pig. Some franchisers show 
more interest in simply selling franchises to collect the upfront franchise 
money. Reputable franchisers want to help their franchisees succeed so 
they can collect an ongoing royalty from the franchisees’ sales.
 
 The franchise is a pyramid scheme. Unscrupulous, short-term-focused 
business owners sometimes attempt to franchise their businesses and 
sell as many franchises as they can as quickly as possible. Some push 
their franchisees to sell franchises. The business soon focuses on selling 
franchises rather than operating a business that sells a product or 
service well. In rare cases, franchisers engage in fraud and sell next to 
nothing, except the hopes of getting rich quick.
Evaluating a franchise
Make sure that you do plenty of homework before you agree to buy a 
franchise. You may be tempted to cut corners in reviewing a franchise from 
a long-established company. Don’t. You may not be right for the specific 
franchise, or perhaps the “successful” company has mostly been good at 
keeping problems under wraps.
In “Evaluating a Small Business,” later in this chapter, I explain the homework 
you should complete prior to buying an existing business. Read that section, 
especially if you want to purchase an existing franchise from another 
franchisee.

Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Considering a multilevel 
marketing company
 
A twist, and in most cases a bad one, on the franchising idea is multilevel 
marketing (MLM) companies. Sometimes known as network companies, MLMs 
can be thought of as a poor person’s franchise. I know dozens of people, from 
clients I’ve worked with to students I’ve taught in my courses, who have been 
sorely disappointed with the money and time they’ve spent on MLMs.
 
In companies that use multilevel marketing, representatives who work as inde-
pendent contractors solicit customers as well as recruit new representatives, 
known in the industry as your downline. For those weary of traditional jobs, 
the appeal of multilevel marketing is obvious. You can work at home, part 
time if you want. You have no employees. You don’t need any experience. Yet 
you’re told you can still make big bucks ($10,000, $25,000, $50,000, or more per 
month). If your parents raised you right, however, you should be skeptical of 
deals like these.
A big problem to watch out for is the business equivalent of the pyramid 
scheme — businesses that exist to sign up other people. Beware MLM com-
panies that advocate that you “Sell directly to those that you have direct 
influence over. The system works great because you don’t need to resell 
month after month. It’s an opportunity for anybody — it’s up to them how 
much work they want to put into it.”
Work-from-home “opportunities”
“We made $18,269.56 in just 21/2 weeks! 
Remarkable, home-based business! We do over 
90 percent of the work for you! Free info: 
800-555-8975.”
“You can be earning $4,000 to $10,000 each 
month in less than 30 days! We’ll even help you 
hire agents to do the work for you . . . FREE!”
You can find lots of ad copy like this, especially 
in magazines that small-business owners and 
wannabe small-business owners read. In most 
cases, these ads come from grossly overhyped 
multilevel marketing companies. In other ads, 
no legitimate company exists; instead, a person 
(or two or three) simply tries to sell you some 
“information” that explains the business oppor-
tunity. This information may cost several hun-
dred dollars or more. Such packages end up 
being worthless marketing propaganda and 
rarely provide useful information that you 
couldn’t find at a far lower cost or no cost 
at all.
Never buy into anything like these ads that 
companies (or people) pitch to you through the 
mail or over the phone.

315
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
 
Any MLM examination should start with the company’s product or service. 
How does its product or service stack up to the competition on price and 
quality? Contact the Better Business Bureau in the city where the MLM 
company is headquartered to see what kinds of complaints are on file.
 
The bottom line on any network marketing “opportunity” is to remember that 
it’s a job. No company is going to pay you a lot of money for little work. As 
with any other small-business venture, if you hope to earn a decent income, 
multilevel marketing opportunities require at least three to five years of low 
income to build up your business. Most people who pay to buy into networks 
make little money, and many quit and move on.
Also, think twice before you sign up relatives, friends, and co-workers — 
often the first people whom network marketers encourage you to sell to. A 
danger in doing business with those people whom you have influence over is 
that you put your reputation and integrity on the line. You could be putting 
your friendships and family relations on the line as well.
 
Do your homework and remember that due diligence requires digging for facts 
and talking to people who don’t have a bias or reason to sell to you. Do the 
same homework that I recommend for franchises in the “Evaluating a Small 
Business” section, later in this chapter. Be skeptical of multilevel marketing 
systems, unless the company has a long track record and many people who 
are happy. Assume that an MLM company isn’t worth pursuing until your 
extensive due diligence proves otherwise.
Evaluating a Small Business
If you put in many hours, you may eventually come across a business that 
interests and intrigues you so much that you consider purchasing it. As 
with purchasing a piece of real estate, major hurdles stand between you 
and ownership of the business. You need to inspect what you want to buy, 
negotiate a deal, and finalize a contract — done correctly, these processes 
take a lot of time.
Doing due diligence
The American legal system presumes a person is innocent until a jury proves 
that person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. When you purchase a 
business, however, you must assume that the selling business owner is guilty 
of making the business appear better than what it is (and possibly lying) 
until you prove otherwise.

316
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
I don’t want to sound cynical, but a business owner can use more than a few 
tricks to make a business look more profitable, financially healthier, and 
more desirable than it really is. You can’t decide how much inspection or due 
diligence to conduct on a business based on your gut-level feeling.
 
Because you can’t guess what hidden surprises exist in a business, you must 
dig for them. Until you prove to yourself beyond a reasonable doubt that 
these surprises don’t exist, don’t go through with a business purchase.
When you find a business that you think you want to purchase, you abso-
lutely, positively must do your homework before you buy. However, just as 
with purchasing a home, you don’t want to expend buckets of money and 
Quality multilevel marketing 
companies are the exception
A number of network companies have achieved 
success over the years. Amway, Herbalife, and 
Mary Kay have stood the test of time and 
achieved significant size. Amway founders 
Richard De Vos and Jay Van Andel achieved 
multibillionaire status.
Not all multilevel companies are created equal, 
and few are worth a look. However, Mary Kay, 
which sells primarily makeup and skin care 
products, is an example of a successful net-
work company with a 30-plus year history. Mary 
Kay has hundreds of thousands of sales repre-
sentatives and does business worldwide. 
Although not shy about the decent money that 
its more successful salespeople make, Mary 
Kay doesn’t hype the income potential. Local 
sales directors typically earn $50,000 to $100,000 
per year, but this income comes after many 
years of hard work. Mary Kay rewards top 
sellers with gifts, such as the famous pink 
Cadillac.
The ingredients for Mary Kay’s success include 
competitive pricing, personal attention, and 
social interaction, which many stores don’t or 
can’t offer their customers. “We make shopping 
and life fun . . . we make people look and feel 
good,” says Mary Gentry, one of Mary Kay’s 
sales directors.
Mary Kay encourages prospective Mary Kay 
reps to try the products first and then host a 
group before they sign up and fork over the $100 
to purchase a showcase of items to sell. To 
maximize sales, the company encourages Mary 
Kay representatives to keep a ready inventory 
because customers tend to buy more when 
products are immediately available. If reps want 
out of the business, they can sell their inventory 
back to the company at 90 cents on the dollar 
originally paid, a good sign that the company 
stands behind its product.
Quality multilevel marketing companies make 
sense for people who really believe in and want 
to sell a particular product or service and don’t 
want to or can’t tie up a lot of money buying a 
franchise or other business. Just remember to 
check out the MLM company, and realize that 
you won’t get rich in a hurry, or probably ever.

317
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
time on detailed inspections until you can reach an agreement with the seller. 
What if you deal with a seller who is unrealistic about what the business is 
worth? You need to perform the most serious, time-consuming, and costly 
due diligence after you have an accepted offer to purchase a business. Make 
such inspections a contingency in your purchase contract.
Ultimately, if you’re going to buy a business, you need to follow a plan similar 
to, but likely shorter than, the business plan I present in Chapter 13. 
Addressing such issues in a plan goes a long way toward helping you perform 
your due diligence.
 
Following are some additional questions that you need to answer about a 
business you’re contemplating purchasing. (Address as many of the questions 
as possible before you make your offer.)
 
 Why is the owner selling? Ask the owner or the owner’s advisors why 
the owner wants to sell and why now. The answer may shed insight on 
the owner’s motivations and need to sell. Some owners want to bail 
when they see things getting worse.
 
 What is the value of the assets that you want to buy? This value 
includes not only equipment but also “soft” assets, such as the firm’s 
name and reputation with customers and suppliers, customer lists, 
patents, and so on. Interview key employees, customers, suppliers, 
advisors, and competitors. Ask key customers and key employees 
whether they would still be loyal to the business if you took it over.
 
 What do the financial statements reveal? Search for the same things 
that you would look for in a company whose stock you’re considering 
purchasing. (See Chapter 6 for how to read financial statements and 
what to look for.) Don’t take the financial statements at face value 
simply because they’re audited. The accountant who did the audit may 
be incompetent or chummy with the seller.
 
 One way to check for shenanigans is to ask the seller for a copy of the 
business’s tax returns. Owners are more likely to try to minimize 
reported revenue and maximize expenses on their tax return to keep 
from paying more tax. After you have an accepted purchase offer, ask a 
tax advisor experienced in such matters to do an audit (see the 
“Questioning profits” sidebar in this chapter for more information).
 
 If the company leases its space, what does the lease contract say? A 
soon-to-expire lease at a low rate can ruin a business’s profit margins. 
With a retail location, the ability to maintain a good location is also vital. 
Check comparables — that is, what other similar locations lease for — to 
see whether the current lease rate is fair, and talk to the building owner 
to discover his plans for the building. Ask for and review (with the help 
of a legal advisor) the current owner’s lease contract.

318
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
 
 What liabilities, including those that may be hidden “off” the balance 
sheet, are you buying with a business? Limit liabilities, such as environ-
mental contaminations, through a contract. Conduct legal searches for 
liens, litigation, and tax problems.
 
 What does a background check turn up on the owners and key 
employees? Do they have good business experience, or do they have 
criminal records and a trail of unpaid debts?
Determining a business’s value
 
After you find what you think is a good business and do your homework, 
you’re ready to make an offer. Negotiating takes time and patience. Unless 
you’re legally savvy, find an attorney who focuses her practice on small-
business dealings. Have an attorney review and work with your contract. 
Also consider obtaining input from a qualified tax advisor.
Good advisors can help you inspect what you’re buying and look for red flags 
in the company’s financial statements. Advisors can also help structure the 
purchase to protect what you’re buying and to gain maximum tax benefits. If 
you work with a business broker, use an attorney and accountant as well.
 
The price that a business is listed for is often in excess of — and sometimes 
grossly so — the business’s true worth. Look at what similar businesses have 
sold for as a starting point for valuing a business that you want to buy. A 
smart homebuyer or real estate investor looks at comparable properties when 
he’s ready to make an offer.
 
When you look at sales of comparable businesses, figure the multiple of earn-
ings that these businesses sold for. In Chapter 5, I discuss how the price/
earnings ratio works for evaluating the value of larger, publicly traded companies. 
Because they’re less well established and riskier from an investment stand-
point, small, privately held businesses sell for a lower multiple of earnings 
than comparable, but larger, companies.
Some advisors and business brokers advocate using a multiple of revenue to 
determine the value of a business. Revenue is a poor proxy for profitability: 
Two businesses in the same field can have identical revenue yet quite 
different profitability because of how well they’re run, the pricing of their 
products and services, and the types of customers they attract.
In addition to looking at the sales price of other businesses relative to earn-
ings, you can also consider the value of a company’s assets. The so-called 
book value of a company’s assets is what the assets are worth per the compa-
ny’s balance sheet. Check these figures to ensure that their asset values are 
correct. Another, more conservative way to value such assets is to consider 
the liquidation/replacement cost.

319
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
Questioning profits
Don’t blindly take the profit from the bottom line 
of a business’s financial statement as the gospel. 
As part of your due diligence, ask a tax advisor 
to perform an audit after you negotiate a deal.
Even if the financial statements of a business 
are accurate, you (and your tax advisor) must 
still look for subtle problems that can make the 
profits of the business appear better than they 
truly are. The issues that I tell you to look for in 
Chapter 6, when you analyze the financial state-
ments of public companies that issue stock, also 
apply to evaluating the financial statements of 
small companies.
If necessary, factor out one-time events from 
the profit analysis. For example, if the business 
last year received an unusually large order that 
is unlikely to be repeated and hasn’t been the 
norm in the past, subtract this amount from the 
profitability analysis. Also, examine the owner’s 
salary to see if it’s low for the field. Owners can 
reduce their draw to a minimum or pay family 
members less than fair market salaries to pump 
up the profitability of their company in the years 
before they sell.
Also examine whether the rent or mortgage 
expense may change when you buy the 
business. Consider what will happen to profits 
when you factor in your expected rent or 
mortgage costs.

Resources

In this part . . .
E
verywhere you turn these days, you’re bombarded 
with investing tidbits, sound bites, trivia, advice, and 
opinions. In this important part, I help you evaluate the 
reliability of a given source. Whether you’re reading a mag-
azine or newspaper article or a book, perusing an Internet 
site, using software, watching television, or listening to the 
radio, you need to know how to evaluate what’s worth 
considering and what to ignore.

Chapter 16

In This Chapter
 Overcoming information and advice overload
 Evaluating investing resources
I
n the past, finding financial information was much simpler, largely because 
the available resources were limited. You could subscribe to publications 
such as Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine for general money issues and 
a local big-city newspaper for daily stock prices. The hard-core investor had 
The Wall Street Journal delivered daily.
Times have changed, though. Today’s investor faces information overload. 
Radio, television, magazines, newspapers, books, the Internet, family, friends, 
neighbors, and cabdrivers — everywhere you turn, someone is offering investing 
opinions, tips, and advice. You can’t pick up a newspaper or magazine or turn 
on the television or radio without bumping into articles, stories, segments, and 
entire programs devoted to investment issues.
Chosen wisely, the best investing resources can further your investment 
knowledge and enable you to make better decisions. Because investment 
information and advice is so widespread, and constantly growing, knowing 
how to sift through it is just as important as hearing what the best resources 
are today. Throughout the rest of the book, I name the best investment 
resources that I’m familiar with, but in this chapter, I explain how you can 
separate the good from the mediocre and awful.
Dealing with Information Overload
Early in the year 2000, one of my clients, Roseanne, called me in a near panic. 
“Eric, I’m not satisfied with my investments. Why are so many of my friends 
doubling and tripling their money in technology stocks, and my mutual funds are 
going nowhere? Everywhere I turn, people are talking about these high-growth 
companies. I want my piece of the pie, too!” I explained to her that many of 
her diversified mutual funds held some technology stocks as well as stocks in 

324
Par t V: Investing Resources 
many other industries. I also reminded her that because she was nearing 50 
years of age, she had a healthy helping of bonds in her portfolio as well.
She urged me to put her money in some technology stocks and technology-
focused funds, but I stood my ground. I further encouraged her to read 
this book (the second edition was out at the time), wherein I highlighted 
technology stocks as a bubble waiting to burst (see Chapter 5). I’m glad 
that Roseanne followed my advice, and now, years later, she is, too. During 
the severe stock market decline in the early 2000s, technology stocks got 
clobbered, but other market segments (such as bonds and value-oriented 
stocks) actually increased in value. (Even by the late 2000s, tech stocks were 
nowhere near attaining their prior levels — the NASDAQ index has been 
trading at half or less than the highs it reached in 2000.)
A major reason that so many people were talking about making money with 
technology stocks was that so many media outlets (radio, television, Web 
sites, and so on) were talking about these investments and other personal 
money management issues around the clock. Why is everybody in the media 
and publishing world putting out investing information? Has money become 
that much more complicated over the years? Are there simply more media 
and publishing executives who want to help us?
The following list explains some of the reasons why investing has become 
such a hot topic:
 
 Communications options are expanding. Over the past generation, the 
number of television channels has mushroomed as a result of cable tele-
vision. Flip through your cable channels at any hour of the day, and you 
see infomercials that promise to make you a real estate tycoon or stock 
market day trader in your spare time. The explosion of the Internet has 
introduced a whole new medium. Now, at a relatively low cost, anybody 
can publish a Web page.
 
 The accessibility of these communications mediums allows just about 
anyone with an animated personality and a few bucks to appear to be an 
expert. These newer communications options are primarily structured 
around selling advertising rather than offering quality content.
 
 Economic change breeds uncertainty. Global competition and technological 
advances are causing most industries to undergo dramatic changes in much 
shorter periods of time. Although jobs are relatively plentiful for many with 
particular training and skills, fear of job loss and financial instability run 
high. Economic change and widespread cynicism about Social Security’s 
ability to provide a reasonable retirement income to baby boomers has also 
caused many to seek investment guidance.
 
 Investment choices and responsibilities are increasing. More employees 
are forced to take responsibility for saving money for their retirement and 
deciding how to invest that money. In the past, more employers offered 
pension plans. In these plans, the employer set aside money on behalf of 
employees and retained a pension manager who decided how to invest 

325
 Chapter 16: Selecting Investing Resources
it. All the employees had to do was learn the level of benefits that they 
had earned and when they could begin drawing a monthly check.
 
 With today’s retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, employees need to edu-
cate themselves about how much money they need to save and how to 
invest it. In addition to mastering retirement planning and investment 
allocation, individuals face a dizzying number of financial products, such 
as the thousands of mutual funds that are on the market.
 
 Our society is too money focused. The pages of tabloid papers and 
magazines are filled with highly paid movie and sports celebrities and 
wealthy corporate executives. Other warning signs abound for a society 
that too often cares more about money than people and human relation-
ships. Some people view hiring someone else to raise their children as 
a luxury of wealth. Others spend tens of thousands of dollars on fancy, 
financed cars that require years of work to pay off. We don’t spend 
enough time with our children and then are puzzled why the teen suicide 
rate has tripled in the past two generations.
Read the next section to find out how you can filter out the best information 
and advice and skip the rest.
Separating Financial Fact from Fiction
Just because more sources offer investing advice doesn’t mean that you 
should read, listen to, or watch much of it. In this section, I offer prescrip-
tions for how to intelligently choose among all the available financial content.
Understanding how advertising corrupts
 
The first rule for maximizing your chances of finding the best investing infor-
mation and advice is to recognize that there are no free lunches. Too many 
people get sucked into supposedly free resources.
The Internet is packed with scores of “free” investing sites. Turn on your 
television or radio and you come across mountains of “free” stuff. Of course, 
someone is paying for all this “free” content, and it’s all there for some 
reason. Most of the free Internet sites are run by investment companies or 
someone else with something to sell. What these sites give away is nothing 
but subtle and not-so-subtle advertising for whatever products and services 
they sell. Advertising also foots the bill in the vast majority of cases involving 
free investment advice on TV and radio.

326
Par t V: Investing Resources 
As I discuss in Chapter 18, many investing and personal finance books aren’t 
free from subtly veiled advertising aims, either. Some authors choose to 
write books that are the equivalent of an infomercial for something else — 
such as high-priced seminars — that the “author” really wants to sell. Such 
writers aren’t interested in educating and helping you as much as they are 
seeking to sell you something. So, for example, an author might write about 
how complicated the investing markets are and some indicators he follows to 
time investments. However, at the end of such a book, the author might say 
that investing is too complicated to do on your own and that you really need 
a personal investment manager — which, to no great surprise, the author 
happens to be.
 
Whether in print or on the Internet, television, or radio — and whether it’s 
overt or subtle — advertising often compromises the quality of the investment 
advice it accompanies.
I won’t say that you can’t find some useful investment resources in medi-
ums with lots of advertising. You can find some good investing programs 
on radio and television and some helpful investing sites on the Internet. 
However, these resources are the exception to the rule that where there’s a 
lot of advertising, there’s little valuable information and advice. Likewise, just 
because magazines and newspapers have quite a bit of advertising doesn’t 
mean that some of their columnists and articles aren’t worthy of your time.
In the following sections, I outline the problems that advertising can cause 
within all the media outlets.
Influencing content
Many organizations, such as newspaper and magazine publishers and radio 
and television stations that accept ads, say that their ad departments are 
separate from their editorial departments. The truth, however, is that in most 
of these organizations, advertisers wield influence over the content. At a 
minimum, the editorial environment must be perceived as conducive to the 
sale of the advertiser’s product.
The stock market cable television channels, for example, carry many ads 
from brokers catering to investors who pick and trade their own stocks. 
Furthermore, such stations carry ads from firms that purport to teach you 
how to make big bucks day trading (see Chapter 5). Not surprisingly, such 
stations offer many “news” segments on their shows that cater to stock trad-
ers and condone and endorse foolish strategies, such as day trading, instead 
of condemning them. Instead of asking themselves what’s in the best inter-
ests of their viewers, listeners, and readers, executives at too many media 
and publishing firms ask what will attract attention and advertisers.

327
 Chapter 16: Selecting Investing Resources
Corrupting content
In most organizations, advertisers can have a direct and adulterating influence 
on editorial content. Specifically, some media organizations and publishers 
simply won’t say something negative about a major advertiser or will highlight 
and praise investment companies that are big advertisers.
More than a few publications have attempted to edit out critical comments 
that I’ve made about companies with lousy products that turned out to be 
advertisers in their publications. Some editors simply say that they don’t 
want to bite the hand that feeds them. Others are less candid about why they 
remove such criticism. The bottom line is still the same: Advertisers’ influ-
ence squashes freedom of speech and, more importantly, prevents readers, 
viewers, and listeners from getting the truth and best advice. (By the way, I 
don’t write for organizations that edit my work in such a fashion.)
Producing low-quality content
Because of the previously mentioned reasons and an overall lack of concern 
for the value of information and advice, some investing resources cut cor-
ners on the quality of their content. Because consumers often pay nothing or 
next to nothing for many investment resources, the media have an incentive 
to sell advertising space and not to hire high-quality writers who can offer 
sound advice to readers.
Recognizing quality resources
With the tremendous increase in the coverage of investing and other per-
sonal money issues, more and more journalists are writing about increas-
ingly technical issues — often in areas in which they have no expertise. 
(This is true in traditional print publications as well as in the so-called blogo-
sphere online.) Some of these writers provide good information and advice. 
Unfortunately, some dish out bad advice. In fields such as medicine or the 
law, you wouldn’t be so willing to take advice from non-experts. Why should 
you care any less about your money?
 
How can you know what’s good and whom you can trust? Although I can sug-
gest resources that I hold in high regard (and do so throughout this book, 
especially in Chapters 17, 18, and 19), I recognize that you may encounter 
many different investment resources and you need to understand how to 
tell the best from the rest. The answer to the question, dear reader, rests in 
educating thyself. The more knowledgeable you are about sound and flawed 
investment strategies, the better able you are to tell good from not-so-good 
investment resources.

328
Par t V: Investing Resources 
The best thing to do when you encounter a financial magazine, newspaper, 
Web site, or other resource for the first time is to investigate it. The following 
sections suggest some investigative work you should do before you take any-
one’s investment advice.
Following the money
All things being equal, you have a greater chance of finding quality content 
when subscriber fees account for the bulk of a company’s revenue and 
advertising accounts for little or none of the revenue. This generalization, of 
course, is just that — a generalization. Some publications that derive a rea-
sonable portion of their revenues from advertising have some good columns 
and content. Conversely, some relatively ad-free sources aren’t very good.
Figuring out their philosophy and agenda
Readers of my books can clearly understand my philosophies about invest-
ing. I advocate buying and holding, not trading and gambling. I explain how 
to build wealth through proven vehicles, including stocks, real estate, and 
small-business ownership. My guiding beliefs are clearly detailed on the 
Cheat Sheet in the front of this book.
 
Unfortunately, many publications and programs don’t make it as easy for you 
to see or hear their operating beliefs. You may have to do some homework. For 
example, with a radio program, you probably have to listen to at least portions 
of several shows to get a sense of the host’s investment philosophies. Warning 
signs include publications and programs that make investing sound overly 
complicated and that imply or say you won’t succeed or do as well if you don’t 
hire a financial advisor or follow your investments like a hawk.
Considering whether the information is constructive
Just about everywhere you turn these days — radio, television, and the Internet — 
you can get up-to-the-minute updates on financial markets around the globe. 
Although most investors have a natural curiosity about how their investments 
are doing, from my experience, the constant barrage of updates causes a loss 
of focus on the big picture. In many cases, publishing and media companies 
report what I call the “noise” rather than the news of the day. Some companies 
are far worse about doing so than others.
 
Over the next week, take a close look at how you spend your time keeping 
up with financial news and other information. Do the programs and publica-
tions that you most heavily use really help you better understand and map 
out sound investment strategies, or do they end up confusing, overwhelming, 
and paralyzing you with bits and pieces of contradictory and often hyped 
noise? I’m not saying that you should tune these resources out completely, 
but I am saying that you should devote less time to the noise of the day and 
more time to self-education. How can you do that? Read a few good books (a 
topic that I discuss in detail in Chapter 18).

329
 Chapter 16: Selecting Investing Resources
Considering their qualifications
Examine the backgrounds, including professional work experience and edu-
cation credentials, of a resource’s writers, hosts, and/or anchors. If such 
information isn’t given or easily found, that’s usually a red flag. People with 
something to hide, or a lack of something significantly redeeming to say 
about themselves, usually don’t promote their backgrounds.
 
Of course, just because someone seems to have a relatively impressive back-
ground doesn’t mean that she has your best interests in mind or has honestly 
presented her qualifications. For example, Forbes journalist William P. Barrett 
was skeptical of financial author Suze Orman’s biographical and business claims. 
He investigated and presented a sobering review of Orman’s stated credentials 
and qualifications in Forbes magazine — revealing that they were largely exagger-
ated. A writer for The San Francisco Chronicle later substantiated this fact.

A
ll the news that’s fit to print or broadcast — newspapers, magazines, 
newsletters, and radio and television programs inundate us with invest-
ing information and advice. In this chapter, I explain what to look for — and 
what to look out for — when you tune in to these media sources in the hopes 
of investing better.
In Print: Magazines and Newspapers
Visit a newsstand, and you find many investing publications as well as general 
interest publications with investing columns. I’ve written investing articles 
for various magazines and newspapers. Some of the experiences have been 
enjoyable, others okay, and a few miserable. The best publications and 
editors I’ve written for take seriously their responsibility to provide quality 
information and advice to their readers.
Taking the scribes to task
In this section, I discuss the problems with magazine and newspaper invest-
ment articles.

332
Par t V: Investing Resources 
Highlighting hype and horror
Whenever the stock market suffers a sharp decline, many in the media bring 
out the gloom and doom. Front-page headlines such as “The Beginning of 
the End” torment investors about holding on to their stocks. An avalanche of 
such articles, like that seen in late 2002 and early 2003, often coincides with 
a bottoming stock market. When the stock and real estate markets slid in the 
late 2000s, scores of “the sky is falling” pieces populated the pages.
Another particularly popular subject for such reporting is the cost of a college 
education. (See, you can write a sentence about the cost of education without 
including the word skyrocketing.) Scores of articles horrify parents with esti-
mates of the expected costs associated with sending Junior to campus. The typi-
cal advice: Start saving and investing early so you don’t have to tell Junior that 
you can’t afford to send him to college.
 
Cost-of-college stories typify another failing of the horror stories. The horror is 
the story, and the accompanying advice can be shortsighted. Completely over-
looked and ignored are the tax and financial aid consequences of the recom-
mended investment strategies. For example, if parents don’t take advantage of 
tax-deductible retirement accounts and instead save outside them, they not 
only pay more in taxes but also generally qualify for less financial aid. Sound 
investing decisions require a holistic approach that acknowledges that people 
have limited money and must make these sorts of trade-offs.
Offering poor advice
To sell their publications, magazines and newspapers sometimes entice read-
ers with promises of high returns. This can easily lead to crummy advice.
Consider the gaffe made by a Money magazine piece titled “Where to get safe, 
high yields.” The title itself should have been a red flag: It’s impossible to find 
a safe high yield. To get high yields, you must be willing to accept more risk. 
In the Money article, three of the recommended investments were limited 
partnerships (LPs) sold through commission-based brokers. These products’ 
high commissions and ongoing fees doomed even the luckiest of investors to 
mediocre or dismal investment returns.
The Money article even asserted that investors could earn annual returns as 
high as 18 percent on some LPs. Students of the financial markets know that 
the best ownership investments, such as stocks and real estate, return no 
more than 10 to 12 percent per year over the long haul. To expect more is to 
hold unrealistic expectations.
Quoting experts who are not
Historically, one way that journalists have attempted to overcome technical 
gaps in their knowledge is to interview and quote financial experts. Although 
this may add to the accuracy and quality of a story, journalists who aren’t 

333
 Chapter 17: Perusing Periodicals, Radio, and Television
experts themselves have difficulty telling qualified experts from hacks. (See 
Chapter 16 for a discussion on examining the qualifications of writers who 
offer up financial guidance.)
 
One glaring example of this phenomenon that continues to amaze me is how 
many newspaper and magazine financial writers quote unproven advice 
from investment newsletter writers. As I discuss in the section “Investment 
Newsletters,” later in this chapter, the predictive advice of many newsletter 
writers is often wrong and causes investors to earn lower returns and missed 
investment gains due to frequent trading than if they simply bought and held. 
Journalists who simply parrot this type of information and provide an endorse-
ment that unqualified sources are “experts” do readers an immense disservice.
Focusing on noise and minutiae
Daily financial press writers also contribute to today’s shortsighted investment 
environment and encourage readers to adopt similarly misguided outlooks. It’s 
common for daily newspaper charts to show the stock market’s movements at 
five-minute intervals throughout the previous day. This focus on the noise of 
the day causes nervous investors to make panicked, emotionally based deci-
sions, such as deciding to sell after major stock market falls.
Of course, the daily print media aren’t the only ones chronicling the minutiae. 
As I discuss elsewhere, other media, including television, radio, and the Internet, 
cause many investors to lose sight of the long term and the big picture.
 
The short length of newspaper and magazine articles can easily lead writers to 
oversimplify complex issues and offer flawed advice. For example, some pieces 
on mutual funds focus on a fund’s returns and investment philosophies, devot-
ing little, if any, space to the risks or tax consequences of investing in 
recommended funds.
Making the most of periodicals
 
So what should you do if you want to find out more about investing but don’t 
want to be overloaded with information? Educate yourself and be selective. If 
you’re considering subscribing to financial publications, go to the library first 
and review some old issues. Was the information and advice useful and error 
free? The more you know, the easier it is to separate the wheat from the chaff.
Shy away from publications that purport to be able to predict the future — 
few people can, and those who can are usually busy managing money. 
Unfortunately, as the financial markets got more volatile in the late 1990s 
and early 2000s, and then again in the late 2000s, I witnessed more and more 
publications promoting columnists and headlines that attempted to prognos-
ticate the future.

334
Par t V: Investing Resources 
 
Read bylines and biographies and get to know writers’ strengths and weak-
nesses. Ditto for the entire publication. Any writer or publisher can make mis-
takes. Some make many more than others — follow their advice at your own 
peril. Start by evaluating advice in the areas that you know the most about. 
For example, if you’re interested in investing in Microsoft or Intel and are rea-
sonably familiar with the computer industry, find out what the publications 
say about technology investments.
And remember that you’re not going to outfox the financial markets, because 
they’re reasonably efficient (see Chapter 4). Spend your time seeking out infor-
mation and advice that help you flesh out your goals and develop a plan rather 
than trolling for the next hot stock tip or worrying about short-term trends.
Radio and Television Programs
As you move from the world of magazines and newspapers to radio and tele-
vision, the entertainment component usually increases. In this section, I high-
light some common problems with radio and television programs and offer 
some recommendations for the better programs.
Looking at problems with radio 
and television programs
I’ve been a guest on hundreds of radio and television programs. Just as 
Dorothy discovered in The Wizard of Oz, seeing how things work behind the 
scenes tends to deglamorize these mediums. Here are the main problems I’ve 
discovered from my years observing radio and television.
You often get what you pay for
Some of the worst financial advice is brought to you, not surprisingly, for “free.” 
Nationally, thousands of radio stations have financial and money talk shows. 
Money and investing shows are proliferating on television cable channels. 
Because listeners don’t pay for these shows, advertising often drives who and 
what gets on the air, as I discuss in Chapter 16. But I’ve found that some of the 
worst offenders are local — and even national — radio advice programs.
Some of these shows are “hosted” by a person who is nothing more than a 
financial salesperson. That person’s first, and sometimes only, motivation for 
wanting to do the show is to pick up clients. Many local radio investing pro-
grams are hosted by a local stockbroker (who usually calls himself a financial 
consultant or planner). A broker who reels in just one big fish a month — a 
person with, say, $300,000 to invest — can generate commissions totaling 
$15,000 by selling investments with a 5 percent commission.

335
 Chapter 17: Perusing Periodicals, Radio, and Television
But radio suffers from more than brokers trolling for new clients, as evi-
denced by the case of Sonny Bloch, a New York radio personality who was 
indicted for fraud. The Securities and Exchange Commission found that Bloch 
was receiving kickbacks from investment brokers for endorsing some pretty 
crummy investment products on his nationally syndicated radio show. The 
SEC also filed a complaint against Bloch for defrauding investors of millions 
of dollars to supposedly purchase some radio stations. Instead, according 
to the SEC, Bloch and his wife used hundreds of thousands of dollars to pur-
chase a condominium. Partners in a precious metals firm (DeAngelis Brothers 
Collectibles) that Bloch regularly endorsed on the air were arrested for theft 
and ended up in bankruptcy.
 
I know from personal experience what too many radio stations look for in the 
way of hosts for financial programs. The host’s integrity, knowledge, and lack 
of conflict of interest don’t matter. Willingness to work for next to nothing 
helps: One radio station program director told me that she liked the broker 
who was hosting a financial talk show because the broker was willing to work 
for so little compensation from the radio station. Never mind the fact that the 
broker rarely gave useful advice and was obviously trolling for new clients. 
That didn’t matter to the program director, who told me, “We’re in the enter-
tainment business.”
Information and hype overload
At 9:30 a.m. EST the New York Stock Exchange opens, and transactions start 
streaming across the bottom of television screens tuned to financial cable 
stations. Changes in the major market indexes — the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ index — also flash on the screen. In 
fact, these indexes are updated almost every five seconds on the screen. Far 
more exciting than a political race or sporting event, this event never ends 
and offers constant change and excitement. Even after the markets close, 
reporting of still-open overseas markets continues. The performance of 
futures of U.S. stock market indexes then appears on screen.
 
All of this reporting and data don’t make us better investors. Although the 
conventionally accepted notion is that this information overload levels the 
playing field for the individual investor, I know too many investors who make 
emotionally based decisions prodded by all this noise, prognostication, opin-
ion, and hearsay.
Poor method of guest selection
Some journalists, often in an effort to overcome their own lack of knowledge, 
like to interview “experts.” A classic example of this problem is the media 
exposure that author Charles Givens used to receive. Givens became a darling 
of the media and the public following unprecedented, consecutive three-day 
appearances on NBC’s Today show.

336
Par t V: Investing Resources 
“When Charles Givens talks, everyone listens,” said Jane Pauley, then co-host 
of the Today show. Bryant Gumbel, the other co-host, said of Givens, “Last 
time he was here, the studio came to a complete stop. . . . Everyone started 
taking notes, and I was asking for advice.” Givens regularly held court on the 
talk show circuit with the likes of Larry King and Oprah Winfrey.
The Givens case highlights some of the media’s inability to distinguish between 
good and bad experts. It’s relatively easy for the financially sophisticated to 
see the dangerous, oversimplified, and biased advice that Givens offers in his 
books. In his first best-seller, Wealth Without Risk, Givens recommended invest-
ing in limited partnerships and provided a phone number and address of a 
firm, Delta Capital Corp. in Florida, where readers could buy the partnerships. 
Those who bought these products ended up paying hefty sales commissions 
and owning investments worth half or less of their original value. Besides the 
problematic partnerships he recommended, court proceedings against Givens 
in a number of states uncovered that he owned a major share of Delta Capital.
 
Other investing advice from Givens that gives pause: In his chapters on invest-
ing, he said that the average yearly return you’ll earn investing in mutual funds 
will be 25 percent or 30 percent. The reality: An investor would be fortunate to 
earn half of these inflated returns.
So how did Givens get on all these national programs? He had a shrewd 
publicist, and the show producers either didn’t read his books and/or were 
themselves financially illiterate. Talk shows and many reporters often don’t 
take the time to check out people like Givens. Most of the time, the books 
are never read. Producers, who themselves usually don’t know much about 
investing, often decide to put someone on the air on the basis of a press kit 
or a call from a publicist.
Picking the best investing programs
 
Even though I warn you about problems associated with radio and television 
investing advice, you can find some good programs and hosts among the bad 
apples. The following are my picks for the best of the lot:
 
 Money Talk: Bob Brinker’s ABC radio program airs weekend afternoons 
in most parts of the country. Brinker is an advocate of investing in mutual 
funds. The one area where Brinker and I disagree is that he does advocate 
market timing — he puts out a newsletter called MarketTimer, whose invest-
ment picks haven’t performed as well as the market averages over the long 
term. That said, Brinker does help listeners stay focused on the big picture 
and headed in generally the right direction.

337
 Chapter 17: Perusing Periodicals, Radio, and Television
 
 Kudlow & Company: Conservative economist Larry Kudlow hosts one 
of the few shows on CNBC worth watching. Liberals may be turned off 
by Kudlow’s politics, but the show features guests who present a bal-
ance of viewpoints when Kudlow delves in to political issues. Kudlow’s 
long-term optimism can help skittish investors keep their wits when so 
many are losing theirs!
Investment Newsletters
Particularly in the newsletter business, prognosticators fill your mailbox with 
promotional material making outrageous claims about their returns. Private 
money managers, not subject to the same scrutiny and auditing requirements 
as mutual funds, can do the same.
 
Be especially wary of any newsletters making claims of high returns. Stephen 
Leeb’s Personal Finance newsletter, for example, claims that he has developed 
a brilliant proprietary model, which he calls the “Master Key Indicator.” His 
model supposedly has predicted the last 28 upturns in the market in a row 
without a single miss. The odds of doing this, according to Leeb, are more 
than 268 million to 1! The ad goes on to claim that Leeb’s “Master Key” market-
timing system could have turned a $10,000 investment over 12 years into $39.1 
million, a return of 390,000 percent!
Turns out that this outrageous claim was based on backtesting, looking back 
over historic returns and creating “what if” scenarios. In other words, Leeb 
didn’t turn anyone’s $10,000 into $39 million. Much too late after that ad 
appeared, the SEC finally charged Leeb with false advertising. Leeb settled 
out of court for a mere $60,000 fine (far less than he cost investors).
According to the Hulbert Financial Digest, the worst investment newsletters 
have underperformed the market averages by dozens of percentage points; 
some would even have caused you to lose money during a decade when 
the financial markets performed extraordinarily well. Newsletter purveyor 
Joe Granville, for example, has long been known for making outrageous and 
extreme stock market predictions and is often quoted in financial publica-
tions. He claims to have the number-one-rated newsletter — omitting to men-
tion that it was number one for one year only (in 1989). Over the subsequent 
decade — one of the best decades ever for the stock market (with U.S. stocks 
more than quadrupling in value) — followers of Granville’s advice lost 99 
percent of their investments!

338
Par t V: Investing Resources 
 
Be highly suspicious of past investment performance claims made by investment 
newsletters. Don’t believe a track record unless a reputable accounting firm 
with experience doing such audits has audited it. In order for you to make sound 
investing choices, you don’t need predictions and soothsayers. If you choose to 
follow these and you’re lucky, little harm will be done. But more often than not, 
you can lose lots of money by following their predictions. Stay far away from 
publications that purport to be able to tell what’s going to happen next. No 
one has a crystal ball.

In This Chapter
 Recognizing that some books advertise more than they educate
 Being skeptical about authors’ claimed returns
 Presenting my favorite investing books
O
ver the years, I’ve read hundreds of investing and financial books. I 
hope you haven’t subjected yourself to this task!
 
Although most books have something to offer, too many investing books are 
burdened with biased, wrongheaded advice and misinformation. As a non-
expert, you may have a hard time sifting through the heap for the tidbits of 
treasure. The bad stuff can pollute your otherwise intelligent thinking and 
cause you to make investing mistakes that millions before you have made.
I hope that I’m not the first person to tell you not to believe everything you 
read. Publishing is no different from any other business — companies are in 
it to make money. As with other industries, the shortsighted desire to reap 
quick profits causes some companies to publish content that seems attrac-
tive in the short term but is toxic to readers in the long term. In this chapter, 
I help you sift through the confusion to find books worth reading.
Beware of Infomercial Books
 
The worst books tend to confuse more than they convey. Why would an 
author want to do that? Well, some authors have an incentive to make things 
complicated and mysterious. Their agenda may be to sell you a high-priced 
newsletter or persuade you to turn your money over to them to manage.

340
Par t V: Investing Resources 
One book “author” said to me, “Royalties, schmoyalties . . . I write books to 
hook people into my monthly newsletter. I can make $185 per year off of a $195 
newsletter sale. You can’t do that with a book.” You sure can’t. However, this 
salesman isn’t satisfied to just turn out books that are short on information 
and advice but long on pitches to keep up with the latest market developments 
through his newsletter. When you subscribe to his newsletter, you’re told that 
the financial markets are so complicated and change so rapidly that the news-
letter is really no substitute for using his money-management service!
 
The worst books steer you toward purchasing a crummy investment product 
that the author has a vested interest in selling you. Unfortunately, most publish-
ers don’t do their homework to check out prospective authors. They don’t care 
what the author is up to, or whether the author is really an expert on the topic, 
as long as she’s willing and able to write and promote a salable book. Authors 
who run around the country conducting seminars and making publicity appear-
ances are a plus to the publisher.
In his books and seminar promotional materials, Wade Cook claimed to be 
able to teach people how to earn monthly returns of 20 percent or more (that’s 
right — monthly, not yearly) by using his stock market investing strategies.
Cook’s self-published best-selling books were short on specifics and were largely 
infomercials for his high-priced seminars. Cook’s get-rich-quick investment semi-
nars — which cost a whopping $4,695 — had been so successful at attracting 
attendees that Cook’s company, Profit Financial Corporation, went public and 
generated more than $100 million in revenues annually! Cook wasn’t shy about 
promising people they could get rich quick without much effort. Here’s a 
passage from his book Stock Market Miracles:
I want millions of dollars and I don’t want to have to work a 9 to 5 job to 
get them. Boy, that’s a conundrum. It’s almost impossible to work a typical 
American job, with average income and accumulate millions. Yes, in 40 to 
50 years maybe, but who wants to wait that long? That’s the rub — accom-
plishing the task of having millions without having to work for millions.
You see my method is simple. I want to use a small amount of money — 
risk capital if you will — to generate cash flow which will exponentially 
generate more income.
Cook promised his followers several hundred percent annualized returns by 
teaching them how to successfully gamble (not invest) in the stock market. 
Cook’s “techniques” included trading in and out of stocks and options on 
stocks after short holding periods of weeks, days, or even hours.
Cook’s trading strategies were loosely based upon technical analysis — that is, 
examining a stock’s price movements and volume history through charting. 
(See Chapter 6 for more details on the foolishness of technical analysis.) Cook’s 

341
 Chapter 18: Selecting the Best Investment Books
investment seminar, which was offered in cities throughout the country, was 
marketed to folks like this: “If you aren’t getting 20 percent per month, or 300 
percent annualized returns on your investments, you need to be there.”
Steven Thomas, a truck driver, went to a seminar with his wife so both of 
them could follow and implement Cook’s strategies. In addition to spending 
$4,695 on the seminar, they also spent another $2,000 on audiotapes and 
videotapes. Six months later, Steven spent $1,500 on a paging system from 
Cook’s company. The results: Thomas eventually lost $36,000 on investments 
made following Cook’s strategies, which he borrowed against his home’s 
equity. “I saw this as an opportunity to quit my job and just invest in the 
stock market,” says Thomas. “This has had a terrible impact on my family, 
and I’m super-depressed.”
Of course, if Cook had indeed earned the 300 percent annual returns his 
seminars claimed to be able to teach the masses how to achieve, he would 
have, in about a decade, become the world’s wealthiest individual if he had 
invested just $1 million of the income he supposedly earned in real estate. 
Look out, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett! Any investor starting with just 
$10,000 would vault to the top of the list of the world’s wealthiest people in 
about 15 years if Cook’s teachings really worked!
So how did Cook get his start in the investing world? Here’s what his Web 
site said:
He was a taxicab driver in the ’70s. Borrowing $500 from his father, Wade 
Cook started buying real estate. His innovative ideas and gutsy follow-
through enabled him to turn that $500 into several million. But that’s 
nothing compared with what he’s doing on Wall Street. Starting with 
$1,300, using his “Rolling Rock” and “Range Rider” methods, he’s showing 
students how to create millions.
Why is Wade so smart? He says he’s “street smart.” What he discovered 
driving a cab changed his life forever. While his fellow cabbies were out 
looking for the big runs, Wade was taking every little run he could find — $4 
here, $5 here. You see it costs $2 just to get into a cab (something called 
a meter drop) even if you only go two blocks. At the end of a month, 
Wade made three times what every other taxicab driver made. Now, 
Wade applies his “meter drop” technique to his stock market investment 
business — making a ton of money on a lot of little deals.
Although Cook’s investment return expectations were completely unrealistic, 
he got away with claiming hyped and undocumented returns for many years 
because he didn’t manage money for others. Seminar promoters and newslet-
ter writers face no SEC scrutiny of their inflated performance claims or what 

342
Par t V: Investing Resources 
they do in their seminars as long as no securities laws are violated. The SEC 
refers to such organizations as nonregulated entities.
Of course, Cook wasn’t the first person to profit in this fashion. Numerous other 
seminar promoters and authors (some are discussed later in this chapter) 
have made big bucks as well, including the Beardstown investment club, which 
couldn’t document its supposedly market-beating returns of 23-plus percent per 
year (see the next section for details). In addition to puffed-up expected stock 
market returns, there’s more to Cook’s past than simply driving a taxi. According 
to Smart Money magazine, Cook’s dubious business practices had him in trouble 
throughout the ’80s. At the end of his real estate seminars, which touted that 
average people could become millionaires by buying property with little money 
down, Cook began peddling stock in his own business ventures.
By 1990, state securities regulators in six states — Missouri, Utah, Minnesota, 
Illinois, Oregon, and Arizona — issued Cook cease-and-desist orders for selling 
securities without a license, selling unregistered securities, and omitting 
material facts — like the fact that he had declared bankruptcy in 1987. In fact, 
Arizona charged that Cook had duped $390,841 out of 150 investors by selling 
unregistered securities, funneling $48,000 of that money into a Scottsdale 
home purchase and federal income tax payments. The state ordered him to 
pay back the money and slapped him with a $150,000 penalty.
Cook answered by filing bankruptcy (again). Cook then moved back to his 
home state of Washington, where he didn’t lay low for long. His new company, 
Profit Financial Corporation, became wildly successful by selling his Wall 
Street Workshop seminars and publishing his two stock-picking books. The 
attorneys general of several states sought millions of dollars in consumer 
refunds and sued the company. The states alleged the company lied about its 
investment track record. (Now that’s a big surprise — this company claimed 
you would make 300 percent per year in stocks!) Cook’s company settled 
the blizzard of state and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuits against 
his firm by agreeing to accurately disclose its trading record in future pro-
motions and to give refunds to customers who were misled by past inflated 
return claims.
Although Profit Financial Corporation was a public company, SEC documents 
indicated that it wasn’t exactly shareholder friendly. Cook set up a rather 
clever business structure whereby the public company (of which he is the 
majority owner) was required to pay him for the right to print his words and 
teach his methods. This enabled Cook to funnel much of the revenue stream 
directly into his pockets before it ever got to the shareholders. According to 
SEC filings, Cook’s total corporate compensation in one year exceeded $8 mil-
lion! According to a report by Bloomberg News, Cook’s firm lost a whopping 
89 percent of its own money trading in 2000. As Deb Bortner, director of the 
Washington State Securities Division and president of the North American 

343
 Chapter 18: Selecting the Best Investment Books
Securities Administrators Association, observed, “Either Wade is unable to 
follow his own system, which he claims is simple to follow, or the system 
doesn’t work.”
And if there weren’t enough unsavory aspects to Cook’s financial dealings, 
Cook was sentenced in 2007 to more than seven years in federal prison for 
tax evasion, filing false tax returns, and obstructing a tax investigation, and 
was ordered to pay nearly $4 million in additional taxes.
 
The moral of the story: Be highly skeptical and suspicious of investing books that 
direct you to high-priced seminars and other expensive products and services 
from the author. The best investing books, which I recommend later in this 
chapter, seek to instruct and educate.
Ignore Unaudited Performance Claims
 
Book authors avoid careful scrutiny of claims of especially high returns. But if 
a performance claim hasn’t been independently audited, don’t believe it.
Remember also that the stock market, over the long term, provides annual-
ized returns of about 10 percent. View skeptically any prognosticator or 
author claiming substantially higher returns that sound too good to be true.
Some book publishers are happy to look the other way or even to solicit and 
encourage great boasts that they use in the packaging to sell books. Consider 
these two examples: The Beardstown Ladies’ Common-Sense Investment Guide: 
How We Beat the Stock Market — and How You Can, Too and The Whiz Kid of 
Wall Street’s Investment Guide by Matt Seto.
The Beardstown investment club claimed a whopping 23.4 percent annual 
return since the club’s inception in 1983. In the book, the authors advocated 
forming an investment club, pooling your money, and using a simple stock 
selection method to beat the pants off the market and the suspendered man-
agers of mutual funds. The bulk of this book walked readers through how this 
investment club evaluated and selected individual stocks.
Seto’s book boasted, “Matt Seto manages a portfolio that consistently outper-
forms 99 percent of all mutual fund managers . . . and returns an annual aver-
age of 34 percent.” In his book, this 17-year-old investing genius told readers 
to forget bonds, real estate, and mutual funds and grow rich by investing 
entirely in individual stocks.

344
Par t V: Investing Resources 
 
Each of these books made prominently displayed and marketed performance 
claims. The Beardstown club’s returns and Seto’s returns, versus the market 
averages, would’ve placed them shoulder to shoulder with the legendary 
Peter Lynch, of the now famous Fidelity Magellan fund, and Warren Buffett, an 
investor whom Peter Lynch described as “the Greatest Investor of them all.” 
Problem is, neither book contained information as to how these investment 
gurus calculated their returns, nor were the authors able to substantiate their 
claimed returns when asked to.
When I first wrote about the Beardstown book for The San Francisco 
Examiner, I offered to work with an accounting firm to calculate the club’s 
returns if the club supplied the necessary information. I asked the same of 
Seto when I read his book. Neither of these authors could supply the docu-
mentation to prove their claims, and they backpedaled when pressed.
Initially, the Beardstown club said it would send the information, but months 
passed, and it never arrived. The club’s media spokesperson then told me 
that the club has “chosen not to make our return an issue. . . . we’re not out 
to be bragging.” This statement was surprising, given the claims prominently 
plastered all over the book.
A later piece in Chicago magazine proved that although the Beardstown 
investment club claimed 23 percent per year returns versus 14 percent for 
the market, the club actually tremendously underperformed the market 
and earned only 9 percent per year. The publisher of the Beardstown book, 
Buena Vista Publishing (which was doing business as Hyperion and Seth 
Godin Productions), was ultimately sued. The book publisher settled the 
lawsuit in 2002. Under the terms of the settlement, buyers of the Beardstown 
investment club’s books, audiotapes, or videotapes received certificates that 
could be redeemed for other books published by Hyperion.
Do you think the Beardstown ladies would have gotten their book deal 
(and landed on best-seller lists) if the facts had been known? Seto, likewise, 
couldn’t prove his claim of an astounding 34 percent return.
Investing Books Worth Reading
Exceptional investing books — ones that are readable, educational, and 
insightful — are rare. Some of the better investment books are technical in 
nature and are written by career investment folks, so don’t be surprised if 
they require more than one read. Make the investment of time; it’ll pay big 
dividends (and capital gains!). Following are my picks for books that are 
worth the trouble of tracking down and reading.

A Random Walk Down Wall Street
 
Now in its ninth edition, A Random Walk Down Wall Street (Norton), by 
Burton Malkiel, is a classic that was first published in 1973. Malkiel is an 
entertaining and intelligent writer. Drawing from examples from this century 
and others, Malkiel teaches how speculative bubbles (frenzied buying) and 
fear and greed, as well as economic and corporate fundamentals, can move 
the financial markets.
One fundamental premise of his book is that the financial markets can’t be 
predicted, especially in the short term. Common sense confirms this prem-
ise: If someone could figure out a system to forecast the markets and make 
a fortune, then that person wouldn’t waste time writing a book, publishing a 
newsletter, and so on. Malkiel, in fact, is one of the pioneers and proponents 
of index mutual funds, which simply invest in a relatively fixed basket of secu-
rities in order to track the overall market performance rather than to attempt 
to beat it. (See Chapter 8 to find out about index funds and how to use them.)
Needless to say, many Wall Street types aren’t enamored of this book. As 
Malkiel says, the very term random walk is considered an “obscenity.” But 
Malkiel presents a mountain of compelling arguments and data to support his 
case that most Wall Street firms and their investment research aren’t worthy 
of an investor’s hard-earned money. He also convincingly rebukes the whole 
field of technical analysis, which purports to be able to predict security 
prices based on charting and following past price movements. (See Chapter 6 
for more about technical analysis.)
Malkiel explains how to look at some common-sense indicators, such as 
whether the stock and bond markets are fairly valued and your own personal 
goals and desire to take risk, to develop a thoughtful and successful invest-
ment plan. Instead of trying to predict the future, Malkiel explains how the 
level of risk an investor accepts with investments will ultimately determine 
future returns.
Stocks for the Long Run
 
Finance professor Jeremy J. Siegel loves investing data, especially examin-
ing it over long time periods. In Stocks for the Long Run: The Definitive Guide 
to Financial Market Returns and Long-Term Investment Strategies, 4th Edition 
(McGraw-Hill), Siegel presents an analysis of U.S. stock and bond returns 
since 1802! The book is packed with charts and graphs, some of which you 
won’t readily comprehend unless you’re the analytic, graphical sort. Even so, 
Siegel provides comprehensive discussion of the worldwide financial markets 
as well as how the economic environment affects stocks. The book focuses 
on stock market investing, although it also discusses bonds if for no other 
reason than to compare their returns and risk to stocks.

Built to Last and Good to Great
 
Some people may think that Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies 
(HarperCollins) is just for the small number of people who want to build a large 
company. However, the book, written by management consultant James Collins 
and Stanford Business School Professor Jerry Porras, is an excellent book for all 
entrepreneurs and people who work in leadership positions in companies, as 
well as people interested in investing in individual stocks. Rarely does a great 
book make it to the business best-seller lists, but Built to Last did.
The book presents the findings from an extensive six years’ worth of 
research into what’s behind the success of companies such as 3M, Boeing, 
Ford, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Sony, and Wal-Mart, all of which have 
achieved great success in their respective industries over many years. The 
average company in the Collins and Porras study was founded in 1897. In 
all, the authors tracked 18 extraordinary companies (referred to as the gold-
medal winners in their respective industries) and compared the traits of 
these companies with those of similarly long-lived but less successful peer 
companies (in the same industries).
Collins and Porras’s findings not only yield insight into how to build or iden-
tify a great business in which to invest but also destroy some commonly 
held myths. For example, some people feel that a great idea is behind every 
great company. This concept is wrong, and in fact, according to the authors’ 
research, companies founded on the basis of a great idea can lead to focusing 
on the idea rather than laying the groundwork for building a great company. 
Sony’s founder, for example, wrote a nine-page philosophical prospectus 
setting the stage for this great company, yet he had few product ideas in his 
firm’s early days. Early products, such as a rice cooker, failed miserably.
 
Great, visionary companies are rigid and unyielding when it comes to respect-
ing their core ideologies and principles. On the other hand, such companies 
tinker and experiment to stimulate positive change and innovation. And 
despite their often-stunning financial success, great companies usually have 
an aspiration higher than or equal to maximizing profits: fulfilling a purpose 
and being driven by values. This book is packed with insights, information, 
and examples, so don’t expect to absorb all of its contents in one reading.
Collins subsequently wrote another outstanding book, Good to Great: Why 
Some Companies Make the Leap . . . And Others Don’t (HarperCollins), which 
he calls the prequel to Built to Last. In Good to Great, Collins presents the 
engaging and insightful results of another long-term study of numerous com-
panies that over time moved from being average companies to outstanding 
companies. As with Built to Last, this newer book can assist readers not only 
with managing their own small businesses but also with selecting companies 
to invest in.

Mutual Funds For Dummies
Okay, I’m a tad biased about Mutual Funds For Dummies (Wiley), which I

Investigating Internet and 
Software Resources
In This Chapter
 Choosing investing software
 Recognizing Internet pitfalls and opportunities
 Finding the best investing Web sites
T
housands of investing software packages and Web sites claim to enable 
you to more easily make profitable investments. As with most other 
advertising claims, the reality of using your computer for investing and other 
tasks falls short of the promises and the hype.
 
In this chapter, I show you ways that your computer may help you with your 
investing challenges and chores. Throughout this discussion, however, please 
remember several important caveats:
 
 Some highly successful investors don’t use their computers (or they use 
them infrequently) to deal with their investments.
 
 You may subject yourself to information overload and spend a fair amount 
of money without seeing many benefits if you don’t choose wisely.
 
 Don’t believe everything you read, especially in the online world, where 
filters and editors are often absent. (Of course, as I discuss elsewhere in 
this book, filters and editors don’t guarantee that you’ll find quality invest-
ment advice and information when you read financial publications.)
Evaluating Investment Software
Good investment software should be user-friendly and provide quality infor-
mation for making sound decisions. Software that helps you make personal 
investment decisions also needs to provide, if applicable, well-founded advice.

350
Par t V: Investing Resources 
 
Which software is best for you depends on what you’re trying to accomplish, 
as well as your level of investment knowledge and computer savvy. Software 
can help you with a variety of investment tasks, from tracking your invest-
ments to researching, planning, and placing trades through your computer (a 
topic that I discuss in Chapter 9). The following sections help you find the best 
software for your needs.
Investment tracking software
Software that can help you with investment tracking falls into one of two 
main groups:
 
 Personal finance software that also includes investment-tracking 
capabilities
 
 Software that focuses exclusively on investment tracking
 
The broader personal finance packages such as Quicken and Microsoft Money 
are more user-friendly and are probably more familiar if you already use these 
packages’ other features (such as a bill-paying feature).
In the following sections, I outline what I see as the advantages and disadvan-
tages of using tracking software based on your needs and offer a few alterna-
tive approaches to tracking your investments.
The benefits
Investment tracking software offers a number of positive features that may 
appeal to you:
 
 Organization: One of the best benefits of these packages is that using 
them can help you get organized. If you enter your investments into the 
program, the software can help you make sure that you don’t lose track 
of your holdings. The fact that investors lose billions of dollars annually 
to escheatment — a situation in which financial institutions turn money 
over to the state because the owner loses track of his investment (often 
because the investor moved or passed away) — is testimony to the 
disarray of some investors’ tracking systems. Of course, if your home 
burns to the ground and you don’t have a backup copy of your files or 
software off-site, you have to start your documentation from scratch.
 
 At-a-glance access: In addition to organizing all of your investment 
information in one place, investment software allows you to track origi-
nal purchase price, current market values, and rates of return on your 
investments. If you have accounts at numerous investment firms, using 
software can reduce some of the complications involved in tracking your 
investing kingdom.

351
 Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
 
 Overall return data: People usually know their CD and bond yields, but 
ask most people investing in individual stocks and bonds what the total 
return was on their entire portfolio, and at best, you’ll get a guess. It’s 
the rare person who can quote you total returns or tell you whether her 
returns are on pace to reach her future financial goals. If someone does 
know her investments’ returns, she probably doesn’t know whether that 
return is good, bad, or otherwise. Feel good having made 22 percent 
on your portfolio of stocks last year? Maybe you wouldn’t if an index of 
comparable stocks was up 35 percent over the same period.
 
 Investment tracking software can be more useful for stock traders. In my 
experience, stock traders, the people who would most benefit from using 
these programs, often don’t track their overall returns. If they did, they 
could calculate the benefit (or lack thereof) of all their trading. (I’ve never 
worked with a stock picker who completed this exercise with me and had 
return numbers that beat the market indexes over the long term.)
The drawbacks
Many software makers produce programs that claim to solve investment-
tracking quandaries. (Numerous financial Web sites offer tracking tools as 
well.) However, investment tracking software isn’t a painless panacea for 
investors who want to track their investments and returns.
Many people buy these programs thinking that the programs will, after a 
small investment of time, simplify their investment lives. My review of many 
investment-tracking packages suggests that you should be prepared to make 
a substantial time commitment to find out how to use these packages and 
should know that other, less high-tech alternatives may be more efficient and 
enlightening. Also know that a good portion of program users tire of entering 
all the required data and then feel guilty for falling behind.
If you want to see what your investment returns have been over the years, 
be aware that entering historic data from your account statements (if you 
can find them) is a time-consuming process, regardless of which package you 
use. To calculate your returns, you generally need to enter each new invest-
ment that you make as well as all your reinvestments of dividends, interest, 
and capital gains distributions (such as those made on mutual funds). Ugh!
The alternatives
 
If you’re not into data entry, here are some alternative routes to consider:
 
 Organization: Keeping a current copy of each of your investment state-
ments in a binder or file folder can accomplish the same result of 
organizing all of your holdings.
 
 At-a-glance access: Investment software can track all the facts and figures 
for all of your investments — purchase price, market value, rates of return, 
and so on. But you can accomplish the same things by consolidating your 

352
Par t V: Investing Resources 
investments at one investment company. (See my discussion of discount 
brokers in Chapter 9.)
 
 Overall return data: You can easily estimate the return of your overall 
portfolio by using an old-fashioned paper and pencil. Simply weight the 
return of each investment by the portion of your portfolio that’s invested 
in it. For example, with a simple portfolio equally divided between two 
investments that returned 10 percent and 20 percent respectively, your 
overall portfolio return would be 15 percent (10 × .50 + 20 × .50 = 15). If 
you’re not adding to or taking money from a portfolio, you can simply 
compare the portfolio’s value at year end to the prior year end.
Understanding how software calculates returns
Most software programs calculate returns in 
one of two ways. First, the programs can cal-
culate your effective or “internal” rate of return 
(IRR) by comparing your original amounts 
invested to the current market value. Of those 
programs that I’ve tested that calculate IRR — 
and some don’t — the results were accurate. 
After you calculate your returns, knowing how 
they compare with relevant market averages 
would be nice. Unfortunately, not all programs 
allow you to compare your performance to vari-
ous market indexes.
The tax or cost-basis method is the second 
way software may calculate your returns. All 
the packages that I’ve reviewed calculate your 
cost basis for accounting purposes. Your cost 
basis is your original investment plus reinvested 
dividends and capital gains, for which you have 
already paid taxes in a non-retirement account. 
To get an accurate cost basis, you need to key 
in all of your investments, including reinvested 
distributions. Time-starved investors can take 
solace in the fact that most investment compa-
nies, particularly larger mutual fund providers, 
provide cost basis information for you upon 
request or when you sell an investment.
Some packages provide only this cost basis 
information and don’t report actual returns. Cost 
basis reports make your returns look less gener-
ous because reinvested distributions increase 
your original investment and seemingly reduce 
your returns. I know from experience with coun-
seling clients and students who have taken my 
courses that investors often look at cost basis 
reports and assume that the reports tell them 
what their investment returns are. This hap-
pens partly because of the cost basis reports’ 
misleading names, such as “investment perfor-
mance” or “investment analysis.”
The difference between the rate of return 
using the cost basis and IRR methods is gen-
erally substantial. For the data that I used in 
my research, the cost basis method software 
calculated a 2.7 percent annual return, and the 
IRR method software calculated a 13 percent 
annual return. The actual portfolio’s total return 
was 13 percent, but an investor using a soft-
ware package that calculates only cost basis 
is led to believe that her profit was just 2.7 per-
cent (which is correct for tax purposes only for 
a non-retirement account).
Is all this calculation method mumbo jumbo too 
technical for your taste? Because they already 
have the data on your accounts, more invest-
ment firms can and hopefully someday will be 
able to send you your account’s performance 
numbers. To date, surprisingly few investment 
firms provide personal investment returns.

353
 Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
People who make investments at various times throughout the year and want 
to know what their actual returns were during the year can use software to 
get answers. Unless you’re a frequent trader and are trying to measure the 
success of your trading, knowing the exact returns based on the precise dates 
that you fed money into investments has limited value. This fact is especially 
true if you’re a regular, dollar-cost-averaging investor (see Chapter 3). Also 
know that increasing numbers of investment companies are providing personal 
return data via their Web site and/or on account statements.
And if you’re a buy-and-hold mutual fund investor, a path that I find great 
value in, tracking software gives you limited benefits because of the time 
that entering your data requires. Mutual funds and many other published 
resources tell you what a fund’s total return was for the past year, so you 
don’t need to enter every dividend and capital gain distribution.
Investment research software
Investment research software packages usually separate investment beginners 
(and others who don’t want to spend a lot of their time managing their money) 
from those who enjoy wallowing in data and conducting primary research. If 
you already have a plan in mind and just want to get on with investing, then go 
to it! But even if you don’t want to conduct more specific research, some of the 
packages that I discuss in this section can also help you conduct online invest-
ment transactions and track an investment’s performance.
You may have the problems of sifting through too much data and differentiat-
ing the best from the mediocre and the downright awful. And unless cost is 
no object, you need to make sure that you don’t spend too much of your loot 
simply accessing the information.
Before you plunge in to the data jungle and try to become the next Peter Lynch 
or Warren Buffett and pick individual stocks, be honest about your reasons for 
wanting to research. Some investors fool themselves into believing that their 
research will help them beat the markets. Few investors, even so-called profes-
sionals, ever do. Witness the fact that over long time periods (ten-plus years), 
mutual funds that invest in a fixed market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 
500, outperform about three-quarters of their actively managed peers thanks 
to the index fund’s lower operating expenses (see Chapter 8).
Researching individual securities
 
If you like to invest in individual securities, the Value Line Investment Analyzer 
helps you research individual stocks using the data that the Value Line 
Investment Survey provides (as I discuss in Chapter 6). This software package 
lets you sift through Value Line’s data efficiently. You can also use it to track 
your stock portfolio.

354
Par t V: Investing Resources 
A two-month introductory offer for Value Line’s software costs $75 ($95 for 
the “Plus Edition,” which also tracks small- and medium-company stocks), 
and an annual subscription costs $598 for monthly updates ($995 for the 
more comprehensive version). The software is available from Value Line at 
800-654-0508 or by visiting its Web site at www.valueline.com.
Morningstar, which is better known for its mutual fund information, has 
followed in Value Line’s footsteps in providing lots of data on individual 
stocks. Morningstar’s Principia for Stocks has data and features equivalent 
to what Value Line’s Plus Edition offers. This program is intended for those 
with in-depth knowledge of how to analyze stocks and is most definitely not 
for beginners. An annual subscription to Principia for Stocks with monthly 
updates costs $675. You can reach Morningstar at 800-735-0700 or visit its 
Web site at www.morningstar.com. Morningstar offers a number of ways 
to tap in to the more basic stock data it collects through its Web site, which I 
discuss in the next section.
Researching mutual funds
 
For mutual funds, Morningstar and Value Line both publish a number of 
software packages, the best of which are similar in price to the Value Line 
Investment Survey. These packages are geared toward more sophisticated 
investors who understand mutual funds and how to select them. For more 
details, pick up a copy of the latest edition of my book Mutual Funds For 
Dummies (published by Wiley).
Investigating Internet Resources
As people interested in managing their money surf the Internet, thousands of 
Web sites have sprung up to meet the demand. Although the low barriers to 
entry in the online world make it easy for scammers and incompetents to flog 
their wares and flawed advice, this medium can offer some helpful resources 
if you know where to look and how to discern the good from the not-so-good.
The Securities and Exchange Commission shutters numerous online scams, 
such as the one that bilked investors out of more than $3.5 million by prom-
ising to double investors’ money in four months in a fictitious security they 
called “prime bank.”
 
Although you may be smart enough to avoid offers that promise pie in the sky, 
you’re far more likely to fall for unsound financial advice, which is in abun-
dance online. You can find plenty of self-serving advertorial content and bad 
advice online, so you should be wary and cautious. The next section offers 
tips for evaluating Internet resources.

355
 Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
Evaluating online resources
Fraud and bad financial advice existed long before the Internet ever came 
around. The SEC describes online scams as “new medium, same message.” 
The tips in the following sections can help you find the nuggets of helpful 
online advice and avoid the land mines.
Checking out agendas
Get an idea of who’s behind a site before you trust its information. When nav-
igating the Internet for investment purposes, remember that financial service 
companies that want to sell you something erect the vast majority of sites. 
Thus, the “free” entrance fee to these sites is driven by companies wanting 
you to buy what they’re selling.
Some sites go to extraordinary lengths — including providing lots of informa-
tion and advice and attempting to conceal the identity of the company that 
runs the site — to disguise their agendas. Therefore, don’t turn to the Web 
for advice or opinions, which usually aren’t objective. Approach online finan-
cial calculators with skepticism. Most are simplistic and biased.
 
Many Web sites have icons that you can click to see some background on the 
site’s sponsor and to find out whether the site solicits potential advertisers. 
With a simple click, you can quickly see that a site purporting to be a reference 
service of the best small-company stocks in which to invest may be nothing 
more than an online Yellow Pages of companies that paid the site an advertis-
ing fee. Look for sites that exercise quality control in what they post and use 
sensible screening criteria for outside information or companies they list.
Just because every Tom, Dick, and Jane can easily and at relatively low cost 
set up an Internet site doesn’t mean that their Web sites and advice are 
worthy of your time. Not surprisingly, the financial companies with reputa-
tions for integrity offline are the ones that offer some of the best integrity 
online. For example, as I discuss later in this chapter, the leading and most 
investor-friendly investment companies often have the best education-
oriented Web sites.
Soliciting grassroots customer feedback
The Internet can be a useful place to do consumer research. The more 
enlightening message board conversations that I’ve encountered start with 
someone asking what others thought about particular financial service firms, 
such as brokerage firms. If you’re investigating a certain financial service, the 
Internet can be an efficient way to get feedback from other people who have 
experience dealing with that firm.

356
Par t V: Investing Resources 
 
In order to find a dozen people offline who have done business with a given firm, 
you’d probably have to speak with hundreds of people. Online, finding customers 
is a snap. Those who feel wronged by a particular firm are more than willing to 
share their gripes through sites such as www.PlanetFeedback.com. As in 
the offline world, though, don’t believe everything you hear, and watch out 
for employees of a given firm who post flattering comments about their firms 
and dis the competition.
Verifying advice and information offline
 
Enhance the value of the online information you gather by verifying it else-
where. You can do some fact checking both online and offline. For example, if 
you’re contemplating the purchase of some stock based on financial data that 
you read on an investing site, first check out those numbers at the library or 
at one of the Web sites I recommend later in this chapter.
Lots of Internet investment advice (and most of the scams) focus on smaller 
companies and investment start-ups; unfortunately, these are often the most 
difficult businesses to locate information about. The SEC requires compa-
nies that are raising less than $1 million to file a Form D. To inquire whether 
a company has filed Form D, call the SEC’s Office of Investor Education 
and Advocacy at 202-551-8090 or send an e-mail to publicinfo@sec.gov. 
Also check with your state securities regulator. For contact information for 
state regulators, you may call the North American Securities Administrators 
Association at 202-737-0900 or visit its Web site at www.nasaa.org/
QuickLinks/ContactYourRegulator.cfm.
And if something does sound too good to be true, check out and possibly 
report your concerns to Internet fraud-fighting organization sites. In addi-
tion to the SEC’s Web site, check out the National Association of Securities 
Dealers Regulation Web site (www.nasdr.com) and the National Consumers 
League’s Fraud Information Center (www.fraud.org; 800-876-7060).
The best investment Web sites
Although you can live without the Internet and not suffer any financial or 
educational consequences, the quality of what’s on the Internet is gradually 
improving, and a handful of sites are setting a high standard.
In addition to the consumer advocacy sites that I recommend earlier in this 
chapter, here are my top picks for investing sites worthy of your online time.
CorporateInformation.com
 
CorporateInformation.com is owned and operated by Wright Investors’ Services, 
which, in addition to managing money for affluent individuals, also publishes 

357
 Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
comprehensive reports on thousands of companies around the globe. Those 
wanting to do Web-based stock research will also enjoy the many links to other 
Internet investing information and research sites. This site also provides 
plenty of current business news.
CXO Advisory
CXO Advisory’s excellent Web site (www.cxoadvisory.com) was created and 
is run by Steve LeCompte. In addition to tracking macroeconomic measures 
(such as corporate earnings, inflation rates, and so on) that affect stock prices, 
CXO Advisory’s site also tracks the performance of numerous gurus and pun-
dits’ stock market calls. For example, you can see how accurate prominent 
radio talk show hosts, television commentators, magazine and online colum-
nists, and others have been with their public stock market predictions.
What I especially like about this site is that LeCompte isn’t selling anything 
that would create a conflict of interest. He’s a superb and detail-oriented ana-
lyst who enjoys doing and providing interesting stock market research. The 
more I’ve used his site, the more I’ve enjoyed it (comics included from his 
daughter) and found it useful.
Look who’s talking
If you’re at a cocktail party and you receive 
investing information and advice from some-
one you’ve just met, check him out to deter-
mine how much credence you should give to 
his words. And no matter how wise he seems, 
you shouldn’t judge him on the basis of just one 
conversation.
In the online world, you need to do the same, but 
you may have greater difficulty determining who’s 
doing the talking and why. On some Internet sites, 
visitors may post comments and opinions on 
message boards (the online equivalent of a big 
bulletin board).
As the National Association of Securities Dealers 
(NASD) says on its Web site, “In most instances, 
there is simply no way to uncover someone’s 
true identity. Are you getting information from 
a broker, short seller, corporate insider, ama-
teur investor, or stock touter?” You have to 
use a little induction and a lot of intuition. Start 
by eliminating any advice from online posters 
who are totally anonymous. Pseudonyms are 
common online, and some salespeople try to 
hide their true identities.
Among the more popular message boards on 
the Internet are those where people debate 
and discuss the prospects for individual stocks. 
The postings play fast and loose with the facts. 
“Investors need to understand that, although 
they may be reading honest conversations, 
they could just as easily be looking at the work 
of a corporate insider, stock promoter, or short 
seller using an alias to deceive the unsuspect-
ing or to manipulate the market,” says the NASD 
Regulation unit.

Morningstar.com
The behemoth of the mutual fund data business, Morningstar has a Web site 
(www.morningstar.com) that provides information and tools for mutual 
fund and stock research. The basic stuff is free, but to access the analyst 
reports and stock research reports, among other premium content, you must 
pony up $159 per year. In addition to providing more data than you could 
ever possibly digest on funds and stocks, this site includes short, insightful 
articles that are useful to more educated investors.
St. Louis Federal Reserve
For those who enjoy analyzing economic data, the St. Louis Federal Reserve 
Web site (www.research.stlouisfed.org) is the place to be. In addi-
tion to sometimes heady articles such as “Pandemic Economics: The 1918 
Influenza and Its Modern-Day Implications,” this site provides a treasure 
trove of current economic data along with graphs. The long-term graphs are 
particularly useful in providing folks with the often missing long-term per-
spective in our daily diet of news.
For example, I had to laugh the other day when I saw a headline online that 
screamed “Dollar at Record Low.” The article only mentioned the euro, and 
it never pointed out that the euro only came into existence in 1999! In fact, 
when you compare the dollar to a broad basket of other currencies repre-
sented by our trading partners, the U.S. dollar is still more than double the 
value it was a generation ago. Anyone can see this fact for themselves by 
examining the trade weighted exchange index (TWEXBMTH) on the St. Louis 
Fed site. (According to the site, the index is “A weighted average of the for-
eign exchange value of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of a broad group 
of major U.S. trading partners. Broad currency index includes the Euro Area, 
Canada, Japan, Mexico, China, United Kingdom, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, 
Hong Kong, Malaysia, Brazil, Switzerland, Thailand, Philippines, Australia, 
Indonesia, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Sweden, Argentina, Venezuela, 
Chile, and Colombia.”)
Sec.gov
 
All publicly held companies and mutual funds must file annual and quarterly 
reports and other documents electronically with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC). This information is easily accessible for free 
(paid for by tax dollars) on the SEC Web site (www.sec.gov).
If you’re researching individual companies, you can find all the corporate 
reports — annual reports, 10-Ks, and the like — that I discuss in Chapter 6 via 
this Web site. Or you can call the individual companies that interest you and 
have them mail you the desired material.

359
 Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
The SEC site isn’t pretty, and searching the Electronic Data Gathering, 
Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR) database can be challenging, espe-
cially for the novice investor. But if you’re tenacious, you may find something 
that’s hard to come by on the Web these days: cold, hard facts and no spin.
Vanguard.com
 
Few sites run by investment companies are worth visiting unless you’re an 
account holder at the firm and you want to review your accounts or conduct 
transactions online. The reason: Much of the content is self-serving, biased, 
and advertorial in nature. The nation’s second-largest mutual fund company, 
the Vanguard Group, operates a site (www.vanguard.com) that is the 
exception.
Online investing geniuses?
Nowhere will you find more self-proclaimed 
investing geniuses than online. Here are some 
important perspectives and lessons to keep in 
mind as you surf the Web:
  Beware of promises of easy riches. To 
deter investors from mutual funds, one Web 
site says of its stock picking, “We hope to 
have put you in position to nearly double 
the S&P 500 . . . it’ll demand little research 
per year, and present you little, if any, long-
term risk.” If investing were that easy, we’d 
all be rich! And as any professional money 
manager knows firsthand, successfully 
managing a portfolio of individual stocks 
takes time, not just a few hours per year.
  Beware of bloated performance claims. Not 
surprisingly, many online investing pundits 
hype claimed returns from their investment 
recommendations. If you can’t independently 
verify a performance claim, don’t believe it. 
Also, keep in mind that even if performance 
numbers are indeed accurate, calculated 
returns often overlook trading commissions 
and taxes (which can be especially high for 
sites that advocate selling investments after 
holding them for less than one year).
  Successful investing doesn’t require fol-
lowing the market closely. Buying and 
holding index or other quality mutual funds 
for many years doesn’t take much review 
time — perhaps as little as an hour once 
per year to read the fund’s annual report. 
The daily and even minute-by-minute track-
ing of stock prices on many sites causes 
investors to lose sight of the long term and 
the big picture (although it draws more visi-
tors to the site, which satisfies advertisers 
and enriches the site owners).
The bottom line? Be skeptical of financial 
prognosticators, online or off. Like politicians, 
they’re out to make themselves look as good as 
possible, taking credit when things go well and 
blaming external forces when they don’t. For an 
independent assessment of a supposed guru’s 
investment picks, check out CXO Advisory, dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter, and Hulbert’s 
Financial Digest. See Chapter 17 for more about 
investment newsletters.

Of course, you can find details on Vanguard’s fine family of funds here, but 
you also find some of the best educational materials that I’ve seen online. I’m 
not surprised — one reason that I’ve long liked the company is that it advo-
cates for investors’ best interests (see Chapter 8).
And if you’re one of the millions of Vanguard shareholders, you can access 
your accounts and perform most transactions online. Vanguard’s discount 
brokerage division, also accessible online, allows for investing in many other 
fund companies’ funds (as well as Vanguard’s) through a single account. The 
company’s Web site also enables you to link accounts that you may hold 
through most other financial institutions.

Ten Investing Obstacles 
to Conquer
In This Chapter
 Putting your faith in experts
 Letting your emotions guide your investment decisions
 Giving up when the market takes a plunge
 Ignoring your financial big picture
Just as with raising children or in one’s career, “success” with personal 
investing is in the eye of the beholder. In my work as a financial counselor, 
instructor, and writer, I’ve come to define a successful investor as someone 
who, with a modest commitment of time, develops an investment plan to 
accomplish financial and personal goals and earns returns commensurate 
with the risk he’s willing to accept.
In this chapter, I point out ten common obstacles that may keep you from 
fully realizing your financial goals and share tips and advice for overcoming 
those obstacles on the road to investing success.
Trusting Authority
Some investors assume that an advisor is competent and ethical if she has a 
lofty title (financial consultant, vice president, and so on), dresses well, and 
works in a snazzy office. Such accessories are often indicators of salespeople — 
not objective advisors — who recommend investments that will earn them 
big commissions that come out of your investment dollars.
Additionally, if you overtrust an advisor, you may not research and monitor 
your investments as carefully as you should. Figuring that Mr. Vice President 
is an expert, some investors go along without ever questioning his advice or 
watching what’s going on with their investments.

364
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
You should also question authority elsewhere in the investment business. Too 
many investors blindly follow analysts’ stock recommendations without 
considering the many conflicts of interest that such brokerage firm employees 
have. Brokerage analysts are often cheerleaders for buying various companies’ 
stock because their firms are courting the business of new stock and bond 
issuance of the same companies. And just because a big-name accounting firm 
has blessed a company’s financial statements (Enron) or a company’s CEO 
says everything is fine (Bear Stearns) doesn’t make a firm’s financial state-
ments accurate or its conditions sound.
 
You can’t possibly evaluate the competence and agenda of someone you hire 
until you understand the lay of the land. You can’t possibly know for sure that 
an analyst’s report or a professional service firm’s recommendation or approval 
of a company is worth the paper it’s printed upon. Read good publications (see 
Part V) on the topic to master the jargon and figure out how to evaluate invest-
ments. Seek independent second opinions before you act on someone’s recom-
mendations. If you’re in the market for a broker, be sure to read Chapter 9.
Get ting Swept Up by Euphoria
Feeling strength and safety in numbers, some investors are lured into buying 
hot stocks and sectors (for example, industries like technology, health care, 
biotechnology, retail, and so on) after major price increases. Psychologically, 
it’s reassuring to buy into something that’s going up and gaining accolades. 
The obvious danger with this practice is buying into investments selling at 
inflated prices that too soon deflate.
In the U.S. stock market by the late 1990s, investors were getting spoiled with 
gains year after year in excess of the historic average annual return of 9 to 10 
percent. Numerous surveys conducted during this period showed that many 
investors expected to earn returns in the range of 15 to 20 percent annually, 
nearly double the historic average. As always happens, though, after a period 
of excessively high returns such as those of the 1990s, returns were below 
average in the subsequent period beginning in 2000 (and were quite negative 
in the early 2000s). During the market slump in the early 2000s, real estate–
related stocks continued to do well; some folks mistakenly believed that the 
housing sector was immune to setbacks and were surprised by the slump in 
that sector in the late 2000s.
 
Develop an overall allocation among various investments (especially diversified 
mutual funds), and don’t make knee-jerk decisions to change your allocation 
based upon what the latest hot sectors are. If anything, de-emphasize or avoid 
stocks and sectors that are at the top of the performance charts. Think back to 
the last time you went bargain shopping for a consumer item — you looked for 
value, not high prices. See Chapter 5 to find out how to spot good values in the 
financial markets and speculative bubbles to avoid.

365
 Chapter 20: Ten Investing Obstacles to Conquer
Being Overconfident
As I discuss in Part V, newsletters, books, and even some financial periodicals 
lead investors to believe that you can be the next Peter Lynch or Warren 
Buffett if you follow a simple stock-picking system. The advent of the Internet 
and online trading capabilities has spawned a whole new generation of short-
term (sometimes even same-day) traders.
In my work as a financial counselor, I came across plenty of people who lost 
a lot of money after they had an early winner and had attributed that success 
to their investing genius. These folks usually landed on my doorstep after 
great and humbling losses woke them up.
 
If you have the speculative bug, earmark a small portion of your portfolio (no 
more than 10 to 20 percent) for more aggressive investments. See Chapter 5 
for more information on questions to help you decide whether you or some-
one you know has a gambling problem.
Giving Up When Things Look Bleak
Inexperienced or nervous investors may be tempted to bail out when it appears 
that an investment isn’t always profitable and enjoyable. Some investors 
dump falling investments precisely at the times when they should be doing 
the reverse — buying more. Whenever the U.S. stock market drops more 
than a few percentage points in a short period, it attracts a lot of attention, 
which then leads to concern, anxiety, and in some cases, panic. Corrections 
in excess of 10 percent, such as happened in late 2007 and early 2008, lead to 
all sorts of hand wringing and gloom-and-doom talk.
Investing always involves uncertainty. Many people forget this, especially 
during good economic times. I find that investors are more likely to feel more 
comfortable with riskier investments, such as stocks, when they recognize 
that all investments carry uncertainty and risk — just in different forms.
 
History has repeatedly proved that continuing to buy stocks during down 
markets increases your long-term returns. The worst thing you can do in a 
slumping market is to throw in the towel.
Unfortunately, the short-term focus that the media so often takes causes some 
investors to worry that their investments are in shambles during the inevitable 
bumps in the road. As I discuss in Part V, the media are often to blame because 
they hype short-term events and blow those events out of proportion to capti-
vate viewers and listeners. History has shown that financial markets recover; 

366
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
recovery is just a question of time. If you invest for the long term, then the 
last six weeks — or even the last couple of years — is a short period. Plus, 
countless studies demonstrate that no one can predict the future, so you gain 
little from trying to base your investment plans on predictions. In fact, you 
can lose more money by trying to time the markets.
Larger-than-normal market declines hold a significant danger for investors: 
They may encourage decision making that’s based on emotion rather than 
logic. Just ask anyone who sold after the stock market collapsed in 1987 — 
the U.S. stock market dropped 35 percent in a matter of weeks in the fall of 
that year. Since then, even with the significant declines in the early 2000s, the 
U.S. market has risen more than sevenfold!
 
Investors who can’t withstand the volatility of riskier growth-oriented invest-
ments, such as stocks, may be better off not investing in such vehicles to 
begin with. Examining your returns over longer periods helps you keep the 
proper perspective. If a short-term downdraft in your investments depresses 
you, avoid tracking your investment values closely. Also, consider investing 
in highly diversified, less-volatile funds that hold stocks worldwide as well as 
bonds (see Chapter 8).
Refusing to Accept a Loss
Although some investors realize that they can’t withstand losses and sell at 
the first signs of trouble, other investors find that selling a losing investment 
is so painful and unpleasant that they continue to hold a poorly performing 
investment, despite the investment’s poor future prospects. Psychological 
research backs this up — people find the pain of accepting a given loss twice 
as intense as the pleasure of accepting a gain of equal magnitude.
 
Analyze your lagging investments to identify why they perform poorly. If a 
given investment is down because similar ones are also in decline, hold on 
to it. However, if something is inherently wrong with the investment — such 
as high fees or poor management — make taking the loss more palatable by 
remembering two things:
 
 If your investment is a non-retirement account investment, selling at a 
loss helps reduce your income taxes.
 
 Consider the “opportunity cost” of continuing to keep your money in a 
lousy investment — that is, what returns can you get in the future if you 
switch to a “better” investment?

367
 Chapter 20: Ten Investing Obstacles to Conquer
Overmonitoring Your Investments
The investment world seems so risky and fraught with pitfalls that some people 
believe that closely watching an investment can help alert them to impending 
danger. “The constant tracking is not unlike the attempt to relieve anxiety by 
fingering worry beads. Yet paradoxically, it can increase emotional distress 
because it requires a constant state of vigilance,” says psychologist Dr. Paul 
Minsky.
In my work as a financial counselor, I see that investors who are the most 
anxious about their investments and most likely to make impulsive trading 
decisions are the ones who watch their holdings too closely, especially those 
who monitor prices daily. The proliferation of Internet sites and stock market 
cable television programs offering up-to-the-minute quotations gives these 
investors even more temptation to overmonitor investments.
 
Restrict your “diet” of financial information and advice. Quality is far more 
important than quantity. Watching the daily price gyrations of investments 
is akin to eating too much junk food — doing so may satisfy your short-term 
cravings but at the cost of your long-term health. If you invest in diversified 
mutual funds (see Chapter 8), you really don’t need to examine your fund’s 
performance more than once or twice per year. An ideal time to review your 
funds is when you receive their annual or semiannual reports. Although many 
investors track their funds daily or weekly, far fewer read their annual reports. 
Reading these reports can help you keep a long-term perspective and gain 
some understanding as to why your funds perform as they do and how they 
compare to major market averages.
Being Unclear about Your Goals
Investing is more complicated than simply setting your financial goals (see 
Chapter 3) and choosing solid investments to help you achieve them. Awareness 
and understanding of the less tangible issues can maximize your chances for 
investing success.
 
In addition to considering your goals in a traditional sense (when you want 
to retire, how much of your kids’ college costs you want to pay) before you 
invest, you should also consider what you want and don’t want to get from the 
investment process. Do you treat investing as a hobby or simply as another 
one of life’s tasks, such as maintaining your home? Do you enjoy the intellec-
tual challenge of picking your own stocks? Don’t just ponder these questions 
on your own; discuss them with family members, too — after all, you’re all 
going to have to live with your decisions and investment results.

368
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
Ignoring Your Real Financial Problems
I know plenty of high-income earners, including more than a few who earn six 
figures annually, who have little to invest. Some of these people have high-
interest debt outstanding on credit cards and auto loans, yet they spend end-
less hours researching and tracking investments.
I also know many people who built significant personal wealth despite having 
modest-paying jobs. The difference: the ability to live within your means.
If you don’t earn a high income, you may be tempted to think that you can’t 
save. Even if you are a high-income earner, you may think that you can hit an 
investment home run to accomplish your goals or that you can save more if 
you can bump up your income. This way of thinking justifies spending most 
of what you earn and saving little now. Investing is far more exciting than 
examining your spending and making cutbacks. If you need help coming up 
with more money to invest, see the latest edition of my book Personal Finance 
For Dummies (published by Wiley).
Overemphasizing Certain Risks
Saving money is only half the battle. The other half is making your money 
grow. Over long time periods, earning just a few percent more makes a big 
difference in the size of your nest egg. Earning inflation-beating returns is 
easy to do if you’re willing to invest in stocks, real estate, and small busi-
nesses. Figure 20-1 shows you how much more money you’ll have in 25 years 
if you can earn investment returns that are greater than the rate of inflation 
(which is currently running at about 3 percent).
As I discuss in Chapter 2, ownership investments (stocks, real estate, and 
small business) have historically generated returns greater than the infla-
tion rate by 6 percent or more, while lending investments (savings accounts 
and bonds) tend to generate returns of only 1 to 2 percent above inflation. 
However, some investors keep too much of their money in lending invest-
ments out of fear of holding an investment that can fall greatly in value. 
Although ownership investments can plunge in value, you need to keep in 
mind that inflation and taxes eat away at your lending investment balances.

Believing in Gurus
Stock market declines, like earthquakes, bring all sorts of prognosticators, 
soothsayers, and self-anointed gurus out of the woodwork, particularly among 
those in the investment community, such as newsletter writers, who have 
something to sell. The words may vary, but the underlying message doesn’t: “If 
you had been following my sage advice, you’d be much better off now.”
 
People spend far too much of their precious time and money in pursuit of 
a guru who can tell them when and what to buy and sell. Peter Lynch, the 
former manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, amassed one of the best long-
term stock market investing track records. His stock-picking ability allowed 
him to beat the market averages by just a few percent per year. However, even 
he says that you can’t time the markets, and he acknowledges knowing many 
pundits who have correctly predicted the future course of the stock market 
“once in a row”!
Clearly, in the world of investing, the most successful investors earn much 
better returns than the worst ones. But what may surprise you is that you 
can end up much closer to the top of the investing performance heap than 
the bottom if you follow some relatively simple rules, such as regularly 
saving and investing in low-cost growth investments. In fact, by doing so you 
can beat many of the full-time investment professionals.

You’re Selling an Investment

ou can and should hold good investments for years and decades. Each 
year, people sell trillions of dollars’ worth of investments. My experience 
helping people get a handle on their investments suggests that too many people 
sell for the wrong reasons and hold on to investments that they should sell. 
In this chapter, I highlight important issues to consider when you contemplate 
selling your investments.
Remembering Your Preferences 
and Goals
 
If your life has changed since the last time you took a good look at your invest-
ment portfolio (or you’ve inherited investments), your current portfolio may no 
longer make sense for you. I generally recommend that you review your holdings 
once per year. Don’t make quick decisions about selling — take your time and be 
sure that you understand tax and other ramifications before you sell.
The time that it takes you to manage your portfolio, for example, is a vital 
matter if you’re starved for time or weary of managing time-consuming 
investments. Leo, for example, loved to research, track, and trade individual 
stocks — until his daughter was born. Then Leo realized how many hours his 
hobby was taking away from his family, and that realization put his priorities 
into perspective. Leo now invests in time-friendly mutual funds and doesn’t 
follow them like a hawk.

372
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
One of my clients, Mary, loves investing in real estate because she enjoys the 
challenge of researching, selecting, and managing her properties. She works 
in a job where she has to put up with lots of controlling, stressed-out bosses. 
For Mary, real estate isn’t just a profitable investment; it’s also a way of 
expressing herself and growing personally.
Maintaining Balance in Your Portfolio
A good reason to sell an investment is to allow you to better diversify your 
portfolio. Suppose that before reading this book, you purchased a restaurant 
stock every time you read about one. Now your portfolio resembles several 
bad strip malls, and restaurant stocks comprise 80 percent of your holdings. 
Or maybe, through your job, you’ve accumulated such a hefty chunk of stock 
in your employer that this stock now overwhelms the rest of your investments.
It’s time for you to diversify. Sell off some of the holdings that you have too 
much of and invest the proceeds in solid investments, such as those that I 
recommend in this book. If you think your employer’s stock is going to be 
a superior investment, holding a big chunk is your gamble. At a minimum, 
review Chapter 6 to see how to evaluate a particular stock. But remember to 
consider the consequences if you’re wrong about your employer’s stock.
 
Conservative investors often keep too much of their money in bank accounts, 
Treasury bills, and the like. Read Chapter 3 to come up with an overall invest-
ment strategy that fits with the rest of your personal financial situation.
Deciding Which Investments Are Keepers
Often, people are tempted to sell an investment for the wrong reasons. One 
natural human tendency is to want to sell investments that have declined in 
value. Some people fear a further fall, and they don’t want to be affiliated with 
a loser, especially when money is involved. I think this reaction resembles 
the phenomenon of piling into the lifeboats when a ship springs a leak.
 
Step back, take some deep breaths, and examine the merits of the investment 
you’re considering selling. If an investment is otherwise still sound, why bail out 
when prices are down and a sale is going on? What are you going to do with the 
money? If anything, you should be contemplating buying more of such an invest-
ment. Don’t make a decision to sell based on your current emotional response, 
especially to recent news events. If bad news has recently hit, it’s already old 
news. Don’t base your investment holdings on such transitory events.

373
 Chapter 21: Ten Things to Consider When You’re Selling an Investment
Use the criteria in this book for finding good investments to evaluate the 
worthiness of your current holdings. If an investment is fundamentally sound, 
don’t sell it.
 
A better reason to sell an investment is that it comes with high fees relative to 
comparable investments. For example, if you own a bond mutual fund that is 
socking it to you with fees of 1 percent per year, check out Chapter 8 to dis-
cover high-performing, lower-cost funds.
Tuning In to the Tax Consequences
When you sell investments that you hold outside a tax-sheltered retirement 
account, such as an IRA or a 401(k), taxes should be one factor in your decision. 
(See Chapter 3 to find out about tax rates that apply to the sale of an investment 
as well as to the distributions that investments make.) If the investments are 
inside retirement accounts, taxes aren’t an issue because the accounts are shel-
tered from taxation, unless you’re withdrawing funds from the accounts.
 
Just because you pay tax on a profit from selling a non-retirement account 
investment doesn’t mean that you should avoid selling. With real estate, you can 
often avoid paying taxes on the profit that you make (see Chapters 10 and 11).
With stocks and mutual funds, things get more complex because you can 
specify which shares you want to sell. This option makes selling decisions 
more complicated, but you may want to consider specifying what shares 
you’re selling because you may be able to save taxes. (Read the next section 
for more information.) If you sell all your shares of a particular security that 
you own, you need not concern yourself with specifying which shares you’re 
selling.
Figuring Out What Shares Cost
When you sell a portion of the shares of a security (for example, stock, bond, 
or mutual fund) that you own, specifying which shares you’re selling may 
benefit you taxwise. Here’s an example to show you why you may want to 
specify selling certain shares — especially those shares that cost you more 
to buy — so you can save on your taxes.
Suppose you own a total of 300 shares of a stock and you want to sell 100 
shares to pay for a root canal. Suppose further that you bought 100 of these 
shares a long, long time ago at $10 per share, 100 shares two years ago at $16 
per share, and the last 100 shares one year ago at $14 per share. Today the 

374
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
stock is at $20 per share. Although you didn’t get rich, you’re grateful that 
you haven’t lost your shirt the way some of your stock-picking pals have.
The good tax folks at the IRS allow you to choose which shares you want to 
sell. Electing to sell the 100 shares that you purchased at the highest price — 
in other words, those that you bought for $16 per share two years ago — saves 
you in taxes. (To comply with the tax laws, you must identify the shares that 
you want the broker to sell by the original date of purchase and/or the cost 
when you sell the shares. The brokerage firm through which you sell the stock 
should include this information on the confirmation slip that you receive for 
the sale.)
The other method of accounting for which shares are sold is the method that 
the IRS forces you to use if you don’t specify before the sale which shares you 
want to sell — the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. FIFO means that the first shares 
that you sell are simply the first shares that you bought. Not surprisingly, 
because most stocks appreciate over time, the FIFO method leads to you 
paying more tax sooner. The FIFO accounting procedure leads to the conclu-
sion that the 100 shares you sell are the 100 that you bought long, long ago 
at $10 per share. Thus, you owe a larger amount of taxes than if you sold the 
higher-cost shares under the specification method.
 
Although you save taxes today if you specify selling the shares that you 
bought more recently at a higher price, remember that when you finally sell 
the other shares, you’ll then owe taxes on the larger profit. The longer you 
expect to hold these other shares, the greater the value you’ll likely derive 
from postponing, realizing the larger gains and paying more in taxes. If you 
expect your tax rate to decline in the future, you have another good reason to 
hold off selling the shares in which you have greater profit.
When you sell shares in a mutual fund, the IRS has yet another accounting 
method, known as the average cost method, for figuring your taxable profit or 
loss when you sell a portion of your holdings in a mutual fund. This method 
comes in handy if you bought shares in chunks over time or reinvested the 
fund payouts into purchasing more shares of the fund. As the name suggests, 
the average cost method allows you to take an average cost for all the shares 
you bought over time.
Selling Investments with Hefty Profits
Of course, no one likes to pay taxes, but if an investment you own has appre-
ciated in value, someday you’ll have to pay tax when you sell it, unless you 
plan on passing the investment to your heirs upon your death. The IRS wipes 
out the capital gains tax on appreciated assets at your death.

375
 Chapter 21: Ten Things to Consider When You’re Selling an Investment
Capital gains tax applies when you sell an investment at a higher price than 
you paid for it. As I explain in Chapter 3, your capital gains tax rate is different 
from the tax rate that you pay on ordinary income (such as from employment 
earnings or interest on bank savings accounts).
Odds are, the longer you’ve held securities such as stocks, the greater the 
capital gains you’ll have, because stocks tend to appreciate over time. If all 
your assets have appreciated greatly, you may resist selling to avoid taxes. 
However, if you need money for a major purchase, sell what you need and 
pay the tax. Even if you have to pay state as well as federal taxes totaling 
some 35 percent of the profit, you’ll have lots left. (For “longer-term” profits 
from investments held more than one year, your federal and state capital 
gains taxes would probably total less than 20 to 25 percent.) Before you 
sell, however, do some rough figuring to make sure that you’ll have enough 
money left to accomplish what you want. If you seek to sell one investment 
and reinvest in another, you’ll owe tax on the profit unless you’re selling and 
rebuying real estate (see Chapters 10 and 11).
 
If you hold a number of assets, in order to diversify and meet your other financial 
goals, give preference to selling your largest holdings with the smallest capital 
gains. If you have some securities that have profits and some with losses, you 
can sell some of each to offset the profits with the losses.
Cut ting Your (Securities) Losses
Perhaps you own some turkeys in your portfolio. If you need to raise cash for 
some particular reason, you may consider selling some securities at a loss. 
You can use losses to offset gains as long as you hold both offsetting securi-
ties for more than one year (long term) or you hold both for no more than 
one year (short term). The IRS makes this delineation because the IRS taxes 
long-term gains and losses on a different rate schedule than short-term gains 
and losses (see Chapter 3).
 
If you need to sell securities at a loss, be advised that you can’t claim more than 
$3,000 in net losses in any one year. If you sell securities with net losses totaling 
more than $3,000 in a year, you must carry the losses over to future tax years. 
This situation not only creates more tax paperwork but also delays realizing the 
value of deducting a tax loss. So try not to have net losses (losses + gains) that 
exceed $3,000 in a year.
Some tax advisors advocate doing year-end tax-loss selling with stocks, bonds, 
and mutual funds. The logic goes that if you hold a security at a loss, you should 
sell it, take the tax write-off, and then buy it (or something similar) back.

376
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
 
When selling investments for tax-loss purposes, be careful of the so-called 
wash sale rules. The IRS doesn’t allow the deduction of a loss for a security 
sale if you buy that same security back within 30 days. As long as you wait 31 
or more days, there’s no problem. If you’re selling a mutual fund, you can pur-
chase a fund similar to the one you’re selling to easily sidestep this rule.
If you own a security that has ceased trading and appears worthless (or 
you’ve made a loan that hasn’t been repaid), you can likely deduct this loss. 
Peruse the latest edition of Taxes For Dummies (published by Wiley) for more 
information on what situations are deductible and how to claim these losses 
on your annual tax return.
Selling Investments with Unknown Costs
You may not know what some investments originally cost you or the person 
who bought them and later gave them to you. If you can’t find that original 
statement, start by calling the firm where the investment was purchased. 
Whether it’s a brokerage firm or mutual fund company, the company should 
be able to send you copies of old account statements, although you may have 
to pay a small fee for this service.
Also, increasing numbers of investment firms, especially mutual fund compa-
nies, can tell you upon the sale of an investment what its original cost was. 
The cost generally calculated is the average cost for the shares you pur-
chased. See Taxes For Dummies for more ideas of what to do when original 
records aren’t available for other assets, such as real estate.
Recognizing Broker Differences
If you’re selling securities such as stocks and bonds, you need to know that 
some brokers charge more — in some cases, lots more — to sell. Even if the 
securities that you want to sell currently reside at a high-cost brokerage firm, 
you can transfer them to a discount brokerage firm. See Chapter 9 to read 
about the different types of brokerage firms and how to select the best one 
for your situation.
Finding a Trustworthy Financial Advisor
You aren’t stupid. Before you picked up this book, you may have considered 
yourself an investing dummy. I didn’t, and I still don’t, but hopefully you feel 

377
 Chapter 21: Ten Things to Consider When You’re Selling an Investment
less like a dummy after reading this book. If you delegate your investment 
decision making to an advisor, you’re likely to be disappointed.
 
Few financial advisors offer objective and knowledgeable advice. Unfortunately, 
if you’re grappling with a selling decision, finding a competent and impartial 
financial advisor to help with the decision is about as difficult as finding a 
politician who doesn’t accept special-interest money. Most financial consul-
tants work on commission, which can cloud their judgment. And among the 
minority of fee-based advisors, almost all manage money, which creates other 
conflicts of interest. The more money you give them to invest and manage, the 
more money these advisors make. If you need advice about whether to sell 
some investments, turn to a tax or financial advisor who works on an hourly 
basis.

Ten T ips for Investing 
in a Down Market
In This Chapter
 Keeping a level head amid the doom and gloom
 Identifying and fixing flaws in your portfolio
 Understanding why value stocks have less downside risk
U
nless there’s a lot of other breaking news, sharp drops in the stock 
market make headlines — stock market gyrations are great media 
fodder. Every day the market environment is different, and new stocks are 
plunging and rising. And now, with more individuals holding stocks through 
company and personal retirement plans, the media has a captive, concerned 
audience. In this chapter, I discuss how to maximize your chances for invest-
ing success when stocks take a turn for the worse.
Don’t Panic
No one enjoys turning on his car radio, clicking his television set on, or logging on 
to the Internet and getting this news: “Stocks plunge. The Dow Jones Industrial 
plummeted 400 points today.” Don’t panic — it’s just one day’s events.
Just because a home burned to the ground recently in your town and the news 
is being broadcast over all the local media, you probably wouldn’t start living 
on the street out of fear of being at home during a fire. But you might take 
some sensible precautions, such as installing smoke alarms and repairing any 
malfunctioning appliances that might cause a fire, to ensure that your home 
isn’t likely to become the next fire department statistic. Likewise, don’t shun 
stocks, which produce terrific long-term returns, just because of the down 
periods. As I discuss in Chapter 2, risk and return go hand in hand. If you want 
wealth-building investments that provide superior long-term returns, you must 
be willing to accept risk (that is, volatility and down periods).

380
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
Although other wealth-building investments, such as real estate and small 
business, go through significant declines, you generally see few headlines on 
their daily price movements. A good reason for this is that no one reports on 
the pricing of real estate and small businesses minute by minute every busi-
ness day, as is done with stock prices.
Keep Your Portfolio’s Perspective in Mind
If you follow my advice, your portfolio will consist of diversified stock hold-
ings, including some international stocks, and preferably through mutual 
funds, along with some bonds. One of my counseling clients called me when 
the stock market was dropping precipitously during the summer of 2002. “I 
just saw that the S&P 500 is now down 28 percent so far this year, and the 
NASDAQ is down 34 percent. Should I sell?”
He was quite surprised when I crunched some numbers and determined that 
his portfolio of stocks and bonds was down just 8 percent for the year. Now, 
mind you, I wasn’t trying to minimize or trivialize the fact that he had lost 
money so far that year. However, he overlooked the fact that the bonds in his 
portfolio had actually increased in value, as had some of his stock funds that 
were invested in value-oriented stocks. Please see Chapter 8 for tips on how 
to build a diversified mutual fund portfolio.
View Major Declines as Sales
 
Unlike retail stores, which experience bigger-than-normal crowds when prices 
are reduced, fewer investors, especially individual investors, want to buy 
stocks after they’ve suffered a sharp decline. When stock prices decline, don’t 
get swept up in the pessimism. View declines as the financial markets having 
a sale on stocks. Stocks usually bottom when pessimism reaches a peak. The 
reason: Those who were motivated to sell have done so, and the major selling 
has exhausted itself.
Now, I’m not saying you should randomly buy just any stock after a decline. 
For example, as I discuss in Part II, I’m not an advocate of buying individual 
stocks, especially a collection of stock focused in the same industry (such 
as technology or auto manufacturing). When technology stocks started 
declining in 2000, some investors made the mistake of buying more of them 
after prices dropped 10 or 20 percent. What such “buy on the dip” investors 
didn’t realize was that the technology stocks that they were buying were still 
grossly overpriced when measured by price/earnings ratios and other valua-
tion measures (see Chapter 5).

381
 Chapter 22: Ten T ips for Investing in a Down Market
 
You’re best off buying stocks gradually over time through well-managed, 
diversified mutual funds (see Chapter 8). When the broad stock market suffers 
a substantial decline and stocks are at reduced prices — on sale — you can 
step up your buying.
Identify Your Portfolio’s Problems
Stock market declines can be effective at quickly exposing problems with 
your portfolio. For example, when technology stocks tumbled in the early 
2000s, I started getting lots of e-mails and letters from investors who had 
loaded up on these stocks and wondered what I thought they should do with 
their holdings. Many of these investors kept thinking about how much more 
their technology stocks were worth at their peak before the decline set in.
I urged such investors to acknowledge the huge risk they were clearly taking 
by putting so many eggs in one basket. I also highlighted the dangers of chas-
ing after a hot sector, and I pointed out that today’s hot sector often becomes 
tomorrow’s laggard.
In addition to poorly diversified portfolios, a declining stock market can also 
expose the high fees you may be paying on your investments. Fewer investors 
care about getting whacked with fees amounting to, say, 2 percent annually 
when they’re making 20 percent year after year. But after a few years of low or 
negative returns, such high fees become quite painful and more obvious.
Avoid Growth Stocks If You 
Get Queasy Easily
In a sustained stock market slide (bear market), the stocks that get clobbered 
the most tend to be the ones that were most overpriced from the period of 
the previous market rise (bull market). Like fads such as hula hoops, pet 
rocks, and Cabbage Patch dolls, in each bull market, particular types of 
growth stocks, such as Internet companies or biotechnology companies, can 
be especially hot.
 
Predicting the duration and magnitude of a bear market is nearly impossible. 
Consequently, wouldn’t it make sense to focus your stock investing on those 
stocks that produce solid long-term returns and that tend to decline less in 
a major market decline? So-called value stocks tend to be among the safer 
types of stocks to hold during a bear market. Value stocks generally have less 

382
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
downside risk because they typically pay higher dividends and have relatively 
greater underlying asset values in comparison to their stock valuations.
As has happened in some past bear markets, numerous value-oriented stocks 
actually appreciated during the bear market in the early 2000s. Please see 
Chapter 8 for my discussion of the different types of stocks and mutual funds 
that practice value stock investing.
Tune Out Negative, Hyped Media
When the stock market is crumbling, subjecting yourself to a daily diet 
of bad news and conflicting opinions about what to do next makes most 
investors do the wrong things. When major stock markets were really get-
ting clobbered during the summer of 2002, a person in my hometown said 
to me, “Eric, it seems that the civilized world as we know it is coming to an 
end. We have all this tension and conflict in the Middle East, we’re at war in 
Afghanistan, the news media are talking about our going after Iraq next, no 
one can believe company financial statements, and stocks are too risky to 
hold. All I keep hearing is bad news when I turn on my television or go online. 
Shouldn’t I just sell my stocks and buy something else?”
I told this person that he should stop watching and focusing upon bad news. 
Just like a steady diet of junk food is bad for your physical health, a continu-
ous stream of negative, hyped news is bad for your financial health. In my 
observations, dwelling on bad news doesn’t do such great things for people’s 
emotional health, either. (Fortunately, this acquaintance took my advice and 
profited handsomely when the stock market rebounded tremendously in the 
mid-2000s.)
 
Conflict is always occurring somewhere in the world. The business world 
will always have unethical and corrupt company executives. Holding stocks 
always carries risk. That’s why those who see the glass as half full and who 
see the positive and not just the negative build wealth by holding stocks, real 
estate, and small business over the long term.
Ignore Large Point Declines — Consider 
the Percentages
It drives me crazy when the news media show a one-day chart of a major 
stock market index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, on a day when 
the index drops a large number of points. In recent years, 200- and 300-point 
drops in the Dow happened fairly frequently.

383
 Chapter 22: Ten T ips for Investing in a Down Market
 
Look at the percentage decline in an index rather than at a point decline. 
Although 200 to 300 points sounds like a horrendous drop, such a drop 
amounts to a move of about 2 percent. No one likes losing that portion of their 
wealth invested in stocks in one day, but the percentage of change sounds 
less horrifying than the point change.
Don’t Believe You Need a Rich Dad 
to Be a Successful Investor
A young man wrote to me about an interview that he had read about the Rich 
Dad, Poor Dad series, by author Robert Kiyosaki. In the interview, Kiyosaki 
said that the rich are different from the rest of us because “They teach their 
children how to be rich. . . . These get-rich techniques include investing with 
leverage . . . and staying away from mutual funds and 401(k)s, which are way 
too risky.”
The young man came from a humble background and had been salting money 
away in mutual funds through his company retirement plan. But he thought 
that he might be doomed to a lifetime of poverty after reading what the Rich 
Dad guru had to say. Here’s what I told him.
I’ve known plenty of people over the years who came from nonwealthy fami-
lies who built substantial wealth by living within their means and by invest-
ing in the three wealth-building assets that I focus on in this book: stocks, 
real estate, and small business.
With regard to mutual funds and 401(k)s, in addition to his saying that they 
are way too risky, Kiyosaki also says, “Those vehicles are only good for about 
20 percent of the population, people making $100,000 or more.” I couldn’t 
disagree more. In fact, my experience is that mutual funds are tailor-made for 
nonwealthy people who don’t have the assets to properly create a diversified 
portfolio themselves.
Kiyosaki also says that he doesn’t like mutual funds because “Mutual funds 
have got no insurance from a stock market crash. To me, that’s sad, and I am 
concerned.” As I discuss in Parts I and II of this book, the best way to reduce 
the risk of investing in stocks is to diversify your holdings not only in a vari-
ety of stocks but also in other investments that don’t move in tandem with 
the stock market.
Kiyosaki claims that he invests with the benefit of insurance when investing 
in real estate. He says, “My banker requires me to have insurance from cata-
strophic losses.” This is a nonsensical comparison because such an insur-
ance policy would cover losses from say, a fire, but not a decline in market 

384
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
value of the real estate due to overall market conditions. Interestingly, 
Kiyosaki followers got clobbered by shunning stocks, which rose sharply in 
the mid-2000s, and piling into real estate, which leveled off and then dropped 
sharply in most areas.
(Re-)Read Chapters 4 and 5
When the going gets tough in the stock market, you can easily lose perspec-
tive. Even if you’ve already read them, please go back and read Chapters 4 
and 5 again. These chapters explain how the stock market works and what 
influences stock prices in the short term versus the longer term. Be sure 
that you have the long-term perspective that you need to succeed with stock 
investing and that you really understand how the financial markets work.
Talk to People Who Care about You
Life’s challenging events can be humbling and sometimes depressing. Holding 
an investment that’s dropped a lot in value — whether it’s a stock, mutual 
fund, real estate, or small business — is one such event. But you don’t have to 
carry the burden yourself. Talk about your feelings with someone who under-
stands and cares about you. Be clear about and communicate what you’re 
seeking — empathy, good listening, a sounding board, or advice.
