Welcome to the Tiling section, this part of the guide will take 
you through the process of replacing a broken tile.  
 
 
To complete this task you will need the following items: 
• 
Replacement tile/tiles  
• 
Tile Adhesive  
• 
Tile grout (ready mixed is easier)  
• 
Masking tape  
• 
Electric drill with 5mm masonry bit  
• 
Cold chisel  
• 
Wood chisel  
• 
Tile adhesive spreader  
• 
Tile Spacers  
• 
Grout spreader  
• 
Grout rake  
• 
Plastic grout finishing tool  
• 
Safety goggles, appropriate work 
gloves  
 
 
 
When working with ceramic tiles always wear safety goggles and thick 
work gloves ! 
 
Place the masking tape in two strips diagonally to 
form an X shape on the tile as shown in Fig 1.1  
 
Using the 5mm bit drill holes at intervals along each 
strip of masking tape as shown in Fig 1.2 this will 
help stop the drill bit slipping, only drill the depth of 
the tile, you could wrap a piece of masking tape 
around the drill bit at the required depth to use as a 
guide.  
 
Next using the grout rake remove all the old grout 
from around the tile, ensuring not to damage the 
surrounding tiles.  
 
Now get your cold chisel and hammer and chip 
away at the tile starting from the middle and work 
your way out to the edges along the masking tape.  
 
Next remove the masking tape, you may find that 
most of the tile comes away with the tape, use the 
wood chisel bevel side down to remove any bits of 
tile that are left taking care not to damage the 
surrounding tiles. When you have removed all of 
the tile remove any old grout that may be left.

Now gently remove the old tile adhesive from the 
wall taking care not to slip with the chisel (see Fig 
1.3) and damage any of the other tiles, leave 
yourself with a nice flat surface for applying the tile 
adhesive.  
 
To give yourself a guide place the tile into the space 
to see if it fits and to make sure it is even, if the tile 
rocks then the surface is not even. This will also 
give a guide as to how much tile adhesive will need 
to be applied. 
 
Next take the replacement tile and apply the 
adhesive to the back of the tile using the adhesive 
spreader, use sparingly as the tile has to sit flush. 
 
Now carefully put the tile into place, making sure all 
sides/corners are flush with the surrounding tiles. 
When you are happy that the tile is flush, clean all 
adhesive from the face of the tile and the 
surrounding areas.  
 
Fig 1.3  
Use your tile spacers to get an even spacing around 
the tile as shown if Fig 1.4 and leave for 24 hours 
or however long the tile adhesive manufacturer 
recommends. 
 
Once the tile is securely fixed in position remove 
the tile spacers and grout around the tile. Use your 
plastic grout finishing tool to give the grout a 
smooth finish. 
 
When the grout has dried simply polish off with a 
dry cloth.
