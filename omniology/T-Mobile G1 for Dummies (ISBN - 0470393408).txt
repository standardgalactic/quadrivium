About the Author
Chris Ziegler is a mobile enthusiast who can rarely be spotted using the 
same phone twice. Although his passions include driving, fl ying, motorcycling, 
and pretty much anything that involves gasoline, he’s usually piloting 
nothing more than his own computer as Associate Mobile Editor for the 
technology blog Engadget. A native of Michigan, he currently lives in Chicago 
with two Macs, two PCs, and a pile of portable gizmos taller than he.
Dedication
To my fantastic parents, Brenda and Zig, for being far more patient and 
understanding than a son could ever ask a mother and father to be. I’d also 
like to thank Ryan Block for taking a chance on an unknown who’d never 
written a line of prose in his life; he put my career on a wild new path.
Acknowledgments
A world of thanks goes to Kyle Looper, my acquisitions editor, for reach-
ing out to Engadget to make this book happen; to Susan Pink, my editor, for 
reminding me that readers don’t always know what I’m talking about when I 
refer to it (and for so much more); to Andrew Hilsher, my technical editor, 
for making sure I know what the heck I’m talking about; to Peter Rojas for 
connecting me with Kyle; and to everyone at Wiley Publishing who’s helped 
to put T-Mobile G1 For Dummies on the bookshelf. It’s been quite a ride.

Introduction
I
’d like to take this opportunity to welcome you to T-Mobile G1 For 
Dummies. Regardless of whether you have recently purchased a G1 and 
need help getting started, are a seasoned professional looking for a quick 
refresher, are considering purchasing a G1 and would like to get a feel for 
what the device is all about, or just need to know what a G1 is, you’ve come 
to the right place.
In a nutshell, the G1 is a state-of-the-art cellphone developed by Google, 
HTC, and T-Mobile that features an expansive touch screen, a full keyboard, 
navigation capabilities, and a whole lot more. It connects to both Wi-Fi 
networks (like those found in homes and offices) and also to T-Mobile’s 
own high-speed data network to offer you speedy access to e-mail and the 
Web no matter where you happen to be.
Of course, a phone as amazing and feature-packed as the G1 is far more than 
just a phone — it’s an administrative assistant, a PC away from your PC, a 
movie theater, a jukebox, a mobile office, a gaming partner, and pretty much 
everything in between. This book shows you how to integrate the G1 into 
every part of your life (or only some parts, if you prefer!) and how to get the 
most out of it every step of the way.
The G1 is also the very first phone to be released using Google’s Android 
software, which is a standard operating system that many phones from 
different manufacturers and wireless carriers will use. This approach has 
several notable advantages, but most importantly, it means you’ll be able 
to take much of the knowledge you discover throughout your journey 
with the G1 with you should you move to other Android devices down 
the road. Standardization: Anyone who’s migrated between several 
BlackBerrys, Windows Mobile devices, or even Windows-based PCs will be 
able to appreciate the benefit of that!
I cover the fundamentals of Android and the G1, but I also show you great 
tips and tricks along the way. Read the book cover to cover if you like, or 
read just the sections that interest you most — either way, you can expect 
to find some cool tidbits that make the G1 an even handier gadget than you 
thought it was.

T-Mobile G1 For Dummies 
About This Book
T-Mobile G1 For Dummies can be read from beginning to end, either with or 
without a G1 in front of you. If you happen to have a G1 handy, that’s great 
because you’ll be able to follow along with the many examples. But if you 
don’t have a G1, you’ll end up with a great idea of how it works for both 
simple and more complex tasks. (You can think of this book as the ultimate 
buyer’s guide!)
The book also makes a great reference that you can quickly consult time 
and time again. And because the G1 runs the standard Android platform, 
many of the book’s concepts will remain useful if you decide to move on 
to another Android-based phone in the future. Who knows — you could be 
passing T-Mobile G1 For Dummies down to your great-grandkids someday.
Conventions Used in This Book
Here are some conventions I hope you’ll find useful:
 
✓ The G1 has buttons below the screen. When I ask you to push a button, 
I am referring to one of these buttons on the phone.
 
✓ The G1’s screen will show icons at times. If I want you to activate an 
icon, I ask you to touch it.
 
✓ You can swipe the G1’s screen by moving your finger across it. I’ll 
occasionally ask you to swipe to perform an action on the G1.
 
✓ Flicking is similar to swiping but your finger loses contact with the 
screen while your finger is still in motion. Flicking causes the G1’s 
screen to continue scrolling for a bit — handy for rapidly moving 
through pages of information.
 
✓ The keyboard that comes with the phone has, well, keys. You press 
a key.
What You’re Not to Read
If you’ve already powered on your G1, connected it to your Google account, 
and feel comfortable with the basics of navigating between screens and 
screen items, you can safely skip Chapters 1, 2, and 3. If you feel comfortable 
with call handling and text messaging, that means you’re ready to dive into 
the G1’s applications, and you can move right past Chapter 4.

 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
Because you bought this book, I figure that you fall into one of three 
categories: 
 
✓ You’ve already purchased a G1. Now you’re looking to maximize your 
investment, find out a little more about what Android’s all about, and 
pick up a few tips and tricks along the way. If so, congratulations — 
by choosing this book, you’ve made two smart choices! 
 
✓ You haven’t taken the plunge yet but want to find out more about 
whether Android and the G1 are right for you. I call the members of 
this group the “on-the-fencers.” This book does an excellent job of 
spelling out Android’s capabilities and how the G1 can fit into your life 
with its advanced e-mail capabilities, Web browsing, music support, 
and much more.
 
✓ You don’t know enough to recognize what Android is but do realize 
that what’s good in your PC must be good in your pocket, too. It turns 
out that you’re absolutely right!
Regardless of what category you are in, you need an answer to a burning 
question: What does Android offer you? I’m going to try my best to get 
that answer to you in this book, and to start, it helps to understand where 
Android came from, what it is, and where it’s going. I’m going to explore 
all that great stuff in Chapter 1. And don’t worry — you’ll be checking Gmail 
like a pro on your G1 in no time!
How This Book Is Organized
T-Mobile G1 For Dummies is organized into five themed parts, and each part 
is further subdivided into chapters covering individual topics.
Part I: Introducing Android 
and the T-Mobile G1
Part I goes over the fundamentals by describing what Android is all about, 
why it’s good for you, and how it ties into the G1. You find out about the G1’s 
physical features, its capabilities, and how to make your first phone call. This 
is a great place to start if you’re brand-new to the phone or trying to decide 
whether to take the plunge.

T-Mobile G1 For Dummies 
Part II: Putting the “Google” 
in Google Android
Google was deeply involved in the creation of the G1 and its software, and 
Part II goes over the fruit of that labor. All the things you love about Google 
on your desktop are in here: Gmail and Contacts, searching the Internet, 
Google Maps, Calendar, and more. Be careful, though — Google Maps on 
the G1 is a fun and extremely addicting pastime, so you could be spending a 
while on this part just for kicks!
Part III: Making the G1 
a Part of Your Life
Part III shows you how the G1 can become a true mobile companion, putting 
music, pictures, and a great Web browsing experience right in your pocket. 
I also take a look at the IM application for keeping in touch with friends 
using instant messaging accounts, YouTube for accessing a vast library of 
entertaining videos on the go, and — for truly customizing the G1 and making 
it your own — the Settings application.
Part IV: Adding Software and Media
In Part IV, I show you how the G1 manages your data. You see how to add 
to your phone the music that’s already have on your computer. In fact, the 
G1’s music capabilities are so well-honed that it includes the Amazon MP3 
program so you can purchase new tracks right on the device. (I show you 
how to use it, but keeping your spending in check is up to you!) I also get into 
Android’s management of applications that you might install, how to delete 
them, and how to effortlessly get new applications through the Android 
Market.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V gets into some must-have apps, games, and accessories that’ll make 
your G1 experience even cooler than it already is. I also throw in some sites 
you can visit to find out more about all the happenings in the fast-paced 
world of Android.

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
 
These are the time-savers and the eye-wideners. Watch for Tip icons to 
discover neat features, functions, and capabilities of your G1 that many users 
may not know.
 
When you put down T-Mobile G1 For Dummies, are you going to remember 
everything you’ve read verbatim? No, probably not. In fact, I’d be concerned if 
you did! These icons point out key takeaways that you’ll want to put in your 
back pocket because you’re likely to run into them down the road.
 
Take heed when you see one of these icons because the advice you find here 
could save you from some strife.
Where to Go from Here
Are you ready to read up on the most powerful phone you’ve ever seen? If so, 
let’s move right into Chapter 1 without further ado, where you’ll find out a 
little about the history of Android, what makes Android so cool, and why the 
future’s looking bright for the T-Mobile G1.

In this part . . .
G
enerally speaking, the best way to master a smart-
phone like the G1 isn’t to dive right into the music 
player. (Well, maybe it’s the best way if you’re really into 
Depeche Mode and not so much into making phone calls, 
but I’m trying to cover the majority here.) I get things off 
on the right foot by talking a little bit about Android’s 
past, present, and future in Chapter 1 and showing you 
the G1’s physical features in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, you 
find out about the Home screen (as the name implies, 
you’ll see this screen a lot). I wrap things up in Chapter 4 
with a thorough discussion of calling and text messaging.

F
ew companies in the world enjoy the overwhelming name recognition 
that Google does. And why shouldn’t it? Many people consider Google’s 
Web search to be the gateway to the Internet itself, a portal to absolutely 
anything they’re looking to find. Google applications (Gmail, YouTube, 
Google Talk, Documents — the list goes on) are often essential tools for 
business and pleasure alike. Indeed, chances are good that you and people 
you know have their browser’s home page set to www.google.com.
For many people, e-mail and the Web are essential elements in their 
daily lives. And now we can add a new addiction to another marvel of 
technology — a marvel whose sophistication and dominance now rival 
that of the Internet itself — the cellphone. This diminutive device travels 
everywhere to keep people connected to friends, family, and (unfortunately) 
the office. In some cases the cellphone has taken the place of the old-
fashioned wired telephone line. Modern cellphones rival the computing 
power of full-fledged desktop computers from just a decade ago, and 
some data services make it possible to use the Internet on a cellphone at 
speeds that give at-home broadband connections a run for their money. 
The possibilities are endless.
 
So what is Android? (Drumroll, please.) It’s a Linux-based smartphone 
operating system that can run on all sorts of phones. It just so happens to be 
a particularly cool operating system with some interesting features and an 
incredible cross-section of industry and community support. At its core, 
however, Android is simply an operating system.

10
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
More importantly, Android is the operating system that powers the T-Mobile 
G1 — in fact, the G1 is the very first Android-powered phone to be sold any-
where in the world! For you, that means your wireless companion benefits 
from everything Android has to offer. Hang on — it’s going to be a fun ride.
Unveiling Android the Google Way
For some time, Google has recognized the power of the cellphone. In fact, 
did you know that Google has tailored versions of its home page for different 
devices? It also makes mobile Gmail, Maps, and other programs available 
for free to users of a variety of phone models. Any iPhone owner can tell 
you how helpful Google Maps is in your pocket or purse — especially when 
you’re trying to track down the address of that killer Chinese restaurant 
across town.
But, like any good company, Google isn’t content to rest on its laurels. 
Making a Web page that fits on your cellphone’s screen is a worthy task, 
but Google knew that it could do more. In 2005, it purchased Android, a 
Silicon Valley start-up company that had been quietly and secretively work-
ing on creating software for the next generation of cellphones. The company 
continued working in stealth mode under Mother Google’s watchful eye until 
November 2007, when Android was officially unveiled to the world.
Google makes Android available for free, like most of its products. At first 
glance, this doesn’t seem like a healthy way to turn a profit, but Google has 
a plan. The company recognizes the importance of cellphones (and more 
generally, anything that fits in a pocket and can connect to the Internet) in its 
business strategy in the coming years; with Android, the company has its 
own platform for deploying Google-branded services without having to deal 
with other vendors.
 
Google looks at Android as yet another way to suck you into the bountiful 
Google ecosystem of products and keep you there — and for anyone using 
Gmail or Maps on a daily basis, that’s not a bad thing at all.
What Android Is (and Is Not)
Just like your desktop or laptop computer, your cellphone — no matter how 
big or small — runs an operating system. The operating system is the brain 
of your phone: the software that “talks” to the phone’s processor and other 
hardware, manages memory (you have to put those ringtones somewhere, 
right?), and allows applications (such as mobile Web and e-mail apps, music 
players, and games) to do their thing.

11
 Chapter 1: Google: What’s Good in Your PC Is Good in Your Pocket
This tiny operating system varies significantly from phone to phone and 
from manufacturer to manufacturer. Cellphones broadly fall into one of two 
categories based on the kind of operating system they use: plain ol’ phones, 
which are sometimes playfully called dumbphones, and smartphones, which 
can be expanded. The line between the two is blurry and can change slightly 
depending on who you ask, but the distinction is important nonetheless.
The dumbphone
Regular phones are devices built from the ground up with a certain set of 
capabilities in mind, and the options for expansion beyond that are limited. 
In a way, you can think of their operating system as a walled fortress with no 
entrance or exit; the manufacturer (sometimes in cahoots with your wireless 
carrier) decided what software would be allowed to run when the phone 
was created, and that’s that. You may have limited capability to add games 
or small applications, but these items are usually limited in what they can do 
because the operating system restricts them.
You might be saying “Down with dumbphones, then — let’s move on to the 
good stuff!” Hold on for just a second, though; it’s not all doom and gloom. 
Most phones sold today, such as the Motorola RAZR and LG Chocolate 
series, are in this category, and just because their capability for expansion is 
limited doesn’t mean they’re not already capable devices. Here are some 
dumbphone advantages:
 
✓ They’re connected: Many modern phones have support for e-mail; 
have full Web browsers; and can feed you with weather, news, sports 
scores, and more.
 
✓ They keep you entertained: Frequently, these phones offer music 
players, games, powerful cameras, and video playback.
 
✓ They just work: Because you can’t install just any old application you 
want on these devices, they tend to be more stable and less buggy than 
smartphones. The manufacturer and network carriers can test every 
conceivable configuration of the software before it’s sold to you and me.
See, dumbphones aren’t so bad!
The smartphone
A smartphone is simply a cellphone with a standard operating system and a 
capability to create and install new programs. It frequently features advanced 
input systems, such as QWERTY keypads or large touch screens, and impres-
sive features such as integrated GPS for mapping your location and Wi-Fi 
networking for speedy Web browsing and e-mail access. And, just like the 

12
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
PDAs of yore, smartphones with the same operating system are often avail-
able from multiple manufacturers, making it easier to select the hardware 
that meets your needs and preferences.
At the end of the day, dumbphones are limited in what they can and cannot 
do, and that’s what ultimately drove the creation of the smartphone. You 
can think of the smartphone as the spiritual successor to the personal 
digital assistant (PDA) — the Apple Newtons and Palm Pilots of the 1990s — 
combining a PDA’s capabilities with a phone into a single, pocketable bundle 
of convenience.
This list describes a couple of benefits that made those PDAs so useful:
 
✓ They were “open” for development. Hobbyists and giant corporations 
alike could create their own software for the devices and then distribute 
those applications to the world. If you wanted a better note-taking 
program, for example, odds are someone had already created one that 
you could buy or, in some cases, download for free.
 
✓ The experiences were consistent across devices. If you didn’t like 
Palm’s hardware, you could go buy a Sony Clié — but you didn’t have 
to relearn everything about using it because it still used the Palm OS. 
Similarly, you could switch between a Casio Cassiopeia, an HP Jornada, 
and a Compaq iPAQ with aplomb because they all ran Microsoft’s Pocket 
PC platform.
It wasn’t all fun and games, though. Early smartphones, such as Handspring’s 
Treo 180 and 270, were compromises. They were neither great PDAs nor 
stellar phones, frequently forcing users to purchase separate, dedicated, 
simpler dumbphones for those times when PDA functionality wasn’t 
necessary to have around.
Over time, though, manufacturers have expertly and seamlessly integrated 
the two devices into a single experience. Battery life is less of an issue than 
it ever has been (although, to be honest, there’s no such thing as too much 
battery life). The inclusion of sophisticated word processing, spreadsheet, 
and presentation applications have made it possible to take short business 
trips without hauling the laptop along. In fact, smartphones — once designed 
for and used almost exclusively by businesspeople — have become so easy 
and fun to use that they’re now frequently marketed to and used by college 
students, stay-at-home parents, and everyone in between.
And then came Android and the G1
Historically, the still-young smartphone operating system market has 
been dominated by heavyweights Windows Mobile (owned by Microsoft), 
Symbian (supported by a consortium of phone manufacturers), and 

13
 Chapter 1: Google: What’s Good in Your PC Is Good in Your Pocket
BlackBerry OS (owned by RIM), with the Apple iPhone’s special flavor of 
Mac OS X more recently shaking the boat. Smartphones are really nothing 
more than pocket-sized computers, and to a certain extent, the software 
reflects this: Windows Mobile is a scaled-down version of Windows, and the 
iPhone runs a lightweight version of the Mac’s operating system.
Hmm — Windows and Mac. I sense a pattern here. Sure enough, the same 
fight for operating system dominance in the PC industry is being waged 
on a smaller scale on your cellphone. Linux is in the thick of things, too, 
although no one has managed to create a popular, widely used smartphone 
operating system that’s based on it — and that’s where the Android-powered 
G1 comes in.
Recognizing What Makes 
Android Unique
With established players such as Windows Mobile already running on all 
sorts of great, capable phones in the marketplace, fair questions to ask are, 
“What makes Android any different, and why would you choose it?” Or if you 
work in an organization where the G1 was provided to you, you might be 
wondering why they chose it?
First, I want to get the “X factor” out of the way — that subjective preference 
for one product’s look, feel, and reputation over another’s that has separated 
Mac users from PC users, Ford buyers from Chevy buyers, and Spartans from 
Athenians for thousands of years. Similarly, some die-hard BlackBerry users 
cannot be convinced that an Android phone such as the G1 could ever do the 
job, and hey, that’s just fine. Different strokes for different folks, I always say.
Here are some of the unique features that set Android apart:
 
✓ Android is tightly integrated with Google products. One great thing 
Android has going for it is its extremely (and I do mean extremely) tight 
integration with much of what Google has to offer. For true Google 
junkies, this integration could be a deciding factor. Sure, Google offers 
many of its services to other devices, but none can claim to ooze 
Google from every nook and cranny the way an Android device does. 
As an example, Google Maps offers an almost desktop-like experience 
on Android, right down to Street View support. And the G1 offers one 
advantage that Google Maps on your desktop never can: You can take it 
with you.

14
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
 
✓ Android is thoroughly modern. It’s the only mainstream smartphone 
operating system out there now with that new-software smell. It may 
be an unfair advantage, but as the new kid on the block, Android inher-
ently gets to lay claim to the title. In practical terms, this doesn’t mean 
terribly much, but you can expect Android to be best equipped to take 
advantage of today’s most advanced mobile hardware — like the G1, 
for instance.
 
✓ Android enjoys massive support from the developer community. 
In other words, if you are looking to add a particular application to 
your phone, odds are very good that the app already exists, is under 
development, or at the very least is on a developer’s mind somewhere 
in the world.
The list doesn’t stop there, though. Like Windows Mobile, Android enjoys a 
terrific level of device independence, meaning that you can expect to see it 
running on all sorts of phones from different manufacturers soon. Believe 
it or not, that’s a great thing for you and your G1: The more people who are 
using Android, the more companies that will embrace it — and that means 
more software and more support for everyone.
From an employer’s perspective, there’s a lot to love about Android, too. 
Android-powered phones will eventually offer true support for Exchange 
Servers, the Microsoft-supplied e-mail and scheduling systems used by many 
of the world’s companies. Google also allows manufacturers and carriers 
to lock down their phones, meaning they can be configured so that no 
additional software can be added without approval: This restriction is no 
fun for the user, granted, but it avoids a potential support nightmare for 
companies looking to deploy hundreds or thousands of units.
Adding the Hardware Component
As huge as Google is, it still can’t act unilaterally. No company in the world 
can create a brand-new smartphone platform and expect phones using it to 
magically will themselves into existence. Far from it, in fact; it takes a small 
army of big names to give an initiative such as Android a fighting chance in a 
world dominated by Microsoft and Apple — and a small army is exactly what 
Google has cobbled together.
The Open Handset Alliance
If Android itself is the king showing on the table, the Open Handset Alliance 
(OHA) might be the ace up Google’s sleeve. Concurrently with Android’s 
announcement in 2007, Google revealed that it had already secretly 
convinced tens upon tens of the world’s largest manufacturers, network 

15
 Chapter 1: Google: What’s Good in Your PC Is Good in Your Pocket
operators, and software companies to sign up and support it. Together, 
this consortium makes up the OHA, whose primary function is to evangelize 
Android as a platform and steer its future direction and development.
Some important companies are involved with the Open Handset Alliance, 
which bodes well for Android’s future. This list gives you a closer look at 
some of these players and their involvement in the alliance:
 
✓ Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile: T-Mobile has been an enthusiastic sup-
porter of Android since day one, as evidenced by the fact that it has 
brought the first Android device in the world to market. Fellow U.S. 
carrier Sprint Nextel is also in the OHA, so it’s likely that they’ll be 
offering their own Android-powered phones before too long as well. So 
what about AT&T and Verizon? Both have both expressed interest in 
Android without fully committing to the OHA, so it’s possible they’ll be 
offering devices as well.
 
✓ NTT DoCoMo: Though most of us have never used an NTT DoCoMo 
phone, the carrier is Japan’s largest, meaning it oversees one of the 
world’s most advanced mobile phone networks. Its involvement bodes 
well for the creation of extremely powerful and creatively designed 
Android handsets, though you may need to be in the Land of the Rising 
Sun to use them!
 
✓ China Mobile: This carrier is China’s largest — which, as you might 
imagine, also makes it the world’s largest with close to 400 million 
subscribers, greater than the population of the United States. There’s 
no telling what sorts of Android devices China Mobile might launch, 
but it can mean only good things to have the world’s biggest carrier on 
your side.
 
✓ HTC: The HTC name may not be familiar, but it’s a huge Windows 
Mobile licensee, and odds are you’ve seen, used, or owned one or more 
devices created with HTC’s involvement. If you have a G1 in front of you 
right now, you definitely have! AT&T Tilt, Sprint Touch Diamond, and 
T-Mobile Dash and Wing are other examples of devices manufactured by 
HTC. Historically, HTC has sold only phones running Windows Mobile, 
so adding Android to its stable is a big deal.
 
✓ LG, Motorola, and Samsung: Together, these three phone manufactur-
ers account for more than a third of all cellphones sold globally. That’s 
a lot of talking!
Why the T-Mobile G1 is important
The T-Mobile G1 is important because you’re using it, of course, but other 
forces are at play here, too. As the first retail Android phone to be sold 
anywhere, the G1 is an important showcase for the technology and a critical 
way to get people exposed to everything that makes Android great.

16
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
The fact that a major carrier like T-Mobile and a huge manufacturer like HTC 
jumped headfirst into the Android pool to produce the G1 speaks volumes 
about the industry’s level of commitment to what Google has managed to do. 
There are hundreds of good reasons for their enthusiasm, and I’ll be walking 
you through a good number of them.

A
s powerful as the G1 is, you’ll be delighted to find that applying power 
to your little beast and navigating its primary functions really couldn’t 
be any easier. If you’re already using a cellphone — any cellphone — 
several buttons, concepts, and functions will already be familiar to you. 
And all G1-specific features are intuitive.
In this chapter, you find out about the physical features of the G1. Next, you 
power on your phone for the first time, unless you’ve cheated and already 
done so — I can’t say I blame you! Then I walk you through making a phone 
call — this is a phone after all — and handling incoming calls.
Android Anatomy
Let’s begin by taking a look at some of the physical features of the T-Mobile 
G1 in Figures 2-1 and 2-2. Here are the highlights (keep in mind that Android-
powered phones that come to market in the future will share many of these 
same features, so it’ll be a snap to make the transition if you change devices):

✓ Touch-sensitive display: The display is your phone’s main way of con-
veying information to you. Because the display can register the touch of 
your finger, you’ll frequently find it convenient to navigate the phone’s 
screens and menus this way.
 
 
The touch screen relies on contact with skin to function, so you won’t 
be able to use a stylus or fingernail (or wear gloves or mittens) to oper-
ate it.
 
✓ Menu button: Pushing this button once will bring up the most com-
monly used commands and features for the application you are cur-
rently using. Pushing it again hides them.
 
 Conveniently, the G1 has also added a Menu key to the keyboard, so 
there’s no need to stretch your weary right thumb to reach the Menu 
button if you happen to be typing and need access to the current appli-
cation’s options!
 
✓ Send button: If you’ve used another cellphone in the past, you probably 
know what this one is all about — you use it to answer or place calls. 
By holding this button down for a moment, you can use it also to dial by 
voice, a feature I discuss in Chapter 4.
 
✓ Home button: This button gets you to Android’s Home screen in a hurry. 
Windows users might think of this as the Show Desktop command.

19
 Chapter 2: Powering On and Getting Around
 
Figure 2-2:

Pushing and holding Home for slightly longer will show you a task 
switcher that allows you to select from the last six running applications 
(see Figure 2-3). This is surprisingly handy! It’s not uncommon to need 
to switch between two or three apps at a time — whether it be on your 
PC or your G1 — and this app switcher allows you to do that without 
constantly returning to the Home screen.
 
✓ Trackball: Like many modern BlackBerry devices, the G1 uses a track-
ball for navigating around the screen and selecting items. The trackball 
is an alternative to the touch screen itself, which might be more conve-
nient depending on how you’re holding the phone.
 
✓ Back button: This button always returns you to where you just were 
before you arrived at the current screen. If you’ve opened a menu, 
pushing Back closes it; if you’ve opened an application from the Home 
screen, pushing Back brings you back home.
 
✓ End button: Like the Send button, users of other cellphones will feel 
right at home with End. If you are currently on a call, pushing End 
terminates it. If you are not on a call, pushing End puts your phone to 
sleep, and holding down End gives you additional options. I discuss all 
of these shortly.

20
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
 
Figure 2-3: 
The task 
switcher.
 
 
✓ QWERTY keyboard: Not everything you do on your phone requires 
lengthy text input, but when you’re writing a long e-mail message, spruc-
ing up a report, or jotting down a novella, nothing beats a full QWERTY 
keyboard like the one on your PC (except a heck of a lot smaller). Simply 
slide the display to reveal it.
 
✓ Volume buttons: Like many phones, the volume buttons adjust your 
ringer volume when you are not on a call and the earpiece volume when 
you are on a call.
 
✓ Camera button: Pushing and holding the camera button momentarily 
opens the Camera application, which is a nice shortcut for avoiding the 
trek through the Applications tab when you want to take a picture. I take 
a close look at the G1’s photographic skills in Chapter 11.
Touch-sensitive display
Touching the display is a key part of the Android experience. Google left 
nothing to chance and also included support for trackballs and other physi-
cal controls, but you’ll likely find that you touch the display most of the time.
 
Throughout this book, I refer to touches and swipes. A touch, as you might 
expect, simply means touching an item on the display. A swipe occurs when 
you touch the screen, hold your finger down, and move it to another part of 
the screen in one fluid motion.

21
 Chapter 2: Powering On and Getting Around
What’s the function of a swipe, you ask? It’s used to move an object (say, a 
menu) from one location to another. It sounds awkward, but it’s intuitive once 
you’ve used it. Say you have a piece of paper on a table; to move it, you’d just 
press down on it and move your finger. If you wanted to move it faster and far-
ther, you might flick your finger, let go, and watch the paper keep going. Android 
supports both types of swipes, and you’ll be mastering them in no time.
The trackball
As fun, easy, and effective as touching the display is, sometimes using a more 
traditional way of getting around Android makes sense. Your G1 features a 
trackball for this purpose; just roll the ball up, down, left, or right with your 
finger to navigate.
 
When you’re using the trackball, a highlight appears on the screen to indicate 
what’s currently selected. Once you’ve selected what you want (a menu item, 
for example), you press the trackball to activate it.
Turning on the G1 for the First Time
The first time you turn on your G1, you’ll go through some extra fanfare that 
you won’t need to worry about ever again (unless you intentionally clear the 
phone’s memory or want to change Google accounts). Just follow the quick 
instructions on the screen. The entire process doesn’t take but a minute or 
two of your time and then you’re on your way.
So, what are these extra steps all about? Because Android is so tightly inte-
grated with Google’s services, your phone requires you to have a Google 
account associated with it at all times, and you’ll be asked to get this account 
configured when the phone first turns on.
 
Keep in mind that your Gmail login is your Google account, so if you already 
use Gmail, you’re in the door — just use that login information here. Don’t 
have a Gmail account (or any other Google account)? No biggie — you can 
create one right from the G1. Just touch the Create icon during the initial 
setup process to get started.
Requiring a Google account to use the G1 has numerous advantages; for 
example, Gmail, Calendar, Contacts, and Google Talk are all automatically 
configured for you as soon as you finish entering your account information. 
What’s more, if you already use Google services on your PC to manage your 
contacts and calendar, your information will automatically start downloading 
to your phone; after a few minutes, it’ll all be there! Even better, any future 
changes you make from your PC or your phone will be synchronized without 
any intervention on your part.

22
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
 
Because your phone is perpetually tied to a Google account, your most impor-
tant information — your calendar, contacts, and e-mail — are effectively 
backed up to Google’s servers on a continual basis. Rest easy!
Feels Like the First Time: Resetting 
Your G1 and Deleting Its Memory
If you need to change the Google account associated with your G1 or you’re 
giving it to someone else (the horror!), you’ll want to hard reset it. This proce-
dure clears its internal memory and makes it “forget” your Google account so 
that someone can enter a new account. To perform this operation:
 
1. Turn off the G1.
 
2. Push and hold down the End button until a pop-up menu appears 
(see Figure 2-4). Choose Power off, and then touch OK.
 
Figure 2-4: 
The Phone 
options

accessible 
by pushing 
and holding 
the End 
button.
 
 
3. Push and hold both the Home and Back buttons.
 
4. While continuing to hold Home and Back, turn on the phone by push-
ing and releasing End.
 
 Keep holding Home and Back — you’re almost there! After a brief self-test 
(you’ll see a lot of pretty colors), a message appears warning you that “this 
operation will delete all your personal data, and reset all settings to manu-
facturer default.” In other words, all your stuff will be gone from the phone.

23
 Chapter 2: Powering On and Getting Around
 
5. Release the Home and Back buttons.
 
6. Push the Send button to go ahead with the hard reset operation, or 
press anything else to cancel it and power on the G1 normally.
 
Although you can always hard reset your G1 and enter in the same Google 
account you were using before to restore your contacts, calendar, and Gmail 
data from Google’s servers, anything else — applications you’ve installed, for 
example — will be gone. Perform this operation only if you’re really sure you 
want to do it.
Changing the Battery
If you’re able to charge your G1 every night and you sell (or recycle) the 
phone within two or three years of purchasing it, you may never need to 
worry about changing the battery. However, if you find that you’re on the 
phone, browsing the Web, or checking your e-mail for several hours during 
the day without access to a wall outlet — or the time to use it — you might 
be well-served to carry a spare battery that can be purchased from T-Mobile 
or a number of online retailers. When you’re in a pinch and the G1 is about to 
use its last drop of juice, you can just power down, swap in the spare battery, 
and be on your merry way.
You’ll also find that the battery loses its ability to hold a good charge over 
time — anyone who’s used a laptop computer with the same battery for a few 
years is probably familiar with this phenomenon. If you find that you can’t 
ever get a full day’s use out of the phone when you’re not using it heavily, 
you know that it’s time to replace the battery.
Changing the battery is pretty simple:
 
1. Shut off the phone.
 
2. Open the keyboard.
 
 To the left of the keys, you’ll notice a crack in the plastic. This is the top 
of the tab that holds the back cover in place.
 
3. With a fingernail, pull outward and down (toward the bottom of the 
phone) on the crack.
 
 Keep pulling! You’ll feel a little resistance, but don’t worry — you’re not 
breaking anything. If you’re doing it correctly, the entire backside of the 
G1 is coming off as you pull.
 
4. Once you’ve pulled the tab completely free of the phone, pull the 
back cover out of its tabs on the other end of the phone and set it 
aside.

24
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
 
 You’re now looking as the G1’s innards. In the center, the black object 
labeled HTC Innovation is the battery. (If you’ve already replaced the 
battery with a third-party model, it could be a different color and labeled 
differently.)
 
5. Using a fingernail, lift up on the battery’s tab.
 
 The top end of the battery has a small tab with a hole underneath it, 
which makes it easy to grab hold of the tab with a fingernail.
 
6. Pull the battery completely out of the phone and set it aside.
 
 At the bottom of the battery chamber, you will see three gold pins — 
these are the connections that allow the G1 to draw power from the 
battery.
 
7. Take the new battery and place its bottom end (the end with the gold 
squares on it) inside the G1’s battery chamber first, making sure that 
the gold squares line up with and touch the G1’s gold pins.
 
8. Drop the other end of the battery into the chamber and push down 
until the entire battery is flush with its surroundings — in other 
words, the battery shouldn’t be sticking up.
 
 Before you replace the cover, you can power on the phone to make sure 
that you’ve installed the battery correctly.
 
9. Align the bottom end of the cover (the end without the large tab) so 
that it’s touching the bottom end of the phone. (The tiny tabs on the 
cover should be in the phone.)
 
10. Rotate the cover into place and press on it until the large tab is back 
in its original position.
 
 As when removing the cover, you’ll feel some resistance here — that’s 
okay. Keep pressing until the tab is fully in place.
It sounds like a lot of work, but after you’ve done it a couple times, I promise 
that swapping the battery will be a cinch — you might even be able to do it 
standing up. Just don’t blame me if you drop anything!
Your First Phone Call
In the following simple example, I show you how to power on the phone and 
call a friend to talk about your exciting new purchase (or gift, if you’re lucky):
 
1. Push the End button.
 
 The End button doubles as the Power button — on the button, note the 
small power symbol below the handset symbol. After a moment, the 
display turns on. Your phone is coming to life! After the display turns on, 
you see a display similar to the one in Figure 2-5.

25
 Chapter 2: Powering On and Getting Around
 
Figure 2-5: 
The power-
on screen. 
 
 
2. Wait for the Home screen to be displayed.
 
 As its name suggests, the Home screen (see Figure 2-6) is your phone’s 
home base, not unlike the desktop on your PC. You see this screen when 
your phone turns on or when you push the Home button.
 
Figure 2-6: 
The Home 
screen.
 

26
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
 
3. Push the Send button.
 
 No matter which screen you’re looking at in your phone, pushing Send 
opens the Dialer application, which is a fancy way of saying “place your 
call here.”
 
4. Touch the Dialer tab at the top of the display.
 
 You can dial calls in several ways in a phone this sophisticated, but to 
start, we’ll keep it simple by dialing just like our ancestors did, by enter-
ing the phone number into a numeric keypad. That’s the function of the 
Dialer tab, shown in Figure 2-7: It’s a numeric keypad plus a display to 
see what you typed. Nothing more, nothing less.
 
Figure 2-7: 
The Dialer 
application 
with the 
Dialer tab 
selected.
 
 
5. With your finger, use the numeric keypad displayed on the screen to 
enter the number of your friend (or enemy, if you’re looking to make 
someone jealous).
 
6. Push Send.
That’s it! You should be sharing the news of your newly acquired gem of 
modern technology as you read this paragraph.
You probably noticed during your call that another screen appeared, giving 
you additional options and information — this is the call progress screen. 
Let’s take a look at it next.

27
 Chapter 2: Powering On and Getting Around
Call Handling
Android offers all the call handling options that you would expect in a 
modern cellphone. You can
 
✓ Swap calls: If you have two calls going at the same time, swapping 
between the two is just a matter of touching an icon.
 
✓ Merge calls: Bring two active calls together into a conference line.
 
✓ Add a call: Make a second phone call while keeping your first call on 
hold.
 
✓ Hold the call: This option allows you to place a caller on hold, but he or 
she won’t get any relaxing background music while waiting.
 
✓ Mute the call: This is similar to hold, but you can still hear the caller — 
they just can’t hear you.
 
✓ Enable the speakerphone: Did you know your G1 can function as a full-
fledged speakerphone? It’s great for an impromptu meeting around the 
lunch table, and it’s just a touch away.
Let’s say you’ve still got your friend on the line from the preceding section, 
and you’re still looking at the call progress screen — the place Android takes 
you during a phone call. (If you’ve already hung up, go ahead and call back — 
your friend won’t mind!) But now you’d like to add a second buddy into the 
conversation. With Android, it’s a piece of cake:
 
1. While in the call progress screen, push the Menu button.
 
 A grid of options available for the call appears at the bottom of the dis-
play, as shown in Figure 2-8.
 
2. Touch Add call.
 
 This returns you to the Dialer (you may recognize this screen from 
the call you placed earlier). As before, we’ll keep it simple by enter-
ing a number directly into the keypad using the Dialer tab at the top of 
the screen. And don’t worry — we’ll cover the rest of those tabs soon 
enough!
 
3. Using the Dialer tab, dial the second number and push the Send 
button.
 
 The call progress screen returns, but this time two boxes are shown. 
The uppermost box shows you the number you just called and displays 
“Call in Progress” below it, letting you know that this is the person 
you’re currently talking to. Below that, a second smaller box reminds 
you that you still have your first call on hold! Let’s rectify that.
 
4. Push the Menu button (or press the Menu key on the keyboard if that 
is more convenient).

28
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
 
Figure 2-8: 
Call options.
 
 
5. Touch Merge calls.
 
 A new box appears on the screen indicating that you are now in a con-
ference call.
Now, what if another friend wanders into the room while you’re having this 
lovely conversation? No problem — it’s easy to get the third person in on the 
call, too:
 
1. Push the Menu button or press the Menu key on the keyboard.
 
2. Touch Speaker.
 
 Note that the gray bar below the Speaker icon turns from gray to green, 
indicating that the G1’s speakerphone is enabled. The screen also holds 
a second clue: a new icon appears in the status bar to the left of the 
signal strength indicator (see Figure 2-9).

29
 Chapter 2: Powering On and Getting Around
 
In Android, the status bar is almost always visible. In case you leave the Dialer 
application while you’re still on a call, the status bar icon will still be there to 
remind you that everyone can hear you!
When you’ve finished your chat, just push the End button. Now, repeat the 
process until every one of your friends knows all about your fabulous G1. 
When you’re ready, I’ll be waiting for you in the next chapter.

Chapter 3
The Home Screen and Status Bar 
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out about shortcuts and widgets
▶ Navigating and organizing your Home screen
▶ Staying informed with the status bar
W
hen it comes to Android, there’s no place like home. No, seriously — 
you’ll be spending much of your time at your G1’s Home screen. Just 
like your PC’s desktop, the Home screen is a jumping-off point for everything 
that your device has to offer — but beyond that, it’s a full-fledged application 
unto itself that can keep you informed and entertained with a minimum of 
fuss.
In this chapter, I discuss in detail what the Home screen is all about, what it 
can do for you, and how you can customize it to make it your own. Then you 
take a look at the Home screen’s slimmer cousin, the status bar, which you’ll 
find in most of the screens that you encounter.
The Home Screen: Not Just for 
Checking the Time Anymore
Many people who carry average phones will tell you that their handset’s 
Home screen is good for one thing, and one thing only: checking the time. 
Yes, that’s an important function — especially as wristwatches become an 
ever rarer accessory — but with the G1, the beautiful clock is just the 
beginning.

32
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
Applications, shortcuts, and widgets
The Home screen holds three kinds of items:
 
✓ Applications: These are exactly as they sound. You can take any 
application on your phone and make an icon for it right on your Home 
screen, giving you quick and easy access to your most frequently used 
programs.
 
✓ Shortcuts: Think of shortcuts as files on your PC. Shortcuts are not 
applications but links to data within them. For example, you can create 
a Contact shortcut that links directly to a particular contact in the 
Contacts application or a Bookmark shortcut that opens a specified link 
in the Browser.
 
✓ Widgets: These might be the most interesting thing going on in the 
Home screen. Widgets, such as the Google search widget depicted in 
Figure 3-1, are tiny applications that live right on the Home screen and 
provide information or offer a bit of functionality without having to open 
a full-fledged app. These are equivalent to gadgets in Windows Vista 
or — you guessed it — widgets in Mac OS X.
 
Figure 3-1: 
The Google 
search 
widget.
 
 
The Home screen can accommodate all three kinds of items simultaneously, 
so don’t be afraid to experiment! A well-conceived layout that matches your 
personality and lifestyle can improve your productivity by shaving minutes of 
needless fiddling with your phone.
The default layout
Out of the box, Android’s default Home screen layout, shown in Figure 3-2, is 
useful without any customization.
The default layout provides the following:
 
✓ The status bar: You’ll find this little buddy on most of the screens in 
Android, giving you tidbits of information that you’ll always want access 
to. I dive into the status bar’s capabilities later in the chapter.

33
 Chapter 31: The Home Screen and Status Bar
 
✓ A large analog clock: This widget reminds me of the clocks in my 
elementary school classroom. It’s legible, looks great, and does a good 
job of making sure that I’m not tardy. The digital version is available just 
above in the status bar.
 
✓ myFaves, Dialer, Contacts, Browser, and Maps icons: If you’re signed 
up to a T-Mobile plan that includes myFaves, you’ll see an icon for it 
here — it appears automatically! Other than that, Google assumes that 
Dialer, Contacts, Browser, and Google Maps are the four applications 
you’ll be spending most of your time using (and it’s probably an accu-
rate guess), so it drops icons for them front and center on your Home 
screen.
 
✓ The Applications tab: This tab is the portal to your device’s library of 
applications. Unless you have an icon for a particular app on your Home 
screen, you’ll access the application from here.
 
Figure 3-2: 
The Home 
screen’s 
default 
layout.
 
Getting around the house
To select something on your Home screen, simply touch it or select it by 
pressing the trackball while it is highlighted. Different types of Home screen 
items react differently when you select them:
 
✓ Applications and shortcuts take you somewhere. For example, touching 
or selecting the Browser icon opens the Browser.
 
✓ Widgets may allow you to interact with them, they may take you some-
where, or they may do nothing at all. I discuss Widgets in a moment.

34
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
You can do more than select things you see on your Home screen, though. If 
you don’t see the application you want to open, expanding the Applications 
tab as in Figure 3-3 will reveal it (along with every other application installed 
on your phone).
 
Figure 3-3: 
The 
Applications 
tab 
expanded.
 
You can expand the Applications tab one of two ways: either touch and hold 
the tab and then physically drag it across the screen, or simply touch it 
briefly. To close the tab once it’s expanded, touch it again, or drag it in the 
opposite direction that you opened it.
By swiping the Home screen left or right, you reveal two additional but empty 
Home screens. They’re there simply to give you more room to add applica-
tions, shortcuts, and widgets that may not be important enough for the first 
page. These secondary pages are always just a swipe away.
 
The only thing that makes the primary Home screen “primary” is that it’s 
between the two secondary screens. That way, you can access either of your 
secondary screens when you are looking at your primary screen simply by 
swiping. From anywhere in Android, one push of the Home button takes you 
back to the last thing you were looking at on your Home screen, and two 
pushes of Home return you directly to your primary Home screen.
Making your house a Home
The default layout’s great, but who’s to say that Dialer, Browser, Contacts, 
and Maps are the four icons you want front and center? Let’s make a few 
changes to your Home screen.

35
 Chapter 31: The Home Screen and Status Bar
Change the wallpaper
First, let’s swap out that tired wallpaper for something a little more engaging:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
 The Home screen’s menu appears, as shown in Figure 3-4. Keep in mind 
you can always press the Menu key on the keyboard to accomplish the 
same task. 
 
Figure 3-4: 
The Home 
screen 
menu.
 
 
2. Press Wallpaper.
 
 You’re presented with a menu of wallpaper sources.
 
3. Press Wallpaper gallery.
 
 You see a viewer that allows you to quickly navigate and preview all the 
available wallpapers on your device. In this view, you can swipe the pic-
ture strip at the bottom to move it quickly to the right or left. The high-
lighted picture — which always appears in the middle of the strip — is 
shown magnified at the top of the display.
 
4. When you’ve settled on your new wallpaper, press Set wallpaper.
Remove an application icon
Looking better already! Next, remove the Dialer icon, since you can get to the 
Dialer application just as easily by pushing the Send button:
 
1. Touch and hold the Dialer icon.
 
 After a moment, the icon becomes larger and the phone briefly vibrates, 
indicating that the icon is ready to be moved to another location on 
the screen or deleted. The normal arrow icon on the Applications tab 
changes to a trash can icon, telling you that this is where you drag items 
you want to remove.
 
2. Without lifting your finger, drag the icon to the trash can icon and 
release.

36
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
The Dialer icon disappears, but don’t worry; the application itself is still 
there. You can access it by pushing Send or, like any application, by choos-
ing its icon in the expanded Applications tab. (You can also add a Dialer icon 
back to your Home screen at any time by holding down on the icon from the 
Applications tab and dragging it back out to the Home screen.) Deleting or 
moving around an application’s Home screen icon — similar to an alias in 
Mac OS or a shortcut in Windows — has no effect on the underlying program.
Move a widget
That clock might look a little better in the center of the screen, don’t you 
think? (Maybe not, but for the purposes of this exercise, just politely agree — 
it’s easy to change back, I promise!)
 
1. Touch and hold the clock.
 
 As with the Dialer icon, the clock becomes larger, indicating that it can 
be moved or deleted. You’ll also feel a quick, gentle vibration.
 
2. Drag the clock until you’re satisfied with its location.
 
3. Release your finger.
The clock stays where you left it, and because it won’t move without being 
first held down, it’s difficult to accidentally jostle it out of place.
Add an application icon
Next, let’s assume that you find yourself eating out a lot, so you simply must 
have quick access to a calculator to compute tips. Easy:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch Add.
 
 The different categories of items you can add to the Home screen 
appear. Besides the wallpaper you’ve previously selected, you can 
choose from applications, shortcuts, and widgets.
 
3. Touch Application.
 
4. Touch Calculator.
Now you have a Calculator icon right on your Home screen — perfect for all 
that number crunching you intend to do. 
You can add an application icon in another way, and this method gives you 
more control over the icon’s location:
 
1. Touch the Applications tab to expand it.
 
2. In the Applications tab, touch and hold the Calculator icon.
 
3. Drag away from the icon’s original location, making sure that your 
finger stays in contact with the screen.

37
 Chapter 31: The Home Screen and Status Bar
 
 A copy of the icon stays with your finger while the Applications tab 
closes.
 
4. Release your finger on the Home screen where you’d like the icon to 
appear.
Add a widget
Finally, let’s add a Google search widget (this is a Google Android phone, 
after all). There’s a problem, though — your primary Home screen’s getting 
a little crowded! In Figure 3-5, you see what happens if we try to drop the 
widget on the primary screen.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Whoops, no 
more room!
 
This is exactly where those extra Home screens come in handy:
 
1. While on the primary Home screen, swipe left.
 
 You should now be looking at a blank (or nearly blank) Home screen, 
devoid of the icons and other goodies you’re used to. Notice that you 
can still see your wallpaper in the background.
 
2. Push the Menu button.
 
3. Touch Add.
 
4. Touch Widget.
 
 The menu expands to show you all the widgets that are available to you.
 
5. Touch Search.
 
 And the Google search widget magically appears on the screen, ready 
for action.

38
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
But wait — we have one small problem. If you swipe to the right (so you’re 
now looking at the primary Home screen) and then swipe right again, you’ll 
notice that T-Mobile has already done you the favor of putting the same 
widget here! No problem; let’s delete it. The process is identical to removing 
an application icon:
 
1. Touch and hold the widget.
 
 The widget gets bigger and the phone briefly vibrates, indicating that 
the widget (just like an icon) can be moved or deleted.
 
2. Keeping your finger held to the screen, drag the widget to the trash 
can icon and release.
Your masterpiece is now complete. In addition to a modified primary Home 
screen, you can now kick off a Google search (see Figure 3-6) without even 
opening the Browser first!
 
Figure 3-6: 
Searching 
from the 
Home 
screen.
 
 
When it comes to Home screen organization, everything is treated the same. 
You can move, delete, and add applications, shortcuts, and widgets with equal 
aplomb using the guidelines you’ve uncovered here.
The Status Bar: Not Just for Checking 
Signal Strength Anymore
By now, I hope you agree that Android has taken the Home screen to an excit-
ing new level of configurability and utility. But the fun doesn’t stop there! If 
there’s one element of Android you’ll see more than the Home screen, it’s the 
status bar — and Google has put plenty of work into making sure it’s the best 
darned status bar it can be.

39
 Chapter 31: The Home Screen and Status Bar
Most phones have a bar across the top of the phone’s screen that shows 
basic, critical information about the phone’s functions. Signal and battery 
strength are the usual suspects, while many handsets also show indicators 
for new text messages and voice mail messages.
Android’s status bar does all those things and much, much more, thanks to 
its notification system, which I discuss in the next section. First, though, look 
at how your G1’s status bar is laid out. Figure 3-7 shows a typical status bar.
 
Figure 3-7: 
The Android 
status bar.

icons
Elements of the status bar include the following:
 
✓ Notification icons: These icons appear when various applications on 
your phone are trying to get your attention. I discuss these shortly — 
they’re powerful and important and you’ll use them frequently.
 
✓ Silent mode: If you’ve set your G1 to keep quiet, you see a musical note 
with a slash through it.
 
✓ Data transfer: When you’re connected to T-Mobile’s (or another wire-
less carrier’s) data network, arrows indicate when data is flowing in and 
out of your G1. When that network is a high-speed 3G network, you also 
see a small 3G symbol with these arrows. (But trust me, you’ll know 
from the speed of your e-mail and browsing that you’re on a fast connec-
tion!) 3G connections aren’t available in all areas, so if you see an 

40
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
E here instead, you’ll know you’re connected to EDGE, an older, slower 
network. If you have Wi-Fi enabled and you’re currently connected to 
an available network, the arrows are replaced with the symbol shown in 
Figure 3-8.
 
Figure 3-8: 
The G1

network.
 
WiFi active
 
✓ Signal strength: A standard signal strength meter indicates how well 
you’re connected to the cellular network. The more lit bars, the better.
 
✓ Battery meter: This icon indicates how much battery life remains on 
your current charge — green means full; black means it’s time to find an 
outlet! A lightning bolt in the icon means that your device is currently 
being charged.
 
✓ Time: Because you can never have too many ways to find the time, 
Android includes a digital clock in the status bar in addition to the clock 
widget available for the Home screen. Because the status bar is visible 
on almost any screen, the time is always available to you.
Notifications
You can think of notifications as brief messages that applications on your 
phone send to you, usually because they have something important to tell 
you. For example, the Messaging application might need to let you know that 
you’ve received a new picture message from Mom, or the Dialer app might 
need to tell you that you still have an active call.
The nature of the notification varies from application to application, and as 
you install new applications, you’ll sometimes find that they add their own 
notifications into the mix. Fortunately, the status bar is adept at aggregating 
and organizing these notifications into a one-stop shop.

41
 Chapter 31: The Home Screen and Status Bar
Perhaps the best part of these notifications is that because they’re displayed 
in the status bar — which you see in almost every application — you receive 
them no matter where you are in your G1. Whether you’re checking e-mail, 
browsing the Web, or buying music through Amazon MP3, you’ll get that 
text message that the meeting has been moved up an hour. (You’d better get 
going!)
Notification icons
The first way to display a notification, and the least invasive, is through a 
simple icon that appears in the upper left of the status bar. What if you need 
to see more, though? What if a simple icon isn’t enough to convey what you 
need to know? For that, you can expand the status bar to show a complete 
list of current notifications, as in Figure 3-9.
 
Figure 3-9: 
The 
expanded 
status bar,

notifica-
tions.
 
As you can see, you had dinner scheduled with a friend at 5:00 p.m. sharp 
today — and thanks to your G1, you weren’t late for it! Fortunately, the 
Calendar always makes sure that you’re kept abreast of upcoming appoint-

Beyond icons: The expanded view
To get to the expanded view of the status bar, hold your finger over the 
status bar and pull downward, as though the bar were a rolled-up window 
shade. You can do this from any screen in Android in which the status bar is 
visible (which is most of them).
To open an application that has posted a notification, just tap the notifica-
tion in question. The behavior of the application will vary based on the type 
of notification and the design of the application itself. However, in general, 
you’ll be taken to a screen that provides more detail regarding the notifica-
tion and gives you an opportunity to act on it.
To close the expanded view, just hold your finger on the bar at the bottom 
of the screen and drag it upwards. Once the bar reaches approximately the 
midpoint of the screen, you can let go and it will roll back up until you need it 
again.

S
ure, the G1 can do lots of amazing things — but at the end of the day, it’s 
still your phone, too! And as phones go, the G1 is about as full-featured 
as they come, offering conference calling, voice dialing, tight integration with 
your contacts, and a whole lot more. 
These days, though, much of the world’s real-time communication doesn’t 
involve a single spoken word. SMS, or Short Message Service, lets virtually 
any two cellphones zip quick text messages to each other, which is great 
for those times when a full-on phone conversation isn’t needed or you’re 
in a quiet (or noisy) place where talking to a caller isn’t appropriate. SMS 
is massively popular — so popular, in fact, that it has given rise to its own 
shorthand language designed to better accommodate the 160-character limit 
imposed on each message. (Let’s just say that “c u l8r” isn’t a license plate 
number.)
Android has comprehensive support for text messaging using both SMS and 
its more advanced sibling, MMS, or Multimedia Message Service. As its name 
implies, Multimedia Message Service allows you to attach pictures, sounds, 
and videos to your messages, and it also does away with that pesky charac-
ter limit that SMS messages have to deal with.

44
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
In this chapter, I show you how to make the most of your phone calls 
and your text messages alike. I may not turn you into an SMS lingo wizard 
(I recommend http://www.laptopmag.com/advice/tips/become-a-
text-message-shorthand-pro.aspx for that), but at least you’ll know 
where and how to send that lingo!
The Dialer
In Android, pretty much everything you do takes place in an application — 
just like on your PC — and making and receiving a phone call is no different. 
You use the Dialer application (pretty obvious name, right?) to take care of 
that business on the G1.
I touch on the Dialer in Chapter 2, where I show you how to make a phone 
call using the numeric keypad and introduce you to some of its cool call han-
dling features. Now let’s break down the application and find out everything 
it can do.
First, we need to open the Dialer. As with any other application, you can do 
this by tapping its icon in the Applications tab (or tapping its icon on your 
Home screen, if you’ve kept it there). The thing is, Google (and everyone else 
in the world) considers dialing an important function for a phone, so you can 
access the Dialer also by pushing the G1’s Send button.
Once you’re in the Dialer, you’re presented with four tabs across the top of 
the screen:
 
✓ Dialer: This is as simple as it gets — all you have is a numeric keypad 
(just like on any other phone you’ve used) and a bar where the entered 
number is displayed.
 
✓ Call log: If you enter the Dialer application by pushing the Send button, 
this tab is selected by default. It shows you a list of recent calls, both 
made and received. The Call log tab also shows you calls that you’ve 
missed.
 
✓ Contacts: This is your address book, the place where you store and 
access contact information permanently.
 
✓ Favorites: Think of this as the Contacts tab for people you really like (or 
those you have to call a lot). It’s basically just a special subgroup of the 
Contacts list for people you need to get in touch with frequently.

45
 Chapter 4: Making and Receiving Calls and Text Messages
The Dialer tab
As simple as the Dialer tab seems, it still has some tricks up its sleeve. While 
entering a number, the backspace icon to the right of the number bar (the 
area where the number appears) allows you to erase mistyped digits. Holding 
down the icon for about a half second, though, will erase the entire number.
If you need to make edits in the middle of a number, there’s even a way to do 
that: Use the trackball to highlight the number bar, and then move the track-
ball left or right to position the cursor. Then backspace to delete digits, or 
touch number keys to add new ones.
When you’re ready to place the call, either touch the number bar or push the 
Send button.
 
What if you’re provided a phone number as a series of letters, like 
1-800-ANDROID? (Don’t dial that, by the way; I just made it up.) You can 
always play hunt-and-peck like you would with a traditional phone, looking for 
each letter below the digits on the screen. The G1 makes it easier, though:
 
1. Open the screen.
 
 The screen flips from portrait (tall) to landscape (wide) mode, the 
numeric keypad disappears from the screen, and a prompt appears tell-
ing you to “Use keyboard to dial,” as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
Figure 4-1: 
The Dialer 
tab with the 
keyboard 
open.
 
Number bar
Backspace
 
2. Enter the full phone number, typing letters exactly as they appear.
 
 For example, if the number were 1-800-ANDROID, you would actually 
type 1800ANDROID. There’s no need to translate the letters to their cor-
responding numbers — Android does it for you!

46
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
Although the backspace icon is still visible on the screen when the keyboard 
is open, the backspace key on the keyboard performs exactly the same func-
tion, so you may want to use that instead. (No need to move your weary 
thumbs all the way from the keyboard to the screen if you don’t have to, 
right?)
Checking voice mail
As with many cellphones, the G1 lets you know that you’ve received voice 
mail by displaying an icon of a cassette tape at the top of the screen. In 
Android’s case, the voice mail icon on the status bar is a notification, which 
means you can get additional information about it by holding your finger on 
the status bar and pulling downward (see Figure 4-2).
 
Figure 4-2: 
The New 
voicemail 
notification.
 
The easiest way to check your voice mail is to simply pull down on the status 
bar and touch the row that displays New voicemail, which immediately dials 
your voice mail number. You can dial voice mail also directly from the Dialer 
tab by touching and holding the 1 key on the screen for about a half second. 
This is particularly useful if you don’t have any voice mail waiting but want to 
change your greeting or other options.
Jotting down a number and turning it into a contact
It happens all the time: You’re meeting someone for the first time, you need 
the person’s phone number, and he or she rattles it off to you. But what if 
you don’t have pen and paper at the ready? With Android, that’s no problem 
at all — you can quickly enter the number immediately using the Dialer with-
out going through the process of creating a new contact first.

47
 Chapter 4: Making and Receiving Calls and Text Messages
 
1. From the Dialer tab, enter a phone number as though you’re going to 
dial it.
 
2. Push the Menu button or press the Menu key on the keyboard.
 
 You see a single menu item at the bottom of the screen — Add to contacts.
 
3. Touch Add to contacts.
 
 A new screen appears asking you whether you’d like to add the number 
you just typed to an existing contact or create a new contact altogether.
 
I go through the creation and management of contacts in detail in Chapter 8. 
For now, keep in mind that you can add numbers to your contacts in this way.
The Call Log tab
Android considers the call log so important, it’s the first thing you see if you 
open the Dialer application using the Send button (see Figure 4-3). It makes 
sense — we all miss calls from time to time, receive calls from numbers we 
don’t already have stored in our contacts, and return calls to people who’ve 
recently called us. The call log helps you accomplish these tasks quickly and 
easily.

tab.

48
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
Let’s take a look at the components that make up the call log. For phone 
numbers that appear in your contacts, the name associated with the contact 
appears for each line item along with the type of number (mobile, work, 
home, and so on); otherwise, you simply see the phone number. To the left of 
the name or number, you see one of three icons:
 
✓ Placed call: A green arrow moving away from the phone. These are calls 
that you made.
 
✓ Received call: A blue arrow moving toward the phone. These are calls 
made to your phone that you (or whoever was using your phone) 
answered.
 
✓ Missed call: A red arrow bouncing off the phone. If you missed a call 
(or rejected it by pushing the End button), you see this.
To the right of the name or number, you see how long ago the event 
occurred. For made and received calls — in other words, calls that you didn’t 
miss or reject — you also see the duration of the call in hours, minutes, and 
seconds.
You can call back any number in your call log by simply touching it, but the 
fun doesn’t stop there. Touch and hold any item in the log for a moment and 
you’re presented with a menu of options — things you can do with that item. 
Let’s have a look at those options:
 
✓ Call <number>: This is the simplest option in the menu; it immediately 
dials the number as your G1 received it. This option is the same as 
touching an item directly in the call log.
 
✓ View contact: If the selected name is already in your contacts, this menu 
item becomes available and sends you to a screen with the details for 
that contact. This is especially handy if you want to call someone back 
at a different phone number than the one on which they called you.
 
✓ Edit number before call: If you need to make some changes to the 
number before you can dial it — adding a country code, for example — 
choose this option. The number will be sent to the Dialer tab for your 
editing.
 
✓ Send SMS message: This option opens the Messaging application and 
sets you up to send a text message to the selected phone number. 
I cover text messaging later in this chapter, in the “Text Messaging 
Application” section.
 
✓ Add to contacts: If the selected number isn’t currently in your contacts, 
this menu item appears. It takes you to a screen that allows you to add 
the number to an existing contact or a new one (just like touching the 
Add new contact option in the Dialer tab).

49
 Chapter 4: Making and Receiving Calls and Text Messages
 
✓ Remove from call log: Selecting this menu item removes the selected 
number from the log. How covert of you!
 
Pushing the Menu button from within the call log reveals a single item, Clear 
call log. It immediately clears your entire log without asking you for confirma-
tion. Use caution!
The Contacts tab
I’ll get into all the great things you can do with the Contacts tab in Chapter 8, 
but for the purposes of making phone calls and sending text messages, there 
are a few things to note here.
When you open the Contacts tab you see a list names, organized alphabeti-
cally, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 4-4: 
The 
Contacts 
tab.
 
To call a contact, touch the contract’s row in the list. You are presented with 
a list of all numbers associated with that contact. In fact, you’ll see every 
number twice — once under the Dial number heading and once under the 
Send SMS/MMS heading. This allows you to quickly place a call or send a text 
message with a single tap.

50
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
Touching a number under the Dial number heading places the call immedi-
ately. If it’s more convenient for you to keep your thumb on the trackball, you 
can also roll it until the number you want to call is selected, and then either 
press down on the trackball or push the Send button.
Similarly, selecting a number (either with the trackball or by touching it on 
the screen) under the Send SMS/MMS heading opens the Messaging applica-
tion and sets up a new message ready to be sent to the selected number.
If you return to the Contacts tab — remember that you can do this by push-
ing the Back button — there is another way to place a call or send a message 
to a contact without entering the contact’s screen. Touch and hold the con-
tact’s row in the list and you’ll see a menu of things you can do with the con-
tact, just as you saw in the call log. I look at most of these items in Chapter 9, 
but notice a couple of entries here:
 
✓ Call <number type>: The contact’s default phone number appears here. 
For example, if Joe’s default number is his cellphone, this says Call 
Mobile. Touching it places a call to that number immediately.
 
✓ Send SMS/MMS: Touching this starts the Messaging application and gets 
you set up to send a text message to the contact’s default number.
The Favorites tab
The Favorites tab functions in the same way as the Contacts tab — except 
it’s different. Bear with me, though! Of all the people in your contacts list, 
how many do you call on a regular basis? Five, maybe ten percent? Of course, 
that ratio varies from user to user, but the point is that you don’t want to 
have to sift through a thousand contacts every time you want to find Mom’s 
number. (What, you don’t know your own mother’s phone number? Shame!) 
The Favorites tab simply gives you a secondary view of your contacts, boiled 
down to just the ones you handpick.
Turning a contact into a favorite
Adding a contact to your Favorites is easy:
 
1. Touch the Contacts tab to open it.
 
2. Touch and hold on a contact that you want to turn into a favorite.
 
 After a moment, a menu appears.
 
3. Touch Add to favorites.

51
 Chapter 4: Making and Receiving Calls and Text Messages
You can also touch a contact (or hold down on a contact and select View 
contact from the pop-up menu) to go into its details screen and touch the 
star in the upper-right corner — it changes from white to yellow, indicating 
that it is now a favorite (see Figure 4-5).
 
Going to the Favorites tab, you’ll see that the contact has a yellow star next 
to it. I recommend not adding any more contacts here than you have to — the 
idea is to make this list short and easy to browse; otherwise, the Favorites tab 
becomes no faster to use than the Contacts tab itself.
 
Figure 4-5: 
The high-
lighted 
yellow star 
means this 
contact is a 
favorite.
 
Removing a favorite
Removing a favorite is similar to adding one:
 
1. Open the Favorites tab.
 
 You can also open the Contacts tab if you prefer — favorites are listed in 
both tabs.
 
2. Touch and hold the contact whose favorite status you want to remove.
 
 After a moment, a menu appears.
 
3. Touch Remove from favorites.

52
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
You may also touch the star in the upper-right corner of the contact’s details 
screen (accessible either by touching the contact or by touching and holding 
the contact and choosing View contact from the pop-up menu), turning the 
star from yellow to white.
 
Removing a favorite doesn’t delete the contact — it just removes it from the 
Favorites tab. The contact is still accessible from the Contacts tab.
Controlling the Volume
The volume buttons on the side of the phone control different types of 
volume, depending on what you’re doing on your G1 at the moment. For 
example, during a call, the volume buttons adjust the volume of the phone’s 
earpiece, speakerphone, or your headset — whatever you happen to be 
using. If you’re listening to music, the buttons control the volume of the 
music.
If you’re not actively performing any task that involves the use of sound, 
the volume buttons control the volume of the ringer that is sounded when 
you receive a call or a message. When you first press one of the volume but-
tons, a window appears that displays a horizontal bar graph indicating the 
ringer’s loudness (or softness). Touching up or down on the volume controls 
increases or decreases the ringer volume, respectively, and changes how 
“filled up” the bar graph appears. You also hear a sample tone with each 
press to give you an idea of how loud your G1 is set to ring.
Do you want the phone to vibrate or do nothing when a call comes in? 
Repeatedly push the minus volume button until the phone reaches zero 
volume (that is, the bar graph is empty); at that point, the phone is set to 
briefly vibrate when you get a call. If you push the minus volume button one 
more time, the phone won’t vibrate or ring; it’ll be completely silent when a 
call comes in. Indicators showing a phone set to a low volume, to vibrate, and 
to silent mode are shown in Figure 4-6.

 Chapter 4: Making and Receiving Calls and Text Messages
Bossing Your Phone around 
with the Voice Dialer
Sometimes, fiddling around with the screen to dial a number or to find a 
contact isn’t convenient. Maybe you’re walking briskly down the street and 
are fearful (understandably) of bumping into a huge, scary dude walking the 
other way if you take the time to look down and set up a call. There’s got to 
be a better way, right? There is!
The G1 supports voice dialing through a special application called Voice 
Dialer, which can understand spoken commands to dial a phone number, dial 
a contact by name, dial voicemail, or redial the last number dialed. What’s 
more, Voice Dialer can hear you from a distance of a few inches, so if you 
intend to make a call on the G1’s speakerphone and you want to use the 
Voice Dialer, you don’t need to begin by holding the phone up to your ear.
To command the G1 by voice, you need to get it to listen. That’s easy:
 
1. From any screen or application, push and hold the Send button.
 
 After a moment, you hear a beep, and the Voice Dialer window shown 
in Figure 4-7 appears. As the message on the screen indicates, you can 
speak any of a number of different commands:
 
• Call <contact name>
 
• Call <contact name> at <phone number type>, such as “Call Chris 
Ziegler at work.”
 
• Call voicemail
 
• Dial <phone number>
 
• Dial an emergency service such as 911, customer service using 811 
or 611, or information using 411
 
• Redial
 
2. Speak a command, with the handset held up to your ear or in your 
hand. Speak in a clear, deliberate voice.
 
 You see a list of possible matches for what you’ve said (see Figure 4-8). 
This list always appears, even if the G1 thinks you could have said only 
one thing, as a final safeguard against dialing someone you didn’t 
intend to!
 
3. Touch the selection that matches what you want to dial, or touch 
Cancel to end the command without doing anything.

Using Wired and Bluetooth Headsets
The G1 includes a wired stereo headset with a microphone attached to it 
that you can plug into the ExtUSB port on the bottom of the phone (see 
Figure 4-9). A special version of the Mini-USB standard for connecting devices 
between one another, ExtUSB was developed by the G1’s maker, HTC, to 
support both data and audio connections. What does that mean to you? 

55
 Chapter 4: Making and Receiving Calls and Text Messages
Basically, you use this port to connect the G1 both to your computer and 
your headset — there’s no separate audio jack like you may find on some 
other phones.
 
Figure 4-9: 
The G1’s 
ExtUSB 
port with

rubber cover

Wired headsets
To use the wired headset, simply connect it to the ExtUSB port. The G1 will 
automatically use the headset as your hands-free device — any calls you 
make or receive will be routed through it until you disconnect it.
Pairing and using Bluetooth headsets
For true portability and convenience, nothing beats a wireless Bluetooth 
headset for making hands-free calls. In this section I walk you through the 
process of setting up a Bluetooth headset for use with the G1.
 
The G1 doesn’t support the use of stereo Bluetooth headsets for listening to 
music wirelessly, but it does fully support mono headsets for making phone 
calls. Some wireless stereo headsets can function in a mono mode, however, 
so some of these may work with the G1. Consult your headset’s manual, or 
just give it a try — there’s no harm in that!
As with any other phone, the first step in using your Bluetooth headset with 
the G1 is to pair it. To do this:

56
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
 
1. Set your headset to pairing mode.
 
 The procedure for doing this varies from headset to headset, so check 
your manual.
 
2. On your G1, go to the Applications tab and select the Settings 
application.
 
3. In the Settings application, touch the Wireless controls menu item.
 
4. In the Wireless controls screen, make sure that the third item down — 
Bluetooth — has a check mark, as shown in Figure 4-10. 
 
 If the option doesn’t have a check mark, add one by touching the check 
box. If you’ve just added a check mark, it’ll take a moment for the G1’s 
Bluetooth radio to power on, at which point you’ll see a new icon for 
Bluetooth in the status bar (it looks like an angular letter B).
 
Figure 4-10: 
The 
Wireless 
controls 
screen of 
the Settings 
application.
 
 
5. Touch the fourth menu item in the Wireless controls screen, Bluetooth 
settings.
 
 The G1 begins scanning for Bluetooth-capable devices around you with 
which it can pair and then shows them in the lower half of the screen 
under the Bluetooth devices heading.
 
6. Touch the item in the Bluetooth devices list that represents the head-
set you’re trying to pair.
 
 Generally, the name you see in the list will be the make or model or both 
of your headset. You will be able to identify headsets in this list (versus 
Bluetooth-equipped computers and other devices) also from a headset 
icon, which appears to the right of the device’s name.

57
 Chapter 4: Making and Receiving Calls and Text Messages
 
7. Using the keyboard, enter your headset’s Bluetooth passcode in the 
field that appears on the screen.
 
 Generally, the passcode for headsets is 0000 or 1234, but check the user 
manual for your specific headset.
 
8. Touch OK.
 
 You’re all set! Connected appears below your headset’s name in the 
Bluetooth devices list, and the Bluetooth icon in the status bar changes, 
as shown in Figure 4-11, to indicate that a device is connected.
 
Figure 4-11: 
A Bluetooth 
headset 
has been 
connected.
 
Bluetooth device name
Headset icon
At this point, your phone operates just as though a wired headset were 
connected — all call sounds are routed through your Bluetooth headset as 
long as it’s turned on. If you turn the headset off, the G1 recognizes that and 
switches back to using its own earpiece and microphone (in other words, 
you’ll be holding the phone up to your face to make or receive calls). When 
you turn the headset back on, the G1 recognizes that, too, and starts using it 
immediately (as long as the G1’s Bluetooth radio is enabled, as mentioned in 
Step 4 in the preceding list).
Unpairing Bluetooth headsets
Now that you have your Bluetooth headset paired to the G1, the two will 
automatically hook up whenever they’re both turned on and the G1’s 
Bluetooth functionality is enabled. But what if that’s not what you want? If 
you have another phone that you want to use with this headset instead, you 
may want to unpair it from the G1 so that it won’t connect to the headset any-
more. Fortunately, that’s a cinch:
 
1. Go to the Applications tab and select the Settings application.
 
2. In the Settings application, touch the Wireless controls menu item.

58
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
 
3. Touch Bluetooth settings.
 
 In the lower half of the screen below the Bluetooth settings heading, 
you’ll see your paired headset — even if the headset is turned off or is 
too far away from your G1 to connect. The G1 remembers the headset 
because it was paired previously.
 
4. Touch and hold the headset’s menu item until a pop-up menu appears.
 
5. Touch Unpair.
The Messaging Application
As I mention in the previous section, you can automatically start a text mes-
sage to a contact or a phone number in the call log in several ways. If you 
open the Messaging application from a contact’s entry or an entry in the call 
log, you are taken to the thread for that contact (see Figure 4-12). A thread is 
simply all the text messages sent between you and the other person, orga-
nized into a timeline — a conversation view. This stellar feature, which many 
cellphones don’t have, makes text messaging a lot more fun and useful by 
organizing text the same way that you’re used to seeing instant messages 
using Google Talk, AIM, or a similar application on the PC (that is, in a back-
and-forth conversational style).
 
Figure 4-12:
A text 
messaging 
thread.
 

59
 Chapter 4: Making and Receiving Calls and Text Messages
Sending and receiving text (SMS) 
messages
For our first example, let’s assume you’ve selected a contact or call log entry 
from the Dialer application, which brings you straight to the thread view for 
that contact in the Messaging application. You don’t have to specify who this 
message is going to — that information has already been filled out for you.
Composing a message
If you have the screen closed, you’ll notice at the bottom of the application 
that you need to “Open keyboard to compose message.” In other words, you 
need to use the keyboard to type. Otherwise, all you can do here is read the 
conversation; you can’t send anything new.
Sending a text message from a thread couldn’t be any simpler:
 
1. Open the screen.
 
 The display switches to landscape mode and the text at the bottom 
changes to “Type to compose, press Enter to send.”
 
2. Start typing.
 
3. When you’ve finished composing your message, press the Enter key 
on the keyboard or touch Send on the screen.
 
 While the message is in the process of sending, an envelope icon 
appears to the right of your message in the thread. When your message 
has been successfully sent, the envelope disappears.
When you receive a text message, you receive a notification that looks like 
a postcard in the status bar. The message also briefly flashes across the 
status bar, which lets you preview it without having to go into the Messaging 
application. 
Pull down the status bar to reveal the notifications screen, which gives you 
details on who sent the message and a snippet of its contents. Just touch the 
notification in the screen to hop over to the Messaging application and view 
the thread.
 
Remember how I said that SMS messages must contend with a 160-character 
limit? The G1 actually allows you to send messages that are longer than that 
limit — they’re just broken into multiple 160-character chunks. Android gives 
you a way to see how many chunks you’re sending, too. As you get close to 
breaking past the first 160 characters, a small gray box appears in the upper-
right corner of your text box showing two numbers separated by a slash. The 

60
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
first number is the number of characters you have remaining in the current 
chunk; the second is the total number of chunks that will be sent. Because 
some phones (especially those without thread views) make it tricky to view 
multiple chunks, this is a handy piece of information to have.
Starting a new thread from the Messaging app
Of course, you don’t need to use the Dialer application to start a new mes-
sage; you can do it directly from the Messaging application as well. Let’s give 
it a shot:
 
1. From the Applications tab on the Home screen, touch the Messaging 
icon.
 
 Many people consider text messaging to be a vital part of their commu-
nication; if you’re a member of that group, you may want to place the 
Messaging icon on your Home screen as well.
 
2. No matter what screen within the Messaging application you are 
brought to, push the Menu button and choose Compose.
 
 When you open the Messaging app, you are always brought back to the 
last screen you had open, whether it be the list of all threads or a spe-
cific thread. Regardless, the Compose menu item is always available.
 
 At this point, you should now be looking at an empty thread with a blank 
To box at the top.
 
3. Open the keyboard.
 
4. Touch the To box and start typing the name of a contact or a phone 
number. Separate multiple contacts with commas.
 
 As you type, the phone searches for possible matches in your contacts 
list. If it finds some possibilities, it displays them in a list below the To 
box. At this point, you can select the intended recipient from the list, 
or if you’re typing a phone number, you can continue to type the entire 
number. If you’ve selected a contact from the list, a comma is automati-
cally placed at the end and you can immediately begin typing additional 
contacts if you so choose. If you’re typing a number, however, you have 
to enter the comma yourself.
Now, the process for sending a message is no different than if you had 
selected the contact from the Dialer app — just type your message using the 
box at the bottom of the screen and press Enter or touch Send when you’re 
finished.
Touching and holding for about a half second on an individual message in 
a thread calls up a pop-up menu of available commands. Depending on the 
message, here are some of the items you may see:

61
 Chapter 4: Making and Receiving Calls and Text Messages
 
✓ Call <number>: The phone number that sent the message to you is 
displayed here, and you’re given the option of calling it back. Yes, with 
actual voice instead of a text message!
 
✓ Forward: This option effectively forwards the selected message by 
inserting it into a new thread and allowing you to choose a new 
recipient.
 
✓ View message details: This item displays the type of the message (SMS 
or MMS), the sending phone number, and the date and time the message 
was sent.
 
✓ Delete message: If you just want to delete a single message out of the 
thread, this is the way to do it.
Sending and receiving multimedia (MMS) 
messages
Sometimes, text isn’t enough — you want to send a picture of that celebrity 
who just walked by you in the restaurant. (He doesn’t look so great in person, 
does he?) Maybe you want to send a clip of a song that’s on the radio right 
now. With MMS, the possibilities are almost endless.
In Android, MMS messages and SMS messages are treated virtually the same, 
which makes them especially easy to send and receive. Both types of mes-
sages appear together in your threads — the only difference is that an MMS 
message can have more stuff attached to it. Figure 4-13 shows an example of 
an audio file attached to an MMS.
 
Figure 4-13: 
An MMS 
message

audio file.
 
Multimedia messages can be composed of as many as three parts, all of 
which are optional:

62
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
 
✓ Subject: This is a short subject line that describes your message.
 
✓ Body: The body is the main text of your message. This can be rather 
long, unlike the 160-character limit for SMS messages.
 
✓ Attachment: This can be audio, video, or a picture.
Sounds kind of like an e-mail message, doesn’t it? Think of an MMS message 
as a way to push a short, quick e-mail to someone’s phone so that he or she 
will see it as quickly as possible — your recipient is notified right away.
 
Unlike Android-powered cellphones like the G1, not all cellphones support 
MMS (though most phones sold today do). You may want to consult with your 
friends and other contacts before sending multimedia messages to them. If 
you send a message that a recipient claims never to have received, his or her 
phone may not support MMS.
Playing media attached to a multimedia message
What happens when you get a multimedia message? Not much, actually — 
you receive a notification that looks like a postcard, just as you would with 
a text message, and you view the message in the same way. The difference, 
of course, is that there’s likely some multimedia involved! When you open 
a message thread after receiving an MMS, you might see a picture or a play 
button, depending on the type of media that was sent to you. If you see a pic-
ture, touching it enlarges it; if you see a play button, pushing it plays the clip. 
Waiting a moment or pushing the Back button returns you to the thread.
Sending a multimedia message
When sending a multimedia message, you enter text just as you would with a 
text message — this becomes the body of the message. Additionally, you can 
enter a subject and attach media.
While you’re looking at a message thread (create a new one if you like), push 
the Menu button. Of the menu items, two are notable here:
 
✓ Add subject: As mentioned, subject lines are one of the features that set 
MMS messages apart from SMS messages. Touching this item converts 
your message to MMS format and gives you a subject line at the top of 
the screen — just use your keyboard to fill it in.
 
✓ Attach: This is the fun part! Touching this displays a prompt to select a 
type of media to attach to your message.
If you touch Attach, several attachment types are available in the menu:
 
✓ Pictures: This item opens a viewer that allows you to select a picture 
that is already stored on your G1.

63
 Chapter 4: Making and Receiving Calls and Text Messages
 
✓ Camera: Like Pictures, this option ultimately results in a picture being 
attached to your message. However, this option opens the Camera appli-
cation and allows you to take a picture right now instead of selecting an 
image that you already have stored.
 
✓ Audio: Here, you are prompted to select an audio file that resides on 
your phone. Highlighting a file without selecting it plays it, allowing you 
to preview the clip before you decide whether to attach it.
 
✓ Record audio: This option is the audio equivalent of Camera — it allows 
you to record a new audio clip in real time instead of selecting a clip you 
already have stored.
 
✓ Slideshow: Want to send several pictures at once? Check out the 
Slideshow option! It lets you assemble multiple pictures into an auto-
matically advancing slideshow — basically a movie of pictures.
After you’ve selected an attachment, you see a view similar to Figure 4-14, 
which shows an attached audio clip that’s ready to send. Using the buttons 
to the right of the attachment, you can play the clip, replace it with a differ-
ent one, or remove it. When you’re ready to send your message, do so just as 
you would with a text message: Touch Send on the screen or press the Enter 
key on your keyboard.

Managing threads
From any thread, you can push the Menu button and choose All threads 
to return to the view showing all your message threads (see Figure 4-15). 
Remember that a thread is a messaging conversation that you’re having with 
a single person (or a group of people), so the All threads view has one line 
item for each contact (or group) with whom you’ve been sending or receiving 
messages. A green bar appears to the left of any thread that has messages 
you haven’t read.

64
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
 
Figure 4-15: 
The All 
threads 
view.
 
From here, you can start a new thread with the New message row at the top 
of the screen, or you can view a specific thread by touching it. You might 
open a specific thread to review what has been sent and received within a 
conversation or if you want to send a new message to a contact with whom 
you already have a thread going.
To delete an individual thread:
 
1. Touch and hold a thread’s row in the list for about a half second.
 
 A new menu appears with two options, View and Delete. Choosing View 
has the same effect as simply touching a thread’s row — it opens the 
thread for viewing and sending new messages.
 
2. Touch Delete.
 
 You are warned that the entire thread will be deleted. Gone. Kaput!
 
3. Touch OK.
To delete all threads from the All threads view:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the Delete threads menu item on the screen.
 
 
Just like when you’re deleting a specific thread, Android warns you of 
the implications of your action. But in this case, you’re about to wipe all 
text and multimedia messages from the phone. Be sure you want to do 
this!
 
3. Touch OK.

65
 Chapter 4: Making and Receiving Calls and Text Messages
Messaging settings
Pushing the Menu button from the All threads view reveals a Settings menu 
item, where you can tweak some of the finer points of how the Messaging 
application works. Let’s have a look at those settings. First, you have a sec-
tion titled SMS settings with a pair of options:
 
✓ Delivery reports: Selecting this option (by touching the check box to 
add a check mark) instructs T-Mobile that you want to receive confir-
mation that every message you send has been received. To view this 
report, touch and hold an individual message in a thread, and choose 
View report in the menu that subsequently pops up.
 
✓ Manage SIM card messages: The Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card 
in your phone — the little chip that lets T-Mobile know who you are — 
has a bit of memory on it and is capable of storing SMS messages. This 
feature is rarely used, but if you have messages on your SIM that you’d 
like to view or move to your G1, this is the place to do it.
Next, you have a section entitled MMS settings:
 
✓ Delivery reports: This option works just like the Delivery reports setting 
for SMS messages.
 
✓ Read reports: In addition to getting a report when an MMS message is 
delivered, you can be notified when it has been read by the recipient.
 
 
The Read reports option doesn’t always work — it depends on the 
recipient’s phone and the whims of the wireless carriers involved. Don’t 
count on it!
 
✓ Auto-retrieve: Unlike an SMS message, MMS messages don’t necessarily 
have to be automatically retrieved in their entirety. Downloading them 
can consume considerable amounts of data because of the media attach-
ments involved, so if you’re trying to conserve battery life or watch your 
data usage, it’s a good idea to turn off this option. (Don’t worry — you’ll 
still be able to retrieve your MMS messages manually.)
 
✓ Roaming auto-retrieve: When you’re using a carrier other than 
T-Mobile — in a foreign country, for example — data services can be 
extremely expensive. It’s a good idea to leave this option disabled so that 
your MMS messages aren’t quietly retrieved at exorbitant rates when 
you’re roaming on another carrier’s network. 

66
Part I: Introducing Android and the T-Mobile G1 
The final section is called Notification settings:
 
✓ Notifications: Deselecting this option stops you from receiving a noti-
fication in your G1’s status bar when you receive a message. Typically, 
you’ll want to leave this enabled, unless you get a ton of messages and 
it’s a distraction.
 
✓ Select ringtone: Choosing this item brings up a menu that lets you 
choose the tone your G1 plays when you receive a message. (Regardless 
of your choice, you won’t hear it if your phone is in Silent mode, which 
is a good thing!)
 
✓ Vibrate: If this option is selected, the phone rumbles when you receive a 
message.
Now that you have the two important ways to communicate with the G1 
under your belt, I turn my attention to searching the Internet, your contacts, 
and your applications in Chapter 5 — but communication is never far away! I 
revisit it with Gmail in Chapter 6 and instant messaging in Chapter 12. 
Taking your G1 abroad
You may be familiar with the concept of roam-
ing, which occurs when you use your cell-
phone on a carrier’s network other than the 
one to which you subscribe. Roaming occurs 
whenever you take your G1 to another coun-
try. (Although T-Mobile USA is a subsidiary 
of the same company that operates T-Mobile 
networks in several other countries around the 
world, each of these networks is considered its 
own independent entity.)
The G1 supports quad-band GSM, which 
means it supports four frequencies of cellular 
service that together cover most of the globe. 
It’s a handy feature, but be careful — roaming 
expenses can add up very quickly! Using your 
phone to make voice calls outside the United 
States can cost from 49¢ to as much as $5 per 
minute or more, so roaming is best left to the 
expense account if possible. 
Data services such as MMS cost even more — 
which is why the G1 gives you the option of dis-
abling the automatic retrieval of such messages 
when the phone is not connected to your own 
network. This option can definitely save you 
from experiencing a heart-stopping expensive 
bill or two. Within the United States, you may 
roam on carriers besides T-Mobile, but don’t 
worry — domestic roaming through T-Mobile 
doesn’t cost you anything.

Part II
Putting the 
“Google” in 
Google Android

In this part . . .
You can’t look too far through the G1’s software and 
hardware without finding at least a few references to 
Google — and for good reason. Like all Android-powered 
phones, the G1 gives you access to a world of Google-
based services that you’re accustomed to using on your 
desktop or laptop computer. Part II takes you through 
these, starting with searching (where else?) and moving 
on through Gmail, Maps, Contacts, and Calendar.

Chapter 5
Searching 
In This Chapter
▶ Finding Internet content as fast as you do on your PC
▶ Searching contacts quickly and efficiently
▶ Tracking down the applications you’ve installed
I
n the past, searching for stuff on your phone — be it your sister’s phone 
number, your dry cleaner’s address, or the name of the 23rd president of 
the United States (it’s Benjamin Harrison, by the way) — wasn’t just difficult. 
Often the task was simply impossible, depending on the model of phone you 
were using.
Imagine, for a moment, having to use your PC without any searching capabil-
ity whatsoever. What would you do? How would you get around? How would 
you find everything you needed on a daily basis? It’d be nearly impossible 
considering the sheer volume of information we’re presented with these 
days.
Cellphones are becoming so powerful and capable that they’re starting to run 
into some of the same challenges we’ve faced on PCs. No longer can a self-
respecting phone get by without powerful contact and rich Internet search-
ing capabilities. The information’s there — why shouldn’t we be able to find 
it easily?
If you guessed that a phone powered by software created by the world’s 
largest Internet search company would have fantastic searching capabilities, 
you’re absolutely correct. The G1 can pretty much search its way out of even 
the tightest bind, and in this chapter, I show you how.
Searching the Internet
If your previous phone had a small screen, a slow data connection, or both, 
you may never have even thought of searching the Internet from the comfort 
of your mobile companion. With the G1, though, it’s a way of life.

70
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
Searching from the Home screen
You have no fewer than three good ways to search the Internet right from 
your Home screen. Yes, three — and if that’s not a sign that Google’s trying 
to tell you it’s fun and easy to find what you’re looking for out on the Web, I 
don’t know what is!
All of the techniques mentioned in this chapter (and indeed, any technique 
mentioned in this book where text entry is needed) require that the keyboard 
be open so that you can type your search. So you may as well prepare by 
opening the screen now if you haven’t already.
Method one:
 
1. Push the phone’s Menu button or the keyboard’s Menu key.
 
 The Home screen’s menu appears.
 
2. Press the Search icon.
 
 If you have a Google Search widget somewhere on your Home screen 
(your primary screen or elsewhere), you are taken straight to the 
widget, and a keyboard cursor is placed in the text box so you can start 
typing. If you don’t have the widget, a search box appears at the top of 
the screen below the status bar, as shown in Figure 5-1.
 
Figure 5-1: 
The Google 
search bar.
 
Method two:
 
1. Press the search key (see Figure 5-2) on the keyboard.
 
 That’s it. There is no Step 2. That search key’s great, isn’t it?

71
 Chapter 5: Searching
 
Figure 5-2:

board’s

Search
If you have the Google Search widget installed somewhere on your home 
screen, you can kick off a search from the Home screen with a third method:
 
1. Locate the widget.
 
 Remember that by default, the Google Search widget is installed on the 
portion of the Home screen to the right of the primary view, so you’d get 
to the widget by swiping to the left.
 
2. Touch the text box within the widget.
 
 This action highlights the text box and places a cursor within it. You’re 
ready to rock.
Searching from the Browser
I cover the G1’s amazing browsing capabilities in detail in Chapter 10, but 
I thought I’d mention it here as well because you search from the Browser 
in the same way as you do from the Home screen. You can kick off a search 
from the Browser by pushing the Menu button and choosing Search, or by 
pressing the search key on the keyboard. Either way, a search bar appears at 
the top of the application and you can begin typing.
 
A cool shortcut for initiating an Internet search works only in the Browser, 
and only when a text field is not highlighted: Just start typing. The applica-
tion automatically brings up the search bar and shows what you’ve typed so 
far. (The text you’re typing here can also be a Web site address instead of a 
search — the Browser detects the difference.)

72
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
Starting the search
After you’ve entered your search terms (don’t be shy — enter the same 
terms you would on your desktop browser), press the Enter key on the key-
board or touch the Search icon next to the text box to put Google to work. 
(Note that the Search icon is replaced with a Go icon if you’ve used the 
Browser shortcut I mention in the preceding Tip.) The Browser opens and 
you see search results just like you see when you use google.com on any 
computer.
Search suggestions
Regardless of where or how you initiate your search across the vast reposi-
tory of information we call the Internet, Google provides suggestions of what 
it thinks you might be trying to search for as you type. (The shortcut I men-
tion in the Browser is a notable exception to this rule.) Although the G1 has 
an excellent keyboard for its size, it’s always great when the phone can help 
you cut back on a few keystrokes!
For example, if I type andr and pause for a moment, the G1 talks to Google’s 
servers and discovers that I might be trying to spell out android, andrea 
bocelli, or andrew sullivan (see Figure 5-3). I can keep scrolling down this list 
to see other suggestions as well, but in this case, it has correctly guessed 
that I wanted to search for Android. All I need to do is select it from the list 
and the search will begin immediately.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Search 
suggestions.
 

73
 Chapter 5: Searching
Searching Your Contacts
The G1 can store a virtually limitless number of contacts, and if you’ve been 
using your Google account extensively, you already have a ton of ’em stored 
on the phone after the very first time you powered it on, signed in, and 
allowed it to sync up. Sure, you could browse through them every time you 
need to choose one for a call, a text message, or an e-mail, but thankfully you 
don’t have to.
The easiest, most hassle-free way to search your contacts doesn’t even 
involve going into the Contacts application — you do it right from the Home 
screen:
 
1. Start typing the first few letters of the first or last name of the contact 
you’re looking for.
 
 You are transported to the Contacts application, and the letters you’ve 
typed appear at the bottom of the screen. (In Figure 5-4, for example, I 
typed b.) The contacts list looks and behaves the same way as it always 
does; the only difference is that it is now filtered to match your criteria.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Typing a 
letter of 
a contact 
name to 
filter the 
contacts 
list.
 
 
2. Select the contact you are looking for as you normally would.
 
 At this point, you can perform all the functions you would expect with a 
contact, such as placing a call by pushing the Send button or editing the 
contact.
You can search your contacts in the same way by first going into the 
Contacts application (or going into the Dialer application and selecting the 
Contacts tab) and then typing your search. Searching this way requires that 
one extra step of going into the Contacts app, so you probably won’t use this 
technique unless you’re already in the Contacts application when you need 
to search.

74
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
Searching for Your Applications
Fresh out of the box, the G1 starts its life with plenty of applications. By the 
time you load it with a hearty helping of third-party software, the contents of 
the Applications tab can become downright daunting to navigate, as shown 
in Figure 5-5.
 
Figure 5-5: 
A fully 
loaded 
Applications 
tab with 
a number 
of third-
party apps 
installed.
 
How can you manage it? It helps that the list of icons is sorted alphabetically 
by default, but it probably comes as no surprise that you can search it as 
well:
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Applications tab to open it.
 
2. Type the first few letters of the application you’re looking for.
 
 In effect, this search works the same as searching for a contact. As you 
type, the list gets shorter and shorter. Even if you know only the first 
letter of the app, that should be enough to narrow the list enough so you 
can easily see what you’re looking for.
With their Google pedigree, it should come as no surprise that Android and 
the G1 offer such a powerful set of searching tools — but that’s just the 
beginning! In upcoming chapters, I show you how to take full advantage of 
your contacts, your Internet browsing capabilities, and all the applications 
you’ve installed (and can install). The sky’s the limit, and we’re just getting 
started.

Chapter 6
Using Gmail and Other 
E-Mail Services 
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up your Gmail accounts 
▶ Receiving and reading e-mails in Gmail
▶ Working with labels and views
▶ Writing and sending e-mails in Gmail

▶ Setting up an Email account
▶ Receiving e-mails in Email

L
ike it or not, e-mail is quickly becoming a predominant form of communi-
cation in the world. (Actually, let’s face it — it’s already there.) A healthy 
percentage of the phone calls that were made or the letters that were mailed 
ten years ago have now been replaced by e-mails, so we need easy access to 
our e-mail accounts in as many places (and in as many ways) as possible.
Although many phones can be set up to send and receive e-mail, few can do it 
with the finesse of the G1. Even if you’re coming from an e-mail powerhouse 
such as a BlackBerry or an iPhone, you’ll find that the G1 can do some cool 
tricks that you may not be used to. Here’s a quick look at some of the things 
that makes Android’s e-mail support so great:

76
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
✓ Threaded conversations: If you use Gmail on your PC, you’re familiar 
with this feature (though you may not know it by name). In a threaded 
conversation, all e-mails from the same conversation are grouped into a 
single chain, which makes the conversation much easier to read — no 
more jumping from message to message.
 
✓ Push support: The G1’s Gmail application supports push, which simply 
means that new e-mails are fed to you in near real-time instead of you 
manually retrieving them (or setting them up to be retrieved at a regular 
interval). In practical terms, it means your e-mail is delivered to your G1 
as quickly as possible.
 
✓ Notifications: Most phones can notify you of new e-mail in one way or 
another, Android has a fabulous notification system integrated into the 
status bar — and as you might expect, the Email and Gmail applications 
support it.
 
✓ Support for labels and stars: Just like Gmail on your desktop, you can 
see what labels are applied to your e-mails and apply or remove labels. 
You can do the same with stars, which are simply a tool to make impor-
tant e-mails stand out.
 
Although your G1 can support any POP3- or IMAP-based e-mail account, note 
that you have to use a different, dedicated e-mail application for all non-Gmail 
accounts, which I describe in the second half of this chapter. Gmail gets its 
own special application (it’s a Google service, after all!) that provides quite a 
bit of extra functionality — including the threaded conversations, push, and 
label and star support features just mentioned — so use a Gmail account as 
your primary e-mail account on the G1 if possible.
In this chapter, I introduce you to both the Gmail and Email applications and 
take you through the full range of their capabilities. Heck, by the end of this 
chapter, you may be asking yourself whether you even need a PC for this 
stuff. (Not really, but almost!)
Gmail
Before you even start using Gmail on the G1, it already has one great thing 
going for it over other e-mail services: There’s no setup! Remember when you 
first turned on the phone and entered (or created) your Google account infor-
mation? Gmail is an integral part of your account, and it was automatically 
configured at that very moment.

77
 Chapter 6: Using Gmail and Other E-Mail Services
Retrieving new e-mail
Because Gmail on the G1 uses push technology, there’s nothing to retriev-
ing new e-mails — literally. When you choose the Gmail icon from the 
Applications tab to fire it up, you are immediately taken to the Inbox, where 
your e-mail is waiting for you (see Figure 6-1).

The Gmail 
Inbox.

Personal level indicator
Let’s break down what you’re seeing here:
 
✓ Current label: If you’ve used other e-mail services or an e-mail program 
for your PC such as Outlook, you might be accustomed to organizing 
your e-mail in folders. (And if you aren’t, I’d wager you have a pretty 
messy inbox!) In Gmail, labels take the place of folders. In many ways, 
labels function the same way as folders — you can select a label name to 
see all the e-mails that have that label applied, for example. But you can 
apply multiple labels to an e-mail. For example, if you get an e-mail about 
the annual company picnic, you can apply both Work and Fun labels.
 
 At the top of the screen you see the label whose contents (that is, 
e-mails) you’re browsing. The number of unread e-mails with this label 
applied appears in parentheses after the label name.
 
 
In Gmail, even the Inbox is considered a special type of label. In fact, if 
you load the contents of another label, and an e-mail that’s currently in 
your Inbox appears there, you’ll see an Inbox tag in the lower right of 
the e-mail’s row — just as you would for any other label.
 
✓ Subject: The subject line of the e-mail.

78
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
✓ Personal level indicator: If you have this feature enabled in Gmail on 
your desktop, you’ll be familiar with how it works. A double arrow 
means the e-mail is addressed just to you, a single arrow means you 
appear in the To list with other recipients, and no arrow means you 
don’t appear in the recipient list at all (for example, if you received the 
e-mail because you’re on a mailing list or you were blind carbon copied).
 
✓ Sender: The name of the e-mail’s sender. If multiple e-mails are in this 
thread, you will see multiple names here (separated by commas) fol-
lowed by the total number of emails in the thread in parentheses. If 
you’re in the middle of a reply to this thread, you also see the word 
Draft listed as one of the senders; this simply means your reply has been 
drafted but not yet sent.
 
✓ Label: Any labels applied to this e-mail, separated by commas. Labels 
appear in a colored box so they’re especially easy to see. Note that you 
will not see a label’s name here if you are currently in that label’s view. 
For example, if you’re looking at the contents of a label titled Work, you 
will not see the Work label applied to any e-mails. Google does this to 
reduce screen clutter.
 
✓ Star: A yellow star indicates that this e-mail is starred; a gray star indi-
cates that the e-mail is not. Like the Inbox, the star is a special label, 
which means a view in the Gmail application allows you to see only 
starred e-mails. How (and whether) you decide to star e-mails is up 
to you.
 
✓ Date or time: If an e-mail was received today, you see the time it was 
received. Otherwise, you see the date it was received instead.
Notice that unread e-mails appear in bold with a white background, whereas 
read e-mails appear in a standard typeface with a gray background.
Although your e-mail is being refreshed in near real-time, there may be times 
when you’re feeling really impatient (we’ve all been there). If that happens, 
you can refresh your e-mail list manually:
 
1. From the Inbox view, push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the Refresh icon.
 
 In the status bar a circular arrow briefly appears to let you know that 
the phone is synchronizing your information with Google. After the icon 
disappears, new e-mail received since the last synchronization (no more 
than a few minutes) appears, the read/unread status on all your e-mails 
is updated, and labels and stars are refreshed.
Even when you’re not in the Gmail application, new e-mails are received and 
you are notified about them, as shown in Figure 6-2. Just touch the New email 
notification to go straight to your Inbox.

Reading and working with e-mail
The simplest and likely most frequent thing you’ll want to do with e-mail is 
read it. To do this, highlight an e-mail in the list with the trackball and select 
it by pressing down on the trackball, or simply touch the e-mail with your 
finger.
Once you’ve selected an e-mail, the view of an e-mail thread is very much 
like what you see in desktop Gmail — a series of individual e-mails in suc-
cession that can be expanded or collapsed (see Figure 6-3). When an e-mail 
is collapsed, all you’ll see of it is a gray header that tells you who sent the 
e-mail, whether it’s starred, and the date (or time) it was sent. At the top of 
the screen, you see the subject line, which is common to all the e-mails in the 
thread.
To read through the thread, swipe up and down or move the trackball up 
and down. When expanded, the bottom of each e-mail in the thread has three 
icons — Reply, Reply all, and Forward — which work just as you’re used to.
 
Even though Gmail intelligently shows you all the e-mails pertaining to the 
same subject in a single thread, it does make a difference which Reply, Reply 
all, or Forward icon you touch! For example, if you have three e-mails in a 
thread and you expand the middle message and touch Reply, the text quoted 
below the body of your reply comes from that middle message, not the most 
recent message in the thread.

A thread

e-mails 
(left); a

and one

e-mail 
(right).
 
If you scroll to the bottom of a thread that’s in your Inbox, you’ll see three 
additional icons: Archive, Labels, and Delete. These work the same as the 
Archive, Change labels, and Delete menu items, which we look at next. If 
you’re in another labeled view besides the Inbox, you may see different or 
fewer icons, depending on what options are appropriate. For example, the 
Archive icon may be replaced with a Remove label icon that simply removes 
the current label. If you’re viewing the Trash, Delete obviously doesn’t make 
much sense, so you won’t see it.
Now, return to the Inbox. (If you’re currently looking at an e-mail thread, just 
push the Back button to return to the Inbox.) By touching and holding on a 
thread’s row in the list, you are presented with a menu of things you can do 
with the thread, as shown in Figure 6-4.
Let’s have a look at the available options:
 
✓ Read: The first option takes you to the thread view to read the thread. 
This option is equivalent to simply touching the row itself, so don’t 
waste your time with this one!
 
✓ Archive: This option removes the entire selected thread to the All Mail 
view, which means the thread is no longer visible from your Inbox but 
is still in the background if you ever need it. If you’re a current user of 
Gmail, you’re probably familiar with this technique.
 
✓ Mark read/Mark unread: If you’ve already read a thread, this option lets 
you mark it as unread, and vice versa. As mentioned, unread messages 
are in bold type with a white background and read messages are in regu-
lar type with a gray background.

81
 Chapter 6: Using Gmail and Other E-Mail Services
 
✓ Add star/Remove star: This option is self explanatory, and like the 
Read menu item, there’s not much point in using it from here — you can 
simply touch the star itself to the right side of each thread’s row.
 
✓ Delete: This menu option moves the entire thread to the Trash. In Gmail, 
the Trash is deleted on a rolling 30-day cycle, so you have basically a full 
month to retrieve deleted stuff if you have a change of heart.
 
✓ Change labels: This option lets you modify the labels that are applied to 
this thread. I get into label management in more detail next.
 
✓ Report spam: If you’ve received unwanted, unsolicited bulk e-mail (affec-
tionately known as spam), touch here to let Google know that the mes-
sage falls into this category.
 
Figure 6-4: 
The e-mail 
pop-up 
menu.
 
 
Staying on top of spam reporting is important because it helps Google do a 
better job of automatically filtering the garbage before it ever gets to you. 
That means fewer spam e-mails will show up in your Inbox — and when you’re 
trying to manage your e-mail from the palm of your hand, you don’t need any 
unnecessary distractions! 
 
All of these menu items are available also from within e-mail threads them-
selves — just push the Menu button to call up the in-thread menu. To see the 
Report spam option, you need to touch the More item.

82
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
Managing labels
You can’t create or delete labels from the Gmail application on your G1; you 
need to log on to Gmail at gmail.com from your PC or the G1’s Browser for 
that. What you can do, though, is add and remove the labels you’ve already 
created. There are two ways to do this, depending on what you’re currently 
looking at. If you’re viewing a list of e-mails (say, your Inbox or another label):
 
1. Touch and hold an e-mail until the pop-up menu appears.
 
2. Touch Change labels.
If you’re currently within a thread, the procedure is slightly different:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the Change labels item in the menu that appears at the bottom 
of the screen.
Either way, you see a screen that looks similar to Figure 6-5.
 
Figure 6-5: 
The Choose 
labels 
window.
 
Labels that are currently applied to this thread appear with a red circle with 
a minus symbol within it, and labels that are not applied have a green circle 
with a plus symbol. As you may have guessed, touching a red circle removes 
that label, and touching a green one adds it.

83
 Chapter 6: Using Gmail and Other E-Mail Services
 
Remember that Inbox is just a special label, which is why it appears here. 
Removing the Inbox label will cause the thread to disappear from your Inbox, 
but it will still be visible from the All Mail view or by viewing any other labels 
that may be applied to the thread.
When you’ve finished adjusting the labels for this thread, touch OK to con-
firm or Cancel to discard your changes.
Views
The main reason to label e-mails is to tame your wild Inbox into a bunch of 
more manageable views. All labels in your Gmail account — both built-in 
labels such as Inbox and Starred and labels you create on your own — have 
their own views that allow you to see only e-mails with that label. The G1 
makes it easy to see and use these views:
 
1. Go to your Inbox (or any other view).
 
2. Push the Menu button.
 
3. Touch the View labels menu item.
 
 You’ll see a screen similar to Figure 6-6.
 
Figure 6-6: 
The View 
labels 
screen.
 

84
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
4. Touch the name of the label (or other view) whose contents you want 
to see.
 
 In addition to the Inbox, you’ll see other views in addition to the labels 
you’ve created — Sent, Outbox, Drafts, All Mail, Spam, Trash, and 
Chats (an archive of your Google Talk conversations, which I explore in 
Chapter 12).
Views with unread e-mails appear with a vertical green bar to the left and a 
gray box to the right, containing the number of unread e-mails.
That’s all there is to it — you now know how to view any label’s contents. 
You’ll notice that every view looks pretty much the same as the Inbox, and 
you manage e-mails in these views in the same way as you do in the Inbox.
After you’ve finished working with label views, you’ll probably want to return 
to your Inbox since it’s the home base of your vast e-mail empire. To do so, 
push the Menu button and touch the Back to Inbox item. Or you can touch 
the View labels item to return to the list of all labels (which includes the 
Inbox).
Writing and sending e-mails
Of course, there’s a whole lot more to e-mail than just reading it, isn’t there? 
You’ll want to send a few, too, especially when you take the G1’s lovely, 
expansive keyboard into consideration.
If you’re replying to (or forwarding) an e-mail you’ve received, simply touch 
Reply, Reply all, or Forward to get the process started. If you want to com-
pose a fresh message from scratch, however, that’s easy too:
 
1. While looking at the Inbox or another label view, push the Menu 
button.
 
2. Touch the Compose menu item.
At this point — whether you’re replying to, forwarding, or starting a new 
e-mail, you’ll be looking at a screen with a To box, a Subject box, and a 
body, as shown in Figure 6-7. (As a reminder, the To and Subject boxes will 
say To and Subject in light gray text until you begin typing in them.) This 
screen looks and works a lot like the multimedia message editing screen in 
the Messaging application — just select the box you want to edit and start 
typing. As with other G1 applications where you need to enter text, you’ll 
need to open the keyboard to get the job done.

85
 Chapter 6: Using Gmail and Other E-Mail Services
 
Figure 6-7: 
Composing 
a reply to

To
Subject
Body
In the To box, separate each contact with a comma. When you begin typing, 
the G1 starts searching both the name and e-mail address fields of your con-
tacts to try to find a match. If the G1 finds anything, it shows a list of matches 
below the box as you type. If you see your match, just touch it or select it 
with the trackball and it will be added to the list of recipients in the To box.
If you need to add carbon copy (CC) or blind carbon copy (BCC) recipients to 
the e-mail, the procedure is straightforward:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the Add Cc/Bcc menu item.
 
 Both CC and BCC boxes are added to the e-mail between the To and 
Subject boxes. They work exactly like the To box — just start typing 
a contact name or an e-mail address, and the G1 will attempt to locate 
a match for you so you don’t have to type the whole thing. As before, 
separate multiple addresses with commas.
If you later decide you don’t need the CC and BCC fields, deleting them is no 
biggie, either — just push Menu and touch Remove Cc/Bcc. (When you have 
the keyboard open, this may appear as “Remove Cc/...” because the G1 can’t 
quite make the whole thing fit.)
When you’ve finished filling out the To, Subject, and body boxes, your e-mail 
is ready to send. If you’re near the bottom of the e-mail, you’ll see these three 
icons:

86
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
✓ Send: Immediately sends the e-mail off to its excited recipients.
 
✓ Save as draft: Saves your work to the Drafts view to be completed at a 
later time.
 
✓ Discard: Throws away the message you’ve composed.
 
Unlike deleting an e-mail you’ve received, discarding an e-mail you’re in the 
middle of composing will not send it to the Trash where you can retrieve it 
later if you need it. A deleted e-mail is gone forever, so make sure you really 
want to get rid of it.
If you don’t happen to be near the bottom of the e-mail, you won’t see those 
icons, but never fear — there’s no reason to scroll down to find ’em! Just 
push the Menu button and you’ll have access to the Send and Discard com-
mands from there. (You still need to use the icon at the bottom of the e-mail 
if you want to save your work to Drafts, however.)
Sending attachments
Unlike your PC, Gmail on the G1 will allow you to send only pictures as 
attachments, so if you need to send something else, such as a video or a 
track of music, you’ll need to do it another way. (You could attach the G1 to 
your computer, transfer the files you want to send, and send the e-mail from 
the PC, for example. See Chapter 17 for details on how to connect the G1 to a 
computer.)
To attach pictures to an e-mail:
 
1. While editing an e-mail, push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the Attach menu item.
 
 The Pictures application is called up, showing all pictures currently 
stored on your device.
 
3. Select a picture.
 
 You return to the e-mail editing screen, where you see a new section 
added between the Subject and body boxes. The new section shows a 
paper clip (it’s an attachment, get it?), the file name of the attachment, 
its size, and an X icon (see Figure 6-8). Touching X removes the attach-
ment.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1–3 to attach additional pictures.

Viewing received attachments
People probably e-mail you all sorts of attachments — pictures are just the 
tip of the iceberg. Maybe you get the occasional PDF file, Word document, or 
Excel spreadsheet. Even though the G1 doesn’t have built-in applications for 
viewing or editing common document types, it has a neat trick up its sleeve: 
The G1 leans on Google to convert them into a format it can read.
This is how the process works: When you try to open an attachment that the 
G1 doesn’t understand, it asks Google to convert it into HyperText Markup 
Language (HTML), which is the same code used to design and create Web 
pages. The G1 handles HTML like a pro, so once Google converts the docu-
ment, you can view it right away. The most popular document types are 
supported, such as PDF, Microsoft Office, Rich Text Format (RTF), and 
OpenOffice.
When an e-mail you receive contains an attachment, you’ll see a paper clip on 
its row in your Inbox, as shown in Figure 6-9.
Reading the e-mail as you normally would reveals one or more gray sections 
with paper clips to the left — these are your attachments. Picture attach-
ments (see Figure 6-10) display Download and Preview icons; Download 
stores the picture on your G1 and shows it to you, but Preview simply shows 
it to you without downloading. Document attachments cannot be down-
loaded, so they display only a Preview icon (see Figure 6-11).

Even though documents can’t be saved to your G1, it’s not a problem! As long 
as your phone is attached to a cellular or Wi-Fi network, you have access to 
Gmail — which in turn means you have access to all of these attachments by 
previewing them. Gmail’s mantra of “don’t delete e-mail; just archive it” defi-
nitely applies here.
 
If you like a picture you’ve just received, you can set it as your wallpaper, a 
contact icon, or a myFaves icon in a jiffy. When you’re looking at the image 
after touching Download or Preview, push the Menu button and touch Set as. 
You are presented with a new menu where you can choose what you’d like to 
do with the picture. (I get into these options in more detail in Chapter 11 when 
we look at Android’s Pictures application.)

Gmail Settings screen
You access a handful of options for the Gmail application from its Settings 
screen. You can get to Gmail’s Settings screen, shown in Figure 6-12, from 
the Inbox or any other label view by pushing the Menu button and touching 
Settings.
 
Figure 6-12: 
The Gmail 
Settings 
screen.
 

90
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
The Setting screen is divided into two sections, General settings and 
Notification settings. Let’s take a look at what’s available in the General set-
tings section:
 
✓ Signature: Touching this option brings up a small box where you can 
type some text that is added to the bottom of every e-mail you send 
from your G1.
 
 
A common signature people use is Sent from my G1 or Sent from my 
phone. That way, your recipients are forgiving when you write an e-mail 
that’s more terse than usual. (As good as the G1’s keyboard is, you’d 
still rather not write a novel on it if you can avoid it.)
 
✓ Labels: This menu item lets you choose which labels’ contents are auto-
matically transferred to your G1. It’s nice to have as much of your e-mail 
available on your phone as possible, but doing so is a trade-off: synchro-
nizing more means more storage is required on the phone and more 
wireless data is used.
 
 Fortunately, a compromise is available. When you’re looking at the list 
of labels to be synchronized, touching one will toggle it between three 
settings, shown to the right of the label name: Sync all, Sync recent, and 
Don’t sync (you won’t see any text to the right of the label name when 
this option is selected). So if you have thousands of e-mails with your 
Work label, for example, you can choose the Sync recent option to avoid 
pulling down that mother lode to the phone.
 
 E-mails that aren’t synchronized can still be viewed and searched, but it 
just takes a bit longer because they need to be downloaded at the time 
you request them. They aren’t downloaded ahead of time.
In the next section, Notification settings, you have three options:
 
✓ Email notifications: Like many other Android applications, Gmail gives 
you the option of disabling notifications received on your status bar. 
Unless you get so many e-mails that the notifications become useless, 
you probably want to leave this enabled.
 
✓ Select ringtone: You can select a tone to play when you receive an 
e-mail. Touching an option in the list of ringtones will play it once so you 
can preview it. Touch OK to confirm your selection or Cancel to revert 
to whatever you had previously.
 
✓ Vibrate: If this option is selected, the G1 vibrates when you receive an 
e-mail. Depending on how much e-mail you get, this could turn your 
phone into a nearly full-time buzzer!

91
 Chapter 6: Using Gmail and Other E-Mail Services
The Email Application: Anything 
That Isn’t Gmail
In a perfect G1 world, you’d use your Gmail account exclusively for sending 
and receiving e-mail, but for many of us, that’s not a reasonable expectation. 
Perhaps you prefer the Web-based interface offered by another e-mail service 
such as Hotmail or Yahoo! Mail. Or maybe your job or school requires you to 
use another type of account. Whatever the reason, Android’s Email applica-
tion has you covered.
Specifically, Email supports any POP3- or IMAP-based e-mail server that can 
be accessed over the Internet. This covers an overwhelming majority of the 
world’s e-mail servers. If your e-mail service has a Web site, go to it and look 
for a Help section on configuring e-mail clients (or talk to a customer service 
representative or administrator). Email can automatically configure popular 
e-mail services, but if you use a lesser-known or private service, you need to 
gather some details to use the application.
Setting up an e-mail account
To set up an e-mail account, begin by going to the Applications tab and 
choosing Email. The first time you start the Email application, you are 
prompted to set up an account, as shown in Figure 6-13.
 
Figure 6-13: 
The Email 
applica-
tion’s 
welcome 
screen.
 

92
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
1. Touch Next to begin.
 
2. Enter your e-mail address and password where indicated (see Fig-
ure 6-14).
 
Figure 6-14: 
Enter your 
full e-mail 
address and 
password.
 
 
 From this information, the G1 decides whether it knows how to automat-
ically configure the account. If it does, you’re in luck — no further setup 
is necessary and you can start using your account right away. If the G1 
doesn’t recognize the account type, however, you’ll have to manually 
enter some details.
 
 If you know that the application won’t recognize your account type 
(if your company controls a private e-mail server, for example), you 
can prevent the phone from even trying to automatically configure 
the account by touching the Manual setup icon in the lower left of the 
screen.
 
 For this example, I’m using a type of e-mail account that I know the G1 
won’t recognize: one of Yahoo Mail’s lesser-used domains, ymail.com. 
That way, I can walk you through the process of setting up an account 
manually.
Enterprise e-mail, Android, and you
At the time of publication, Android doesn’t 
support enterprise e-mail services such as 
Microsoft Exchange or BlackBerry Enterprise 
Server. However, the odds are very high that 
this will be resolved soon, either by Google or 
by any number of third-party companies offer-
ing add-on software. In the meantime, if you use 
one of these services to get your work e-mail, 
talk to your system administrator to see if he or 
she can forward your e-mail to another account 
such as your Gmail account. Although the sys 
administrator might not be willing to forward 
e-mail to another account because it’s consid-
ered a security risk, asking is worth a shot.

93
 Chapter 6: Using Gmail and Other E-Mail Services
 
3. Touch Next.
 
4. Choose the type of account, POP3 or IMAP.
 
 IMAP is the more advanced type of e-mail server because it supports 
synchronization — if you read an e-mail on your PC, it appears as read 
on your G1 and vice versa. However, not all e-mail services support 
IMAP.
 
 I chose POP3 here, but the IMAP steps are basically the same.
 
5. Fill in the incoming server settings:
 
a. Fill in the incoming e-mail server’s username and password.
 
 At the top of the screen, the application has taken a guess at your 
incoming e-mail server’s username and password based on the 
address and password you entered when you first started the 
setup process. If these are incorrect, you can change them here.
 
b. Enter the address of the incoming e-mail server and port.
 
 In the next area of the screen, the application has also tried to 
guess the address of your incoming e-mail server and the port it 
should try to connect to. Because these addresses vary widely 
from service to service, odds are good that it guessed incorrectly, 
so pay close attention to these fields.
 
c. Choose a Security type.
 
 Near the bottom of the screen, you’re asked to choose the type of 
security. This is the type of encryption the application uses when 
connecting to your server. Encryption is almost always a good 
thing, especially for something as private and personal as your 
e-mail. If your service offers encryption, it’s good to select it here. 
The type of security you choose depends on your service.
 
d. If you have a POP3 account, choose whether e-mail should ever 
be deleted from the server.
 
 At the very bottom of the screen, if you are configuring a POP3 
account, you’ll be asked whether e-mail should ever be deleted 
from the server. If you choose Never, deleting an e-mail from your 
G1 will have no effect on your e-mail server — in other words, the 
e-mail will still be available to download to your PC or wherever 
else you may view it. If you choose After 7 days or When I delete 
from Inbox, be careful — you may encounter a situation where 
an e-mail gets downloaded only to your phone, and that can be a 
problem if you like to have all your e-mail available on your PC 
as well.

94
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
6. Touch Next to continue the configuration.
 
7. Fill out the outgoing server settings:
 
a. Enter the address of your outgoing e-mail server.
 
 This is often, but not always, different from the address of your 
incoming server.
 
b. Below that, enter the port to connect to along with the security 
type, just as you did for the incoming server. 
 
 The application takes a stab at guessing the address and port, but 
as before, verify these carefully — they’re quite likely incorrect.
 
c. At the bottom, specify whether the outgoing server requires sign-
in, and if so, the username and password to use.
 
8. Touch Next.
 
9. Choose your account options.
 
 Here, the application gives you an opportunity to set some basic 
options:
 
• Email checking frequency: Because the Email application doesn’t 
support the same push technology that the Gmail application does, 
you can configure Email to poll your server on a regular basis to 
check for new e-mail. This option is set to Never by default, mean-
ing the G1 will not check for e-mail on this account unless you 
explicitly ask it to. You can change this setting so that e-mail is 
automatically retrieved at intervals ranging from every 5 minutes 
to once per hour.
 
 
Choosing a frequent interval (such as 5 minutes) increases bat-
tery drain, which means you’ll have less use of your G1 between 
charges. Select a less frequent setting for better battery life; to 
really maximize battery life, choose Never and just check for new 
e-mails manually.
 
• Send email from this account by default: If you select this option, 
the G1 automatically uses this e-mail account whenever you send an 
e-mail from elsewhere in the phone (from contacts, for example).
 
• Notify me when email arrives: This option functions similarly to the 
notification feature for Gmail. When selected, you’ll receive notifica-
tion in the status bar that you have new e-mail (but only if you have 
your Email checking frequency set to something besides Never).
 
 Don’t fret over these options too much — you can always change them 
later.
 
10. Touch Next.
 
11. If you want, enter an optional name for the account. 
 
 The optional name is useful if you intend to set up multiple e-mail accounts.

95
 Chapter 6: Using Gmail and Other E-Mail Services
 
12. Enter the name you want attached to e-mails you send. 
 
 By default, your first and last name is used here, but you’re free to 
change it.
 
13. Touch Done.
 
 You are taken to your Inbox for this account.
Retrieving new e-mail
If you have the Email application set up to automatically retrieve e-mail at a 
particular interval, you’ll start to receive notifications in the status bar for 
this account (unless you’ve disabled the notifications). Figure 6-15 shows a 
notification from the Email application. In this example, the notification is for 
a Gmail account that I have set up in the Email application — even though a 
dedicated Gmail application is available, nothing is stopping you from con-
figuring Gmail accounts in the Email application as well! This capability is 
particularly handy if you use multiple Gmail accounts, since the Gmail appli-
cation supports only one.
 
Figure 6-15: 
A new 
e-mail notifi-
cation from 
Android’s 
Email 
application.
 
 
Note that when an e-mail arrives, Gmail shows an @ symbol in the status bar 
but Email shows an envelope with a small @ symbol above it and to the right. 
This helps you distinguish at a glance whether the new e-mail is from Gmail or 
another e-mail account.

96
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
Touching the notification takes you to your Inbox (see Figure 6-16). This 
is one way to start the Email application, but you can start it also from the 
Applications tab; now that you have an account set up, the application will 
take you straight to your Inbox instead of prompting you to set up a new 
account.
 
Figure 6-16:

tion’s Inbox

The display here is similar to, but not exactly the same as, the Gmail applica-
tion’s Inbox. Unread emails have a thin vertical green bar to their left and a 
bold typeface.
You can retrieve new e-mail from your Inbox by pushing the Menu button and 
choosing Refresh.
About folders
You’ll notice that the Inbox row is at the top level while e-mails below it are 
indented. That’s because these e-mails are within the Inbox folder. Unlike 
the Gmail application, which presents different labels in different screens 
altogether, the Email application presents them all in one screen as separate 
folders. If you’re using an IMAP account, you may see several folders here 
in addition to the Inbox — these were automatically pulled down from your 
server, and you may recognize them as the same folders you see when you 
access this account from your PC.
You can expand and collapse these folders by touching them. If you start an 
e-mail and save it as a draft, a Drafts folder is created. And if you delete an 
e-mail, a Trash folder is created.

 Chapter 6: Using Gmail and Other E-Mail Services
Reading and working with e-mail
The process for reading and managing your e-mail in the Email application is 
similar to the process in Gmail, except for a few missing options specific to 
Gmail, such as Change labels and Mark as spam. At the bottom of each e-mail, 
you still have access to the Reply, Reply all, and Delete icons, which work as 
you’d expect. You can also push the Menu button from within an e-mail to 
Reply, Reply to all, Forward, Delete, or Mark an e-mail as unread.
If you’re looking at the Inbox view, you can touch and hold on an e-mail to 
call up a menu of actions that you can perform on that e-mail:
 
✓ Open: This option simply opens the e-mail — it’s no different from 
touching an e-mail in the Inbox list.
 
✓ Delete: The Delete option sends the e-mail to the Trash folder and 
removes it from the Inbox.
 
✓ Forward, Reply all, and Reply: These items create new e-mails based on 
the e-mail you’ve selected — they work as you’d expect.
 
✓ Mark as unread/Mark as read: If you’ve selected a read e-mail, this will 
mark it as unread, and vice versa.
These options are pretty much the same as the menu items you see when 
you push Menu from within an e-mail itself (see Figure 6-17).

available 
when touch-
ing and 
holding on 
an e-mail.

Viewing attachments
Gmail has the luxury of relying on Google’s servers to turn document attach-
ments into HTML that can be processed and displayed by your G1, but 
attachment viewing options are much more limited in the Email application. 
If you come across an e-mail with a document attachment, it will look some-
thing like Figure 6-18.
 
Figure 6-18: 
An attach-
ment that 
can’t be 
viewed 
or saved. 
Bummer!
 
You can see the attachment’s name and size, but you can’t view it — you’ll 
need to return to desktop-computer-land for that.
On the other hand, picture attachments can still be viewed and saved. When 
you get one, you’ll see Open and Save icons to the right of the attachment — 
these icons work the same as the Preview and Download icons, respectively, 
when looking at a picture attachment in Gmail.
Writing and sending e-mails
The process of writing and sending e-mails from the Email application works 
pretty much like the process in the Gmail application, which is nice since 
you won’t have to remember two ways to go about things if you find yourself 
using both apps.
To compose a new e-mail from scratch, push the Menu button from the Inbox 
view and touch Compose. Otherwise, you can reply to or forward an existing 
e-mail, but in any case, you’ll arrive at a screen that looks like Figure 6-19.

99
 Chapter 6: Using Gmail and Other E-Mail Services
 
Figure 6-19: 
Composing 
a new 
e-mail.
 
All the same rules from Gmail apply here. You can send this e-mail to mul-
tiple recipients by separating them with commas, and as you type new recipi-
ents, your G1 will attempt to match your typing to names or addresses stored 
in your contacts — just touch a match to select it and the rest of the address 
will be filled out for you.
By pushing the Menu button from this screen, you can add CC and BCC boxes 
or add picture attachments (the menu item may appear as “Add attachm…”, 
but you get the idea). You can also send the message, save it as a draft (in 
which case it’ll appear in your Drafts folder from the Inbox view), or discard 
your new message. These final three options are also available as icons at the 
bottom of the message, so there’s no need to push Menu to access them as 
long as they’re visible on the screen.
Working with multiple accounts
Since Email can support multiple accounts at the same time, there has to be 
a good way to manage them, right? Indeed, there is — and it’s just one menu 
item away. When you’re looking at the Inbox view for a particular e-mail 
account, push the Menu button and choose Accounts. You’ll see a screen 
that looks like Figure 6-20.
By touching and holding a particular account in this list, you’ll be presented 
with three menu items:
 
✓ Open: This menu option returns you to the Inbox view for the selected 
account. It performs the same function as simply touching the account 
name.

100
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
✓ Account settings: This option lets you modify the settings you config-
ured when you first went through the setup for this account, such as the 
name to display when sending e-mails from this account and the incom-
ing and outgoing server information. The Account settings screen can be 
accessed also from the Inbox screen for a particular account by pushing 
Menu and choosing Account settings.
 
✓ Remove account: This option deletes the selected account from your 
list of accounts. You won’t be able to access it unless you set it up again.
 
Figure 6-20: 
Your e-mail 
accounts.
 
By pushing the Menu button from the account list, you can refresh (that is, 
get new e-mail for) all the listed accounts, add a new account, or compose a 
new e-mail. If you choose Compose, the e-mail account that you have speci-
fied as your default is used to send the message.

nside your G1 are three amazing pieces of hardware (well, way more than 
three amazing pieces of hardware are in there, but three are of particular 
interest to us in this chapter): a GPS receiver, a magnetic compass, and a 
three-axis accelerometer. Combined, these guts make the G1 one of the most 
powerful phones ever to support navigation. Let’s look at these three compo-
nents in a little more detail. 
 
✓ GPS receiver: The GPS receiver listens to signals from GPS (Global 
Positioning System), an extensive constellation of satellites covering 
the globe that devices can use to determine your precise coordinates 
anywhere in the world. If you have a navigation system in your car or 
a handheld navigation system made by a company such as Garmin or 
Magellan, or you’ve been on an airliner in the past couple of decades, 
you’re well-acquainted with the benefits of GPS!
 
✓ Magnetic compass: There’s a problem with GPS, though — it can deter-
mine only where you are, not what direction you’re facing. (Some GPS 
devices can figure out your direction by measuring the direction trav-
eled between two nearby locations, but that works only when you’re 
moving, not when you’re standing still.) The G1’s magnetic compass 
is truly unprecedented for a phone of any kind. Several other phones 
offer compasses, but there’s a big difference: Unlike other models, the 
G1 allows makers of applications to tap into the data in the compass 
and use it. The G1’s compass allows the phone to determine where it’s 
pointed, and applications (like Maps, for example) can use that direc-
tional information to do cool things.

102
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
✓ Accelerometer: The final piece of the puzzle is the G1’s three-axis accel-
erometer. “Three-axis accelerometer” is quite a mouthful but means one 
simple thing: The G1 can figure out whether you are holding it with the 
screen facing up, down, left, right, or at a strange angle. The accelerom-
eter comes in handy in the Maps application — you’ll see why a little 
later in this chapter — and it also lets you control some downloadable 
applications and games just by moving your G1 around!
Many of us have used Google Maps on our PCs at one time or another to find 
an address on a map, get directions from one location to another, or just play 
around with its super-cool satellite and street-level views. The three tech-
nologies I just described — the GPS, compass, and accelerometer — come 
together to make Maps on the G1 even cooler than on your PC because the 
G1 can use the information from these technologies to determine your cur-
rent situation and integrate it into what you’re seeing on the map right now.
In this chapter, I show you how to make absolutely, positively sure you’re 
never lost again (well, as long as you have your G1 with you) by taking full 
advantage of Android’s integrated Maps application.
Starting Maps
Normally, you start the Maps application from its icon in the Applications 
tab or a shortcut on the Home screen (if you’ve created one), but you can 
also start it directly from a postal address on a Web page in the Browser or 
a contact’s details screen in the Contacts tab of the Dialer application. If you 
have assigned a postal address to a contact, you can open Maps and immedi-
ately show the address on the map by simply touching it — a handy way to 
quickly see the address of a business or home that you’re traveling to. (And 
yes, Maps can tell you exactly how to get there, too! More on that later in the 
chapter.)
Getting Around Maps
When you first open Maps, you see a screen similar to Figure 7-1. If you’ve 
ever used Google Maps on your PC, this view should be familiar; it’s simply 
Google’s rendered map of streets, highways, and other navigational aids.

103
 Chapter 7: Navigating with Google Maps
 
Figure 7-1: 
The Maps 
application.
 
Scrolling the map
To scroll around the map, you can press and hold on the screen and then 
move your finger; the map moves as your finger moves. If you prefer to navi-
gate with the trackball (this is especially convenient if you have the keyboard 
open), just roll the trackball and the map moves.
While using your finger, you can also flick the map. To do this, make sure 
your finger is still moving along the map when it loses contact with the 
screen, and you’ll see that the map continues to move for a while in the direc-
tion your finger was moving. After a moment, the map decelerates and even-
tually comes to a stop. (Flicking sounds complicated, but you’ll find that it 
becomes a natural motion once you’ve tried it a few times.)
As you scroll around the map, you might find that new areas that have just 
scrolled onto the screen are displayed as a checkerboard pattern (see Fig-
ure 7-2) that is eventually replaced by the map you’re expecting to see. 
This happens because the G1 doesn’t keep all map information in its 
memory — that would take way too much space! Instead, the Maps applica-
tion asks Google for the new parts of the map that are now needed to display. 
Depending on the speed of your data connection, this display can take any-
where from less than a second to as much as ten seconds or more.

104

Figure 7-2:

loading.
 
Zooming
Depending on what you’re doing, you’ll want to see the map at a different 
level of zoom. For example, if you’re looking at New York City and you need 
to see San Francisco, you won’t flick the screen to the left at the same zoom 
level you were using to get an up-close look at Manhattan (unless you have 
an entire day to kill). Instead, you’d want to zoom out a whole bunch, move 
over to northern California, and zoom back in.
Zooming in Maps is a cinch, and you can do it in several ways. By touch-
ing the screen while the map is showing, you bring up zoom controls at the 
bottom (see Figure 7-3) that you can touch to zoom in and out. The magnify-
ing glass with the plus sign zooms in one level, and the magnifying glass with 
the minus sign zooms out one level.
You can call up the zoom controls also by pushing Menu, selecting the More 
menu item, and selecting Zoom from the list that appears. Finally, you can 
avoid touching the screen at all: Press the Menu key and the Z key at the 
same time, move the trackball left and right to select the zoom in or zoom out 
command, respectively, and then press the trackball to execute the zoom.

Four Maps, One Application
The default map that you see when you open Maps is convenient, and it’s 
often the easiest way to see streets and other navigational features when 
you’re walking or driving to a destination. However, the Maps application 
supports four — count ’em four — map modes.
To choose a map mode, push the Menu button while looking at a map and 
select the Map mode menu item. You are presented with the list of map 
modes; just select one to switch to it. Let’s take a closer look at what each of 
these modes does, how they look, how they behave, and when you might use 
them.
Map mode
The default map mode, which you’ve already seen in Figures 7-1 and 7-3, is 
known simply as Map. It’s as good of a description as any because this is the 
most useful mode and will likely be the one that you spend the most time 
using. The Map mode is best equated to the style of map you might carry 
with you in your car’s glove box — it highlights roads, parks, airports, and 
other major navigational features without any unnecessary clutter.
As you zoom in and out in this mode, Maps increases and decreases the level 
of detail to the appropriate amount for the current zoom level; for example, 
if you’re zoomed all the way out so that you’re looking at the entire United 

106
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
States on the screen, you’ll see nothing but state names, borders, major 
cities, large bodies of water, and a few national parks (indicated in green). If 
you zoom in so that you’re looking at a single block in Chicago, though, you’ll 
see individual street names, the directions of one-way streets, subway sta-
tions, and the shapes of buildings.
Satellite mode
The Satellite map mode (see Figure 7-4) uses Google’s extensive collection 
of satellite imagery to supplement the standard Map mode. Instead of seeing 
nondescript gray and white areas around streets, you see buildings and 
terrain as snapped by photo satellites circling the globe. (It’s amazing that 
they can get such great shots from way, way up there, isn’t it?) In this mode, 
streets and street names are overlaid with a little bit of translucency on the 
imagery so that they don’t obstruct the terrain underneath.
 
Figure 7-4: 
The Satellite 
map mode.
 
This mode can be cluttered for day-to-day navigation use, but sometimes it 
can be convenient (or just plain cool) to be able to see landmarks near the 
area you’re looking for.
Because different parts of the world were photographed by different satel-
lites (or, in some cases, by the same satellite but with different levels of 
zoom), not every corner of the globe is available in Satellite mode at the clos-
est zoom levels. If you zoom in beyond what Maps can provide, you see a 
screen of X symbols above a checkerboard, as in Figure 7-5. Just zoom back 
out a level or two to continue on your virtual journey.

107
 Chapter 7: Navigating with Google Maps

ing at isn’t

Traffic mode
Another fantastic feature of Google Maps that you may already be used to 
from using it on your PC is the ability to show traffic conditions on major 
highways and byways. Well, good news: That same capability is available to 
you right from the comfort and convenience of your G1.
The Traffic map mode (see Figure 7-6) is essentially the same as the Map 
map mode, with one important distinction — roads for which Google can 
get traffic information are displayed as color-coded superimposed lines. The 
information comes from a variety of sources, which Google aggregates and 
updates every few minutes. These roads are shown in any of the following 
colors:
 
✓ Green: Traffic is moving at 50 miles per hour or better.
 
✓ Yellow: Traffic is slowed, moping along at somewhere between 25 and 
50 miles per hour.
 
✓ Red: Ouch! Things are jammed here, with average speeds below 25 miles 
per hour.
 
✓ Gray: Although Google usually receives traffic data for this road, no cur-
rent data is available. Don’t blame Maps if you travel to this road and 
discover that the traffic has turned it into a parking lot!

Street View mode
If you’ve been wondering where the G1’s magnetic compass and accelerom-
eter come into play, here’s your answer. Street View takes you right down 
to a perspective view of the location you’re looking at on the map — just 
as though you were standing there! To make this happen, Google has taken 
the incredible step of deploying fleets of camera-equipped cars around the 
United States to snap pictures everywhere they go. As you can imagine, this 
is a massive, time-consuming undertaking. At the time of this writing, Street 
View was available in 69 metropolitan areas of the United States, but that 
number is growing and existing Street Views are frequently updated with 
fresh pictures.
Enabling Street View and taking full advantage of it takes a few steps:
 
1. Choose Street View from the Map mode menu.
 
 You see a map that looks essentially the same as the Map map mode, 
but streets that have Street View enabled are highlighted with a blue 
outline.
 
2. Find a location that you’d like to see at street level, and tap twice on 
the screen in that location.

109
 Chapter 7: Navigating with Google Maps
 
 You see a message that the Maps application is searching for a Street 
View for that location. After a moment, the address of the location 
you’ve tapped appears, along with a message to “Press here to enter 
Street View,” as shown in Figure 7-7.
 
Figure 7-7: 
A Street 
View is 
available 
at this 
location.
 
 
3. Touch the message where the address appears.
 
 This is where the magic starts to happen. You are transported to a 
street-level view of the location you tapped (see Figure 7-8). Translucent 
lines indicate streets that can be navigated in Street View mode. By 
touching an arrow on any one of the lines, you are moved in that direc-
tion, facing the same direction as the arrow. As you encounter streets, 
you can touch their labels to move to a Street View on that street. You 
can also zoom the Street View by touching (or selecting with the track-
ball) the magnifying glass icons at the bottom of the screen.
At this point, you have two ways to navigate around Street View. By default, 
you can look up, down, and around by moving your finger around on the 
screen or by scrolling the trackball. That’s not the cool way, though! By 
enabling Compass mode, the G1 will use its compass and accelerometer data 
to automatically position the Street View based on the direction you’re facing 
and the way you’re holding the phone. Here’s how to enable Compass mode:
 
1. While in Street View, push the Menu button.

110
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
2. Select the Compass mode menu item.
 
 A brief message indicates that the Compass mode is now on.
 
3. Move in a circle and tilt the G1 up and down.
 
 You’ll notice that the view responds to your movements — you see 
exactly what you’d be seeing if you were standing at that location! 
 
4. To stop the G1 from responding to your movements and return to tra-
ditional trackball navigation of Street View, repeat Steps 1 and 2.
 
Figure 7-8: 
Street View, 
showing an 
intersection 
and touch-
able street 
labels.
 
 
If you’re trying to find an unfamiliar location, you can use Street View to 
“visualize” your destination before you even get there. Just go to Street View 
for the address you’re looking for, enable Compass mode, and walk around to 
get a real sense of the area before you arrive; that way, you’ll be familiar with 
landmarks ahead of time.
If you see an inappropriate or incorrect image while browsing Street View 
(hey, it happens — we’re talking about millions of images of real locations!), 
push the Menu button and select the Report image button. You’ll be taken to 
a Web page in the Browser that lets you tell Google about the problem.
To return to the map from Street View, just push the Back button or push 
Menu and select the Go to map item.

111
 Chapter 7: Navigating with Google Maps
While you’re looking at the map, you can drag the Street View man icon 
around to choose a new location to view — just touch his icon and move 
your finger around the screen (see Figure 7-9). Wherever you let go is where 
the Maps application will look for a Street View next.

Finding Where You Are
I told you at the beginning of the chapter that as long as you had your G1 
with you, you’d never be lost again — but so far, nothing you’ve done in the 
Maps application has involved your location. You’ve just scrolled through 
the different map modes, looking at interesting buildings (and in the case of 
Street View, maybe an interesting person or two), but none of this cool stuff 
necessarily tells you where you’re currently standing.
So how do you find out where the heck you are? It’s a piece of cake! From 
any map mode, push the Menu button and select the My Location menu item. 
After a moment, the map moves so that your current location is in the center, 
represented by a blue dot.
You may notice a light blue circle around the blue dot (see Figure 7-10). This 
happens when the G1 is unable to determine your precise location but can 
say with reasonable certainty that you’re somewhere within the blue tinted 
area.

112
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
Figure 7-10: 
The Maps 
applica-
tion knows

somewhere 
within the 
blue tinted 
circle.
 
 
By default, the GPS hardware in the G1 is turned off to conserve battery life. 
The Maps application can usually still determine your location but with less 
accuracy. GPS is enabled using the Settings application, which I cover in 
Chapter 15.
Assisted GPS: The G1’s secret sauce for getting 
around poor GPS reception
Why does the tinted blue circle sometimes 
appear after selecting My Location? Why 
doesn’t the G1 always know exactly where 
you are? GPS satellites require a direct, unob-
structed, line-of-sight view. Reception can be 
impossible if you’re indoors or surrounded by 
tall buildings. (In fact, GPS was never designed 
to work with cellphones, so it’s impressive that 
GPS works as well as it does.) You generally 
get the blue tint because you don’t currently 
have great (or any) reception with GPS satel-
lites. To make up for a lack of satellite recep-
tion, the G1 makes use of a combination of 
technologies that are together known as aGPS 
(assisted GPS). aGPS combines traditional GPS 
reception with a known database of Wi-Fi and 
cellular tower locations to help the G1 take an 
educated guess at your approximate location. 
You’ll be surprised at just how accurate that 
guess usually is.

113
 Chapter 7: Navigating with Google Maps
What can you do with your location information once the Maps application 
has it? Touching the blue dot reveals the Details screen shown in Figure 7-11. 
The Details screen lists your exact coordinates and the following options:
 
✓ Zoom in to My Location: Takes you all the way down to the closest 
zoom level available on the map and centers it on your location.
 
✓ Directions to this address: Takes you to the Directions screen and auto-
matically enters your location as the destination. (I discuss directions in 
detail later in the “Getting Directions” section.)
 
 
The Directions to this address option is handy for guiding someone 
on the phone to your current location — just get the person’s current 
address and use it as the starting location.
 
✓ Directions from this address: Takes you to the Directions screen and 
enters your location as the starting address.
 
✓ Edit My Location settings: Opens the My Location settings in the 
Settings application, which we look at in Chapter 15.
 
✓ Disable My Location: Removes the blue dot from the map. (You can 
always get it back by pushing Menu while looking at the map and choos-
ing the My Location menu item.)

Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
Searching for Locations
The Maps application is every bit as adept at searching for business names, 
addresses, points of interest, and categories of locations as its PC equivalent. 
It’s not a stretch to say that you have the power of every Yellow Pages and 
White Pages in the world stuffed into an object that slips into your pocket, 
which is pretty amazing.
To perform a search for locations:
 
1. Push the Menu button and select the Search menu item.
 
 Alternatively, you can just press the Search key. Or even better, just 
start typing. Maps will know that you’re trying to conduct a search.
 
 A search bar appears at the top of the screen (see Figure 7-12). Recent 
searches appear in a list directly below the text box. If you want to 
repeat one of these searches, you can just touch it and the search 
begins immediately. Otherwise, continue to Step 2.
 
Figure 7-12: 
The Maps 
applica-
tion’s 
search bar.

Recent searches
 
2. Begin typing your search.
 
 Your search can be in the form of a street address, a city name, a 
business name, a category (such as “pizza”), or a contact name for 
which you’ve entered one or more street addresses. As you type, your 
search history starts to be filtered so that only items that match what 
you’re entering are visible. You also see any contact names with street 
addresses that match your search. If you see what you’re searching for, 
touching it will start the search.

115
 Chapter 7: Navigating with Google Maps
 
3. When you’ve finished typing your search, press the Enter key or touch 
the Search icon on the screen.
Viewing search results as a list
The search you’ve run in the last section takes a moment to finish as the 
Maps application asks Google for information. When the query is complete, 
if there’s only one possible match, you are taken directly to it in the Map 
view; otherwise, you are presented with a list of possible matches (see Fig-
ure 7-13). Generally, Maps looks for matches in the vicinity of wherever you 
happened to be looking on the map when you ran the search, but if you typed 
a specific address or city, it does its best to look in the correct area.
 
Figure 7-13: 
A list of pos-
sible search 
matches.
 
At this point, you can touch a match to show it (and center it) on the map, or 
you can touch and hold on a match for a moment to get a pop-up menu. This 
menu has the following options:
 
✓ Zoom in to address: The first option zooms the map all the way in and 
centers the selected match. This option is the same as simply touching 
the match’s row.
 
✓ Directions to here/directions from here: This option takes you to the 
Directions screen and enters the selected match as the destination 
address or starting address, respectively.

116
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
✓ Add as contact: Because Google Maps is frequently able to gather the 
full name, street address, and phone number of the search matches that 
it returns, touching this menu item conveniently turns the match into a 
new contact in your contacts list.
Viewing search results on the map
At the bottom of your search results list are two buttons. Touching the 
button on the left, Edit search, simply allows you to tweak your search terms 
and run the search again (remember, pizza has two z’s). The button on the 
right, Show map, takes you back to your map view with all the matches in the 
list added as pushpins (see Figure 7-14).

Search matches
To choose a specific match, touch its pushpin — an information bubble 
appears above it with the match’s name and street address. You can also 
navigate sequentially from one match to the next by using the right and left 
arrows that appear on either side of the information bubble.
Once you’ve located the match that you’re interested in, touching its infor-
mation bubble will take you a Details screen. (You may remember a similar

call its primary phone number, use it as the destination or starting point to 
get directions, add it as a contact for quick dialing in the future, and — if 
available — open the Browser to visit its Web site.
Getting Directions
The true beauty of the Maps application isn’t just that it shows you the loca-
tion of things (including you) — it’s that it’ll show you how to get there, too. 
In this chapter, you’ve seen several ways that the locations you work with in 
Maps can be used as the starting points or destinations for getting turn-by-
turn directions. In this section, I show you exactly how that feature works.
If you select the Directions to here or Directions from here menu item that 
you’ve seen elsewhere in Maps, you’re already at the Directions screen (see 
Figure 7-15) with a location entered into one of its two fields. Otherwise, you 
can push the Menu button and select the Directions menu item to get here.

and destination
At the bottom of the screen are two text boxes; the top one is your starting 
point, and the bottom one is your destination. These boxes work a lot like 
a location search does: You can enter a street address, a business or city 
name, a contact name, an airport code (such as ORD or SFO), and so on. As 
you type, Maps looks through your search history and your contacts, and if 
it finds any potential matches, it offers them to you in a list. You can either 
select an item from the list or continue typing.

118
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
To the left of the text boxes, you’ll notice a button with up and down arrows. 
Touching this will simply swap the contents of top and bottom boxes, revers-
ing the starting point and destination.
 
Touching the button to the right of the text boxes will allow you to select your 
current location, an address from your contacts, or a search term from your 
Maps history to fill out the boxes. This feature is a nice little shortcut to avoid 
entering text unnecessarily.
When you have filled out the text boxes, touch the Route button on the far 
right side. Google calculates the directions for you and, after a moment, 
displays a list of turn-by-turn directions to reach your destination (see 
Figure 7-16).
 
Figure 7-16: 
Turn-by-turn 
directions 
from San 
Francisco 
to New 
York — one 
heck of a 
drive.
 
The first and last items in the list are your starting point and destination, 
respectively. In the middle you have each turn (or other driving instruc-
tion) that you need to follow. On the right, the distance before the following 
instruction is listed. At the very bottom, you see the total distance and esti-
mated drive time (subject to bathroom breaks, of course).
To see your route highlighted in blue on the map, touch the Show map 
button at the bottom of the screen. Alternatively, you can touch a specific 
instruction to see the location of that instruction zoomed in and centered on 

119
 Chapter 7: Navigating with Google Maps
the map. Once you’re looking at the map, each turn point is highlighted by a 
diamond in a white circle; touching one of these points will show the textual 
instructions that accompany it inside a bubble (see Figure 7-17). You can 
move backward and forward through the instructions by touching the left 
and right arrows, respectively, or you can return to the list of directions by 
touching the icon in the lower-right corner of the screen.
 
Although the Directions feature is designed mainly for car use, note that 
unlike an in-car navigation system, the Maps application will not automatically 
advance from one instruction to the next as you drive (you have to do that 
yourself). In addition, the app will not speak the instructions to you — you 
need to look down at the screen to see what’s going on. Obviously, these activ-
ities are not safe for a driver who’s trying to pilot a car at roadway speeds. 
Please, for your own sake (and for mine, if I’m ever near you on the road), let a 
copilot perform these actions for you!
When you’re finished with your route, you can push the Menu button and 
select the Clear map menu item to remove the route from the screen and 
return to the normal map mode.

If there’s one G1 application that turns you into a superhero, it’s Maps — 
you’ll never be lost, you’ll always know where to find what you’re looking for, 
and if you’re feeling generous, you’ll be the one who can bail out that help-
less looking tourist who can’t find the highway. And, hey — isn’t it a good 
feeling to know that you’ll be able to find a Vietnamese restaurant the next 
time you’re in Dubuque, Iowa? (Hint: It’s the Asian Gourmet.) 

Chapter 8
Contacts
In This Chapter 
▶ Getting to a contact quickly
▶ Creating and managing contacts
▶ Using contact information to send e-mail, text messages, and more
▶ Working with the Contacts Settings screen
W
hen you turned on your G1 for the very first time and entered your 
Google account information, something magical happened: All the 
contacts stored in your Google account were downloaded automatically. 
Even if you weren’t actively using Google’s contacts feature before, as long 
as you were using Gmail, Google was quietly collecting the names and e-mail 
addresses of people you e-mailed (and who e-mailed you) and filing them 
away in your contacts list. Granted, that’s not all the information you need 
about the people you need to contact — and odds are lots of people are in 
there who you’ll never be contacting again — but it’s a start!
Even if you didn’t have a Google account previously or weren’t using Gmail, 
creating an account and actively using your G1 puts you on a fabulous path 
to address book nirvana. Why? Unlike many cellphones that don’t give you 
a nice, clean way of getting your contacts into their tiny little brains, all con-
tacts you create on your G1 are automatically and silently synchronized to 
your Google account. That means two very cool things: one, the contacts are 
available on your PC simply by going to www.gmail.com and logging in, and 
two, any Android phone you ever buy in the future will be just one Google 
account login away from having all your contacts. How cool is that?
I’ve already touched on some features of the Contacts system in the G1 in 
Chapter 4, but now we’re really going to get into the nitty-gritty of what 
makes it tick.

122
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
Contacts Is an Application 
but Not Really
The Contacts application in Android has a dirty little secret: It’s not really its 
own application. Contacts is nothing more than a tab in the Dialer application 
(see Figure 8-1), which is a logical location for it considering that its primary 
function is as a repository of phone numbers.
 
Figure 8-1: 
The 
Contacts 
tab.
 
That said, Contacts is still treated like its own app in some respects. It gets 
its own icon in the Applications tab — in fact, it’s one of the default icons on 
the G1’s Home screen when you first turn on the phone. Choosing this icon 
means you’ll be taken straight to the Contacts tab in the Dialer, but you can 
get to it also by opening the Dialer application (or pushing the Send button) 
and touching the Contacts tab.
Finding Contacts
They say the world has two kinds of people: those who have a ton of contacts 
in their phone and those who are going to. Whether you’re in the first cat-
egory or the second, it’s a good idea to get a handle on how to find a contact 
quickly and efficiently, and Android gives you a few neat tools to do just that.

123
 Chapter 8: Contacts
You can just scroll through your entire list using swipes of your finger or the 
trackball, but once your contact count gets much above a hundred or two, 
you’ll find that this gets old really fast. So let’s have a look at how Android 
can help us.
The first method uses a tab to seek out a particular letter, just like those old-
fashioned Rolodexes (don’t worry, this method is a whole lot more portable 
and won’t make you look like you’re stuck in the 1980s, I promise):
 
1. Start scrolling through the list of contacts, either with the trackball or 
your finger.
 
 If you have more than one page’s worth of contacts, a gray tab appears 
on the right side of the display.
 
2. Place your finger on the gray tab and move it up or down.
 
 A letter appears in the center of the screen (see Figure 8-2) — contacts 
that start with this letter are currently scrolled into view. By moving the 
gray tab up and down, you can move through the alphabet one letter at 
a time, which has the effect of rapidly scrolling through your contacts.
 
Figure 8-2: 
Scrolling 
through 
your 
contacts, 
Rolodex-
style.
 
 
3. Once you get to the letter that your contact starts with, let go of the 
gray tab.
 
 After a moment, the tab disappears. (You can make it reappear by scroll-
ing the screen as you did in Step 1.)

124
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
4. To fine-tune your search and get to the specific contact you’re looking 
for, scroll without the gray tab using either your finger or the trackball.
The second method is more direct but requires that your keyboard be open:
 
1. With the Contacts tab open, start typing either the first or last name of 
your contact.
 
 The letters you’re typing appear in the middle of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 8-3.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Typing a 
contact’s 
name to find 
the contact 
in the list.
 
 
2. Keep typing the name until the contact you’re looking for is visible.
 
 Once you see it, you can select it as usual.
But wait — there’s one more trick for finding a contact with ease. In Google, 
your contacts are organized into groups, and the default group is called My 
Contacts. If you used Gmail before you used Android, Google automatically 
started adding frequently used contacts to your My Contacts group, so if you 
e-mail a lot of people, this group can get really big really fast.
Using the Gmail Web site on your PC, you can create new groups and add 
contacts to them; for example, you might want to have a Work group and a 
Personal group. How you name and organize these groups is up to you.
Once you have those groups set up to your liking, they automatically appear 
on your phone; you don’t have to do anything. Then you can configure your 
Contacts tab to show only the contacts from a certain group. Here’s how:
 
1. While in the Contacts tab, push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the Display group menu item.

125
 Chapter 8: Contacts
 
 You’re looking at a menu of available groups. In addition to My Contacts 
and the groups you’ve created and organized through the Gmail Web 
site, you’ll have a Contacts with phone numbers option — handy for 
quickly seeing only contacts that you can dial, considering that Gmail 
automatically adds new contacts to your list with an e-mail address 
alone.
 
3. Choose a group to display by touching it, and then touch OK.
That’s it! Your screen looks a lot cleaner now, doesn’t it? To return to 
your full list of contacts, simply repeat Steps 1 through 3, touching the 
My Contacts item from the menu.
Creating a Contact
In Chapter 4, I mention that you can start the process of creating a contact 
from the Dialer or Call log tab. You create a contact from the Dialer by enter-
ing a number, pushing Menu, and touching Add to contacts; from the Call log, 
you touch and hold an entry until the pop-up menu appears and then you 
touch Add to contacts.
These are convenient methods — particularly from the Call log function, 
where you may get a call from someone who’s not in your contacts and 
immediately realize that you’d like to add him or her. Of course, you can also 
create a new contact from scratch:
 
1. From the Contacts tab, push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch New contact.
Regardless of whether you’ve created this contact from the Dialer tab, the 
Call log tab, or the Contacts tab, you arrive at the same screen, which is 
shown in Figure 8-4. The only difference is whether a phone number has been 
filled out for you.
 
Figure 8-4: 
The contact 
editing 
screen.
 

126
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
Let’s take a look at the fields on this screen:
 
✓ Add icon: By touching Add icon, you can assign to your contact a pic-
ture that appears every time the contact calls. You’ll be taken to the 
G1’s picture viewer, and this is where it gets cool! When you select a 
picture from this screen, Android attempts to find and automatically 
highlight any faces that it finds in the picture, as in Figure 8-5 (don’t ask 
me how it knows — it’s a mystery).
 
Figure 8-5: 
Android 
attempts 
to find the 
faces in this 
picture — 
one out of 
two ain’t 
bad.
 
 
 If the picture viewer can detect faces, it places a box around each one 
that it finds; if it can’t find any faces, it puts a single highlight box in the 
middle of the picture. Either way, you touch the box you want to use to 
select it, and this serves as your crop box for the picture. Dragging your 
finger within the box moves it around the image. Dragging your finger 
on the box’s border changes the size of the box. The part of the picture 
within the box becomes the icon for this contact, so crop carefully! Once 
you’re satisfied with your work, touch Save (or touch Discard to cancel 
and return to the editing screen without making any changes to the con-
tact’s icon).
 
✓ First and Last box: This is where you enter your contact’s first and last 
name.
 
 
It’s important that you maintain a consistent first, last ordering here — 
you don’t want a mix of Joe Smiths and Smith Joes in your contacts list 
because they would end up being listed out of order and it would become 
difficult to find them by scrolling.
 
✓ Dial number fields: The area under the Dial number heading lists one or 
more phone numbers and number types.
 
 Number types can be common terms such as Home, Mobile, Work, 
and Fax, but you can also add your own. The default number type for a 
new number is Mobile. To change the default type, touch it and a menu 

127
 Chapter 8: Contacts
appears; touch a type name in the list to select it. To use your own 
type name, scroll to the bottom of the menu and touch Custom. A new 
window appears, prompting you to type a new name; touch OK when 
you’re finished.
 
 Once you’ve selected a number type, highlight the Phone number box 
and type the phone number.
 
✓ Send email fields: These fields look — and work — much the same 
way as the Dial number fields, except you’re entering an e-mail address 
instead of a phone number.
 
 The default e-mail address type is Home. To change the default, touch 
it and a menu appears. Just like your phone numbers, you can create 
custom types by scrolling to the bottom of this menu and touching 
Custom.
 
✓ Ringtone: By default, all contacts sound the same ringtone when they 
call — but where’s the fun in that? Selecting a custom ringtone for a con-
tact is an easy way to know when that special someone is calling with-
out even having to glance at your G1. Touch the box to the right of the 
Ringtone label to select a different ringtone; touching a ringtone name 
plays it so you can preview it, and touching OK assigns it.
 
✓ Send calls directly to voicemail: Speaking of “special someone,” we all 
have a few people in our lives who we’d rather not talk to from time to 
time. With Android, your phone can do the dirty work of sending the call 
straight to your voice mail box for you. When this option is selected and 
the contact calls, you’ll never even hear your phone ring (or vibrate, as 
the case may be). If you’re looking to send all your calls to voicemail, 
there’s a simple solution for that, too — turn off your phone!
 
✓ More info: You can add a lot of additional information to a contact 
besides a picture, a name, a phone number, and an e-mail address, and 
this is where you do it. Touching the More info icon displays a menu of 
various fields you can add to this contact.
 
 If you want to add additional phone numbers and e-mail addresses — 
say, one each for home and work — you can do that by touching the 
Phone or Email items, which open submenus of available phone number 
and e-mail types, respectively. As before, you can scroll down and touch 
Custom to enter your own.
 
 Additionally, you can add the contact’s various instant messaging (IM) 
accounts, street address, company, and job title (grouped under Other 
as the Organization option), as well as freehand notes.
After you’ve finished entering information for this new contact, touch Save at 
the bottom of the screen, or touch Discard changes to cancel.

128
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
Doing Stuff with Contacts
It turns out that contacts aren’t just for making phone calls anymore! Every 
type of information that you add to a contact — phone number, e-mail 
address, instant message name, and mailing address — provides a new 
opportunity to perform an action on that contact directly from each contact’s 
details screen.
To get to a contact’s details screen, just touch the contact’s row in the 
Contacts tab. Let’s look at an example in Figure 8-6.
 
Figure 8-6: 
A contact 
details 
screen filled 
with plenty 
of info.
 
Here, we see just a portion of the contact’s full information — but from this 
snippet alone, we can do lots of things. Each section, denoted with a gray 
header, indicates a type of activity. Below each header are the details that 
correspond to that activity.
The simplest activity is Dial number. Touching a number in this section dials 
the number. But the fun’s just beginning! When you add a phone number to 
a contact, that number also becomes available for the Send SMS/MMS activ-
ity, so choosing the same phone number in this section opens the Messaging 
application and fills out the To box with this number.

129
 Chapter 8: Contacts
What else can I do? If I entered an e-mail address, I can start composing a new 
e-mail addressed to this contact simply by touching the e-mail address itself. 
In this case, both the Email and Google mail (Gmail) applications can service 
my request to send a new e-mail, so I’m given the option of choosing which 
to use, as shown in Figure 8-7. If I always want to use one or the other, I can 
select the Use by default for this action check box.
 
Figure 8-7: 
What appli-
cation do 
you want 
to use for 
sending 
an e-mail 
to this 
contact?
 
But it doesn’t stop there. I also see that for the Send instant message activ-
ity, this contact is available on AIM as ryan. Touching this detail, therefore, 
would open the IM application so I could send an instant message via AIM to 
screen name ryan (more on instant messaging in Chapter 12).
A street address has also been entered, so it appears under the Map address 
activity. Touching the address opens the Maps application and pinpoints the 
address for me — a lifesaver if I’m unfamiliar with the neighborhood!
Editing and Deleting Contacts
You can edit a contact in two ways. If you’re currently in the Contacts tab — 
not looking at a specific contact’s details — do the following:
 
1. Locate the contact you want to edit in the list.
 
2. Touch and hold on the contact’s row until the pop-up menu appears.

130
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
3. To delete the contact, touch Delete contact. To edit the contact, touch 
Edit contact.
If, instead, you’re already looking at a contact’s details:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. To delete the contact, touch Delete contact. To edit the contact, touch 
Edit contact.
In either case, touching Delete contact displays a pop-up message asking for 
confirmation that you really want to get rid of the contact forever. From this 
message, you can always touch Cancel to back out.
If you’re editing the contact, you are brought to the same screen you worked 
with when you created the contact — familiar territory. When you’ve finished 
making changes, simply touch the Save icon at the bottom of the screen or 
push the Menu button and touch the Save item.
Contacts Settings Screen
The configurable settings for the Contacts tab are surprisingly simple — 
in fact, you have only two! To get to the Settings screen (see Figure 8-8), 
push the Menu button while looking at the Contacts tab and then touch the 
Settings menu item.
 
Figure 8-8: 
The Settings 
screen in 
the Contacts 
app.
 

131
 Chapter 8: Contacts
Let’s take a look at your options here:
 
✓ Sync groups: If you have stored in Google certain groups of contacts 
that you know you’ll never need on the phone, you can save storage 
space on your G1 and wireless data usage by limiting which groups are 
synchronized with Google.
 
 When you touch this item, a menu appears with a list of group names 
to synchronize. A check mark to the left of a group name means that it’s 
set to be synchronized. By default, all groups are synchronized, which 
is set by selecting the Sync all contacts item at the very top of the list. 
When this is selected, you cannot deselect individual groups — they’re 
all selected.
 
 To limit the groups that are synchronized, first touch Sync all contacts 
to remove the check mark, which automatically deselects every group 
in the list. Then, go through and touch the groups to which you want to 
add a check mark. You can always revert to the default option of syn-
chronizing all groups by touching Sync all contacts again.
 
✓ SIM contacts importer: As I mention in Chapter 4, the SIM card installed 
inside your G1 contains a little bit of usable memory for storing SMS 
messages and contacts. Back in the dark ages of cellphones — before 
Android, that is — you could copy a small number of contacts (each 
with a limited amount of information) between cellphones by moving 
the SIM from one phone to the next. With Android, this isn’t necessary 
because all your contacts are automatically stored with Google.
 
 If the SIM card in your G1 has been brought over from another phone, 
though, and has some contacts stored on it, you can see these entries 
in your contacts but you can’t call them or use the data associated with 
them until you import them. To perform the import, touch the SIM con-
tacts importer menu item, which brings up a list of all contacts on the 
SIM. Pressing on a contact in this list displays the New contact screen 
with as much information already filled in as possible. Add whatever 
additional information you’d like — just as though you were creating any 
other new contact — and then touch Save at the bottom of the screen to 
create a new contact on your G1. You can also import all contacts 
at once by pushing the Menu button and touching Import all, but 
beware — all the contacts on the SIM will be imported immediately, and 
you’ll have to go back to each imported contact’s details screen to edit 
any additional details.

Calendar
In This Chapter
▶ Working with the four Calendar views
▶ Creating a calendar event
▶ Changing and deleting events
▶ Configuring Calendar settings
I
f you’re still using an outdated PDA, pencil and paper, a few well-placed 
Post-It notes, or some scribbles on the back of your hand to keep track 
of your busy schedule, that strategy comes to a screeching halt today. Let’s 
be honest, you lead a crazy life — we all do — and you need all the help you 
can get keeping track of meetings, appointments, dinners with the family, and 
everything else that keeps you running from one part of town to the other 
day in and day out. Well, you may have noticed that Google does a fantastic 
job of managing your personal information and keeping it stored, safe, and 
secure. Your calendar is no exception.
Just like your contacts, your calendar is stored in the “cloud” — it’s automati-
cally synchronized to Google’s Internet-based services. The advantage of that 
seamless, automatic synchronization is threefold:
 
✓ You don’t need to use your G1 to see your calendar: Having your 
schedule on the go is a must, but for many of us, sitting at a desk in front 
of a computer monitor is a daily reality. Why would you want to use 
your G1 to check your schedule when your PC is right in front of you? 
With Android and Google, all you need to do is head over to calendar.
google.com to see your upcoming goings-on from the soft, warm glow 
of your desktop display.
 
✓ Backup is silent and automatic: I’m sure you treat your G1 with the care 
that you’d treat a child — but accidents happen. If your beloved phone 
breaks or goes missing, your schedule won’t be lost with it. (On the 
downside, you’ll no longer have a good excuse to miss that snoozefest of 
a status report meeting.)

134
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
✓ You can share calendars: One of the most interesting features of Google 
Calendar is its ability to support many separate calendars on the same 
display. For example, maybe you have Work, School, and Personal cal-
endars for yourself — but you also have a Rec League Softball calendar 
that you share with your team. With the G1, any changes you make to 
shared calendars will be seen by everyone who shares that calendar 
with you.
One Calendar, Four Ways
More than anything else, you’ll be using the Calendar application to glance at 
your schedule; of course you can make edits and create new events on-the-
fly, but job number one is to show you the goods. Just like Google Calendar 
on your desktop, Calendar on your G1 can slice and dice your schedule a 
variety of ways.
First, let’s open the Calendar. You do this the same way you open virtually 
any other application on the G1 — touch its icon in the Applications tab or its 
shortcut on the Home screen if you’ve created one.
 
From time to time, you might get an e-mail from Google that contains a link 
to view a calendar. This can happen, for example, if a contact of yours shares 
a new calendar with you. These e-mails were designed to be read from your 
desktop, though, and as of press time these links don’t work on your G1. If 
you click them, you’re taken to the Browser, where you see an error message 
saying that you’re using “a browser that isn’t currently supported” (see Fig-
ure 9-1). For the most part, this isn’t a problem — shared calendars are auto-
matically added to your account, so you’ll still be able to see any events on 
the calendar simply by going to the Calendar application as usual.
Once you’ve opened the Calendar application, you’ll see one of several 
views. (I get to these next.) If you already use Google Calendar on the Google 
account to which your G1 is associated, you see any events there listed 
here — they’re continuously synchronized. In other words, any changes you 
make from your desktop are visible here without any extra work on your 
part, and vice versa.
If you don’t use Google Calendar yet, you’ll see a clean slate — but don’t 
worry, we’ll fix that soon enough!
The very first thing you’ll want to be able to do is cycle between views. You 
can choose from four: Day, Week, Month, and Agenda. From any view in the 
Calendar, you can zip on over to a different view simply by pushing the Menu 
button and making a selection (see Figure 9-2); the selections appear as the 
first three menu items (and naturally, the view you’re currently in will not be 
an option).

Let’s take a look at how the view is laid out:
 
✓ Date header: The day of the week and date are always visible as a gray 
bar directly below the status bar, even if you’ve scrolled down to the 
end of the day.
 
✓ Timeline: Each hour from 12 a.m. to 11 p.m. appears on the timeline to 
the left of the display. An am or pm indicator is visible on the first hour 
at the very top, no matter what hour you’re looking at — that way, you 
always know whether you’re looking at morning or evening (a good 
thing; otherwise I’d be showing up for dinner dates at 7 in the morning).
 
✓ Events: Your events appear throughout the timeline as white boxes 
with the name of the event and the location (if you specified it) written 
within. If multiple events overlap, they’ll be narrower so they can all 
appear across the screen. All-day events, which are events that aren’t 
assigned explicit start and end times, appear as immovable white boxes 
near the top of the screen between the date header and the topmost 
hour marker.

137
 Chapter 9: Calendar
Touching an event gives you additional information about it in a box at the 
bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 9-4. For this Review Board meeting 
I have scheduled from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., for example, the box explicitly spells 
out the start and end time of the event (handy, since this can be unclear 
just by looking at the timeline for events that don’t start or end on the hour 
or half hour). Because I’ve set a reminder for this event, it also shows a bell 
icon. This extra detail box covers up part of your timeline, so it disappears 
after a moment to get out of your way.
 
Figure 9-4: 
Extra details 
for an event.
 
Event
Event details
Event reminder
To move between hours of the day, swipe up and down or move the trackball 
up and down; similarly, you can swipe or move the trackball left and right 
to change days one at a time. You can quickly return to the current date by 
pushing the Menu button and touching the Today menu item, which also 
automatically selects the current hour-long time block.
Week view
The Week view, shown in Figure 9-5, is similar to the Day view — in fact, you 
can think of it as a Day view compressed horizontally to show seven days 
across. Just like the Day view, you can swipe up and down to move all the 
way from 12 a.m. at the top to 11 p.m. at the very bottom, and you can swipe 
left and right to move between weeks.

138
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
Figure 9-5: 
The Week 
view.
 
One difference you’ll notice from the Day view is that there are no event 
details within the white boxes — they’re just not wide enough! You can still 
touch a box to select it, though, which will call up the event details box at the 
bottom of the screen.
Pushing the Menu button and touching Today returns you to the current 
week and, like the Day view, places the highlight on the current date and time 
block.
Month view
Understandably, the Month view (see Figure 9-6) is pretty high level. Let’s 
just say you’re not going to be able to figure out exactly what’s going on for a 
particular day from here, but then again, that’s not really the idea. The Month 
view is simply a way for you to get a quick picture of your availability way out 
into the future.
At the top of the screen is a gray bar that indicates the month and year 
you’re currently viewing. Each day within the month is composed of a block 
with a number — that day’s date — and a vertical white bar to the right. 
This bar represents the entire day from 12 a.m. at the top to 11:59 p.m. at 
the bottom, just like a miniaturized Day view. Busy times within the day are 
denoted with green blocks.
To quickly get to the current month, push the Menu button and touch Today.

139
 Chapter 9: Calendar
 
Figure 9-6: 
The Month 
view.
 
 
Even if you configure a particular event to show you as available instead of 
busy, you’ll still see it shown in green in the Month view. In other words, in the 
Month view, all events are shown in green.
From here, you can swipe up or down to move between months. If you’re 
looking at the current month, the block for today’s date is shown in gray 
instead of the usual white. Want to zoom in and figure out exactly what’s 
going on for a particular day? No problem — simply touching any date will 
take you to its Day view.
 
By touching and holding a day in the Month view, you’ll be presented with a 
pop-up menu. From here, you can quickly choose to see the Agenda or Day 
view or create an event to occur on that day.
Agenda view
The Agenda view, shown in Figure 9-7, is a little different than the other three 
views because it cuts out all the fat — no empty, uneventful times are shown. 
It gets straight down to business by showing you only the scheduled events 
around the current time. This view provides a detailed glance of the meetings 
you have coming up (and those that have recently passed) without scrolling 
through hours (or days) of dead space.

140
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
 
Figure 9-7: 
The Agenda 
view.
 
Each day is presented in chronological order as a gray bar with all events 
scheduled for that day immediately below it. One great thing about the 
Agenda view is that the events are shown with quite a bit of detail: You get 
the full name of the event, the start and end times, and the location. If you’ve 
set a reminder, you also see a bell icon, and to the right of the bell you see 
the number of minutes, hours, days, or weeks before the event time that the 
reminder alarm is set to trigger. (I discuss adding reminders to your events 
later in the “Creating Events” section.)
From the Agenda view, pushing the Menu button and choosing the Today 
menu item positions the header for today’s date at the very top of the screen, 
making it easy to see what’s coming up next by simply looking at the top and 
reading down.
Working with multiple calendars
As I mentioned, Google Calendar supports multiple calendars, which makes 
it a breeze to share events with others, separate your work from your per-
sonal life, manage different projects or teams, or employ pretty much any 
other sort of organizational technique you can dream up. If a contact of yours 
shares a calendar with you, you’ll automatically see it on your G1 by default, 
and you can also go to calendar.google.com from your PC to create new 
calendars of your own.
You may have noticed in the previous screen shots in this chapter that 
events have different colored vertical bars (or different shades of gray in this 
case, since the book is printed in black and white) to the left side of their 

141
 Chapter 9: Calendar
boxes. This is an indication of what calendar they belong to. From your G1, 
you can determine what color corresponds to what calendar, and choose 
which calendars you want to see. (Your view can get cluttered quickly if too 
many calendars’ worth of events are shown at the same time.) To do this:
 
1. From any view in the Calendar application, push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the More menu item.
 
 A new submenu appears with additional items not available on the first 
menu you saw.
 
3. Touch My calendars.
 
 You see a screen similar to Figure 9-8 that presents a list of all your cal-
endars (and calendars that are shared with you) that are currently syn-
chronized to your G1. 
 
4. To hide a calendar from view, simply touch it to deselect it.
 
Figure 9-8: 
Selecting 
calendars 
to display.
 
From the My calendars screen, you can also remove calendars altogether so 
that they are no longer synchronized to the G1, saving space on your device 
and reducing data traffic. Here’s how:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the Remove calendars menu item.
 
 In the window that appears, touch to place a check mark next to any 
calendar that you want to remove from your G1.
 
3. Touch OK.

142
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
Removed calendars still exist in your Google account, and you can view them 
by going to the Google Calendar Web site from your PC. You can add calen-
dars back for synchronization with your G1 by repeating the preceding steps, 
touching Add calendars instead of Remove calendars in Step 2.
Creating Events
From any view in the Calendar, you can push the Menu button and touch the 
New event item to get the ball rolling on the creation of a new event, but you 
can do it using a couple of other methods too:
 
✓ From the Day or Week view, highlighting an open time (either by touch-
ing it or rolling the trackball to it) and selecting it will create a new one-
hour long event starting at the time you selected. (You can adjust the 
time and duration from the New event screen.)
 
✓ From the Month view, hold down on a date until a pop-up menu appears 
and then choose New event to create a new event scheduled for the 
selected day.
Any way you initiate the creation of the new event, you’ll end up with a 
screen like Figure 9-9.
 
Figure 9-9: 
Creating a 
new event.
 
Let’s go over the available fields:
 
✓ What: This is the name of the event — for example, “Lunch” or “Shop for 
some cool For Dummies books.” At a minimum, you’ll want to fill this out 
so you know what the event is.
 
✓ From/To: You’ll see two boxes for both the From and To fields — one 
each for the date and time. Touch any box to modify it. You can use the 
+ and — icons on the screen to increment the month, date, year, hour, 

143
 Chapter 9: Calendar
and minute, but you can also touch the actual text in the center and type 
right over it as you would for any other text box. Use whatever method 
is easier for you. When you have each of the four boxes set to match 
the start and end times for this event, touch OK to accept your entry or 
Cancel to discard it.
 
✓ All day: If the event you’re scheduling runs all day, such as vacation, 
you can add a check mark here. When you do so, the times from the 
From/To fields above disappear, and you’ll be able to select only dates.
 
✓ Where: This is the location where the event is taking place. It is just for 
your reference and is not a required field.
 
✓ Description: You can add any notes about the event here, like “Wow, 
this is going to be a boring meeting! Glad I’ll have my G1 with me for 
entertainment.”
 
✓ Calendar: If you have multiple calendars, you can choose which calen-
dar this event is assigned to (for example, meetings might go to your 
Work calendar) by touching this field and selecting an option.
 
✓ Reminders: Before the start of an event, you can schedule one or more 
reminders to appear on your G1. By default, you’ll see one reminder 
here (unless you’ve changed the default — more on that when I talk 
about Settings later in the chapter). You can modify how long before the 
start of the event the reminder fires by touching the down arrow and 
choosing a duration from the menu.
 
 If you want to get rid of a reminder, just touch the red X icon next to 
it on the right side of the screen. To add a reminder, push the Menu 
button and touch Add reminder.
 
✓ Repeats: Most events you create will likely be one-time affairs, but occa-
sionally you’ll set up a meeting, an annual gathering, or something else 
that repeats on a regular basis. Fortunately, Android can handle these 
with aplomb. Touch the down arrow on the box and choose a repeat 
interval, and Android adds the appropriate events automatically.
If you push the Menu button and touch Show extra options, the New event 
screen adds two additional fields at the bottom of the list:
 
✓ Presence: This lets you select whether other people with free/busy 
access to your calendar see this event as available or busy time. The 
default option is Show as busy, but there may be times (such as a meet-
ing you don’t plan on attending, for example) when you want to add an 
event to your calendar while still showing yourself as being available to 
others who can see your free/busy status.
 
✓ Privacy: This option sets who can see details about this event. 
Calendars themselves have privacy settings, and the default option — 
appropriately named Default — just makes the event use its calendar’s 
settings. You can override that by choosing the Private or Public option.

144
Part II: Putting the “Google” in Google Android 
After you’ve finished entering all the information for this event, just touch 
Save to commit it to your calendar or touch Discard changes to cancel it.
Working with Events
You can touch any event in any view to be brought to the View event screen 
(see Figure 9-10), which lists everything there is to know about the event: 
name, time, location, name of the calendar on which it resides, and any 
reminders associated with it.
 
Figure 9-10: 
The view 
event 
screen.
 
 
From here you can add and remove reminders in the same way you do when 
you’re adding or editing an event. Push the Menu button and touch Add 
reminder to add a reminder, or touch the X next to the reminder to remove it.
Invitations
If this event was sent to you by another contact as an invitation, you see a 
field with the Attending? label. The default is (No response), but this can be 
changed to Yes, Maybe, or No to notify the sender of your intentions.
 
Unfortunately, you can’t currently use your G1 to invite others to attend 
events in your calender. To do that, you need to use the Google Calendar Web 
site from your PC.

145
 Chapter 9: Calendar
Editing and deleting events
To edit or delete an existing event:
 
1. Find the event you want to edit in the Day or Week view.
 
2. Touch and hold down on the event until a pop-up menu appears.
 
3. Touch Edit event or Delete event.
 
 Choosing Edit event returns you to the same screen you used when 
creating the event — from here, you can modify fields as necessary and 
then touch Save at the bottom of the screen. Touching Discard changes 
keeps the event but throws away any changes you’ve just made. Delete 
removes the event altogether.
 
You may not have permission to change some of the calendars you see on 
your screen that other people have shared with you. For events on these cal-
endars, you will be able to only view the event from the pop-up menu, not edit 
or delete it.
Calendar Settings Screen
To show the Settings screen for the Calendar app, push the Menu button 
from any view, touch the More menu item, and choose Settings. This will 
bring you to a display like the one in Figure 9-11.
Here’s what you can configure from the Calendar’s Settings screen:
 
✓ Hide declined events: If this is selected, events you are invited to that 
you indicate you will not be attending are not shown on your calendar.
 
✓ Set alerts & notifications: Touching this lets you choose from three 
styles of reminders: Alert, Status bar notification, and None. Alert is the 
most in-your-face option, covering your entire screen with a message 
detailing the event, as shown in Figure 9-12. Status bar notification is 
your typical notification — just like you’d get for text messages, e-mails, 
or other features — and None just quietly ignores your reminders.
 
✓ Select ringtone: This selects the sound to accompany reminders.
 
✓ Vibrate: If this check box is selected, your phone gives you a little jolt 
when your reminders go off.
 
✓ Set default reminder: This setting determines the default reminder 
duration used when you create a new event. If you choose Never, you 
need to add a reminder manually to each event you create for which you 
want a reminder.

In this part . . .
T
here’s a whole lot of Google stuffed into this phone, 
but the G1 is so much more than that. In Part III, 
you’re going to find out how to surf the Web, talk to 
friends through services such as AIM, customize settings, 
and bring out the G1’s lighter side with pictures, YouTube 
videos, and music.

Chapter 10
Browsing the Web
In This Chapter
▶ Navigating to and between Web sites
▶ Storing your favorite sites as bookmarks
▶ Scrolling and zooming
▶ Viewing multiple sites at the same time
▶ Downloading files over the Web
▶ Changing the orientation of the G1 screen
▶ Working with the Browser Settings screen
U
nless you’ve already cut your teeth on a device like the iPhone, odds 
are you’re not accustomed to being able to browse the World Wide 
Web — yes, the real one, not a watered-down one — right on your handset. 
Although virtually all cellphones sold today offer Web browsing capability in 
one capacity or another, few can effectively surf sites with a level of sophisti-
cation that nearly matches that of your PC. With these less-capable phones, 
sites you want to browse don’t load, don’t look right, or are presented as a 
mobile version that doesn’t offer all of the regular site’s functionality. Who 
wants that?
Fortunately, the G1’s Browser application (see Figure 10-1) is one of the best 
phone-based Web browsers the world has seen. It can do just about every-
thing your desktop browser can, and thanks to the G1’s support for Wi-Fi and 
3G data networks, it can do it all downright speedily. In this chapter, I get 
into everything the Browser has (and doesn’t have) to offer, explain the dif-
ferences between browsing on your G1 and browsing on your desktop, and 
show you some cool tricks along the way that’ll darned near make you forget 
your desktop’s browser ever existed!

150
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
Figure 10-1: 
The 
Browser.
 
Opening the Browser
If you want to choose a bookmark or browse directly to a particular Web 
address by typing its URL, you can do so simply by touching the Browser icon 
in the Applications tab (or on your Home screen, if you have an icon for it 
there). If you want to perform a Web search, though, you don’t even have to 
start the Browser first — you can enter your search from the Google search 
widget (if you have it on your Home screen) or by pushing the Menu button 
while at your Home screen and touching Search, as I mention in Chapter 5.
WebKit: The engine that makes it all happen
Although many Web browsers are available 
for PCs and mobile devices, only a handful of 
popular browsing engines power those brows-
ers. Each engine is a jumble of computer code 
that decides how to interpret HTML and other 
Internet languages and render it on the screen 
so that you can see it. Because each engine 
behaves slightly differently, Web site design-
ers need to make sure that their sites are fully 
compatible with all of the most popular engines; 
otherwise, they risk losing readers!
The four most popular engines in the world for 
Web browsers are Trident, Gecko, WebKit, and 
Presto. Trident is used by Microsoft Internet 
Explorer, Gecko is used by Firefox, and Presto 
is used by Opera. WebKit, however, is used by a 
variety of moderately popular browsers, includ-
ing Apple Safari and Google Chrome. 
WebKit is used also by a number of browsers 
designed for cellphones because it’s renowned 
for its compactness and speed, attributes that 
are especially important on phones, where 
memory consumption and processor power 
are at a premium. Mobile Safari (used by the 
Apple iPhone) and the S60 browser (used by 
Nokia’s smartphones) use WebKit, and it’s no 
coincidence that they’re both highly regarded 
as fast, stable, and powerful mobile brows-
ers. Android’s Browser application also uses 
WebKit, which is a good thing — anyone who’s 
used Mobile Safari on an iPhone can tell you 
that!

151
 Chapter 10: Browsing the Web
Additionally, you can touch (or select with the trackball) any Web address 
in another application (such as Gmail) to open the Browser and go straight 
to that address — no need to memorize the address or copy it and open the 
Browser the old-fashioned way.
Going to or Searching for a Web Address
Once you’re in the Browser application, the easiest way to go to a Web 
address is by simply starting to type it (you’ll need the keyboard open to do 
this). As long as you don’t currently have a text box selected in a Web page 
that allows you to type into it, the Browser will detect that you’re trying to 
enter an address and automatically call up an address bar to allow you to 
enter your URL.
As you type, the G1 will search your browsing history and look for addresses 
that match what you’re typing. If it finds any matches, they are displayed as 
a list below the text box (see Figure 10-2). If you see what you’re trying to 
browse to, simply touch it in the list (or select it with the trackball) and the 
Browser will browse to it, which saves you a precious few keystrokes.
 
Figure 10-2: 
The 
Browser’s 
address and 
search bar.
 
Address and search bar
Browsing history
 
As I mention in Chapter 5, the Browser’s even smarter than that, too! It turns 
out that the address bar is also a search bar — you can use it to type a Google 
search instead of a Web address.

152
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Once you’ve finished entering your address or search terms, simply press 
Enter on the keyboard or touch Go to send the Browser on its way. The gray 
bar directly below the status bar indicates the Web address of the site being 
opened and the name of the site (if available); a rotating circle to the right 
tells you that the Browser’s hard at work downloading data. The gray bar 
progressively changes to yellow until the site — all its textual and image 
content — has finished loading, at which point the bar fades back to gray.
You can type Web addresses and perform searches using another method 
if you currently have a text box on a Web page highlighted. (This method 
works even if you don’t have a text box highlighted, but it’s especially handy 
if you do.) The Browser doesn’t recognize that you’re trying to type a new 
address because the characters you type go into the Web page’s text box. To 
type a Web address this way:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch Go to URL.
 
 A box appears at the top of the screen where you can enter a Web 
address.
To enter a Google search, the technique is slightly different:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch Search.
 
 A Google search box appears at the top of the screen. This differs from 
the address box you’ve seen using other methods in that you can enter 
only searches.
Support (or the lack thereof) for Adobe Flash
As you zip around the Web on your desktop 
browser, you’ll notice that a good percentage 
of the sites you visit have animated or dynamic 
content — objects that move, glow, or change 
based on actions you perform. This content is 
often powered by a technology called Flash, 
made by Adobe.
Because Flash requires lots of horsepower to 
run smoothly and look good, mobile phones 
with Web browsers frequently don’t include 
it for fear that you’ll run out of memory or 
overextend your processor so that the entire 
phone becomes very slow to use. Nokia’s 
S60-powered devices usually include a special 
version of Flash called Flash Lite — but they’re 
the exception to the rule.
At the time of publication, Android doesn’t sup-
port Flash in the Browser application. However, 
Adobe is excited about making Flash avail-
able to as many devices as it possibly can, 
so I believe that it will eventually be available 
as a download. In the meantime, you may see 
some empty boxes around the Internet (and the 
occasional page you simply cannot use at all) 
because Flash support is required.

153
 Chapter 10: Browsing the Web
Navigating the Web
Just like the Web browser on your PC, Android’s Browser has commands 
that allow you to navigate back and forth through Web pages you’ve recently 
viewed.
Moving backward and forward
To move back to the page you were at immediately before the current page, 
simply push the Back button. Alternatively, you can do the following:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. On the menu that appears at the bottom of the screen, touch More.
 
3. Touch Back.
Believe it or not, there’s yet a third way to go to the previous page: Hold 
down the Menu key on the keyboard and press J. In other words, there’s no 
shortage of ways to retrace your steps!
If you’ve moved back to a previous page and you’d like to move forward 
again, there’s no Forward button you can push — but not to fret:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the More menu item.
 
3. Touch Forward.
Like Back, there’s a key combination that can be used as well — hold down 
Menu on the keyboard and press K (conveniently, this is adjacent to J, so the 
key combinations for Back and Forward are right next to each other). 
Selecting links
To follow a link on a page — that is, to navigate to a page represented by 
a link — simply touch the link. Alternatively, you can move the trackball 
around, which will cause a yellow box to appear on the screen (see Fig-
ure 10-3). As you move the trackball, the box will highlight any links it 
encounters. When the link you want to select is highlighted, press down on 
the trackball.

154
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
Figure 10-3: 
Highlighting 
a link in the

Refreshing the current page
Sometimes you’re looking at a page that is updated frequently — say, the 
score in that all-important Cubs-Cards game. To refresh the current page 
(that is, retrieve the latest version of the page from its source), do the 
following:
 
1. While looking at the Web page that you want to refresh in the 
Browser, push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the Refresh menu item.
History
Remember that great Mediterranean recipe site you found yesterday? If only 
there were an easy way to go back and find it. Oh, that’s right, there is! Just 
like your desktop browser, the Browser app on Android puts your browsing 
history just a few clicks (or, in this case, touches) away.
To get to your history:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the More menu item.
 
3. Touch History.
The Recently-visited pages screen is called up (see Figure 10-4), showing 
every page you’ve visited recently in chronological order, with the most 
recent at the top.
Each day is broken up as its own section, titled by a gray bar. At the top we 
see Today — assuming you’ve visited any pages today — and further down 
you see a gray bar for Yesterday, and so on.

155
 Chapter 10: Browsing the Web
 
Figure 10-4: 
The 
Recently-
visited 
pages 
screen, also 
known as 
History.
 
Touch an item in the list (or select it with the trackball), and the Browser 
will navigate to it. Touch and hold down an item here instead, and you see a 
pop-up menu of commands. You’ll find a surprising number of things you can 
do with these addresses. Let’s walk through your choices:
 
✓ Open: The first option simply directs the browser to navigate to this 
link. It’s the same as touching the item without calling up the menu.
 
✓ Open in new window: If you already have the Browser looking at a 
page that you’re not finished with, you can open this link in a new 
window — just like tabs on your desktop browser. I discuss multiple 
browsing windows in detail later in this chapter, in the “Working with 
Multiple Windows” section.
 
✓ Bookmark link: If you want to add this link to your bookmarks to make 
it easily accessible to you on a long-term basis, this option is the way to 
do it. I get into bookmarks in more depth in the next section.
 
✓ Share link: This option is a cool way to quickly and easily share a Web 
page with friends, family, or coworkers. By touching this selection, 
Gmail opens and creates a new e-mail with the selected Web address 
filled out for you in the e-mail’s body. All you need to do is fill out the To 
field and, optionally, the Subject field and anything else you’d like to say 
in the e-mail’s body.
 
✓ Copy link URL: This command copies the Web address of the selected 
item so that you can paste it somewhere else. The copied address can 
go anywhere in Android where you see a text field — a calendar entry, 
an e-mail, a contact’s details — the list goes on.
 
✓ Remove from history: If you want to remove just this one Web page 
from your browsing history, select this item. The remainder of your his-
tory will be preserved.
If you want to clear your entire browsing history, push the Menu button 
while you are viewing the Recently-visited pages screen and then touch the 
Clear history menu item.

156
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Bookmarks
If you’re familiar with virtually any browser on your PC, odds are you’re 
familiar with bookmarks (known as favorites in some browsers). The concept 
is simple and works the same on Android. Bookmarks are simply a collection 
of Web addresses that you browse frequently and want quick access to with-
out having to remember and type the address each and every time.
Adding a bookmark
Bookmarking a page that you’re currently looking at is a breeze:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the More menu item.
 
3. In the list that appears, scroll down (either with your finger or the 
trackball) until you find the Bookmark page item.
 
4. Select Bookmark page.
 
 A new window appears, titled Bookmark link (see Figure 10-5). The 
Name and Location fields are filled out for you with the name of the 
page you’re attempting to bookmark (if available) and its Web address, 
respectively, but you can modify these by selecting the field and typing. 
You might modify the Name, for example, to something more memorable 
or meaningful to you.
 
5. After the Name and Location fields are to your liking, touch OK to add 
the page to your bookmarks.
 
Figure 10-5: 
The 
Bookmark 
link window.
 
The bookmarks screen
So where did your newly created bookmark go? Bookmarks go to a dedicated 
Bookmarks screen, which can be accessed while looking at any Web page:

157
 Chapter 10: Browsing the Web
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the Bookmarks menu item.
 
 A screen similar to the Recently-visited pages screen appears (see 
Figure 10-6), except the Bookmarks screen shows only pages you have 
specifically bookmarked.
 
Figure 10-6: 
The 
Bookmarks 
screen.
 
The G1 comes with several bookmarks to popular Web sites such as 
Wikipedia, CNN, Amazon, and the Weather Channel, along with entries for 
Google and T-Mobile’s Downloads and My Account pages. (Of course, you 
can delete any of these.)
At the top of the Bookmarks screen is another way to add a bookmark. 
Touching the New bookmark item bookmarks the page you were just looking 
at before coming to the Bookmarks screen. (The Current page line below New 
bookmark reminds you of which page that was.) Alternatively, you can push 
the Menu button from this screen and touch Bookmark last-viewed page. 
In either case, you are presented with the Bookmark link window (refer to 
Figure 10-5), where you have the opportunity to edit how the name and Web 
address of your bookmark will appear in the Bookmarks screen.
Using, editing, and deleting bookmarks
To select a bookmark and navigate to it using the Browser, simply touch it 
or select it using the trackball. Alternatively, you can touch and hold on a 
bookmark, which calls up a pop-up menu; then touch Open or Open in new 
window.
The pop-up menu I just mentioned lists several other things you can do with 
your bookmarks besides open them:

158
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
✓ Edit bookmark: Selecting this option brings up the same window you 
see when adding a new bookmark, except the window is titled Edit book-
mark instead of Bookmark link. Here, you can adjust the name of the 
bookmark or the Web address to which it points. Touch OK to commit 
your changes or Cancel to discard them.
 
✓ Share link: This option works the same way as it does in the Recently-
viewed pages screen. Selecting Share link adds the bookmark to the 
body of a new e-mail and opens the e-mail for editing.
 
✓ Copy link URL: This item copies your bookmark’s Web address so you 
can paste it elsewhere in the G1.
 
✓ Delete bookmark: Select this option to delete the bookmark from your 
Bookmarks screen. You receive a confirmation window asking you to 
make sure you want to delete the bookmark; touch OK to go ahead with 
the deletion.
Scrolling and Zooming Web Pages
Although the Browser application is fantastic at showing the full content of 
a Web page exactly as you’d see it on your PC, there’s a problem with that: 
Web pages are big, and your G1’s screen is small! The good news is that 
Google has cooked up a number of creative ways to get around this limita-
tion, and once you become familiar with these tricks, you’ll be a pro at navi-
gating huge pages on that tiny (well, relatively tiny) display in no time.
Scrolling
To scroll around a Web page that’s too big to display on the G1’s screen 
(which will be many — if not most — of them), simply touch and hold your 
finger to the display and move it around. Think of it like placing a hockey 
puck on an ice rink and moving it around with your finger — the Web page 
moves in the same way.
By stopping your finger’s movement before lifting it off the screen, the Web 
page will remain where you left it. However, if you flick your finger across the 
screen — meaning your finger is still in motion at the time that it leaves the 
screen’s surface — the Web page continues to move for a while before it slows 
to a halt. Flicking, a convenient way of scrolling across Web pages quickly, is a 
surprisingly natural motion, and you’ll become used to it in no time.
This isn’t the only way to scroll, however; you can also use the trackball 
if you prefer. As you move the trackball around, the yellow highlight box I 
mentioned earlier in the chapter appears and highlights any links it comes 
across. At any time, you can press the trackball to follow a link.

159
 Chapter 10: Browsing the Web
Zooming
Sometimes, scrolling isn’t enough to help you get the big picture of what’s 
going on with a particular Web page — you need to see more, and you need 
to see it all at once. How do you make that happen? In this section I go 
through your options for zooming pages in and out.
You may have noticed that when you scrolled around the page with your 
finger, some icons appeared at the bottom of the screen (see Figure 10-7). 
These are the Browser’s zooming controls. All told, the Browser offers a 
whopping 14 levels of zoom for the pages you view, and you have access 
to all of those levels using these controls. (You can call up these controls 
without scrolling the screen by pushing Menu, touching More, and touching 
Zoom from the menu that appears.)
 
Figure 10-7: 
The 
Browser’s 
on-screen 
zooming 
controls.
 
Zoom in
Zoom out
Four-way arrow
To zoom in one level, simply touch the magnifying glass icon with the plus 
sign (the left icon). To zoom out one level, touch the icon to the right of 
that — the magnifying glass with the minus sign. Easy, right? At every level of 
zoom, your scrolling controls still work the same — just move your finger or 
the trackball to navigate.
 
Although it’s difficult (well, nearly impossible) to read normal-sized text at 
the outermost zoom level, this level of zoom is a good way to see very large 
images that you encounter on your adventures across the Internet.

160
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
The Browser’s zooming capabilities get cooler, though — way cooler! By 
touching the four-way arrow in the lower right of the screen, the Browser 
zooms all the way out and shows a magnifying box in the middle of the 
screen (see Figure 10-8). By touching this box and dragging it around the 
screen, you can specify what part of the page you want to get a closer look at; 
when you let go, you return to the previous zoom level. Think of the zoomed-
out view as a quick way to get a bird’s-eye view of the entire Web page to 
help you decide what part you want to see up close on your G1’s screen. See, 
browsing big Web sites on a small screen isn’t so hard, is it?
 
Figure 10-8: 
The 
Browser’s 
magnifying 
box. 
 
 
While viewing a Web page, simply press the trackball twice quickly — a 
double press — and you’ll get the same bird’s-eye view I previously described. 
The difference here is that you can use the trackball to control the magnifying 
box, which makes it way easier to position precisely if you’re having a hard 
time controlling the box with your finger.
Working with Multiple Windows
If you’re using a modern browser on your PC — Internet Explorer 7, Firefox, 
or Safari, for example — you’re probably acquainted with the concept of 
tabbed browsing. Put simply, tabbed browsing places each page in a separate 
tab across the top of the window.
Android has adapted the tabbed browsing concept from PCs to the Browser. 
In this case, you’re not working with tabs in the traditional sense of the 
word — the screen’s just not big enough to devote space to them — but you 
still get all the functionality that goes along with them. The Browser calls 
these loaded pages windows instead.

161
 Chapter 10: Browsing the Web
Opening a link in a new window
If you’re browsing a page and want to follow a link without navigating away 
from the current page, you can open the link in a new window. To do this:
 
1. Touch and hold on the link (or select it with the trackball and hold 
the trackball down).
 
 After a moment, you see a pop-up menu of commands you can perform 
with the link.
 
2. Touch Open in new window.
 
 Something amazing happens — the page you’re currently looking at 
zooms out and becomes a square in a grid. (This grid is a view of all 
the Browser windows you currently have open, which we take a look at 
next.) Then the new link you selected zooms into view. Magically, you’re 
looking at the new page, and the page that you just navigated from is 
still in the background so you can return to it at a moment’s notice.
Switching between multiple windows
Say that you’re finished looking at this new link you’ve opened in a new 
window, and you’re ready to return to the page you were looking at before. 
Let’s take a look at how to do this:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the Window menu item.
 
 You go to the Current windows screen (see Figure 10-9), which is your 
home base for managing all the windows that are currently open in the 
browser. Each window gets its own box in a grid; the box shows a small 
preview of the page along with the page’s title at the bottom. If you have 
more windows open than will fit on the screen, you can scroll the screen 
to see all available windows.
 
3. Touch the box representing the page you want to view, or highlight it 
with the trackball and push down.
 
 The page zooms into view, and the Current windows screen disappears. 
To return to the screen again, simply repeat these steps.

162
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
Figure 10-9: 
The Current 
windows 
screen.
 
Opening a new blank window
If you want to keep your current Web page open and use a new window for 
viewing a Web address or Google search, that’s easy, too:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the Window menu item.
 
3. Touch the box that shows a page with a plus sign on it and a New 
window label at its bottom, or select it with the trackball and push 
down.
 
 A new, fresh window appears and loads your home page. From here, 
you can navigate to a Web address or enter a search term as you 
would normally.
While in the Current windows screen, another way to open a new Browser 
window is to push the Menu button and touch the New window menu item.
Closing windows
When you’re finished using a window, it’s a good idea to close it. Doing so 
not only unclutters your Current windows screen but also keeps memory 
usage to a minimum. (The G1 is a powerful phone, but memory is always at a 
premium!)
To close a window, return to the Current windows screen and touch the X 
icon in the lower-right corner of the box representing the page you want to 
close. You are prompted to confirm that you want to go ahead with the clo-
sure (see Figure 10-10). Touch OK to go ahead or Cancel to keep the window 
open.

163
 Chapter 10: Browsing the Web
 
Figure 10-10: 
Closing a 
Browser 
window.
 
Saving Files from the Browser
The problem with the Web is that it’s transient — what’s here today might 
be gone tomorrow. You’d probably like to hang on to lots of stuff out there 
on the Web, and the Browser makes that possible for common things such as 
pictures and sounds.
Pictures
On occasion, you may encounter a picture on the Internet that you’d like to 
save to your G1’s memory to use as wallpaper or an icon for a contact or to 
send in an e-mail. With the Browser, it’s no sweat:
 
1. While looking at the page in the Browser containing the image you 
want to save, scroll to the image so that it is in view.
 
2. Touch and hold on the image.
 
 You see a pop-up menu of commands.
 
3. Scroll down in the menu and touch the Save image item.
 
 A Download history screen appears, as shown in Figure 10-11, displaying 
everything you’ve downloaded or are currently downloading.
What’s neat is that you don’t need to remain on this screen while you wait for 
your download to complete — you can push the Back button to return to the 
Browser (or go to any other application on your phone) and the download 
will continue in the background. An icon depicting an animated down arrow 
appears in the status bar while the download is in progress; when it’s com-
plete, the arrow stops animating.

164
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
Figure 10-11: 
The 
Download 
history 
screen.
 
By pulling down the Notifications screen and selecting a completed down-
load (see Figure 10-12), you’ll be taken straight to the necessary program for 
viewing or playing the type of file you downloaded, which in this case is the 
Picture Viewer for viewing the image you just downloaded.
 
Figure 10-12: 
You’re noti-
fied when 
your down-
load has 
finished.
 
Music, Web pages, and everything else
As I alluded to in the preceding section, your downloads aren’t limited to 
pictures. You can download music files such as MP3s and WAVs, and you can 
even download Web pages to HTML files on your G1 and view them later. If 
you want to download something other than an image, you access it via a link 
instead of an image, but the process is essentially the same.

165
 Chapter 10: Browsing the Web
Say you want to download a music file that is accessed from a link on a Web 
page and then save the file to your G1 so you can listen to it later. Here’s 
what you do:
 
1. In the Browser, locate the link to the music file on the page.
 
2. Touch and hold on the link.
 
 After a moment, you get a pop-up menu.
 
3. Scroll down in the list and select Save link.
 
 As before, you’re taken to the Download history screen, where the 
status of your download (among any other downloads you may have in 
process) is shown.
If you had chosen the Save link menu item for a link that goes to a Web page 
instead of a music file, the page’s HTML would be downloaded for you to 
view. 
If you attempt to download a file type that isn’t supported by Android (such 
as a Windows program or a PDF), the Download history screen and the 
Notifications screen both let you know with a message (see Figure 10-13). 
You don’t have to perform any other action — the G1 is smart enough to 
not download the file, and no space is taken up in your phone’s precious 
memory.
 
Figure 10-13: 
Oops! This 
file type

Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Working with the Download history screen
The Download history screen, which works a lot like your Recently-viewed 
pages screen, shows you what you’ve downloaded (instead of what you’ve 
viewed) and can be cleared.
First, we need to open the Download history screen. You don’t need to start a 
download to get to it; you can view the screen through the Browser’s menu:
 
1. While looking at a Web page in the Browser, push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch the More menu item.
 
3. In the menu list that appears, scroll down and select Downloads.
To clear your entire download history from the Download history screen:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch Clear list.
 
 
You are warned that all items in the list will be cleared and also removed 
from the Browser’s cache, meaning that you won’t be able to open 
downloaded items from here anymore. And unless the items have been 
saved to another program such as Pictures or Music, they’ll be gone, 
period. This action affects downloaded Web pages and APK (Android 
package) files, which are applications you can install.
 
3. Touch OK to continue clearing the list or Cancel to abort the opera-
tion and leave the list intact.
You can also work with individual items in the Download history screen. 
Touching and holding on any item in the list calls up a pop-up menu of opera-
tions that you can perform. You see different options depending on the item.
If an item that you select is still in the process of downloading, touching 
Cancel download stops it in its tracks. If the item has already finished down-
loading, you see two options:
 
✓ Open: This option simply opens the item. The way the item is opened 
depends on the type of item. For example, Picture Viewer opens an 
image and Music opens a sound clip.
 
✓ Clear from list: If you just want to remove a single item from your down-
load history without clearing the entire list, this is the option to use. 
Selecting this menu item immediately clears the selected item without 
prompting you to confirm, so make sure you mean it!

167
 Chapter 10: Browsing the Web
Changing the Screen Orientation
Opening the keyboard automatically flips the screen from a portrait to a 
landscape orientation for you. But because most Web pages are designed to 
be read on a screen that’s wider than it is tall, there may be times when you 
want to put the G1’s screen in a landscape orientation even when the key-
board is closed. To do this:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch More.
 
3. Scroll down in the menu that appears and select Flip orientation.
To change back to portrait orientation, simply repeat these three steps. 
Note that the Flip orientation menu item is grayed out — that is, it’s not 
selectable — when the keyboard is open. And really, wouldn’t it be a little 
weird to use the keyboard when the screen’s facing the wrong way, anyway?
Browser Settings Screen
With so many similarities between Android’s Browser and your desktop 
equivalent, you might suspect that similarities exist in their settings, too — 
and you’d be right. Let’s take a close look at everything that’s available in 
this screen. First, let’s open the Settings screen. Unlike some other applica-
tions that make their Settings screen accessible from the first menu that 
appears when you push Menu, the Browser buries its Settings screen just a 
little deeper:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Touch More.
 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the menu that appears and select Settings.
 
 The Settings screen appears, as shown in Figure 10-14.
So what sort of settings, gadgets, and doohickeys does Android make avail-
able to us? What can we tweak? Here’s what we have:
 
✓ Text size: This option adjusts the default text size for all Web pages. 
A smaller size means more text can fit on the screen, but the tradeoff, 
of course, is that the text becomes less readable. Touching this item 
will bring up a menu of available sizes; simply touch the size you want 
to use.

168
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
Figure 10-14: 
The 
Browser’s 
Settings 
screen.
 
 
✓ Block pop-up windows: Like desktop browsers, the Android Browser 
has built-in protection to prevent the display of many pop-up windows 
(frequently, these are used for advertising and can be annoying, to say 
the least). By default, pop-up blocking is enabled, but you can disable 
it by touching the check box to deselect it. If you decide to disable this 
item, pop-up windows appear as new windows in the Browser.
 
✓ Load images: By default, images on Web pages are loaded. (They’re 
the best part, after all!) There may be times, however, when you are on 
a slow data connection or are trying to conserve how much data you 
receive, especially if you’re roaming on another carrier’s network and 
are being billed by the kilobyte. Deselecting this box will cause only text 
to be loaded.
 
✓ Auto-fit pages: When this option is selected, the Browser tries to change 
the layout of loaded Web pages to better fit on your screen. Depending 
on what you’re trying to view, this option can make pages difficult or 
impossible to read, so if you’re having problems, try deselecting this 
option.
 
✓ Enable JavaScript: Many Web sites use the JavaScript programming 
language to do cool things that wouldn’t be possible with HTML alone. 
Enabling JavaScript (the default option) makes the Browser run slightly 
slower, but because so many modern sites rely on JavaScript to look and 
work correctly, there’s little reason to disable it.
 
✓ Open in background: If this option is selected, links that you open in 
new windows open “silently” — that is, the new window you’ve opened 
won’t be immediately shown to you. You’ll continue to see the same 
page from which you opened the link, and you’ll have to go to the 

169
 Chapter 10: Browsing the Web
Current windows screen to open the new one. Choosing this option is 
a matter of personal taste. Some people prefer to browse and navigate 
this way, while others hate it. (You say to-MAY-to, I say to-MAH-to.)
 
✓ Set home page: Touching this item brings up a window that allows you 
to type a Web address to a site that is shown automatically whenever 
a new Browser window is shown. The default option, Google’s mobile 
page, is a good one, but feel free to change it!
 
✓ Clear cache: To help reduce the amount of time it takes to access Web 
pages that you’ve been to before, the Browser automatically caches 
some items such as images and HTML, meaning it saves them into 
memory. That way, the next time they’re needed, the Browser can load 
them straight from memory instead of requesting and downloading them 
again. The size and contents of the cache are managed automatically, 
but you can manually clear the cache by selecting this option and touch-
ing OK in the confirmation window that appears.
 
✓ Clear history: Instead of clearing your history of viewed pages from the 
Recently-viewed pages screen that we looked at earlier in the chapter, 
you can do it right from here by selecting this item.
 
✓ Accept cookies: To help identify who you are, Web sites frequently use 
cookies, which are tiny nuggets of data stored in your Web browser. 
These are actually handy and common; for example, if you log in to a 
site with which you have an account and want it to remember your login 
information, the site will do this using a cookie. If you want to block 
cookies from being placed in the Browser, you can deselect this box, but 
keep in mind that some sites might not function properly.
 
✓ Clear all cookie data: Selecting this menu item and touching OK in the 
confirmation window that appears removes all cookies that are cur-
rently stored by the Browser. Keep in mind that any Web sites you’ve 
logged into will lose your login information, and you’ll have to log in 
again.
 
✓ Remember form data: As you type into text boxes on Web pages, this 
option will remember what you’ve typed and offer it as a suggestion the 
next time you encounter the same text boxes in the future. This feature 
is a nice little time-saver that cuts a few keystrokes out of your day.
 
✓ Clear form data: If you want to reset the suggestions that the Browser 
has accumulated for text boxes that you’ve filled out on Web pages, 
select this item and touch OK to confirm.
 
✓ Remember passwords: This option is essentially the same as Remember 
form data, but the Browser treats username and password information 
for logins to Web sites separately (and rightfully so — it’s a security 
concern). If your G1 might be shared with people whom you’d rather 
not have access to the sites you’ve logged into — your bank account, for 
example — deselect this box.

170
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
✓ Clear passwords: This option clears any usernames and passwords that 
the Browser has remembered for sites. If you intend to lend your phone 
to someone for any length of time, you can select this to make sure the 
person won’t be able to log in to any of your secure accounts (even if 
Remember passwords is selected).
 
✓ Show security warnings: Web sites that encrypt your information to 
ensure the security of your data (credit card and login information, for 
example) must comply with certain rules to make sure that the data is 
truly safe as it travels across the Internet. When this option is selected, 
the Browser can warn you if it detects any problems with compliance 
with these rules on a particular site.
 
✓ Enable Gears: Google Gears is a technology developed by (who else?) 
Google that allows both Google and non-Google Web sites to do some 
cool stuff such as store information offline so that it can be accessed 
without even connecting to the Internet. Not many sites use Gears, but 
several important ones do, such as Google Reader and Google Docs. 
I recommend leaving this option selected unless you have a specific 
reason to disable it.
 
✓ Gears settings: Selecting this item brings up a window showing you what 
Web sites you’ve accessed that have attempted to use Google Gears. 
You can specifically prevent certain sites from accessing Gears here 
if you so choose; you might block a site, for example, because certain 
Gears features allows sites to determine your physical location.
 
✓ Reset to default: If you want to give the Browser that new-browser 
smell, this is the way to make it happen. Selecting this and touching OK 
resets all settings in this screen to their factory-new default.
There are a lot of settings in this screen — more than you’ll find in most G1 
applications. Of course, you don’t need to change them all this second, but 
you might want to dog-ear this part of the chapter in case you’d like to revisit 
the settings in the future. 

Chapter 11
Working with and Taking Pictures
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a picture with your G1’s camera
▶ Setting snapshots as your wallpaper and contact images
▶ Browsing through picture albums
▶ Sharing pictures with your contacts
▶ Viewing slideshows of your pictures
▶ Cropping and rotating pictures
F
or a phone, the G1 has an amazingly large, high-resolution display (3.2 
inches diagonally and 480 x 320 pixels, for the record) that’s capable of 
displaying bright, vibrant color. It’d be a shame to let that kind of equipment 
go to waste, wouldn’t it?
Well, luckily, you don’t have to. Android includes a fairly powerful picture 
viewing application, aptly named Pictures, which you can use to organize and 
display the images that are important to you. In fact, you can even perform 
some basic editing tasks — all without transferring your pictures to a PC.
What’s more, the G1 has a 3.2-megapixel autofocus camera that you can 
use to take some decent shots when you don’t have the good ol’ point-and-
shoot handy. Don’t get me wrong: The G1 camera is not about to put your 
regular-duty camera out of a job, but it’ll get you by in a pinch — and it’s 
great for taking candid shots.
The G1 uses the Pictures application to view and manage pictures and the 
Camera application to take new ones. In this chapter, you look at the 
capabilities of both applications from the ground up. And what better place 
to start than with using the built-in camera? You’ll be an Android shutterbug 
in no time — say cheese!

172
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
The G1’s Camera
Until recently, the kind of photographic power seen in the G1 was unheard 
of for a cameraphone — and even now, the G1’s camera still toward the 
upper end of the spectrum. The 3.2-megapixel sensor means that the phone 
can take shots at 2048 x 1536 resolution, and as small as the lens is, it has a 
mechanical autofocus mechanism — not unlike what you’re used to in your 
regular camera — that allows the camera to take sharp photos at all but the 
closest distances.
Simply taking a picture is a snap (pun most definitely intended). You can 
open the Camera application in one of two ways: the traditional way, 
which is to open it as you would any other application in the Home screen’s 
Applications tab, or the nifty way, which is to simply hold down the G1’s 
Camera button, which is on the side of the phone to the right of the End 
button (or above the End button if you’re holding the G1 in a landscape 
orientation) until the application opens.
Taking a picture
Once the Camera application is open, you’ll immediately see what the camera 
lens is seeing on your screen; in fact, the entire screen is your viewfinder. To 
take a picture:
 
1. Hold the phone the same way you would a regular camera, with your 
finger positioned over (but not pressing) the Camera button.
 
2. When you’ve framed your shot the way you want it, push and hold the 
Camera button halfway down.
 
 You should feel some resistance at the halfway point — stop there. This 
is the camera’s cue to focus the image. After the camera has finished 
focusing, you’ll see a solid green circle in the corner of the screen (see 
Figure 11-1). Unless your phone is in Silent mode, you’ll also hear two 
quick beeps.
 
 If the green circle flashes instead of remaining solid (and if no beep is 
heard when the phone is not in Silent mode), the camera wasn’t able to 
properly focus, so be warned — your picture may not come out sharp. 
This can happen when you’re trying to take a picture of a very dark or 
low-contrast scene.
 
3. Push the camera button completely down.
 
 If your phone is not in Silent mode, you hear a shutter sound as the 
picture is taken.

The camera is focused
Congratulations! You’ve just snapped a shot. You’re not finished, though. The 
G1 needs to know what you want to do with the picture you just took. 
Immediately after you take the picture, you’re presented with four options 
along the bottom of the screen:
 
✓ Save: The first option saves the image to your phone’s memory and 
immediately returns you to the Camera’s viewfinder mode so you can 
take another picture.
 
✓ Set as: If you know just the person in your contacts list that this picture 
should be assigned to, use this option. You have three options that 
appear if you touch Set as:
 
• Contact icon: Assigns this newly taken picture as the icon for a 
contact in your contacts list.
 
• myFaves icon: Assigns this picture to one of your myFaves contacts.
 
• Wallpaper: Uses this picture as your Home screen wallpaper.
 
 Regardless of which option you choose, you are taken to a screen where 
you can crop (trim) the image. The cropping process works in the same 
way as discussed in Chapter 8 for assigning icons to contacts. Your 
image appears on the screen with an outlined region within it; only the 
part of the image within the outline is used. Drag your finger inside the 
outline to move it, and drag your finger on the outline itself to resize it.
 
 The shape of the outline varies depending on the type of crop that is 
needed (for example, myFaves icons require a circular image!), but the 
feature works in the same way.
 
 Once you’re satisfied with the shape and size of the crop, touch Save 
to commit it. If you’re not happy with the crop, touch Discard to throw 
it away.

Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
✓ Share: This option lets you immediately send the picture to others using 
one of several methods:
 
• Email: This option attaches your photo to a new e-mail in the G1’s 
regular, non-Gmail Email application. If you are using Gmail as your 
sole method of sending and receiving e-mail on the G1, use the 
next option, Google mail, which will open the Gmail application.
 
• Google mail: This functions the same as the Email option, but 
instead of using the Email application, Gmail is used. As before, your 
newly snapped photo is added to a new e-mail as an attachment.
 
• Messaging: This option allows you to send your picture as an MMS 
message. The Messaging application opens and your image is 
attached.
 
 Because the images that the G1 takes exceed the size limit for a 
multimedia message, the Messaging application offers to automati-
cally resize the image for you so you can send it (see Figure 11-2). 
If you choose Cancel, the image is not attached.
 
✓ Delete: Let’s face it, we’ve all taken a few less-than-stellar shots in our 
lives, and this option gives you an easy way to spike the bad ones as 
quickly as possible. The Delete option immediately deletes the picture 
you just took (without asking for a confirmation) and returns you to the 
viewfinder mode — to try again!

Camera Settings screen
The Camera application’s Settings screen can be accessed by pushing the 
Menu button and touching the Settings item. There are just a couple of 
options here:

175
 Chapter 11: Working with and Taking Pictures
 
✓ Store location in pictures: Touching this check box to select it enables a 
feature called geotagging, which places data about your current location 
(if your phone can determine it at the time) inside each image file. Many 
PC programs and Web services (including Google’s own Picasa photo 
management service) can read this data, so you can see exactly where 
you where when you took a the picture. Kind of cool!
 
✓ Prompt after capture: Enabled by default, after each picture is taken 
this option shows the Save, Set as, Share, and Delete items described in 
the preceding section. Deselecting this check box just saves each pic-
ture that you take to memory and returns you to the viewfinder to take 
another picture.
The Pictures Application
Besides the camera, the other piece of the G1’s photographic puzzle is its 
picture viewing capabilities. In this section I take you through everything that 
the Pictures application can do. Let’s start by opening it. Select its icon in the 
Applications tab, which looks like three Polaroid pictures (naturally!).
 
If you happen to be in the Camera and you want to hop over to the Pictures 
application, there’s a shortcut — simply push the Menu button and touch the 
Pictures menu item.
Browsing your pictures
The first thing you’ll see when you open Pictures is a thumbnail view of all 
the pictures on your G1, grouped by album (see Figure 11-3). Each album 
contains a grid of up to four images. Touching an album (or selecting it 
with the trackball) takes you to a view of its individual picture thumbnails 
(see Figure 11-4).
 
Android automatically uses a few standard picture albums that you should be 
aware of — you’ll see them frequently. The Camera album holds any pictures 
that were taken by your G1’s camera. When you’re looking at the directory 
view, you’ll notice that this directory gets a special icon — a camera icon — 
in the lower-right corner of its box. The download album contains any images 
you’ve downloaded from the Internet using the Browser application. The 
sdcard album contains images copied to the root directory of your G1’s 
memory card from your PC. (I cover connecting your phone to your PC in 
detail in Chapter 17.)

By touching and holding on a particular album, you are presented with two 
options:
 
✓ Slideshow: Displays all the images in this album as a full-screen 
slideshow.
 
✓ View: Views a directory of image thumbnails within the album. This 
option performs the same function as simply touching an album.

177
 Chapter 11: Working with and Taking Pictures
Viewing and working with 
individual pictures
Once you’re looking at an image thumbnail view within an album, touching a 
thumbnail will call up that image as a full-screen view. From here, touching 
the image will bring up zooming and navigation controls (see Figure 11-5). 
Similar to zooming in the Browser, touching the plus and minus magnifying 
glass icons will zoom the image in and out. You can touch and hold on either 
icon to zoom smoothly and continuously; simply let go to stop zooming.
Figure 11-5:

Zoom out
When you’re zoomed in so that you see only a portion of the full image, you 
can scroll around the image just as you would a Web page in the Browser: 
touch and hold on the image and drag your finger around. Touch the left and 
right arrows on either side of the image to navigate to the previous and next 
image in the current album, respectively.
By pushing the Menu button while looking at an image, you’re presented with 
a number of options:
 
✓ Slideshow: The first option starts a slideshow of the current album, 
starting with the current image as the first slide in the show.

178
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
✓ Share: This option functions the same as the Share option in the Camera 
application, allowing you to attach the current image to a new e-mail (in 
either the Email or Gmail application) or to a new MMS message. Note 
that when sending an MMS, you may be asked to allow the Messaging 
application to resize a shared image to make it small enough to send.
 
✓ Rotate: Touching this item brings up another menu, allowing you to 
rotate the image to the left (counterclockwise) or right (clockwise).
 
 When you use the Rotate command, you’re actually editing the image — 
any rotation you apply is immediately saved.
 
✓ Flip orientation: When the keyboard is closed, this item allows you to 
view the image in a landscape orientation instead of the default portrait 
orientation.
 
✓ Delete: This option deletes the image from memory. A confirmation 
window appears. Touch OK to go through with the deletion or Cancel to 
back out.
By touching More, you are presented with several additional options:
 
✓ Crop: This option calls up the cropping screen (see Figure 11-6), which 
you may be familiar with from the Set as or Contacts icon command. 
Like those other screens, you can move the cropping box around by 
touching and dragging within it. But the difference here is that you’re 
not restricted to a particular shape of box. By dragging on the top or 
bottom borders of the box, you adjust its height; and by dragging the 
left or right, you adjust its width. Once you’re satisfied with the crop, 
touch Save. Any part of the image outside the box is discarded and the 
part inside the box is saved. To cancel the crop, touch Discard.
Figure 11-6:
The crop-
ping screen.
 

179
 Chapter 11: Working with and Taking Pictures
 
✓ Set as: This item works the same as the Set as menu item in the Camera 
application, allowing you to use the current picture as a contact icon, 
myFaves icon, or your Home screen wallpaper. You’ll be asked to crop 
the image to the correct size before the operation is complete.
 
✓ Details: Selecting this option calls up a window that provides details 
about the current image — its file name, size, and pixel resolution.
With the exception of Flip orientation, all of these commands are available 
also by touching and holding on an image thumbnail and using the pop-up 
menu.
Picture Settings screen
You can access the Pictures application’s Settings screen from pretty much 
anywhere in the application — just push the Menu button and touch the 
Settings menu item (note that you’ll need to first touch More before you’re 
able to select Settings if you’re currently looking at an individual image when 
you push Menu).
Let’s have a look at the configurable options that are available here:
 
✓ Picture size: This option determines the size of the image thumbnails 
you see when you’re looking at the screen of all images contained in an 
album. You have two choices: Large and Small. Unless you’re dealing 
with a lot of images on your G1, I recommend using the Large setting 
because Small is quite small!
 
✓ Picture sort: This option lets you change the order in which images 
appear within an album — Newest first (that is, at the top left of the 
screen) or Newest last (that is, at the bottom right).
 
✓ Confirm deletions: If you deselect this option by touching the check box 
to remove the check mark, you will not be asked for confirmation when 
you delete an image. Doing so can be dangerous if you’re not careful, but 
if you have a lot of images to delete, disabling this option can save you a 
bit of time.
 
✓ Slideshow interval: When viewing a slideshow of images, The Slideshow 
interval option determines the amount of time each image is shown. You 
can choose between 2, 3, and 4 seconds.
 
✓ Slideshow transition: If you’re familiar with PowerPoint or another 
presentation application, you’ll know what this option is all about! This 
menu option chooses the animated effect that occurs between each 
image in your slideshow. The default effect is Fade in & out, but you 
can also choose a left-right slide or an up-down slide, or you can throw 
caution to the wind and let the G1 decide for you by choosing Random 
selection.

180
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
✓ Repeat slideshow: If you select this check box, slideshows loop continu-
ously instead of stopping after they’ve shown all images within the 
album.
 
✓ Shuffle slides: By default, images in the slideshow are shown in chrono-
logical order, just as they appear in the thumbnail view. By selecting this 
check box, you can change the behavior so that the slideshow shows 
images in a random order.
All told, Android’s built-in picture management is pretty basic; it’s just 
enough to get you started. The great news is that you’ll be able to get some 
awesome add-on applications for your phone that will let you adjust tint and 
contrast, add captions, and perform all sorts of cool effects. (Hang tight; I 
explain how to download those apps in Chapter 18!)

Chapter 12
Instant Messaging
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up different instant messaging services
▶ Editing and removing accounts
▶ Adding, removing, and blocking contacts
▶ Chatting with friends, family, and coworkers
▶ Working with the different Settings screens
You may have gathered by now that Android is talented at keeping you 
connected. Of course, you have a phone in there — but on top of 
that, you have all your e-mail accounts and top-notch support for text and 
multimedia messaging. For staying on the grid, Android is the total package 
(which could be a good thing or a terrible thing, depending on whether 
you’re trying to get away from work at the moment).
Depending on your T-Mobile plan, you may not have access to unlimited 
SMS and MMS messages, and if you go over your monthly allotment, you can 
end up with an expensive bill. Fortunately, the G1 has still other options to 
keep you in the loop without eating up your text and multimedia messaging 
allowance. Out of the box, with its built-in software, the G1 supports four 
major instant messaging (IM) services: AOL Instant Messenger (better known 
as AIM), Google Talk, Windows Live Messenger, and Yahoo! Messenger. 
These four are the biggest, most popular instant messaging services avail-
able, so the odds are good that you’ll be able to chat with most of your 
PC-based friends — those using an IM service, anyway — from your phone. 
And with the G1’s great keyboard, you’ll be able to respond quickly. Heck, 
they may never even know that you’re not in front of your computer unless 
you decide to spill your secret.
In this chapter, you see how to manage one, two, three, or all four of these 
services on your G1. You’ll be juggling multiple IM conversations and 
managing contacts with aplomb in no time.

182
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Selecting an Account
First, start up the IM application, which you’ll find in the Applications tab.
 
If you’re addicted to instant messaging your friends and family at all hours 
of the day and night — as so many of us are — you may want to create a 
shortcut to the IM from your Home screen. You could be accessing it a lot!
The first thing you’ll see when you start the IM application is the Chat — 
Select an account screen, which I’ll be referring to as the account selection 
screen throughout the chapter (see Figure 12-1). You can use this screen to 
sign in and out of individual services, check your status at a glance (more on 
that in a bit), and jump into your contact lists for each service.
Let’s take a closer look at what we’re seeing here. Each of the four services is 
represented by a row. The icon on the left of each row does more than just 
look pretty and show you the service’s logo. If you look closely, you’ll notice 
a smaller icon to the upper right of the larger one. This smaller icon indicates 
your status on that particular service (available, busy, away, and so on). 
These icons match their PC-based counterparts. For example, Google Talk 
uses a green dot to indicate that you’re available to chat, but Yahoo! 
Messenger uses a smiley face, so you see both styles here on their respective 
services. If you’re not signed in to a service, you see no smaller icon.

 Chapter 12: Instant Messaging
To the right of the icon, the service name is displayed along with your 
account name immediately below it. If you haven’t set up an account for a 
particular service yet, the area where your account name appears is blank. 
(And rest easy — we’ll be rectifying that situation in the next section, 
where I walk you through setting up accounts.) On the far right, if you have 
any IM conversations in progress, you see an indicator (such as “2 chats”). 
(When you get up to 8 or 10 chats, you can wave your G1 around and win any 
popularity contest that comes along.)
Setting Up Accounts
In the case of Google Talk, your account is already set up for you; it’s part of 
your Google account, which your G1 has known since you went through the 
initial setup process. Setting up AIM, Windows Live Messenger, and Yahoo! 
Messenger accounts is a snap, though.
 
If you don’t have an AIM account but do have an AOL e-mail address, I have 
good news: You actually do have an AIM account after all. Just use your AOL 
e-mail address for your username and your e-mail account’s password when 
setting up your AIM account in the following steps. Similarly, if you have a 
Hotmail e-mail address, it can be used as your Windows Live Messenger 
account, and Yahoo! Mail accounts can be used as Yahoo! Messenger 
accounts.
Let’s say you want to set up your AIM account on your G1. Starting from the 
account selection screen:
 
1. Touch the AIM row.
 
 The Add AIM account screen appears, as shown in Figure 12-2.
 
Figure 12-2: 
Adding a 
new AIM 
account.
 

184
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
2. Using the keyboard, fill out your screen name and password for the 
AIM service.
 
 If you don’t already have an AIM account, you can set one up right from 
your phone — just touch the Get a Screen Name link at the bottom of 
the screen.
 
3. If you want the phone to remember your password so that you don’t 
need to type it each time you sign in, touch the Remember my 
password check box to select it.
 
 A reminder appears on-screen with some sound advice: Should your G1 
ever be lost or stolen (and I certainly hope it isn’t), immediately use the 
AIM Web site to change your password so the bandit can’t sign in with 
your identity.
 
4. If you opt to let the phone remember your password, you can select 
the Sign me in automatically check box to keep yourself signed in on 
your phone at all times.
 
5. Touch the Sign in button.
And that’s it! After a moment, you’re brought to your contact list for this 
account, which I get into later in the chapter, in the “Contact Lists” section.
You add your Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger accounts in 
the same way as you add AIM. The only difference is that Windows Live 
Messenger requires an e-mail address in place of a screen name and also asks 
you to agree to terms of use before allowing you to proceed — touch I accept 
to continue. (You have to deal with this prompt only once.) Yahoo! 
Messenger, meanwhile, will prompt you for a username in place of a screen 
name, but the concept is the same.
Managing Accounts
Once you have your IM accounts set up, you use the account selection screen 
(refer to Figure 12-1) as your jumping-off point to manage and use each 
account. If you’re already signed in to a particular account, simply touching 
its row in this screen’s list will take you to your contact list for that account. 
If you’re not signed in, touching the row will first sign you in before taking 
you to the list. (You’ll first be prompted for your password if you decided not 
to let the G1 save it when you set up the account.)
Touching and holding on a row brings up one of three pop-up menus. If you 
have an account set up and you are signed in, you see a menu like the one in 
Figure 12-3.

185
 Chapter 12: Instant Messaging
Figure 12-3:
The menu 
for a 
signed-in IM 
account.
 
Touching Contact List takes you to the contact list for that account. This 
option performs the same function as simply touching the account’s row. 
Sign out takes the account offline; you cannot send or receive instant 
messages on the account, and other users of the same service will not see 
you in their contact lists. Touching Settings brings you to the Settings screen 
for the account; I discuss your options there in depth later in the chapter, in 
the “Instant Message Settings Screens” section.
If you call up the pop-up menu for an account that’s not currently signed in, 
you see the menu in Figure 12-4 instead.
Figure 12-4:
The menu 
for a signed-
out IM 
account.
 
Here, you’re presented with four options:
 
✓ Sign in: The first option signs you into your account (prompting you 
first for your password if it’s not saved) and brings up your contact list. 
This option is the same as touching the account’s row in the list if you 
were already signed in.

186
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
✓ Edit account: The next option brings you back to the screen you see 
when creating your account for the first time, allowing you to edit the 
username (or screen name or e-mail address, depending on the service) 
and password and set the password saving and auto sign-in options.
 
✓ Remove account: Use this option to remove the account you’ve config-
ured for this service. If you touch this service after the account has been 
removed, you’ll be prompted to enter new account information from 
scratch.
 
✓ Settings: This option takes you to the Settings screen for the service.
Finally, if you touch and hold on a service for which you don’t have an 
account configured, the pop-up menu offers you just one option: Add 
account. This option performs the same function as touching a service name: 
You go to the account creation screen, where you configure your screen 
name (or username or e-mail address) and password.
 
Although you can touch and hold on each signed-in account individually to 
sign out, many times you’ll probably want to sign out of all your accounts at 
once. No problem — just push Menu while in the account selection screen and 
touch Sign out all.
Contact Lists
Each of the four services has its own contact list — a list of the people with 
whom you can interact via instant message. If you’ve added accounts to your 
G1 that you already use on your PC, those contact lists have conveniently 
been transferred; otherwise, you start with a clean slate.
AIM, Windows Live Messenger, 
and Yahoo! Messenger
The contact lists for all three of the non-Google IM services supported by the 
IM application work in essentially the same way, so I’ll cover them under the 
same umbrella. Figure 12-5 shows an example from AIM.
At the top of the screen, a gray bar shows you the currently logged-in AIM 
screen name (in this case, “tmobileg1fd”). Directly below that, your current 
status is shown — this is the status other users see so they know whether 
you’re available, busy, or away (the exact verbiage of the status messages 
varies from service to service, but the concept is the same).

187

Status icon
To change your current status:
 
1. Touch the status icon in the upper left of the screen.
 
 In this example, I have my status set to Available, which is spelled out to 
the right of the status icon.
 
2. Select the status you want to set.
 
 For AIM, the available choices are Available, Away, and Appear offline; 
each status has its own icon, which you see in the upper left of the 
contact list after you select one.
 
Google Talk and Yahoo! Messenger also allow you to set a textual representa-
tion of your status. For example, Yahoo! Messenger’s default text for the status 
indicating you’re available is Available (what else?), but you can modify this to 
whatever you’d like — other users will then see this text in their contact lists. 
To change this text, touch the text box to the right of the status icon, edit the 
text to your liking using the keyboard, and press the Enter key or touch any 
other part of the screen to confirm it.
Below the status area, your contacts appear, organized into one or more 
groups. (You’re not stuck with the default groups provided when you set up 
an account, but you do need to use each service’s PC application to modify 
them.) These groups can be expanded or collapsed by touching their rows.

188
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
The topmost group isn’t actually a group of contacts at all; it’s a special 
holding area for conversations that you currently have underway. I discuss 
conversations more (after all, conversations are what instant messaging is all 
about!), in the “Managing Conversations” section.
By expanding a group and touching and holding on a contact, you are pre-
sented with a pop-up menu of commands you can perform on that contact. 
The contents of the menu vary depending on the service — for example, 
AIM calls chats IMs but Yahoo! Messenger simply calls them chats — but the 
concepts are the same:
 
✓ Send IM/Start chat: This option initiates an instant message conversa-
tion with this contact.
 
✓ Buddy info/View profile: Touching this item brings up a window with 
more information about this contact (see Figure 12-6). Depending on 
what information the service makes available to you, you may see a 
contact’s image, e-mail address, username, screen name, and current 
status (Available or Away, for example) and a client type, which simply 
lets you know whether the contact is currently using a computer or a 
mobile device such as a G1. To exit from this window and return to the 
contact list, push the Back button.
 
✓ Block: If the service you’re using supports the blocking of contacts, this 
is where you do it. Blocked contacts are unable to contact you — great 
for that pestering coworker (used in moderation, of course).
 
✓ Delete Buddy/Delete contact: Use this option to delete the contact from 
your contact list. Touch OK in the confirmation window to go ahead 
with the deletion or Cancel to back out.
Figure 12-6:
AIM’s 
Buddy Info 
window.

 Chapter 12: Instant Messaging
Adding a contact
To add a contact to your list, first select the group to which you want to add 
your new contact. Then:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Select the Add Buddy (or Add contact, depending on the service) 
menu item.
 
 The Add Buddy/Add contact screen appears.
 
3. Type the screen name, username, or e-mail address of the contact 
you’re looking to add.
 
 As you type, the application searches your contacts looking for matches 
and offers any suggestions that it can find. If you see one that matches 
what you’re looking for, simply select it.
 
4. Touch Add Buddy (or Send invitation).
Congratulations — you’ve just added a contact to your list! Some services 
and accounts require approval by the recipient before you’re allowed to add 
them to your contact list; if that’s the case, you may not see the contact right 
away.
Viewing blocked contacts (and unblocking them, if they’re lucky)
By pushing Menu and selecting the Blocked menu item, you’ll be taken to a 
screen that shows you all contacts that you currently have blocked on this 
account (see Figure 12-7).
From this screen, simply touch a contact to unblock him or her. You’ll be 
asked for confirmation; touch OK to proceed with the unblocking or Cancel if 
you want to let ’em stew a bit longer.

Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Google Talk
Gmail has its own e-mail application on the G1 that features some bonus 
functionality not found in Email, its non-Google counterpart, and Google Talk 
gets similar treatment! In this case, Google Talk is still part of the same IM 
application used by the other major services, but it works and acts a little 
differently.
The Friends list (see Figure 12-8) is the home base for all your action-packed 
Google Talk operations. The screen should look familiar if you’ve set up AIM, 
Windows Live Messenger, or Yahoo! Messenger, with a few key changes.
First off, you’ll notice an additional picture to the left of the status icon at the 
top. This is your personal Google contact icon. By touching it, you can 
replace it with a picture on your G1, which you’ll have an opportunity to crop 
into a square before saving.
Just like the other IM services, touching the status icon allows you to set 
your status, and you can also type a textual status message into the text box 
to the right. Below that, your contacts appear. In Google Talk, contacts 
aren’t organized into groups — all your contacts appear in a list, with active 
conversations at the top.

Talk Friends

 Chapter 12: Instant Messaging
If a contact in your list is currently connected to Google Talk using an 
Android-powered device such as a G1, you’ll also see a small Android logo to 
the right of the contact’s name.
 
You can get to your most-contacted contacts quickly by pushing Menu and 
choosing the Most popular menu item, which filters out folks you don’t chat 
with much. To return to the list of all contacts in your Google Talk list, push 
Menu again and choose All friends.
Adding a contact
Adding a contact with Google Talk is a lot like adding a contact in one of the 
other IM services but even easier, because all you need to know is an e-mail 
address — there are no separate usernames or screen names to worry about. 
Push the Menu button, select Add friend, and type the e-mail address of the 
person you want to add. (The application will make suggestions from your 
contacts as you type.) When you’re finished, touch Send invitation, and the 
contact you want to add receives a notice that you’re trying to add him or 
her to your contact list. If the person approves the request, he or she shows 
up in your contact list.
Feeling loved: When a contact wants to add you
The reverse holds true, too: When people want to add you to their contact 
list, you’ll receive an invitation. When this happens, you get a notification 
in your status bar and a message in your Google Talk contact list (see 
Figure 12-9).
To accept or decline (ouch!) the invitation, just touch it in your contacts list 
and select the appropriate option, as shown in Figure 12-10.

Managing Conversations
Once you have your contacts situated, you’re ready to instant message (and 
be instant messaged) like a pro. To initiate an IM conversation with someone, 
just touch the person’s name in the contact list of any of your services — 
keep in mind you have to be signed in first — and you are brought into the 
conversation view (see Figure 12-11).
Sending new messages works much like sending a new SMS message from the 
Messaging application — just type your message in the box at the bottom of 
the screen and press Enter on the keyboard or touch Send on the screen.
As you receive messages, you’ll be notified in a couple of ways. Most impor-
tantly, you receive a notification in the status bar (unless you’ve turned off 
notifications in Settings, which I cover later in the chapter, in the “Instant 
Messaging Settings Screens” section). When a notification arrives, you can 
pull down the notifications screen (see Figure 12-12) and touch the new 
notification to go directly to the conversation.

For services other than Google Talk, the conversation appears also in your 
group of active conversations, which is at the top of each service’s contact 
list. In the case of Google Talk, you simply see the contact change to a 
“bubble” within your contact list, as shown in Figure 12-13, to indicate that 
you now have an active conversation with the contact.

Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Pushing the Menu button while in an active conversation brings up a slightly 
different menu depending on the service you’re using. Some of these 
commands are duplicates of commands found elsewhere in the application 
(such as Block), but others bear explanation here. Let’s have a look at the 
highlights:
 
✓ Contact list/Friends list: This option returns you to your contact list. 
You can also push the Back button to accomplish the same function. 
(Choices are good, right?)
 
✓ Switch chats: When you have multiple conversations going at once, it’s 
convenient to be able to switch between them without first having to go 
back to your contact list and touch another contact. The Switch chats 
menu item lets you do just that. Touching it brings up a box (see Figure 
12-14) with a list of all your contacts (regardless of service) with whom 
you presently have an active conversation; just touch a contact to flip to 
that contact’s conversation screen.
 
✓ Add to chat: With Google Talk, you can get a group chat going — a 
conversation between multiple contacts at once. (Think of it as a textual 
party line.) Touching this option brings up a list of contacts you can 
add, and touching a contact in the list sends the person an invitation to 
join the chat.
 
✓ Insert smiley: These days, we’ve gone far beyond the basic emoticons 
like :-) and :-(. Now we have to worry about :-X, B-), and o_O too! 
Fortunately, you can use this option to select from the IM application’s 
library of emoticons, so there’s no need to commit them all to memory. 
The list of available emoticons varies because each service’s PC applica-
tion can automatically translate certain emoticons to images — turning 
:-) into an actual image of a smiley face, for example — so only the ones 
that can be translated by that service are displayed.

 Chapter 12: Instant Messaging
Instant Messaging Settings Screens
Pushing Menu from within any service’s contact list screen will give you 
access to that particular service’s Settings. You can access them also by 
touching and holding the service’s row in the account selection screen and 
choosing Settings. AIM, Windows Live Messenger, and Yahoo! Messenger all 
share identical Settings screens, while Google Talk’s is slightly different. I 
explain those differences as I walk through all the items here:
 
✓ Automatically sign in: This option is available only in Google Talk. 
Unlike the other services, Google Talk has no account setup screen 
(your account is built into the G1 as soon as you set it up for the first 
time). You use this option to configure automatic sign-in for the service. 
It simply keeps you signed in, if you dare make yourself available via 
instant message to ravenous friends, family, and coworkers at all times!
 
✓ Mobile indicator: This menu option is available only in Google Talk. 
When you select this option, your contacts can see that you’re using a 
phone to communicate with them, which lets them know that they 
should expect slightly slower responses than if you were on your PC. 
(The phone could be in your pocket, after all, and most of us aren’t as 
fast typing with our thumbs as we are with our full hands.)
 
✓ Hide offline contacts: This option is not available in Google Talk. This 
item hides your contacts that aren’t currently online from your contact 
list, so you don’t end up with a jumbled, overcrowded list of people you 
can’t contact. Good for heavy IM users with lots of contacts.
 
✓ IM notifications: This option enables notifications of new instant 
messages via Android’s notification system. In other words, you’ll see 
the messages in the status bar and the pull-down notifications screen. 
This option is enabled by default, and it’s highly recommended; 
otherwise, knowing when you’ve received a new IM can be difficult.
 
✓ Vibrate: When this option is enabled, the phone briefly vibrates when 
you receive a new instant message.
 
✓ Sound: This option is not available in Google Talk; you always hear a 
sound for Google Talk messages unless the phone is in Silent mode. 
When this option is selected, the service plays a sound when you 
receive an instant message.
 
✓ Select ringtone: This option allows you to select the sound that is 
played when an instant message is received (bear in mind that this 
option has no effect if you deselect the Sound check box). Touching 
this item brings up a menu of available sounds; select a sound to 
hear a preview. When you find a sound you like, touch OK to confirm 
your selection. Touch Cancel to revert to the previous selection.

196
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
When you add in four major services of instant messaging to the G1’s huge 
spread of communications tools, you’ll find that you’re as connected (heck, 
maybe more connected) from the palm of your hand than you are in front of 
your PC. Just make sure to do yourself a favor and try to keep ’em all turned 
off when you’re trying to catch a little R&R on the beach, okay? You’ll thank 
me later!

In This Chapter

T
he G1 includes a memory card slot that supports the latest generation of 
high-capacity microSD (commonly known as microSDHC — try saying 
that five times fast) cards, so the phone can swallow 16GB of storage capacity 
or more. Elephants may never forget, but even the mightiest pachyderms 
don’t hold a candle to a well-equipped G1 for storing all the music that’s 
important to you. (The G1’s a whole lot more portable, too.)
 
Your G1 may have come with a 1GB microSD card already installed. For many 
music aficionados, this isn’t enough. Cards as large as 12GB or 16GB are 
readily available from local electronics stores and on the Internet for under 
$100 — a wise and easy investment that helps turn your phone into the all-in-
one media powerhouse that it’s capable of becoming. I discuss the process of 
removing and installing memory cards in Chapter 15. (Don’t worry — it is a 
snap and takes only about 15 seconds).
Once you have a nice, fat memory card installed and you’re ready to rock, 
you can get music into your G1 in several ways. In Chapter 16, I describe 
Amazon MP3, the G1’s built-in music store where you can purchase music 
and then install it anywhere you can pick up a Wi-Fi signal. If you already 
have a ton of music on your PC that you’re ready to add, you may want to 
consult Chapter 17, where I talk about connecting the G1 to your computer to 
download (and upload) music and more.

198
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
That said, the G1 isn’t the perfect portable music player. A glaring deficiency 
is its lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, also known as a 1/8-inch jack or a mini 
jack — the universal standard for connecting headphones in modern players. 
Instead, the phone offers audio through its ExtUSB jack, so you have to use 
the special headphones that were included (which aren’t going to fit the bill if 
you’re picky about sound quality) or use a separate 3.5mm adapter. The 
adapter’s just one more thing to carry around — and one more thing to lose.
Android’s built-in music player probably isn’t the most full-featured you’ve 
ever used; it’s a back-to-basics application that just gets the job done with 
a few frills thrown in for good measure. Of course, one of the great things 
about Android is that nothing is stopping you from downloading a new, 
different, better player from the Market (which I cover in Chapter 18) or 
another source, but that doesn’t overcome the G1’s lack of a 3.5mm jack. 
Ultimately, I like to look at the G1 as an “in case of emergency” music player; 
it gets the job done, but if you’re the type of person who is hard to catch 
without a pair of earbuds on your face, you might be better off carrying a 
separate dedicated device (such as an iPod or a Zune) as well.
In this chapter, you find out how to maximize the G1’s Music application, 
discovering a few tricks along the way. By the end of this little journey, you’ll 
be rocking out with the best of ’em.
Choose Your Destiny: Headphones 
or Loudspeaker
Normally you’ll want to keep your funky beats to yourself, which is why you 
have headphones. (Well, okay, maybe you’d rather share your tunes with the 
world, but the rest of us enjoy our peace and quiet, thank you very much!) 
Occasionally, though, you might find that the headphones aren’t convenient, 
you don’t have them with you, or you just have to share that new Celine 
Dion track with a friend. Fortunately, the G1 gives you a pretty decent way 
to do that.
If you plug in headphones, music is automatically piped through them and 
you won’t hear anything coming from the G1 itself. If you don’t plug in the 
headphones, however, the G1 automatically knows to play music over its 
loudspeaker — the same speaker it uses for the ringer and speakerphone.
If you turn the phone over so its back side is facing toward you, you’ll notice 
a tiny bump right below the speaker grate. This bump was ingeniously 
included so that the speaker wouldn’t be muffled by placing the phone 

199
 Chapter 13: Rock Out with the G1’s Music Player
face-up on a surface. It’s most handy for the ringer so that you can actually 
hear when someone is calling you after you’ve set your phone down, but it 
serves the convenient dual purpose of making music audible, too.
You’ll likely find that the loudspeaker mode isn’t helpful unless you’re in a 
very quiet room, and even then, you’ll want the phone at or near the 
maximum volume setting. That said, though, the sound is surprisingly clear. 
It’s no boom box, but it’ll take care of business in a pinch.
Starting the Music Application
If you’re not already playing music, you can start the Music application the 
same way you would any other app: just navigate to the Applications tab 
from the Home screen and touch its icon (or touch the icon on the Home 
screen itself, if you’ve added a shortcut there).
If music is currently playing, however, there’s a second way to start the 
Music app, which I get to in a moment. But first, a quick explanation of the 
Music application’s use of Android’s notification system is in order. The 
application cleverly makes use of the notification system to help you keep 
tabs on what’s playing right now — a handy shortcut for checking a track 
name without having to go all the way into the app. When a track is playing, 
you see a play symbol in the status bar, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
Figure 13-1: 
The Music 
app’s status 
bar icon.
 
Play symbol is visible when a track is playing
Pulling down the notifications screen (see Figure 13-2) reveals the name of 
the track, the artist, and the album in a special section of the screen labeled 
Ongoing. These aren’t one-time notifications such as a new text message or 
e-mail. Instead, they remain in the notifications screen until a certain condi-
tion has changed. In this case, the current condition is that music is playing, 
so you’ll see this notification until the music stops.
I promised that I’d reveal a second way to open the Music application — lo 
and behold, here it is. Simply touch the notification here to open it, and you 
are taken straight to the Playback screen to see details about the track and 
control playback.

Browsing and Searching Your Music
Opening the Music application for the first time will take you to the Library 
screen (see Figure 13-3), which you can think of as the home base for your 
music browsing and searching activities. From here, you can view lists of 
music on your G1 organized by artist or album, see a listing of all tracks, or 
check out your playlists.
 
Figure 13-3: 
The Library 
screen.
 

201
 Chapter 13: Rock Out with the G1’s Music Player
 
As when using iTunes, an iPod, or any other software or hardware designed to 
play digital music tracks, accurate and complete track information is impor-
tant! The G1 fully and correctly organizes each track only when its artist name, 
album name, year, album artwork, and track number are filled out. The Music 
application will do its best to work with incomplete information, but if you find 
a lot of “Unknown artist” or “Unknown album” labels while playing your tunes, 
you’re best off spending some time filling out that information using the music 
player on your PC. Many modern software players (including iTunes) can ana-
lyze your music and attempt to fill in missing information, so using a PC-based 
music application first is a good time-saver to try before editing information 
yourself.
Pushing Menu when in the Artists, Albums, or Songs screens will give you 
similar choices:
 
✓ Library: The top option returns you to the Library screen, where you 
can select the Artists, Albums, Songs, or Playlists screens.
 
✓ Playback: This command opens the Playback screen — some software 
and media players refer to this as the Now Playing screen. I talk more 
about everything this screen can do later in the chapter, in the section 
titled “The Playback Screen.”
 
✓ Shuffle all: Choose this option to shuffle everything you currently see 
into one big randomly generated playlist.
 
✓ Play all: The Songs screen offers this additional menu item, which 
simply plays all songs in alphabetical order; no shuffling is applied.
Browsing artists
To browse your music collection by artist, touch the white box labeled 
Artists or select it with the trackball (an orange border surrounds the 
box when it’s selected). This brings you to the Artists screen, shown in 
Figure 13-4.
Each row represents an artist whose music is loaded into the phone. Below 
the artist’s name, you see the number of complete albums loaded (if any) and 
the total number of songs by that artist loaded. The rows start out in the col-
lapsed state (indicated by a right-facing arrow to the left of the artist’s name). 
By touching a row, you expand it, revealing the albums available to you.
 
Even if you have loaded only a partial album (or just a single song from an 
album) the G1 still organizes the tracks into the albums on which they appear.

Each album (or partial album) listed under an expanded artist displays the 
album name, the number of tracks you have loaded on your G1 from that 
album, and the year the album was released (if the G1 can gather that infor-
mation from the track data). You also see a thumbnail view of the album 
artwork to the left if it’s available; if not, you’ll see a generic image of a CD.
If a song is currently loaded in the Playback screen — regardless of whether 
it’s paused or playing — you see an orange play icon (a forward arrow) in the 
lower-right corner of that artist’s or album’s row.
Touching an individual album’s row takes you to the track listing for that 
album. This screen operates in the same way as when you’re browsing all 
songs on your G1 (see the ”Browsing songs” section later in the chapter), 
except you see only tracks on the specific album you selected. Additionally, 
the tracks are presented in correct album order (instead of alphabetically) if 
the track numbers are present in the files.
Touching and holding on an artist or an album in Artists screen displays the 
same pop-up menu. Let’s take a look at the items you’ll find there:

203
 Chapter 13: Rock Out with the G1’s Music Player
 
✓ Play: If this menu item is selected for an artist, all albums by that artist 
are played in alphabetical order, and the tracks within each album are 
played in the order in which they appear on the album. Touching this 
option while an individual album is selected plays just that album’s 
tracks.
 
✓ Add to playlist: This option adds the artist’s or album’s tracks to the 
current playlist, to a playlist you’ve previously saved, or to a new one. I 
touch on playlists later in the chapter.
 
✓ Delete: The final option removes all the tracks for the selected artist or 
album from the phone’s memory. In the confirmation window that 
appears, select OK to continue with the deletion or Cancel to back out.
Browsing albums
To browse all albums on your phone, go to the Library screen (you can 
return to it from anywhere in the Music application by pushing Menu and 
selecting the Library menu item) and select the white box labeled Albums. 
You see a screen that looks like Figure 13-5.
The function of this screen is simple: It gives you a list of all available albums 
(and partial albums). Each album is represented by a row that tells you the 
album’s name at the top, followed by the artist and the number of songs from 
that album that you have on the G1 — this number will not be the total 
number of tracks on the album if you haven’t loaded the entire album onto 
the phone.
Figure 13-5:
The Albums 
screen.
 

204
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Touching an album takes you to its full track listing — the same screen you 
see when you select an album from the Artists screen. Similarly, you get the 
same pop-up menu you’re already familiar with from the Artists screen by 
touching and holding on any of the albums; from this menu, you can play the 
entire album in its correct track order, add it to your current or a new play-
list, and delete the album from your G1.
Browsing songs
If you’re looking for a simple list of every track you have on your phone 
sorted in alphabetical order, the Songs screen shown in Figure 13-6 is your 
new best friend. To get to it, touch or select the white box labeled Songs from 
the Library screen.
For each track, you see its name, album name, and artist name on the left, 
accompanied on the right by the duration of the track in minutes and sec-
onds. From here, you can simply touch or select a track to play it. Touching 
and holding on a track displays a pop-up menu with the following items:
 
Figure 13-6: 
The Songs 
screen.
 
Artist’s name
Album name

205
 Chapter 13: Rock Out with the G1’s Music Player
 
✓ Play: This option simply plays the selected track, which is the same as 
touching the track’s row.
 
✓ Add to playlist: This option adds the track to the current playlist, a 
saved playlist, or a new playlist that can be saved.
 
✓ Use as phone ringtone: Select this option to use the selected track as 
your default ringtone for received calls. A cool, quick, easy way to hear 
your favorite song every time someone dials you up!
 
✓ Delete: When you want to remove the track from your phone’s memory, 
select this option. You’ll be presented with a confirmation window. 
Touch OK to go ahead with the deletion or Cancel to back out.
Searching your music
If one of those expansive 16GB microSDHC cards is installed in your G1, you 
have a ton of space to add music — but the downside is that it becomes 
harder and harder to browse through lists of artists, albums, or individual 
tracks to find something. To put things in perspective, if you were to fill a 
16GB card to capacity, you could have well over 3,000 songs!
Well, no Google-created application would be complete without incredible 
searching capability, would it? Of course not, and the Music application is no 
exception.
Say you’re looking for the group Flight of the Conchords. Here’s what 
you’d do:
1. From wherever you happen to be in the Music app, push Menu.
2. Select the Library menu item.
 
 This returns you to the Library screen.
3. Push Menu again and select Search.
 
 Alternatively, if you already have the keyboard open, you can simply 
press the Search key without pushing Menu. (You need the keyboard 
open anyway to complete the next step.)
 
 You are taken to the Search screen. This is an interesting view of your 
music — artists, albums, and individual songs are lumped together into 
a single, huge, searchable list.

206
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
4. Start typing flig.
 
 As you type (see Figure 13-7), each letter appears to float in the lower 
center area of the screen, and the Music application searches through 
all your artists, album, and individual track names, looking for words 
that match what you’ve typed so far. Anything that doesn’t match is 
filtered out, so as you type more letters, the list becomes more and 
more filtered until finally only the artist, album, or track you’re looking 
for is displayed. If you make a mistake, just use the Backspace key as 
you would in any text field in Android.
 
 Note that an icon appears on the left side of each row — this indicates 
whether that row represents an artist (a silhouette of a person behind a 
microphone), an album (a CD icon), or a track (a treble clef).
 
5. When you see what you’re looking for, touch it or select it with the 
trackball. 
 
 Depending on what you touch, a different action occurs:
 
• An artist: You see a list view of all albums and partial albums by 
that artist.
 
• An album: You see a list view of the tracks on that album.
 
• A track: The track immediately begins playing.

Conchords

screen.
 
Managing Your Playlists
If you plan on listening to more than a single track or two, odds are you’d like 
your music player to do the heavy lifting of deciding what track is going to 
play next — otherwise, you’ll be going into the app every five minutes to 
select the next song. Where’s the fun in that? The G1’s Music application 
includes plenty of options for creating and maintaining playlists that should 
keep the beat going for as long as you need it to.

207
 Chapter 13: Rock Out with the G1’s Music Player
The Playlists screen
You can see all playlists saved on your G1 by going to the Playlists screen, 
which is accessible from the Library screen by selecting the white box 
labeled Playlists.
To start playing a playlist, just touch its row. The first track in the playlist 
starts playing, and as each track ends, the Music application selects the next 
track in the playlist and starts playing it.
When you first get started using the Music application, you won’t have 
created any playlists (but don’t feel bad — we’ll get to that in just a moment). 
The only thing you’ll see here is an automatic playlist called Recently added 
that the Music application generates and maintains for you.
 
The Recently added playlist is simply a playlist of all the songs that have been 
recently added to your G1. Just bought and loaded a few albums that you’re 
excited to hear? Recently added is the best place to do it.
By default, Recently added includes music that you’ve added in the past two 
weeks, but you can adjust this. To do so:
 
1. Touch and hold on the Recently added item until a pop-up menu 
appears.
 
 You see two options, Play and Edit. Play starts playing the playlist, just 
as touching the playlist’s row does.
 
2. Select the Edit menu item.
 
 You see a list like the one shown in Figure 13-8, where you can select 
how many weeks back from today you want included in the Recently 
added playlist. (You can choose anywhere from 1 to 5 weeks.)
 
Figure 13-8:

208
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Creating a playlist
You can create a new playlist in several ways, each of which you may find 
useful in different situations:
 
✓ From a track, an album, or an artist in a list: Whenever you’re looking 
at a list of tracks, albums, or artists, you can touch and hold on an item 
to get a pop-up menu and select Add to playlist. From the window that 
appears, select New to indicate that you want to create a new playlist. 
You are prompted for the name of the playlist, as in Figure 13-9 (“Totally 
awesome ABBA tracks,” for instance). Press OK to add your saved 
playlists for future use.
 
✓ From an automatically generated playlist: Say you’ve decided to shuffle 
all the tracks on your G1 using the Shuffle all menu item in the Songs 
screen, and you really like the way they’ve been shuffled. Wouldn’t it be 
nice if you could save this playlist permanently for posterity? You can! 
Pushing Menu while looking at the current playlist reveals a Save as 
playlist menu item, which when pressed prompts you for a name for the 
new playlist. Touching OK commits the playlist to your list in the 
Playlists screen.
 
✓ From the Playback screen: Pushing Menu from the Playback screen 
gives you an Add to playlist option. Selecting this item and selecting 
New in the next window that appears adds the currently playing track to 
a new playlist with a name of your choosing.
Figure 13-9:
Choosing 
the name 
of a new 
playlist.
 
Adding music to an existing playlist
In the process of trying out the different ways to create a playlist, you may 
have noticed something interesting: In addition to creating a playlist by 
selecting New, you had the option of adding the selected item to the current 
playlist or any of the other playlists you’ve previously saved. 

209
 Chapter 13: Rock Out with the G1’s Music Player
If you touch and hold on a track, an album, or an artist and select Current 
playlist from the Add to playlist pop-up menu, the playlist that’s currently 
playing will have the selected track, album, or artist tacked on to the end of 
it. This is handy if you just need a few hours of music right now and none of 
your playlists matches your mood — you can start some music playing while 
continuing to work on the playlist. It’s almost like you’re a DJ, except you’re 
working with one G1 instead of two turntables.
If you select the name of one of the playlists you’ve previously saved, the 
selected item will go to the selected playlist instead. If you’re in the process 
of creating a playlist out of individual tracks from different artists and 
albums, you’ll want to select New to create a new named playlist the first 
time you select a track; on each subsequent selection, you select the name of 
the playlist that you just created.
Editing a playlist
From the Playlists screen, you can delete existing playlists, rename them, and 
rearrange and delete individual tracks within them. Return to the Playlists 
screen and touch and hold on a playlist that you’ve created (not Recently 
added). You get a pop-up menu with four menu items:
 
✓ Play: This option simply plays the selected playlist — the same as 
touching it.
 
✓ Delete: This command deletes the playlist from your phone.
 
 Deleting a playlist doesn’t delete the music that’s in the playlist — it 
deletes just the playlist itself.
 
✓ Edit: Touch this option to rearrange tracks in or delete tracks from a 
playlist.
 
✓ Rename: Use this option to rename a playlist.
Let’s take a closer look at the Edit option. Touch and hold on a playlist that 
you’ve created and choose Edit. You see a screen similar to Figure 13-10.
Notice the “grabbers” that appear to the left of each track. By touching 
these circular icons and holding down, you can move tracks around 
to reorder them — it’s that easy. To remove a track altogether, touch and 
hold its row and choose Remove from playlist from the pop-up menu that 
appears.

The Playback Screen
As you may have noticed from earlier in the chapter, there’s no shortage of 
ways to get into your Playback screen. You can get there from the menus of 
the Artists, Albums, Songs, and Playback screens; from the notifications 
screen when a track is currently playing; and also from a gray bar at the 
bottom of the Library screen that lists the currently loaded track and artist 
name. It may seem like overkill to provide so many ways to get to a single 
screen in a single application, but the Playback screen is pretty freakin’ 
important: It’s how you control what you’re listening to, after all!
Ringtones, the law, and you
With the amount of press swirling around the 
RIAA (Recording Industry Association of 
America) and its pursuit of folks illegally down-
loading and distributing music, it’s fair to ask 
whether turning a track you legally purchased 
(or otherwise acquired) into a ringtone is within 
the bounds of the law. The short answer is 
“yes.” A recent court ruling determined that 
ringtones aren’t considered derivative works of 
an artist, which would be subject to additional 
royalties. Some contention exists as to whether 
ringtones constitute a public performance of a 
song — another contingency that would 
demand that more money be paid to the pub-
lisher — but the Copyright Office’s current 
stance is that they’re for private use, even 
though others can hear them.

 Chapter 13: Rock Out with the G1’s Music Player
When you arrive at the Playback screen (see Figure 13-11), you’re presented 
with a wealth of information and options, so let’s break down everything 
you’re seeing here.
At the upper left, the album artwork for this track appears (it’s simply a 
larger version of the thumbnail you see in the Albums screen). To its right, 
three icons appear, in the following order:
 
✓ Now playing: The first icon shows you the playlist that’s currently play-
ing. Touching this icon takes you to a playlist editing screen where you 
can see what tracks are coming up next, rearrange and remove tracks, 
and save the playlist to your Playlists screen (this is handy, for example, 
if you’re listening to a shuffled mix that isn’t already saved as a perma-
nent playlist). When you’re in this view, the track that’s playing right 
now is indicated with an orange play icon in the lower-right corner of 
the row.
 
✓ Shuffle: When you touch this icon, it turns from gray to green, and you 
receive a message on the screen indicating that Shuffle is on. This option 
shuffles the tracks in the playlist you’re currently playing. To disable 
Shuffle mode, touch the icon again.
 
✓ Repeat: Touching this icon the first time repeats all songs in the playlist; 
that is, when the Music application reaches the end of the playlist, it 
loops back to the beginning and starts over. Touching the icon a second 
time repeats only the song that’s currently playing (so it better be a 
good one). A third touch turns off Repeat mode.

Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Below the album artwork, you see the artist, album, and track name, pre-
sented in that order.
Next, icons to the left and right allow you to move one track backward and 
forward in your current playlist, while the icon in the center plays and pauses 
(the icon changes to pause when you’re playing, and vice versa). The time to 
the left is the current position in the track, and the time to the right is the 
total length of the track.
Below those controls, a bar visually indicates how far you are through the 
track. By touching any position on the bar, the track will jump to that posi-
tion. You can also drag your finger back and forth along the bar to “scrub” 
the track — if the music is playing, you continue to hear the current position 
of the track as you move the slider. It’s a handy feature for quickly (and 
audibly) finding the location of a song or audiobook that you want to play.
 
Want to find out more about that great jam you’re currently listening to? The 
Music app makes it easy. Just touch and hold on the artist, album, or track 
name, and after a moment you’ll see a pop-up menu (see Figure 13-12) that lets 
you search for the name in the Amazon MP3 music store, on the Web using 
Google search, or in YouTube. These options are great ways to get more 
music, info, and videos on that hot new musician.

 Chapter 13: Rock Out with the G1’s Music Player
Pushing the Menu button from the Playback screen will give you a handful of 
options that’ll come in handy at one time or another:
 
✓ Party shuffle: This is really just a fancy way of saying “take all the tracks 
on my G1 and mix ’em up.” By selecting this menu item, the Shuffle 
icon toward the upper right of the Playback screen changes from two 
interchanging arrows to a mirror ball (yes, just like the kind they use in 
disco halls), and the first track immediately begins playing. You can turn 
off Party shuffle by touching the Shuffle icon or the Party shuffle menu 
item again.
 
✓ Add to playlist: As I mentioned earlier in the chapter, one of the places 
where you can create a new playlist is from right here in the Playback 
screen. Touching this menu item will let you add the playing track to the 
current playlist (although I’m not sure why you’d want to do that, since 
it’s already in the current playlist), to a new playlist, or to one of your 
saved playlists.
 
✓ Use as ringtone: Like what you hear? Why not hear it every time some-
one calls? Just touch this menu item and the current song becomes your 
default ringtone.
 
✓ Delete: This option deletes the song that you’re currently listening to 
from memory.
If you’ve been following along in this chapter and testing out the Music app 
on your G1 as you go, there’s a good chance your ears are ringing by now — 
good thing you only have to read this book, isn’t it? When you’re ready to put 
Metallica on pause for a few minutes, follow me into Chapter 14, where we 
look at some of Android’s smaller (but no less important!) applications.

Chapter 14
Best of the Rest: Alarm Clock, 
Calculator, and YouTube
In This Chapter
▶ Setting one-time and recurring alarms
▶ Choosing between the Basic and Advanced calculator panels
▶ Browsing and searching for YouTube videos
▶ Sharing videos with friends
▶ Keeping a list of favorite videos 
O
dds are pretty good that you’ll spend most of your precious G1 time 
using heavy-hitting applications such as Contacts, Calendar, Maps, and 
the Browser, but Google has thrown in a supporting cast of smaller programs 
that deserve an honorable mention.
You may use the Alarm Clock and Calculator applications only a few times a 
year but when you need them, you’ll be really glad they’re there. All it takes 
is one night in a hotel room with a clock radio that’s impossible to decipher 
(or even worse, busted) to make the G1’s integrated Alarm Clock app pay 
dividends.
Without any built-in games, the YouTube application is the G1’s first, last, 
and only line of defense against boredom (until you start downloading your 
own applications — see Chapter 18 for that). Plus, YouTube is a Google-
owned service, so it only makes sense that it’d want to feature one of the 
world’s most popular Internet video services front and center on Android.
In this chapter, I tell you everything you need to know about setting up the 
Alarm Clock, running the numbers with the Calculator, and killing a few 
minutes with YouTube. (And yes, the material is presented in that order — 
you have to eat your dinner before you can have dessert!)

216
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Alarm Clock
Think an alarm clock is just a time that you set for your phone to beep at 
you? Think again. Well, actually it is — but in the case of Android’s Alarm 
Clock application (see Figure 14-1), it’s also quite a bit more. This program 
gets a little fancier than your average bedside aid by letting you set as many 
alarms as you want, choosing different sounds for each and setting them to 
be active only on certain days of the week.
To start the Alarm Clock, choose its icon from the Applications tab. At the 
top of the screen, you see a large clock — not quite as pretty as the clock 
widget on Android’s Home screen, but it gets the job done. Below that, you 
see a list of all programmed alarms (if you have none, you’ll see an empty 
black space here). On the left, the time of the alarm is indicated; if it’s set to 
be active only on certain days of the week, you see a listing of those days 
below the time.
 
Just because an alarm is programmed doesn’t mean it’s active! To the right 
side of each alarm’s row, a green check mark in the check box indicates that 
the alarm is set to go off. Touch the check box to select or deselect it.
 
When you move around the world with your G1 in tow, the phone will auto-
matically change its clock and time zone (as most cellphones do). Although 
entries in your Calendar will automatically change time to reflect the time 
zone change, alarms will not. In other words, if you have an alarm set for 8 
a.m., it will still be set for 8 a.m. in your local time no matter where you go.

 Chapter 14: Best of the Rest: Alarm Clock, Calculator, and YouTube
When you select the box to activate a particular alarm, the Alarm Clock 
application briefly shows a message letting you know how many days, hours, 
and minutes remain until that alarm is set to go off (convenient for keeping 
an eye on how much sleep you’re able to get before morning). When any 
alarm is currently active, you also see an icon of a clock in the status bar to 
the left of the time (refer to Figure 14-1).
If you have more alarms than can fit on the screen, a scroll bar appears on 
the right side of the screen. Just scroll through the list with your finger 
(or the trackball) to see all the alarms.
Oh, and in case you feel compelled to get rid of that big clock at the top so 
that you see nothing but your list of alarms, just push the Menu button 
and select Hide clock. (You can always bring the clock back by repeating the 
process and selecting Show clock.)
Setting a new alarm
To set a new alarm, follow these steps:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
 
2. Select the Add alarm menu item.
 
 The Set alarm screen appears, as shown in Figure 14-2. At this point, the 
new alarm has already been created and, by default, has been set to 8 
a.m. If you were to push the Back button, you’d see it in your list of 
alarms. By default, though, it’s not active — and odds are good that you 
want to set it for a time other than 8 a.m. anyway! We’ll fix that next.
 
Figure 14-2: 
Creating a 
new alarm.
 

218
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
3. To make this alarm active, touch the check box in the first row, 
labeled Alarm.
 
 You should now see a check mark in the check box.
 
4. Touch the second row, Time, to change the time for which the alarm 
is set.
 
 A window appears for editing the time. Touch the plus and minus but-
tons adjacent to the hour and minute to increment and decrement them, 
respectively. Touch the box to the right of the time to toggle between 
AM and PM.
 
5. Touch OK in the time window to confirm the new alarm time.
 
6. To change the tone used to signal the alarm:
 
a. Touch Ringtone.
 
 A list of available alarm tones appears. 
 
b. Touch a row to select it, which also previews the tone over the 
loudspeaker. 
 
c. Once you’ve found a tone you like, touch OK.
 
 Or touch Cancel to revert to the previous selection.
 
7. If you want the phone to additionally vibrate when the alarm goes 
off, make sure that the Vibrate check box is selected. Otherwise, 
deselect it.
 
8. To schedule this as a recurring alarm:
 
a. Touch Repeat.
 
b. Select one or more days of the week on which this alarm should 
repeat. 
 
c. Touch OK to confirm you choices or Cancel to discard them.
 
 If you don’t select any of the days, the alarm will go off only once — the 
next time the scheduled time is reached. However, the alarm remains in 
your list of alarms so you can reenable it simply by going to the Alarm 
Clock’s home screen and selecting the box next to it.
When you’ve finished tweaking this alarm’s options, you can push Back to 
return to the list of alarms or simply exit the Alarm Clock application alto-
gether by pushing Home. Your alarm has been set.
Editing and deleting alarms
To edit an existing alarm, touch its row in the Alarm Clock’s list of alarms 
(refer to Figure 14-1). You’ll be taken to the same screen you saw when 
creating the alarm, and all of the same options are available: You can modify 
the time, the repeat days, the alarm tone, and so on.

219
 Chapter 14: Best of the Rest: Alarm Clock, Calculator, and YouTube
To delete an alarm, enter its editing screen. From there, push the Menu 
button and select the Delete alarm item. No confirmation window asks if 
you’re sure that’s what you want to do; your alarm will be immediately 
deleted, no questions asked.
Calculator
With Google having a reputation as a geeky company, you might think that 
it’d have bundled Android with a ridiculous over-the-top monster of a 
graphing scientific calculator, but you’d be wrong. The Calculator application 
is just about the simplest part of Android you’ll come across.
The Basic panel
Start the Calculator by selecting its icon in the Applications tab. You are 
taken straight to the Basic panel, shown in Figure 14-3.
Think of the Basic panel as nothing more than an ultra-simple four-function 
calculator, the kind you might find for sale for a couple of dollars at an office 
supply store. It’s good for calculating tips, splitting a bill, or adding the 
number of times the G1’s Maps app has bailed you out of a tight situation, 
but that’s about it. You can enter numbers and commands by touching the 
buttons on the screen or by typing them if the keyboard is open. To delete a 
digit or command, touch the Clear button; to calculate your current entry, 
touch the equals sign (=) or press the Enter key on the keyboard.
 
Figure 14-3: 
The 
Calculator 
applica-
tion’s Basic 
panel.
 

220
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
When you’re using the keyboard to operate the Calculator, you can use the 
key combinations of Alt+I for subtraction, Alt+. for division, and Alt+8 for 
multiplication.
The Advanced panel
From time to time, you might find the need for an occasional pi, cosine, or 
factorial. When that happens, the Advanced panel, shown in Figure 14-4, is 
there to bail you out. To switch to this extra-fancy view, push the Menu 
button and select Advanced panel.
The first thing you’ll notice here is that your basic buttons — important 
things such as digits and the equals sign — have all gone away. That’s 
because the Advanced panel is just a few extra functions that augment the 
Basic panel to turn it into a bare-bones scientific calculator. If you want to 
work by touching buttons on the screen, you’ll need to keep switching 
between the two panels to perform tasks.
 
A better option when using the Advanced panel is to open the keyboard, 
which allows you to enter basic commands using the keyboard alone while 
scientific functions are always available on the screen.

Calculator’s

panel.
 

221
 Chapter 14: Best of the Rest: Alarm Clock, Calculator, and YouTube
History
You can browse a history of commands you’ve entered into the Calculator 
by scrolling the trackball up and down in either the Basic or Advanced 
panel. Each upward flick of the trackball will move to the next older entry. 
Once you’ve called up an entry from your history, you can recalculate it by 
touching the equals sign again or first modify it using the keyboard and the 
Clear button.
To clear your history (you wouldn’t want your rivals finding out all of your 
earth-shattering calculations, after all), push the Menu button and select 
Clear history.
YouTube
Finally, it’s time to kick back and watch some videos! YouTube on the PC has 
been a fabulous way to blow off a few minutes (okay, sometimes way too 
many minutes), and Google has done a commendable job of repackaging the 
experience for Android and the G1 — in fact, unlike some other phones with 
YouTube capability, the G1 gives you access to YouTube’s entire library of 
videos (I hope you have some free time.) In this section, I walk through the 
process of browsing and searching for enough video entertainment to ruin 
your productivity for the rest of the day — or at least until your G1’s battery 
runs out of juice.
 
You don’t have to feel too guilty about wasting some quality time on YouTube 
videos here, because the G1 will make sure that you don’t miss calls. When a 
call comes through, the YouTube application is interrupted and you see the 
caller information screen as usual.
The Home page
The first screen you see when you open YouTube from the G1’s Applications 
tab is what Google calls the Home page (see Figure 14-5). At the top of the 
screen, a horizontal bar of video stills appears — these are YouTube’s 
currently featured videos. By touching and holding on this bar and then 
moving your finger left and right, the bar will scroll. The video still that is 
currently in the center is the highlighted video, and below it you’ll see the 
video’s duration, user rating on a scale of one to five stars, the name of 
the video, and its description.

Highlighted video
Below the video stills, a list of “most” and “top” categories appears: Most 
popular, Most viewed, Top rated, Most recent, and Most discussed. Touching 
any of these will take you to a list of videos currently in the category.
Browsing videos by category
By pushing Menu from the YouTube Home page (or anywhere else in the 
YouTube application) and selecting Categories, you’ll be taken to a list of 
video categories — a convenient way to just browse around for neat stuff to 
watch. Once you select a category, you see a list of videos in that category. 
These lists are perpetual, meaning there’s no end to them — as you scroll to 
the bottom, the application loads more videos. (Theoretically you could 
reach the end by exhausting YouTube’s supply of videos, but let’s just say 
that isn’t likely to happen — especially not on your G1.)
Searching
Searching in YouTube works much the same way as in most of the other 
Android applications you’ve used so far:

223
 Chapter 14: Best of the Rest: Alarm Clock, Calculator, and YouTube
 
1. Push the Menu button.
2. Select the Search menu item.
 
 You can also press the Search key on the keyboard or simply start 
typing — YouTube guesses that you’re trying to search for something 
and displays a search bar.
 
3. Enter your search term(s) in the text box that appears at the top of the 
screen.
 
 As you type, the YouTube application looks through your search history. 
If it finds anything that matches what you’re typing, it displays it in a list 
below the search bar. To execute that search immediately, just touch the 
item in the list.
4. To run the search, press Enter or touch the Search button.
If you want to clear your search history so that no suggestions are made as 
you type in the search bar:
 
1. Push the Menu button.
2. Select the Settings menu item.
 
3. Touch Clear search history.
 
 A confirmation window appears, warning you that your search history 
will be cleared. 
 
4. Touch OK.
Video lists
Whether you’ve searched by keyword or browsed a category, you’ll eventu-
ally find your way to a list of videos, as shown in Figure 14-6.
From here, you can see thumbnail stills for every video in the list, their 
names, snippets of their descriptions, their run times, and their user ratings. 
By simply touching a row here, you’ll start playback (more on that in the next 
section).
By touching and holding on a video, you’ll get a pop-up menu of commands:
 
✓ View: This command plays the video and is the same as touching the 
video’s row in the list.
 
✓ Details: This option takes you to a Details screen for the video (see 
Figure 14-7), where you can see its full description, the number of times 
it’s been viewed, the user who uploaded it, the day it was added, and its 
YouTube URL. You can also get direct access to related videos (or at 
least videos that YouTube thinks are related) from here.

✓ Add to favorites: This option adds this video to your Favorites list.
 
✓ Share: The Share command opens Gmail and automatically creates a 
new e-mail with the direct URL to this video in the body and the phrase 
“Here’s a cool YouTube video” in the Subject line. All you need to do is 
fill out the To box with a recipient. (Of course, you’re welcome to edit 
the Subject and body fields as well.)

225
 Chapter 14: Best of the Rest: Alarm Clock, Calculator, and YouTube
 
✓ Comments: If comments have been left for the video, this menu item 
appears. Selecting it takes you to a list of comments and the names of 
the users who left them.
If the video list that you’re seeing is in one of the “most” or “top” categories 
at the bottom of the Home page, pushing the Menu button will reveal a spe-
cial item: Time categories. Selecting this option allows you to adjust the 
period of time covered by the list. For example, if you’re browsing the Top 
rated list, Time categories allows you to select whether you’re seeing top-
rated videos from today alone, all of this week, all of this month, or all time. 
(The default is just today.)
Watching videos
Once you touch a video in any one of YouTube’s many lists, it starts playing. 
After briefly buffering, the video appears along with controls at the bottom of 
the screen, as shown in Figure 14-8. From left to right, the three buttons allow 
you to jump backward by 5 seconds, pause playback (and resume it once it’s 
been paused), and jump forward by 15 seconds. Below those buttons, a bar 
appears. On the left, the current playback position (in minutes and seconds) 
is shown. On the right, you see the total duration of the video.

226
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
A gray box on the bar indicates the current playback position, and the yellow 
area represents the total amount of the video that has been downloaded to 
the phone. (Bear in mind that downloading complete videos to the G1 takes a 
little longer than you might be used to with your PC.) You can move the gray 
box left and right with your finger to set the current playback position.
When a moment passes without the screen being touched, the controls at the 
bottom disappear. Just touch the screen to bring them back.
 
Because Wi-Fi networks offer considerably higher bandwidth than cellular net-
works do, YouTube automatically shows you a much lower-quality version of 
videos when you’re not connected to Wi-Fi. If you plan on spending more than 
a minute or two watching videos and you happen to be within range of a Wi-Fi 
network that you can connect to, it’s worth your while to get the better quality 
picture.
Pushing Menu while watching a video allows you to do many of the same 
things you can do from the pop-up menu you get when touching and holding 
on a video in a list — you can add the current video to your Favorites, see its 
Details screen, or share it with a friend via e-mail.
When you have finished watching the video, just push the Back button to 
return to the last list of videos you were looking at. You can also push Menu 
and select Home page to return back to YouTube’s topmost screen.
Favorites
If you push Menu from many screens in the YouTube application, you see an 
item labeled Favorites. Touching this item leads you to the Favorites screen, 
which is simply a special list of videos that you’ve added to your Favorites 
over time. The Favorites list functions the same as any other list, allowing 
you to play back videos by touching their rows, get video details, or share 
their URLs via e-mail. To remove a video from your Favorites list, touch and 
hold on its row and select Remove from favorites from the pop-up menu that 
appears.

H
ow bright do you want your screen? What wireless networks should 
you connect to? What date format would you like to use? A phone 
as complete and powerful as the G1 doesn’t become truly usable until you 
personalize it and make it your own — and part of that process involves 
configuring its many, many options.
Although many G1 applications have a Settings screen for application-specific 
options, Android itself also features a catchall Settings application that 
manages a plethora of system-wide options. Some items that you find in the 
Settings app affect all applications equally, others modify the way the G1’s 
hardware operates, and still others help you keep tabs on how your phone is 
operating.
There’s lots of good stuff in the Settings application — so much, in fact, that 
it can be a little intimidating at first glance. Not to worry, though, because in 
this chapter we walk through every last setting in the Settings application in 
glorious detail. The sections are organized in the same way as they appear in 
the application itself, so if you find yourself needing to quickly reference a 
particular setting down the road, just jump right to its section in this chapter!

228
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Opening the Settings Application
Occasionally, you might find that certain applications on the G1 will automat-
ically open the Settings application for you. A good example of this occurs in 
Amazon MP3 (see Chapter 16) when you attempt to download purchased 
tracks without Wi-Fi enabled and connected. Amazon MP3 asks if you’d like 
to connect now, and if you select Yes, you are whisked straight into the Wi-Fi 
settings screen of the Settings application. How very convenient!
Usually, though, you open Settings through more conventional means. You 
can select its icon from the Applications tab, or you can push Menu from the 
Home screen and select the Settings menu item.
The first screen you see is a list of every category of setting that’s available 
to you, as shown in Figure 15-1. Yes, that’s right, I said category — Android 
has so many individual settings that they need to be broken into bite-sized 
subsections — and what’s more, you can scroll down to see even more! To 
enter a category, simply touch it or select it using the trackball.
And now without further ado, let’s jump right into the first category: Wireless 
controls.
 
Figure 15-1: 
The main

Wireless Controls
As its name implies, the Wireless controls category (see Figure 15-2) covers 
everything wireless about your phone: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and your carrier’s 
cellular network.

229
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
Figure 15-2:
The 
Wireless 
controls 
screen.
 
Here’s a look at the settings:
 
✓ Wi-Fi: You can think of this option as the power switch for the G1’s Wi-Fi 
radio. Touching the check box to select it turns on Wi-Fi, but you still 
need to configure Wi-Fi to connect to specific wireless networks before 
you can use it. To conserve battery power, you can deselect the box, 
which powers down the Wi-Fi radio and causes your phone to use your 
carrier’s wireless network exclusively for sending and receiving data.
 
✓ Wi-Fi settings: This option takes you to a separate screen that lets you 
configure which Wi-Fi networks your G1 will use. I cover this screen in 
the next section.
 
✓ Bluetooth: Just as the G1’s Wi-Fi radio gets a power switch, its Bluetooth 
radio gets one, too — and this option is it. Selecting this box enables 
Bluetooth reception.
 
 This check box must be selected for your Bluetooth headset to work 
with the G1. (You can safely deselect the check box when the headset is 
not in use, however — the headset will spring back to life as soon as you 
select it again.)
 
✓ Bluetooth settings: This option opens a new screen where you can set 
specific Bluetooth-related options and pair Bluetooth devices. I go 
through this screen in depth in a moment, in the “Bluetooth settings” 
section.

230
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
✓ Airplane mode: By selecting this check box, every single radio inside 
the G1 — Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular alike — is turned off in one fell 
swoop. It’s called Airplane mode because turning this option on meets 
airlines’ requirements that electronic devices not be transmitting any 
signals during flight, which should allow you to continue to use your 
phone to listen to music or run applications as you fly the friendly skies. 
(Of course, this also means you won’t be able to check your e-mail, make 
phone calls, or browse the Web, but at least you won’t have to turn off 
the G1 completely.)
 
✓ Mobile networks: Selecting this option brings you to a new screen that 
controls how the phone behaves when connected to your carrier’s 
(or another carrier’s) cellular network. We take a closer look at this 
screen shortly, in the “Mobile networks” section.
Wi-Fi settings screen
Touching the Wi-Fi settings item in the Wireless Controls screen takes you to 
a new screen divided into two sections, Wi-Fi settings and Wi-Fi networks. 
Under Wi-Fi settings, you have the following two options:
 
✓ Wi-Fi: This check box has the same effect as the Wi-Fi check box on the 
main Wireless controls screen; select it to turn on the G1’s Wi-Fi radio.
 
✓ Network notification: If you select this check box, you receive a notifica-
tion in the G1’s status bar whenever it detects that you’re within range 
of an open (that is, unencrypted) and available Wi-Fi network. By pulling 
down the notifications screen and touching the Wi-Fi notification, you 
are brought back to the Wi-Fi settings screen, where you can choose to 
configure the new network.
 
 This is a handy option when you’re in an area without high-speed 3G 
cellular coverage or you’re roaming on a carrier other than your own 
where consuming cellular data might cost you an arm and a leg. Just 
select the Network notification check box, wander around, and let your 
phone find an available Wi-Fi network for you.
In the bottom portion of the screen, the G1 displays all the Wi-Fi networks 
that it can currently find around you. The phone periodically refreshes the 
display, but you can manually force it to scan for new networks by pushing 
the Menu button and selecting Scan.
To connect to a Wi-Fi network, just touch its name in the list. If the network is 
encrypted for security, you are prompted for a key or a password depending 
on the type of security in use (see Figure 15-3). After you’ve entered the key 
or password, touch OK, and the G1 attempts to connect to the network and 
use it to transfer data.

231
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
 
Figure 15-3: 
Enter your 
wireless 
password 
to continue 
connecting 
to this Wi-Fi 
network.
 
Some Wi-Fi networks are configured so that they can’t be “seen” by devices 
like the G1. That’s not a problem, though, if you know the name of the stealth 
network. Scroll to the very bottom of the list of available networks and touch 
the item labeled Add a Wi-Fi network. You see a window where you can enter 
the network’s name (also known as its SSID) and tell Android the type of 
security the network uses. If you choose a security type other than None, you 
are asked to provide the security key or password, so be sure to have that 
handy. When you’ve entered all the requested information, touch Save.
Once you touch a network name in the list (or manually enter it) and config-
ure its security settings, the network remains in the list permanently; it’s 
a “remembered network,” and you won’t have to configure its security 
settings again the next time you’re within range of it. To make the G1 forget 
a remembered network, touch and hold on it in the list of networks and 
then touch Forget network (or, to continue remembering it but change the 
security password used to connect, touch Change password).
 
When Wi-Fi is turned on and you are within range of a remembered network, 
the G1 uses it automatically because Wi-Fi networks are typically much faster 
than even the fastest cellular networks for transferring data. In real terms, 
that equates to faster Web browsing, faster e-mail, and most importantly, 
higher-quality YouTube videos.

232
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
If the Wi-Fi network to which you’re connecting requires a static IP (most 
don’t), push Menu and select Advanced. Select the Use static IP check box 
and touch the fields below it and enter network configuration parameters as 
necessary.
 
If you’re connecting to a public Wi-Fi network, such as in a coffee shop, library, 
or hotel, you often need to first open your browser and attempt to open any 
Web page before you can browse the Web, check your e-mail, or do anything 
else that uses the Internet. When you try to open that first Web page, you are 
usually redirected to an informational page about the network you’re connect-
ing to; the page includes pricing if the network isn’t free. If you have an 
account for the network, this page is where you log in; otherwise, you might 
have to enter credit card information, a room number, or simply agree to 
some terms and conditions. After you’ve taken care of that stuff, you can go 
back to using the Internet on your G1 as usual.
Bluetooth settings screen
In the Bluetooth settings screen, you configure how your G1’s Bluetooth 
transceiver operates and what devices it can connect to. The top part of the 
screen displays the Bluetooth settings section, which contains three items:
 
✓ Bluetooth: This item does the same thing as the Bluetooth check box in 
the Wireless controls screen; selecting it enables the Bluetooth radio.
 
✓ Discoverable: When you select this box, your G1 can be “discovered” 
by Bluetooth devices that are actively scanning for other Bluetooth 
devices. You must enable this option when you are attempting to pair 
the phone to a computer or another mobile device, but not when you 
are pairing with a headset (which I cover in Chapter 4).
 
 Because allowing your G1 to be discovered by anyone who feels like 
scanning for Bluetooth equipment is a minor security concern (and an 
annoyance, since others can repeatedly request to pair with you), the 
option automatically turns off two minutes after it has been turned on.
 
✓ Device name: When the G1 is set to be discoverable, the Device name is 
the name that those actively scanning see in their list of available 
devices. Touch the row to change it.
Toward the bottom of the screen are any discoverable Bluetooth devices the 
G1 has found during its automatic scan. (You get bonus points if you find 
someone else’s G1 in this list!) You can perform a fresh scan by pushing 
Menu and selecting Scan for devices. To pair with a device, just touch its 
name in the list; if a passcode (also known as a PIN) is required to complete 
the pairing, you are prompted for it in a window that appears.

233
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
Once a device is paired, it remains in the Bluetooth devices list permanently, 
and your G1 will automatically try to connect to it whenever it detects 
that the device is on and nearby. (Most importantly, this means your headset 
is automatically ready to use the moment it’s turned on as long as you 
previously paired it.) To unpair a device in this list, touch and hold on it, 
and select Unpair in the pop-up menu that appears.
 
At the time of this writing, the G1 supports only the Hands-Free and Headset 
profiles of the Bluetooth standard, which basically means that headsets and 
external speakerphones (such as hands-free devices for your car) are the only 
gadgets worth pairing at the moment. You’ll still be able to pair to other 
devices such as computers, but until (and if) Google and HTC decide to pro-
vide updated software for the G1 that supports other profiles, performing 
these pairings won’t do you much good.
Mobile networks settings screen
The Mobile networks settings screen gives you a handful of options for 
controlling how and when the G1 makes use of the cellular networks around 
it. Let’s take a look at the options here:
 
✓ Data roaming: When this option is selected, the G1 continues to send 
and receive data even when it is connected to a network other than 
T-Mobile. Be warned — this can get very expensive when you’re outside 
the United States, so unless you’re ready and willing to rack up some 
serious charges in the name of being able to check your e-mail, you’re 
probably best off leaving this option disabled.
 
✓ Use only 2G networks: Although the G1 can connect to the newer, faster 
3G networks that T-Mobile now has available in many cities, the speed 
comes with a tradeoff: battery life. To eke out every last drop of juice 
from your battery, select this box, which forces the G1 to use 2G net-
works at all times, even when a 3G network is available. (This can be an 
especially advantageous option when you know that you are connected 
to a Wi-Fi network, which is faster than 3G anyway.)
 
 When your G1 is searching for a 3G network and can’t latch onto one, 
that’s particularly draining on the battery. If you’re in an area where 
there’s no 3G coverage (you’ll know because you never see the 3G icon 
in the G1’s status bar) or the phone periodically switches between EDGE 
and 3G mode, you can get some extra useful life out of your battery 
charge by making sure you select the Use only 2G networks check box.

234
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
✓ Operator selection: Under most circumstances, your G1 will automati-
cally select the best cellular network it can find and connect to it. If you 
want to manually override that selection, you can touch this option, 
which presents a list of all networks the G1 can currently find; touch a 
network name in the list to connect to it. Note that you’ll be able to 
connect only to networks with which T-Mobile has a roaming agreement 
in place; so, for example, you can’t typically connect to AT&T in the 
United States, even if you can see its network in this list. 
 
✓ Access point names: An access point name (APN) is simply a handful of 
important configuration settings that tells your phone how to transmit 
data on a particular cellular network. To send and receive data, the 
G1 — like any cellphone — requires a valid APN for the network to 
which you’re currently connected. Fortunately, the G1 comes installed 
with all the APNs required to connect to any T-Mobile network any-
where in the world where it provides service, so you won’t usually have 
to worry about this screen.
 
 If you travel overseas to an area not serviced by T-Mobile and use a local 
carrier’s SIM card in the G1, and you find that you do need to create a 
new APN, you typically do so with the help of documentation or a 
carrier’s customer service agent. From the Access point names screen, 
push the Menu button, select New APN, and fill out the fields on the 
screen according to the instructions you’re given. (Note that you may 
not need to fill out every field depending on the network that you’re 
connecting to.)
 
 Before you can install a local carrier’s SIM card in the G1, you’ll need 
T-Mobile’s assistance to unlock the phone, which allows non-T-Mobile 
SIM cards to be used. Just give customer service a call to get help with 
unlocking.
Call Settings Screen
With all the whiz-bang applications that Android features, it’s easy to lose 
sight of the fact that the G1 is still a phone at heart. But indeed it is, and the 
Call settings screen, shown in Figure 15-4, helps you configure many of its 
phone-centric options.
In this screen you have:
 
✓ Fixed Dialing Number: This feature lets you restrict the phone numbers 
your phone can call. It’s a convenient option when you’re lending your 
phone to someone and you’d like to keep the random international calls 
to Timbuktu to a minimum; it’s also good for a phone that you’re giving 
to a child who you only want to be able to call you. I discuss Fixed 
Dialing Number (FDN) in detail in the next section.

235
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
Figure 15-4:
The Call 
settings 
screen.
 
 
✓ Voicemail: Touching this option allows you to change the number that 
is called when you dial voice mail (usually by holding down the 1 key in 
the Dialer). Unless you have a specific reason to change this phone 
number (for example, T-Mobile has actually changed the number they 
use for their voice mail system and told you to update your phone 
accordingly), you shouldn’t have to worry about it since your SIM card 
has your correct voice mail number built-in.
 
✓ Call forwarding: Touching this option takes you to another screen 
where you can set up call forwarding for a variety of situations. By 
default, your phone is set up to forward to your voice mail number when 
the phone is busy, is unreachable (meaning the outside cellular cover-
age or turned off), or goes unanswered. The forwarding number for each 
of these situations can be changed or disabled independently.
 
 Additionally, you can use this screen to set up the G1 to always forward 
directly to another number, regardless of the situation. To do so, touch 
the topmost item, Always forward, and then type the forwarding phone 
number (or touch the button to the right of the text box to select a 
number from your contacts list).
 
✓ Additional call settings: Selecting this option opens a screen where you 
can configure call waiting and choose whether your phone number is 
displayed to people you call. (You may know this feature better as caller 
ID). If call waiting is enabled, you are notified when someone calls you 
while you’re already on a call. If call waiting is disabled, the call forward-
ing rule for when your phone is busy applies. By default, that rule sends 
callers directly to your voice mail.

236
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
✓ Operator selection: This option works the same as the Operator selec-
tion screen in the Mobile network settings screen within the Wireless 
controls screen (whew), allowing you to choose a different cellular 
network than the one the G1 has selected for you by default.
If you want to use the Fixed Dialing Number (FDN) feature to restrict what 
numbers can be called from your phone, select the Fixed Dialing Number 
item from the list. You are taken to the FDN screen, shown in Figure 15-5.
 
To turn Fixed Dialing Number on or off, you need to know a special passcode 
called PIN2 that is programmed into your SIM card. For T-Mobile, the default 
PIN2 is usually 5678. If that doesn’t work and you can’t figure out the correct 
PIN2, give customer service a call.
Before enabling FDN, you want to set up the list of phone numbers that can 
be called. Now that you’re in the FDN screen, do the following:
1. Touch Manage FDN list.
 
 You see your list of FDN phone numbers. If you haven’t set up this fea-
ture in the past, the list is probably empty.
2. Push Menu and select Add contact.
 
3. Enter a name and phone number for this contact.
4. Touch Save.
 
 Now, repeat Steps 2 through 4 for each contact you want to be able to 
call when the FDN feature is turned on.
 
5. When all contacts have been entered, push Back.
 
 You return to the main FDN screen.
6. Touch FDN disabled.
 
 You are prompted for your PIN2. 
 
7. Enter your PIN2 and touch OK.
 
 As I mentioned, the PIN2 is probably 5678 unless you changed it. If your 
PIN2 was correct, the FDN disabled item changes to FDN enabled. At this 
point, only contacts you’ve specified can be called from the phone.
To disable FDN in the future, just touch FDN enabled, enter your PIN2, and 
touch OK. You can change your PIN2 (since the default of 5678 isn’t particu-
larly secure) by touching the Change PIN2 item on this screen.

Sound and Display Settings Screen
News flash: Your G1 has a huge, bright, beautiful screen and a loud, clear 
speaker. Then again, you probably already knew that, but what you might 
not have known is how to get those lovely components under your complete 
control. It turns out that the Settings application’s Sound and Display settings 
screen, shown in Figure 15-6, is your answer.

238
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Here’s what is available in the Sound settings section, at the top of the screen:
 
✓ Silent mode: By selecting this check box, your phone won’t make a peep 
(unless you play music or videos). This option is the same as holding 
down the End button and selecting Silent mode from the pop-up menu 
that appears.
 
✓ Ringer volume: Touching this option displays a slider that you drag left 
and right with your finger to set the ringer’s volume. This action per-
forms the same function as pushing the G1’s volume buttons up and 
down (when you’re not in a media application such as Music or 
YouTube, anyway).
 
✓ Media volume: This option displays a volume slider just like the Ringer 
volume option does, but this slider determine the loudness of your 
music and videos. Using this option does the same thing as pushing the 
volume buttons when you’re in a media application.
 
✓ Phone ringtone: Touching this option calls up a window that lets you 
choose your G1’s default ringtone for incoming calls. Touching an 
item in the list plays it. When you hear a ringtone you like, touch OK to 
confirm your choice. To back out without changing, touch Cancel.
 
 Although the Phone ringtone option chooses the default ringtone, you 
can override your selection for individual contacts by editing the 
ringtone setting within the contact’s details from the Contacts applica-
tion. Check out Chapter 8 to see how to do that.
 
✓ Phone vibrate: When you select this option, the phone vibrates when 
you receive a call. This feature is handy when the G1 is doing time in 
your pocket and you may not hear a ring.
 
✓ Notification ringtone: This option lets you choose the default sound you 
hear when you receive a notification in the G1’s status bar. (Keep in 
mind that this sound can be overridden by individual applications that 
post their own notifications.)
 
✓ Audible touch tones: When you select this option, you actually hear the 
touch tone sound when you press a number on the Dialer’s keypad — 
just like that old AT&T Slimline of yours. Nostalgia!
 
✓ Audible selection: By selecting this box, you hear a brief tone each time 
you touch something on the screen. I find it annoying. Unless you have a 
specific reason to use this option, you may want to leave it deselected. 
(Your coworkers at the meeting table will thank you.)
Below these options, you see the Display settings section, which contains 
two items:
 
✓ Brightness: Touch this option to display a slider that you can drag with 
your finger to control the brightness of the screen’s backlight.

239
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
 
 You can squeeze out a few precious minutes of extra battery life by 
keeping the screen’s brightness at a lower setting.
 
✓ Screen timeout: This option sets the amount of time that elapses with-
out any input from you before the screen turns off to conserve power. If 
you find yourself frequently putting your phone down and reading the 
display without touching it, you may want to choose a higher setting 
(say, a minute or two).
Data Synchronization Screen
As you’ve experienced from the moment you first powered up your little 
hunk of Google circuitry, Android effortlessly and automatically synchronizes 
your most important data — your Gmail, Calendar, and Contacts — with 
Google’s servers on an ongoing basis. That way, you can always count on 
being able to access your latest and greatest data from either your PC 
(through Google’s Web site) or your G1.
Android’s data synchronization capabilities are powerful, but you may want 
to turn them off at times. Constantly keeping your G1 up-to-date requires 
data consumption and power, so if you’re in a situation where you need maxi-
mum battery endurance, you might want to temporarily prevent the G1 from 
phoning home for updated information. You can make this happen from the 
Data synchronization screen, which is shown in Figure 15-7.
Figure 15-7:
The Data 
synchro-
nization 
screen.
 

240
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
As you can see, all the check boxes are selected by default, which means 
Gmail, Calendar, and Contacts are updated automatically and continuously.
By deselecting the first box, Auto-sync, you prevent all three Google services 
from automatically synchronizing and you have to initiate synchronizations 
manually until you reenable the Auto-sync setting.
 
To force a synchronization immediately, push the Menu button from this 
screen and select Sync now. You can use this command whether Auto-sync is 
enabled or disabled.
Below each of the three Google services in the list, you see the date and 
time they were last synchronized. You can prevent individual services from 
synchronizing (useful if you’re using Gmail and Contacts but not Calendar, 
for example) by deselecting them.
Location and Security Screen
The screen shown in Figure 15-8 lumps two very important concepts — 
location services (such as Maps) and phone security features (such as 
locking) — into a single screen. Why are they lumped, you ask? The logic is 
that your current location is a matter of security, in a way. Just as you may 
not want certain people to know where you are at every waking moment, 
there may be times when you don’t want applications on your G1 to be able 
to find out where you are, either.
 
Figure 15-8: 
The location 
and security 
screen.
 

241
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
My Location sources section
At the top, the My Location sources section is where you decide how the G1 
is allowed to try to determine where you’re located:
 
✓ Use wireless networks: When you select this check box, the G1 can take 
an educated guess at your location by using what it knows about the 
location of cellular towers and Wi-Fi networks. Even if GPS is enabled, 
it’s a good idea to keep this option enabled (especially when using 
features such as My Location in the Maps application) because GPS 
doesn’t work well indoors or in areas where you don’t have a great 
view of the sky.
 
✓ Enable GPS satellites: As I mention in Chapter 7, GPS is far more accu-
rate than using wireless networks alone to determine your location, 
but that accuracy comes at a cost — battery life. You can help keep your 
G1 juiced for a bit longer by turning off this option. Unless you’re using 
the G1 to help you with turn-by-turn navigation while driving, you 
may find that the G1 is capable of estimating your position well enough 
without this option.
Screen unlock pattern section
The next section of the screen, Screen unlock pattern, lets you do something 
unusual (and very cool) that I can guarantee you haven’t seen on any 
other cellphone. After a typical phone’s screen turns off to conserve power, 
many models can be configured to require a numeric passcode once they 
are powered back on. This small, quick security measure prevents anyone 
pilfering your handset from seeing your data and placing calls.
Android allows you to lock your phone to make it difficult for would-be 
snoopers, too, but it takes the concept to another level. When you set an 
unlock pattern on your G1, you physically trace a pattern on the screen with 
your finger, and the phone unlocks only if you trace the correct pattern. It 
works extraordinarily well, and you might find that you can unlock your 
phone faster with a pattern than by typing a passcode.
To set an unlock pattern:
1. Touch Select unlock pattern.
 
 You see a screen that describes the process of setting and using an 
unlock pattern. To back out without creating a pattern, just touch 
Cancel.

242
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
 
2. Touch Next.
 
 A brief video demonstrates how to trace your finger to produce a 
pattern. You need to run your finger across at least four dots to create a 
valid pattern (any fewer than four dots are too easy for someone to 
guess).
 
3. Touch Next again.
 
 Now you’re ready to draw your pattern (see Figure 15-9). Touch and 
hold your finger on one of the dots; then drag to connect adjacent dots 
of your choosing until you have a pattern that you’re happy with (see 
Figure 15-10). As you drag, a gray line shows the pattern you’ve created 
thus far. Green arrows indicate the direction of the pattern.
 
 If you’re unhappy with the pattern you’ve created, touch the Retry 
button in the lower left of the screen; the pattern will be cleared and you 
can start over. Be sure to choose a pattern that you can remember — 
you need to draw this pattern every time you go to use your phone!
 
4. When you’ve drawn a pattern you like, touch Continue.
 
5. Draw the same pattern again to confirm your choice.
 
6. Touch Continue.
At this point, your pattern is set and ready to use. If the Require pattern 
check box (in the Screen unlock pattern area) wasn’t selected before, it is 
automatically selected for you at this point. This check box is the on/off 
switch for pattern locking; when it’s selected, the pattern is required any 
time the screen is turned on after it has been off.
 
Figure 15-9: 
Setting 
an unlock 
pattern.
 

243
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
 
Figure 15-10: 
An unlock 
pattern has 
been drawn. 
 
Below the Require pattern option is the Use visible pattern check box. When 
you select this option, the pattern you draw on the screen to unlock the 
phone is visible — that is, as you draw from dot to dot, a line appears. Being 
able to see what you’re drawing makes unlocking the phone a little bit easier, 
but the tradeoff is that it’s less secure because the people around you can 
see the pattern you’re drawing.
So what does it look like when the time comes to unlock your phone after it’s 
been sitting idle for a while? By pushing any button on the front of the phone 
except Menu, the G1 springs to life and shows you its standard standby 
screen (see Figure 15-11). If you push Menu, you go straight to the Draw 
pattern screen instead.
If you haven’t already done so, you can push Menu to see the Draw pattern 
screen. Simply drag your finger from dot to dot to draw the pattern you’ve 
set. As soon as you complete the pattern, the phone unlocks and you see 
whatever screen was active before the G1 was locked.
 
Because the screen unlock pattern feature prevents users of your G1 from 
dialing phone numbers while the phone is locked, a special “escape hatch” 
allows anyone to make a call to 911 (or other emergency services) without 
unlocking the phone. To get to this feature, touch the Emergency call button 
at the bottom of the Draw pattern screen — you go straight to a Dialer keypad 
where you can enter the number you need to dial.

244

If you’re really concerned about making sure that there’s no reasonable way 
for intruders to find their way into your phone, be careful — and make sure 
your hands are clean! Grubby fingers could leave a trail of grease on the 
screen that makes your unlock pattern visible to the naked eye.
SIM card lock section
In addition to your G1’s pattern lock, the SIM card inside your G1 features its 
own type of lock. When you enable this lock, you are prompted for a four-
digit number (known as your PIN code) whenever the phone is turned on.
To enable the SIM card lock on the G1, touch the SIM card lock item (refer to 
Figure 15-8). You are taken to a new screen, SIM card lock settings, where you 
can enable and disable the lock and change your PIN code.
 
Unless you’ve previously changed the PIN code on your T-Mobile SIM card, 
the code should be 1234. You need to know your PIN code whenever selecting 
or deselecting the Lock SIM card check box in this screen. I strongly recom-
mend changing your PIN code if you intend to use this feature; 1234 isn’t the 
most unguessable combination of numbers in the world.

245
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
Passwords section
The Passwords section contains only one option: Visible passwords. When 
this option is selected, the last letter is visible as you type passwords 
anywhere in Android (such as the IM application when you’re entering the 
username and password for a new account). As soon as you type another 
letter, the previous letter changes to a dot so that the entered password 
cannot be seen — this makes it a little easier to verify that you’re typing the 
password correctly. When you deselect this option, characters in passwords 
turn into dots as you type them.
Applications Settings Screen
The G1 isn’t just about the applications it includes out of the box. The phone 
is also about everything you add to it. Just like with your PC, you can install 
software to get the features, entertainment, and functions that are important 
to you. The Applications settings screen, shown in Figure 15-12, is your home 
base for finding out what apps are installed, managing them, and getting rid 
of them if you’re so inclined.
 
Figure 15-12: 
The

246
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Unknown sources section
The top of the Applications screen, the Unknown sources section, controls 
where the G1 will let you go to install new applications. By default, the G1 will 
allow you to install only apps downloaded from Google’s official Android 
Market (see Chapter 18). Software from other sources — the Web, e-mail 
attachments, and so on — is blocked from installation.
 
The Internet is a jungle, and just like on your PC, grabbing Android applica-
tions from sources you’re unfamiliar with is risky because you have no way of 
knowing whether the apps you download will damage your G1 or your data. 
Keeping the Unknown sources check box deselected keeps you safer by limit-
ing you to using applications that Google is aware of, but the tradeoff is that 
you won’t have access to as many applications. Be careful!
Quick launch section
Did you know that you can launch the Browser no matter where you are in 
your G1 by pressing the Search key and the B key at the same time? What’s 
even better is that you can choose your own quick launch key combinations.
Touching the Quick launch screen item takes you to a new screen displaying 
the letters A–Z and the numbers 0–9 listed on the right side. These letters 
and numbers represent keys that make up part of each quick launch key com-
bination; the other part of the combination is the Search key. On the left is 
the name of the application assigned to the combination. For example, you 
see that Search+B opens the Browser, Search+C opens Contacts, Search+G 
opens Gmail, and so on.
By touching any row in the list, you can assign (or reassign) that letter’s 
quick launch combination to an application on the G1. For example, say you 
want to assign Search+V to Voice Dialer. Here’s how you’d go about it:
 
1. Touch Quick launch.
 
 The list of all possible key combinations appears.
 
2. Scroll down in the list to the letter V.
 
 By default, no application is assigned to Search+V, so you won’t have to 
overwrite a quick launch that’s already configured to create this one.
 
3. Touch Assign application to the left of the letter V in the gray box.
 
 You see a list of all installed applications.
 
4. Scroll down the list of applications and choose Voice Dialer.

247
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
You’re all set — you can now press Search+V no matter where you happen to 
be in the G1’s many screens and be taken immediately to the Voice Dialer. To 
clear the Voice Dialer quick launch, return to the Quick launch screen, find 
the letter V in the list, and touch and hold on it. After a moment, you are 
asked if you want to clear the shortcut; just touch OK to proceed.
Manage applications section
If you get a kick out of experimenting with new apps for your G1, trying out 
pretty much every new package that hits the Android Market in the process, 
that’s great — we’re kindred spirits. Like me, you’ll become best friends with 
the Manage applications screen, where you can see at a glance what’s 
installed, how much space each app is taking, and (in the case of apps you’ve 
installed, anyway) remove the ones you don’t want.
Touching the Manage applications item takes you to a list of all applications 
on your phone. The list is made up of a combination of built-in Android apps 
(such as Alarm Clock and Browser), system programs you don’t normally see 
and have no control over (such as Package Installer), and applications you’ve 
installed. To the right side of this list, you see the amount of memory each 
application takes up in your G1.
 
The default sort order for this list is alphabetical, but sometimes that’s not the 
most helpful way to look at the list. If you want to see the largest applications 
(also known as “the worst offenders” if your goal is to conserve as much 
storage space as possible), push the Menu button and select Sort by size 
(descending).
Now, let’s look at a single application to see what we can find out about it. 
Touch an application’s row in the list and you are brought to the applica-
tion’s details screen. The one for Amazon MP3 looks like Figure 15-13.
At the top, you see the application’s full name and icon. Below that, the 
screen is divided into three sections:
 
✓ Storage: In this section, you see the size of the application in kilobytes 
(KB) or megabytes (MB). Next, the total size is broken into two catego-
ries: the size of the application itself and the size of any data that it has 
stored on the phone. For example, if you were to install a note-taking 
application, the total size of notes that you had created would be listed 
in the Data category while the application itself would go under 
Application.
 
 If the section has a button labeled Uninstall, you can touch it to remove 
the application. If the application is not removable (usually because it 
came with your G1 and is built into to its memory), you see a Clear data 
button instead, which you can use to delete any data that you and the 
application have created.

248
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Figure 15-13:
The details 
for an app 
installed on 
the G1.
 
 
✓ Launch by default: If this application has been configured to be the 
default application for certain actions on the G1, you can reset that here 
so that the application is no longer automatically launched by touching 
the Clear defaults button.
 
 For example, when you touch a contact’s e-mail address in the Contacts 
application, a new window appears, giving you the option of opening 
either the Gmail or the Email application to send a new e-mail. A check 
box at the bottom of the window allows you to save your selection as 
your default so that you aren’t asked which e-mail application to open 
the next time. If you’ve selected Email as your default application but 
later want to use Gmail instead, no sweat: Touch the Clear defaults 
button in Settings for the Email application, and the next time you touch 
a contact’s e-mail address, you’ll be prompted to select between Gmail 
and Email again.
 
✓ Permissions: This feature is really neat and unique to Android. With 
so many developers creating so many applications for the Android 
platform, it can be tough to decide what’s trustworthy enough to install, 
especially considering how much private and personal data you might 
have on your phone. Everything on the G1 that this application is 
allowed to access — such as the Internet and your contacts — is listed 
here, so you can make a better judgment about whether you’re 
comfortable using the application.

249
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
 
 How does this help? You can look for permissions that are out of place. 
For example, if you’ve downloaded a one-player solitaire card game and 
the permissions screen tells you that the application has access to your 
contacts, that might be a sign that the application will do something that 
you don’t expect it to. Of course, nothing here is a surefire indication 
that you’re dealing with malicious software, but you can use the 
Permissions feature as a tool to help you make that determination.
 
 Because an application can be granted many kinds of permissions, 
Android makes things a little easier by highlighting in yellow the most 
important ones — those that could potentially compromise your data or 
run up your phone bill. The rest are collapsed into a bar at the bottom 
of the screen that says Show all; just touch the bar to see the other less 
critical permissions.
Development section
Returning to the Application settings screen, you see one last item at the 
bottom titled Development. Touching this takes you to a new screen with 
two options. Selecting USB debugging allows your G1 to be debugged by 
connecting it to a PC with a cable. Unless you’re an Android application 
developer, you’ll never need to worry about this item and should leave the 
option deselected. The second option, Stay awake, keeps the screen from 
turning off while the phone is connected to a PC. (This is a particularly 
convenient option for developers who also need to stay awake — usually 
with a combination of coffee and Red Bull.)
SD Card and Internal 
Phone Storage Screen
The SD card and internal phone storage screen, shown in Figure 15-14, is all 
about your memory. Well, not your memory — your G1’s memory. This 
screen is where you see the G1’s total memory and available memory and 
(cue dramatic music) delete everything on your phone.
The following are the items in the top section, SD card:
 
✓ Total space: The first item shows you the total amount of space avail-
able on the microSD memory card in your G1. Because some overhead is 
involved in formatting a memory card for use with the phone, you won’t 
see the total advertised space here. For example, if you have a 1GB card 
inserted, you’ll see only 968MB available to you.

250
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
Figure 15-14:
The SD card 
and internal 
phone stor-
age screen.
 
 
✓ Available space: The second item is the total space on your card minus 
anything that has been stored on it — music, photos, applications, and 
so on. 
 
 Anything that you download, install, or create on your G1 will make use 
of the memory card, not the G1’s internal memory. There’s just not 
enough internal memory to go around!
 
✓ Use for USB storage: When you select this option, the contents of your 
G1’s memory card are made available on your PC whenever you connect 
it with a USB cable — just like one of those thumb drives you can buy 
from your local electronics store. The disadvantage of using this option 
is that only one device can “see” the contents of the card at a time, so 
when your PC is using it, the G1 can’t. I discuss the use of your G1 for 
USB storage in more depth in Chapter 17.
 
✓ Unmount/eject SD card: To remove the microSD card from your phone, 
touch this option first. 
 
 The Unmount/eject SD card option gives the G1 an opportunity to make 
sure it’s not using the card before you pull it out, preventing potential 
damage to data.
At the bottom of the screen is another section, Internal phone storage, with 
two items:
 
✓ Available space: This item is the amount of space available on the G1’s 
internal memory. Because this memory is automatically managed and 
controlled by the G1, you shouldn’t have to worry about it too much.

251
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
 
✓ Factory data reset: The final item is the doomsday control — the prover-
bial big red button. Touching this item clears all data from your phone 
and makes it as minty fresh as the day you bought it. Your applications, 
photos, music, and other items will all be gone, and when the phone 
turns back on, you’ll need to enter your Google account information 
over again. (If you should accidentally touch this option, don’t worry: 
You need to confirm your choice in the screen that follows. Don’t do this 
unless you really mean it!)
Date and Time Settings Screen
In the past five to ten years, a good percentage of the world’s wristwatch 
wearers have ditched their trusty timepieces. But why? Blame the cellphone. 
Not only do phones do a perfectly fine job of keeping the date and time, they 
also have a leg up on your average wristwatch by having their time set auto-
matically by your wireless network. Gone are the days of setting the watch 
twice a year for Daylight Savings (and speaking as a rather lazy individual, 
thank goodness).
Should you want to set your phone’s time or date manually, though, you can 
do that from the Date and time settings screen (see Figure 15-15).
Figure 15-15:
The Date 
and time 
settings 
screen.
 

252
Part III: Making the G1 Part of Your Life 
The Automatic check box is selected by default, which means your G1 is 
listening to your carrier’s cell towers to find the correct date and time. As 
you move around the world, the time and time zone are automatically set 
for you as long as you’re within network coverage.
If the date or time being sent out by your network is wrong (believe me, it can 
happen!) or you like to set your time a few minutes slow or fast, you can 
deselect the Automatic check box. Doing so enables the Set date, Set time 
zone, and Set time rows, each of which you’ll now be able to touch to modify.
Below these rows, the Use 24-hour format check box allows you to configure 
the G1 to report military-style 24-hour time wherever times are being shown 
in the software — just select the check box. If the check box is not selected, 
you see 12-hour time with an AM or PM indicator on the end of it.
Finally, touching Select date format allows you to choose the way that you 
see dates in Android. By default, you see a two-digit month, a two-digit day, 
and a four-digit year all separated by dashes. But if you prefer to see a word 
for the month (such as Oct instead of 10) or the year at the beginning of the 
date, you can choose those options here.
Text Settings Screen
The Text settings screen, shown in Figure 15-16, is where you set options that 
control how the G1’s keyboard behaves when you’re using it to edit text 
fields — in other words, any place throughout Android and your applications 
where you can enter text.
Here are your options:
 
✓ Auto-replace: Using a tiny keyboard with your thumbs is an inexact 
science, no matter how good that keyboard might be! Auto-replace 
senses common spelling errors when you’re typing and automatically 
fixes them with no fuss. (If you’re not looking carefully, you may never 
even notice you made them to begin with.)
 
✓ Auto-cap: If you’re working with a lot of e-mails — or you’re just a stick-
ler for literary perfection in your text messages — Auto-cap saves you 
some thumbstrokes by automatically capitalizing the first letter in every 
sentence you type. No Shift key necessary!

253
 Chapter 15: The Settings Application
 
✓ Auto-punctuate: Like Auto-cap, Auto-punctuate is a minor time-saver 
that can become a major time-saver if you write a lot of e-mails. By 
pressing the space key twice in succession, this option assumes that 
you’re trying to end a sentence and start a new one, causing a period to 
be inserted followed by a space. In other words, you won’t need to move 
your thumb over to the period key nearly as often.
Figure 15-16:
The Text 
settings 
screen.
 
About Phone Screen
The About phone screen, shown in Figure 15-17, is a brain dump of informa-
tion that describes almost everything about your G1’s software and hard-
ware: software versions, details on signal strength and battery life, and even 
a cute scrolling marquee of individuals and companies that have contributed 
their blood, sweat, and tears to make Android a reality (touch Contributors 
to see this moving tribute). You may need to come to this screen on occasion 
to read pieces of information requested by T-Mobile customer service, but 
otherwise, you probably won’t be visiting often.
 
If you use the MAC filtering feature on your Wi-Fi router at home, you need to  
add the G1’s MAC address to your router to wirelessly connect the G1 to it. To 
find the MAC address, touch the Status item in the About phone screen, scroll 
down, and look for the code below the row labeled Wi-Fi MAC address.

fter you decide to put a G1 in your pocket for the 
first time, odds are it won’t be too long before 
you’re ready to start adding your own music, games, and 
applications that can make the phone even more fun 
and useful to you. Chapter 16 shows you how to buy 
new music right from the comfort of the G1 and Chapter

matter) that you already own. Chapter 18 takes you into

f you listen to your music collection on your PC or a portable media 
player of one sort or another, odds are good that you already have a 
decent collection of digital music ready to dump into the G1’s memory card. 
But even if you don’t, haven’t you ever been out on the town, heard a song 
you liked, and wished you could buy the track (or the whole album) right 
then and there?
With the G1’s Amazon MP3 service, you can. In principle, it’s a lot like the 
iPhone’s iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, but most tracks are even cheaper through 
Amazon’s service — and all files are standard MP3s with no DRM (digital 
rights management) applied, meaning the files you buy on your G1 can be 
transferred to your computer and your other media players with no worries 
that they might be incompatible.
Amazon MP3’s library of artists and record labels isn’t as extensive as 
undisputed industry leader iTunes, but it’s pretty darned close. (Let’s put it 
this way: Unless your taste in music is really off the wall, I’m willing to bet 
you’ll be able to find a track or five that you’re interested in.) In this chapter, 
I run through how to preview and buy tracks through Amazon MP3’s service 
and listen to them almost immediately. For anyone who believes in instant 
gratification, Amazon MP3 is a dream come true.

258
Part IV: Adding Software and Media 
Starting Amazon MP3
You might think that Amazon MP3 would be a function of the Music applica-
tion, but it’s not. Amazon MP3 is its own application with its own icon in the 
Applications tab. Why is that? Aren’t you going to be playing all the music 
you buy from Amazon MP3 using the Music application anyway?
Not necessarily! One of the great things about Android is that you’re free 
to replace the built-in music player with a different application if you so 
choose. Google and Amazon recognize this, so Amazon MP3 is nothing more 
than a way to buy MP3 files directly from the comfort of your phone; how 
(and where) you use those files is entirely up to you.
When you first start Amazon MP3, you are brought to its Home screen, 
shown in Figure 16-1, where you can browse or search for music to sample 
and buy.

Finding Music
When you walk into a record store (do those even exist anymore?), the aisles 
are organized in a way that helps you find what you’re looking for — usually 
by genre, and by artist within each genre. Amazon MP3 takes some organiza-
tional cues from those brick-and-mortar stores of yore, but with a couple of 

259
 Chapter 16: Buying Music with Amazon MP3
awesome differences. One, Amazon MP3 lets you buy individual tracks from 
almost any album. Two, your G1 gives you access to millions of tracks 
instantly — and they’re always in stock. Let’s take a look at the different ways 
you can find what you’re looking (or browsing) for.
Go with the flow: Finding popular music
If you were doing the Twist in the 60’s, the Electric Slide in the 80’s, and the 
Macarena (my goodness) in the 90’s, there’s a good chance you might be into 
popular music, and Amazon MP3 makes it easy to get right to it.
On the Home screen, the first button, Top 100 Albums, takes you straight to 
the 100 albums that are currently selling most briskly on the Amazon MP3 
service. The second button, Top 100 Songs, does the same for individual 
tracks. One of the great things about buying music digitally instead of visiting 
a record store is that the vast majority of songs found on albums are avail-
able individually if you don’t care to buy the entire album.
 
You can find some amazing deals in the Top 100 lists. At the time of this 
writing, for example, I could buy the Grateful Dead’s Terrapin Station for just 
99 cents (yes, the entire album!).
Browsing the catalog
To browse through Amazon MP3’s entire collection of music, select the third 
button on the Home screen, Browse by Genre. This takes you to a screen that 
allows you to select a genre of music — Blues, Classic Rock, or Jazz, for 
example — and optionally drill down to specific subgenres where applicable.
Suppose you want to browse through the available Easy Listening albums. 
Here’s what you’d do:
 
1. From Amazon MP3’s Home screen, touch Browse by Genre.
 
 You are taken to a list of broad genres, such as Alternative Rock and 
Blues, as shown in Figure 16-2.
 
2. Scroll down until you see the Pop genre and touch it (or select it with 
the trackball).
 
 Now you see all the available subgenres within Pop — Adult Alternative, 
Adult Contemporary, and so on.
 
3. Touch the Easy Listening subgenre.

260
Part IV: Adding Software and Media 
 
Figure 16-2: 
The Browse 
by Genre 
screen.
 
You’re now looking at a list of albums within the Easy Listening subgenre, 
sorted in order of sales popularity. Anxious to buy that new Michael Bublé 
album? Hang tight for just a moment — I explain the album and track list 
screens shortly!
If you want, you can also browse genres by individual track popularity 
instead of album popularity. To do this, return to the Browse by Genre 
screen (refer to Figure 16-2) and touch the Songs button at the top of the 
screen. When you select your subgenre, you’ll now see a list of songs 
instead of albums.
Searching for music
If you’re like me, when you open Amazon MP3 you want to look for a particu-
lar song or artist that you just heard. (Sure enough, searching once again 
plays a big role in making the G1 great.) Here’s how to start a search:
 
1. Go to Amazon MP3’s Home screen.
 
 If you’re looking at any screen besides Home in the application, you can 
get to the Home screen quickly by pushing Menu and selecting the Home 
menu item.
 
2. Touch the on-screen Search button.

261
 Chapter 16: Buying Music with Amazon MP3
 
 If you already have the keyboard open, you can also press the Search 
key on the keyboard.
 
 A search bar appears at the top of the screen (see Figure 16-3). Your 
previous searches appear as a selectable list directly below the text 
box, so if you want to repeat a search that you recently ran, just touch 
or select it.
 
3. Assuming you haven’t selected an old search, start typing the song, 
album, or artist name in the search bar.
 
4. When you’ve typed enough of the name to help Amazon drill down to 
what you’re looking for, press the Enter key or touch the on-screen 
Search button.
You now see a list of album matches (see Figure 16-4); touch the Songs 
button at the top of the screen to switch to individual songs that match your 
search terms.

Part IV: Adding Software and Media 
Previewing and Buying Music
Once you’ve found whatever album or track you’re looking for — be it by 
browsing or searching — the logical next step is to plunk down some 
hard-earned cash for the tracks. Before you do that, though, Amazon MP3 
gives you the option of previewing a sample (usually 30 seconds long) of 
every track you’re interested in.
Buying an entire album
Say that you’ve searched for the album Gods & Monsters by Juno Reactor. 
As I mentioned in the previous section, the first thing you’ll see after search-
ing is a list of album matches. If you wanted to purchase an entire album 
“sound unseen” — that is, without first previewing any of its tracks — you 
can get right down to business from the screen you saw in Figure 16-4:
 
1. Touch the price of the album that you’re interested in.
 
 The price changes to the word BUY, as shown in Figure 16-5. Rather 
than immediately purchasing the album when you touch the price, you 
first see this intermediate step so that you don’t accidentally brush 
the screen and buy something you didn’t mean to — you’re always two 
clicks away from a purchase.
 
Figure 16-5: 
I’m about to 
buy Gods & 
Monsters

Reactor.
 

263
 Chapter 16: Buying Music with Amazon MP3
 
2. Touch BUY.
 
 Although you can preview and buy music using T-Mobile’s 3G network, 
you must be connected to a Wi-Fi network to download your purchased 
tracks. This is because entire music files are large — an album can be 
50MB or more — and it’s not practical to try to download that much 
data over a slower cellular connection. If you attempt to buy music 
when you’re not connected to a Wi-Fi network, you can complete the 
purchase, but you’ll see a warning (see Figure 16-6) that you have to 
wait until you hook up to Wi-Fi before getting your purchased tracks. 
(I cover the process of connecting to a Wi-Fi network in Chapter 15.) 
Touch OK here to proceed with the purchase with the understanding 
that you won’t be able to get your music just yet.
 
3. Enter your Amazon.com account e-mail address and password.
 
 If you want to enable Amazon’s 1-Click ordering so that you don’t have 
to enter your e-mail address and password every time you want to 
make a music purchase, select the Enable 1-click ordering check box 
by touching it.
 
 If you don’t have an Amazon account, you can set one up quickly and 
easily by visiting Amazon’s Web site at amazon.com.
 
4. Touch OK to proceed with the purchase.
 
 You can also touch Cancel to back out of the purchase if you’re having 
second thoughts!
 
Figure 16-6: 
If you try to 
buy music 
without a 
Wi-Fi con-
nection, 
you get this 
warning.
 

264
Part IV: Adding Software and Media 
 
5. Touch I accept to agree to Amazon MP3’s terms of service.
 
 This agreement essentially states that you’ll use the downloaded music 
legally — you agree that it’s for private, personal use, and you won’t 
redistribute it.
The application now shows you what it’s doing as it attempts to complete 
your purchase, going through four steps: Purchase started, User authenti-
cated, Credit card charged, and Queued downloads. As each step is 
completed, a green check box appears to the left of the item. Once all four 
steps are complete, you see the Downloads screen, which I describe in 
detail in the next section.
If you’re not connected to Wi-Fi, you are once again notified that the down-
loads can’t currently be completed, and you are given an opportunity to 
connect right now (see Figure 16-7). If you choose not to, your downloads 
remain queued until you have an opportunity to connect.
 
Figure 16-7: 
You can 
enable Wi-Fi 
now or later 
to complete 
the 
download.
 
Previewing and buying individual songs
Rather than buying the entire Gods & Monsters album, say you’re interested 
in buying only a track or two. By touching an album’s row (either while 
browsing or searching), you see a details screen for that album, as shown in 
Figure 16-8.
At the top of the screen is a green section showing the album’s detail. On the 
left, the album’s artwork appears. To the right, you see the full album name, 
followed by the artist, the record label, and the average rating (on a scale of 
one to five stars) given to the album by Amazon reviewers. 

265
 Chapter 16: Buying Music with Amazon MP3
Below the album details section is a scrollable listing of the album’s tracks. 
On the left side of each row are the track number and track duration; in the 
center is the track name; and to the right is a price button that works the 
same way as the one when purchasing an entire album. Just touch the price 
button to start the purchase process for that individual track.
You can still buy the entire album from this screen by simply pressing the 
button with the price on it in the top green section. Let’s say you need to 
hear a track or two before making a decision, though. To hear a brief preview 
of a track, touch that track’s row in the track listing, and the left side of that 
row changes to red (see Figure 16-9). You see the amount of time remaining 
in the preview — typically it’ll count down from 30 seconds — and a stop 
icon. Just touch the stop icon, or anywhere else in the row, to stop the 
preview from playing.
Just like the Music application, you can hear previews over the G1’s 
loudspeaker or your headphones if you have them connected. The phone’s 
Volume buttons control the volume of the preview.

Managing Music Downloads
The Downloads screen is the clearinghouse for all the tracks you’ve pur-
chased and downloaded, are currently downloading, or have yet to down-
load. When you purchase new music, you are taken to the Downloads screen 
automatically. You can also get to the screen yourself from any screen in 
the Amazon MP3 application by pushing the Menu button and selecting the 
Downloads menu item.
Continuing with the example in the last section, say that you listened to a few 
tracks on Gods & Monsters and decided to purchase the entire album without 
enabling Wi-Fi on the G1. The Downloads screen indicates that it can’t pro-
ceed with the download until you hook up to Wi-Fi, as shown in Figure 16-10.

267
 Chapter 16: Buying Music with Amazon MP3
Once you enable Wi-Fi (more on that in Chapter 15), your downloads will 
begin automatically. The Downloads screen shows you the track that’s 
currently downloading (see Figure 16-11) in a Now Downloading section at 
the top, along with that track’s album artwork, artist name, and a progress 
bar that indicates how much more data needs to be downloaded for that 
particular track. Below that, you see how many songs still need to be 
downloaded after the current track finishes downloading. At the bottom, 
you see the Queue section — the list of tracks that remain to be downloaded. 
Only one track is downloaded at a time.

While tracks are being downloaded, you also get a message in Android’s 
notification system (see Figure 16-12). You can even see your progress 
from here — when the bar fills up with yellow, all pending downloads have 
completed. Touching the notification will take you straight to the Downloads 
screen.
 
Occasionally, downloads may fail for various reasons. Amazon’s servers 
could be momentarily unavailable, you could have a problem with your Wi-Fi 
connection, or gremlins could overrun the Internet. When this happens, you 
see an X symbol to the right of the failed track. Whatever the reason for the 
failure, you can retry any failed downloads by pushing the Menu button from 
the Downloads screen and selecting Retry Failed.
As tracks finish downloading, green check marks appear to their right. To 
clear the list of completed downloads, push Menu and select Clear 
Completed.

Listening to Your Purchased Music
As soon as a track finishes downloading, it goes into your microSD card and 
is immediately available for listening. Don’t believe me? Seriously, check it 
out — just go to the Music application and your new tracks have magically 
appeared! As I mention in Chapter 13, the easiest way to find your new music 
(especially if you have a ton of music already loaded) is to use the Recently 
added playlist to quickly find new tracks.
Of course, now that you own these wonderful new tracks, you’d probably like 
to be able enjoy them on your PC, too. In Chapter 17, I talk about the process 
for transferring them.

From the Amazon MP3 Home screen, push Menu and select the Settings

purchase, select the Enable 1-Click ordering check box by touching it.

Filling Your Phone with Media
In This Chapter
▶ Installing and removing memory cards from the G1
▶ Connecting your G1 to your computer
▶ Transferring files between your computer and your G1’s memory card
U
nlike most smartphones, you could go years without even thinking 
about connecting your G1 to your PC. Why would you? Your calendar 
and contacts are being automatically synchronized with Google’s servers 
using your wireless connection, so you know that your most important infor-
mation is safe and accessible. What’s more, that information is accessible 
from not just your PC but any PC in the world where you can get access to 
google.com — so why bother ever pulling out a cable and hooking up to 
your G1 the old-fashioned way?
Well, it turns out there’s a very good reason to connect from time to time: 
when you want to transfer music and pictures. You could go a lifetime using 
Amazon MP3 for all your G1’s music needs and using the built-in camera 
for all your photos, but odds are you probably have some stuff on your 
computer — your complete collection of live Michael Bolton bootlegs, for 
example — that you’d just love to have with you in your pocket. With up to 
16GB or more of storage space on board, there’s no reason not to use the G1 
as your full-time portable music player (what’s an iPod?) and your photo 
album on the go.
When it comes to transferring large multimedia files, nothing beats a physical 
cable connection, and the G1’s ExtUSB port offers just the speed you need 
to quickly move your tunes, images, and other files back and forth. In this 
chapter, I walk you through the process of hooking the G1 up to your com-
puter. But before that, I show you how to install the microSD memory you 
need to make the G1 capacious enough for all your files.

270
Part IV: Adding Software and Media 
Installing and Removing 
the Memory Card
Your G1 comes with a 1GB microSD card (see Figure 17-1). Although 1GB 
may sound like a lot, it isn’t if you intend to heavily use the phone as your 
music player (most dedicated music players, such as the iPod, come with 
at least 4GB of storage these days). As I mention in Chapter 13, cards going 
all the way up to 16GB in capacity are readily available and surprisingly 
inexpensive.
Once you’ve bought a card, installing it is a snap (okay, it’s more of a click). 
The first step is to remove your existing card, if one is installed.
 
When you remove a microSD card from your G1, the applications you’ve 
installed remain installed, but files that you’ve downloaded or transferred 
from your PC to your G1 (such as music) go with the card. If you have any 
files on the card that you’d like to keep, be sure that either you have a way to 
later read the microSD card directly from your PC (using an SD reader and an 
SD-to-microSD adapter, for example) or you transfer the files from your G1 to 
your PC before you remove the card. You can then transfer those files back 
to the G1 once your new card is installed.
 
Figure 17-1: 
A microSD 
card.
 

271
 Chapter 17: Filling Your Phone with Media
To remove a microSD card:
 
1. Open the Settings application.
 
 You can select its icon from the Applications tab, or you can push Menu 
from the Home screen and select the Settings menu item.
 
2. Touch the SD card & phone storage item.
 
 You have to scroll down the screen to see this item.
 
3. Touch Unmount/eject SD card.
 
 The G1 stops reading from and writing to the card so no data can be 
damaged when you physically remove it. Alternatively, you can just 
power off the phone.
 
4. Open the keyboard.
 
5. Using your fingernail, pull outward on the small tab to the right of the 
rightmost shift key on the keyboard (see Figure 17-2) until the tab 
comes out.
 
 Note that the tab and the cover it’s attached to remain connected to the 
phone — you just want the cover to be dangling so it reveals the slot 
underneath.

6. Gently press the card in the slot until you hear and feel a click.
 
 The card will pop out partway (that’s the magic of spring loading). Pull 
the card the rest of the way out of the phone.
Now that you’ve removed that dinky little 1GB card, it’s time to install a new 
one. Don’t close that slot cover just yet!
 
1. Guide your new microSD card into the slot.
 
 You can perform this step whether the G1 is on or off. The gold pins on 
the card should be facing down and forward. Don’t force the card into 
the slot. If you feel a lot of resistance, you’re probably inserting the card 
incorrectly. The card and slot are both fairly fragile.
 
2. Push the card until you feel and hear a click (see Figure 17-3).
The card is now installed and ready to use. You don’t need to do anything 
else; the G1 automatically takes advantage of the new capacity that’s 
available to it.

push the 
card into

 Chapter 17: Filling Your Phone with Media
Connecting the G1 to Your Computer
Unlike some phones, you don’t need any fancy software, drivers, or a call to 
your technologically inclined nephew to connect your G1 to your computer. 
In fact, when the two are connected, your PC treats the G1 the same way it 
treats those USB memory sticks that you might buy at office supply stores — 
the G1 is just a new “drive” that you can drag files to and from. This feature 
makes transferring files with the G1 convenient, easy, and fast — just copy 
your stuff and go.
To connect, you’ll need the USB cable that came with your G1. If you mis-
placed the cable or don’t have it handy, you can also use any USB cable 
that features a mini USB connector on one end and a USB Type A connector 
on the other. These cables are common for connecting phones and digital 
cameras, so you might have one or two lying around. If you don’t, they’re 
easy to find at any electronics store.
After you’ve located a cable, make sure the G1 is on, and then do the 
following:
 
1. Connect the mini USB end of the cable (the small connector) to the 
socket on the bottom of your G1.
 
2. Connect the USB Type A end of the cable (the larger connector) to any 
available USB socket on your computer.
 
 A new symbol appears on the left side of the status bar. You may recog-
nize this symbol as the industry-standard USB logo. Your G1 recognizes 
that it’s been connected!
 
3. Pull down the notifications screen on the G1.
 
 You see a new notification informing you that your G1’s USB connection 
has been established (see Figure 17-4).
 
4. Touch the USB connected notification.
 
 A window appears asking you whether you want to mount the memory 
card to your computer, which allows you to copy files from the card to 
the computer and vice versa (see Figure 17-5).
 
 While the memory card is mounted to the computer, you won’t be able 
to access the card from your G1 — that is, you won’t be able to use the 
Music or Pictures applications, save any attachments from e-mail or 
files from the Web, and so on. Only one device can access the memory 
card at any given time, and when you choose to mount the card to your 
computer, only your computer can access it.

 A new drive appears on your computer. Look for the new drive in My 
Computer under Windows and on your desktop if you have a Mac. In 
either case, double-click the new drive to see its contents. 

275
 Chapter 17: Filling Your Phone with Media
At this point, you can simply drag files back and forth between your PC and 
your G1 — treat the new drive just as you would any other drive connected 
to your computer.
When you open the drive in a window on your computer, you may see 
several folders that were already created in your G1 memory card: 
 
✓ amazonmp3: The Amazon MP3 application automatically places any 
music that you purchase in the amazonmp3 folder. If you double-click 
the folder to look at its contents, you’ll notice that there’s one folder for 
each album (or partial album) you’ve bought.
 
✓ dcim: Pictures taken with your G1’s camera go inside a folder called 
Camera, which resides inside the dcim folder. If you want to grab some 
pictures that you’ve snapped and store them in iPhoto, Picasa, or 
another photo program on your PC, look inside dcim.
 
✓ download: Files that you download with the Browser are stored here.
Although certain programs create and use certain folders on your memory 
card, Android doesn’t need them — they’re there just for the sake of 
organization. If you want, you can drag music files directly to the root of the 
memory card or any folder of your choosing and the Music application will 
be able to find them. Likewise, you can place pictures wherever you like.
 
When you have finished transferring files, be sure to “eject” your G1 before 
unplugging it! This is an important step to making sure that your files are 
safely and completely written to the memory card. To eject the G1 under 
Windows, go to My Computer, right-click the G1’s drive, and click Eject. On a 
Mac, simply drag the drive from the desktop to the trash. (The trash icon 
changes to an eject icon while you’re dragging.)

The Android Market
In This Chapter
▶ Working with the Market Home Screen
▶ Browsing all the applications and games available for your G1
▶ Getting an app’s details, and installing and uninstalling apps
▶ Searching for specific applications
▶ Downloading applications and canceling downloads
▶ Rating and leaving comments about applications you’ve used
B
uying applications for your PC can end up being quite a process. You 
probably have to run down to your friendly local office supply or 
electronics superstore, look for the software, and after tearing 15 boxes off 
the shelves, come to the realization that the store doesn’t stock the program 
(or the version of the program) you need. Next, you hop on the Web and 
mail-order the program from an online retailer, at which point you’re in for at 
least a day of waiting — and that’s if you sprang for the exorbitant overnight 
shipping option.
There has to be a better way, right? With Android, there is. Google has 
created a full-featured software store and placed it right on your G1, so you 
never need to leave the comfort of your handheld to research and download 
the new application you want. You can be at home, at work, or waiting for a 
delayed flight in Chicago O’Hare’s Terminal 1: The Market is always ready 
and waiting for you as long as you have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection.
Anyone who’s familiar with Apple’s App Store for the iPhone will feel right at 
home with the Market, and you could argue that the Android Market is even 
better because Apple reserves the right to selectively reject applications that 
it feels encroach on its own apps. (For example, you’ll never see another Web 
browser offered for sale in the App Store — the iPhone already comes with 
Mobile Safari, and that’s what Apple wants you to use.) Google places no 
such restrictions, leaving the gates wide open to any and all developers who 
want to write software and offer it to the Android-using public. Choice is 
(almost) always a good thing, I say.

278
Part IV: Adding Software and Media 
Out of the box, the G1 comes with almost all the software you need — or at 
least that’s what you might think until you start exploring everything that’s 
available! With endless games, media players, utilities, and informative 
applets at your disposal, there’s no reason not to give the Market a spin. In 
this chapter, I show you how to take advantage of the Android Market to 
make it your one-stop shop for Android applications.
Starting Market and Understanding 
the Market Home Screen
To start the Market, select the Market icon from the Applications tab, which 
is cleverly designed to look like a shopping bag with the Android logo on it. 
You are taken immediately to the Market home screen (shown in Figure 18-1).
If you’ve had an opportunity to play with the G1’s YouTube application, the 
Market home screen may seem somewhat familiar. Horizontally across the 
top, you have access to Featured applications, which are applications that 
Google has highlighted because they’re particularly good or popular or both. 
You can scroll through the list of Featured applications by touching your 
finger to the Featured area of the screen and swiping to the left or right. As 
you scroll, the application in the middle of the screen becomes highlighted 
and is available to download. Directly below the highlighted icon, the 
application’s name and publisher appear.
Below the Featured area, four items take you to different parts of the Market 
application: Applications, Games, Search, and My downloads. I cover each of 
these items in detail throughout the chapter.
Get the credit card ready: Free apps available 
now, but paid apps coming soon
At the time of this writing, Google had just 
launched the Android Market (and the G1 and 
Android itself, for that matter). At first, only free 
applications are being offered — Google 
doesn’t have the plumbing in place just yet to 
support automatic billing and payment for 
developers offering their wares through the 
system. Even so, though, tons of cool, free apps 
are already available, and Google is committed 
to offering paid applications soon. What’s more, 
you’ll be able to download free trials of some of 
these paid applications, making it a cinch to try 
before you buy.

By pushing Menu from the Market home screen, you see three menu items 
at the bottom of the screen. Two of these, Search and My downloads, are 
duplicates of the items on the Market home screen itself. The third, Help, 
opens the Browser and takes you to the Help section of the Android Market’s 
official Web site (see Figure 18-2) where you can find out everything there 
is to know about downloading applications, managing them once they’re 
downloaded, and finding solutions to common Market problems. (By the time 
you’re finished with this chapter, though, I hope you never need to even 
think of glancing at Help!)

280
Part IV: Adding Software and Media 
 
If you were looking at a Web site in the Browser when you touched the Help 
option, you’ll notice that the Browser shows some courtesy. Instead of 
unceremoniously navigating away from whatever site you had open so that it 
could open Android Market Help in its place, it opens Help in a new Browser 
window; that way, whatever sites you had open remain open. It’s a nice touch.
Browsing the Goods: The Applications 
and Games Screens
Have you ever wandered into a store not needing anything in particular? You 
want to see what’s available, and if anything catches your eye and strikes 
your fancy, you might just pick it up. (Heck, who knows, maybe that’s how 
you ended up with this book!) I know I have, and the Android Market makes it 
all too simple.
Touching the Applications or Games items on the Market home screen bring 
you to a new screen with a list of categories. (See Figure 18-3 for the list 
of categories for the Applications item.) From here, you can narrow your 
browsing to a specific genre — say, the News & Weather category within 
Applications or the Cards & Casino category within Games — simply by 
touching the category you want. You can also view all available applications 
or games by touching the All applications or All games items, respectively. 
(They’re very, very long lists, and they’re getting longer every day as 
developers add new applications, so don’t say I didn’t warn you!)
 
Figure 18-3: 
The 
Applications 
screen. 
Look at 
all the 
available 
categories!
 

281
 Chapter 18: The Android Market
Once you’ve selected a category, you are brought to a list of applications 
within it (see Figure 18-4). For this example, let’s take a look at the News & 
Weather category in Applications.
Even with a specific category, as we have here, the list is large. For this 
reason, the top of the screen has two tabs — By popularity and By date — 
that help you sort the list in a meaningful way. Touching By popularity 
(which is selected by default) orders the applications by how frequently 
they’ve been downloaded, with the most frequently downloaded at the top. 
Touching By date presents applications according to when they were added 
to the Market, with the newest at the top of the list.
 
If you want a quick peek in the Market to see if anything is new and exciting 
since your last visit, go to the Applications or Games screen, choose All 
applications or All games accordingly, and touch the By date tab. You see 
new apps at the top of the list. If you visit frequently, you can simply read 
down the list until you see an application you recognize to get a picture of 
everything that’s been added since the last time you were here.

Below the tabs, each row represents an application you can download. To 
the far left is the application’s icon; this is a slightly smaller version of the 
icon you see in the Applications tab when the new application is installed. To 
the right of the icon is the application’s name and the name of its publisher 
(that is, the name of the company that produced the software). At the far 
right, you see the price of the application (everything is labeled FREE until 
Google introduces its billing system to the Market) and the application’s 
average user rating on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. (If you download an application 
and want to add your own rating, hang tight — I get to that topic shortly.)
Getting Details about and 
Installing Applications
When you select an application in the list in the Market, you see a details 
screen for that app, as shown in Figure 18-5. In the details screen, you can 
find out pretty much everything you need to know to make a decision about 
whether you want to download and install the application. (If you still can’t 
decide, don’t hesitate to download the application and give it a try anyway — 
odds are it’s either free or available in a free trial version.)
As you can likely tell at a glance, the details screen has a lot of information. 
Let’s take a look, starting from the top:
 
Figure 18-5: 
An applica-
tion’s details 
screen.
 

283
 Chapter 18: The Android Market
 
✓ Application icon, name, publisher, price, and user rating: This is the 
same information you saw in the list of applications before you selected 
one of them and were brought to this screen. These key pieces of infor-
mation are summarized in a gray bar at the top of the screen, and as you 
scroll through the remainder of the information, this part of the screen 
remains fixed so you can always see it.
 
✓ Number of downloads and ratings: Near the top of the screen, you see 
a rough estimate of the number of times this application has been down-
loaded (somewhere between 10,000 and 50,000 for this AccuWeather.
com app, for example) and the number of users who’ve rated it on the 
1- to 5-star scale.
 
✓ Description: Next, you see a brief description of what this application is 
and what it does. Sometimes, an applications description is unnecessary 
(AccuWeather.com probably falls into that category), but other times 
the application is a mystery until you read this section.
 
✓ Version and size: Publishers may periodically update their applications 
in the Market to fix bugs and add features. As they do, the Version, 
which is located directly below the application description in smaller 
gray text, increments to progressively higher numbers.
 
 You’ll typically find these Versions in the format X.Y or X.Y.Z, where X, 
Y, and Z are all numbers (AccuWeather.com, for example, is currently at 
Version 1.0.0). A change in X represents a more significant change in the 
application than a change in Y; likewise, a change in Y is a more signifi-
cant change than a change in Z. It’s common for developers to change 
only Y or Z when fixing bugs and adding minor features, and to change X 
when adding major new functionality or revamping the application.
 
 The size of the application is indicated just to the right of the Version in 
kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB).
 
 Currently, applications can be stored only in the G1’s internal memory, 
of which only 70 megabytes or so is available to you. I hope a future 
version of Android will allow you to store applications on your much 
more expansive microSD card as well, but until that happens, pay close 
attention to the size of each application you’re installing and monitor 
which applications you actually use and which are just stagnating in the 
Applications tab. Depending on how extensively you use the Market, you 
may find that you have to pick and choose carefully!
 
✓ Comments: The next section in the application’s details screen lists the 
most recent comments left by users who’ve downloaded it. On the top 
left of each comment row is the name of the user who left the comment 
and the date it was written. To the right, you see that user’s 1- to 5-star 
rating. Below all that, you see a snippet of the comment.

284
Part IV: Adding Software and Media 
 
 Users can be vocal, to say the least — and only a small handful of com-
ments are shown on the application’s details screen itself. To see more, 
touch the Read all comments row at the bottom of the Comments 
section. You are taken to a new screen that displays every comment 
(in its entirety, not just the snippet you see on the details screen). Once 
you have your fill of independent opinions, push the Back button to 
return to the details screen.
 
✓ About the developer: At the bottom of the screen, you’re presented 
with two items in the About the developer section. Touching View more 
applications presents a list of all applications in the Market that were 
published by the same developer — a good thing to check if you are 
happy with an application and are curious what else the developer has 
created.
 
 Have praise, complaints, suggestions, or bugs to report? The second 
item, Send email to developer, opens a window that allows you to 
choose between the Email and Gmail applications for sending an e-mail 
to the application’s developer. Their e-mail address is filled in for you 
in the To field and the e-mail’s Subject line contains the application’s 
name — just whip up the body of the message, touch Send, and you’re 
all set.
 
✓ Install, Open, and Uninstall: If the details screen you’re looking at is 
for an application that isn’t installed on your G1, you see a single button 
at the very bottom of the screen: Install. If the application is installed, 
however, you see two buttons labeled Open and Uninstall instead. 
Touching Open simply starts the application, as if you had touched its 
icon in the Home screen’s Applications tab. Touching Uninstall does 
the same thing as uninstalling an application from Android’s Settings. 
If you touch the Uninstall button, you see a window prompting you to 
confirm that you want to remove the application from the phone (see 
Figure 18-6); touch OK to proceed. As the window says, you can always 
use the Market to install the application again later if you have a change 
of heart.
When you’re ready to install an application, just touch the Install button from 
application’s details screen.
 
Before installation proceeds, you may be shown a list of things the application 
can do with your G1 and what data of yours it will have access to. Read this 
list carefully and make sure you’re comfortable with it! Items of particular 
interest are colored in yellow and shown with an exclamation point to their 
left; other less-risky items are automatically collapsed under a heading at the 
bottom labeled Show all (just touch Show all to see the full list). In Figure 18-7, 
for example, I’m trying to install iMap Weather. Android lets me know that 
iMap Weather will have access to my Internet connection and my current 

285
 Chapter 18: The Android Market
location, and will be able to modify system settings. Generally speaking, you 
don’t need to worry, because most applications aren’t trying to harm you 
or your G1. But just like your PC, malicious applications can exist for your 
phone, and you should be on the lookout for anything in this list that seems 
out of place. For example, if you were to encounter a simple video player that 
wanted access to your contacts, that might raise a red flag that the application 
might collect e-mail addresses to spam them.

Part IV: Adding Software and Media 
 
Google is constantly monitoring the Market to remove “bad” applications as 
quickly as possible. As a last resort, Google has the capability to remotely 
disable applications on your phone that it discovers are harmful. Furthermore, 
all applications that are made available in the Market must be digitally signed, 
a technique that guarantees the source of the application and prevents 
applications from being offered anonymously. That being said, it’s always 
good to take a quick glance at this list before moving forward with the 
installation — better safe than sorry!
If you’re comfortable with everything that this application will have access 
to, touch OK to continue. To back out of the installation, touch Cancel.
When you touch OK, the application begins downloading (you can be 
connected to a cellular or a Wi-Fi network for this, but keep in mind that 
a Wi-Fi network will always be faster). As soon as each application you 
download has finished transferring, Android automatically installs it so it’s 
ready for you to use.
The Market reminds you with a message on the screen that you should 
keep an eye on the notifications in your status bar for the progress of your 
download. That’s solid advice, because the status bar is where you find out 
what’s currently downloading and what has finished installing (see Figure 
18-8). At this point, you can keep browsing applications or exit the Market 
entirely — your applications will continue to quietly download and install in 
the background without any more intervention from you.
When installation is complete, the application’s icon appears in the 
Applications tab. You can also just pull down the notifications screen 
and touch the name of the newly installed application to start it. 
Congratulations — you’ve successfully installed and launched your first 
application from the Market!
Searching for Applications
Sometimes you’re not in the mood to browse for new wares for your G1 — 
you know exactly what you want; you just have to find it. No sweat. From 
anywhere in the Market, you can search for available applications like so:
 
1. Push the Menu button and then select the Search menu item.
 
 Or if you have the keyboard open, you can press the Search key or just 
start typing your search — the search bar will automatically open. You 
can also search for an application from the Market home screen by 
touching the Search row (refer to Figure 18-1).

287
 Chapter 18: The Android Market
 
2. Type your search into the search bar that appears.
 
 Your search can be composed of an application name, a publisher name, 
or a category. As you type, a list of previous searches appears below the 
search bar. If you see what you’re looking for in the list, just touch the 
item (or select it with the trackball); your search will begin and you can 
skip Step 3.
 
3. When you’ve finished typing your search terms, press the Enter key or 
touch the Search button.
 
 After a moment of searching, the Market returns a list of applications 
that match your search.
 
4. In the list, touch the item you’re looking for.

Download in progress
The My Downloads Screen
After you’ve downloaded an application for the first time, it automatically 
moves to the My downloads screen (see Figure 18-9). To access this screen, 
touch My downloads on the Market home screen (refer to Figure 18-1), or 
push the Menu button from anywhere else in the Market and select the My 
downloads menu item.

Figure 18-9:

screen.
 
 
Once you download an application, it remains in the My downloads list even 
if you uninstall it. In Figure 18-9, for example, notice that every row says 
Installed on the right side except for The Weather Channel — that’s because I 
had The Weather Channel installed at one time, but I’ve since uninstalled it. 
If you’re uninstalling rarely used applications to conserve your G1’s limited 
internal memory, the My downloads screen makes it especially easy to 
reinstall them at a future time should the need arise.
Canceling downloads in progress
Applications appear in My downloads the moment that you start download-
ing them, which gives you the opportunity to cancel a download if you 
change your mind:
 
1. Go to the My downloads screen.
 
 While an application is downloading, it appears in a special Currently 
downloading section of the My downloads screen that appears at the 
very top. The progress of each download is indicated as a yellow bar 
that moves across the screen.
 
2. Touch and hold on the application whose download you want to 
cancel.
 
 After a moment of holding down, a pop-up menu appears.
 
3. Select Cancel download.

Help out fellow G1 owners 
by rating applications
After you’ve used applications for a little while, you probably will have 
developed some opinions. Do they work well? Do they do what they said 
they would? Do they have any annoying bugs? And most importantly — 
are they worth the download?
Rating the applications you’ve downloaded on a 5-star scale is a piece of 
cake, and an easy way to convey to owners of Android devices how good 
(or how awful) a particular application is. Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Go to the My downloads screen.
 
2. Touch the row of the application you want to rate.
 
 The application’s details screen appears, but it has a key addition 
near the top of the screen that you won’t have seen before you down-
loaded the application: a My review section.
 
3. Touch Rate it!
 
 The window in Figure 18-10 appears, where you can indicate how many 
stars you want to give this application — 5 means “totally awesome,” 
and 1 means “I can’t believe I wasted my time downloading this hunk of 
garbage.” (I’m paraphrasing here, but you catch my drift.)

Part IV: Adding Software and Media 
 
4. Touch a star on the screen. 
 
 The leftmost star equates to a rating of one star and the rightmost 
equates to a rating of five stars.
 
5. Touch OK to confirm your rating or Cancel to back out without 
saving it.
After you’ve rated the software, a new item, Post a comment, appears in the 
My review section of the screen directly below My rating. By touching Post a 
comment, a text box appears where you can wax poetic about the highs and 
lows of this application. As with the rating, touch OK to confirm or Cancel to 
discard your comment.

The Part of Tens 

In this part . . .
T
hese days, Android is surrounded by a ton of atten-
tion and buzz — and with that buzz comes a whole 
bunch of accessories, applications, and miscellany as 
developers and manufacturers try to ride on the G1’s 
successful coattails. How’s a new G1 owner to separate 
the wheat from the chaff? Join me in Part V as I look 
at lists of my favorite applications, accessories, Android-
related Web sites, and games.

Ten Great Android Applications
In This Chapter

▶ Locale
▶ Caller ID by WhitePages
▶ Shazam
▶ Video Player
▶ Any Cut
▶ The Weather Channel
▶ OI Notepad
▶ Ringdroid
I
f you’ve taken a glance at Chapter 18, you’re probably well acquainted 
with the Android Market. There’s a problem, though: With hundreds of 
applications offered in the Market and more added every day, it can be nearly 
impossible to cut through the fat and figure out what’s worth downloading.
That’s a tough problem to solve — and no two people will love exactly the 
same Android applications — but I’ve boiled down the treasure trove of 
goodies offered by the Market to a list of ten must-try apps. Go ahead and 
live it up. The applications are free, after all, and if you decide an app isn’t for 
you, you can always uninstall it.
CompareEverywhere
It turns out that your ultimate shopping companion isn’t a pocketbook full of 
cash and plastic (although that certainly helps). With CompareEverywhere, 
just scan the UPC codes found on products you’re shopping for, and within a 

294
Part V: The Part of Tens 
few seconds, the app will tell you if another nearby store has a better price 
and what you’d pay if you were to mail order the same product from an 
online retailer. You’d be amazed by how much you can save.
TuneWiki
The G1’s built-in music player isn’t the most incredible music player I’ve ever 
used, and it probably isn’t the best you’ve ever used, either. It gets the job 
done, but better apps are out there to blast your tracks, and TuneWiki is one 
of them. With TuneWiki, you can see synchronized lyrics (think karaoke in 
your pocket) for many of the songs in your library, chat about tracks, artists, 
and playlists with other TuneWiki users, and even see the location of other 
users and what they’re listening to.
Locale
So-called location-based services (you may hear the acronym LBS thrown 
around from time to time) are all the rage on phones these days, and Locale 
is a perfect example of what makes them so incredible. The application 
allows you to automatically configure certain Android settings — your 
network setup, your ringtone, and even your Home screen wallpaper — 
depending on your location, remaining battery life, current date and time, 
and who’s calling. If you’re going to download just one application for your 
G1, this should be it!
Caller ID by WhitePages
One popular feature of the Apple iPhone is its ability to identify the city and 
state of incoming calls — a handy tool when a phone number is unfamiliar. 
CallerID by WhitePages brings that same functionality to Android and takes it 
a few steps further by automatically looking up incoming numbers in public 
records, displaying any names associated with them, and letting you know 
whether calls are coming from cellphones or landlines.
Shazam
What CompareEverywhere is to products on store shelves, Shazam is to the 
music you hear. This ultra-handy little app listens to tunes, identifies what 
they are, and gives you the opportunity to buy the tracks immediately. If you 

295
 Chapter 19: Ten Great Android Applications
just want to store track names for later, that’s cool too because Shazam 
keeps a list of every song it’s identified. It’s amazingly accurate.
Video Player
For some strange reason, Google didn’t bother to include a video player on 
the G1 beyond its own YouTube application. Don’t get me wrong; YouTube’s 
great. But sometimes you want to watch your own video, not what YouTube 
has to offer. For that, you’ll want one of the video player applications 
available in the Market, and the aptly named Video Player is about as simple 
and straightforward as they come. Just drop MPEG4 and 3GPP video files on 
your G1’s memory card, and Video Player will eat ’em up.
Any Cut
Out of the box, Android lets you add shortcuts to contacts, Gmail labels, 
music playlists, and Browser bookmarks right onto your Home screen. Any 
Cut goes one step further by adding support for Home screen shortcuts to 
direct calls and text messages as well. Translation: speed dial (and speed text 
message) right from your Home screen. Awesome.
The Weather Channel
What’s the single most important piece of information you want when you 
wake up in the morning? (And no, a cup of coffee doesn’t count as a “piece of 
information.”) I like to see the weather forecast for the day so I can plan what 
I’m wearing and figure out whether I need to lug around an umbrella. No 
shortage of weather applications are available for Android, but The Weather 
Channel is the slickest I’ve seen, with an easy-to-use tabbed interface and the 
ability to spit out the forecast for your current location automatically.
OI Notepad
You already know that Google forgot to include an all-purpose video player 
with the G1. You know what else they forgot? A note-taking app! OI Notepad 
is nothing more than an ultrabasic way to jot down quick notes — it’s not 
fancy, but it gets the job done.

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Ringdroid
The G1’s Music application lets you assign a track as your ringtone, but it 
assigns the whole darned song. Sometimes the beginning of a track isn’t the 
best part to turn into a ringtone. Ringdroid lets you cut small sections out of 
your stored music and use the snippets as ringtones. What’s more, you can 
record new ringtones using the G1’s microphone.

Ten Accessories for Your G1 
In This Chapter
▶ Bluetooth headset
▶ microSD card
▶ microSD to SD card adapter
▶ USB SD card reader
▶ Spare battery
▶ Screen protector
▶ ExtUSB to 3.5mm jack adapter
▶ Upgraded headphones or earphones
▶ Car charger
▶ Case
You didn’t think that your spending spree would end the moment you 
picked up your G1, did you? Like a pet, a car, or an expensive (but 
enjoyable) hobby, you can more or less spend as much money accessorizing 
your new handset as you please. In this chapter, I take you through a quick 
list of the things you might want to look at buying first.
Bluetooth Headset
In many states and municipalities, talking on a handset while driving is now a 
primary offense, meaning you can be pulled over for it and ticketed (and yes, 
your insurance rates might go up, too). Because of that, there’s never been a 
better time to invest in a Bluetooth headset that you can use to help you 
keep your hands on the wheel while you’re on the road.
Bluetooth headsets are wildly popular these days, so they are easy to find; 
are available in every shape, style, and color of the rainbow; and range in 
price from just a few dollars to several hundred. One of my favorite models 

298
Part V: The Part of Tens 
for style, noise resistance, and comfort on the ear is the Jawbone, available 
from www.jawbone.com for $129.99 at the time of this writing. However, you 
can get a perfectly good headset for much, much less by visiting any wireless 
store or your T-Mobile location.
microSD Card
I’ve mentioned a few times throughout the book that the 1GB microSD 
card included with the G1 isn’t enough to maximize the phone’s capabilities. 
To use the G1 as an effective music and photo player, you’ll want more 
memory. At Best Buy, amazon.com, and virtually any other retailer that sells 
electronics, you can find 16GB cards for well under $100 and 8GB cards for 
$20 or less! 
microSD-to-SD Card Adapter
The microSD standard is a miniaturized version of the SD standard, a popular 
memory card format used by a variety of devices including most consumer 
digital cameras and the Nintendo Wii. Being able to move your memory cards 
among all your devices is convenient, and a microSD-to-SD card adapter 
allows you to do that. These adapters look like SD cards and contain a slot on 
one end for inserting a microSD card. They’re sometimes included with 
microSD cards you buy, but if you don’t have one, your best bet is to get one 
bundled with a 512MB or 1GB microSD card for under $10.
USB SD Card Reader
Another benefit of having a microSD-to-SD card adapter handy is that when 
you add a USB SD card reader into the mix, you’ll be able to pull your 
memory card out of your G1, plug the card right into your PC, and read it 
(and write to it) without having to connect the G1 itself. These readers plug 
into an available USB port on your PC and have an SD slot on the other end; 
just plug in a card and you’re off to the races. A great place to find a wide 
selection of memory card readers, many of which sell for just $6 or $7, is 
www.newegg.com.
Spare Battery
The G1 is a powerful phone, and an ancient saying applies here: “With 
great power comes great power drain.” If you frequently have a laptop or 

299
 Chapter 20: Ten Accessories for Your G1
messenger bag with you, it’s not a bad idea to keep a charged, ready-to-go 
spare G1 battery in there in case you’ve been using the phone heavily and 
you’re at risk of not making it back to a charger in time. At the time of this 
writing, T-Mobile doesn’t sell spare G1 batteries, but I expect them to start 
doing so soon for between $40 and $50.
Screen Protector
All phone screens are at constant risk of nicks, cracks, and scratches, but 
the G1 is at even more risk than your average phone because you’re 
constantly touching and interacting with the screen. You can find a number 
of sources for phone and PDA screen protectors on the Internet. Fellowes 
(www.fellowes.com) produces the WriteRight series, which has been 
around for many years and has always served me well. Finding WriteRights or 
any other brand of screen protection presized for your G1 may be difficult, 
but they are available in a universal size that you can easily trim to fit the 
G1’s screen.
ExtUSB-to-3.5mm Jack Adapter
If you’re looking to use the G1 as a serious music player, one of the first 
things you need to do is ditch the included headphones. But to do that, you 
need an adapter that allows the phone to accept regular headphones that 
use a 3.5mm jack, and not all G1s include such an adapter. One of the nicest 
aftermarket adapters that I’ve seen is the 3-in-1 Adaptor from eXpansys 
(www.expansys-usa.com), retailing for about $13 and taking up as little 
room in your G1 (or in your bag) as possible.
Upgraded Headphones or Earphones
Now that you’ve nabbed that ExtUSB-to-3.5mm jack adapter, the next step 
is to get something to plug into it. You’ll have no problem finding decent 
headphones or earphones from any electronics retailer — and seriously, 
anything is better than what T-Mobile includes with the G1. However, 
if you’re serious about your sound, I recommend checking out Shure 
(www.shure.com) or Ultimate Ears (www.ultimateears.com). Their 
extremely high-quality earphones range in price from $100 up to a staggering 
$1150!

300
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Car Charger
If you’re doing any amount of driving, it’s handy to be able to use your car as 
a backup method of charging your G1. Fortunately, the G1 charges from a 
standard USB connector, so you can use any car charger that features a 
USB port. Just connect your USB cable to the charger, connect the G1 to the 
other end, and you’ll start the flow of much-needed juice to the battery. USB 
car chargers are relatively easy to find these days, and you should have no 
trouble coming across a few choices at your local Best Buy.
Case
As hardy as the G1’s shell might be, it will still get banged up over time if 
you’re using it heavily. (And with that great e-mail and Web access, why 
wouldn’t you be using it heavily?) A case can save you from the heartache of 
watching your beloved phone take the brunt of the abuse. You can find cases 
in all sorts of styles, everything from form-fitting cases that slip onto the 
shell without changing its shape to big leather pouches equipped with extra 
pockets and slots for accessories. T-Mobile has yet to offer any cases directly 
for the G1, but I suspect they will. If you’re in the market for an ultra high-
quality leather case, check out Vaja (www.vajacases.com), where you can 
choose from a variety of styles and colors.

o you’ve settled in with the G1, you’re taking advantage of the Market to 
get some cool apps installed, and you’re all set for accessories. Now, 
the next challenge is staying on top of things! Android is a young platform 
that’s changing rapidly and almost constantly; major new software versions 
will be made available and cool new handsets will be announced at a rapid 
clip. Fortunately, you can use a dedicated array of Web sites to stay one step 
ahead of all the Android news that’s fit to print, and I’ll take you through a 
few of my favorites in this chapter.
Official Android Site
www.android.com
What better way to kick off this list than with Android’s official home page on 
the Web? This is the place to read up on the latest news about Android. The 

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
site also features links to Android’s developer and Market communities, 
where you can read questions and answers from forum members and add 
your own comments into the mix.
T-Mobile Forums
forums.t-mobile.com
T-Mobile’s official forums have three active message boards dedicated to the 
G1 where you can go to find answers to problems users are having and lend 
a helping hand in solving others’ issues. Even better, T-Mobile staffs these 
forums with employees who occasionally chime in with an official word from 
the company, so this is definitely the place to go if you want your voice to be 
heard.
HTC T-Mobile G1 Support
www.htc.com
If you should ever lose the user’s manual that came with the G1, you can 
grab a digital copy from HTC’s own support site. To get here, go to HTC’s 
home page at www.htc.com, click the Support tab at the top of the page, 
and then click T-Mobile G1 in the list that appears. You’ll also find a list of 
frequently-asked questions (FAQs) maintained here.
Android Forums
androidforums.com
The independently run Android Forums site is not monitored (at least not 
officially, anyway) by any T-Mobile, HTC, or Google staff, but it is active and 
has a wider array of message boards available than T-Mobile’s own site. If 
you’re looking for help from your fellow players in beating a particular game, 
for example, Android Forums is a great place to start looking.
HowardForums
www.howardforums.com

303
 Chapter 21: Ten Great Sites for Android Information
Widely regarded as the one of the most active communities of phone users 
on the Internet, HowardForums isn’t just for G1 users — or even just Android 
users, for that matter. Instead, it’s a huge melting pot of folks from nearly 
every carrier across North America (and the globe) looking to chat about 
phones, phone technology, phone software, and everything in between. 
You’ll find HTC, T-Mobile, and Android message boards here, among many 
others.
Android Community
www.androidcommunity.com
Android Community is a comprehensive site for all things Android. The site 
consists of a newsy blog, a database of Android applications, and discussion 
forums. The blog is a good daily read to keep up on the latest goings-on in 
the world of Android and the G1.
AndroidGuys
www.androidguys.com
Like Android Community, AndroidGuys seeks to be your one-stop shop for 
Android information on the Web. It does a solid job with software reviews 
(which are going to become more and more important as the Market fills 
to the brim with a nearly endless list of available applications), and the 
editorials make for an entertaining read.
Phandroid
phandroid.com
Phandroid covers Android news and reviews in a blog format. I wouldn’t look 
to it as my primary source of news about the G1, but the site does a solid job 
of staying on top of interesting Android applications that might otherwise 
slip under the radar.

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Phone Scoop
www.phonescoop.com
In addition to covering mobile industry news, Phone Scoop is your encyclo-
pedic reference for virtually everything related to cellphones. Android 
is given equal time here along with every other platform — Windows 
Mobile, Symbian, and so on. And if you should ever need to know the screen 
resolution of a Nokia 3250, Phone Scoop is the first, last, and only place you 
should look.
Engadget Mobile
www.engadgetmobile.com
Of course, I’d be remiss if I didn’t plug the site that I write for. A dearly loved 
child of tech blog Engadget, Engadget Mobile covers everything in the mobile 
business with news, reviews, and editorials published 365 days a year. If you 
want to be the very first to hear about that new Android handset or the latest 
firmware update for your G1, Engadget Mobile is the place to go. (And if you 
just don’t want this book to ever end, take comfort in the fact that you can 
read me there nearly every day of the year.)

s far as entertainment goes, the YouTube application will hold you 
over for only so long before you have to give in and pick up some 
games. Actually, on second thought, maybe YouTube’s endless collection of 
bizarre and hilarious videos could be enough to entertain you forever. But 
trust me; it’s worth your time to explore the lighter side of the Android 
Market by downloading a few of these fantastic titles. 
PAC-MAN by Namco
Vintage video games are making a comeback, and no catalog of arcade 
classics would be complete without the timeless PAC-MAN. Namco’s version 
for Android is a faithful reproduction of the original, and three control 
modes make the game surprisingly easy to use.

306
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Bonsai Blast
If you’re looking to hone your thumb-eye coordination, Bonsai Blast is just 
the ticket. Shoot colored spheres into an ever-advancing line to form and 
destroy combinations before the line reaches the end! Tons of fun levels 
make Bonsai Blast playable for hours upon hours — just don’t be surprised 
if you end up with a sore thumb.
Texas Hold ’em
Is “all in” a way of life for you? Texas Hold ’em is one of the first games to 
show up for Android, which is no surprise given the popularity of the 
card game of the same name. The application looks great and works well. 
(I especially like the innovative betting mechanism — just rotate a chip to 
change the bet.) However, in its current incarnation, your only option is 
to play against a host of computer opponents. A multiplayer version would 
be even better!
Snake
If you used a Nokia phone at any point in the late 1990’s or the early part of 
the 2000’s, you already know what this game is all about! Snake is a remake of 
the Nokia classic, albeit on a slightly larger screen and with just a bit more 
color than those tiny monochrome screens of yore. The concept is to guide 
around the screen an ever-growing snake, which is eating fruits to get longer 
and move more quickly. If you crash into yourself or the wall, the game is 
over. Snake is a quick, simple game that you can easily fit into a spare five 
minutes here and there.
Coloroid
Coloroid is another simple but deceivingly difficult game. You’re presented 
with a board of colored squares, and your goal is to turn it all into a single 
color in as few moves as possible by making wise choices in expanding the 
selected area of the board. As your skill level improves, you can increase the 
number of squares on the board until you’re ready to pull out your hair!

307
 Chapter 22: Ten Must-Play Android Games
Light Racer
Remember the movie Tron with those crazy light cycles? You may also 
remember — and in doing so, you’ll be showing your age — that the movie 
was followed by a Midway arcade game where you raced those light cycles 
around the screen, trying to cut off your opponent and force him to crash. 
Light Racer is a remake of the Midway original, and it works really well — just 
get ready to be quick with the trackball.
Divide and Conquer!
Divide and Conquer! is another classic that you may have played in one of its 
many forms on a PC or video game console in years past. The idea is simple: 
You have some balls on the screen, and you must contain them in a small 
area by drawing lines. If a ball hits a wall while it’s still being constructed, 
you lose a life. It takes a steady hand and a watchful eye to make it past the 
first few levels.
MisMisMatch
If you are looking for an SAT-style mental workout, look no further than 
MisMisMatch. The game — which would actually qualify more as schoolwork 
to some, I think — takes you through a series of flashcards of colored shapes. 
Your goal is to find the series of three cards that are different in two ways. It’s 
harder than it sounds.
Parallel Kingdom
Parallel Kingdom isn’t great just yet, but it has the potential to become one of 
Android’s killer games if enough people start to use it. The game uses your 
actual location to add villains and items to the map of the area surrounding 
you in real life. The idea is not novel but it is the first time it has been made 
available in a device as high-profile as the G1. As people around you start to 
play the game, they are added to your map as well so that you can interact 
with them, which is where things could start to get interesting. Here’s hoping!

308
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Solitaire
In my opinion, no electronic device is complete until it has some form of 
Solitaire loaded, and the G1 is no exception. The version available in the 
Android Market works just like the ever-present time waster that you find in 
every version of Windows, but it also includes Spider and Freecell versions 
for endless one-player entertainment.
