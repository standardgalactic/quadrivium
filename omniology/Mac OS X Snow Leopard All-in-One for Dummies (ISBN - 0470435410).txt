About the Author
Mark L. Chambers has been an author, computer consultant, BBS sysop, 
programmer, and hardware technician for more than 25 years — pushing 
computers and their uses far beyond “normal” performance limits for 
decades now. His fi rst love affair with a computer peripheral blossomed in 
1984 when he bought his lightning-fast 300 BPS modem for his Atari 400. 
Now he spends entirely too much time on the Internet and drinks far too 
much caffeine-laden soda.
With a degree in journalism and creative writing from Louisiana State 
University, Mark took the logical career choice: programming computers. 
However, after fi ve years as a COBOL programmer for a hospital system, 
he decided there must be a better way to earn a living, and he became 
the Documentation Manager for Datastorm Technologies, a well-known 
communications software developer. Somewhere in between writing software 
manuals, Mark began writing computer how-to books. His fi rst book, Running 
a Perfect BBS, was published in 1994 — and after a short fi fteen years of fun 
(disguised as hard work), Mark is one of the most productive and best-selling 
technology authors on the planet.
Along with writing several books a year and editing whatever his publishers 
throw at him, Mark has also branched out into Web-based education, 
designing and teaching a number of online classes — called WebClinics — 
for Hewlett-Packard.
His favorite pastimes include collecting gargoyles, watching St. Louis 
Cardinals baseball, playing his three pinball machines and the latest computer 
games, supercharging computers, and rendering 3D fl ights of fancy with 
TrueSpace — and during all that, he listens to just about every type of 
music imaginable. Mark’s worldwide Internet radio station, MLC Radio (at 
www.mlcbooks.com), plays only CD-quality classics from 1970 to 1979, 
including everything from Rush to Billy Joel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Mark’s rapidly expanding list of books includes MacBook For Dummies, 
2nd Edition; Macs for Seniors For Dummies; iMac For Dummies, 5th Edition; 
Build Your Own PC Do-It-Yourself For Dummies; Building a PC For Dummies, 
5th Edition; Scanners For Dummies, 2nd Edition; CD & DVD Recording For 
Dummies, 2nd Edition; PCs All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, 4th Edition; 
Mac OS X Tiger: Top 100 Simpliﬁ ed Tips & Tricks; Microsoft Ofﬁ ce v. X Power 
User’s Guide; BURN IT! Creating Your Own Great DVDs and CDs; The Hewlett-
Packard Ofﬁ cial Printer Handbook; The Hewlett-Packard Ofﬁ cial Recordable 
CD Handbook; The Hewlett-Packard Ofﬁ cial Digital Photography Handbook; 
Computer Gamer’s Bible; Recordable CD Bible; Teach Yourself the iMac Visually; 
Running a Perfect BBS; Ofﬁ cial Netscape Guide to Web Animation; and Windows 
98 Troubleshooting and Optimizing Little Black Book.

His books have been translated into 15 different languages so far — his 
favorites are German, Polish, Dutch, and French. Although he can’t read 
them, he enjoys the pictures a great deal.
Mark welcomes all comments about his books. You can reach him at 
mark@mlcbooks.com, or visit MLC Books Online, his Web site, at

Dedication
This book is dedicated with love to Frank and Vera Judycki. They might have 
started out as my in-laws, but now they’re MawMaw and PawPaw.


Acknowledgments
Once again, the good folks at Wiley Publishing have made things easy on a 
demanding technology author! It’s time to send my appreciation to those 
who helped make this book a reality.
As with all my books, I’d like to fi rst thank my wife, Anne; and my children, 
Erin, Chelsea, and Rose; for their support and love — and for letting me 
follow my dream!
No project gets underway without the Composition Services team. Starting 
with my words and adding a tremendous amount of work, Composition 
Services has once again taken care of art, layout, and countless other steps 
that I can’t fathom. Thanks to each of the team members for a beautiful book.
Next, my appreciation goes to my superb technical editor Dennis Cohen, who 
checked the technical accuracy of every word — including that baker’s dozen 
of absurd acronyms that crops up in every technology book I’ve ever written. 
His work ensures that my work is the best it can be!
Finally, I come to my hardworking project editor, Susan Christophersen — 
whom I was lucky enough to work with for the fi rst time on this project — 
and my top-of-the-line acquisitions editor (and good friend) Bob Woerner! My 
heartfelt thanks to both of them, for without their support at every step, this 
book wouldn’t have been possible. With their help, yet another For Dummies 
title was guided safely into port!

Introduction
E
legant.
I remember the first moment I moved a mouse across a Mac OS X Desktop. 
At that time, it was the beta of version 10.0 — and I very well remember the 
word elegant as my first impression. (My second impression was UNIX done 
better.)
That’s really saying something, because I’m an old operating system cur-
mudgeon: I cut my computing teeth on Atari, Commodore 64, and TRS-80 
Model III machines, and I still feel much at home in the character-based 
environment of DOS and UNIX. Of course, I’ve also used every version of 
Windows that His Gatesness has produced, including the much-improved 
Windows XP and the somewhat-improved Windows Vista. And yes, I’ve 
used Mac OS since before the days of System 7, using a Macintosh SE with a 
9-inch monitor (and a built-in handle).
But out of this host of operating systems, could you really call one elegant 
before now? (Even Mac OS 9 didn’t deserve such a description, although it 
did provide the foundation of convenience and simplicity.) Mac OS X — now 
at version 10.6, affectionately called Snow Leopard — is something different: 
It’s a fine-cut diamond amongst a handful of semi-precious stones. It’s the 
result of an unnatural marriage, I’ll admit . . . the intuitive, graphical world of 
Mac OS 9 paired with the character-based stability and efficient multitasking 
of UNIX. Who would have thought that they would work together so well? 
Mac OS X performs like a Ferrari, and (unbelievably) it looks as good, too.
Therefore, you can imagine just how excited I was to be asked by my friends 
at Wiley to write this book and how I immediately jumped at the chance to 
write a comprehensive guide to Apple’s masterpiece. The book that you 
hold in your hands uses the classic For Dummies design; it provides you 
with the step-by-step instruction (plenty of which my editors grudgingly 
agree is somewhat humorous) on every major feature of Mac OS X. It also 
goes a step further from time to time, delving into why something works the 
way that it does or what’s going on behind the scenes. You can chalk that 
up to my sincere admiration for everyone in Cupertino and what they’ve 
perfected.
What you won’t find in this All-in-One is wasted space. All the new features 
of version 10.6 are here, including improvements to Apple Mail, Safari, the

latest versions of all the “iApps ’09” (including iWeb), and the new incarna-
tion of iWork ’09. Everything’s explained from the ground up, just in case 
you’ve never touched an Apple computer before. By the time you reach 
the final pages, you’ll have covered advanced topics, such as networking, 
AppleScript, Internet security . . . and yes, even an introduction to the 
powerful world of UNIX that exists underneath.
I sincerely hope that you’ll enjoy this book and that it will act as your guide 
while you discover all the wonderful features of Mac OS X Snow Leopard 
that I use every day. Remember, if a Windows-enslaved acquaintance still tit-
ters about your iMac, I’ll understand if you’re tempted to drop this weighty 
tome on his foot. (Of course, if you’re using an Intel-based Mac, you can also 
boot into Windows and watch him turn purple.)
 
The official name of the latest version is (portentous pause here, please) 
Mac OS X version 10.6 Snow Leopard. But who wants to spit out that mouth-
ful every time? Throughout this book, I refer to the operating system as Mac 
OS X, and when I discuss something that’s particular to the latest version, I 
call it Snow Leopard.
What’s Really Required
If you have a Mac that’s either running Mac OS X version 10.6 (Snow 
Leopard) or is ready to be upgraded to it, you’re set to go. Despite what you 
might have heard, you won’t require any of the following:
 
✦ A degree in computer science: Apple designed Mac OS X for regular 
people, and I designed this book for people of every experience level. 
Even if you’ve never used a Mac before, you’ll find no hostile waters here.
 
✦ A fortune in software: I do describe additional software that you can 
buy to expand the functionality of your Mac; however, that section is 
only a few pages long. Everything else covered in this book is included 
with Mac OS X Snow Leopard — and by the size of this volume, you get a 
rough idea of just how complete Mac OS X is! Heck, many folks buy Macs 
just because of the free software you get, such as iMovie and iPhoto. 
(Tough cookies to the vast Unwashed Windows Horde.)
 
✦ An Internet connection: Granted, you’re not going to do much with 
Apple Mail without an Internet connection, but computers did exist 
before the Internet. You can still be productive with Mac OS X without 
receiving buckets of spam.
Oh, you will need a set of Mac OS X version 10.6 installation discs, unless 
Snow Leopard came pre-installed on your Mac. Go figure.

About This Book
Although this book is an All-in-One, you can also read it in a linear fashion 
(straight through) — probably not in one session, mind you. (Then again, 
Diet Coke is cheap, so it is possible.) The material is divided into eight 
minibooks, each of which covers an entire area of Mac OS X knowledge. For 
example, you’ll find minibooks on networking, the Apple Digital Hub suite of 
applications known as iLife, Apple’s iWork office productivity suite, custom-
izing your Desktop, and Internet-related applications.
Each self-contained chapter discusses a specific feature, application, connec-
tion, or cool thing about Mac OS X. Feel free to begin reading anywhere or 
skip chapters at will. For example, if you’re already using an Internet connec-
tion, you won’t need the chapter on adding an Internet connection. However, 
I recommend that you read this book from the front to the back, as you do 
any good mystery novel. (Watch out; oncoming spoiler: For those who want 
to know right now, Bill Gates did it.)
Conventions Used in This Book
Even For Dummies books have to get technical from time to time, usually 
involving commands that you have to type and menu items that you have to 
click. If you’ve read any of my other For Dummies books, you’ll know that a 
helpful set of conventions is used to indicate what needs to be done or what 
you see on-screen.
Stuff you type
When I ask you to type a command or enter something in a text field (such 
as your name or phone number), the text appears like this: Type me.
Press the Return key to process the command or enter the text.
Menu commands
When I give you a specific set of menu commands to use, they appear in the 
following format: Edit➪Copy.
In this example, you should click the Edit menu and then choose the Copy 
menu item.

In case you’re curious about computers
No one expects a book in the For Dummies series to contain techno-jargon 
or ridiculous computer science semantics — especially a book about the 
Macintosh! Apple has always strived for simplicity and user friendliness. 
I hereby promise that I’ve done my absolute best to avoid unnecessary 
techno-talk. For those who are interested in what’s happening under the 
hood, I provide sidebars that explain a little more about what’s doing what 
to whom. If you’d rather just have fun and ignore the digital dirty work, 
please feel free to disregard these additions (but don’t tear sidebars out of 
the book, because there’s likely to be important stuff on the opposite side of 
the page).
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve done my best to emulate the elegant design of Mac OS X by organizing 
this book into eight minibooks, with cross-references where appropriate.
Book I: Introducing Mac OS X
This minibook begins with an invigorating chapter explaining exactly why 
you should be so happy to be a Mac OS X owner. Then I provide an intro-
duction to the basic tasks that you’ll perform — copying files, running pro-
grams, and the like. You’ll also find coverage of Snow Leopard’s Spotlight 
search engine, a guide to normal Mac OS X maintenance and troubleshoot-
ing, and instructions on using the Mac OS X Help system.
Book II: Customizing and Sharing
Who wants to stick with the defaults? The material in this minibook leads 
you through the steps that you need to customize Mac OS X to your specific 
needs and desires . . . everything from a tweak to your background or screen 
saver to a description of how to set up and administer multiple accounts on 
a single Macintosh. You’ll also find coverage of the different settings you can 
change in System Preferences, which is an important place in Mac OS X.
Book III: The Digital Hub
Sweet! This minibook jumps right in among the crown jewels of the Digital 
Hub: iTunes, iPhoto, iDVD, iMovie, iWeb, GarageBand, QuickTime Player,

and the DVD Player. Taken as a suite, those first six applications make up 
iLife ’09, and they allow you to plug in and use all sorts of electronic gadgets, 
including digital cameras, digital video (DV) camcorders, and MP3 players. 
Plus, you can edit or create your own DVDs, audio CDs, and movies.
Book IV: Using iWork
iWork ’09 is rapidly becoming the favorite office productivity suite among 
the Apple Faithful. You’ll find a chapter devoted to each application: Pages 
for desktop publishing, Numbers for spreadsheets, and Keynote for presen-
tation projects. Who needs that other productivity suite? (I forget the name.)
Book V: The Typical Internet Stuff
This minibook contains just what it says. But then again, it’s easy to get 
enthusiastic about Apple Mail, the latest version of Apple’s instant messag-
ing application (iChat), and the online storage provided by iDisk. I also cover 
Safari, Apple’s hot-rod Web browser. Finally, you discover more about the 
built-in Internet firewall and how you can use it to safeguard your Mac from 
Internet undesirables.
Book VI: Networking in Mac OS X
Ethernet, Bluetooth, and Bonjour are lurking in this minibook. I explain them 
step-by-step, in language that a normal human being can understand. Find 
out how to use wireless networks such as AirPort Extreme from Apple as 
well as how to share an Internet connection with other computers in a local 
network.
Book VII: Expanding Your System
Time to take things up a notch. In this minibook, I discuss the hardware 
and software that everyone’s adding to Mac OS X and why you might (or 
might not) need such toys. Memory (RAM), hard drives, printers, USB, and 
FireWire 800 . . . they’re all discussed here in detail. Consider this a banquet 
of expansion information.
Book VIII: Advanced Mac OS X
I know that I told you earlier that I was going to avoid techno-talk when-
ever possible, yet I also mentioned the advanced things that you find in 
this minibook, such as using UNIX within Mac OS X and using Automator to 
build your own custom script applications that handle repetitious tasks. If 
you don’t mind immersing yourself in all that’s technical, read here for the 
skinny on hosting a Web site and communicating with Mac OS X by using 
your voice and your handwriting.

Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book are more than just attractive — they’re also impor-
tant visual cues for stuff that you don’t want to miss.
 
Mark’s Maxims represent way-important stuff, so I call your attention to 
these nuggets in bold, like this:
Something Really Important Is Being Said that will likely affect your 
person in the near future. Pay attention, commit those Maxims to memory, 
and you’ll avoid the pitfalls that the rest of us have hit on the way.
 
The Tip icons flag short snippets of information that will save you time or 
trouble (and, in some cases, even cash).
 
These icons highlight optional technical information for folks like me. If you 
also used to disassemble alarm clocks for fun when you were six years old, 
you’ll love this stuff.
 
Always read this information next to this icon first! Something looms ahead 
that could put your hardware or software at risk.
 
Look to the Remember icons for those tidbits that you need to file away in 
your mind. Just remember to remember.

t’s human nature to require instant gratification from your software. 
I’ve seen it countless times: Someone runs a program, immediately feels 
comfortable with it, and then spends the rest of his days using that program 
religiously. Or another person plays with the same program for 120 seconds 
and dismisses it as too difficult or too confusing. It’s rather like watching 
a fancy fashion show runway in Rome or Paris: There had better be eye 
appeal pretty quickly or the bucks won’t flow.
Ditto for modern computer operating systems. An operating system is the 
basic software that determines the look and feel of your entire computer 
and usually extends to the programs that you run as well. Microsoft felt the 
pinch of an old-fashioned operating system when Windows 98 and Windows 
Me were starting to appear rather plain looking. Then came Windows XP, 
where menus fade in and out like fireflies on a summer night, little pup-
pies help you find files, and other animation abounds. With the arrival of 
Windows Vista, Microsoft has attempted to match some of the elegance and 
power of Mac OS X in the PC world . . . but to be honest, updating a PC by 
upgrading to Windows Vista is a little like putting on a polyester sports coat 
over the same tired old leisure suit — most of what changes is on the out-
side. (And from what I’ve seen so far, Windows 7 is more of the same.)
Apple doesn’t work that way. Sure, Mac OS X looks doggone good. Forget 
the minimum requirement of shirt and shoes because this operating system 
is wearing an Armani suit. What’s really exciting for Macintosh owners 
around the world, however, is the heart that beats beneath the pretty form. 
At its introduction, Mac OS X was quite literally an operating system revolu-
tion, and it still delivers some of the most advanced features available on 
any personal computer in use today while remaining as easy to use as the 
first Macintosh. (And yes, I do own, use, and enjoy both PCs and Macs — 
what’s important to me is which computer does the best job the fastest in 
the easiest manner.)

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?

Now, I’m not going to just haul off and proclaim that Mac OS X can run rings 
around — well . . . you know, the W word — without solid proof. In this chap-
ter, I introduce you to the advantages of Mac OS X and why it’s such a step 
ahead for those running Windows. I also cover the hardware requirements 
for running Mac OS X version 10.6 (Snow Leopard) as well as guidelines on 
switching from Windows. Finally, I familiarize you with the steps that you’ll 
encounter the first time you fire up the Big X.
Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
Apple was one of the first to pioneer the graphical approach to computing 
with the appearance of the first Macintosh, so you’d expect Mac OS X to be 
simple to use — and indeed it is. For many folks, that’s Job One. If you’re one 
of those people, you can happily skip this section without need of further 
evidence because Mac OS X is undoubtedly the easiest operating system on 
the planet to use. (And believe me, I’m not knocking simplicity. Computers 
are supposed to be getting easier to use, and techno-nerds like me are sup-
posed to be rendered unnecessary as computers advance.) Here is the 
mantra of the Mac — and the first of Mark’s Maxims for this volume:
 
Make it easy.
Still with me? Need more testimony? Or perhaps you’re just curious about 
the engine under the hood. Then read on — and if you’re a Macintosh owner, 
feel free to gloat! (If you’re a PC owner, there’s always eBay.)
Pretty to behold
Let me illustrate with a screenshot or two. Figure 1-1 illustrates a typical 
screen from a day spent in Mac OS v. 9.2, the capable — albeit rather old-
fashioned — version of the Mac OS operating system that shipped in the 
days before Mac OS X.
Compare that screen with a similar screen from the latest version of the Big 
X, as shown in Figure 1-2. As you can see, everything’s streamlined in appear-
ance, with maximum efficiency in mind. Tasteful 3-D abounds, from the drop-
shadowed windows to the liquid-look scroll bars. Icons look like miniature 
works of art. Macintosh owners appreciate outstanding design — and can 
recognize the value of a great computer, even if it’s lime green (or looks like 
a white picture frame). After all, many Mac owners are professionals in the 
graphic arts, and Apple provides the hardware that they need — like the top-of-
the-line, liquid crystal display (LCD) used with the 24-inch flat-panel Intel iMac 
or the killer performance of the latest Mac Pro with quad-core processors.
Take a look at what’s going on behind the curtain — the Great Oz is actually 
pretty busy back there.

The allure of Aqua
The Apple software developers who introduced us to Mac OS X designed 
this “liquid” look from the ground up. They call it Aqua, and it’s Snow 
Leopard’s standard user interface.
Whoops, I just realized that I slipped a ten-cent example of techno-babble 
into that previous paragraph. Let me explain: A user interface design deter-
mines how things look throughout both the operating system itself and all 
applications that are written to run under an operating system (OS). This 
includes the buttons that you push, the controls that you click or move, and 
even the appearance of the windows and menus themselves. For example, if 
you’ve already begun to use Mac OS X, you’ve probably stopped right in the 
middle of a task and exclaimed to yourself, “Why, Self, look at that cool 3-D 
contour effect on that menu bar!” That shapely contour is a tiny part of the 
Aqua user interface design.
Aqua also extends to the placement of controls and how they’re shown to 
you. For example:
 
✦ Mac OS X uses Aqua sheets (which are attached to their parent win-
dows) to prompt you for input, such as confirming when you’re about 
to close a document without saving it. In contrast to Windows, multiple 
programs can have multiple sheets open, so you can continue to work 
in other applications without being rudely forced to answer the query 
immediately.
 
✦ Aqua’s file selection controls, such as the one in Figure 1-3, make it 
much easier to navigate quickly to a specific file or folder from within an 
application.
 
Figure 1-3: 
A typical file 
selection 
dialog (done 
right in 
Aqua).

✦ The Dock is another Aqua favorite. The Dock launches your favorite 
applications, indicates what’s running on your Mac, and allows you to 
switch between those programs — and all in a strip that you can relo-
cate and customize at will. I talk about the Dock in greater detail in Book 
II, Chapter 2.
 
Consider Aqua as the look-and-feel of Mac OS X and virtually all applications 
that it runs; you can discover how to use these Aqua controls in the pages 
to come. Of course, Mac owners really don’t have to worry about Aqua itself; 
the Aqua guidelines are a road map for those writing applications for Mac OS 
X. Programs written to the common Aqua interface standard will be easier 
for you to use, and you’ll become a proficient power user of that program 
much faster.
The quality of Quartz
The second ingredient in the visual feast that is Mac OS X is Quartz Extreme — 
again, I must ask your forgiveness, good reader, because I have to get a tad 
technical again. Quartz Extreme is a graphics engine: It’s the portion of Mac 
OS X that draws what you see on the screen (in the Aqua interface, natch). 
Think of the engine in your car, which is responsible for making your car move. 
Whether your Mac is running Microsoft Word or simply idling at the Desktop 
waiting for you to finish your soda, Quartz Extreme is at work displaying 
icons, drawing shapes, exhibiting the Finder, and animating things in the Dock.
What sets Quartz Extreme apart from the ho-hum graphics engine that 
Windows uses? It’s all about international programming standards . . . you 
know, those things that Microsoft would much rather you forget. To wit:
 
✦ PDF: The Quartz Extreme engine is built around the Acrobat Portable 
Document Format (PDF for short) developed by Adobe. If you’ve been 
spending any time at all on the Internet in the last ten or so years, you 
know that PDF files have emerged as the standard for displaying and 
printing the highest-quality electronic documents. Plus, Adobe has 
released a version of the free Acrobat Reader (www.adobe.com) for 
just about every computer on this green Earth. This means that text and 
graphics displayed in Quartz Extreme are razor sharp, resizable, and 
easily portable from one computer to another. In fact, Mac OS X displays 
PDF files without even requiring Acrobat, using the built-in Preview 
application. Figure 1-4 shows a complex PDF document that I opened in 
Mac OS X.

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?

Figure 1-4: 
Yep, that’s 
a PDF 
document, 
not a 
scanned 
image!
 
 
✦ OpenGL: Gamers will get really excited about this one: Quartz Extreme 
also uses the OpenGL graphics acceleration standard, which delivers 
the fastest 3-D graphics on the planet. (Think photo-realistic, high-
resolution graphics drawn in the blink of an eye.) In fact — and this is a 
really cool trick — OpenGL is even used to produce the Desktop in Mac 
OS X Snow Leopard.
 
 In English, that means that today’s top-of-the-line, 3-D gaming and 3-D 
graphics acceleration can take care of drawing everything; forget about 
waiting for windows to close or menus to appear, even when you’re cre-
ating the world’s biggest honking spreadsheet or building a presentation 
the size of Baltimore. As the Chairman of the Board would say, “We’re 
talkin’ fast, baby, like a rocket ship to the moon!”
 
✦ Core Animation: Snow Leopard includes functionality that Apple calls 
Core Animation, which makes it much easier for programmers to ani-
mate backgrounds and objects within their programs. Text, 3-D anima-
tion, and video now work seamlessly side-by-side, and eye-catching 
animations within applications, such as Time Machine, are the norm for 
Mac owners.
Stable, stable, stable
“So it’s elegant in design. That’s great, Mark, but what if Mac OS X crashes? 
Aqua and Quartz Extreme aren’t worth a plug nickel if my mouse doesn’t

move and I lose my document!” Believe me, I couldn’t agree more; I make my 
living from computers, and every time that a misbehaving program locks up 
one of my machines, I throw a tantrum that would make Godzilla back off. 
Lockups shouldn’t be tolerated in this day and age.
Luckily, the folks who designed Mac OS X were just as interested in produc-
ing a rock-solid operating system as they were in designing an attractive 
look. (Think of Tom Cruise’s face on The Rock’s body.)
Mac OS X is as hard to crash as the legendary UNIX operating system — 
that’s right, the same reliable workhorse that techno-wizards around the 
world use to power the Internet, where stability is all-important. In fact, Mac 
OS X is actually built on top of a UNIX base. It’s just well hidden underneath, 
allowing you and me to focus on our programs and click with a mouse with-
out knowing any of those obscure, arcane keyboard commands. You get the 
benefits of UNIX without a pair of suspenders, a pocket protector, or the 
hassle of growing a beard. (Not to mention years of computer programming 
experience.)
Apple calls this UNIX foundation at the heart of Mac OS X by another 
nifty title: Darwin. I could tell you that Darwin provides the latest in 64-bit 
memory support and CPU management, but if you’re a normal human being, 
your eyes will glaze over. Suffice it to say that Darwin makes the best use of 
your computer’s memory (RAM) and your computer’s brain (CPU) — Snow 
Leopard has been fine-tuned for processors with multiple cores, such as the 
Core 2 Duo CPU from Intel. Rest assured that your Web server will stay up 
even if your misbehaving Virtual Birdcalling simulation decides to run amok. 
(Emus running amok . . . how dreadful.)
If you’ve recorded or edited digital video (DV), 
you’re probably already familiar with Apple’s 
QuickTime MOV format. QuickTime movies are 
typically high resolution, relatively small , and 
easily created with iMovie, which I discuss in 
Book III, Chapter 4. Although QuickTime X isn’t 
“on stage” all the time, as is Aqua or Quartz 
Extreme, it’s still an important part of Mac OS X: 
Every time you display a video clip that you’ve 
recorded or watch a streaming TV broadcast 
from a Web site, you use QuickTime X. (Note, 
however, that you don’t use QuickTime X to 
watch DVD movies — that job is reserved for 
the Apple DVD Player.) QuickTime X includes 
support for AVC (Advanced Video Coding) for 
the best possible display of the latest HD (High 
Definition) video signals from the expensive 
hardware that’s now appearing at your local 
electronics Maze o’ Wires chain store.
QuickTime is actually not a new Mac OS X 
feature — it’s been around since the early 
1990s — but the latest versions of Mac OS X 
include the free QuickTime Player, which 
provides support for the latest broadcast and 
Web video. In fact, you can set up your own TV 
station on the Web with the tools included in 
the Professional QuickTime package.
Don’t forget QuickTime X!

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?

Yes, yet another standard is at work here — uh-oh, Overlord Gates is truly 
angry now! For those who do have a beard and are curious about such 
things, Darwin uses a FreeBSD kernel, so it also inherits all the protocol stan-
dards that have made UNIX the foundation of today’s Internet. You can find 
more about FreeBSD at www.freebsd.org. Because Mac OS X is developed 
as an open source project, software engineers outside Apple can actually 
contribute ideas and code, just as UNIX continues to evolve over time. (And 
yes, you’ll even discover how to access the powerful UNIX command prompt 
from Mac OS X in Book VIII, Chapter 1!)
To get an idea of just how well armored Mac OS X is, consider Figure 1-5. See 
how one program, which I call Titanic 1.0, has locked up like San Quentin. 
Under Mac OS 9 and older versions of Windows, your only chance at recov-
ering anything would involve divine intervention. However, in Mac OS X, my 
Pages application is unaffected because it has a completely protected area 
of system memory to play in. (I show you how to force a misbehaving appli-
cation to go away in Book I, Chapter 3.)

Multitasking and multithreading 
for normal human beings
And now, for your entertainment, a short one-act play. (Yes, really.)
A Shakespearean Moment of Multitasking and Multithreading
Our play opens with Julius Caesar shaking his head in disgust at his Mac OS 
9 Desktop.

Caesar: Anon, I am only one mortal, yet my Desktop doth abound with 
portals to applications of all different mien. Tell me, foul beast, why thy 
spirit seems slow and sluggish, and my Excel spreadsheet doth crawl on 
its belly!
[Enter Romeo, a cocky and rather brash young Apple software developer.]
Romeo: Dude, the problem is, like, your operating system. Y’see, older 
versions of both Mac OS and Windows ended up constantly, like, shifting 
your computer’s attention from one app to another — Excel has to coop-
erate with everything else that’s running in the background, like a good 
little corporate boy. It’s less efficient and very, very ’90s. Upgrade to 
Mac OS X, and you get preemptive multitasking — the app you’re actually 
using, like, gets the lion’s share of the processing time, and everything 
runs smoother when you need it. That’s the way UNIX works.
Caesar: Verily, your strange tongue doth annoy me. Guards, behead 
him — then obtain for me this Mac OS X.
Romeo: I’m outta here — I’ve got a hot date — but don’t forget, like, Mac 
OS X also uses multithreaded processing, so your Mac can handle differ-
ent operating system tasks at the same time. It’s kind of like your com-
puter can both walk and chew gum at the same time: fast, fast, fast!
[Exit Romeo — rather swiftly — stage right.]

When the play closes, we can only hope that Romeo is fast as well. (I told 
you it was a short play.)
The definition of Internet savvy
Remember the classic iMac advertisements that touted the one-plug 
approach to the Internet? That entire campaign was centered on one idea: 
that the Internet was supposed to be easy to use. The folks at Microsoft sat 
up and took notice when the iMac proved so incredibly successful, and 
Windows Vista actually reduced some of the overwhelming folderol that you 
had to encounter just to connect to the Internet — but Mac OS X still wipes 
the floor with Vista when it comes to easy and complete Internet connectiv-
ity. For example:
 
✦ Easy configuration: Mac OS X sets up your entire Internet connection 
with a simple wizard of four screens. As long as you’ve got the right 
information handy (which your Internet service provider [ISP] should 
supply), it’s a snap to set up.

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
18
 
✦ iDisk: What if I told you that for a reasonable yearly subscription fee, 
Apple can provide you with a chunk of Internet-accessible, private hard 
drive space — and that you can access this hard drive space from any-
where on Earth with an Internet connection? Absolutely, unbelievably, 
massively cool. This neat trick is called iDisk, and I cover it in detail in 
Book V, Chapter 4.
 
✦ All the Internet behind-the-scenes stuff: The Internet is basically built 
on a number of protocols (read that as rules for exchanging all sorts of 
data) — and, as I mention earlier, UNIX machines dominate the Internet. 
Ergo, Mac OS X on your Macintosh also provides you with support for 
just about every Internet protocol on the planet. Even if you don’t know 
them by name or write your own software, the applications that you buy 
can use them.
 
✦ A gaggle of great Internet applications: Mac OS X ships with all sorts 
of Internet magic built in. For example, you’ll get instant Internet and 
local network communication with iChat AV (which I cover in Book V, 
Chapter 3), Safari (covered in Book V, Chapter 5), and Apple Mail, a 
standard-issue, battle-ready e-mail program (which I discuss in Book V, 
Chapter 2). Yup, it’s all free.
 
✦ And Apache, sweet Apache: Friends, as a Webmaster myself, I can tell 
you that I was visibly moved — well, at least exceptionally excited — 
when I discovered that Mac OS X included the industry-standard Apache 
Web server, which runs over half of the sites on the Web! (Yep, that 
includes www.apple.com.) Get all the details in Book VIII, Chapter 4.
Lots of free goodies
You don’t just get Internet applications when you latch your fingers onto a 
box o’ Mac OS X — you can start doing all sorts of neat stuff without invest-
ing one extra dollar in more software!
Remember, what you receive along with Mac OS X depends on whether 
you’re buying a boxed copy, upgrading from an older version of Mac OS, or 
receiving the Big X already installed on a new Macintosh. With that in mind, 
check out the possibilities.
 
✦ This is the iLife: This suite of easy-to-use integrated programs is 
included with a new Mac, and it’s practically as well known as the com-
puter itself these days: iDVD, iPhoto, iTunes, GarageBand, iMovie, and 
iWeb. Each of these stellar programs is covered in full in Book III. If 
you’ve got a digital camera, an MP3 player, a USB musical keyboard, or a 
DV camcorder, you’ll be a very happy individual. I promise.
 
✦ iWork to the rescue: If you’ve bought a new Macintosh with Mac OS X 
pre-installed, you’ve also received a test drive version of iWork (Apple’s 
answer to Microsoft Office). Good stuff, indeed. If you don’t want to 
spend the bucks on Office 2008, and you don’t need the complex

gewgaws and baroque architecture of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, 
I can guarantee you that Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are powerful 
enough to satisfy your office document and presentation yearnings.
 
✦ The obligatory games: Apple typically chooses new games to bundle 
with Macs every three or four months — typically, games are selected 
that show off your Mac’s 3-D power, as well as finger-exercising arcade 
challenges. Because this book isn’t a game guide, I leave you to explore 
these games at your leisure.
What Do I Really Need to Run the Big X?
I’ve written nine other For Dummies books — I know, it’s getting to be a habit 
(and a career) — and I always find the “Hardware Requirements” section 
a hard one to write. Why? Well, I know what Apple claims as the minimum 
hardware requirements necessary to run Mac OS X. But, on the other hand, 
I know what I would consider the minimum hardware requirements, and 
they’re substantially different. Oh, well, let me list the bare bones and then 
I’ll give you my take on what you really need. (Naturally, if Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard is pre-installed on your computer, feel free to tear out this page and 
create a handful of celebratory confetti.)
From The World According to Jobs, the minimum requirements are as follows:
 
✦ Hardware: You’ll need any Mac with a Intel processor. This means that 
just about any recent desktop or laptop Mac is technically eligible to 
play (although you might find the performance of a first-generation Mac 
mini running Snow Leopard to be unacceptable). I should also mention 
that Mac OS X doesn’t support most third-party CPU upgrade cards 
out of the box. Again, note that you’ll need a DVD drive to install Snow 
Leopard (although it can be installed on the MacBook Air using the 
remote DVD feature).
 
✦ RAM: You’ll need at least 1GB of memory (RAM). At today’s low prices, 
that’s like buying a pizza.
 
✦ Hard drive territory: Although svelte by Windows standards, Mac OS X 
still needs about 8GB of free space on your hard drive.
From The World According to Chambers, the minimum requirements are
 
✦ Hardware: I recommend a Mac with at least an Intel Core 2 Duo proces-
sor. Remember, this is my take on what you’ll need to really take advan-
tage of Mac OS X Snow Leopard, and again, I have to say that I don’t 
think it performs well enough on Intel single-core computers.
 
✦ RAM: Don’t settle for anything less than 4GB. Again, with memory as 
cheap as it is these days, this is like adding extra cheese to that pizza.
 
 Time for a Mark’s Maxim:

Upgrading from Earlier Versions of Mac OS
20
 
Any techno-nerd worth the title will tell you that the single most important 
key to performance in today’s operating systems is RAM — yep, it’s actually 
more effective than a faster processor!
 
 If you’ve got any extra spending cash in between your sofa cushions, 
spend it on RAM. (Up to an Earth-shaking 32GB of RAM on the latest Mac 
Pro racehorses!)
 
✦ Hard drive territory: I’d recommend having
 
• 10GB free for just the operating system
 
• A minimum of an additional 40 to 60GB for any digital video clips, 
photographs, and songs you’ll be collecting
Upgrading from Earlier Versions of Mac OS
Because the installation of Mac OS is as simple as loading a DVD and double-
clicking an icon, there’s not much to tell. What’s important is the steps that 
you should take care of before you start the installation. I cover those in the 
next section. Pay heed, or pay later. I won’t go into detail about the actual 
installation because there really aren’t any details to speak of — you’ll 
answer a question or two and then hop up to get another cup of coffee or 
another caffeine-laden soda while the installer does the rest. Would anyone 
expect any different from Apple?
Back up — PLEASE back up
I know you’re anxious to join the In crowd, and Apple makes the upgrade 
process as noninvasive and as safe as possible, but SNAFUs such as power 
loss and hard drive failures do happen. With a full backup of your system on 
CD or DVD (or to an external hard drive using Time Machine), you can rest 
assured that you’ll get your precious files and folders back in pristine shape 
if tragedy strikes. To be honest, you need to back up your system on a regu-
lar basis anyway. Promise me now that you’ll back up your system, won’t 
you?
Snuff out disk errors
Before you upgrade, I recommend that you check that hard drive for errors 
one last time — upgrading a disk with directory errors takes longer. If you’re 
upgrading from an older version of Mac OS X, use Disk Utility, which I cover 
in Book I, Chapter 7. Ain’t technology grand?

Plug it, road warrior
You’re on the road with your MacBook Pro, and you’ve just bought your 
copy of Mac OS X Snow Leopard. You’re thinking of installing your brand-
spanking-new operating system. . . . Stop! NOW.
 
Before you decide to upgrade your Mac notebook, consider what will 
happen if that magical vessel containing all your files should flicker 
and . . . No, on second thought, don’t even visualize it. (Even if the battery 
is fully charged.) If you’re installing a Mac OS X upgrade on a MacBook, 
MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro, make sure that it’s plugged in and receiving 
its share of good, clean AC power from a handy, nearby wall socket. The 
installation process could take an hour, and there’ll be constant hard drive 
and DVD drive activity — think “Attack of the Energy-Draining Installation 
from Planet Lithium.” You don’t want to try this while your notebook is 
operating on battery power.
 
What’s that, you say? You’d like a comprehensive guide to your classy new 
Apple MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro laptop? Look no farther than 
the second edition of my bestselling MacBook For Dummies, published in 
both print and electronic book format by the good folks at Wiley. . . . With 
a copy in hand, any road warrior will find the answers to those Persistent 
Laptop Questions!
Heck, a techno-purist would probably recommend that you attach your 
Macintosh to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for the installation pro-
cess, but I’m not quite that paranoid about power outages.
 
Keep one thing in mind while installing Mac OS X: If you format the destination 
drive (the drive where you’ll install Mac OS X) you’ll lose everything that it 
stored. No big surprise there, and the installation program will warn you pro-
fusely about this beforehand. There’s really no reason to do so unless you just 
crave a clean installation (an installation of a new operating system on a newly 
formatted drive, compared with an upgrade of your existing Mac OS System 
files). Oh, and don’t forget to use Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format.
Pet peeve number 1 . . .
The round object that you load into your 
CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive is a disc, not a disk, 
like your hard drive or that flimsy floppy that 
some of the Windows horde still use. Anyone 
who pretends to talk oh-so-knowingly about a 
CD-ROM disk or DVD disk is likely a dweeb, and 
you should steer as far away from that dweeb 
as possible in the future.

Personalizing the Big X
22
Personalizing the Big X
After the installation is complete and you have rebooted the beast, stand 
back and watch those beautiful rounded edges, brushed stainless-steel surfaces, 
and liquid colors appear. But wait — you’re not quite done yet! Mac OS X needs 
to be personalized for you, just like your toothbrush or your SUV’s six-way 
power seat; therefore, use the Setup Wizard that automatically appears the first 
time you boot Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
These wizard screens change periodically — and they’re completely self-
explanatory — so I won’t march you through each one step by step. However, 
here are a few tips that provide a bit of additional over-the-shoulder help 
while you’re setting things up.
 
✦ How rude! If you’re outside the United States or other English-speaking 
countries, you should know that Mac OS X defaults to U.S. formats and 
keyboard layouts. Rest assured, though, because Mac OS X does indeed 
provide full support for other languages and keyboard configurations. 
To display these options in the list boxes, click the Show All button at 
the bottom of the wizard screen.
 
✦ Accounts are important. When Mac OS X asks you to create your 
account, don’t forget your password — oh, and they’re case sensitive, 
too, so THIS is different from this or ThiS. It’s a good idea to enter a pass-
word hint, but don’t make that hint too easy to guess. For example, My 
first dog’s name is probably preferable to Plays Seinfeld on TV. Mac OS 
X uses the name and password that you enter to create your account, 
which you use to log in if you set up a multiuser system for several 
people. (More on this in Book II, Chapter 4.) Never write down your pass-
words, either; such crib sheets work just as well for others as for you.
 
✦ I need to fix that. You can click the Back button any time to return to 
previous wizard screens. Mac OS X, being the bright child that it is, 
automatically saves your choices for you, so when you click Continue to 
return, everything is as you left it.
 
✦ Extra stuff. Whether you decide to accept the news, offers, and related-
product information from Apple is your decision. However, it’s only 
right that I point out that you can find this same information on the 
Apple Web site, so there’s no need to engorge your e-mail Inbox unless 
you so desire. (In other words, I turned this off.)
 
✦ Local area network (LAN) connections. If you’re connecting your Mac 
to a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network 
(or you’re using an Internet router that uses Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol [DHCP]), it’s a good idea to click Yes when you’re asked whether 
you should use the configuration supplied by the existing server.

 DHCP automatically provides the computers on the network with all the 
settings that they need to connect. If that sounds like ancient Sumerian, 
find out more in Book VI, Chapter 1.
 
✦ Do create your MobileMe account! Apple’s MobileMe service just plain 
rocks — especially the iDisk storage that you receive. Again, more on 
this in Book V, Chapter 4, but take my word for it. Join up, trooper. (The 
trial subscription is free, and it’s easy to upgrade to a full membership if 
you decide that you like the MobileMe benefits.)
 
✦ Have your Mail settings handy. If you set up your trial MobileMe 
account, you can set up your @me.com address without any bother — 
again, this is A Good Thing. However, if you’re setting up an existing 
account, make sure you have all those silly settings and numbers and 
names that your ISP supplied you with when you signed up. This stuff 
includes your e-mail address, mail server variety, user account ID, pass-
word, and outgoing mail server.

A
s the folks in Cupertino will tell you, “It’s all about the graphics.” They’re 
right, of course — Mac OS X is a highly visual operating system, and using 
it without a mouse is like building Hoover Dam with a pocketknife. (And not a 
particularly sharp pocketknife, either.) Therefore, most of this chapter requires 
you to firmly grasp the little rodent — I introduce you to little graphical bits such 
as icons and menus, and you discover how to open windows that can display 
anything from the contents of a document to the contents of your hard drive.
On the other hand, any true Macintosh power user will tell you that the 
keyboard is still a useful piece of hardware. Because I want you to be a 
bona fide, well-rounded Mac OS X power user, I also demonstrate those key 
combinations that can save you time, effort, and possible tennis elbow from 
all that mouse-wrangling.
Finally, I lead you through the basic training that you need to run your 
programs: how to start them, how to open and save documents, and how 
to quit an application as gracefully as Fred Astaire on his best day.
Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
First things first. As the guy on the rocket sled probably yelled, “This is neat, but 
how do you stop it?” Call ’em The Big Three — Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down 
are the Mac OS X commands that you use when you need to take care of busi-
ness away from your computer. All three appear on the friendly Apple menu 
(Ú) at the top-left corner of your Desktop (as shown in friendly Figure 2-1).

26
Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
 
Figure 2-1: 
Choose your 
path from 
the Apple 
menu.
 
I should probably also mention the other guys: 
the Log Out command (which you can find 
under the Apple menu) and the User Switch 
menu (at the right side of the Finder menu).
 ✓ Choose Log Out when you’re running your 
Mac with multiple users and you want to 
completely pass control over to another 
person. All your programs will quit, and the 
other person can take over by logging in 
with his/her account. Mac OS X then recon-
figures with the other user’s preferences.
 ✓ If you’ve enabled Fast User Switching, 
another user can log in from the User 
Switch menu. However, your applications 
don’t quit, you don’t have to formally log 
out, and you can take control back when 
the other user is finished. (Hence the words 
Fast and Switching in the name.) To turn 
on this feature, log in with an administra-
tor account, display the Accounts pane in 
System Preferences, click Login Options, 
and then select the Enable Fast User 
Switching check box. (More on Fast User 
Switching appears in Book II, Chapter 4.)
Actually, we’re not finished just yet. . . .

Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
Each of these options produces a different reaction from your Mac:
 
✦ Sleep: You don’t need a glass of water or a bedtime story when you put 
Mac OS X to Sleep, which is a power-saving mode that allows you to 
quickly return to your work later. (Waking your computer up from Sleep 
mode is much faster than booting or restarting it, and Sleep mode can 
conserve battery power on laptops.) Depending on the settings that you 
choose in System Preferences — which I discuss in Book II, Chapter 3 — 
your Mac can power-down the monitor and spin-down the hard drives 
to save wear and tear on your hardware. You can set Mac OS X to 
automatically enter Sleep mode after a certain amount of mouse and 
keyboard inactivity. To awaken your slumbering supercomputer, just 
click the mouse or press any key on the keyboard. MacBook owners can 
put their laptops to sleep by simply closing the computer; they can wake 
the beast by opening it back up again.
 
✦ Restart: Use Restart if your Mac has suddenly decided to work “outside 
the box” and begins acting strangely — for instance, if your Universal 
Serial Bus (USB) ports suddenly lock up or your FireWire drive no longer 
responds. Naturally, you first need to save any work that’s open (unless 
your computer has locked up altogether). You also elect to restart Mac 
OS X when you switch startup volumes, or switch an Intel-based Mac to 
a Windows XP or Vista partition using Boot Camp. (Many applications 
and Apple software updates require a restart after you install them.)
 
✦ Shut Down: When you’re ready to return to the humdrum, real world 
and you’re done with your Mac for the time being, use the Shut Down 
option. Well-behaved Mac applications will automatically prompt you 
to save any changes that you’ve made to open documents before the 
computer actually turns itself off (or restarts itself). If you’ve configured 
your Mac with multiple accounts, you can shut down Mac OS X from the 
login screen as well.
Besides the Apple menu command, many Macs have a Power key on the 
keyboard that you can press to display the dialog that you see in Figure 2-2. 
If you change your mind and decide to tie up loose ends before you leave, 
click the Cancel button to return to Mac OS X.

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
 
If your Mac has a Drive Eject key that you use to load and eject discs, you 
can hold down the Control key and press the Drive Eject key to display the 
same options.
A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
“And in the beginning, there was the window.” As with older Mac operating 
systems, most of what you’ll do in Mac OS X occurs within these fancy 
frames. And, as you might imagine, a number of controls are at your 
disposal, which you can use to control the size, shape, and appearance of 
these potent portals. In this section, I — well, to be blunt, I do windows. 
(No squeegee jokes, if you please.)
Opening and closing windows
Windows are generally opened automatically. Usually, a window gets opened 
by an application (when you first run it or it needs to display a document) or 
by Mac OS X itself (when the Finder opens a window to display the contents 
of your hard drive). The Finder, by the way, is the application that Mac OS X 
runs to display the operating system’s menus and windows.
Some programs even let you open new windows on the fly; for example, 
Figure 2-3 illustrates a window in its purest form: a new Finder window. To 
display this window on your own Mac, choose File➪New Finder Window or 
press Ô+N. From here, you can reach any file on your Mac or even venture 
to the Internet.

Finder 
window.

Navigating and

29
A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
 
The Command key usually has both an Apple (Ú) and a rather strange-
looking symbol (Ô) on it that I often call the Spirograph.
When you’re finished with a document or you no longer need a window 
open, you can close it to free that space on your Desktop. To close a window 
in Mac OS X, move your mouse pointer over the Close button; it’s the red 
circular button at the top-left corner of the window (see Figure 2-3). An X 
appears on the button when you’re in the zone. When the X appears, just 
click the mouse.
 
If you’ve been living the life of a hermit in a cave for the last decade or so, 
pressing the mouse button is called clicking the mouse. In the Apple uni-
verse, a standard mouse may sport only one button; heck, current MacBooks 
don’t have any buttons at all! (You tap the trackpad with one finger to click.) 
If you’re using an Apple Mighty Mouse, a trackball, or an über-mouse with a 
right mouse button, a right-click usually acts the same as holding down the 
Control key while you click with an older one-button Apple mouse or trackpad.
Most Mac applications don’t want you closing a window willy-nilly if you’ve 
changed the contents without saving them. For example, try to close a 
document window in Word or Pages without saving the file first. The program 
asks you for confirmation before it closes the window containing your Great 
American Novel. Most programs also have a Close command on their File 
menu. (Here’s another indicator: Most programs display a black dot in the 
center of the program’s Close button to indicate that there are unsaved 
changes.)
 
To close all windows that are displayed by a particular program, hold down 
the Option key while you click the Close button on one of the windows. 
Whoosh! They’re all gone.
Scrolling windows
Often, more stuff is in a document or more files are on your hard drive 
than you can see in the space available for a window. Guess that means it’s 
time to delete stuff. No, no, just joking! You don’t have to take such drastic 
measures to see more in a window.
Just use the scroll bars that you see in Figure 2-4 to move through the 
contents of the window. You click the scroll bar and drag it — for the 
uninitiated, that means clicking the bar and holding down the mouse button 
while you move the mouse in the desired direction. Alternatively, you can 
click in the empty area above or below the bar to scroll pages one at a time.

Depending on the type of application that you’re using, you might be able to 
scroll a window with your arrow keys as well — or perhaps use the Page Up 
and Page Down keys to move through a window.
Minimizing and restoring windows
The multitalented Figure 2-4 also displays another control that you can use 
with a window: the Minimize button. When you minimize a window, you 
eliminate it from your Desktop and store it safely in the Dock — that strip of 
icons that appears along the bottom (or the side) of your Mac OS X Desktop. 
In fact, a minimized window appears as a miniature icon in the Dock, so you 
can actually keep an eye on it (so to speak). Figure 2-5 illustrates a minimized 
window from Safari, which is actually displaying my Web site at www.
mlcbooks.com. To minimize a window, move your mouse pointer over the 
yellow Minimize button at the top-left corner of the window — a minus sign 
appears on the button — and then click.

You’re gonna love this “Easter egg” hidden in Mac OS X — if you hold down 
the Shift key whilst you minimize, the window shrinks in cool slow motion. 
(Who says operating systems have to be totally serious, anyway?)
When you’re ready to display the window again on your Desktop — a pro-
cess called restoring the window — simply click the thumbnail icon repre-
senting the window in the Dock, and Mac OS X automagically returns it to its 
former size and location.
By the way, some — note that I said some — applications continue to run 
when minimized, whereas others simply stop or pause until you return them 
to the Desktop. Such is the crazy world we live in.
Zooming windows
Zooming windows has a kind of Flash Gordon sound to it, don’t you think? 
It’s nothing quite that exciting — no red tights or laser guns — still, when 
you’re trying to view a larger portion of a document, zooming is a good thing 
because it expands the window to the maximum practical size for the appli-
cation that you’re using (and the content being displayed). In some cases, 
zooming a window fills the entire screen; in others, the extra space would 
be wasted, so the application zooms the window to the maximum size that 
shows as much content as possible (without any unnecessary white space). 
In fact, the Zoom button can even be disabled by an application that doesn’t 
want you to muck about with the window; for example, I own some games 
that don’t allow zooming.
To zoom a window, move your mouse pointer over the green Zoom button 
at the top-left corner of the window. Again, Figure 2-4 (a couple of sections 
back) struts its stuff and illustrates the position. (Man, that is one versatile 
figure.) A plus sign appears on the Zoom button. Click to expand your horizons.
 
After you’ve finished with a zoomed window, you can return it to its 
previous dimensions by clicking the Zoom button again.

If you’re wondering what that little lozenge-shaped button is at the right 
corner of many Mac OS X application windows, I won’t leave you in sus-
pense: This button toggles the display of the window’s toolbar on and off. 
A toolbar is a strip of icons that appears across the top of a window that 
you can click to perform common commands, such as changing the display 
format or printing the current document. (The toolbar in Figure 2-4, for 
example, features icons to move Back and Forward, among others.) You’ll 
encounter more toolbar technology throughout the book.
Moving windows
In contrast to the rather permanent windows in your home, you can pick a 
window and cart it to another portion of the Desktop. Typically, you do this 
when you’re using more than one application at a time and you need to see 
the contents of multiple windows. To grab a window and make off with it, 
click the window’s title bar — the strip at the top of the window that usually 
bears a document or application name — and drag the window to the new 
location. Then release the mouse button to plant the window firmly in the 
new location.
 
By the way, some applications allow you to arrange multiple windows in a 
graceful swoop with a single click of a menu. Click the Window menu and 
choose Arrange All to perform this magic.
I talk about Exposé and Spaces later, in the section “Switching ’Twixt Programs 
with Aplomb.” Exposé helps you organize a large number of open windows on 
your Desktop. You can use it to display all open application windows so that 
you can pick the one you want . . . or even display all the windows opened by a 
specific application. Spaces allows you to create entire custom virtual desktops. 
(Truly cool.) Each of your Spaces desktops can contain a different set of applica-
tion windows that you use for different tasks!
Resizing windows
Next, consider how to change the width or height of your window. To 
change the dimensions of a window to your exact specifications, move your 
mouse pointer over the lower-right corner of the window (which is usually 
marked with a number of slashed lines to indicate its status as a control), 
click, and drag until the window is the size that you prefer.

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
Switching windows
Before I move on to other graphical wonders of Mac OS X, it’s important that 
you master how to switch between windows on your Desktop. First, remem-
ber this old Norwegian saying (or is it one of Mark’s Maxims?):
 
Only one can be active at one time.™
What our Oslo friends are communicating is that only one window can be 
active at any time. The active window appears on top of other windows, and 
it’s the one that you can edit by typing or by moving your mouse. (It also 
sports Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons in color.) Other windows that 
you have opened might be minimized, as I describe earlier, in the section 
“Minimizing and restoring windows,” or they can be inactive (mere ghosts 
of themselves) and remain on your Desktop. Mac OS X dims the controls for 
inactive windows so that you can tell they’re hanging around . . . but you 
can’t use them at the moment. Figure 2-6 illustrates a number of open 
windows, with the iTunes window active.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Many are 
open, but 
only one is 
active.

Menu Mysteries Explained
I know you’re going to get tired of hearing me say this, but here I go again: 
Certain applications will continue to run while their windows are inactive, 
such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients and others. Most programs, 
however, stop or pause until you make their window active.
And how do you switch to — activate — a different window in Mac OS X? Again, 
Exposé allows you to activate another window, but if the window is currently 
visible, you can simply click any part of that window. I generally click the 
window’s title bar if it’s visible, but any part of the inactive window will do. (You 
can also right-click the application’s icon in the Dock and choose the desired 
window from the menu.) The window that you click leaps like a proud stallion to 
the fore, and the previously active window now skulks in the background.
 
You can still use a window’s Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons even when 
the window is inactive.
Menu Mysteries Explained
Next, I move on to menu control in Mac OS X. Menus are handy drop-down 
controls that allow you to select commands that are grouped together logi-
cally. For example, an application’s File menu usually allows you to create 
or open a document, save a document to disk, or quit the program. To pull 
down a menu, click the desired menu group name on the bar at the top of 
the screen and then click the desired menu option from the extended menu.
Figure 2-7 illustrates the Safari menu: Note the submenus designated by 
right-arrow icons. When you move your mouse pointer over a submenu 
command, you get another set of even more specific menu commands — in 
this case, the Services submenu command displays commands, such as Mail 
and Grab.
 
Some applications allow you to create your own custom menus; naturally, 
configuring a new menu system takes some time to figure out, but imagine 
the productivity gains that you’ll enjoy! For example, my menus in Microsoft 
Word 2008 for Mac feature only the commands that I use often — they’re 
sleeker and easier to navigate. (However, you have to stop short of claiming 
that you wrote the application. And yes, I already checked with Microsoft, 
which got downright snippy about it.)
Mac OS X also provides another type of menu: contextual. A contextual 
menu appears when you hold down the Control key and click certain items 
on the screen, revealing commands that relate specifically to that item. 
(Unfortunately, the items that sport contextual menus vary from application 
to application, so it’s best to check the documentation for a program before 
you spend countless hours Control-clicking everything on-screen.) The same 
items in the Control-click menu appear when you select an item and then 
click the Action pop-up menu, which looks like a mechanical gear.

As I mention earlier, Apple’s current crop of desktop and laptop pointing 
devices all have methods (such as a right-click) of activating a contextual 
menu. Many manufacturers sell mice, trackballs, and other pointing things 
that include a secondary mouse button. Generally, if you have a pointing 
device with multiple buttons, the device displays contextual menus when 
you click the secondary button. Then again, you might launch Aunt Harriet 
into a geosynchronous orbit, so double-check the manual for your pointing 
thing on the default button assignment (and how to change it, if necessary).
You’ll note that many commands in menus have keyboard shortcuts. 
Because I hold forth on this subject in the upcoming section, “Keyboard 
Shortcuts for the True Power User,” I hold off describing those shortcuts 
here.
Icons ’R Us
Icons are more than little pictures. They’re . . . well . . . actually, I guess 
they’re little pictures. However, these graphical WUDs (that’s short for 
Wonderful User Devices) are really representations of the components of 
your Mac OS X system, and therefore they deserve a section of their own.

36
Icons ’R Us
 
For complete details on what any icon is, what it represents, and what it 
does, click the icon once to highlight it and then press Ô+I. This displays the 
Info dialog that you see in Figure 2-8, which tells you what kind of icon it is, 
where the item it represents is actually located, and how big it is. You also 
see a version number for applications — a handy way of quickly checking 
the version of a program you’re running — and when the file was created 
and last modified. The Info dialog also offers other settings and options that 
you can display by clicking in the General section, and I cover them in other 
parts of the book.
Hardware
Mac OS X uses icons to represent the various hardware devices of your com-
puter, including your
 
✦ Hard drive
 
✦ DVD drive (if a disc is loaded)
 
✦ iPod
 
Figure 2-8:

You get the idea. Just double-click a hardware icon to display the folders 
and files that it contains, as you do with your hard drive and a disc loaded in 
your DVD drive.
Generally, you’ll encounter hardware icons only on your Desktop or in 
Finder windows, or within a device or source list in applications such as 
iTunes and iPhoto. Figure 2-9 illustrates some of the hardware icons that live 
in my system.

icons.
 
Programs and applications
These are the fancy icons, folks. Most applications have their own custom 
icons, and double-clicking one will typically whisk you on your way. Mac OS X 
also includes a generic icon or two for applications that don’t include their 
own custom icon. Figure 2-10 illustrates a number of my favorite program 
icons from all sorts of Mac OS X applications.
Running a program in Mac OS X can be as simple as double-clicking the 
application icon — more on this later, in the section “Houston, We’re Go to 
Launch Programs.”
Files
Your hard drive will contain many thousands of individual files, and the Big X 
tries to make it as easy as possible to visually identify which application 
owns which file. Therefore, most applications use a special icon to indi-
cate their data files. For example, Figure 2-11 illustrates several documents 
and data files created by a range of applications: Microsoft Word, Pages, 
QuickTime, Safari, and Adobe Acrobat. Some cheeky applications even use 
more than one icon to differentiate among different file types, such as docu-
ments and templates in Microsoft Word.

documents, which use the Adobe Acrobat format.
 
You can open most documents and data files by double-clicking them, which 
automatically launches the proper application and loads the document.
Folders
Folders have a 3-D look in Mac OS X — and, as you can see in Figure 2-12, 
some applications even customize their folder icon!

Figure 2-12:

Major system folders — including Applications, Library, System, Users, 
Downloads, and Utilities — sport distinctive folder icons in Snow Leopard 
that help identify their contents.
To open a folder within Mac OS X, just double-click it. (Alternatively, you can 
click it once to select it and then press Ô+O.) Discover more about how to 
control the look of folder icons in Book II, Chapter 1.
Aliases
An alias is a strange beast. Although it might look like a standard icon, upon 
closer examination, you’ll notice that an alias icon sports a tiny curved 
arrow at the base, and the tag alias often appears at the end of the icon 
name. Figure 2-13 has roped in a variety of aliases for your enjoyment, along 
with one or two actual icons for comparison.
 
Figure 2-13: 
An alias is 
a pointer 
to another 
application, 
file, or 
folder.
 
Essentially, an alias is a link to something else on your system. For example, an 
Adobe Photoshop alias can run Photoshop just as the actual program icon can, 
but it takes up only a scant few bytes on your hard drive. (If you’re a Switcher 
who’s just crossed over from the Windows Wilderness, think shortcut — 
Windows shortcuts work in a similar manner.) The alias file is just big enough to 
hold the location of the actual file or folder, allowing it to yell at Mac OS X: “Hey, 
the Human actually wants you to run this or open that thing over there!”

40
Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
Aliases come in handy for a number of reasons:
 
✦ They allow you to launch applications and open files and folders 
from anywhere in your system. For example, you might want an alias 
icon in your MP3 folder that runs the DVD-burning application Toast. 
With an alias icon, you can launch Toast and burn a data DVD without 
laboriously navigating to the Toast folder, which could be nested in 
goodness-knows-how-many layers of subfolders.
 
✦ They can be easily deleted when no longer needed without wreaking 
havoc on the original application, file, or folder. If you decide that 
you’d rather use iTunes to burn audio CDs, you can simply delete the 
Toast alias without trashing Toast itself.
 
✦ Their tiny size allows you to add multiple aliases (and mucho 
convenience) for a single application without gulping down hard 
drive space.
 
You might be wondering, “Why use aliases when I can just copy the actual 
application, file, or folder to the desired spot?” Well, indeed you can do that. 
However, the application might not work in its new location because you 
didn’t copy any of the supporting files that most applications need to run. 
(An alias actually runs the original application or opens the original file or 
folder, so things should work just as if you’d double-clicked the original 
icon.) Additionally, remember that copying applications willy-nilly through-
out your hard drive will eat up territory like a horde of angry Vikings.
 
If you dislike the alias hanging off the end of the icon name, feel free to 
rename it (as I show you in Chapter 3 of this minibook). The alias will con-
tinue to function nicely no matter what moniker you give it. (If you create an 
alias by holding down Ô+Option whilst dragging the original icon to a new 
location, the alias name won’t include the alias appendage.)
If the original file no longer exists, an alias naturally no longer works, either. 
However, Mac OS X is sharp enough to automatically “fix” an alias if you 
rename or move the original file, pointing it to the new location (as long as it 
remains on the same volume). Slick!
Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
You’ll often find yourself performing different actions on one icon — or a 
number of icons at one time. For example, you can copy or move files from 
one location on your hard drive to another, or delete a group of files that 
you no longer need. (The idea of drag-and-drop file management using icons 
originated on the Macintosh, but I wait until Chapter 3 of this minibook to 
describe these operations in detail.) In this section, I focus on the basics of 
selecting one or more icons to specify the files and folders you want to use 
for whatever you’re going to do next.

Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
Selecting a single icon
First, here are the various ways that you can select a single icon for an 
impending action:
 
✦ Place your mouse pointer over the file and click once. Mac OS X darkens 
the icon to indicate that it’s selected — a mysterious process called 
highlighting.
 
✦ Type the first few letter of the icon’s name. After you type a letter, Mac 
OS X highlights the first icon that matches that character.
 
✦ If an icon in a window is already highlighted, you can move the high-
light to the next icon across by pressing the right-arrow key. Likewise, 
the other three directional arrow keys move the highlight in the other 
directions. To move through the icons alphabetically, press Tab to go 
forward and Shift+Tab to go backward.
Selecting multiple icons
To select a gaggle of icons for an action, use one of these methods:
 
✦ If the icons are next to each other, click and drag within the window 
(and not directly on a specific item) to highlight them all. While you 
drag, Mac OS X displays a selection box, and any icons you touch with 
that box are highlighted when you release the mouse button (as shown 
in Figure 2-14). Think “lasso” and you’ll get the picture.

42
Keyboard Shortcuts for the True Power User
 
✦ You can also select multiple adjacent icons by clicking the first item to 
highlight it and then holding down the Shift key while clicking the last 
icon in the series that you want to select.
 
 If the icons are not next to each other, you can hold down the Ô key 
while you click each item that you want to select.
Just selecting an icon doesn’t launch or do anything . . . you’re just marking 
your territory.
Keyboard Shortcuts for the True Power User
Virtually all Mac OS X applications have their own keyboard shortcuts — a 
ten-cent term for a key combination that performs the same operation as a 
menu command or a toolbar button. Although the mouse might seem the 
easier path when controlling your Mac, it’s not always the fastest. Those 
hardy souls who venture to learn common keyboard shortcuts can zip 
through a spreadsheet or warp through a complex outline at speeds that no 
mere rodent-wrangler could ever hope to attain.
With that in mind — and with the goal of “pumping you up” into a power 
user — I hereby present the most common keyboard shortcuts for the Big X 
in Table 2-1. I’ve also sprinkled other keyboard shortcuts liberally through 
the book when I discuss other applications, but these combinations are the 
classics that appear virtually everywhere.

hieroglyphics, but you need only hold down the first two keys simultaneously 
and press the third key. Common “strange” key symbols that you’ll see in 
both the Finder and most applications are shown in Table 2-2.

The next stop on your introductory tour of Mac OS X is the launch pad for 
your applications. Although the Finder is useful, you’ll likely want to actually 
do something with your Mac as well.
Running applications from your hard drive
You can launch an application from your hard drive by
 
✦ Navigating to the corresponding application folder — by either clicking 
or double-clicking drive and folder icons — and double-clicking the 
application icon.

44
Houston, We’re Go to Launch Programs
 
✦ Double-clicking a document or data file that’s owned by the application. 
For example, double-clicking an MP3 audio file runs iTunes.
 
✦ Double-clicking an alias that you’ve created for the application. (Get the 
skinny on aliases in the earlier section, “Aliases.” I’ll wait.)
 
✦ Clicking the application’s icon in the Dock (more on adding items to the 
Dock in Book II, Chapter 2).
 
✦ Selecting the application icon and pressing the Ô+O keyboard shortcut.
 
✦ Clicking the Menu button on an Apple Remote to display the Front Row 
menu. From here, you can choose to watch a DVD movie (using Apple’s 
DVD Player), peruse your collection of digital images (using iPhoto), 
watch a video you’ve created (using iMovie), or listen to music (using 
iTunes). The applications are launched automatically when you select 
the media you want to play. (You can find more on Front Row in Chapter 
5 of this minibook.)
 
✦ Adding the application to your Login Items list. (I cover the Login Items 
list in more detail in Book II, Chapter 3.)
Running applications from a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
After you load a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, you can display its contents by 
double-clicking the disc icon that appears on your Desktop. A Finder window 
opens and shows the files that reside on the disc. (See Figure 2-15.)

After you locate the application you want to run on the disc, you can launch 
it by double-clicking it or selecting it and pressing Ô+O.
Switching ’Twixt Programs with Aplomb
You might think that juggling multiple applications will lead to confusion, 
fatigue, and dry mouth, but luckily Mac OS X makes it easy to jump between 
programs that are running on your Mac. Use any of these methods to jump 
from open application to application:
 
✦ Click anywhere in the desired window to make it the active window.
 
✦ Click the application icon in the Dock. All applications that are running 
have an icon in the Dock, and the icon will have a shiny dot beneath it to 
indicate that the application is open.
 
✦ Press Ô+Tab. If you have a dozen windows open, this can get a bit 
tedious, which leads us to one of Snow Leopard’s sassiest features, 
brazenly named Exposé and shown in Figure 2-16. (Am I stretching 
things a bit?)

46
Switching ’Twixt Programs with Aplomb
 
✦ Press F9 (or F3, depending on your keyboard) to show all open 
application windows using Exposé; then click the one you want. 
Figure 2-16 illustrates the tiled window display on my Mac after I press 
F3. The cursor changes into the traditional (and highly elegant) gloved 
hand. Move the cursor on top of the window you want to activate — the 
window turns blue when it’s selected — and click once to switch to that 
window. You can specify which keys you want to use to control Exposé 
within System Preferences.
 
✦ Press F10 (or Control+F3, depending on your keyboard) to show all 
open windows from the application that you’re currently using; then 
click the one that you want to activate. This Exposé function is great 
for choosing from all the images that you’ve opened in Photoshop or all 
the Safari Web pages littering your Desktop!
Along with the window switch, an astute observer will notice that the 
application menu bar also changes to match the now-active application.
 
Besides the F9/F3 and F10/Control+F3 hot keys that I just discussed, Exposé 
provides one more nifty function: Press F11 (or Ô+F3), and all your open 
windows scurry to the side of the screen. (Much like a herd of zebras if you 
dropped a lioness in the middle.) Now you can work with drives, files, and 
aliases on your Desktop — and when you’re ready to confront those dozen 
application windows again, just press the keyboard shortcut a second time.
Ah, but what if you want to switch to an entirely different set of applications? 
For example, let’s suppose that you’re slaving away at your pixel-pushing 
job — designing a magazine cover with Pages. Your page design desktop 
also includes Photoshop and Aperture, which you switch between often 
using one of the techniques I just described. Suddenly, however, you realize 
you need to schedule a meeting with others in your office using iCal, and you 
want to check your e-mail in Apple Mail. What to do?
Well, you could certainly launch those two applications on top of your 
graphics applications, and then minimize or close them . . . but with 
Snow Leopard’s Spaces feature, you can press the Control+Left Arrow 
or Control+Right Arrow sequences to switch to a completely different 
“communications” desktop, with iCal and Apple Mail windows already open 
and in your favorite positions! (Figure 2-17 illustrates the Spaces screen, 
showing two available desktops.)
After you’re done setting up your meeting and answering any important 
e-mail, simply press Control+Left Arrow or Control+Right Arrow again to 
switch back to your “graphics” desktop, where all your work is exactly as 
you left it!
Now imagine that you’ve also created a custom “music” desktop for 
GarageBand and iTunes . . . or perhaps you paired iWeb, MobileMe, and 
iPhoto together as a “Webmaster” desktop. See why everyone’s so excited? 
(Let’s see Windows Vista do that out of the box.)

In contrast to Exposé, Spaces has to be enabled and configured before you 
can use it. You can create new desktops, customize your desktops, and 
even choose a different set of key sequences to activate Spaces from within 
System Preferences. For the complete story on configuring Spaces, see Book 
II, Chapter 3.
Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
Almost all Mac OS X applications open and save documents in the same 
way, whether you’re creating a presentation with Keynote or expressing 
your cinematic side with iMovie. Therefore, I take a moment to outline the 
common procedures for opening and saving documents. Believe me, you’ll 
perform these two rituals dozens of times a week, so no nodding off.
Opening a document
First, the simple way to load a document: Double-click that document in a 
Finder window, and . . . well, that’s it. (This is my preferred method because 
I’m an ALT — short for Admitted Lazy Techno-wizard — who would rather 
use complex hand movements to pour myself another Diet Coke.)

48
Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
To open a document the hard way — from inside an application — here’s 
the plan:
 
1. Choose File➪Open or press that handy Ô+O key combination.
 
 Your Mac OS X program is likely to display the attractive Open dialog 
that you see in Figure 2-18.
 
Figure 2-18: 
The soon-
to-be-quite-
familiar 
Open dialog.
 
 
2. Navigate to the location of the document that you want to open.
 
 The pop-up menu allows you to jump directly to common locations — 
such as the Desktop, your Home folder, and your iDisk — as well as 
places that you’ve recently accessed (Recent Places).
 
 If the target folder isn’t in your pop-up menu, move the slider at the 
bottom of the dialog to the far left to display your hard drives, DVD 
drives, and network locations.
 
3. Click the habitat where the file will be found.
 
 You’ll note that the right column(s) will change to show you the 
contents of the item that you just clicked. In this way, you can cruise 
through successive folders to find that elusive document. (This somewhat 
time-consuming process is somewhat derisively called drilling — hence, 
the importance of using Recent Items, or dragging files, locations, and 
applications into the sidebar at the left of the Finder.)

Quitting Programs
 
4. When you sight the document that you want to load, either double-
click it or click once to highlight the filename and then click Open.
 
“Hey, the Open dialog can be resized!” That’s right, good buddy — you can 
expand the Open dialog to show more columns and find things more easily. 
Click and drag the bottom-right corner of the Open dialog to resize it. (You 
can also switch from column view to list view or icon view, just as you can in 
a Finder window, using the buttons to the left of the pop-up location menu.)
Saving a document
To save a document, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save.
 
 If you’ve previously saved this document, your application should 
immediately overwrite the existing document with the new copy, and 
you get to return to work . . . end of story. If you haven’t previously 
saved this document, the program will display a Save dialog that’s 
usually very similar to the Open dialog; it generally has a few more 
options, however, so stay frosty.
 
2. Navigate to the location where you’d like to save the document 
and then type a filename.
 
 Often, you can use a default name that’s already provided by the 
thoughtful folks who developed the software. Note that you might be 
given the chance to save the document in several different formats. For 
example, a word processing application might allow you to save a 
document in RTF, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and even 
bargain-basement text format.
 
3. Click Save (or OK, depending on the application).
 
If an application offers a Save As menu option in the File menu, you can in 
effect copy the document by saving a new version of the document under 
another name. Save As comes in particularly handy when you want to retain 
the original version of a document.
Quitting Programs
If I had a twisted and warped sense of humor, I’d simply tell you to quit 
applications by pulling your Mac’s power cord from the wall socket. 
(Luckily, I don’t.) There are, however, more sane ways to exit a program — 
use one of these methods instead:
 
✦ Press the Ô+Q keyboard shortcut.
 
✦ Choose the Application’s named menu and then click Quit.

50
Quitting Programs
 
✦ Control-click (or right-click) the application icon in the Dock and click 
Quit on the pop-up menu that appears.
You can also click the Close button on the application window. Note, how-
ever, that this doesn’t always completely close down the application. For 
example, Safari stays running even if you close the browser window. In 
general, if the application works within a single window (such as System 
Preferences), closing the window also quits the application.

fter you master basic Mac spell-casting — things like selecting items, 
using menus, opening and saving documents, working with windows, 
and launching an application or two — it’s time to delve deeper into Mac OS 
X. (Can you tell I’m a Dungeons & Dragons old-timer?)
In this chapter, I discuss file management, showing you the hidden power 
behind the friendly Apple menu. I also discuss some of the more advanced 
menu commands, how to print within most applications, and how to listen 
to an audio CD on your Mac. (It makes a doggone good stereo.) Finally, I 
introduce you to the built-in CD/DVD recording features within the Big X and 
how to add a standard USB printer to your system.
The Finder: It’s the Wind beneath Your Wings
So what exactly is the Finder anyway? It’s a rather nebulous term, but in 
essence, the Finder gives Mac OS X the basic functions that you’ll use for 
the procedures I outline in this chapter. This multitasking uber OS has been 
around in one guise or another since the days of System 6 — the creaking 
old days when a Mac was an all-in-one, toteable computer with a built-in 
screen. Come to think of it, some things never change.

The Finder: It’s the Wind beneath Your Wings
52
The Finder is always running, so it’s always available — and you can always 
switch to it, even when several other applications are open and chugging 
away. Figure 3-1 illustrates the Dock with the rather perspective-crazy Finder 
icon at the far left side.
Is that icon supposed to be one face or two faces? I’m still confused, and I’ve 
been using the Mac now since 1989.
 
Don’t forget that Mac OS X gives you a second method of doing everything 
I cover in this chapter: You can use Terminal to uncover the UNIX core of 
Mac OS X, employing your blazing typing speed to take care of things from 
the command line. Of course, that’s not the focus of this book, but for those 
who want to boldly go where no Mac operating system has ever gone before, 
you’ll find more in Book VIII, Chapter 1. Despite what you might have been 
led to believe, power and amazing speed are to be found in character-based 
computing.

Copying and Moving Files and Folders
53
Copying and Moving Files and Folders
Here’s where drag-and-drop makes things about as easy as computing can get:
 
✦ To copy a file or folder from one window to another location on the 
same drive: Hold down the Option key and click and drag the icon from 
its current home to the new location. (Note: You can drop files and 
folders on top of other folders, which puts the copy inside that folder.) 
If you’re copying multiple items, select them first (read how in Book I, 
Chapter 2) and then drag and drop the entire crew.
 
 “Is the Desktop a valid target location for a file or folder?” You’re darn 
tootin’! I recommend, though, that you avoid cluttering up your Desktop 
with more than a handful of files. Instead, create a folder or two on your 
Desktop and then store those items within those folders. If you work 
with the contents of a specific folder often, drag it into the Places head-
ing in the Sidebar (the column at the left side of any Finder window), and 
you can open that folder from the Finder with a single click — no matter 
where you are! (Alternatively, drag the folder to the Dock and drop it 
there, and you can open it with a single click from anywhere.)
 
✦ To copy items from one window to a location on another drive: Click 
and drag the icon from the window to a window displaying the contents 
of the target drive. Or, in the spirit of drag-and-drop, you can simply 
drag the items to the drive icon, which places them in the root folder of 
that drive.
 
✦ To move items from one window to another location on the same 
drive: Simply drag the icon to the new location, whether it be a window 
or a folder. (To move items to a different drive, hold down the Ô key 
while dragging.)
Mac OS X provides you with a number of visual cues to let you know what’s 
being copied or moved. For example, dragging one or more items displays 
a ghost image of the items, and when you’ve positioned the mouse pointer 
over the target, Mac OS X highlights that location to let you know that you’re 
in the zone. If you’re moving or copying items into another Finder window, 
the window border is highlighted to let you know that Mac OS X understands 
the game plan.
 
In case you move the wrong thing or you port it to the wrong location, press 
Ô+Z to undo the previous action.
If the item that you’re dragging already exists in the target location, you 
get a confirmation dialog like the one you see in Figure 3-2. You can choose 
to replace the file, leave the existing file alone, or stop the entire shooting 
match.

Cloning Your Items — It’s Happening Now!
54
 
Figure 3-2:

or not to

is yours.
 
Cloning Your Items — It’s Happening Now!
No need for sci-fi equipment or billions in cash — you can create an exact 
duplicate of any item within the same folder. (This is often handy when you 
need a simple backup of the same file in the same folder or when you’re 
going to edit a document but you want to keep the original intact.)
Click the item to select it and then choose File➪Duplicate (or use the key-
board shortcut and press Ô+D). To distinguish the duplicate from the origi-
nal, Mac OS X adds the word copy to the end of the duplicate’s icon name; 
additional copies have a number added to the name as well.
Alternatively, drag-and-drop aficionados can hold down the Option key and 
drag the original item to another spot in the same window. When you release 
the button, the duplicate appears.
Heck, if you prefer the Control key, you can hold it down while clicking the 
item and then choose Duplicate from the contextual menu that appears. 
Decisions, decisions. . . .
 
Oh, and don’t forget that Action button (it looks like a little gear with a down-
ward-pointing arrow) on the Finder toolbar (refer to Figure 3-1). You can also 
click the Action button and choose Duplicate from the pop-up menu.
When you duplicate a folder, Mac OS X automatically duplicates all the 
contents of the folder as well. Remember that this could take some time if 
the folder contains a large number of small files (or a small number of large 
files). Groucho would’ve loved computers!
Deleting That Which Should Not Be
Even Leonardo da Vinci made the occasional design mistake — his trash can 
was likely full of bunched-up pieces of parchment. Luckily, no trees will be 
wasted when you decide to toss your unneeded files and folders; this section 
shows you how to delete items from your system.

Book I
Chapter 3
Basic OS X 
Housekeeping
Emptying That Wastepaper Basket
55
 
By the way, as you’ll soon witness for yourself, moving items to the Trash 
doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re immediately history.
Dragging unruly files against their will
In Mac OS X, the familiar Macintosh Trash can has been moved to the right 
edge of the Dock — in fact, it’s now a spiffy-looking wire can instead of the 
old clunker that the Mac faithful remember. You can click and drag the items 
that you’ve selected to the Trash and drop them on top of the wire can icon 
to delete them. When the Trash contains at least one item, the wire can icon 
changes to appear as if it were full of trash.
You can also add a Delete icon to your Finder toolbar. For all the details, see 
Book II, Chapter 1.
Deleting with the menus and the keyboard
The mouse isn’t absolutely necessary when deleting items. Your other 
options for scrapping selected files include
 
✦ Choosing File from the Finder menu and choosing the Move to Trash 
menu item
 
✦ Pressing the Ô+Delete keyboard shortcut
 
✦ Clicking the Action button on the Finder toolbar and selecting Move to 
Trash from the pop-up menu
 
✦ Holding down Control while clicking the item to display the contextual 
menu and then choosing Move to Trash from that menu
Emptying That Wastepaper Basket
As I mention earlier, moving items to the Trash doesn’t actually delete them 
immediately from your system. Believe me, this fail-safe measure comes in 
handy when you’ve been banging away at the keyboard for several hours 
and you stop paying close attention to what you’re doing. (I usually also 
blame lack of Diet Coke.) More on how to rescue files from the Trash in the 
next section.
 
As you can with any folder, you can check the contents of the Trash by 
clicking its icon in the Dock.

WAIT! I Need That After All!
56
After you double-check the Trash contents and you’re indeed absolutely 
sure that you want to delete its contents, use one of the following methods 
to nuke the digital Bit Bucket:
 
✦ Choose the Empty Trash menu item from the Finder menu.
 
✦ Choose Secure Empty Trash from the Finder menu.
 
 Believe it or not, if you use the standard Empty Trash command, you still 
haven’t completely zapped that refuse! Some third-party hard drive 
repair and recovery programs will allow an uncool person to restore 
items from the Trash. Use the Secure Empty Trash method for those 
sensitive files and folders that you want to immediately and irrevocably 
delete — the data is overwritten with random characters, making it 
impossible to recover. (A great idea for that Mac you want to sell on 
eBay, no? In fact, if you like, you can reinstall Mac OS X before you ship 
the Mac, leaving the Setup Assistant ready-to-run for the new owner.)
 
✦ Press the Ô+Shift+Delete keyboard shortcut.
 
✦ Click the Trash icon in the Dock, hold down the mouse button, and 
choose Empty Trash from the menu that appears.
 
✦ Hold down Control while clicking the Trash icon in the Dock and then 
choose Empty Trash from the contextual menu that appears.
Depending on the method you select and the settings you choose in System 
Preferences (which I cover in Book II, Chapter 3), Mac OS X might present you 
with a confirmation dialog to make sure that you actually want the Trash 
emptied.
WAIT! I Need That After All!
In the adrenaline-inducing event that you need to rescue something that 
shouldn’t have ended up in the scrap pile, first click the Trash icon in the 
Dock to display the contents of the Trash. Then rescue the items that you 
want to save by dragging them to the Desktop or a folder on your hard drive. 
(This is roughly analogous to rescuing your old baseball glove from the 
family garage sale.)
Feel free to gloat. If someone else is nearby, ask her to pat you on the back 
and call you a lifesaver.
Renaming Your Items
You wouldn’t get far in today’s spacious virtual world without being able to 
change a moniker for a file or folder. To rename an item in Mac OS X, use one 
of these two methods:

Book I
Chapter 3
Basic OS X 
Housekeeping
Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
57
 
✦ With the mouse: Click once on an icon’s name (or just press Return). 
Mac OS X highlights the text in an edit box — type the new name and 
then press Return when you’re done.
 
 You want to wait a few seconds between clicks, as opposed to doing a 
rapid-fire double-click.
 
✦ From the Info dialog: Select the item and press Ô+I to display the Info 
dialog; then click the triangle next to Name & Extension. Click in the 
name field, drag the mouse to highlight the text that you want to change, 
and type the replacement text.
Naturally, the first method is the easiest, and it’s the one that I use most often.
Adding a Dash of Color
Snow Leopard also provides the ability to color-code files and folders to 
help you organize and recognize your data in a hurry. For example, why not 
assign the green label color to the files and folders that make up your cur-
rent project? Or, if you need to mark a file for immediate attention, assign it 
the red label color.
To assign a label color to selected files and folders, you have three options:
 
✦ Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and then click the desired 
color.
 
✦ Hold down Control while you click the selection and then choose the 
color from the pop-up menu. (Remember, if you have a Mighty Mouse, 
or a third-party mouse with a right button, right-clicking performs the 
same function as Control-clicking.)
 
✦ Click File and choose that perfect shade from the menu.
Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
The Finder’s Info dialog is the place to view the specifics on any highlighted 
item (including drives and aliases). Select an item and press Ô+I, click the 
Action toolbar button and then select Get Info from the menu, or choose the 
Finder’s File menu and then choose Get Info (see the results in Figure 3-3). 
If you select more than one item (up to ten items), Snow Leopard opens a 
separate Info dialog for each item.
Mac OS X displays the General information panel when you first open the Info 
dialog, but other panels are usually available (depending on the type of selected 
items). To display the other panels, click the panel that you want to see.

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
58
 
Figure 3-3: 
The General

For most types of files and folders, the Info dialog can tell you
 
✦ Kind: What type of item it is — for example, whether it’s a file, folder, 
drive, or alias
 
✦ Open with: What program launches automatically when you open the 
selected item
 
✦ Size: The total size of the item (or items, if there are more than ten) that 
you select
 
✦ Where: The actual path on your hard drive where the item is located
 
✦ Dates: The date when the item was created and was last modified
 
✦ Version: The application version number
 
✦ Sharing & Permissions: The privileges that control who can do what to 
the file (more on this later, in Book II, Chapter 6) and whether a file is 
locked in read-only mode
Some of this information you can change, and some can only be displayed. 
To banish the Info dialog from your Desktop, click the dialog’s Close button.

You can hide or display various parts of the Info dialog by clicking the 
triangles next to each section heading.
For the rest of this section, I describe a number of tasks that you can 
accomplish from the Info dialog.
 
If you use a specific document over and over as a basis for different revisions, 
you can enable the Stationery Pad check box on the General information panel 
to use the file as stationery. Opening a stationery file automatically creates a 
new, untitled version of the file in the linked application; this can save you 
steps compared with duplicating the file or using the Save As procedure that I 
show you in Book I, Chapter 2.
Adding Spotlight comments
Mac OS X provides you with a Spotlight Comments field, where you can add 
additional text that’s stored along with the file (and can be matched with 
Spotlight). I use this feature to record the version number of manuscript 
chapters and programs that I create during the course of writing books.
To add a comment, follow these steps:
 
1. Display the Info dialog for the item by pressing Ô+I or choosing File➪
Get Info.
 
2. Click in the Spotlight Comments box and type the comment text.
 
 If you need to expand the Spotlight Comments section of the Info dialog, 
click the triangle next to the Spotlight Comments heading. The arrow 
rotates and the Spotlight Comments box appears.
 
3. Close the Info dialog to save the comment.
Displaying extensions
Extensions are alien creatures to most Mac owners. However, these (usu-
ally) three- or four-character add-ons that follow a period at the end of a 
filename have been a mainstay in the Windows and UNIX environments for 
years. An extension identifies what program owns a specific file, and there-
fore which application launches automatically when you double-click that 
file’s icon. Examples of common extensions (and the applications that own 
them) include
 
✦ .pdf: Preview, or Adobe Acrobat
 
✦ .doc: Microsoft Word
 
✦ .pages: Apple Pages
 
✦ .key: Apple Keynote

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
60
 
✦ .psd: Adobe Photoshop
 
✦ .jpeg or .jpg: Preview, or your image editor
 
✦ .tiff or .tif: Preview, or your image editor
 
✦ .htm or .html: Safari, or your Web browser of choice
Why would someone want to see a file’s extension? It comes in handy when 
a number of different types of files are linked to the same application. For 
example, if you install Adobe Photoshop, both JPEG and TIFF images have 
virtually the same icon, so it’s sometimes very hard to tell one from the 
other. With extensions displayed, it’s easy to tell what type of file you’re 
looking at.
Follow this procedure to hide or display extensions with your filenames:
 
1. Display the Info dialog for the item by pressing Ô+I or choosing 
File➪Get Info.
 
2. If you need to expand the Name & Extension section of the Info 
dialog, click the triangle next to the Name & Extension heading.
 
3. To display the extension for the selected file, clear the Hide Extension 
check box to disable it.
 
4. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Choosing the application with which to launch a file
So what’s the plan if the wrong application launches when you double-click a 
file? Not a problem: You can also change the linked application from the Info 
dialog as well. (I told you this was a handy toybox, didn’t I?) Follow these 
steps to choose another application to pair with a selected file:
 
1. Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and click Get Info to dis-
play the Info dialog for the item.
 
2. Click the triangle next to the Open With heading to expand it.
 
3. Click the pop-up menu button.
 
 Mac OS X displays the applications that it feels are best suited to open 
this type of document.
 
4. Select the application that should open the file.
 
 To go completely hog-wild and choose a different application, select 
Other from the pop-up menu. Mac OS X opens a Choose Other 
Application dialog, where you can navigate to and select the application 
you want. (If the application isn’t recognized as recommended, click the 
Enable pop-up menu and choose All Applications.) After you highlight 
the application, click Add.

about making this drastic change. Click Continue to update the other 
files of the same type or click Cancel to return to the Info dialog.
 
6. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Locking files against evildoers
“Holy Item Insurance, Batman!” That’s right, Boy Wonder: Before I leave 
the friendly land of the Info dialog, every Mac owner needs to know how to 
protect files and folders from accidental deletion or editing. By locking a 
file, you allow it to be opened and copied — but not changed, renamed, or 
sent to the Trash. Locked items appear in the Finder with a small padlock 
attached to the icon.
To lock or unlock a file, you have to have ownership of the file. I cover privi-
leges in Book II, but on a Mac where you’ve configured only one administra-
tor account, you should already have ownership.
 
If you’re considering changing the ownership of a system-owned file, don’t do 
it. You could throw a serious monkey wrench into your Snow Leopard system.
To lock a file, follow this procedure:
 
1. Display the Info dialog for the item.
 
2. Select the Locked check box to enable it.
 
 The Locked check box is in the General section of the dialog.
 
3. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Creating an Alias
I mention aliases in Book I, Chapter 2. As I discuss in that chapter, an alias 
acts as a link to an application or document that actually exists elsewhere 
on your system (a handy trick to use when organizing items on your hard 
drive). You have a number of different ways to conjure an alias after you 
select an item:
 
✦ Choose File from the Finder menu and choose the Make Alias menu item. 
(You have to move the alias yourself.)
 
✦ Press the Ô+L keyboard shortcut. (Again, you have to move the new 
alias to its new location.)

Using the Apple Menu
62
 
✦ Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and then click Make Alias.
 
✦ Hold down Control while clicking the selected item and then choose 
Make Alias from the contextual menu that appears.
In addition, you can hold down the Ô+Option key combination and drag the 
item to the location where you want the alias.
 
Although Mac OS X does a great job in tracking the movements of an original 
and updating an alias, some actions can break the link. For example, if you 
delete the original, the alias is left wandering in search of a home. However, 
all is not lost — when you double-click a broken alias, Mac OS X offers to 
help you fix the alias. This involves browsing through your system to locate 
a new original.
Using the Apple Menu
The Apple menu is a familiar sight to any Mac owner. Although Apple con-
templated removing it during the original development and beta cycle for 
Mac OS X version 10.0, the ruckus and cry from beta-testers ensured that it 
remains today. It’s amazing how reassuring that little fellow can be when you 
boot the Big X for the first time.
In this section, I cover the important things that are parked under the Apple 
menu.
Using Recent Items
If you’re like most of us — and I think I’m safe in assuming that you are — 
you tend to work on the same set of applications and files (and use the same 
network servers) during the day. Normally, this would be somewhat of a pain 
because each time you sit down in front of the keyboard, you have to drill 
down through at least one layer of folders to actually reach the stuff that you 
need. To make things easier on yourself, you could create a set of aliases on 
your Desktop that link to those servers, files, and applications . . . but as you 
moved from project to project, you’d find yourself constantly updating the 
aliases. As Blackbeard the Pirate was wont to exclaim, “Arrgh!”
Ah, but Mac OS X is a right-smart operating system, and several years ago, 
Apple created the Recent Items menu to save you the trouble of drilling 
for applications and files (and even network servers as well). Figure 3-4 
illustrates the Recent Items menu from my system. Note that the menu 
is thoughtfully divided into Applications, Documents, and Servers. When 
you open documents or launch applications, they’re added to the list. 
(Accountants will revel in this First In, First Out technology.) To launch an 
application or document from the Recent Items menu — or connect to a net-
work server — just click it.

To wipe the contents of the Recent Items menu — for example, if you’ve just

You can specify the number of recent items that will appear in the menu 
from System Preferences; display the Appearance pane and click the 
Applications, Documents, and Servers list boxes in the Number of Recent 
Items field. (More on this in Book II, Chapter 3.)
 
Also, remember the trick that I mention earlier: You can drag any folder or 
server into the Sidebar column at the left of a Finder window, adding it to 
that exclusive club that includes your Home folder, Applications folder, and 
media folders.

Playing with the Dock

And how The Chief can jet all around the world and take all his stuff along 
with him? Well, the Dock is kind of like that. Sort of.

Using the Apple Menu

If you want your Dock to go mobile as well, click the Apple menu and choose 
the Dock item to display the submenu. Here’s a rundown of the options that 
you’ll find:
 
✦ Hiding: Click Turn Hiding On/Off to toggle the automatic hiding of the 
Dock. With hiding on, the Dock disappears off the edge of the screen 
until you move the mouse pointer to that edge. (This is great for those 
who want to make use of as much Desktop territory as possible for their 
applications.)
 
 You can press Ô+Option+D to toggle Dock hiding on and off from the 
keyboard.
 
✦ Magnification: Click Turn Magnification On/Off to toggle icon magnifica-
tion when your pointer is selecting an icon from the Dock. With magni-
fication on, the icons in the Dock get really, really big . . . a good thing 
for Mr. Magoo or those with grandiose schemes to take over the world. 
Check out the rather oversized icons in Figure 3-5. (The amount of mag-
nification can be controlled from the System Preferences Dock settings, 
which I explain in Book II, Chapter 3.)
 
✦ Position: Click one of three choices (Position on Left, Bottom, or Right) 
to make the Dock appear on the left, bottom, or right of the screen, 
respectively.
 
✦ Dock Preferences: Click this to display the System Preferences Dock set-
tings, which I explain in Book II, Chapter 3.

Bad program! Quit!
Once in a while, you’ll encounter a stubborn application that locks up, slows 
to a crawl, or gets stuck in an endless loop. Although Mac OS X is a highly 
advanced operating system, it can still fall prey to bad programming or cor-
rupted data.
Luckily, you can easily shut down these troublemakers from the Apple menu. 
Just choose Force Quit to display the Force Quit Applications dialog that you 
see in Figure 3-6. (Keyboard types can press Ô+Option+Esc.) Select the appli-
cation that you want to banish and then click the Force Quit button; Mac OS X 
requests confirmation, after which you click the Force Quit button again.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Forcing an 
application

hike.
 
If you select Finder in the Force Quit Applications dialog, the button changes 
to Relaunch. This allows you to restart the Finder, which comes in handy 
if your system appears to be unstable. (This is much faster than actually 
restarting your Mac.)
 
Forcing an application to quit will also quit any open documents that you 
were working with in that application, so save your work (if the program 
will allow you to save anything). If you relaunch the Finder, some programs 
might restart as well.
Tracking down your version
This isn’t a big deal, but if you choose About This Mac from the Apple menu, 
Mac OS X displays the About This Mac dialog that you see in Figure 3-7. 
In case you need to check the amount of memory or the processor in an 
unfamiliar Mac, the About This Mac dialog can display these facts in a twin-
kling. However, I primarily use it to check the Mac OS X version and build 
number as well as to launch the Apple System Profiler (which I discuss in 
full in Chapter 7 of this minibook). Click the More Info button to launch the 
Profiler.

Apple allows you to launch Software Update from both the About This Mac 
dialog and the Apple menu . . . sheesh, they must really want you to keep 
your Big X up to date, I guess.
Specifying a location
Mac OS X allows you to create multiple network locations. Think of a loca-
tion as a separate configuration that you use when you connect to a different 
network from a different locale. For instance, if you travel to a branch office, 
you’d assign a location for your desk and a location for the remote branch. A 
student might assign one location for her home network and another for the 
college computer lab network.
A location saves all the specific values that you’ve entered in the System 
Preferences Network settings, including IP address, DNS servers, proxy 
servers, and the like. If all this means diddly squat to you, don’t worry — I 
explain this in Book VI, Chapter 1. For now, just remember that you can 
switch between locations by choosing Location from the Apple menu, which 
displays a submenu of locations that you can choose among. (You must 
create at least a second location for the Location menu item to appear in the 
Apple menu.)
Availing Yourself of Mac OS X Services
In Mac OS X, Services allow you to merge information from one application 
with another. To Mac old-timers, that might sound suspiciously like the 
Clipboard; however, Services can also include functionality from an applica-
tion, so you can create new documents or complete tasks without running 
another program! Services can be used in both the Finder and Mac OS X 
applications.

To illustrate, here’s a fun example:
 
1. Launch TextEdit (you’ll find it in your Applications folder) and type 
your name.
 
2. Highlight your name.
 
3. Click the TextEdit menu — don’t switch to the Finder; use the TextEdit 
Application menu — and choose Services.
 
4. From the Services submenu, choose Search in Google.
After you’ve shaken your head at all the sites devoted to people with the 
same name, consider what you just did — you ran the Safari application 
from within TextEdit, using selected words! Pretty slick, eh?
A glance at the other Services that show up from within most applications 
gives you an idea of just how convenient and powerful Mac OS X Services 
can be. I often use Services to take care of things such as
 
✦ Sending an e-mail message from an e-mail address in a text file or the 
Address Book (via the Mail Service)
 
✦ Capturing a screen snapshot within an application (using the Grab 
Service)
 
✦ Sending a file to a Bluetooth-equipped PDA or cell phone within an appli-
cation (using the Send File to Bluetooth Device service)
Remember, you can access the Services menu from a Mac OS X application 
by picking that program’s Application menu (sometimes called the named 
menu). For instance, in the demonstration earlier, I use the TextEdit menu 
that appears on the TextEdit menu bar. In Microsoft Word, I would click the 
Word menu.
Geez, I think the computing world needs another word for menu — don’t you?
 
Many third-party applications that you install under Mac OS X can add their 
own commands under the Services menu, so be sure to read the documenta-
tion for a new application to see what Service functionality it adds.

Remember the transporter from “Star Trek”? Step on the little platform, 
assume a brave pose, and whoosh! — you’re transported instantaneously to 
another ship or (more likely) to a badly designed planet exterior built inside 
a soundstage. Talk about convenience . . . that is, as long as the doggone 
thing didn’t malfunction.

Get Thee Hence: Using the Go Menu

The Finder’s Go menu gives you the chance to play Captain Kirk: You can 
jump immediately to specific spots, both within the confines of your own 
system as well as external environments, such as your network or the 
Internet. (You can leave your phaser and tricorder in your cabin.)
The destinations that you can travel to using the Go menu and the iDisk sub-
menu include the following:
 
✦ Back/Forward/Enclosing Folder: I lump these three commands together 
because they’re all basic navigation commands. For example, Back and 
Forward operate just as they do in Safari or your favorite Web browser. 
If you’re currently inside a folder, you can return to the parent folder by 
clicking Enclosing Folder.
 
✦ Computer: This window includes your hard drives, CD and DVD drives, 
and your network — the same places that appear when you open a new 
Finder window with the Ô+N key shortcut.
 
✦ Home: This window displays the home directory for the user currently 
logged in.
 
✦ Desktop: This window displays the files and folders that you’ve stored 
on your Leopard desktop.
 
✦ Network: Did you guess that this displays a window with all your net-
work’s servers? Dead giveaway, that.
 
✦ iDisk: This window displays the contents of your Internet iDisk stor-
age (or someone else’s). (More on the coolness that is iDisk in Book V, 
Chapter 4.)
 
✦ Applications: This window includes all the applications that appear 
in your Mac OS X Applications folder (a neat Just the programs, ma’am 
arrangement that really comes in handy).
 
✦ Documents: Yep, you guessed it: This window displays the contents of 
your Documents folder.
 
✦ Utilities: This window displays the contents of your Mac OS X Utilities 
folder.
 
✦ Recent Folders: This window displays a submenu that allows you to 
choose among the folders that you’ve recently opened.
You can also type the path for a specific folder (use the Go to Folder com-
mand) or connect to a specific network server (use the Connect to Server 
command).
Note that most of the Go menu commands include keyboard shortcuts, prov-
ing once again that the fingers are quicker than the mouse.

Monkeying with the Menu Bar

Monkeying with the Menu Bar
Ever stared at a menu bar for inspiration? Fortunately for Mac owners like 
you and me, people in Cupertino are paid to do just that, and these design-
ers get the big bucks to make the Mac OS X menu bar the best that it can be. 
Thus were born menu bar icons, which add useful controls in what would 
otherwise be a wasted expanse of white.
Using menu bar icons
Depending on your hardware, Mac OS X might install several menu bar 
icons. The Volume icon is always there by default, along with the Clock dis-
play, which is actually an icon in disguise. Figure 3-8 illustrates these stan-
dard icons, along with a couple of others.
 
Figure 3-8: 
Adjust your 
Mac with 
a click of 
these menu 
icons.
 
Some icons won’t appear unless you turn them on. For instance, the Displays 
icon won’t appear unless you enable the Show Displays in Menu Bar check 
box within the Displays pane in System Preferences. The Displays menu 
bar icon, which looks like a monitor, allows you to choose from the recom-
mended resolutions and color depth settings for your graphics card and

monitor. For example, the recommended settings for my MacBook Pro, 
which has an LCD monitor, include 1024 x 768, 1280 x 800, and 1440 x 900 
resolutions, and my display can be set to thousands or millions of colors. 
Typically, it’s a good idea to choose the highest resolution and the highest 
color depth. You can also jump directly to the System Preferences Display 
settings by clicking Displays Preferences in the menu.
To quickly change the audio volume level within Mac OS X, click the Sound 
Volume icon (it looks like a speaker with emanating sound waves) once to 
display its slider control; then click and drag the slider to adjust the level 
up or down. After you select a level by releasing the mouse button, your 
Mac thoughtfully plays the default system sound to help you gauge the new 
volume level.
Depending on the functionality that you’re using with Mac OS X, these other 
menu bar icons might also appear:
 
✦ Modem status: You can turn on the display of the Modem status icon 
from the corresponding modem panel on the Network pane in System 
Preferences, which I discuss in Book II, Chapter 3. The icon can be set to 
show the time that you’ve been connected to the Internet as well as the 
status of the connection procedure. (Naturally, your Mac will need an 
external USB modem to use this status icon.)
 
✦ AirPort: If your Mac is equipped with an AirPort or AirPort Extreme 
card, you can enable the Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar check box 
within System Preferences. To do so, click the Network icon and then 
choose your AirPort connection in the column at the left. The AirPort 
status icon displays the status of the AirPort connection; click the 
AirPort icon to toggle AirPort on or off. The icon displays the relative 
strength of your AirPort signal, whether you’re connected to a Base 
Station or a peer-to-peer computer network, or whether AirPort is 
turned off. You can also switch between multiple AirPort networks from 
the menu.
 
✦ Bluetooth: For those Macs with Bluetooth hardware, you can toggle 
Bluetooth networking on or off. You can also make your Mac dis-
coverable or hidden to other Bluetooth devices, send a file to a 
Bluetooth device, or browse for new Bluetooth devices in your vicinity. 
Additionally, you can set up a Bluetooth device that’s already recog-
nized or open the Bluetooth pane within System Preferences.
 
✦ Time Machine: If you’re using Time Machine to back up your Mac auto-
matically, this icon displays the date of your last backup. You can also 
manually start a backup from the menu bar icon. To display the icon, 
open System Preferences and click the Time Machine icon; then click 
the Show Time Machine Status in the Menu Bar check box to select it.

✦ PPoE: The display of this icon is controlled from the PPoE settings on 
the Network pane within System Preferences. Click this icon to con-
nect to or disconnect from the Internet using Point-to-Point over Ethernet 
(PPoE), which is a type of Internet connection offered by some digital 
subscriber line (DSL) providers.
Doing timely things with the Clock
Even the Clock itself isn’t static eye candy on the Mac OS X menu bar (I told 
you this was a hardworking operating system, didn’t I?). Click the Clock 
display to toggle the icon between the default text display and a miniature 
analog clock. You’ll also find the complete day and date at the top of the 
menu.
In fact, you can even open the System Preferences Date & Time settings from 
the icon. From within the Date & Time settings, you can choose whether the 
seconds or day of the week are included, whether the separators should 
flash, or whether Mac OS X should display the time in 24-hour (military) 
format. More on this in Book II, Chapter 3.
Eject, Tex, Eject!
Mac OS X makes use of both static volumes (your Mac’s hard drive, which 
remains mummified inside your computer’s case) and removable volumes 
(such as USB Flash drives, your iPod, and CDs/DVD-ROMs). Mac OS X calls 
the process of loading and unloading a removable volume by old-fashioned 
terms — mounting and unmounting — but you and I call the procedure loading 
and ejecting.
 
Just to keep things clear, I should point out that we’re talking hardware 
devices here, so static and removable volumes have nothing to do with the 
sound volume control on your menu bar.
I won’t discuss loading/mounting a removable volume — the process differs 
depending on the computer because some Macs need a button pushed on 
the keyboard, others have buttons on the drive itself, and some drives have 
just a slot, with no button at all. However, there are a number of standard 
ways of unloading/unmounting/ejecting a removable volume:
 
✦ Drag the Volume’s icon from the Desktop to the Trash, which displays 
an Eject pop-up label to help underline the fact that you are not deleting 
the contents of the drive. Let me underline that with a Mark’s Maxim 
because Switchers from the Windows world are usually scared to death 
by the concept of dragging a volume to the Trash.

Common Tasks Aplenty
72
 
 Have no fear — in the Apple universe, you can drag removable 
volumes to the Trash with aplomb.
 
✦ Click the Volume’s icon and use the Ô+E keyboard shortcut.
 
✦ With the volume open in a Finder window, click the Action button 
and choose Eject from the pop-up menu.
 
✦ Click the File menu and choose Eject.
 
✦ Click the Eject button next to the device in the Finder window 
sidebar.
 
✦ Right-click the Volume’s icon (or hold down Control and click the 
Volume’s icon) to display the contextual menu; then choose Eject.
 
✦ Press your keyboard Eject key (if it has one) to eject a CD or DVD from 
your built-in optical drive. (If you’re using a keyboard without a Media 
Eject key, press and hold F12 instead.)
You can’t unmount a static volume from the Desktop — you have to use the 
Disk Utility application — so your internal hard drive icon will stay where it is.
Common Tasks Aplenty
Okay, I admit it — this section is kind of a grab bag of three very common 
tasks. However, I want to walk you through these three procedures early in 
the book. Most Mac owners will want to listen to and record CDs as soon as 
“Where the heck did mounting come from, 
anyway? Sounds like a line from a John Wayne 
Western!” Well, pardner, the term dates back 
to the heyday of Big Iron — the Mainframe 
Age, when giant IBM dinosaurs populated the 
computing world. Sherman, set the WayBack 
Machine. . . .
At the time, disks were big, heavy, removable 
cartridges the diameter of dinner plates (and 
about as tall as a 100-count spindle of CD-Rs). 
The acolytes of the mainframe, called computer 
operators, would have to trudge over to a cabinet 
and swap disk cartridges whenever the program 
stopped and asked for them. That’s right, those 
mainframes would actually stop calculating 
and print, “I need you to mount cartridge 12-A-
34, or I can’t go any further. Have a nice day.” 
(Can you imagine what it’d be like loading and 
unloading a hard drive every time you needed 
to open a folder?)
Anyway, even though eons passed and mini-
computers appeared — which were only the 
size of a washing machine — the terms mount-
ing and unmounting still commonly appeared 
in programs. This time, the removable volumes 
were 8-inch floppy disks and tape cartridges. 
Because UNIX (and its offspring Linux) date 
from the Minicomputer Age, these operating 
systems still use the terms.

they start using Snow Leopard, and you’d be amazed how much information 
still flows across the Internet in plain, simple text.
Therefore, hang around and take care of business.
Opening and editing text files
Text files would seem to be another anachronism in this age of formatted 
Web pages, rich text format (RTF) documents, and word processors galore. 
However, virtually every computer ever built can read and write in standard 
text, so text files are often used for
 
✦ Information files on the Internet, such as FAQs (Frequently Asked 
Questions files)
 
✦ README and update information by software developers
 
✦ Swapping data between programs, such as comma- and tab-delimited 
database files
Here’s the quick skinny on opening, editing, and saving an existing text file:
 
1. Navigate to your Applications folder and launch TextEdit.
 
2. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
 
3. Navigate to the desired text file and double-click the filename to load it.
 
 You can also open an existing text file by dragging its icon from the 
Finder window to the TextEdit icon.
 
4. Click the insertion cursor anywhere in the file and begin typing. Or, 
to edit existing text, drag the insertion cursor across the characters to 
highlight them and type the replacement text.
 
 TextEdit automatically replaces the existing characters with those that 
you type. To simply delete text, highlight the characters and press Delete.
 
5. After you finish editing the document, you can overwrite the original 
by pressing Ô+S (which is the same as choosing File➪Save), or you 
can save a new version by choosing File➪Save As and typing a new, 
unique filename.
 
6. To exit TextEdit, press Ô+Q.
Listening to an audio CD
By default, Snow Leopard uses iTunes to play an audio CD. Although I cover 
iTunes in complete detail in Book III, Chapter 2, take a moment to see how 
to master the common task of playing an audio CD (just in case you want to 
jam while reading these early chapters). Follow these steps:
 
1. Load the audio CD into your Mac’s optical drive.
 
 A CD volume icon appears on your Desktop.

Common Tasks Aplenty
74
 
2. Mac OS X automatically loads iTunes and displays its spiffy window.
 
3. By default, iTunes automatically begins playing the disc — however, 
if you have to manually start the music, click the Play button at the 
upper left of the iTunes window to begin playing the disc at the begin-
ning. To play an individual track, double-click the track name in the 
iTunes window.
 
4. To adjust the volume from within iTunes, drag the Volume slider to the 
left or right — it’s to the right of the Play and Fast Forward buttons.
 
5. To eject the disc and load another audio CD, press Ô+E, click the Eject 
icon next to the CD entry in the Source list, or click Controls➪Eject Disc.
 
6. To exit iTunes, press Ô+Q.
 
The first time that you run iTunes, you’re asked to configure the program 
and specify whether Mac OS X should automatically connect to the Internet 
to download the track titles for the disc you’ve loaded. I recommend that 
you accept all the default settings and that you allow automatic connection. 
Is simple, no?
Recording — nay, burning — a data CD
Mac OS X offers a built-in CD recording feature that allows you to burn the 
simplest form of CD: a standard data CD-ROM that can hold up to approxi-
mately 660MB of files and folders, and can be read on both Macs and PCs 
running Windows, UNIX, and Linux. (To burn an audio CD, use iTunes, as I 
show you in Book III, Chapter 2.) Naturally, you’ll need a Mac with a CD or 
DVD recorder.
Need to install a font in Mac OS X, or perhaps 
you’d like to organize your fonts into collections 
based on their theme or their designer? If so, 
you’re talking about Font Book, which is the 
font organizer that ships with Snow Leopard. 
To open Font Book, visit your Applications 
folder and double-click the Font Book icon.
Press Ô+O (or choose File➪Add Fonts) to 
import a new font into your system, or simply 
drag the font file from a Finder window into the 
Font Book window. Snow Leopard can accept 
TrueType, OpenType, and PostScript Type 1 
fonts. When it’s been added, your new font 
can be categorized by dragging it into one of 
your collections, thus making that font easier 
to locate and display. Individual fonts and 
entire collections can be enabled or disabled 
(by using the Enable and Disable items on the 
Edit menu) so that you can “turn on” only those 
fonts that you need for a specific application 
or project. The Font Book window also comes 
fully equipped with a Search box, so you can 
find any font by name.

Back to the story! To record a disc, follow these steps:
 
1. Load a blank CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, or DVD-RW into your drive.
 
 I assume for this demonstration that you’re using a write-once CD-R.
 
2. A dialog appears and prompts you for an action to take. Choose the 
default, Open Finder, for this demonstration.
 
 Mac OS X displays an Untitled CD volume icon on your Desktop. (It’s 
marked with the letters CDR so you know that the disc is recordable.)
 
3. Double-click the Untitled CD icon to display the contents — it’ll be 
empty, naturally.
 
4. Click and drag files and folders to the CD window as you normally do.
 
5. Rename any files or folders as necessary — remember, after you’ve 
started recording, this stuff is etched in stone, so your disc window 
should look just like the volume window should look on the finished 
CD-ROM.
 
6. Click File on the Finder menu and choose Burn Disc, or click the Burn 
button in the CD window.
 
 The Big X displays a confirmation dialog.
 
7. If you’ve forgotten something, you can click the Cancel or Eject button. 
Otherwise, click the Burn button and sit back and watch the fun.
 
Unfortunately, Mac OS X doesn’t support recording from the Finder for some 
external and third-party drives available for the Macintosh. If you can’t burn 
from the Finder (or you’re willing to pay for extra features), I recommend 
that you buy a copy of Roxio Toast Titanium recording software (www.
roxio.com).
All You Really Need to Know about Printing
To close out this chapter, I turn the attention to another task that most Mac 
owners need to tackle soon after buying a Mac or installing Snow Leopard: 
printing documents. Because basic printing is so important (and in most 
cases, so simple), allow me to use this final section to demonstrate how to 
print a document.
Most of us have a Universal Serial Bus (USB) printer — the USB being the 
favored hardware connection within Mac OS X — so as long as your printer 
is supported by Mac OS X, setting it up is as easy as plugging it into one of 
your Mac’s USB ports. The Big X does the rest of the work, selecting the 
proper printer software driver from the Library/Printers folder and setting 
your printer as the default power of the universe.

Before you print, preview! Would you jump from an airplane without a para-
chute? Then why would you print a document without double-checking it 
first? Click Preview, and Mac OS X opens the Preview application to show 
you what the printed document will look like. (Once again, some upstart pro-
grams have their own built-in Print Preview mode thumbnails within the 
Print dialog.) When you’re done examining your handiwork, close the 
Preview application to return to your document.
To print from within any application using the default page characteristics — 
standard 81/3-x-11 inch paper, portrait mode, no scaling — follow these steps:
 
1. Within your application, click File and choose Print — or press the 
Ô+P keyboard shortcut.
 
 Mac OS X displays the simple version of the Print dialog. (To display 
all the fields that you see in Figure 3-9, click the button with the down 
arrow next to the Printer pop-up menu.)
 
 Some applications use their own custom Print dialogs, but you should 
see the same general settings.
 
2. Click in the Copies field and enter the number of copies that 
you need.
 
 You can also enable or disable collation, just as you can with those oh-
so-fancy copiers.

3. Decide what you want to print.
 
• The whole shootin’ match: To print the entire document, use the 
default Pages radio button setting of All.
 
• Anything less: To print a range of selected pages, select the From 
radio button and enter the starting and ending pages.
 
4. (Optional) Choose application-specific printing parameters.
 
 Each Mac OS X application provides different panes so that you can 
configure settings specific to that application. You don’t have to display 
any of these extra settings to print a default document, but the power 
is there to change the look dramatically when necessary. To display 
these settings, click the pop-up menu in the center of the Print dialog 
and choose one of these panes. For example, if you’re printing from the 
Address Book, you can choose the Address Book entry from the pop-up 
menu and elect to print a phone list or an e-mail list.
 
5. When everything is go for launch, click the Print button.
Of course, there are more settings and more functionality to the printing system 
within Mac OS X, and I cover more complex printing topics in much more detail 
in Book VII, Chapter 4. However, I can tell you from my experiences as a 
consultant and hardware technician that this short introduction to printing 
will likely suffice for 90 percent of the Mac owners on Earth. ’Nuff said.

S
potlight is Apple’s desktop search technology that you can use to find 
anything on your computer as quickly as you can type. (Yep, that 
includes all the documents, Address Book contacts, Mail messages, folders, 
and drives that your Mac can access.) In fact, the version of Spotlight 
included with Snow Leopard can even search other Macs across your 
network! Yes, you read right: If the information is on a Mac’s hard drive, a 
CD, your network, or even another Mac in your network, consider it located.
This chapter is your ticket to using this new search technology like a 
professional techno-wizard from day one. I discuss how Spotlight works 
and how you can use it to locate exactly what you want (and present those 
results as proudly as a wine steward showing off a fine vintage).
Basic Searching 101
Figure 4-1 illustrates the Spotlight search field, which is always available 
from the Finder menu bar. Click the magnifying glass icon once (or press 
Ô+Spacebar), and the Spotlight search box appears.
 
Figure 4-1: 
A lot of 
power is 
behind 
this single

search box.
 

80
Basic Searching 101
To run a search, simply click in the Spotlight box and begin typing. You 
see matching items appear as soon as you type, and the search results are 
continually refined while you type the rest of your search criteria. As with 
the Search box in earlier Finder window toolbars, you don’t need to press 
Return to begin the search.
The results of your Spotlight search are presented in the Spotlight menu, 
which is updated automatically in real time while you continue to type. The 
top 20 most-relevant items are grouped into categories right on the Spotlight 
menu, including Messages, Definitions, Documents, Folders, Images, 
Contacts, and so on. Spotlight takes a guess at the item that’s most likely 
the match you’re looking for (based on your Search Results list in System 
Preferences, which I cover later in the chapter) and presents it in the special 
Top Hit category that always appears first.
 
To open the Top Hit item like a true Snow Leopard power user, just press 
Return. (My brothers and sisters, it just doesn’t get any easier than that.)
Literally any text string is acceptable as a Spotlight search. However, here’s 
a short list of the common search criteria I use every day:
 
✦ Names and addresses: Because Spotlight has access to Snow Leopard’s 
Address Book, you can immediately display contact information using 
any portion of a name or address.
 
✦ E-mail message text: Need to open a specific e-mail message, but you’d 
rather not launch Mail and spend time digging through the message list? 
Enter the person’s e-mail address or any text string contained in the 
message you’re looking for.
 
✦ File and folder names: This is the classic search favorite. Spotlight 
searches your entire system for that one file or folder in the blink of an eye.
 
✦ Events & To Do items: Yep, Spotlight gives you access to your iCal 
calendars and those all-important To Do lists you’ve created.
 
✦ System Preferences: Now things start to get really interesting! Try typing 
the word background in the Spotlight field. Some of the results will 
actually be System Preference panes! That’s right, every setting in System 
Preferences is referenced in Spotlight. (For example, the Software Update 
pane contains the word background while the desktop background setting 
is on the Desktop & Screen Saver pane in System Preferences.)
 
✦ Web pages: Whoa. Stand back, Google. You can use Spotlight to search 
the Web pages you’ve recently displayed in Safari! (Note, however, that 
this feature doesn’t let you search through all the Internet as Google 
does . . . only the pages stored in your Safari Web cache and any HTML 
files you’ve saved to your Mac’s hard drive.)

Book I
Chapter 4
Searching 
Everything with 
Spotlight
81
Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
 
✦ Metadata: That’s a pretty broad category, but it fits. For example, I like 
to locate Word documents on my system using the same metadata that’s 
stored in the file, such as the contents of the Comments field in a Word 
document. Other supported applications include Adobe Photoshop 
images, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, Keynote presentations, and other 
third-party applications that offer a Spotlight plug-in.
To reset the Spotlight search and try another text string, click the X icon 
that appears at the right side of the Spotlight box. (Of course, you can also 
backspace to the beginning of the field, but that’s a little less elegant.)
After you find the item that you’re looking for, you can click it once to
 
✦ Launch it (if the item is an application)
 
✦ Open it in System Preferences (if it’s a setting or description on a 
Preferences pane)
 
✦ Open it within the associated application (if the item is a document or a 
data item)
 
✦ Display it within a Finder window (if the item is a folder)
 
Here’s another favorite timesaver: You can display all the files of a particular 
type on your system by using the file type as the keyword. For example, 
to provide a list of all images on your system, just use images as your 
keyword — the same goes for movies and audio, too.
In fact, you can display the same search results from the Snow Leopard 
Sidebar, which includes a Search For heading! You can display All Images, 
All Movies, and All Documents with a single click of your mouse button, from 
any Finder window.
Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
Don’t get fooled into simply using Spotlight as another file-’n’-folder-name 
search tool. Sure, it can do that, but Spotlight can also search inside PDF and 
HTML files, finding matching text that doesn’t appear in the name of the file! 
To wit: A search for Snow Leopard on my system pulls up all sorts of items 
with Snow Leopard in their names, but also files with Snow Leopard in them:
 
✦ Apple Store SF.ppt: A PowerPoint presentation that contains several 
slides containing the text Snow Leopard
 
✦ bk01ch03.doc: A rather cryptically named Microsoft Word file chapter of 
this book that mentions Snow Leopard in several spots
 
✦ Conference Call with Bob: An iCal event pointing to a conference call with 
my editor about upcoming Snow Leopard book projects

82
Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
Notice that not one of these three examples actually has the words Snow 
Leopard occurring anywhere in the title or filename, yet Spotlight found 
them because they all contain the text Snow Leopard therein. That, dear 
reader, is the true power of Spotlight, and how it can literally guarantee 
you that you’ll never lose another piece of information in the hundreds of 
thousands of files and folders on your hard drive!
Heck, suppose that all you remember about a file is that you received it in 
your mail last week or last month. To find it, you can actually type in time 
periods, such as yesterday, last week, or last month, to see every item that 
you saved or received within that period. (Boy, howdy, I love writing about 
truly good ideas.)
 
Again, the Sidebar also allows you to search for files by time period, using 
the links under the Search For heading.
Be careful, however, when you’re considering a search string. Don’t forget 
that (by default) Spotlight matches only those items that have all the 
words you enter in the Spotlight box. To return the highest number of 
possible matches, use the fewest number of words that will identify the item; 
for example, use horse rather than horse image, and you’re certain to be 
rewarded with more hits. (On the other hand, if you’re looking specifically 
for a picture of a knight on horseback, a series of keywords, such as horse 
knight image, shortens your search considerably. It all depends on what 
you’re looking for and how widely you want to cast your Spotlight net.)
So how about all those files, folders, contacts, 
and events that you don’t want to appear in 
Spotlight? What if you’re sharing your Mac as 
a multiuser computer or accessing other Macs 
remotely? Can others search for and access 
your personal information through Spotlight?
Definitely not! The results displayed by 
Spotlight are controlled by file and folder 
permissions as well as your account login, 
just as the applications that create and 
display your personal data are. For example, 
you can’t access other users’ calendars using 
iCal, and they can’t see your Mail messages. 
Only you have access to your data, and only 
after you’ve logged in with your username and 
password. Spotlight works the same way. If a 
user doesn’t normally have access to an item, 
the item simply doesn’t appear when that user 
performs a Spotlight search. (In other words, 
only you get to see your stuff.)
However, you can even hide certain folders 
and disks from your own Spotlight searches if 
necessary. Check out the final section of this 
chapter for details on setting private locations 
on your system.

Expanding Your Search Horizons
To allow greater flexibility in searches, Apple also includes those helpful 
Boolean friends that you may already be familiar with: AND, OR, and NOT. For 
example, you can perform Spotlight searches, such as
 
✦ Horse AND cow (which collects all references to both those barnyard 
animals into one search)
 
✦ Batman OR Robin (which returns all references to either Batman or 
Robin, but not both)
 
✦ Apple NOT PC (which displays all references to Apple that don’t include 
any information on dastardly PCs)
 
Because Spotlight functions are a core technology of Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard — in other words, all sorts of applications can make use of 
Spotlight throughout the operating system, including the Finder — the 
Finder window’s Search box now shares many of the capabilities of 
Spotlight. In fact, you can use the time period trick that I mention earlier 
(entering yesterday as a keyword) in the Finder window Search box.
 
Okay, parents, listen closely: Here’s a (somewhat sneaky) tip that might help 
you monitor your kid’s computer time as well as what your kids are typing/
reading in iChat:
 
1. Enable the iChat transcript feature.
 
a. From within iChat, choose iChat➪Preferences.
 
b. Click Messages.
 
c. Select the Save Chat Transcripts To check box and choose a destination 
folder in a location you can access.
 
2. Click OK to return to iChat.
 
 Now you can use Spotlight to search for questionable words, phrases, 
and names within those iChat transcripts. (For more on iChat, turn to 
Book V, Chapter 3.)
Expanding Your Search Horizons
I can just hear the announcer’s voice now: “But wait, there’s more! If you 
click the Show All menu item at the beginning of your search results, 
we’ll expand your Spotlight menu into the Spotlight Results window!” 
(Fortunately, you don’t have to buy some ridiculous household doodad.)
 
Keyboard mavens will appreciate the Spotlight window shortcut key, and I 
show you where to specify this shortcut in the final section of this chapter.

Expanding Your Search Horizons
Figure 4-2 illustrates the Results window (which is actually a Finder window 
with extras). To further filter the search, click one of the buttons on the 
Spotlight Results window toolbar or create your own custom filter. Click the 
button with the plus sign to display the search criteria bar and then click 
the pop-up menus to choose from criteria, such as the type of file, the text 
content, or the location on your system (for example, your hard drive, your 
Home folder, or a network server). You can also filter your results listing by 
the date the items were created or last saved. To add or delete criteria, click 
the plus and minus buttons at the right side of the search criteria bar. To 
save a custom filter that you’ve created, click the Save button.
 
Figure 4-2:

Images appear as thumbnail icons, so you can use that most sophisticated 
search tool — the human eye — to find the picture you’re looking for. (If you 
don’t see thumbnail images, click the Icon view button on the toolbar.) Don’t 
forget that you can increase or decrease the size of the icons by dragging the 
slider at the bottom right of the window.
 
To display the contents item in the list (without leaving the comfortable 
confines of the Results window), click the icon to select it and click the 
Quick Look icon in the toolbar (or press the spacebar) for a better view.
Again, when you’re ready to open an item, just double-click it in the Results 
window.
As I mention earlier, Spotlight can look for matching items on other Macs on 
your network — but only if those remote Macs are configured correctly. To 
allow another Mac running Mac OS X Tiger, Leopard, or Snow Leopard to be 
visible to Spotlight on your system, enable File Sharing on the other Mac. 
(Oh, and remember that you need an admin-level account on that Mac — or 
access to a good friend who has an admin-level account on that Mac.)

Customizing Spotlight to Your Taste
Follow these steps to enable File Sharing on the other Mac:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing pane.
 
3. Select the On check box next to the File Sharing item in the service 
list to enable it.
 
4. Click the Close button on the System Preferences window.
Remember, you can search only items that you have rights and permissions 
to view on the remote Mac (such as the contents of the Public folders on 
that computer). I discuss more about these limitations earlier in this chap-
ter, in the “Is Spotlight secure?” sidebar.
Customizing Spotlight to Your Taste
You might wonder whether such an awesome Mac OS X feature has its 
own pane within System Preferences — and you’d be right again. Figure 4-3 
shows off the Spotlight pane within System Preferences: Click the System 
Preferences icon (look for the gears) in the Dock and then click the Spotlight 
icon (under Personal) to display these settings.

Customizing Spotlight to Your Taste
Click the Search Results tab to
 
✦ Determine which categories appear in the Spotlight menu and Results 
window. For example, if you don’t use any presentation software on 
your Mac, you can clear the check box next to Presentations to disable 
this category (thereby making more room for other categories that you 
will use).
 
✦ Determine the order that categories appear in the Spotlight menu and 
Results window. Drag the categories to the order in which you want 
them to appear in the Spotlight menu and window. For example, I like 
the Documents and System Preferences categories to appear higher in 
the list because I use them most often.
 
✦ Specify the Spotlight menu and Spotlight Results window keyboard 
shortcuts. You can enable or disable either keyboard shortcut and 
choose the key combination from the pop-up menu.
Click the Privacy tab (as shown in Figure 4-4) to specify disks and folders that 
should never be listed as results in a Spotlight search. I know, I know, I said 
earlier that Spotlight respected your security, and it does. However, the disks 
and folders that you add on this list won’t appear even if you are the one 
performing the search. (This is a great idea for folders and removable hard 
drives that you use to store sensitive information, such as medical records.)
To add locations that you want to keep private, click the Add button 
(bearing a plus sign) and navigate to the desired location. Click the location 
to select it and then click Choose. (Alternatively, you can drag folders or 
disks directly from a Finder window and drop them into the pane.)

Chapter 5: Fun with Photo 
Booth and Front Row
In This Chapter
✓ Using Photo Booth to take photos
✓ Capturing video with iMovie
✓ Working with the Apple Remote
✓ Using Front Row
M
any Apple switchers and first-time owners quickly notice the unusual 
feature that accompanies the latest iMacs and MacBooks: a tiny 
square lens and LED light at the top of the Mac screen. That square is the 
lens of your Mac’s built-in iSight camera, which allows video chatting in 
iChat or a quick, fun series of photos or video clips via Snow Leopard’s 
Photo Booth and iMovie applications — you can even take your user 
account photo with your iSight camera (in the System Preferences window)!
Ah, but there’s more — you can also buy an Apple Remote, which appears 
to be a stick of chewing gum with buttons (or an old-style iPod Shuffle). 
You can use an Apple Remote to control your Mac from the comfort of your 
lounge chair or breakfast nook via Snow Leopard’s Front Row software. 
What’s that you say? Your last computer didn’t have a remote control? 
You’ve never used a computer video camera? Well then, good reader, 
you’ve come to the right place!
In this chapter, I show you how to use your Mac’s remote to dazzle your 
friends and family with all sorts of digital media; then, I demonstrate how 
easy it is to produce photos and video with your iSight camera. Sassy!
Capturing the Moment with iSight and Photo Booth
Does your MacBook or iMac have that tiny lens at the top of the screen? 
Then you’re in business with your built-in iSight camera . . . pat yourself on 
the back and do the Technology dance.
 
If you’re using a Mac mini or Mac Pro, you’re not stuck out in the cold! You 
can still add your own iSight external camera or use a FireWire DV camcorder 
for your Photo Booth input. (Many external USB and FireWire Web cameras 
support Mac OS X as well.) Snow Leopard automatically recognizes 
any supported external video camera.

Capturing the Moment with iSight and Photo Booth
88
Figure 5-1 illustrates a typical MacBook iSight camera. With iChat, you can 
videoconference in style — you’ll find everything you need to join the ranks 
of the iChat elite in Book V, Chapter 3. Photo Booth allows you to snap digi-
tal pictures just as you did in the old automatic photo booth at your local 
arcade, but Photo Book comes complete with visual effects to add pizzazz 
and punch to your photos.

The iSight camera’s indicator light glows green whenever you’re taking a 
snapshot or recording video . . . which, when you think about it, is A Good 
Thing (especially if you prefer chatting at home in Leisure Mode).
 
Need to quickly get a picture of yourself for use on your Web page? Or perhaps 
your iChat icon needs an update to show off your new haircut? Photo Booth 
can capture images at 640 x 480 resolution and 32-bit color — and although 
today’s digital cameras produce a much higher-quality photo, you can’t beat 
the built-in convenience of Photo Booth for that quick snapshot! To snap an 
image in Photo Booth, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch Photo Booth from the Applications folder.
 
 Figure 5-2 illustrates the application window that appears. (Ignore the 
rather silly gentleman who wandered into the frame. I doubt he’ll be in 
your Photo Booth window!)
 
2. (Optional) Click the Effects button to choose an effect you’d like to 
apply to your image.
 
 Photo Booth displays a screen of thumbnail preview images so that you 
can see how each effect changes the photo. You can produce some of 
the simple effects you may be familiar with from Photoshop, such as a 
black-and-white image or a fancy color-pencil filter . . . but it can also 
deliver some mind-blowing distortion effects, and even an Andy Warhol–
style pop-art image!

 To return the display to normal without choosing an effect, click the 
Normal thumbnail, which appears in the center. (Paul Lynde’s spot, for 
those of you old enough to remember “Hollywood Squares.”)
 
 Of course, you can always launch your favorite image editor afterward 
to use a filter or effect on a photo — for example, the effects available 
in iPhoto. Photo Booth can apply these effects automatically as soon as 
you take the picture.
 
3. (Optional) Click a thumbnail to select the desired effect.
 
 When you choose an effect, Photo Booth automatically closes the Effects 
display.
 
4. Click the Camera button.
You’ll notice that the image appears in the film strip at the bottom of the 
window. Photo Booth keeps a copy of all the images you take in the film strip 

Producing Video on the Spot with iMovie

so that you can use them later. After you click a photo in the filmstrip, a 
series of buttons appears, including
 
✦ Sending the photo in an e-mail message
 
✦ Saving the photo directly to iPhoto
 
✦ Using the image as your Snow Leopard user account icon
 
✦ Using the image as your iChat Buddy icon
 
To delete an image from the Photo Booth filmstrip, click the offending photo 
and then click the X button that appears underneath.
Producing Video on the Spot with iMovie
“Mark, am I limited to capturing still images with my Mac’s camera?” Oh, 
pshaw on limitations . . . you’re a Mac owner, after all! You can also use your 
iSight camera to snag video clips (complete with audio) in iMovie.
 
You don’t need an expensive digital camcorder to produce video clips for 
use in iMovie! Your Mac’s camera can capture those clips for you — think of 
the party possibilities! (Or the opportunity for practical jokes. But then 
again, you’re not that kind of person, now, are you?) To capture video 
directly from your iSight camera into iMovie, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch iMovie from the Dock or from the Applications folder.
 
2. Click the Open Camera Import Window button to switch to Import 
Video mode.
 
 In case you haven’t used it yet, the button is located at the far left of the 
toolbar running down the center of the iMovie window, and it sports a 
camera icon.
 
3. Click the Camera pop-up menu at the bottom of the Import window 
and click Built-in iSight.
 
4. When you’re ready to start recording video, click the Capture button.
 
 iMovie displays a sheet allowing you to select the location for the movie 
clip (including the approximate amount of time you can record). You 
can also choose to add the video to an existing iMovie Event or a brand-
new Event. To help keep things steady in your clip, click the Analyze for 
Stabilization after Import check box to enable it — but note that the sta-
bilization process will significantly add to the time it takes for iMovie to 
save your clip to disk.

5. When you’re ready to start recording video, click the Capture button.
 
 iMovie automatically displays the incoming video in the monitor window 
while it’s recorded. (As you might expect, the goofy behavior on the part 
of the distinguished cast usually starts at about this moment.)
 
6. Click the Stop button to stop recording.
 
 After you’ve ended the recording, iMovie creates the video clip and adds 
it to your Clips pane.
I go into much more detail on iMovie in Chapter 4 of Book III, but that’s the 
gist of recording video clips.
Controlling Your Mac Remotely with Front Row
Okay, you’ve seen some neat stuff so far, but things get really cool about now! 
With Apple’s Front Row software, you can turn your Mac into a multimedia 
presentation center that can show off all your digital media to your adoring 
public (and friends and family to boot). In fact, with the Apple Remote, you 
don’t even have to leave the comfort of the couch to start the show.
The Front Row application performs four different functions:
 
✦ Watching DVD movies with DVD Player: If you already loaded a DVD 
into your optical drive, you can watch it. (Sorry, your Mac doesn’t load 
the DVD for you. I guess some things have to remain manually driven for 
a few years yet.)
 
✦ Viewing photos and slide shows: Front Row calls upon iPhoto so that 
you can see your albums, film rolls, and slideshows.
 
✦ Displaying TV shows, movies, videos, and movie trailers: You can 
choose any video you download from the iTunes Music Store or save to 
your Movies folder. If your Mac has a high-speed broadband connection 
to the Internet, you can also watch movie trailers straight from the Apple 
Web site.
 
✦ Coaxing your favorite music and podcasts from your iTunes library: 
Find your songs and playlists available from Front Row.
All this is accomplished with the awesome infrared Apple Remote you see in 
Figure 5-3. It’s as simple to use as an iPod Shuffle!

Your Apple remote is supported by only a handful of applications at the time 
of this writing — for example, you can’t use it as a presentation aide in 
PowerPoint or as a playback controller in GarageBand. However, it’s a sure 
bet that Apple will continue to add functionality to the Apple remote in the 
future, so check the Apple remote section of Snow Leopard’s online help 
system to keep tabs on what’s happening!

D
o you have a well-thumbed address book stuck in a drawer of your 
office desk? Or do you have a wallet or purse stuffed with sticky notes 
and odd scraps of paper, each of which bears an invaluable e-mail address or 
phone number? If so, you can finally set yourself free and enjoy the “Paperless 
Lifestyle” of the new millennium with the revolutionary new Rauncho Digital 
Address Book! As seen on TV! Only $29.95 — and it doubles as an indestructible 
garden hose! But wait! If you order now, we’ll also send you . . .
Of course, you and I would tune that stuff out as soon as we heard, “As seen
on TV” — but, believe it or not, the Rauncho Digital Address Book does exist 
(after a fashion), and you already have one on your Mac. It’s called the 
Address Book, and in this chapter, I show you how to store and retrieve all 
your contact data, including iChat information, photographs, and much more.
(And before you ask, operators are not standing by.)
Hey, Isn’t the Address Book Just a Part of Mail?
It’s true that in early versions of Mac OS X, Address Book was relegated to 
the minor leagues and usually appeared only when you asked for it within 
Mail. Although it could be run as a separate application, there was no con-
venient route to the Address Book from the Desktop, so most Mac owners 
never launched it as a standalone.

Hey, Isn’t the Address Book Just a Part of Mail?
96
Now, however, the Address Book appears in the limelight, earning a default 
location in the Dock and available whenever you need it. Although the 
Address Book can still walk through a meadow hand-in-hand with Mail, it 
also flirts with other Mac OS X applications and can even handle some basic 
telephony chores all by itself through the use of Services.
Figure 6-1 illustrates the default face of the Address Book, complete with a per-
sonal address card: your own contact information, which you enter within the 
First Use Assistant that I mention in Book I, Chapter 1. This card carries a spe-
cial me tag on your thumbnail image (indicating that it’s your personal card) 
as well as a suave-looking silhouette next to your name in the Name column. 
Other Mac OS X applications use the data in your card to automatically fill out 
your personal information in all sorts of documents. (In Figure 6-1, I added a 
number of well-known friends as well . . . a few TV characters, a composer or 
two. You know the drill.)
Note that when you move your mouse cursor over the Group and Name 
column dividers, the cursor changes to a double arrow. This indicates that 
when you click and drag the divider, you can resize the Group and Name 
columns as well as the display pane on the right. Plus, you can click the two 
buttons at the upper-left corner (underneath the window controls) to hide 
or show the Group and Name columns.

Entering Contact Information
Unless you actually meet and hire a group of DataElves — see the sidebar, 
“I gotta type (or retype) that stuff?” — you have to add contacts to your 
Address Book manually. Allow me to demonstrate here how to create a new 
contact within your Address Book:
 
1. Launch Address Book from the Dock by clicking its icon.
 
 The icon looks like an old-fashioned paper Address Book with an @ 
symbol on the cover.
 
2. Press the Ô+N shortcut to create a new contact. Alternatively, choose 
File➪New Card or click the Add a New Person button at the bottom of 
the Name column.
 
 Address Book displays the template that you see in Figure 6-2, with the 
First name field highlighted and ready for you to type.
 
3. Enter the contact’s first name and press Tab to move to the Last 
name field.
 
4. Continue entering the corresponding information in each field, pressing 
Tab to move through the fields.
 
 If a field isn’t applicable (for example, if a person has no home page), 
just press Tab again to skip it. You can press Return to add extra lines to 
the Address field.
 
Figure 6-2: 
“Hey, I 
don’t know

Click to add a new person

Entering Contact Information
98
 
 When you complete certain fields — such as the Address field — a green 
plus symbol pops up to the left of the field. That’s the Address Book 
telling you that there are additional versions of the field that you can enter 
as well. (Think home and work addresses.) Click this plus sign, and you 
can enter the other version. For example, if you enter an iChat address 
for the contact at home, the plus sign appears; click it and then you can 
enter the contact’s work iChat address, too.
 
 You can also add new fields to a card, such as Web addresses, birthdays, 
maiden names, and the like. To add a new field, click Card➪Add Field 
and choose the field you want to add from the menu that appears.
 
5. To add a photograph to the card, click Card➪Choose Custom Image 
(or drag an image from a Finder window on top of the thumbnail 
square).
 
 Address Book displays a sheet that you can use to select the image. 
Click Choose to display our old friend the Open dialog.
 
 If your Mac has an iSight camera, you can click the Capture a picture 
from a video camera button (which bears a snazzy camera icon).
 
6. When you’re done, click the Edit button (bottom center) to save 
the card.
You can edit the contents of a card at any time by displaying it and clicking 
the Edit button at the bottom (or by pressing Ô+L, or even by clicking Edit 
and choosing the Edit Card menu item).
 
No need to edit a card to add information to the Note field — just click 
and type.
You can also add contact cards directly to your Address Book from the Mac 
OS X Mail application — go figure. Within Mail, click the message (to high-
light it) from the person whom you want to add, click the friendly Message 
menu, and then click Add Sender to Address Book, or press Ô+Y. Naturally, 
adding people this way doesn’t add their supporting information — just 
their name and e-mail address (and, if they used Mail on their end to send 
the message and they have a photo attached to their personal card, their 
photo gets imported as well). Once again, your nimble fingers have to manu-
ally enter the rest. For more on Mail, see Book V, Chapter 2.
 
Don’t forget to add those fax numbers! If you have an internal or external 
analog modem, Snow Leopard can fax from any application — just click File 
and choose Print (or press Ô+P) as you always have, and then click the PDF 
button at the bottom of the Print dialog and choose Fax PDF. Mac OS X auto-
matically fills in the address for you, but only if the contact has a fax number 
entered as part of the contact card.

If someone sends you a vCard (look for an attachment with a .vcf extension), 
consider yourself lucky. Just drag the vCard from the attachment window 
in Mail and drop it in your Address Book; any information that the person 
wants you to have is added automatically!
To delete a card, click the unlucky name to display the card, click Edit, and 
then choose Delete Card.
Using Contact Information
Okay, after you have your contact information in Address Book, what can 
you actually do with it? Often, all you really need is a quick glance at an 
address. To display the card for any contact within Address Book, just click 
the desired entry in the Name column. You can move to the next and previ-
ous cards by using the up- and down-arrow keys on your keyboard. (Oh, 
and don’t forget that you can right-click many items within a card to display 
menu commands specific to those items.)
In my two-and-a-half decades of travel through 
the personal computing world, I’ve noticed 
one lovely recurring fantasy shared by com-
puter users that keeps cropping up over and 
over: I call it the DataElf Phenomenon. You see, 
DataElves are the hard-working, silicon-based 
gnomes in tiny green suspenders who magi-
cally enter all the information that you want to 
track into your database (or Address Book, or 
Quicken, or whatever). They burrow into your 
papers and presto! — out pops all that data, 
neatly typed and . . . whoa, Nellie! Let’s stop 
there.
For some reason, computer users seem to forget 
that there are no DataElves. I wish I had a dime 
for every time I’ve heard a heartbroken computer 
user say, “You mean I have to type all that stuff 
in?” (My usual retort is, “Affirmative . . . unless 
you want to pay me a hideous amount to do it for 
you.”) Make no mistake — adding a lifetime’s 
worth of contact information into your Address 
Book can be several hours of monotonous and 
mind-bendingly boring work, which is another 
reason that many computer owners still depend 
on paper to store all those addresses. But take 
my word for it, dear reader, your effort is worth 
it — the next time that you sit down to prepare 
a batch of Christmas cards or you have to find 
Uncle Milton’s telephone number in a hurry, 
you will appreciate the effort that you made 
to enter contact information into your Address 
Book. (Just make sure that you — say it with 
me — back up your hard drive.)
By the way, if you’ve already entered contact 
information into another PIM (short for Personal 
Information Manager), you can reuse that data 
without retyping everything — that is, as long 
as your old program can export contacts in 
vCard format. After you export the records, just 
drag the vCards into the Address Book window 
to add them, or import them by pressing Ô+I. 
(More on this at the end of this chapter.)
“I gotta type (or retype) that stuff?”

Using Contact Information
100
But wait, there’s more! You can also
 
✦ Copy and paste. The old favorites are still around. You can copy any 
data from a card (press Ô+C) and paste it into another open application 
(press Ô+V).
 
✦ Visit a contact’s home page. Click the contact entry to select it, and 
click the page link displayed within the card. Safari dutifully answers the 
call, and next thing you know, you’re online and at the home page speci-
fied in the entry.
 
✦ Send an e-mail message. If you’ve already read through Chapter 3 of 
this minibook, you’ll remember the Mac OS X services feature that I tell 
you about. Click and drag to select any e-mail address on a card; then 
click the Address Book menu, click the Services menu, and choose Send 
To. Bingo! Depending on the information that you select, other services 
might also be available.
 
✦ Add an iChat buddy. From within iChat, click the Buddies menu and 
then click Add a Buddy. From the dialog that appears, you can select a 
contact card that has an Instant Messenger address and add it to your 
Buddy List.
 
✦ Export contacts. From within the Address Book, select the contacts that 
you want to export, click File, and then choose Export vCards from the 
Export pop-up menu. Address Book displays a Save sheet. Navigate to 
the location where you want to save the cards and click Save.
 
✦ Search amongst your contacts. If you’re searching for a specific person 
and all you have is a phone number or a fragment of an address, click in 
the Search field at the top right of the Address Book window and type 
the text. While you continue to enter characters, Address Book shows 
you how many contacts contain matching characters and displays just 
those entries in the Name column. Now that’s sassy! (And convenient. 
And fast as all get-out.) Check out Figure 6-3, where many of the charac-
ters from my favorite TV shows are gathered — note that a number of 
very familiar folks share the same address in Gotham City, and I found 
them by using the Search field.
 
Speaking of searching using a contact in the Address Book, Spotlight is also 
at your beck and call — click a contact to select it; then click the Edit menu 
and choose Spotlight. Whoosh! Snow Leopard searches your entire system 
for everything related to that contact and displays it in the familiar Spotlight 
window.

Arranging Your Contact Cards
Address Book also provides you with a method of organizing your cards into 
groups. A group usually consists of folks with a common link, such as your 
family, friends, co-workers, and others who enjoy yodeling. For example, you 
could set up a Cell Phone group that you can use when syncing data with 
your Bluetooth cell phone.
To create a group, choose File➪New Group or press Ô+Shift+N. (Using the 
Hollywood method, click the plus-sign button at the bottom of the Group 
column.) Address Book creates a new entry in the Group column, with a 
highlighted text box so that you can type the group name. After you type the 
group name, press Return to save it, and then click and drag the entries that 
you want to add to the New Group icon.
 
If you already selected the entries for those contacts that you want to add to 
the group, choose File➪New Group from Selection instead. This saves you a 
step because the group is created and the members are added automatically.
After you create a New Group, you can instantly display members of that 
group by clicking its icon in the Group column. To return to the display of all 
your contacts, click the All Group button.

Using Network Directories
102
 
To further organize your groups, you can drag and drop a group on top of 
another group. It becomes a subgroup, which is handy for things like branch 
offices within your company or perhaps relatives to whom you’re not 
speaking at the moment.
Need an even harder-working group? Create a Smart Group, which — get this — 
automatically adds new contacts you create to the proper group, depending 
on the criteria you specify! To create a Smart Group, follow these steps:
 
1. Click File and click New Smart Group.
 
2. Type a name for the new Smart Group.
 
3. Click the Card pop-up menu and choose the item that will trigger the 
action.
 
 For example, you can choose to automate a Smart Group according to 
the contents of each new card, a company name, or a particular city or 
state.
 
4. Click the Contains pop-up menu and choose the criteria for the item.
 
 An item might contain (or not contain) a specific string of characters, or 
it might have changed in a certain amount of time. To illustrate, one of 
my hardest-working Smart Groups automatically checks the Company 
field in every new card for my publisher’s company name and adds that 
contact card to my Wiley Publishing group if a match occurs.
 
5. To add another criteria line, click the button with the plus sign at the 
end of the first text field.
 
 If you decide you have one criteria line too many, click the button with 
the minus sign next to the offending rule.
 
6. After your Smart Group criteria are correct, click OK.
 
 The Smart Group name appears in your group list. Voilà!
 
Here’s another handy feature of an Address Book group: You can send all 
the members of a group the same e-mail message at one time. Within Mail, 
simply enter the Group name in the To field in the Compose window, and the 
same message is sent to everyone. Even Gandalf couldn’t do that (but my 
copy editor bets that Dumbledore could).
Using Network Directories
I know, I know, I said earlier that you’d have to enter all your contacts 
yourself — but I was talking about your personal contacts! You can also 
access three types of external directories from within Address Book:
 
✦ Mac users working in a Windows network environment can use 
Exchange 2007 network directories.

Book I
Chapter 6
Keeping Track with
 the Address Book
Using Network Directories
103
 
✦ If you’re a member of a company NetInfo network — and if you don’t 
know, ask your wizened network administrator — you can search net-
work directory servers from within Address Book. These servers are 
available automatically, so no configuration is necessary. Sweet.
 
✦ You can search Internet-based LDAP directories. Sorry, folks, I know 
that’s pretty cryptic, but others have written entire books on this 
technology. Again, suffice it to say that your network guru can tell you 
whether LDAP servers are available to you. (In another blazing display 
of techno-nerd acronym addiction, LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory 
Access Protocol.) With LDAP, you can search a central company direc-
tory from anywhere in the world as long as you have an Internet con-
nection. To configure this feature, click Address Book from the menu 
and choose Preferences; click the LDAP tab and then click the + (plus 
sign) button to enter the specific settings for the server that you want 
to access. Your network administrator or the LDAP server administrator 
can supply you with these settings.
To search any network directory, you need to create a corresponding direc-
tory account. Follow these steps to add a directory account:
 
1. Click Address Book➪Preferences to display the Preferences window.
 
2. Click the Add button to launch the Add Account assistant.
 
3. Click the Account Type pop-up menu to choose the desired species of 
network directory.
 
 Type the required information in the fields that appear. (Your network 
administrator should be able to provide you with the necessary values.)
 
4. Click Create.
 
 You’ll see the blue network directory entry appear in the Group column.
The rest is easy! Click the Directories entry in the Group column and use the 
Search field as you normally would. Matching entries display the person’s 
name, e-mail address, and phone number.
 
“But hey, Mark, what if I’m not online? My company’s LDAP directory isn’t 
much good then, right?” Normally, that’s true. If you’re a mobile user, LDAP 
information is available to you only when you’re online and the LDAP server 
is available. Ah, but here’s a rocking power user tip that’ll do the trick for 
MacBook owners: To make a person’s information always available, search 
the LDAP database and drag the resulting entry from the Directories window 
to the All group. You’ll import the information to your local Address Book — 
and you’ll see it even when you’re not online!

Printing Contacts with Flair
104
Printing Contacts with Flair
Consider how to print your contacts (for those moments when you need an 
archaic hard copy). Address Book offers two different formats.
 
By default, Address Book prints on standard U.S. letter-size paper (8½ x 11 
inches) in portrait orientation. You can change these settings right from the 
Print dialog: Choose File and click Print or press Ô+P. From the Print dialog, 
you can choose exotic settings, such as legal-size paper or landscape 
orientation.
Follow these steps to print your contacts:
 
1. Press Ô+P.
 
 Address Book displays the Print dialog. To show all the settings, click 
the Expand button next to the Printer field, which carries a downward-
pointing triangle.
 
 If you need more than one copy, click in the Copies field to specify the 
desired number.
 
 Need labels? We’ve got ’em! Click the Style pop-up menu and choose 
Mailing Labels to specify what type of label stock you’re using on the 
Layout panel. Click the Label button to sort your labels by name or 
postal code, choose a font, select a text color, and add an icon or image 
to your labels. To switch back to a standard contact list, click Style again 
and then click Lists. (You can also print envelopes and pocket address 
book pages in a similar manner — just choose the desired entry from 
the Style pop-up menu.)
 
2. Select the desired Attributes check boxes to specify which contact 
card fields you want to appear in your list.
 
 The Attributes list appears only if you’re printing contacts in Lists style.
 
3. Click the Print button to send the job to the selected printer.
 
 Alternatively, you can create a PDF file in a specified location — a handy 
trick to use if you’d rather not be burdened with paper, but you still 
need to consult the list or give it to others. (PDF files are a special docu-
ment display format developed by Adobe; they display like a printed 
document but take up minimal space.) To display the contents of a PDF 
file in Mac OS X, you need only double-click it in the Finder window, and 
the built-in Preview application is happy to oblige.

Swapping Bytes with vCards
105
Swapping Bytes with vCards
A vCard is a standard file format for exchanging contacts between programs 
such as Address Book, Microsoft Entourage, Eudora, and the Palm computer 
desktop. (Heck, if you’re lucky enough to have an iPod, you can even store 
vCard data there.) Think of a vCard as an electronic business card that you 
can attach to an e-mail message, send via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or 
exchange with others by using your cellular phone and palmtop computer. 
vCard files end with the extension .vcf.
In Address Book, you can create a single vCard containing one or more 
selected entries by choosing File➪Export and choosing Export vCard. Then, 
as with any other Mac OS X Save dialog, just navigate to the spot where you 
want the file saved, give it a name, and click Save.
To import vCards into Address Book
 
✦ Drag the vCard files that you’ve received to Address Book and drop 
them in the application window.
 
✦ Alternatively, choose File➪Import (or press Ô+O). From the Open 
dialog, navigate to the location of the vCard files that you want to add, 
select them, and then click Open.

In This Chapter
✓ Deleting applications
✓ Using Apple System Profiler
✓ Using Activity Monitor and Disk Utility
✓ Updating Mac OS X and your drivers
✓ Backing up your system
✓ Using a disk defragmenter and start-up keys
T
he title of this chapter really sounds like a contradiction in terms, 
doesn’t it? The concepts of joy and maintenance are likely mutually 
exclusive to you — and it’s true that most Mac OS X owners would rather 
work or play than spend time under the hood, getting all grimy. I under-
stand completely; maintenance is far less sexy than a game like Prey or even 
an exciting productivity application like Pages.
However, if you do want to work or play uninterrupted by lockups and 
crashes — yes, believe it or not, the Big X can indeed take a dive if it’s not 
cared for — and you’d like your Mac to perform like Lance Armstrong, you 
have to get your hands dirty. That means performing regular maintenance 
on your hardware, Mac OS X, and your all-important applications, 
documents, and folders.
As do most techno-types, I actually enjoy pushing my system to the limit and 
keeping it running in top form. And who knows — after you become a Snow 
Leopard power user, you could find yourself bitten by the maintenance bug 
as well. In this chapter, I cover how to take care of necessary tune-up chores, 
step by step.
Deleting Applications the Common Sense Way
Nothing lasts forever, and that includes your applications. You might no longer 
need an application, or maybe you need to remove it to upgrade to a new ver-
sion or to reinstall it. In contrast to Windows XP and Vista, Mac OS X doesn’t 
have an Add or Remove Programs utility for uninstalling software — nor 

Deleting Applications the Common Sense Way
108
does it need one, because virtually all Macintosh applications are self-contained 
in a single folder or series of nested folders. (And not by accident . . . keeping 
everything related to an application within a single folder has always been 
a rule for Apple software developers since the first days of the Macintosh.) 
Therefore, removing an application is usually as easy as deleting the con-
tents of the installation folder from your hard drive (for example, removing 
the Quicken folder to uninstall Quicken).
 
Always check the application’s README file and documentation for any 
special instructions before you delete any application’s folder! If you’ve 
created any documents in that folder that you want to keep, don’t forget to 
move them before you trash the folder and its contents. In fact, some appli-
cations may come complete with their own uninstall utility, so checking the 
README and documentation may save you unnecessary steps.
 
Some applications can leave preference files, start-up applications, or driver 
files in other spots on your disk besides their home folder. When you’re 
uninstalling a program that has support files in other areas, use the Search 
box in the Finder toolbar to locate other files that might have been created 
by the application. (I cover this feature in Book II, Chapter 1.) Again, don’t 
forget to check whether an application has an uninstall utility (or an unin-
stall option available through the original setup application).
For example, Figure 7-1 illustrates a Spotlight search that I’ve run on 
Microsoft Office 2008. By searching for the word office, I found a number 
of files created in other folders, such as the Settings file that’s in my 
Preferences folder. Typically, you want to delete the main application folder 
and then remove these orphans.

Popping the Hood: Using the System Profiler
109
Spring Cleaning, from Smith Micro ($50; my.smithmicro.com), also has the 
ability to uninstall a program, as well as a feature that can find and remove 
orphaned files left from past applications.
Popping the Hood: Using the System Profiler
Need hard information about your hardware? You might need to determine 
precisely what hardware is installed in your Mac for the following reasons:
 
✦ If you’re working with a technical support person to solve a problem: 
This person will usually request information about your system, such as 
what processor you’re running and how much memory you have.
 
✦ If you’re evaluating an application before you buy it: You’ll want to 
check its minimum system requirements against the hardware on your 
Mac.
 
✦ If you’re considering an upgrade to your Mac: You’ll likely need to 
determine how much memory you have, what type it is, and which 
memory slots are filled. (The same goes for your hard drive and your 
video card, for those Macs with video card slots.) For more on upgrad-
ing your Mac, thumb through Book VII, Chapter 2.
Apple provides Mac OS X with an all-in-one hardware and software display 
tool, aptly named System Profiler, which you can find in the Utilities folder 
within your Applications folder. You can also reach the Profiler through 
the Apple menu (Ú). Just click About This Mac and then click the More Info 
button.
As with the folders in a Finder window in List View mode, you can expand or 
collapse each major heading that appears in a Profiler screen. Just click the 
triangle that appears to the left of each Contents heading to expand or col-
lapse that heading.
The System Profiler major headings include
 
✦ Hardware: This heading tells you volumes about your hard drives — 
forgive me, I couldn’t help that — as well as specifics concerning your 
optical drives; modem; AirPort and Bluetooth hardware; graphics hard-
ware; AC power settings; and any FireWire, eSATA, and USB devices 
connected to your system. Figure 7-2 illustrates the information from 
my USB screen, with many of the devices expanded so that you can see 
them. (The text you see at the bottom half of the window is the detailed 
information on the item that’s selected.)

about your 
Mac’s ports 
and con-
nections.
 
 
✦ Network: This heading shows a listing of your network configuration, 
active network connections, and other assorted network paraphernalia. 
You’ll probably need this screen only when asked by a technical support 
person for the network protocols that you’re using, but it’s handy none-
theless. (You’ll find details on your network connection here that you 
can’t find anywhere else in Snow Leopard.)
 
✦ Software: Okay, this heading shows something useful to the average 
human being! This screen lists all the applications, fonts, and prefer-
ences recognized on your start-up volume, along with their version 
numbers. If you’re wondering whether you need to update an applica-
tion with a patch file (to fix bugs in the software) or update a file from 
the developer, you can look here to check the current version number 
for the application. You also get a rather boring list of the extensions (or 
drivers) used by Mac OS X applications. Logs are usually valuable only 
to tech support personnel; they document recent lockups, application 
crashes, and even system crashes.
Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
Our next stop in Maintenance City is a useful little application dubbed 
Activity Monitor, which is specially designed to show you just how hard your 
CPU, hard drives, network equipment, and memory modules are working 
behind the scenes. To run Activity Monitor, open the Utilities folder in your 
Applications folder.

Chapter 7
The Joys 
of Maintenance
Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
111
To display each different type of usage, click the buttons in the lower half of 
the window; the lower pane changes to reflect the desired type (see Figure 7-3). 
For example, if you click System Memory, you see the amount of unused 
memory; click CPU or Network to display real-time usage of your Mac’s CPU 
and network connections.
 
Figure 7-3: 
Keep tabs 
on Snow 
Leopard and 
what you’re 
running.
 
You can also display a separate window with your CPU usage; choose 
Window➪CPU Usage or press Ô+2. There are three different types of cen-
tral processing unit (CPU, which is commonly called the “brain” of your 
Macintosh) displays available from Activity Monitor:
 
✦ Floating CPU window: This is the smallest display of CPU usage; the 
higher the CPU usage, the higher the reading on the monitor. You can 
arrange the floating window in horizontal or vertical mode from the 
Window menu.
 
✦ CPU Usage window: This is the standard CPU monitoring window, 
which uses a blue thermometer-like display. The display works the same 
as the floating window.
 
✦ CPU History window: This scrolling display uses different colors to help 
indicate the percentage of CPU time being used by your applications 
(green) and what percentage is being used by Snow Leopard to keep 
things running (red). You can use the History window to view CPU usage 
over time.

Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
112
 
Do you have two (or more) bars in your CPU usage monitor? That’s because 
you’re running one of Apple’s multiple-core Intel processors. More than one 
engine is under the hood!
Whichever type of display you choose, you can drag the window anywhere 
that you like on your Mac OS X Desktop. Use the real-time feedback to deter-
mine how well your system CPU is performing when you’re running applica-
tions or performing tasks in Mac OS X. If this meter stays peaked for long 
periods of time while you’re using a range of applications, your processor(s) 
are running at full capacity.
 
You can even monitor CPU, network, hard drive, or memory usage right from 
the Dock! Choose View➪Dock Icon; then choose what type of real-time graph 
you want to display in your Dock. (Feeling like a Snow Leopard power user 
yet? I thought so.) When you’re monitoring CPU usage from the Dock, the 
green portion of the bar indicates the amount of processor time used by 
application software, and the red portion of the bar indicates the CPU time 
given to the Mac OS X operating system (same as how this works in the CPU 
History window).
 
Note, however, that seeing your CPU capacity at its max doesn’t necessarily 
mean that you need a faster CPU or a new computer. For example, when I’m 
running memory-ravenous applications, such as Photoshop or Word, the 
Activity Monitor on my MacBook Pro is often pegged (indicating maximum 
use) for several seconds at a time. The rest of the time, it barely moves. 
Whether a computer is actually fast enough for you and the applications that 
you run is more of a subjective call on your part.
“Mark, what’s that arcane-looking list doing in 
the middle of the Activity Monitor window in 
Figure 7-3?” I’m glad you asked. A process is 
a discrete task (either visible or invisible) that 
Snow Leopard performs in order to run your 
applications. (Some processes are executed 
by Snow Leopard just to keep itself running.) 
For example, the Dock and Finder are actually 
processes, as are Adobe Acrobat and iPhoto.
You can quit a specific process within Activity 
Monitor. Just click the offending process in the 
list and then click the Quit Process button on 
the Activity Monitor toolbar. But tread care-
fully, Mr. Holmes, for there’s danger afoot. For 
example, deleting a system process (such as 
the Dock or Finder) can result in all of Mac OS 
X locking up! Therefore, delete a process only 
if instructed to do so by a support technician. If 
you need to terminate a misbehaving applica-
tion, click the Apple menu and choose Force 
Quit instead.

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
Another important application in your maintenance toolbox is Disk Utility, 
which you find — no surprise here — in the Utilities folder within your 
Applications folder. When you first run this program, it looks something like 
Figure 7-4, displaying all the physical disks and volumes on your system.
 
The Disk Utility application has its own toolbar that you can toggle on and 
off. Click the lozenge-shaped button at the upper-right corner of the window 
to display or hide the toolbar.
 
Figure 7-4: 
The familiar 
face of

Displaying the goods on your disks
The volume tree structure on the left of the Disk Utility window lists both 
the physical disks and the partitions that you’ve set up. A partition is noth-
ing more than another word for volume, which is the formatted section of 
a disk that contains data. A single physical hard drive can contain several 
partitions. The information display at the bottom of the Disk Utility window 
contains data about both the volumes and the partitions on your hard drive.
To illustrate: On my system, clicking the drive labeled 320.07 GB (the physi-
cal hard drive at the top of the tree) displays a description of the drive itself, 
including its total capacity, interface (connection type), and whether the 
drive is internal or external. (See Figure 7-5.)

Clicking the tree entry for Wolfgang, however — that’s the name of the partition 
that I created when I formatted the drive — displays information about the 
type of formatting, the total capacity of the partition and how much of that is 
used, and the number of files and folders stored on the partition (as shown 
at the bottom of Figure 7-6).

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility

Playing doctor with First Aid
From the First Aid pane, you can use Disk Utility to verify (or check) any disk 
(well, almost any disk) for errors, as well as repair any errors that it finds. 
Here are the two exceptions when the buttons are disabled:
 
✦ The start-up disk: Disk Utility can’t repair the start-up disk — that’s Mac 
talk for the boot drive that contains the Mac OS X system you’re using 
at the moment — which makes sense if you think about it, because that 
drive is currently being used!
 
 If you have multiple operating systems on multiple disks, you can boot 
from another Mac OS X installation on another drive to check your cur-
rent start-up disk. Or you can boot your system from the original Mac 
OS X installation DVD and run Disk Utility from the Installation menu.
You might have noticed the New Image button 
on the Disk Utility toolbar (or the image cre-
ation commands on the File➪New submenu). If 
you’re wondering what a disk image is, you’ve 
come to the right place. Think of a disk image 
as a file that looks (and acts) like an external 
storage device within Snow Leopard; for exam-
ple, a mounted disk image operates much like 
a CD or DVD, and it can be ejected just as a 
disc can. Images can be read-only (same as a 
standard CD-ROM or DVD-ROM) or they can be 
created blank (same as an empty hard drive), 
ready to accept files and folders that you copy 
using the Finder.
So what are images used for? They’re great 
for storing data that would normally have to be 
loaded from a CD or DVD (a great convenience 
if you don’t want to lug optical media along with 
you during a vacation). Remember, a disk image 
acts just the same as removable storage media 
as far as Snow Leopard’s concerned. Many 
Mac Web sites also offer images as download 
files because a simple double-click is all that’s 
necessary to automatically mount a disk image. 
(Software developers like words such as fast 
and simple when offering their shareware and 
demo applications to the public.)
Finally, images are often used to create simple 
archives of little-used data: The images can 
be burned to CD/DVD or even copied to other 
hard drives. Oh, and don’t forget the security 
aspect — you can choose to encrypt the data 
stored in an image, protecting it from prying 
eyes. (However, I don’t recommend using 
disk images to create full backups of your 
Mac’s hard drives; more on this in the section 
“Hitching a ride on the Time Machine,” later in 
the chapter.) To restore a disk image, you can 
use the Restore tab in Disk Utility.
If you’re intrigued, I encourage you to click New 
Image on the Disk Utility toolbar (see Figure 7-5) 
and create a simple, unencrypted blank disk 
image on your Desktop. Then you can experi-
ment with it. A disk image can be ejected to 
unmount it (same as with a CD/DVD, an iPod, 
or a USB Flash drive), and you can delete the 
image file at any time. (Just remember not to 
delete it if it contains anything you want to keep, 
of course . . . but you knew that already.)
So what’s a disk image?

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
116
 
✦ Write-protected disks: Although you can use the Disk Utility to verify 
CDs and DVDs, Disk Utility can’t repair them. (Sound of my palm slap-
ping my forehead.)
 
 You usually can’t repair a disk that has open files that are currently 
being used. If you’re running an application from a drive or you’ve 
opened a document that’s stored on that drive, you probably can’t 
repair that drive.
You can also elect to verify and repair permissions (or privileges) on a disk; 
these are the read/write permissions that I discuss in detail in Book II, 
Chapter 6. If you can’t save or move a file that you should be able to access, 
I recommend checking that drive for permissions problems. Although you 
can’t fix disk errors on a boot drive, you can verify and repair permissions 
on any volume that contains a Mac OS X installation (whether it was used to 
boot your Mac or not).
 
In order to verify or repair, you must be logged in as an admin-level user.
To verify or repair a drive, first select the target volume/partition in the 
list at the left. To check the contents of the drive and display any errors, 
click the Verify Disk button. Or, to verify the contents of the drive and fix 
any problems, click the Repair Disk button. (I usually just click Repair Disk 
because an error-free disk needs no repairs.) Disk Utility displays any status 
or error messages in the scrolling list; if you have eagle eyes, you’ll note that 
the window can be resized so that you can expand it to display more mes-
sages. (You can also drag the dot between the left and right panes to expand 
the list.)
I generally check my disks once every two or three days. If your Mac is 
caught by a power failure or Mac OS X locks up, however, it’s a good idea to 
immediately check disks after you restart your Mac. (Don’t forget that the 
start-up volume is automatically checked and repaired, if necessary.)
A number of very good commercial disk repair utilities are on the market. My 
favorite is Drive Genius 2 from Prosoft Engineering ($99; www.prosofteng.
com) — however, Disk Utility does a good job on its own, and it’s free.
Erasing without seriously screwing up
“Danger, Will Robinson! Danger!” That’s right, Robot, it is indeed very easy 
to seriously screw up and get “Lost in Erase.” (Man, I can’t believe I actually 
typed such a bad pun. I have no shame.) Anyway, it’s time for another of 
Mark’s Maxims. To paraphrase the rules for handling a firearm responsibly:
 
Never click the Erase tab unless you mean to use it.

Figure 7-7 illustrates the Erase controls within Disk Utility. You need to erase 
a disk or volume only when you want to completely wipe the contents of that 
existing disk or volume. You can also erase a rewritable CD (CD-RW) or DVD 
(DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or DVD-RAM) from this pane.
 
Figure 7-7: 
The Disk 
Utility Erase 
controls.
 
 
✦ Erasing an entire disk deletes all volumes on the disk and creates a single 
new, empty volume.
 
✦ Erasing a volume wipes only the contents of that specific volume, leaving 
all other volumes on the physical disk untouched.
To erase, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the disk or volume icon that you want to erase from the list on 
the left side of the screen.
 
2. Click the Erase tab.
 
3. Click the format that you want to use from the Format pop-up menu.
 
 Always choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) entry from the Format list 
unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS File System (for com-
patibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX File System (for compat-
ibility with UNIX/Linux machines). In some cases, Disk Utility will force 
you to choose the Mac OS Extended entry instead, but the end result is 
the same. Note that you do not need to format a disk or volume with the 
MS-DOS File System just to read a file from a PC system — Mac OS X rec-
ognizes MS-DOS removable media (such as a USB drive formatted under 
Windows) without a problem.

4. In the Name field, type the name for the volume.
 
 If you’re erasing an existing volume, the default is the existing name.
 
5. If you’re worried about security, click Security Options and specify 
the method you want to use.
 
 By default, this is set to Don’t Erase Data, so Disk Utility doesn’t actually 
overwrite any data while formatting; instead, it simply trashes the exist-
ing directory, rendering that data unreachable. Or is it? With some third-
party disk utilities, some unscrupulous bum could actually recover your 
files if you choose, so you can specify alternative, more secure methods 
of erasing a disk or volume. Unfortunately, these more secure erasure 
methods can take a horrendous amount of time.
 
 Therefore, it’s okay to use the Don’t Erase Data option unless you want 
to make sure that nothing can be recovered, or use the Zero Out Data 
to take a more secure route with the least amount of extra waiting. For 
example, you’d want to use the Zero Out Data option if you’re selling 
your Mac on eBay and you’re formatting the drive for the new owner. 
If you’re really set on the tightest, government-quality security, select 
either 7-Pass Erase or 35-Pass Erase . . . but make sure you have plenty 
of time to spare!
 
 You can even click Erase Free Space to wipe the supposedly “clean” 
areas of your drive before you format. Man, talk about airtight security! 
Again, the Zero Out method is the fastest.
 
6. Click the Erase button.
 
 In the sheet that appears, click Erase to confirm that you do actually 
want to do the deleterious deed.
Partitioning the right way
From time to time, just about everyone wishes he or she had additional vol-
umes handy for organizing files and folders, or at least a little extra space 
on a particular partition. If you find yourself needing another volume on a 
disk — or if you need to resize the total space on existing volumes on a disk — 
click the Partition tab within Disk Utility to display the controls that you see 
in Figure 7-8. (Make sure that you select a disk and not a volume.) From here, 
you can choose a volume scheme, creating anywhere from 1 to 16 volumes on 
a single disk.
 
You can’t monkey around with the partitions on a start-up disk because Mac 
OS X is currently running on that disk. (Think about removing your own 
appendix, and you get the idea.) Also, if you resize an existing volume, you 
may lose files and folders on that volume — Disk Utility prompts you for per-
mission, but it’s always a good idea to back up a partition before you resize it!

To set up the partitions on a disk, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Partition panel within Disk Utility, click the disk icon (left 
side of the pane) that you want to partition.
 
2. Click the Volume Scheme pop-up menu and choose the total number 
of volumes that you want on the selected disk.
 
3. Click the first volume block in the partition list (under the Volume 
Scheme pop-up menu) to select it.
 
 I have two partitions set for this disk, as you can see.
 
4. Click in the Name field and enter the name for the selected volume.
 
5. From the Format pop-up menu, choose a format for the volume.
 
 Always use Mac OS Extended or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the 
Format menu unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS file 
system (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX 
file system (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines).
 
6. Type a total size for this volume in the Size field.
 
7. After you set up your first volume partition, select the Locked for 
Editing check box to prevent any further changes to that volume.
 
8. If you’re creating multiple volumes, click the next volume block to 
select it and repeat Steps 4–7.
 
9. To delete a partition from your new scheme, click the unwanted 
volume and then click the Delete button to remove it.

 If the partition is locked, clear the Locked for Editing check box before 
deleting it.
 10. To split a partition from your new scheme into two volumes, click the 
desired volume and then click the Split button.
 
 Some folks create multiple volumes so that they can boot from multiple 
versions of Snow Leopard — like us author types.
 
 If the partition is locked, clear the Locked for Editing check box before 
splitting it.
 11. After everything is set to your liking, click the Apply button to begin 
the process.
 
 If you suddenly decide against a partition change, click the Revert 
button to return to the original existing partition scheme.
 
 The Revert button is available only before you click the Partition button!
If you have more than one partition, check out the bar(s) with a handle 
separating the volumes in the partition list. If you leave all your partitions 
unlocked (by leaving the Locked for Editing check box disabled), you can 
click and drag these separator bars to dynamically resize the volumes. This 
makes it easy to adjust the individual volume sizes for the disk until you get 
precisely the arrangement you want. If a volume is locked, it can’t be resized 
dynamically in this fashion.
RAID has nothing to do with insects
The next stop on the Disk Utility hayride isn’t for everyone — as a matter of 
fact, only a Mac OS X power user with a roomful of hardware is likely to use 
it. RAID, Redundant Array of Independent/Inexpensive Disks, is actually what 
it says. In normal human English, a RAID set is a group of multiple separate 
disks, working together as a team. RAID can
 
✦ Improve the speed of your system
 
✦ Help prevent disk errors from compromising or corrupting your data
The RAID controls within Disk Utility are illustrated in Figure 7-9. (Note that 
I’ve turned on the Disk Utility toolbar as well, just to show you what it looks 
like.) You need at least two additional hard drives on your system besides 
the start-up disk, which I don’t recommend that you use in a RAID set.
To set up a RAID array in Mac OS X, follow these steps:
 
1. From the RAID tab of Disk Utility, click and drag the disks from the list 
at the left to the Disk box at the right.

Figure 7-9:

2. Click the RAID Type pop-up menu to specify the type of RAID that 
you need.
 
• Striped RAID Set: Choosing this can speed up your hard drive 
performance by splitting data between multiple disks.
 
• Concatenated RAID Set: Choosing this allows several volumes (or 
even multiple disks) to appear as one volume within Snow Leopard.
 
• Mirrored RAID Set: Choosing this increases the reliability of your stor-
age by creating a mirror backup of that data across multiple disks.
 
3. Click in the RAID Set Name field and type the name for your RAID set.
 
4. From the Volume Format pop-up menu, choose a format for the volumes.
 
 Always use Mac OS Extended or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the 
Volume Format list unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS 
File System (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX 
File System (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines). Journaling 
helps reduce the amount of disk fragmentation and also helps speed up 
your hard drive’s performance.
 
5. Click the Create button.

Updating Mac OS X
122
Updating Mac OS X
As any good software developer should, Apple constantly releases improve-
ments to Mac OS X in the form of software updates. These updates can 
include all sorts of fun stuff, like
 
✦ Bug fixes
 
✦ Improvements and new features
 
✦ Enhanced drivers
 
✦ Security upgrades
 
✦ Firmware upgrades
Apple makes it easy to keep Mac OS X up-to-date with the Software Update 
controls in System Preferences.
 
You don’t even have to display the System Preferences window to check for 
new software updates manually. Click the Apple menu in the Finder menu bar 
and then choose Software Update to perform a manual check immediately.
To check for new updates periodically, display the Software Update pane in 
System Preferences and click the Scheduled Check tab. Select the Check for 
Updates check box and choose how often you want these updates from the 
pop-up menu. (I suggest at least weekly, if not daily.) For a manual check, 
make sure that you’re connected to the Internet and then click the Check 
Now button.
To download updates automatically, mark the Download Important Updates 
in the Background check box to enable it; the Big X politely downloads the 
updates behind the scenes and then alerts you that they’re ready to be 
installed. (With automatic downloading disabled, Mac OS X displays any 
available updates with short descriptions, and you can toggle the installa-
tion of a specific update by enabling or disabling the check boxes next to it.)
 
I recommend installing all updates, even for hardware that you don’t have 
yet. For example, I always install AirPort updates even though I don’t use an 
AirPort connection at home. The reason? Often, the functionality covered by 
an update may include system software that you do use, so you still benefit 
from installing it.
After you specify the updates that you want to install, click the Install button 
to begin the update process. You might have to reboot after everything has 
been installed.
To see which updates you’ve installed already, click the Installed Updates 
tab on the Software Update pane in System Preferences.

I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
123
I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
I know we’re friends, but there’s no excuse for not backing up your data. 
The more valuable and irreplaceable your documents are, the more heinous 
it is to risk losing them. (I don’t get to use the word heinous in many of my 
books, but it fits really well here.)
Although Apple does include the ability to create disk images and restore 
them in the Disk Utility (see the “So what’s a disk image?” sidebar, earlier 
in this chapter), I don’t recommend that you use disk images as your com-
prehensive backup solution. (Insert sound of stunned silence here.) That’s 
because the restore process can be confusing, and the disk image method 
doesn’t offer the level of control that you need when it comes to backing up 
individual files and folders (or selectively backing up by date or recent use).
 
If you do create backup datasets using disk images, you can restore them 
from the Restore tab in Disk Utility. You can also restore from a volume — 
typically, a volume you want to restore would be saved on a DVD or an 
external hard drive.
“Okay, Mark, what do I use to back up my valuable data?” Well, good 
citizen, only a bona fide backup application gives you such flexibility 
and convenience . . . and that’s why Snow Leopard power users turn to 
Time Machine, a feature that makes restoring files as easy as pointing and 
clicking!
Hitching a ride on the Time Machine
If you enable backups through Snow Leopard’s Time Machine feature, you 
can literally move backward through the contents of your Mac’s hard drive, 
selecting and restoring all sorts of data. Files and folders are ridiculously 
easy to restore — and I mean easier than any restore you’ve ever performed, 
no matter what the operating system or backup program. Time Machine can 
even handle things like deleted Address Book entries and photos you’ve sent 
to the Trash from iPhoto!
Because Time Machine should be an important and integral part of every 
Mac owner’s existence, the Time Machine icon is included in the Dock. 
(Apple is not messing around!)
 
Before you can use Time Machine, it must be enabled within the Time 
Machine pane in System Preferences. I cover these settings in detail in 
Chapter 3 of Book II. I also recommend that you invest in an external USB or 
FireWire hard drive to hold your Time Machine backups.

I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
124
Here’s how you can turn back time, step-by-step, to restore a file that you 
deleted or replaced in a folder:
 
1. Open the folder that contained the file you want to restore.
 
2. In a separate window, open your Applications folder and launch the 
Time Machine application, or click the Time Machine icon in the 
Dock.
 
 The oh-so-ultra-cool Time Machine background appears behind your 
folder, complete with its own set of buttons at the bottom of the screen 
(as shown in Figure 7-10). On the right, you see a timeline that corre-
sponds to the different days and months included in the backups that 
Snow Leopard has made.
 
3. Click within the timeline to jump directly to a date (displaying the 
folder’s contents on that date).
 
 Alternatively, use the Forward and Back arrows at the right to move 
through the folder’s contents through time. (You should see the faces 
of Windows users when you “riffle” through your folders to locate some-
thing you deleted several weeks ago!)
 
 The backup date of the items you’re viewing appear in the button bar at 
the bottom of the screen.

4. After you locate the file you want to restore, click it to select it.
 
5. Click the Restore button at the right side of the Time Machine button 
bar.
 
 If you want to restore all the contents of the folder, click the Restore All 
button instead.
Time Machine returns you to the Finder, with the newly restored file now 
appearing in the folder. OUTstanding!
 
To restore specific data from your Address Book or images from iPhoto, launch 
the desired application first and then launch Time Machine. Instead of rif-
fling a Finder window, you can move through time within the application 
window.
For simple backup and restore protection, Time Machine is all that a typical 
Mac owner at home is likely to ever need. Therefore, a very easy Mark’s 
Maxim to predict:
 
Connect an external hard drive and turn on Time Machine. Do it now. 
Don’t make a heinous mistake.™
How about that? I got to use heinous twice in one chapter.
Using other backup solutions
Time Machine is indeed awesome, but some Mac owners prefer a more tra-
ditional automated backup and restore process — one that doesn’t involve 
running the Time Machine application and navigating through the files and 
folders on a drive. For example, a person backing up a Mac acting as a Web 
server or iTunes media server would much rather restore the entire con-
tents of a volume automatically, in bulk, or create a custom backup/restore 
schedule that safeguards only certain files and folders.
If you’re dead-set against Time Machine, you can turn to a commercial 
backup application for your salvation — my personal recommendation is 
EMC Retrospect, from EMC (www.retrospect.com). This well-written “soft-
ware bungee cord” has saved my posterior more than once.
 
Using EMC Retrospect is cheap security, but if you can’t afford it at the 
moment, take a second to at least back up your most important documents 
by copying them to a rewriteable CD or a USB flash drive. With this poor 
man’s backup, even if you lose your entire hard drive, you can still restore 
what matters the most.

I Further Demand That You Defragment
126
I Further Demand That You Defragment
Defragmenting your hard drive can significantly improve its performance. 
Using a defragmenter scans for little chunks of a file that are spread out 
across the surface of your hard drive and then arranges them to form a 
contiguous file. After a file has been optimized in this way, it’s far easier and 
faster for Mac OS X to read than reassembling a fragmented file.
However, Apple dropped the ball on this one and didn’t include a defrag-
menter with Mac OS X. Luckily, many third-party disk utilities (such as the 
aforementioned Drive Genius 2 from Prosoft Engineering) also include a 
defragmenting feature. If you have a defragmenter, I recommend that you 
use it once a month.
Special Start-Up Keys for Those Special Times
Mac OS X includes a number of special keys that you can use during the 
boot process. These keys really come in handy when you need to force your 
operating system to do something that it normally wouldn’t, such as boot 
from a CD instead of the hard drive.
 
✦ To boot from a CD or DVD: Restart your Mac while pressing the C key. 
This is a great way to free your startup volume when you want to test it 
or optimize it using a commercial utility.
 
✦ To eject a recalcitrant disc that doesn’t show up on the Desktop: 
Restart Mac OS X and hold down the mouse button — or if you have a 
late-model Mac, press the Media Eject key as soon as you hear that mag-
nificent startup chord.
 
✦ To force your Mac to boot in Mac OS X: Hold down the X key while 
restarting or booting the Mac.
 
✦ To display a system boot menu: Hold down the Option key while 
restarting or booting the Mac, and you can choose which operating 
system you want to use.
 
✦ To prevent start-up applications from running during login: Hold down 
the Shift key while you click the Login button on the Login screen. If you 
don’t see the Login screen during startup, just hold down Shift while 
Mac OS X boots until the Finder menu appears.

Crave the Newest Drivers
No chapter on maintenance would be complete without a reminder to keep 
your hardware drivers current. Drivers are simply programs that allow your 
Mac to control hardware devices, such as a video card or an external SATA 
(eSATA) card that you’ve added to your Mac. The Mac OS X Software Update 
feature that I discuss earlier, in the section “Updating Mac OS X,” provides 
most of the drivers that you need for things like printers, USB and FireWire 
peripherals, and digital cameras, but it’s still very important to check those 
manufacturer Web sites.
As can the software updates from Apple, updated drivers can fix bugs and 
even add new features to your existing hardware, which is my definition of 
getting something for nothing.

for the Big X
In This Chapter
✓ Using the Mac OS X Help Center
✓ Searching for specific help
✓ Getting help in applications
✓ Finding other help resources
W
hether the voice echoes from a living room, home office, or college 
computer lab, it’s all too familiar: a call for help. No matter how well 
written the application or how well designed the operating system, sooner 
or later you’re going to need support. That goes for everyone from the 
novice to the experienced Mac owner to the occasional e-mail user to the 
most talented software developer.
In this short but oh-so-important chapter, I lead you through the various help 
resources available within Mac OS X as well as native Mac OS X applications. 
I show you how to tap additional resources from Apple, and I also point you 
to other suppliers of high-quality (as well as even questionable) assistance 
from sources on the Internet and in your local area.
Displaying the Help Viewer Window
Your first line of defense is the Mac OS X Help Viewer, as shown in Figure 8-1. 
To display the Help Viewer from the Finder menu, click Help and choose 
Mac Help; or you can press the Ô+? keyboard shortcut (or, if you think 
about it, Ô+Shift+/ or the forward slash key keyboard shortcut). This Help 
menu is context sensitive, so it contains different menu items when you’re 
working inside an application.
As shown in Figure 8-1, the Help Viewer is divided into three sets of controls:
 
✦ Toolbar: The toolbar includes navigational controls (Back, Forward, 
and Home buttons), an Action button (where you can print a topic or 
change the text size), and the Ask a Question (or Search) text box. On 
the far right, you see an Index link; click it to display an alphabetical 
index of help topics.

130
Searching for Specific Stuff
 
✦ Quick Clicks: Clicking these links takes you directly to some of the most 
frequently asked Help topics for the Finder (or the application you’re 
using), such as Connecting to the Internet and Switching from Windows. To 
use a Quick Click, just click once on the question that you want to pursue.
 
✦ Apple Web site link: Click this link to display the latest Mac OS X news 
and the latest Help topics from the Apple Web site.

I know that the Help Viewer looks a little sparse at first glance. However, 
when you realize how much information has to be covered to help someone 
with an operating system — check out the size of the book you’re holding, for 
instance — you get an idea of why Mac OS X doesn’t try to cover everything 
on one screen. Instead, you get the one tool that does it all: the Spotlight 
search box.
Searching for Specific Stuff
To search for the Help topic you need, here are two paths to righteousness:
 
✦ From the Finder Help menu: Wowzers! In Snow Leopard, you don’t 
even have to open the Help Viewer to search for assistance on a specific 
topic . . . just choose Help from the Finder menu, click in the Search field 
right there in the menu, and type a keyword or two. (Although you can 
ask a full-sentence question, I find that the shorter and more concise 
your search criteria are, the more relevant your results are.) As with the 
Spotlight search box, you don’t need to press Return; just click the topic 
that sounds the most helpful.

131
Searching for Specific Stuff
 
✦ From the Help Viewer: Click in the Search text box at the right side 
of the toolbar, type one or two words that sum up your question, and 
press Return. Figure 8-2 illustrates a typical set of topics concerning 
DVD movies.
 
Figure 8-2:

No matter which method you use, the topics are sorted by approximate 
relevance first. Within the Help Viewer, articles taken from the AppleCare 
Support section of the Apple Web site appear in the Support Articles portion 
of the window. (Because Web stuff is going on in the background, you don’t 
see these articles unless your Mac has an active Internet connection.)
You can double-click any topic to display the topic text, which looks like the 
text that you see in Figure 8-3.

To move back to the previous topic that you chose, click the Back button on 
the Help Viewer toolbar.
Prodding Apple for the Latest Gossip
As I mention in the earlier section, “Displaying the Help Viewer Window,” 
in this chapter, I heartily recommend that you visit the Apple Web site at 
www.apple.com and surf wildly to and fro. You’ll often pick up on news and 
reviews that you won’t find anywhere else on the Internet.
From the opening Web screen, click the Hot News link on the Apple tab and 
the Support tab during every visit to the Apple site. These pages give you
 
✦ Articles about the latest news from Cupertino
 
✦ Downloads of the latest Mac OS X freeware, shareware, and demoware
 
✦ The Knowledge Base (an online searchable troubleshooting reference)
 
✦ News about upcoming versions of Mac OS X and Apple applications 
galore
You’ll also find Mac OS X product manuals in Adobe Acrobat PDF format and 
online discussion forums that cover Mac OS X.
Calling for Help Deep in the Heart of X
A number of different help avenues are available within Mac OS X applications 
as well. They include
 
✦ The Help button: A number of otherwise upstanding Mac OS X windows, 
dialogs, and System Preference panes include a Help button, as shown 
in the lower right of Figure 8-4. Click the button marked with ? to display 
the text for the settings in that dialog or window.
 
✦ Pop-up help for fields and controls: Most Mac OS X applications display 
a short line of help text when you hover the mouse pointer on top of a 
field or control. Sometimes it’s just the name of the item; sometimes it’s 
a full descriptive line. Them’s the breaks.
 
✦ Application-specific help: Applications typically have their own Help 
system, which can use the Help Viewer, a separate Help display program, 
or a HyperText Markup Language (HTML; read that Web-based) Help 
system.

Other Resources to Chew On
Although the Help Viewer can take care of just about any question that you 
might have about the basic controls and features of Mac OS X, you might 
also want to turn to other forms of help when the going gets a little rougher. 
In this last section, I cover resources that you can call on when the Help 
Viewer just isn’t enough.
Voice support
As of this writing, Apple provides voice technical support for Mac OS X. You 
can find the number to call in your Mac’s printed manuals or online in the 
Support section of the Apple Web site. However, exactly when you qualify 
for voice support and exactly how long it lasts depends on a number of 
different factors, such as whether you received Mac OS X when you bought a 
new machine or whether you purchased a support plan from Apple.
You can also try the general online support site at www.info.apple.com — 
it’s a great starting point for obtaining Mac OS X help.
Mac publications and resource sites
You can refer to a number of great Mac-savvy publications and resources, 
both printed and online, for help. My favorites include
 
✦ Macworld (www.macworld.com) and MacLife (www.macaddict.com) 
magazines, both in archaic hard copy and oh-so-slick online versions
 
✦ MacGamer (www.macgamer.com), the online gaming resource for the 
Macintosh

134
Other Resources to Chew On
 
✦ VersionTracker (www.versiontracker.com), an online resource for 
the latest updates on all sorts of Macintosh third-party applications
 
✦ MacFixIt (www.macfixit.com), a well-respected troubleshooting site 
devoted to the Mac that offers downloads, news, and discussion areas (a 
subscription is required for some of the more useful sections of the site)
 
In most of my books, I mention specific Internet newsgroups that cater to 
the topic I’m discussing; however, virtually all the Mac-specific newsgroups 
are devoted to illegally swapping pirated games and applications, so I don’t 
cover them. Also, the help that you receive from individuals in newsgroups 
is sometimes misguided — and sometimes downright wrong — so take any 
claims with a grain of salt.
 
As a general rule, never identify yourself or provide your snail-mail or e-mail 
addresses in a newsgroup post! These messages are public, and they remain 
hanging around in cyberspace on newsgroup servers for years — you’ll be a 
prime target for spam (or even worse).
Local Mac outlets and user groups
Finally, you can find local resources in any medium-size to large town or 
city: A shop that’s authorized by Apple to sell and repair Macintosh 
computers can usually be counted upon to answer a quick question over the 
phone or provide more substantial support for a fee. (For example, my local 
Mac outlet sponsors inexpensive classes for new Mac owners, and if you can 
reach an Apple Store, the Genius Bar is a great resource.)
You might also be lucky enough to have a local Macintosh user group that 
you can join — members can be counted on for free answers to your support 
questions at meetings and demonstrations. To find a group near you, visit 
the Apple User Group Support site at www.apple.com/usergroups and 
use the locator.

ac OS X Snow Leopard is rugged, stable, and reliable — and as you 
can read in Chapter 7 of this minibook, practicing regular mainte-
nance can help eliminate problems caused by everything from power fail-
ures to faulty software drivers to cats on the keyboard. However, sooner 
or later you will encounter what I like to call The Dark Moments . . . a blank 
screen, a locked Mac, or an external device that sits there uselessly like an 
expensive paperweight.
How you handle The Dark Moments defines you as a true Mac OS X power 
user because most folks seem to fall into one of two categories: Either you 
panic and beat your head against the wall (which really has little effect on 
the computer, when you think about it), or you set your brow in grim deter-
mination and follow the troubleshooting models that I provide in this chap-
ter to locate (and, I hope, fix) the source of the problem.
Don’t Panic!
My friend, this is the first — and most important — rule of troubleshooting, 
and yet another of Mark’s Maxims:
 
Whatever the problem, you can fix it (or get it fixed).
Most computer owners seem to forget the idea that a hardware or software 
error can be fixed because they panic — they simply see The Problem, and 
somehow they feel that they’ll never be able to use their computer again.
Although the situation might look grim, don’t ignore these facts:
 
✦ You don’t need to scrap your Mac. As long as you haven’t taken a 
hammer or a chainsaw to your Mac, the problem is only temporary. 
Sure, individual components do fail over time — heck, so do people — 
but the problem is certainly something that can be tracked down and 
fixed without scrapping your entire computer.

The Troubleshooting Process
136
 
✦ Don’t beat yourself up. As long as you haven’t installed a virus on pur-
pose or deleted half your system files to spite yourself, the problem isn’t 
your fault. Sure, it’s possible that you might have done something by 
accident, but don’t blame yourself — it happens to everybody.
 
✦ Trust your Apple dealer. As long as an Apple dealer is in your area, you 
can always get your computer repaired professionally if a component’s 
gone south. (In some cases, professional help is a necessity: For exam-
ple, I’d be a fool to try to fix a power supply or a monitor on my own 
because both can pack a heavy electrical punch.)
 
✦ Rely on your backup. As long as you’ve made a backup, you won’t lose 
much (if any) work. (You did back up your hard drive, didn’t you? I harp 
about backups further in Chapter 7 of this minibook.) I’m talking about a 
backup to an external hard drive here, using either an application such 
as Disk Utility or Snow Leopard’s Time Machine feature.
Commit these facts to head and heart, and you can rest easy while you track 
down and attack the real enemy — whatever’s causing the problem.
The Troubleshooting Process
When I first conceived this chapter, I had originally decided to divide this 
section into separate hardware and software troubleshooting procedures. 
However, that turned out to be impractical because often you won’t know 
whether a problem is caused by hardware or software until you’re practically 
on top of it.
Therefore, here’s the complete 12-step troubleshooting process that I 
designed while working as a consultant and Macintosh hardware techni-
cian for 15 years. Feel free to add your own embellishments in the margin or 
include reminders with sticky notes.
 
If you’re not sure quite what’s producing the error, this process is designed 
to be linear — meaning that it’s meant to be followed in order — but if you 
already know that you’re having a problem with one specific peripheral or 
one specific application, feel free to jump to the steps that concern only 
hardware or software.
 
It’s always a good idea to create a completely default user account for trouble-
shooting — techs call this a vanilla or clean account. You can use the vanilla 
account to test whether a problem occurs system-wide or is limited to a 
single user account. For example, this is a great way to determine whether 
an application is misbehaving because of a corrupted preference file: If the 
same problem doesn’t appear when you use the application with the vanilla 
account, the culprit is likely the user’s copy of the application’s preference 
file. (Follow the instructions provided by the application for resetting or 
deleting the preference file it creates.)

The Troubleshooting Process
137
137
Step 1: Always try a simple shutdown
You’d be amazed at how often a reboot (the process of shutting down and 
restarting) can cure a temporary problem. For example, this can fix the occa-
sional lockup in Mac OS X or a keyboard that’s not responding because of a 
power failure. If possible, make sure that you first close any open documents; 
otherwise, you might lose unsaved work. When troubleshooting, always do a 
shutdown instead of simply restarting the computer because when Mac OS X 
shuts down, all the hardware components that make up your system are reset.
 
If your Mac is locked tight and you can’t use the Shut Down command from 
the Apple menu (Ú), you have two choices. First, press and hold the Power 
button on your Mac for a few seconds (which turns your computer off). If 
this doesn’t work — and, from time to time, it actually doesn’t — you have 
to physically pull the power cord from the wall (or turn off the surge protec-
tor, if you’re using one).
Step 2: Check all cable connections
Check all connections: the AC power cord and the keyboard cord, as well as 
any modem or network connections and all cable connections to external 
peripherals. Look for loose connectors — and if you have a cat or dog, don’t 
forget to check for chew marks. (Yep, that’s the voice of experience talking 
there.) If you’ve recently replaced a cable — especially a network, Universal 
Serial Bus (USB), or FireWire cable — replace it with a spare to see whether 
the problem still occurs.
Step 3: Retrace your steps
If the problem continues to occur, the next step is to consider what you’ve 
done in the immediate past that could have affected your Mac. Did you 
install any new software, or have you connected a new peripheral? If your 
Mac was working fine until you made the change to your system, the prob-
lem likely lies in the new hardware or software.
 
✦ If you added an external device: Turn off your Mac and disconnect the 
peripheral. Then turn on the computer to see whether all proceeds nor-
mally. If so, check the peripheral’s documentation and make sure that 
you correctly installed the driver — the software provided by the device 
manufacturer — and that you connected it properly to the right port. 
(You can also use System Profiler, which I discuss later in this chapter, 
to check to see whether your Mac recognizes the external device.) To 
verify that the cable works, substitute another cable of the same type or 
try the peripheral on another Mac.

The Troubleshooting Process
138
 
 Make it a practice to check the manufacturer’s Web site for the latest 
driver when you get new hardware. The software that ships in the box 
with your new toy could have been on the shelf for months before being 
sold, and the manufacturer has probably fine-tuned the driver in the 
interim. You should also run Software Update to verify that the drivers 
that Apple supplies are up-to-date.
 
✦ If you installed new software or applied an update/patch: Follow the 
guidelines in Chapter 7 of this minibook to uninstall the application and 
search for any files that it might have created elsewhere. (Searching 
by date created and date modified can help you locate files that were 
recently created.) If this fixes the problem, it’s time to contact the devel-
oper and request technical support for the recalcitrant program; you 
can always re-install the program after the problem has been solved by 
the developer.
 
 Not all versions of Mac OS X are created equal. If you’ve recently upgraded 
to a major or minor new release of Mac OS X, some of the applications 
that you’ve been using without trouble for months can suddenly go on 
the warpath and refuse to work (or exhibit quirky behavior). If this hap-
pens, visit the developer’s Web site often to look for a patch file that will 
update the application to work with the new version of Mac OS X.
 
✦ If you recently made a change within System Preferences: It’s possible 
that you’ve inadvertently “bumped” something. For instance, you might 
have accidentally changed your modem or network settings or perhaps 
made a change to your login options. Verify the settings screens that 
you visited to make sure that everything looks okay.
Step 4: Run Disk Utility
Next, run Disk Utility (as shown in Figure 9-1) to check for disk errors and 
permissions errors — especially permissions errors, which can wreak abso-
lute havoc on just about any application on your hard drive. (Click the Disk 
Utility icon in the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder. Chapter 7 of 
this minibook provides all the details.)
Step 5: Run antivirus software
Run your antivirus software and scan your entire system for viruses, includ-
ing all system disks and removable disks. Although Mac OS X doesn’t come 
with antivirus protection built in, the world-class programs Norton AntiVirus 
(www.symantec.com) and Intego VirusBarrier X5 (www.intego.com) con-
stantly scan each file that you open or download for infections.
 
If you haven’t already set your antivirus application to automatically update 
itself, download the latest virus update — usually called a signature file or 
data file — to keep your virus protection current.

Figure 9-1:

Utility to

integrity of 
your drive 
and files.
 
Step 6: Check the Trash
Check the contents of your Trash to make sure that you haven’t inadver-
tently tossed something important that could be causing trouble for an 
application. Click the Trash icon in the Dock to open the Trash window and 
peruse its contents. (To see the file types easier, switch to List mode.) To 
restore items to their rightful place, drag them from the Trash back to the 
correct folder on your hard drive.
Step 7: Check online connections
If you’re connected to an Ethernet network, a cable modem, or a digital sub-
scriber line (DSL), check your equipment to make sure that you’re currently 
online and receiving packets normally. Your network system administrator 
will be happy to help you with this, especially if you’re blood relatives.
Step 8: Disable troublesome Login Items
Disable any Login Items that might be causing trouble. As you can read in 
Book II, Chapter 3, Login Items are launched automatically as soon as you log 
in. For example, an older application that doesn’t fully support Mac OS X can 
cause problems if used as a Login Item. You can do this from the Login Items 
settings in the System Preferences Accounts pane (as shown in Figure 9-2); 
click the Apple menu, choose System Preferences, click Accounts, and 
then click the Login Items tab.

The Troubleshooting Process
140
 
Figure 9-2:
A 
misbehaving 
Login Item 
can cause 
you a world 
of grief.
 
Unfortunately, if a Login Item doesn’t display an error message, your old 
friend Trial-and-Error is just about the only sure-fire way to detect which 
item (if any) is causing the problem. Click an item to select it, click the 
Remove button (marked with a minus sign), and then press Ô+Q to quit 
System Preferences. Log out to see whether the problem’s solved. (If not, 
don’t forget to add the item again to the Login Items list.)
 
You can also disable Login Items entirely when you reboot. If the login 
window appears when you reboot your computer, hold down the Shift key 
and then click the Login button. If you don’t see the login window when you 
reboot, hold down the Shift key when you see the James Bond–style twirling 
progress indicator in the startup window and continue to hold down the key 
until the Finder appears.
Step 9: Turn off your screen saver
Another candidate for intermittent lockups is your screen saver, especially 
if you’re running a shareware effort written by a 12-year-old with a limited 
attention span. Display your System Preferences, choose Desktop & Screen 
Saver, and click the Screen Saver tab. You can deactivate the saver entirely 
(by moving the Start Screen Saver slider to Never) or choose the Computer 
Name saver (which is provided by Apple) from the Screen Savers list.
Step 10: Check for write protection
If you’re running a multiuser ship, check to make sure that another user with 
administrator access hasn’t accidentally write-protected your documents, 
your application, or its support files. If possible, log in with an administrator

141
account yourself (as I describe in Book II, Chapter 5) and then try running 
the application or opening the document that you were unable to access 
under your own ID.
 
Trying an application under the aforementioned “clean” account is also a 
great way to determine whether your user-specific preference file for that 
application has been corrupted. If you can run the application using your 
“clean” account, contact the software developer to see how you can repair 
or delete a preference file that’s causing problems.
Step 11: Check your System Profiler
If you’ve reached this point in the troubleshooting process and haven’t 
found the culprit, you’ve probably experienced a hardware failure in your 
Macintosh. If possible, display the Hardware category within the Apple 
System Profiler (see Figure 9-3) and make sure that it can recognize and use 
all the internal drives, ports, and external devices on your Mac. To start the 
System Profiler, click the Apple menu, choose About This Mac, and then 
click the More Info button.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Use System 
Profiler to 
check the 
devices and 
ports on 
your system.
 
Step 12: Reboot with the Mac OS X Installation disc
In case your Mac is in sad shape and won’t even boot from its hard drive, 
here’s a last step that you can take before you seek professional assistance: 
Reboot your Mac from the Mac OS X Snow Leopard Installation disc. Hold 
down the C key immediately after you hear the startup chord (which boots 

Do I Need to Reinstall Mac OS X?
142
your system from the DVD-ROM drive) and then run Disk Utility from the 
Installation DVD’s Apple menu that appears. Because you’ve booted the 
system from the installation disc, you can verify and repair problems with 
your startup hard drive. (Some new Mac models also come with a diagnostic 
DVD that can help you pin down hardware problems.) After you’re done, 
restart your system.
Do I Need to Reinstall Mac OS X?
To be honest, this is a difficult question to answer. Technically, you should 
never need to reinstall the Big X, but there’s also no reason why you can’t.
I can think of only two scenarios where reinstalling the operating system 
will likely solve a problem. One, if your system files have been so heavily 
corrupted — by a faulty hard drive or a rampaging virus, for example — that 
you can’t boot Mac OS X at all. Two, if the operating system encounters 
the death-dealing kernel panic on a regular basis. A kernel panic displays a 
dialog that instructs you to restart your Mac (in multiple languages, no less), 
usually overwriting whatever’s on the monitor at the time. (This is analo-
gous to the infamous Windows Blue Screen of Death — I’ve grown to hate 
that shade of blue with a passion.)
 
If you receive kernel panics on an ongoing basis, something is really, really 
wrong. Make sure that your documents are copied to a rewriteable DVD or 
network drive, and don’t overwrite any existing backup that you have with a 
new backup because the backup application is likely to lock up as well.
To reinstall, you must reboot from your Mac OS X Snow Leopard Installation 
disc. Hold down the C key immediately after you hear your Mac’s startup 
chord. (Read the earlier section, “Step 12: Reboot with the Mac OS X 
Installation disc.”)
It’s Still Not Moving: Troubleshooting Resources
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you can pursue other avenues to get 
help when you can’t solve a troubleshooting problem on your own. Mind 
you, I’m talking about professional help from sources that you can trust. 
Although you can find quite a bit of free advice on the Internet (usually on 
privately run Web sites and in the Internet newsgroups), most of it isn’t 
worth your effort. In fact, some of it’s downright wrong. That said, here are 
some sources that I do recommend.

The Mac OS X Help Viewer
Although most Mac OS X owners tend to blow off the Help Viewer when the 
troubleshooting gets tough, that’s never the best course of action. Always 
take a few moments to search the contents of the Help Viewer — click Help 
on the Finder menu — to see whether any mention is made of the problem 
that you’ve encountered.
The Apple Mac OS X Support site
Home to all manner of support questions and answers, the Mac OS X Support 
section of the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/support) should be your 
next stop in case of trouble that you can’t fix yourself. Topics include
 
✦ Startup issues
 
✦ Internet and networking problems
 
✦ Printing problems
You can search the Apple Knowledge Base, download the latest updates and 
electronic manuals, and participate in Apple-moderated discussion boards 
from this one central location.
Your local Apple dealer
Naturally, an Apple dealer can provide just about any support that you’re 
likely to need — for a price — but you can usually get the answers to impor-
tant questions without any coinage changing hands. Your dealer is also well 
versed in the latest updates and patches that can fix those software incom-
patibility problems. Check your telephone book for your local dealer.

T
he Finder is the heart of Mac OS X — and we all know how heart sur-
geons like to tinker, don’t we? (Ouch. Start again.)
The Finder is the heart of Mac OS X, and as you might expect, it’s highly con-
figurable. You can customize the Finder to present icons, or you can peruse 
folders with a column view that can pack much more information on-screen at 
one time. Some folks prefer the default Finder toolbar, and others like to cus-
tomize it with the applications and features that they use most often.
Decisions like these can help you transform Snow Leopard into Your 
Personal Operating System — and every Mac OS X power user worth the title 
will take the time to apply these changes because an operating system that 
presents visual information the way that you want to see it is easier and 
more efficient to use.
No need for a hammer or saw — when you’re building the Finder of your 
dreams, the only tool that you need is your mouse!
Will That Be Icons or Lists or 
Columns . . . or Even a Flow?
The default appearance of a window in Mac OS X uses the familiar large-format 
icons that have been a hallmark of the Macintosh operating system since Day 
One — but there’s no reason you have to use them. (In fact, most Mac OS X 
power users I know consider the icon view mode rather inefficient and slow.) 

Will That Be Icons or Lists or Columns . . . or Even a Flow?
148
Besides the icon view, as shown in Figure 1-1, Mac OS X offers three other 
window view modes: list, column, and flow.
 
Figure 1-1: 
A Finder 
window in 
icon view 
mode.
 
 
 Mac OS X old-timers will thrill to the slider control at the bottom-right 
corner of Finder windows in icon view mode. Why? Drag this control to 
the right to expand the size of the icons within the window, and drag the 
control to the left to reduce the icon size! (This is A Big Thing for those 
who prefer icon view — and it makes quite a difference for those with 
less-than-perfect eyesight.)
 
✦ List view: List view displays the folders on the volume in a hierarchical 
fashion. To display the contents of a folder, you can either click the right-
facing small triangle next to the folder name — it rotates downward to 
indicate that you’ve expanded the folder — or you can double-click the 
folder icon to display the contents in a Finder window. To collapse the 
contents of the folder, click the small triangle again; it rotates back to face 
the right. Figure 1-2 illustrates the same Finder window in list view.
 
 You can resize a column by dragging the right edge of the column 
heading.
 
✦ Column view: Figure 1-3 shows the same window in column view, in 
which the volumes on your Mac OS X system are displayed on the 
left. Each column on the right represents a lower level of subfolders. 
Click the volume in the Devices list and then click the desired folder 
in the first column on the right to display its contents, and so forth. 
(Personally, this is my favorite view — thanks, Apple! It’s efficient and 
fast as all get-out.) When you drill deeper, the columns shift automati-
cally to the left. When you click an item (instead of a folder), the Finder 
displays a preview and a quick summary of the selected item in the 
rightmost column.

Figure 1-3:

 Each column has its own scroll bar (for those really, really big folders), 
and you can drag the column handle at the bottom of the separators to 
resize the column width to the left. When you hold down Option and 
drag a column handle, all the columns are adjusted at once.
 
✦ Flow view: When a new software feature or function turns out to be 
incredibly popular, a developer tries to use it wherever possible — 
hence the Flow view shown in Figure 1-4, which Apple took directly 
from the Cover Flow view that proved so successful in iTunes (as well 
as on the iPhone and iPod touch). Flow view still displays the sidebar, 
but each document or item is showcased in a preview pane (and with 
an accurate thumbnail, if possible). You can resize the preview pane 

Will That Be Icons or Lists or Columns . . . or Even a Flow?
150
by dragging the three-line handle on the bottom edge of the pane. The 
remainder of the Finder window in Flow view works very similarly to list 
view, complete with the rotating triangles. However, if you like, you can 
click the scroll buttons or drag the scroll bar under the preview pane to 
move through the contents of your drive in a very classy visual display!

Another of my pet peeves is cluttered disks. If you’re continually having 
problems locating files and folders, ask yourself, “Self, do I need to organize? 
Am I — gasp — cluttered?” If your answer is yes, take an hour and organize 
your files logically into new folders. (Remember, I’m talking your documents 
and such — not your applications, which are usually where they need to be — 
in your Applications folder.) Often, documents that you create end up as 
stragglers, usually located in the root folder of your hard drive, which 
sooner or later ends up looking like a biker bar after Ladies’ Night. (The 
same can be said of many Mac OS X Desktops, too.) By keeping your root 
folder and Desktop clean and saving your files in organized folders, you 
waste less time searching for files and more time actually using them.
To switch between the four modes, click one of the four view mode buttons 
on the Finder window toolbar (the current view is highlighted) or click the 
View menu and choose As Icons, As List, As Columns, or As Cover Flow. Mac 
OS X places a helpful check mark next to the current view mode. (Keyboard 
lovers can hold down Ô and press the 1, 2, 3, or 4 keys to switch views.)

Doing the Toolbar Dance
You can work your customization magic on the Finder toolbar as well! In 
this section, I show you how to customize that strip of icons across the top 
of the Finder window that’s affectionately called the toolbar. Or, if you like, 
you’ll discover how to dismiss it entirely to gain additional real estate for the 
contents of your Finder window. 
Hiding and showing the toolbar
You can toggle the display of the toolbar in an active Finder window in one 
of three ways:
 
✦ By clicking the toolbar button located at the upper-right corner of the 
Finder window
 
✦ By pressing Ô+Option+T
 
✦ By choosing View from the Finder menu and then choosing Hide (or 
Show) Toolbar
Hiding the toolbar also hides the Sidebar, which many Mac owners dislike — 
me included.
Hiding and showing the status bar
The status bar at the bottom of the Finder window displays a number of 
helpful informational-type tidbits about the window’s contents. Depending 
on what you’ve opened, the status bar can include
 
✦ Statistics: See the number of items in the window and the amount of free 
space remaining on the volume.
 
✦ A write-protect icon: This icon looks like a pencil with a line running 
through it, as shown in Figure 1-5. This indicates that you don’t have 
write permissions for the contents of the window — or the volume 
where the contents reside. (Note that this doesn’t necessarily mean that 
folders at a lower level are write-protected as well.) You’ll typically see 
this icon when you’re viewing the contents of a CD or DVD, where every-
thing is write-protected.
 
✦ The current automatic icon view setting: For windows in icon view, the 
status bar can display either a grid icon (indicating that the icons are 
set to snap-to-grid) or four tiny icons (indicating that the icons are dis-
played in a sorted order). You’ll discover more about these settings in 
the section “Configuring the View Options,” later in this chapter.

button, the Forward button appears. Click this to return to the contents 
that you had before clicking the Back button.
 
✦ View: Click this control to toggle between the four view modes (icon, 
list, column, or flow).
 
✦ Quick Look: Click this control to display a window with the contents 
of the selected file or document without launching the corresponding 
application. Quick Look works with all sorts of images, video, and docu-
ments, allowing you to efficiently peruse files on your system without 
the hassle of constantly launching and quitting applications. Quick Look 
works in any Finder window view mode, too. To activate Quick Look for 
a selected file from the keyboard, press the spacebar.

 While Quick Look is active, a number of format-specific buttons appear 
at the bottom of the Quick Look window. For example, displaying an 
image file in Quick Look adds a button that can automatically import 
the image into iPhoto. These buttons vary with the format or type of 
document, but you’ll always see a full-screen/exit full-screen button that 
toggles the Quick Look window between full-screen and regular size.
 
Pssst. Selecting a folder and pressing the spacebar displays a summary of its 
size and last modification date. Pass it on.
 
✦ Action: Click this pop-up menu to display context-sensitive commands 
for the selected items. In plain English, you’ll see the commands that 
you’d see if you held down Control and clicked the selection.
 
✦ Search: Okay, I know it’s not technically an icon, but the Search box is 
a member of the default toolbar family nonetheless. You can search for 
a file or folder using this box. More on this in the section “Searching for 
Files from the Toolbar,” later in this chapter.
But, as one of my favorite bumper stickers so invitingly asks, “Why be 
normal?” Adding or deleting items from the toolbar is a great way to custom-
ize Mac OS X. Follow these steps:
 
1. From the active Finder window menu, choose View➪Customize 
Toolbar to display the sheet that you see in Figure 1-6.
 
 Along with controls such as Back, Forward, and View, you find a number 
of system functions, such as Eject and Burn.
 
Figure 1-6:

the toolbar 
status quo in 
Mac OS X.

2. To add items to the toolbar, drag them from the Customize Toolbar 
dialog up to the toolbar at the top of the window.
 
 To add an item between existing buttons, drop it between the buttons, 
and they obligingly move aside. If you get exuberant about your toolbar 
and you add more icons than it can hold, a double-right arrow appears 
at the right side of the toolbar. A click of the arrow displays a pop-up 
menu with the icons that won’t fit.
 
 In fact, the Customize Toolbar dialog isn’t necessary for some toolbar 
modifications: You can also drag files, folders, and disk volumes directly 
from the Desktop or other Finder windows and add them to your toolbar 
at any time. To remove a file, folder, or disk volume from the toolbar, hold 
down Control and click (or right-click) the icon on the toolbar; then click 
Remove Item from the pop-up menu — it vanishes like a CEO’s ethics.
 
 You can also hold down Ô and drag any item off the toolbar, or hold 
down Ô and drag toolbar items to reorder them.
 
 You can always drag a file or folder into the Sidebar column at the left of 
the Finder window. (The Sidebar column is a separate entity entirely 
from the toolbar.)
 
3. To remove an item from the toolbar, drag it off to the center of the 
window, amongst the other icons.
 
4. Naturally, you can swap item positions. Just click an item, drag it to its 
new spot, and then release the mouse button.
 
5. To choose the default toolbar configuration or to start over, drag the 
default bar at the bottom of the window to the toolbar at the top.
 
 This is the toolbar equivalent of tapping your ruby slippers together 
three times and repeating, “There’s no place like home.”
 
6. To toggle between displaying the icons with accompanying text (the 
default), the icon only, or a text button only, click the Show pop-up 
menu at the bottom of the Customize Toolbar dialog.
 
7. After you arrange your toolbar as you like, click the Done button.
Searching for Files from the Toolbar
Need to find a file fast? The default toolbar has just what you need: the 
Search field, which offers the ability to perform a Spotlight search for a string 
of text within your files (including both filenames and contents). To locate a 
file with the Search field, follow these steps:
 
1. Click in the Search box on the toolbar and type the text that you want 
to find.

 It’s the text box on the right with the magnifying glass. (The folks at 
Apple are really, really into Sherlock Holmes . . . so am I!) If you need to 
clear the field and start over again, click the circular X button, which 
appears only when text is in the Search field.
 
 Hey, who needs to press Return? The Finder immediately displays the files 
with names (or contents) that include the text, as shown in Figure 1-7.

2. To display the location of a file, click it once. To launch it, double-
click the entry.
 
 Files can also be moved or copied from the Search results list with the 
standard drag and Option+drag methods.
 
3. To perform a new search, click the circular X button and type new 
text in the Search field.
 
 To return to your original location in the Finder window, click the Back 
button on the toolbar.
Searching for Files from the Find Dialog
Although the Search box on the toolbar is all you usually need to find most 
files and folders, sometimes you need a little more flexibility and power

to locate what you need on your system. To do so, add the Find controls, 
which you can use to create custom searches with more complex criteria. 
To locate a file by using the Find controls, follow these steps:
 
1. With the Finder active, display the Find controls by pressing Ô+F 
(or choose File from the Finder menu and then choose Find).
 
 Mac OS X displays the controls that you see in Figure 1-8.
 
Figure 1-8: 
The Find 
controls add 
a bit of extra 
power to a 
search.
 
 
2. Click the buttons at the top of the list to specify where you want to 
search.
 
 You can choose Computer (your entire system, including network 
volumes), a local volume, or your Home folder.
 
3. To search for a specific filename, click the first pop-up menu in a row and 
choose Name; then type all or part of the filename in the Contains box.
 
 Snow Leopard automatically begins searching as soon as you type at 
least one character.
 
 After you locate the file or folder that you need, click the entry name to 
reveal the location of the matching file or folder. You can also double-
click it to launch (or display) it.
 
4. If you want to search for a text string within the document itself, click 
the first pop-up menu in a row, choose Contents, and then type the 
string to match in the box.

 The text must appear just as you’ve typed it, so it’s always a good idea 
to restrict what you’re searching for to a minimum of words that you’re 
fairly sure will cause a match. (Content searching is not case sensitive, 
though.) Content searching works only when you’ve generated an index, 
which I explain later in this section.
 
5. To include additional search criteria lines, click the button with the 
plus sign next to the last criterion line.
 
 You can limit your results based on all sorts of rules, including the date 
that the file or folder was last modified, when it was created, the file 
type, the size, the extension, or whether the file or folder is marked vis-
ible or hidden (such as a system file).
 
 You can also remove a search criterion line by clicking the button with 
the minus sign.
 
6. To save the search criteria that you selected, click Save.
 
 This creates a Smart Folder, which (you’re gonna love this) Snow 
Leopard automatically updates (in real time) to contain whatever items 
match the criteria you’ve saved! You can specify the location for your 
Smart Folder, and you can choose to add it to your Finder sidebar for 
the ultimate convenience. Sweet.
 
7. When you’re done canvassing your computer, click the Back button in 
the Find dialog to return to the Finder.
Configuring the View Options
As I discuss at the beginning of the chapter, you have a lot of control over 
how Mac OS X presents files and folders in the Finder. In this section, I cover 
how you can make further adjustments to the view from your windows. 
(Pardon me for the ghastly cliché posing as a pun.)
Setting icon view options
First, allow me to provide a little detail on housekeeping in the Big X. After 
a few hours of work, a Finder window in icon mode can look something like 
a teenager’s room: stuff strewn all over the place, as I demonstrate with my 
Applications folder in Figure 1-9. To restore order to your Desktop, right-
click (or Control-click) in any open area of the active window and then 
choose Clean Up. This command leaves the icons in approximately the same 
position but snaps them to an invisible grid so that they’re aligned, as shown 
in Figure 1-10.

this mess?
 
 
Figure 1-10:

After things are in alignment, work with the icon view options. (Naturally, 
you’ll want the active Finder window in icon view first, so choose View➪As 
Icons or press Ô+1.) From the Finder menu, choose View➪Show View 
Options — or press that swingin’ Ô+J shortcut — to display the View 
Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-11. (Remember that these are the 
options available for icon view; I discuss the options for list, column, and 
Cover Flow view later in this chapter.)

159
 
Figure 1-11: 
The settings 
available for 
icon view.
 
Of course, Mac OS X remembers the changes that you make within the View 
Options dialog, no matter which view mode you’re configuring. Now, the 
changes that you can make from this dialog include
 
✦ Always Open in Icon View: When you select this check box, each Finder 
window that you open automatically uses icon view. (If deselected, the 
new window uses the last view mode you used.)
 
✦ Resizing your icons: Click and drag the Icon Size slider to shrink or 
expand the icons within the window. The icon size is displayed in 
pixels above the slider. (Remember, however, that Snow Leopard offers 
an icon resizing slider at the lower-right corner of any Finder window 
that’s currently using icon view mode; it’s much easier and more 
convenient just to drag the slider to expand or reduce the size of 
icons in a window.)
 
✦ Specifying grid spacing: Click and drag the Grid Spacing slider to shrink 
or expand the size of the grid used to align icons within the window. The 
larger the grid, the more white space between icons.
 
✦ Resizing icon label text: Click the up and down arrows to the right of 
the Text Size pop-up menu to choose the font size (in points) for icon 
labels.
 
✦ Moving icon label text: Select either the Bottom (default) or the Right 
radio button to choose between displaying the text under your Desktop 
icons or to the right of the icons.
 
✦ Show Item Info: With this check box selected, Mac OS X displays the 
number of items within each folder in the window.

Configuring the View Options
160
 
✦ Show Icon Preview: If you select this check box, the Finder displays icons 
for image files using a miniature of the actual picture. (A cool feature for 
those with digital cameras; however, this does take extra processing time 
because Mac OS X has to load each image file and shrink it down to create 
the icon.)
 
✦ Arranging icons: From this pop-up menu, you can automatically align 
icons to a grid within the window, just as if you had used the Clean Up 
menu command. You can also sort the display of icons in a window by 
choosing one of the following criteria from its pop-up menu: by name, 
date modified, date created, size, item type, or the icon label you’ve 
assigned.
 
✦ Choosing a background: To select a background for the window, select 
one of three radio buttons here:
 
• White: This is the default.
 
• Color: Click a color choice from the color block that appears if you 
make this selection.
 
• Picture: Select this radio button and then click the Select button to 
display a standard Open dialog. Navigate to the location where the 
desired image is stored, click it once to select it, and then click Open.
 
✦ Use as Defaults: When you first open the View Options dialog, the 
changes you’re making apply only to the Finder window that opens 
when you open the selected item — in other words, the item that 
appears in the window’s title bar, such as a folder or drive.
 
 For example, any changes made to the settings in Figure 1-11 will affect 
only my Applications folder because it was the active Finder window 
when I pressed Ô+J. (You might have noticed that the window name 
also appears as the title of the View Options dialog.)
 
 However, you can decide to apply the changes that you make to all 
Finder windows that you view in your current mode . Simply click the 
Use as Defaults button.
After all your changes are made and you’re ready to return to work, click the 
dialog’s Close button to save your settings.
Setting list view options
If you’re viewing the active window in list view, choose View➪Show View 
Options to display the View Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-12.

Figure 1-12: 
Here 
are your 
list view 
settings.
 
As in icon view, changes you make in this dialog normally apply only to this 
window, but you can click Use as Defaults to assign these settings to all win-
dows that you view in list mode. The other list view settings include
 
✦ Always Open in List View: Select this check box and Snow Leopard will 
open all Finder windows in list view. (If deselected, new windows use 
the last view mode you used.)
 
✦ Resizing your icons: You can choose between two sizes of icons.
 
✦ Resizing icon label text: Click the up and down arrows to the right of 
the Text Size pop-up menu to choose the font size (in points) for icon 
labels.
 
✦ Show Columns: Select the check boxes under this heading to display 
additional columns in list view, including the date that the item was 
modified, the creation date, the size, the item type, the version (supplied 
by most applications), the label color, and any comments you’ve added 
in the Info dialog for that item. (In my personal opinion, the more col-
umns you add, the more unwieldy the Finder gets, so I advise disabling 
the display of columns that you won’t use.)
 
✦ Use Relative Dates: Select this check box to display modification dates 
and creation dates with relative terms, such as Today or Yesterday. If 
this freaks you out, deselect this check box to force all dates to act like 
adults.

Configuring the View Options
162
 
✦ Calculate All Sizes: Select this check box to have Mac OS X display the 
actual sizes of folders, including all the files and subfolders they contain. 
(Handy for figuring out where all your disk space went, no?) Note: Using 
this option takes processing time, so I recommend that you avoid using 
it unless you really need to see the size.
 
✦ Show Icon Preview: Select this check box to display preview icons for 
image files. (Again, this takes extra processing time, and the image pre-
view icons are pretty doggone small in list view, so this feature may be 
of limited value to you.)
To save your settings, click the dialog’s Close button.
Setting column view options
To make changes to view options in column view mode, choose View➪Show 
View Options to display the View Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-13.
 
You have only five column view options, and any changes that you make to 
this dialog are always reflected in every column view:
 
✦ Always Open in Column View: If this check box is selected, all Finder 
windows open in column view. (If deselected, new windows use the last 
view mode you used.)

✦ Resizing icon label text: Click the Text Size pop-up menu to choose the 
font size (in points) for icon labels.
 
✦ Show Icons: Select this check box to display icons in the columns. If this 
option is deselected, the icons don’t appear and you’ll gain a little space.
 
✦ Show icon preview: Click this check box to select it, and Snow Leopard 
displays preview icons for image files — taking a little extra time to per-
form this service, naturally. (As you find out in the next bullet, column 
mode can be set to automatically display a preview thumbnail in the last 
column when you click an image or video file, and even some documents 
to boot. . . . Therefore, the usefulness of tiny icon previews in column 
mode may be limited for you.)
 
✦ Show Preview Column: If this check box is selected, clicking a file in 
column mode displays a thumbnail (reduced image) and preview infor-
mation in the right-most column, as shown in Figure 1-14.
 
 If you store a slew of smaller QuickTime movies and digital images on 
your drive, the Preview column is great. (You can even play a QuickTime 
movie from the Preview column.) Of course, longer movies and larger 
photos take more time to load!
 
✦ Arranging icons: Click this pop-up menu to specify the sort criteria for 
the item names displayed in each column, using name, date modified, 
date created, size, item type, or the icon label.
Click the dialog’s Close button to save your settings and return to the Finder.

Setting Cover Flow view options
The View options for Cover Flow view are the same as those for list view 
that I covered earlier in this section, except for Always Open in Cover Flow. 
Select this check box to open all new Finder windows in Cover Flow view. (If 
deselected, new windows use the last view mode you used.)
Setting Finder Preferences
Finally, you can change a number of settings to customize the Finder itself. 
From the Finder menu, click Finder and choose the Preferences menu item 
to display the Finder Preferences dialog that you see in Figure 1-15.
 
Figure 1-15: 
You can 
configure 
your Finder 
preferences 
here.
 
In the General section, the preference settings include
 
✦ Displaying Icons on the Desktop: Select these check boxes to display 
your hard disks, removable volumes (including CDs, DVDs, and iPods), 
and connected network servers.
 
✦ New Finder Windows Open: Click the pop-up menu to specify the spot 
where a new Finder window should open. By default, a new window dis-
plays the contents of your Home folder.
 
✦ Always Open Folders in a New Window: When this check box is 
selected, double-clicking a folder will open it in a new Finder window, as 
did earlier versions of Mac OS. (If deselected, the contents of the folder 
appear in the same Finder window, which makes it easier to focus on 
just the folder you need at the moment.)

Setting Finder Preferences
165
 
✦ Spring-Loaded Folders and Windows: It sounds a little wacky, but using 
this feature can definitely speed up file copying! If this check box is 
selected, you can drag an item on top of a folder — without releasing the 
mouse button — and after a preset time (controlled by the Delay slider), a 
spring-loaded window appears to show you the folder’s contents. At that 
point, you can either release the mouse button to drop the file inside the 
folder (upon which the window disappears), or you can drag the icon on 
top of another subfolder to spring it forth and drill even deeper.
The Labels preference pane is a simple one — just click next to each label 
color to type your own text for that label. (I’ve gotta recommend red for 
deadlines and green for contracts . . . call me sentimental.)
 
From the Sidebar preferences pane, you can choose which default items 
should appear in the Finder window Sidebar column. Your choices include 
locations (such as your Home and Applications folders), network servers, 
removable media, the Desktop itself, and — naturally — your hard drives. To 
add a default item to the Sidebar column, click the corresponding check box 
to select it, or deselect the check box to banish that item forthwith.
The Advanced preference settings include
 
✦ Show All File Extensions: If this check box is selected, the Finder dis-
plays the file extensions at the end of filenames, à la Windows. This 
comes in handy for some applications, where everything from a docu-
ment to a preference file to the application itself all share the same 
icon. However, I find extensions distasteful and leave things set with the 
default of extensions off.
 
✦ Show Warning before Changing an Extension: Also on by default, this 
setting forces Snow Leopard to display a confirmation dialog before 
allowing you to change the extension on a filename. Why? Well, changing 
an extension usually results in a “broken” file association, so the file’s 
corresponding application may not launch automatically any longer 
when you double-click the item. Double-clicking a Word document, for 
example, might not launch Word automatically as it used to do. If you 
show file extensions and you often change them, click this check box to 
disable the warning.
 
✦ Show Warning before Emptying the Trash: By default, this check box 
is selected, and Mac OS X displays a confirmation dialog before allowing 
you to — in the words of Mac OS X patrons around the world — toss the 
Bit Bucket. If you’re interested in speed and trust your judgment (and 
your mouse finger), you can disable this setting.
 
✦ Empty Trash Securely: If you’d prefer to use the more secure method of 
emptying your Trash — where deleted items are far harder for anyone 
to recover — select this check box.

Setting Finder Preferences
166
 
✦ When Performing a Search: Click this pop-up menu to specify whether 
the text you enter in the Finder window Search box should match every-
thing on your Mac or whether the search should be limited to the cur-
rent folder only. Choose Use the Previous Search Scope to use the scope 
setting you used during your last search.
After you make the desired changes to the Finder Preferences, click the 
dialog’s Close button to save your settings and return to the Finder.

✓ Choosing menu colors and highlights
✓ Keeping track of things with Stickies
✓ Customizing the Dock and using Dashboard
✓ Cleaning and sorting the Mac OS X Desktop
“T
weak! Tweak!” It’s not the cry of some exotic bird — that’s the call 
of the wild Mac Power User. Power users like to tweak their Mac OS 
X Desktops just so, with that menu color, this background, and those applica-
tions in the Dock. Noncomputer types just can’t understand the importance 
of the proper arrangement of your virtual workplace: When things are famil-
iar and customized to your needs, you’re more productive, and things get 
done faster. In fact, if you’ve set up multiple users on your computer under 
Mac OS X, the Big X automatically keeps track of each user’s Desktop and 
restores it when that person logs in. (For example, when you use the Mac, 
you get that background photo of Farrah Fawcett from the ’70s whereas 
your daughter gets Avril Lavigne.)
In this chapter, I show you what you can do to produce a Desktop that’s 
uniquely your own, including tweaks that you can make to the background 
and your Desktop icons. I also show you how to use Desktop Stickies 
instead of a forest of paper slips covering your monitor.
With your Mac OS X Desktop clad in the proper harmonious colors — yes, 
that can be your favorite photo of Elvis himself — and your new Dock icons 
ready for action, you’re indeed prepared for whatever lies ahead in your 
computing world!

owner who didn’t change his or her background when presented with the 
opportunity. Favorite backgrounds usually include
 
✦ Humorous cartoons and photos that can bring a smile to your face (even 
during the worst workday)
 
✦ Scenic beauty
 
✦ Photos of family and friends (or the latest Hollywood heartthrob)
 
✦ The company logo (not sure it does much for morale, but it does 
impress the boss)
If you do decide to spruce up your background, you have three choices: You 
can select one of the default Mac OS X background images, choose a solid 
color, or specify your own image. All three backgrounds are chosen from 
the Desktop & Screen Saver pane, located within System Preferences (as 
illustrated in Figure 2-1).

To choose a background from one of the collections provided by Apple, 
click one of these groups from the list at the left:

to somewhat strange and ethereal flux shapes. (You have to see them to 
understand what I mean.)

✦ Nature: These backgrounds feature scenic beauty, such as blades of 
grass, sand dunes, snowy hills . . . that sort of thing.
 
✦ Plants: Close-up backgrounds of plant life — I especially recommend the 
autumn leaves.
 
✦ Black & White: Several truly stunning black-and-white backgrounds that 
look especially good on a widescreen display. These are my favorite 
images provided by Apple.
 
✦ Abstract: These backgrounds have even weirder twisting shapes in flux, 
this time with bright contrasting colors. Good for a psychiatrist’s office.
 
✦ Solid Colors: This is for those who desire a soothing solid shade. More 
on this in the following section.
 
✦ Pictures Folder: This displays the images saved in the active user’s 
Pictures folder.
 
✦ Choose Folder: You can open a folder containing images and display 
them instead. (I discuss this in more detail in a page or two.)
If you see something you like, click the thumbnail, and Mac OS X displays 
it in the well and automatically refreshes your background so that you can 
see what it looks like. (By the way, in the Apple universe, a well is a sunken 
square area that displays an image or color swatch — in this case, the back-
ground image that you select.)
 
Notice your iPhoto albums in the list? That’s no accident — Snow Leopard 
automatically offers your iPhoto Photo Library so that you can choose 
images from your iPhoto collection!
Never let it be said that I can’t dish out revenge 
when necessary. I don’t know whether I should 
call this a Tip or a Devilish Practical Joke That 
Will Drive People Nuts — anyway, it’s fun as 
all get-out. Right before you go to lunch, use 
the Grab utility in your Applications/Utilities 
folder to take a snapshot of your Desktop with 
a number of windows open (or an error dialog 
with an OK or a Close button) and then save 
the image to your Pictures folder. Select the 
image as your Desktop background and then 
watch others go crazy trying to click those faux 
windows, buttons, and icons. For an archen-
emy, try the same trick on his Mac! Arrange a 
slightly embarrassing Desktop on his computer, 
specify it as the background, and sit back while 
the fun begins. (Perhaps a Web browser that’s 
open to a somewhat unusual Web site?)

Mac OS X automatically manipulates how the background appears on your 
Desktop. If an image conforms to your screen resolution, fine — otherwise, 
click the pop-up menu next to the well and you can choose to
 
✦ Tile the background. This repeats the image to cover the Desktop. (This 
is usually done with pattern images to produce a smooth, creamy, 
seamless look.)
 
✦ Fill the screen. This can be used with a solid color to get uniform coverage. 
The original aspect ratio of the image is preserved, so it’s not stretched.
 
✦ Stretch the background to fit the Desktop. If your Desktop image is 
smaller than the Desktop acreage, this works, but be warned — if you 
try to stretch too small of an image over too large a Desktop, the pixi-
lated result can be pretty frightening. (Think of enlarging an old Kodak 
Instamatic negative to a 16 x 20 poster. Dots, dots, dots.) The original 
aspect ratio of the image isn’t preserved, so you might end up with 
results that look like the funhouse mirrors at a carnival.
 
✦ Center the image on the Desktop. This is my favorite solution for 
Desktop images that are smaller than your resolution.
Note that this pop-up menu appears only if the Desktop picture that you 
select isn’t one of the standard Apple images. All the pictures in the Apple 
Desktop Pictures, Nature, Abstract, and Solid Colors categories are scaled 
automatically to the size of your screen.
 
To change your Desktop background automatically on a regular basis, select 
the Change Picture check box and then choose the delay period from the 
corresponding pop-up menu. To display the images in random order, select 
the Random Order check box; otherwise, Mac OS X displays them in the 
order that they appear in the folder. You can also select a translucent Finder 
menu bar, which (almost) blends in with your background. If you prefer a 
solid-color, matter-of-fact workman’s menu bar, click the Translucent Menu 
Bar check box to deselect it.
I just gotta have lavender
As I mention earlier, for those who want their favorite color without the 
distraction of an image, you can choose from a selection of solid colors. You 
can choose from these colors the same way that you’d pick a default Mac OS 
X background image (as I describe in the preceding section).
Selecting your own photo
Finally, you can drag your own image into the well from a Finder window to 
add your own work of art. To view thumbnails of an entire folder, click the 
Pictures Folder (to display the contents of your personal Pictures folder)

or click the Add button (bearing the plus sign) to specify any folder on your 
system. Click the desired thumbnail to embellish your Desktop.
Changing the Screen Saver
Screen savers are another popular item. Because I cover the Screen Saver 
preferences in Chapter 3 of this minibook, I simply illustrate here how to 
choose one. Open System Preferences and click the Desktop & Screen Saver 
icon; then click the Screen Saver tab to display the settings that you see in 
Figure 2-2.

To add a third-party screen saver module so that everyone can use it on a 
multiuser system, copy it into the Screen Savers folder within the top-level 
Library folder. To selfishly keep that saver all to yourself, copy it into your 
user account’s Screen Savers folder (which is located within the Library 
folder in your Home folder).
Click one of the entries in the Screen Savers column to display a thumbnail 
of the effect. Selecting the Use Random Screen Saver check box runs through 
’em all, naturally. You can also test the appearance of the saver module by 
clicking the Test button; the screen saver runs until you move the mouse or 
press a key.
To keep tabs on the current time, click the Show with Clock check box to 
select it. Snow Leopard adds a clock display to any screen saver.

Many screen savers allow you to monkey with their settings. If the Options 
button is enabled (not grayed out), click it to see how you can change the 
effects.

I can’t understand it, but some people just don’t appreciate menus with 
purple highlights! (You can tell a Louisiana State University graduate a mile 
away.) To specify your own colors for buttons, menus, and windows, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open System Preferences and click the Appearance icon to display 
the settings, as shown in Figure 2-3.
 
2. Click the Appearance pop-up menu and choose the main color choice 
for your buttons and menus.
 
3. Click the Highlight Color pop-up menu and pick the highlight color 
that appears when you select text in an application or select an item 
from a list.
 
4. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences and save your changes.

Adding Stickies
Stickies are interesting little beasts — I don’t know their genus or phyla, 
but they’re certainly handy to have around. To be technical for a moment, 
a Sticky is actually nothing more than a special type of application window, 

Book II
Chapter 2
Giving Your Desktop 
the Personal Touch
Changing Colors in Mac OS X
173
but these windows remain on your Desktop as long as the Stickies application 
is running.
I use Stickies for anything that a real-world sticky note can handle, including
 
✦ Reminders that you don’t want to misplace
 
✦ Snippets of text that you want to temporarily store while your Mac 
is turned off (without launching a behemoth like Word or digging for 
TextEdit)
 
✦ Boilerplate (repeated and standard) text that you’re constantly includ-
ing in your documents, such as your address
 
✦ A quick note that includes someone’s e-mail address or phone number
 
✦ Today’s Dilbert cartoon from www.dilbert.com
A Sticky can contain data pasted from the Clipboard, or you can simply type 
directly into the Stickies application window. Sticky windows can include 
graphics and different fonts and colors. You can even locate specific text 
from somewhere in your vast collection of Stickies by using the Find com-
mand within the Stickies application. Just press Ô+F while the Stickies menu 
is active to display the Stickies Find dialog. (And you don’t use up our bark-
covered friends of the forest, either.)
 
In Book I, I discuss the Mac OS X Services menu. You can make a Sticky note 
from the Services menu in many applications as well.
Follow these steps to stick your way to success:
 
1. Open your Applications folder and run the Stickies application to dis-
play the new window that you see in Figure 2-4.
 
 The text cursor is already idling in the new window.
 
2. Type text in the window or press Ô+V to paste the contents of the 
Clipboard into the window.
 
 You can also import the contents of an existing file into a Sticky. Just 
click File and then choose Import Text to display a standard Open dialog.
 
3. (Optional) Add text formatting, change text font, and change font 
color from the Font menu.
 
 From the Note menu, you can also choose to make the Sticky translucent. 
(No pressing reason; they just look cool.)
 
4. To change the Sticky color, click the Color menu and choose the 
appropriate hue.

5. Resize and drag the Sticky window to the desired location.
 
 Press Ô+M to toggle between a miniaturized view (showing only the title 
bar) and the expanded view.
 
To automatically run the Stickies application each time you log on, open the 
Accounts settings in System Preferences and click your account in the list. 
Click the Login Items button and add Stickies to the list by clicking the plus 
button.
To delete a Sticky, simply click the Close button at the upper-left corner of 
the Sticky window. Or click the Sticky to make it the active note and then 
click Close. Stickies display a dialog to confirm that you want to close the 
note; click Save to save the contents in a file or click the Don’t Save button to 
close the note and discard its contents.
To close the Stickies application completely, click any note and press Ô+Q. 
The application remembers the position and contents of each note for when 
you launch it again.

the Personal Touch
Customizing the Dock
175
Customizing the Dock
In terms of importance, the Dock — the launch pad for applications and 
documents that appears on your Desktop — ranks right up there with the 
command center of a modern nuclear submarine. As such, it had better be 
easy to customize, and naturally, Mac OS X doesn’t let you down.
Adding applications and extras to the Dock
Why be satisfied with just the icons that Apple places in the Dock? You can 
add your own applications, files, and folders to the Dock as well.
 
✦ Adding applications: You can add any application to your Dock by 
simply dragging its icon into the area to the left side of the Dock (that’s 
to the left side of the vertical dotted line that’s visible in the Dock). 
You’ll know when you’re in the proper territory because the existing 
Dock icons obligingly move aside to make a space for it.
 
 Attempting to place an application directly on the right side of the Dock 
sends it to the Trash (if the Trash icon is highlighted when you release 
the button), so beware. Note, however, that you can drop an application 
icon inside a Stack or a folder that already exists at the right side of 
the Dock.
 
✦ Adding individual files and volumes: Individual files and volume icons 
can be added to the Dock by dragging the icon into the area to the right 
side of the Dock. (Attempting to place these to the left of the side of 
the Dock opens an application with the contents, which usually doesn’t 
work.) Again, the existing Dock icons will move aside to create a space 
when you’re in the right area.
 
 To open the Dock item you’ve added in a Finder window, press Control 
and click the icon to display a Dock menu, where you can open docu-
ments, run applications, and have other assorted fun, depending on the 
item you choose. (If your mouse has a right button, you can click that 
instead of holding down the Control key.)
 
✦ Adding several files or a folder: Snow Leopard uses a feature called 
Stacks, which I discuss in a few paragraphs, to handle multiple files or 
add an entire folder to the Dock.
 
✦ Adding Web sites: You can drag any URL from Safari directly into the 
area at the right of the Dock. Clicking that icon automatically opens your 
browser and displays that page. (Safari gets the treatment in Book V, 
Chapter 5.) Now that, my friends, is genuine sassy!

Customizing the Dock
176
To remove an icon from the Dock, just click and drag it off the Dock. You get 
a rather silly (but somehow, strangely satisfying) animated cloud of debris, 
and the icon is no more. Note, however, that the original application, folder, 
or volume is not deleted — just the Dock icon itself is permanently excused. If 
you like, you can delete almost any of the default icons that Mac OS X installs 
in the Dock; only the Finder and Trash icons must remain in the Dock.
To set up a Dock icon as a Login Item — without the hassle of opening the 
Accounts pane in System Preferences — just click a Dock icon and hold the 
mouse button down until the pop-up menu appears. Then select the Open at 
Login menu item.
 
If you can’t delete items from the Dock, you’re using a managed account — 
your account is configured with Parental Controls turned on, and your admin-
istrator has deselected the Can Modify the Dock check box in your account. In 
order to delete Dock items, you’ll need an admin-level user to log in; then visit 
the Accounts pane in System Preferences and select the check box again. For 
more information on user accounts, see Chapter 5 of this minibook.
Keeping track(s) with Stacks
I know, it’s a horrible play on words, but my editors are doing me a favor.
Snow Leopard offers Stacks, which are groups of items (documents, applica-
tions, and folders) that you want to place in the Dock for convenience — 
perhaps the files needed for a project you’re working on, or your favorite 
game applications. For example, I have a Stack named Wiley on my Dock 
that holds all the project files I need for the book I’m currently writing.
To create a Stack, just select and drag the items you want to include to the 
right side of the Dock. As always, the Dock opens a spot on the right side of 
the Dock to indicate you’re in the zone.
To display the items in a Stack, just click it:
 
✦ If the Stack holds relatively few items, they’re displayed in a really 
cool-looking arc that Apple calls a fan (as shown in Figure 2-5), and you 
can click the item you want to open or launch.
 
✦ If the Stack is stuffed full of many items, the Stack opens in a grid display, 
allowing you to scroll through the contents to find what you need.
You can remove a Stack from the Dock by Control-clicking or right-clicking 
the Stack icon. To do so, choose Remove from Dock from the menu that 
appears. Alternatively, just drag that sucker right off the Dock.

Figure 2-5: 
Click a 
Stack in 
the Dock 
to view its 
contents.
 
 
If you add a folder full of items, the Stack is named after the folder; otherwise, 
Snow Leopard does the best job it can in figuring out what to name the 
Stack. (Although Apple makes a righteous attempt, I usually end up renam-
ing the Stack. Right-click the Stack icon, or hold down Control while clicking 
the icon, and you’ll see the Rename Stack menu item appear.)
Apple provides two Stacks already set up for you. One, the Download folder, 
situated next to the Trash, is the default location for any new files that you 
download using Safari or receive in your e-mail. Snow Leopard bounces the 
Download Stack icon to indicate that you’ve received a new item. Next to 
the Download Stack is the Documents Stack, which conveniently displays the 
contents of your Documents folder.
Resizing the Dock
You can change the size of the Dock from the Dock settings in System 
Preferences — I explain this in more detail in Book II, Chapter 3 — but 
here’s a simpler way to resize the Dock, right from the Desktop.
Move your mouse cursor over the vertical dotted line that separates the 
left side of the Dock from the right side; the cursor turns into a funky line 
with arrows pointing up and down. This is your cue to click and drag while 
moving the mouse up and down, which expands and shrinks the Dock, 
respectively.
You can also right-click (or hold down the Control key and click) when the 
funky line cursor is visible to display a menu of Dock preferences. This 
allows you to change your Dock preferences without the hassle of opening 
System Preferences and displaying the Dock settings.

Stick It on the Dashboard
178
Stick It on the Dashboard
One of Snow Leopard’s most popular features is Dashboard, which you can 
use to hold widgets and display them with the press of a button. (Okay, I know
that sounds a little wacky, but bear with me.) Widgets are small applications —
dubbed applets — that typically provide only one function. For example, 
Dashboard comes complete with a calculator, a clock, a weather display, and a 
quick-and-simple calendar. You can display and use these widgets at any time 
by pressing the Dashboard key; by default, that’s F12 on older keyboards (and 
F4 on current keyboard models), but you can modify the key on the Exposé & 
Spaces pane within System Preferences. Snow Leopard also includes a thought-
ful Dashboard icon in the Dock, which you can click to display your widgets. 
(Geez, that sounds kind of racy. Best not to pursue it.)
Figure 2-6 illustrates Dashboard in action. Press the Dashboard key, and 
the widgets appear, ready for you to use. You can add widgets to or delete 
them from your Dashboard by clicking the Add button (which bears a plus 
sign, naturally) at the lower-left corner of the Dashboard screen. When 
you click the Add button, a scrolling menu strip appears at the bottom of 
the Dashboard display, and you can drag new widgets directly onto your 
Dashboard from this menu. It’s also easy to rearrange the widgets that are 
already populating Dashboard by dragging them to the desired spot. Press 
the Dashboard key again to return to your Snow Leopard Desktop.
 
Figure 2-6:

Most widgets have an option button that allows you to change things, such 
as borders, ZIP Codes, display columns, and the like; look for a tiny circle 
with a lowercase letter i. Click this information icon and you can tweak what-
ever options are available for that widget.
To remove a widget, just click the Add button to display the menu strip, and 
you’ll notice a tiny X button appears next to each widget on your Dashboard. 
Click the X button next to the widget you want to remove, and it vanishes 
from the display. You can add it back again at any time from the strip.
 
While you’re adding or deleting widgets, you can also click Manage Widgets, 
which displays a dialog where you can sort your widgets in a list by name or 
date added, disable any widget, and delete a widget (click the red minus icon 
next to the offending widget in the list). Click the More Widgets button to 
jump directly to the widget download area on the Apple Web site.
If you need to use a widget for only a second or two, press the Dashboard 
key and hold it. When you release the key, you’re back to your Desktop.
Apple offers additional widgets that you can download on the Mac OS X 
download site (www.apple.com/macosx). Third-party software developers 
also provide both freeware and shareware widgets.
 
You can also modify the Dashboard key by turning it into a key sequence, 
which is a good thing if you’re already using an application that thrives on 
F12 (or F4, depending on your keyboard). Visit the Exposé & Spaces pane in 
System Preferences, and use the Shift, Control, Option, and Ô keys in con-
junction with the Dashboard key to specify a modifier.
Oh, did I mention that Snow Leopard allows you to create your own Dashboard 
widgets? That’s right, this feature is sure to be a winner amongst the In 
Crowd. Follow these steps to create a new WebClip Dashboard widget from 
your favorite Web site:
 
1. Run Safari and navigate to the site you want to view as a widget.
 
2. Click File➪Open in Dashboard.
 
3. Select the portion of the page you want to include in your widget and 
click Add.
 
 Most Web pages use frames to organize and separate sections of a page, 
so this step allows you to choose the frame with the desired content.
 
4. Drag the handles at the edges of the selection border to resize your 
widget frame to the right size and then click Add.
 
 Bam! Snow Leopard displays your new WebClip widget within 
Dashboard.

Arranging Your Precious Desktop
180
A WebClip widget can include text, graphics, and links, which Dashboard 
updates every time you display your widgets. Think about that for a second: 
Dynamic displays, such as weather maps, cartoons, even the Free Music 
Download image from the iTunes Store, are all good sources of WebClip 
widgets! (That last one is a real timesaver.)
If you click a link in a WebClip widget, Dashboard loads the full Web page in 
Safari, so you can even use WebClips for surfing chores with sites you visit 
often.
Arranging Your Precious Desktop
Consider the layout of the Desktop itself. You can set the options for icon 
placement from the Finder View menu. Just as you can with the options for 
Finder windows that I cover in Chapter 1 of this minibook, you can clean up 
and arrange your Desktop by name, date, size, or kind.
The View Options for the Desktop are different in two ways from the View 
Options for a Finder window in icon view (which I discuss in Chapter 1 of 
this minibook):
 
✦ You choose a background for the Finder from System Preferences.
 
✦ There’s no Always Open check box. Your Desktop always opens in Icon 
view!

Chapter 3: Delving under the Hood 
with System Preferences
In This Chapter
✓ Displaying and customizing settings in System Preferences
✓ Saving your changes
✓ Changing settings
T
he System Preferences window is the place to practice behavior 
modification in Mac OS X. The settings that you specify in System 
Preferences affect the majority of the applications that you use as well as 
the hardware that you connect to your Mac; your Internet and network 
traffic; the appearance and activity on your Desktop; and how Snow 
Leopard handles money, dates, and languages. Oh, and don’t forget your 
screen saver — important stuff!
In this chapter, I discuss the many settings in System Preferences. You 
discover what does what and how you can customize the appearance and 
operation of Mac OS X.
The Preferred Way to Display the Preferences
Apple has made it easy to open the System Preferences window. Just click 
the System Preferences icon (which looks like a number of gears) in the 
Dock, and the window shown in Figure 3-1 appears. You can also open the 
window by clicking the Apple menu and choosing the System Preferences 
item.
 
To display all the System Preferences icons at any time, click the Show All 
button. You can also use the Back and Forward buttons (in the toolbar’s 
upper-left corner) to move backward and forward through the different 
panes you’ve accessed in System Preferences, just as you use the similar 
buttons in a Web browser (yes, just like Safari!).

182
Saving Your Preferences
 
Figure 3-1: 
The System 
Preferences 
window is a 
familiar face 
to any Snow 
Leopard 
user.
 
Although the System Preferences panes are arranged by category when you 
first install Snow Leopard, you can also display the panes in alphabetical 
order — making it easier to choose a pane if you’re unsure what group it’s 
in. To do so, choose View➪Organize Alphabetically. (Note that you can also 
select any pane directly from the View menu.)
 
In fact, you can right-click the System Preferences icon in the Dock to jump 
to any pane from the contextual menu. Wowzers!
Saving Your Preferences
Note that the System Preferences window has no Save or Apply button. 
Illustrating the elegant design of Mac OS X, simply quitting System 
Preferences automatically saves all the changes that you make. (However, 
some panes in System Preferences have an Apply button that you can click 
to apply your changes immediately.) As with any other Mac OS X application, 
you can quit the System Preferences window by pressing Ô+Q or by choosing 
System Preferences➪Quit System Preferences.
Some third-party applications can actually 
install their own groups within your once-
pristine System Preferences window. Naturally, 
I can’t document these invited guests in this 
chapter, but they work the same way as any 
other group within System Preferences. Click 
the icon, adjust any settings as necessary, and 
then close the System Preferences window to 
save your changes.
 Hey, I got bonus icons in my window!

Searching for Specific Settings
Searching for a single button or check box amidst all the settings in System 
Preferences might seem like hunting for the proverbial needle in a haystack, 
but your friends at Apple have added a Search box to the right side of the 
window toolbar. Click in this Search box and type the setting name, like 
screen saver (or even a word that’s generally associated with a setting, like 
power for the Energy Saver settings). Snow Leopard highlights all the icons 
in System Preferences that have anything to do with the search keywords 
you entered, as shown in Figure 3-2. You don’t even have to press Return!
 
Figure 3-2: 
System

highlights 
the panes 
that contain 
your search 
keywords.
 
To reset the Search field for a different keyword, click the X button that 
appears at the right of the Search box.
Getting Personal
The first stop on your tour of the System Preferences window is the Personal 
section. No singles ads here — this section is devoted to settings that you make 
to customize the appearance and operation of your Desktop and login account.
Appearance preferences
The Appearance group appears in Figure 3-3.
These settings are
 
✦ Appearance: From this pop-up menu, choose a color to be used for 
buttons, menus, and windows.
 
✦ Highlight Color: From this pop-up menu, choose a color to be used to 
highlight selected text in fields and pop-up menus.

184
Getting Personal
 
Figure 3-3:

pane.
 
 
✦ Place Scroll Arrows: Select either radio button here to put the scroll 
bar arrow buttons together (at the bottom of the scroll bar, in the lower-
right corner of the window) or at the top and bottom of the scroll bar.
 
✦ Click in the Scroll Bar To: By default, Mac OS X jumps to the next or 
previous page when you click in an empty portion of the scroll bar. 
Select the Jump to the Spot That’s Clicked radio button to scroll the 
document to the approximate position in relation to where you click. 
(You can also choose smooth scrolling, which looks cool, but many folks 
think that it’s too slow compared with the default scrolling speed.) If you 
select the Double-Click a Window’s Title Bar to Minimize check box, you 
can minimize a Finder or application window by simply double-clicking 
the window’s title bar.
 
✦ Number of Recent Items: The default number of recent applications, 
documents, and servers (available from the Recent Items item in the 
Apple menu, which you can read more about in Book I, Chapter 3) is 10. 
To change the default, click any of the pop-up menus here and choose 
up to 50. (Personally, I like 20 or 30 for each.)
 
✦ Use LCD Font Smoothing: By default, this check box is selected, making 
the text on your LCD flat-panel monitor appear more like the printed 
page. If you’re using an older CRT monitor, you can turn off this feature 
to speed up text display slightly.
 
✦ Turn Off Text Smoothing for Font Sizes: Below a certain point size, text 
smoothing isn’t much good for most on-screen fonts. By default, any font 
displayed at 8 point or smaller isn’t smoothed, which is suitable for a 
high-end video card and monitor. You can speed up the display of text 
by turning off text smoothing for fonts up to 12 point.

Desktop and screen saver preferences
Figure 3-4 illustrates the settings in the Desktop & Screen Saver group.
 
Figure 3-4: 
The Desktop 
& Screen 
Saver pane.
 
The settings on the Desktop tab are
 
✦ Current Desktop Picture: You can click a picture in the thumbnail list 
at the right half of the screen to use it as your Desktop background. The 
Desktop is immediately updated, and the thumbnail appears in the well 
(the square box in Figure 3-4). To display a different image collection 
or open a folder of your own images, click the Add Folder button at the 
lower left of the window (which carries a plus sign) and browse for your 
heart’s desire; click Choose to select a folder and display the images it 
contains.
 
✦ Layout: As I explain in Chapter 2 of this minibook, you can tile your 
background image, center it, fill the screen with it, and stretch it to fill 
the screen. (Note that filling the screen may distort the image.) The 
layout control appears only when you’re using your own pictures, so 
you won’t see it if you’re using a Desktop image supplied by Apple.
 
✦ Change Picture: Select this check box to change the Desktop back-
ground automatically after the delay period that you set, including each 
time you log in and each time your Mac wakes up from sleep mode.
 
✦ Random: To display screens randomly, select the Random check box. 
Otherwise, the backgrounds are displayed in the sequence in which they 
appear in the thumbnail strip.

186
Getting Personal
 
✦ Translucent Menu Bar: When selected, this feature turns your Finder 
and application menu bars semi-opaque, allowing them to blend in 
somewhat with your Desktop background. If you’d rather have a solid-
color menu bar, deselect this check box.
Click the Screen Saver tab to see the following settings:
 
✦ Screen Savers: In the Screen Savers list at the left, click the screen saver 
that you want to display an animated Preview of on the right. To try out 
the screen saver in full-screen mode, click the Test button. (You can end 
the test by moving your mouse.) If the screen saver module that you 
select has any configurable settings, click the Options button to display 
them. (A screen saver is configurable if the Options button is selected.)
 
✦ Start Screen Saver: Click and drag the slider here to specify the period 
of inactivity that triggers the screen saver. To disable the screen saver, 
choose the Never setting at the far right of the slider.
 
✦ Use Random Screen Saver: Just what it says: If this check box is 
selected, a different screen saver module is used each time the screen 
saver is activated.
 
✦ Show with Clock: If you want your selected screen saver to display the 
time as well, click this check box to select it.
 
✦ Hot Corners: Click any of the four pop-up menus at the four corners 
of the screen to specify that corner as an activation hot corner (which 
immediately activates the screen saver) or as a disabling hot corner 
(which prevents the screen saver from activating). As long as the mouse 
pointer stays in the disabling hot corner, the screen saver doesn’t kick 
in no matter how long a period of inactivity passes. Note that you can 
also set the Exposé activation corners from here. (For the scoop on 
Exposé, see the upcoming section, “Exposé and Spaces preferences.”)

Settings here are
 
✦ Size: Move this slider to change the overall size of the Dock.
 
✦ Magnification: With this check box selected, a Dock icon magically 
expands, like the national deficit, when you move your mouse cursor 
over it. You can move the Magnification slider to specify just how much 
magnification is right for you.
 
 This feature is useful for helping you click a particular Dock icon if 
you’ve resized the Dock smaller than its default dimensions or if you 
have a large number of items in the Dock.
 
✦ Position on Screen: Choose from three radio buttons to make that crazy 
Dock appear at the left, bottom, or right edge of your Desktop.
 
✦ Minimize Windows Using: By default, Mac OS X animates a window 
when it’s shrunk into the Dock (and when it’s expanded back into a full 
window). From the Minimize Using pop-up menu, you can choose from 
a genie-in-a-bottle effect or a scale-up-or-down-incrementally effect. 
To demonstrate, choose an effect and then click the Minimize button 
(the yellow button in the upper-left corner) on the System Preferences 
window.
 
✦ Animate Opening Applications: By default, Mac OS X has that happy, 
slam-dancing feeling when you launch an application: The application’s 
icon bounces up and down in the Dock two or three times to draw your 
attention and indicate that the application is loading. If you find this 
effervescence overly buoyant or distracting, deselect this check box.
 
✦ Automatically Hide and Show the Dock: If you like, the Dock can stay 
hidden until you need it, thus reclaiming a significant amount of Desktop 
space for your application windows. Select this check box to hide the 
Dock whenever you’re not using it.
 
 To display a hidden Dock, move your mouse pointer over the edge of 
the Desktop where it’s hiding.
 
You can also change these Dock preference settings from the Apple menu.
Exposé and Spaces preferences
Figure 3-6 illustrates the Exposé and Dashboard settings that you can configure 
in this group. You can use Exposé to view all the application windows that 
you’re using at one time so that you can select a new active window. Or you 
can move all windows aside so that you can see your Desktop. Dashboard 
presents a number of mini-applications (or widgets), which you can summon 
and hide with a single key. Spaces makes it easy to create multiple desktops 
that you can switch between, each of which has its own set of preloaded 
applications.

Figure 3-6: 
Set your 
Dashboard 
and Exposé 
preferences 
here.
 
On the Exposé pane, the settings are
 
✦ Active Screen Corners: These four pop-up menus operate just like the 
Hot Corners/Active Screen Corners in the Desktop & Screen Savers 
pane, but they control the operation of the Snow Leopard Dashboard 
and Exposé features. Click one to specify that corner as an All Windows 
corner (which displays all windows on your Desktop), an Application 
Windows corner (which displays only the windows from the active 
application), a Desktop corner (which moves all windows to the outside 
of the screen to uncover your Desktop), or a Dashboard corner (which 
displays your Dashboard widgets). Note that you can also set the Screen 
Saver Start and Disable corners from here.
 
✦ Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts: Click each pop-up menu to set the key 
sequences (and mouse button settings) for all three Exposé functions as 
well as the Dashboard.
 
 You’re not limited to just the keyboard and mouse shortcuts on the 
pop-up menus — press the Shift, Control, Option, and Ô keys while 
a pop-up menu is open, and you see these modifiers appear as menu 
choices! (Heck, you can even combine modifiers, such as Ô+Shift+F9 
instead of just F9.)
On the Spaces pane (as shown in Figure 3-7), you find the following settings:

pane.
 
 
✦ Enable Spaces: In order to use Spaces, select this check box.
 
✦ Show Spaces in Menu Bar: When this check box is selected, Snow 
Leopard displays the Spaces desktop number you’re currently using 
in the Finder menu bar. You can click the number in the menu bar to 
switch to another Spaces desktop or to open the Spaces Preferences 
pane.
 
✦ Rows buttons: To add a row of Spaces desktops to the Spaces grid, click 
the Add button with the plus sign. (By default, Spaces starts with two 
desktops enabled, so new rows and columns are numbered beginning with 
three.) To delete a row, click the Delete button (which bears a minus 
sign).
 
✦ Columns buttons: To add a column of Spaces desktops to the Spaces 
grid, click the Add (plus) button. Click the Delete (minus) button to 
remove a column from the grid.
 
 If you choose to remove a column or row, Snow Leopard alerts you that 
the bindings on the deleted desktop(s) will be reassigned.
 
✦ Add/Remove Application: Click the Add Application button (the button 
with the plus sign under the Application Assignments list) to add an 
application to one of your Spaces desktops. You can select which desk-
top should include an application by clicking the up/down arrows next 
to the Space column for that application’s entry. Just click the desired 
desktop from the pop-up menu that appears. To remove an application, 
click it in the Application Assignments list to select it and then click the 
Remove Application button (which sports a minus sign).

190

 Spaces can even add an application to all your desktops — choose Every 
Space from the pop-up menu.
 
✦ Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts: Click each pop-up menu to set the key 
sequences (and mouse button settings) for all three Spaces functions.
 
 As with Dashboard and Exposé keyboard and mouse shortcuts, you can 
press the Shift, Control, Option, and Ô keys while the box is open to dis-
play modified choices.
 
✦ When Switching to an Application: When selected, this check box 
allows you to switch applications between Spaces desktops using the 
Ô+Tab shortcut. Snow Leopard will jump to the desktop that has an 
open window for the application you choose, even if that desktop is not 
currently active.
Language & Text preferences
The Language & Text group appears in Figure 3-8 with the following tabs:
 
✦ Language: Choose the preferred order for language use in menus and 
dialogs as well as the standards that Mac OS X will use for each script 
style.
 
✦ Text: Specify character combinations that will be automatically replaced 
with special characters. For example, Snow Leopard will automatically 
replace the combination TM with the special character ™. You can also 
choose a language for spell-checking and turn on “smart” quotes (where 
Snow Leopard chooses double or single quotation marks for you).

✦ Formats: Find these settings here:
 
• Dates: You can select a region and use its date conventions (month-
day-year versus day-month-year) or you can click the Customize 
button to build a custom format for both the long date (Saturday, 
September 24, 2009) and short date (9/24/2009) used throughout Mac 
OS X. The changes you make are reflected immediately in the sample 
box at the left.
 
• Times: Click Customize to select a region to use the preset time con-
ventions. You can choose 12-hour or 24-hour (military) time formats, 
change the time separator (colons, a period, or a dash), and specify 
different suffixes for morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.).
 
• Numbers: These convention settings determine the separators used 
for large numbers or numbers with decimals, as well as the currency 
symbol that you want to use and where it appears in a number. You 
can also choose between standard (U.S.) and metric measurement 
systems.
 
✦ Input Sources: Each check box toggles the keyboard layouts available 
from the Input menu. (To display the Input menu on the Finder menu 
bar, click the Show Input Menu in Menu Bar check box to select it.) Click 
the Keyboard Shortcuts button to toggle the shortcuts for switching lay-
outs and input methods.
Security preferences
The Security group is shown in Figure 3-9.
 
Figure 3-9: 
Set Security 
preferences 
here.
 

192
Getting Personal
Settings here are divided into three tabs:
 
✦ General: To add an extra layer of password security to a laptop (or a 
Mac in a public area), select the Require Password after Sleep or Screen 
Saver Begins check box. Mac OS X then requires that you enter your 
login password before the system returns from a sleep state or exits a 
screen saver. Click the pop-up delay menu to specify when the pass-
word requirement will kick in (it’s immediate by default). If you’re an 
admin-level user, you can set the global security features in the For All 
Accounts on This Computer section, which affect all user accounts. You 
can choose to disable the automatic login feature, force Mac OS X to 
require a login password each time that a System Preferences pane is 
opened, automatically log off any user after a certain amount of inactiv-
ity, or use secure (encrypted) virtual memory on your hard drive. You 
can also mark the Disable Location Services check box to turn off the 
Location feature, preventing applications from using information based 
on your Mac’s current location.
 
 Don’t want small fingers accidentally controlling your Mac with the 
Apple Remote? If you don’t need the Remote on a regular basis, click the 
Disable Remote Control Infrared Receiver check box to select it. (But 
don’t forget to turn your IR receiver back on for your next movie night!)
 
✦ FileVault: These controls allow you to set the master password for 
FileVault encryption within the current user’s Home folder, which makes 
it virtually impossible for others to access those files. Only an admin-
level user can set the master password. After the master password 
is set, you can click the Turn On FileVault button to select FileVault 
encryption for the user who’s currently logged in; the user’s Login 
password becomes his FileVault password as well.
 
✦ Firewall: As I discuss in Book V, Chapter 6, Mac OS X includes a built-in 
firewall, which you can enable from this pane.
 
 To turn the firewall off entirely, simply click the Stop button. This is 
the very definition of Not a Good Thing, and I always recommend 
that any Mac hooked up to a network or the Internet have the system 
firewall turned on. (The only exception is if you’re using a net-
work that you know to be secure and your access to the Internet is 
through a router or sharing device with its own built-in firewall.)
 
 When the firewall is enabled, click the Advanced button to set fire-
wall options.
 
 To turn the firewall on with only Mac OS X application exclusions, click 
Block All Incoming Connections — only the sharing services you select 
on the Sharing pane in System Preferences are allowed through your 
firewall.) This is a good choice for the most security-conscious Mac 
owner, but your firewall will block third-party applications that try to 
access your network or the Internet.

Book II
Chapter 3
Delving Under the 
Hood with System 
Preferences
193
Getting Personal
 
 To turn the firewall on with exclusions, click Automatically Allow 
Signed Software to Receive Incoming Connections. (Yep, this is the 
correct option for just about every Mac owner.) Any connection to 
a service (such as Web Sharing) or an application (such as iChat) 
that isn’t listed is blocked, but you can enable access for third-party 
applications on an as-needed basis.
 
 In firewall-speak, these entries are rules because they determine what’s 
allowed to pass through to your Mac.
 
 It’s easy to enable communications with a Mac OS X service: Just use the 
Sharing pane within System Preferences to turn on a service, and Snow 
Leopard automatically configures your firewall to allow communica-
tions. I describe the Sharing pane in detail later in this chapter.
 
 To add a third-party application, click the Advanced button at the 
bottom of the Firewall pane; then click the button with the plus sign. 
Navigate to the application that needs to communicate with the outside 
world. Click the application to select it and then click Add. To delete 
an application, select it in the list and click the button with the minus 
sign. Remember, you don’t have to add any of the applications provided 
by Apple with Snow Leopard, such as Apple Mail, iChat, or Safari; only 
third-party applications that you install yourself need a firewall rule.
 
 You can edit the rule for a specific service or application by clicking 
the rule at the right side of the entry. By default, the rule reads Allow 
Incoming Connections (including both your local network and the 
Internet); however, when you click the rule, you can also choose Block 
Incoming Connections to temporarily deny access to that application.
 
 If you suddenly can’t connect to other computers or share files that you 
originally could share, review the rules that you’ve selected from this 
pane. You can also verify that everything’s shipshape in the Sharing 
pane in System Preferences, which I cover later in this chapter.
Spotlight preferences
The Spotlight group is shown in Figure 3-10.
Settings here are
 
✦ Search Results tab: You can select or deselect the check boxes next to 
each of the categories to display or hide each category in the Spotlight 
search menu and dialog. Click and drag the categories to the order 
that you prefer. For example, I like to see matching documents imme-
diately after matching applications in the Spotlight dialog, so I dragged 
Documents to the second position in the list. You can also specify a 
different keyboard shortcut for the Spotlight menu and window.

194
It’s All about the Hardware
 
✦ Privacy tab: If you don’t want to display the contents of certain folders 
in the Spotlight — for instance, if you work in a hospital setting and you 
can’t allow access to patient information and medical records — click 
the Add button (which carries a plus sign) and specify the folder or disk 
you want to exclude from Spotlight searches. Alternatively, just drag the 
folders or disks to exclude into the list from a Finder window.

run an AppleScript that you select, or ignore the disc.
 
✦ When You Insert a Blank DVD: Use this feature to specify the action 
that your Mac takes when you load a recordable DVD.
 
✦ When You Insert a Music CD: Choices from this pop-up menu specify 
what action Mac OS X takes when you load an audio CD. By default, 
iTunes launches.
 
✦ When You Insert a Picture CD: Choices from this pop-up menu specify 
what action Mac OS X takes when you load a picture CD. By default, 
iPhoto launches.
 
✦ When You Insert a Video DVD: Choices from this pop-up menu specify 
what action Mac OS X takes when you load a DVD movie. By default,

refresh rate (from the, ahem, Refresh Rate pop-up menu). Again, 
generally the higher the refresh rate, the better. Move the Brightness 
slider to adjust the brightness level of your display. (Note that these 
settings are different depending on what type of display you’re using. 
For example, a Mac with a CRT monitor has more settings to choose 
among than a flat-panel LCD system.)
 
 Select the Show Displays in Menu Bar check box if you’ll be switching 
resolutions and color levels often — this means you, Ms. Image Editor 
and Mr. Web Designer!
 
✦ Color: Click a display color profile that will control the colors on 
your monitor. To load a profile, click the Open Profile button. To 
create a custom ColorSync profile and calibrate the colors that you 
see on your monitor, click the Calibrate button to launch the Display 
Calibrator. (You can also launch it from your Utilities folder within your 
Applications folder.) This easy-to-use assistant walks you step-by-step 
through the process of creating a ColorSync profile matched to your 
monitor’s gamma and white-point values.
Energy Saver preferences
The Energy Saver group is shown in Figure 3-13.
 
Figure 3-13:

Move the Computer Sleep slider to specify when Mac OS X should switch to 
sleep mode. The Never setting here disables sleep mode entirely. To choose 
a separate delay period for blanking your monitor, drag the Display Sleep 
delay slider to the desired period. You can also power down the hard drive 
to conserve energy and prevent wear and tear (an especially good feature 
for laptop owners).

If you want to start or shut down your Mac at a scheduled time, click the 
Schedule button. Mark the desired schedule (the Start Up or Wake check 
box and the Shut Down/Sleep check box) to select them; then click the up 
and down arrows next to the time display to set the trigger time. Click OK to 
return to the Energy Saver pane.
Some of the settings can toggle events that control Snow Leopard’s sleep 
mode, including a network connection by the network administrator (Wake 
for Network Access). If you want the display to dim before your Mac goes 
to sleep, select the Automatically Reduce Brightness before Display Goes to 
Sleep check box. You can also set Mac OS X to restart automatically after a 
power failure, which is a good idea if you’re running a Web or File Transfer 
Protocol (FTP) server on your machine. (Read more about this in Book VIII, 
Chapter 4.) If you’re running a Mac laptop, click the Show Battery Status in 
the Menu Bar check box to select it.
 
Mac laptop owners can set two separate Energy Saver configurations:
 
✦ Battery Power: Applies when their Mac is running on battery power)
 
✦ Power Adapter: Kicks in when the laptop is connected to an AC outlet
 
 You can also choose an Optimization mode, which is an easy way of 
immediately setting your MacBook for better performance or best pos-
sible energy savings.

The two tabs include
 
✦ Keyboard: Move the Key Repeat Rate slider to alter the rate at which a 
keystroke repeats. You can also adjust the Delay until Repeat slider to 
alter how long a key must be held down before it repeats. If you change 
your keyboard, you can always run the Keyboard Setup Assistant by 
clicking the Change Keyboard Type button — you can also set up a wire-
less Bluetooth keyboard from this pane.
 
 Laptop owners (as well as Mac owners with newer Apple keyboards) 
can set the F1–F12 keys for applications by enabling the Use the F1–F12 
Keys to Control Software Features check box. If you select this feature, 
you have to hold down the Function (or Fn) key while pressing the F1 
through F12 keys to use the regular hardware keys.
 
 If you have a MacBook Pro, you can choose to turn the ambient key-
board lighting on and off from this pane, or turn off keyboard lighting 
after an inactivity delay that you set.
 
✦ Keyboard Shortcuts: If you’re a power user who appreciates the lure of 
the keyboard shortcut, you can edit your shortcuts here.
 
 Looking for even more keyboard customizing possibilities? Select the All 
Controls radio button on the Keyboard Shortcuts pane to see additional 
keys to use.

✦ Mouse: Drag the Tracking Speed slider to determine how fast the mouse 
tracks across your Desktop. You can also drag the Double-Click Speed 
slider to determine how fast you must click your mouse to cause a 
double-click. Drag the Scrolling Speed slider to specify the rate at which 
the contents of windows will scroll. Lefties might want to change the 
primary mouse button for aftermarket pointing devices. You can also 
zoom the display with your Mighty Mouse scroll ball while holding down 
the key of your choice — a great option for image editing. To install a 
wireless Bluetooth mouse, click the Set Up Bluetooth Mouse button, 
which runs the Bluetooth device Set Up assistant.
 
✦ (Optional) Trackpad: This tab is available only to Mac laptop owners, 
allowing this elite crowd to customize the tracking speed and double-
click speed for their trackpads. You can also set your MacBook’s trackpad 
for two-fingered scrolling (vertical and horizontal) and two-fingered 
zooming. (I imagine both will someday become Olympic events.) You 
can also enable clicking and right-clicking by using the trackpad.
 
 I suggest that you leave the Ignore Accidental Trackpad Input check box 
selected to prevent spurious movements and clicks — and, if you use a 
mouse with your laptop, you can elect to disable the trackpad while the 
mouse is connected. This helps to prevent accidental copies or moves 
within a Finder window!
 
✦ (Optional) Bluetooth: If you’re using a wireless Bluetooth mouse or 
keyboard, you can check the battery level on these devices from this 
panel. You can also specify whether your Bluetooth keyboard or mouse 
wakes your Mac from sleep mode. If you don’t have a Bluetooth card or 
external adapter, this tab doesn’t appear.
Printing and fax preferences

(no great shockers there). To add a new printer or fax connection, click the 
Add button, which bears a plus sign — Snow Leopard launches the Browser. 
You can read more about printer and fax setup in Book VII, Chapter 4.
The other settings here are
 
✦ Share This Printer on the Network: Click this check box to share 
this printer with other computers on your network. To specify who 
can use your shared printer, click the Set Permissions button. System 
Preferences switches to the Sharing pane, where you can add or remove 
users from the permission list.
 
✦ Default Printer: Click this pop-up menu to select the installed printer that 
acts as the default printer throughout your system. If you choose Last 
Printer Used, Mac OS X uses the printer that received the last print job.
 
✦ Default Paper Size: Will that be US Letter or Tabloid? Click this pop-up 
menu to specify the default paper size for future print jobs.
If you’ve added a fax entry to the list, click the entry to set up the fax send/
receive functions built into Snow Leopard. To receive faxes on your Mac, 
you must first set up a fax connection; then click the Receive Options button 
and select the Receive Faxes on This Computer check box.
After faxing is turned on, you can configure the other settings from the Print 
& Fax pane and the Receive Options sheet. These settings include
 
✦ Fax Number: Enter the phone number that others call to reach your Mac.
 
✦ When a Fax Arrives: You can determine how many times the phone 
rings before your Mac answers the incoming call. By default, Mac OS X 
saves the incoming fax to your Shared Faxes folder, but you can change 
that location — or you can choose to print the incoming fax on the 
printer that you specify. Heck, if you like, you can send your fax to both 
destinations (a disk folder and a printer) or even mail the fax to the 
e-mail address you specify.
 
If you send and receive a large number of faxes, make sure you select the 
Show Fax Status in Menu Bar check box.
You can also allow other computer users on your local network to send 
faxes through your Mac. Select the Share This Fax on the Network check 
box, and your Mac’s fax modem appears when the other users add a fax 
connection.

when the volume keys are pressed on your Mac’s keyboard (or from the 
Volume slider). If you use Front Row with your Mac, you can select or 
deselect the Front Row audio effects from this pane.
 
✦ Output: Use these settings to choose which audio controller your Mac 
uses for playing sound. Unless you’ve installed additional audio hard-
ware, this remains set to Built-in Audio or Internal Speakers. You can 
adjust the balance between the left and right channels for the selected 
output controller.
 
✦ Input: These settings allow you to specify an input source. Unless your 
Mac includes a Line In input source, leave this set to your Internal 
Microphone. Drag the Input Volume slider to increase or decrease the 
input signal volume; the input level display provides you with real-
time sound levels. If your Mac is in a location with a large amount of 
background noise, click the Use Ambient Noise Reduction check box to 
improve the quality of your audio input.

click the pop-up menu to specify manual or automatic synchronization. (To 
manually sync, click Sync Now.) You can also specify which categories 
of data you want to sync. Naturally, the fewer categories you choose, the 
less time it takes to sync. To register a computer so that you can sync

your access privileges for your public folder by selecting or deselecting 
the Allow Others to Write Files in Your Public Folder check box, and you 
can add a password that others have to enter before they can access 
your public folder. For a complete description of iDisk, see Book V, 
Chapter 4.
 
 I recommend that you click the iDisk Sync Start button on the iDisk tab 
to enable the Snow Leopard iDisk syncing function (which creates a 
local copy of your iDisk on your Mac). Select the Update Automatically 
option; this option allows iDisk to run much faster because Mac OS X 
can read and write by using your local iDisk copy on your hard drive. 
Your Mac regularly synchronizes the data on your local hard drive 
across the Internet with the iDisk on the Apple server. To make sure that 
you’re always using the most recent copy of a file on your iDisk, select 
the Always Keep the Most Recent Version of a File check box.
 
✦ Back to My Mac: From this list, you can control file and screen sharing

Sharing the Joy: Internet & Network
You can choose an existing Location by clicking the Location pop-up menu 
at the top of the dialog, or you can create and edit your Locations by choosing 
Edit Locations from this pop-up menu. (Automatic is the default, and it does 
a pretty good job of figuring out what settings you need.) As I mention in 
Book I, Chapter 3, creating Locations makes it easy to completely reconfigure 
your Network preferences when you connect your computer to other 
networks — for example, when you take your laptop to a branch office. You 
can also set up Locations to accommodate different ISP dial-up telephone 
numbers in different towns.
 
If you need to create a new Location that’s very similar to an existing 
Location, click the Location pop-up menu and choose Edit Locations. Then 
select the Location that you want to copy, click the Action button (bearing 
the gear symbol), and choose Duplicate Location from the pop-up menu. The 
new Location that you create contains all the same settings (without several 
minutes of retyping), so you can easily edit it and make minor changes 
quickly.
 
You can choose locations from the Apple menu — a useful trick for laptop 
road warriors.
Ethernet network settings
When you select Ethernet from the Services list, the Status pane shows your 
connection information. Because most networks have a DHCP server to pro-
vide automatic settings, you probably don’t have to change anything; Snow 
Leopard does a good job at making introductions automatic between your 
Mac and both a local network and the Internet.
 
Notice the very attractive Assist Me . . . button at the bottom of the Network 
pane? It’s there for a very good reason: Click it, and Snow Leopard launches 
a network connection and troubleshooting assistant that guides you step-
by-step. If your ISP doesn’t provide you with instructions on setting up your 
Internet connection — or that oh-so-smart Mr. Network Administrator is too 
busy to help connect your Mac to your office network — use both this book 
and the network assistant to do the job yourself!
Need to make manual changes to your network settings? Click the Advanced 
button (it’s like opening the hood on your car). The tabs on the Advanced 
sheet include
 
✦ TCP/IP: These settings are provided either automatically (by using 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [DHCP]) or manually (by using 
settings provided by your network administrator). For more details on 
TCP/IP settings, see Book V, Chapter 1 and Book VI, Chapter 2.
 
✦ DNS: The settings that you enter here specify the DNS servers and search 
domains used by your ISP. Typically, any changes you make here are 

Book II
Chapter 3
Delving Under the 
Hood with System 
Preferences

Sharing the Joy: Internet & Network
requested by your ISP or your network administrator. Click the Add buttons 
(with the plus signs) to add a new DNS server address or search domain.
 
✦ WINS: Dating back a few years, WINS is a name server required for 
computers running NetBIOS (practically dinosaurs in the computer 
timeline), and likely only those computers running a version of Windows 
older than Windows 2000. If that sounds like gobbledygook to you, you 
need to enter something on this tab only if instructed to do so by your 
network administrator.
 
✦ 802.1X: This tab controls which wireless networking security protocols 
that you may need to connect to a third-party wireless base station or 
access point. Click the Add Configuration button (with our friend the 
plus sign) to create a new wireless connection configuration, including 
your username, password, and the protocols that need to be used. 
Note that these settings are set automatically when making a wireless 
connection with an Apple AirPort Extreme base station.
 
✦ Proxies: Network proxy servers are used as part of a firewall configuration 
to help keep your network secure, but in most cases, changing them can 
cause you to lose Internet functionality if you enter the wrong settings.
 
 Most folks using a telephone modem, cable modem, or digital subscriber 
line (DSL) connection should leave these settings alone. Enable and 
change these settings only at the request of your network administrator, 
who should supply you the location of a PAC file to automate the process.
 
 If you’ve enabled your Mac OS X firewall and you use FTP to transfer 
files, select the Passive FTP Mode check box on the Proxies pane. I 
recommend that you select this setting to allow downloading from some 
Web pages as well.
 
✦ Ethernet: From this pane, you can configure the settings for your 
Ethernet network interface card. I strongly recommend that you leave 
the Configure pop-up menu set to Automatically (unless specifically told 
to set things manually by your system administrator or that nice person 
from Apple tech support).
Modem network settings
When you select Modem from the Services list, you can enter the telephone 
number, account name, and password provided by your ISP. In most cases, 
that’s all the information you need. . . . But if you need to make a manual 
change, click the Advanced button to display these tabs:
 
✦ Modem: Click the Modem pop-up menu and choose the brand and 
model of your modem. If Mac OS X detects an internal modem, it’s used 
by default.
 
 I strongly recommend that you select the Enable Error Correction and 
Compression in Modem check box; also select Wait for Dial Tone before 
Dialing from the Dial Mode pop-up menu. These settings provide you 
with the best performance and the fastest speeds.

206
Sharing the Joy: Internet & Network
 
 You can also select tone or pulse dialing and whether you want to hear 
the two modems conversing. (If the caterwauling bothers you, turn off 
the Sound option.)
 
✦ DNS: These settings are the same as those I cover earlier, in the section 
“Ethernet network settings.”
 
✦ WINS: Again, you’re likely to never need these WINS settings, so 
make changes on this tab only if instructed to do so by your network 
administrator.
 
✦ Proxies: Some ISPs use proxy servers for their dial-up accounts to 
maintain security, but changing these settings willy-nilly is inviting 
disaster. Leave them disabled unless given specific instructions on 
what to set by your ISP.
 
✦ PPP: These settings are used for a Point-to-Point Protocol connection 
over a telephone modem. Again, your ISP provides you with the right 
values to enter here.
 
 If you’re concerned about who’s using your Internet connection — or 
you want to add an extra layer of security when you dial out — select 
the Prompt for Password after Dialing check box on the PPP tab, and 
Mac OS X prompts you each time for your Internet account password.
I recommend that you select the Show Modem Status in Menu Bar check 
box on the Modem status pane, which gives you a visual reference on your 
connection status.
FireWire and AirPort network settings
The FireWire and AirPort settings on the Advanced sheet are the same 
as those for Ethernet that I cover earlier in this chapter. However, three 
settings are on the AirPort status pane that I cover here:
 
✦ Network Name: Snow Leopard handles wireless connections automatically 
in most cases; if possible, it connects to the last wireless network you 
joined. If that network isn’t available or there are others to choose from, 
Snow Leopard displays a dialog asking you which available network you 
want to join. If you want to join only one or more preferred networks 
(for security or convenience reasons), click the Advanced button and 
click the Add button (which bears a plus sign) to enter the wireless 
network name and password.
 
✦ Turn AirPort Off: Okay, here’s the honest truth — wireless networking 
is a significant drain on a laptop battery! If you’re sure you’re not going 
to use your MacBook’s AirPort network hardware in the near future, 
you can click this button to activate and deactivate your Mac’s network 
hardware. Turn off AirPort if you don’t need it, and your laptop will 
thank you. (Just turn it back on using this same button when you need it 
or use the AirPort status menu in the Finder menu bar.)

Book II

✦ Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar: Hey, speaking of the AirPort Status 
Menu in the Finder Menu Bar . . . select this check box to display it! You 
can immediately see the relative signal strength of your connection, 
switch between available wireless networks, and turn off your AirPort 
hardware to conserve your battery power (without digging this deep in 
System Preferences).
Bluetooth preferences
If your Mac has Bluetooth hardware available, the Bluetooth group, as 
shown in Figure 3-18, appears. If you don’t have Bluetooth hardware, you’ll 
be blissfully unaware of the existence of this group because the Bluetooth 
icon won’t appear in your System Preferences window.
 
Figure 3-20: 
The 
Bluetooth 
pane 
appears if 
your Mac 
is equipped 
with 
Bluetooth.
 
The choices on this pane include
 
✦ Device listing: From this pane, you can opt to allow other Bluetooth 
devices to discover your Mac (with the Discoverable check box). All 
recognized Bluetooth devices in range appear in the list, and you can 
configure or disconnect them. You can also set up a new Bluetooth device 
from here by clicking the Set Up New Device button. Also, if you like, Snow 
Leopard can display a Bluetooth status menu in the Finder menu bar.
 
 MacBook owners who want to conserve power can disable Bluetooth 
entirely. Just click the Off check box and you save a significant amount 
of battery time!
 
✦ Advanced sheet: Click the Advanced button to display another group 
of settings. The Open Bluetooth Setup Assistant check box determines 
whether Snow Leopard automatically launches the Bluetooth Setup 
Assistant when no Bluetooth devices are recognized. If you’re using a 
Bluetooth mouse and keyboard (as you might on an iMac), you can wake 
your Mac using these devices. You can set Snow Leopard to alert you if 

208
Sharing the Joy: Internet & Network
an audio request is received from a Bluetooth device, and you can share 
an Internet connection with connected devices.
 
 You can also edit your Bluetooth Serial Ports from the Advanced sheet, 
allowing you to use a Bluetooth connection as a virtual serial port. You 
can add or remove serial services from the Serial Port sheet, as well.
Sharing preferences
Figure 3-21 illustrates the Sharing preferences.
 
Figure 3-21:

settings.
 
Click the Edit button to change the default network name assigned to your 
Mac during the installation process. Your current network name is listed in 
the Computer Name text field.
Each entry in the services list controls a specific type of sharing, includ-
ing DVD or CD Sharing, File Sharing (with other Macs and PCs running 
Windows), Web Sharing, Screen Sharing, Remote Login, Remote Management 
(using Apple Remote Desktop), Remote Apple Events, Xgrid Sharing, Internet 
Sharing, Bluetooth Sharing, Scanner Sharing, and Printer Sharing. To turn on 
any of these services, select the On check box for that service. To turn off a 
service, click the corresponding On check box to deselect it.
From a security standpoint, I highly recommend that you enable only those 
services that you actually use. Each service you enable automatically opens 
your Snow Leopard firewall for that service. A Mark’s Maxim to remember:
 
Poking too many holes in your firewall is not A Good Thing.

When you click one of the services in the list, the right side of the Sharing 
pane changes to display the settings you can specify for that particular 
service. Note that some services may be disabled — for example, if you 
don’t have Bluetooth hardware installed on your Mac, the Bluetooth sharing 
service isn’t available.
Tweaking the System
The last section of the System Preferences window covers system-wide 
settings that affect all users and the overall operation of Mac OS X.
Accounts preferences
The Accounts group is illustrated in Figure 3-22.
 
Figure 3-22: 
Configuring 
accounts is 
easy from 
System

Each user on your system has an entry in this list. The panes and settings 
here change, depending on the access level of the selected account. They 
can include
 
✦ Password pane: Click in these text fields to enter or edit the account 
name, password, and password hint for the selected user.
 
 Click the Address Book Card Open button to edit the card that you mark 
in the Address Book as My Card. Mac OS X launches the Address Book, 
and you can edit your card to your heart’s content. (For the complete 
scoop on the Mac OS X Address Book, see Book I, Chapter 6.)
 
 You can set a different MobileMe account name and password for each user 
account from this pane as well. If you’re sharing your Mac with a number of 
other users, each person can set up his or her own MobileMe account!

210
Tweaking the System
 
 If you have administrator access, you can enable Parental Controls for 
the selected user account or open the Parental Controls pane. (More on 
Parental Controls later in this section as well as in Chapter 5 of Book II.)
 
✦ Picture well: From the Picture well — the square area to the right of the 
Account list — you can choose one of the thumbnail images provided by 
Apple to represent you, or drag a photo in from iPhoto. Click the well to 
display the thumbnails. Click Edit Picture to drag a new image from the 
Finder or take a video snapshot using your Mac’s iSight camera.
 
✦ Login Items pane: The applications and documents that you add to 
this list launch automatically each time that the current user logs in to 
Mac OS X. To add an application, click the Add button (which carries 
a plus sign), navigate to the desired application and select it, and then 
click the Add button. (Alternatively, you can simply drag an item from a 
Finder window into the Login Items list.) To remove an application from 
the list, click to select it and then click the Remove button (which has 
a minus sign). Each application can be launched in a hidden state — its 
window doesn’t appear on the Desktop. To toggle an item as hidden or 
visible, select the Hide check box next to the desired application. The 
order that Login Items are launched can be changed by dragging entries 
in the list into the desired sequence.
 
 Note that a user must be logged in to view and change the items on 
the Login Items pane — even an Administrator-level user can’t access 
another user account’s Login items!
 
 You can even set up Login Items directly from the Dock! Control-click 
(or right-click) the desired Dock icon to display the pop-up menu and 
then click Open at Login.
 
✦ Login Options pane: Look for the button with the little house icon, 
lower left. Click it to set a number of global options that control how 
users log in. For example, you can choose to display either a Name and 
Password field on the Login screen (which means that the user must 
actually type in the correct username) or a list of users, from which a 
person can select a user ID. (If security is a consideration, use the Name 
and Password option.) You can also add VoiceOver spoken interface 
support at the Login screen, making it easier for physically challenged 
users to log in to this Mac.
 
If you choose, you can log in automatically as the selected user by clicking the 
Automatically Login <Username> pop-up menu and choosing your account. 
(Not a particularly secure feature for MacBook owners, but convenient as all 
get-out.)
The Login Options panel also allows you to enable or disable Fast User 
Switching (which I discuss in Book II, Chapter 4), and you can prevent 
anyone from restarting or shutting down the Mac from the Login screen by 
selecting the Hide the Restart and Shut Down Buttons check box.

The three tabs here are
 
✦ Date & Time: To set the current date, click the date within the mini-
calendar; to set the system time, click in the field above the clock and 
type the current time.
 
 You can’t set these values manually if you use a network time server. To 
automatically set your Mac’s system time and date from a network time 
server, select the Set Date & Time Automatically check box and then 
choose a server from the pop-up menu that corresponds to your location. 
(Of course, you need an Internet connection to use a network time server.)
 
✦ Time Zone: Click your approximate location on the world map to choose 
a time zone or click the Closest City pop-up menu and choose the city 
that’s closest to you (and shares your same time zone). Alternatively, 
select the Set Time Zone Automatically Using Current Location check 
box — a real convenience for MacBook owners who are constantly 
traveling.
 
✦ Clock: If you select the Show the Date and Time in Menu Bar check box, 
you can choose to view the time in text or icon format. You can also 
optionally display seconds, the date, AM/PM, and the day of the week; 
have the time separator characters flash; or use a clock based on 24 
hours.

212
Tweaking the System
 
 Personally, I get a big kick out of my Mac announcing the time on the 
hour . . . plus, it helps pull me back into the real world. (You have to eat 
sooner or later.) Anyway, if you’d like this helpful reminder as well, select 
the Announce the Time check box on the Clock pane, and click the pop-up 
menu to select an hour, half-hour, or quarter-hour announcement.
Parental Controls preferences
Click a standard level user account in the list to enable or configure Parental 
Controls for that user. Figure 3-24 shows the Parental Controls settings. 
(Parental Controls are disabled for administrator accounts and the Guest 
account.)
 
Figure 3-24: 
You can 
assign 
Parental

I discuss the Parental Control settings in detail in Chapter 5 of Book II. You 
can use these settings to restrict a user’s access to certain applications, or 
limit Mail and iChat communications to specific individuals. An administrator 
can also switch a user account to the Simple Finder, making Snow Leopard 
much easier to navigate (and limiting the amount of damage a mischievous 
or malicious user can inflict on your system).
Software Update preferences
The Software Update settings are shown in Figure 3-25. (Oh, and don’t forget 
that you need an active Internet connection.)

214
Tweaking the System
The two tabs here are
 
✦ Speech Recognition: This pane has two tabs of its own: Settings and 
Commands. With Speakable Items toggled on, you can control Snow 
Leopard with spoken commands.
 
• Settings tab: If you have more than one microphone, you can select 
which one you want to use as well as set the input volume with the 
Calibrate button. You can change the Listening key (Esc by default) 
and specify whether your Mac should listen only while the key is 
pressed or whether the Listening Key toggles listening on and off. 
You can also change the name of your computer (using the Keyword 
box) and whether that name is required before a command. From the 
Play This Sound pop-up menu, you can indicate what sound effect 
Mac OS X plays when it recognizes a speech command. (Optionally, 
Snow Leopard can confirm the command by speaking it if you select 
the Speak Command Acknowledgement check box.)
 
• Commands tab: Here, you can select which types of commands are 
available as well as whether exact wording of command names is 
required. Click the self-named button to open the Speakable Items 
Folder from this pane. Read more about these settings in Book VIII, 
Chapter 3.
 
✦ Text to Speech: Here’s a fun pane. Click a voice from the System Voice 
pop-up menu, and Mac OS X uses that voice to speak to you from dialogs 
and applications. You can set the Speaking Rate (from Slow to Fast) and 
play a sample by clicking the Play button. (Try Zarvox, Bubbles, and 
Pipe Organ.)
 
 The Announce When Alerts are Displayed feature actually speaks the 
text within alert dialogs; to configure spoken alerts, click the Set Alert 
Options button. You can optionally add a phrase before the text, which 
you can choose from the Phrase pop-up menu. To add a phrase to the 
list, like Don’t Panic!, choose Edit Phrase List from the list. Move the 
Delay slider to specify how much time your Mac waits before reading 
the dialog to you.
 
 You can also optionally announce when an application wants your atten-
tion, and Snow Leopard can speak the text that’s currently selected 
within an application when you press a key that you specify.
This pane also provides a couple of convenient shortcut buttons that take 
you to other “speech centers” within System Preferences — specifically, the 
Date & Time and Universal Access panes.
Startup Disk preferences

To select a startup disk, click the desired startup drive from the scrolling 
icon list.
Mac OS X displays the version numbers of each system and the physical 
drives where each system resides. Select the Network Startup icon if you 
want to boot from a System folder on your local network; typically, such a 
folder is created by your network administrator. If you’ve set up a Windows 
partition on your hard drive using Boot Camp, the folder appears with a 
Windows logo.
 
If you’re planning on rebooting with an external Universal Serial Bus (USB) 
or FireWire startup disk, that disk must be connected already, powered on, 
and recognized by the system before you display these settings.
Click Target Disk Mode to restart your Mac as a FireWire external hard drive 
connected to another computer. (This comes in especially handy when 
you’re upgrading to a new Mac and you need to move files between the two 
computers. I’ve also used it when the video card in one of my Macs decided 
to stop working. This allowed me to make an updated backup copy of the 
ailing Mac’s hard drive before I sent it off for repair.) You can also restart 
your Mac and hold down the T key to invoke Target Disk Mode.
After you click a disk to select it, click the Restart button. Mac OS X confirms 
your choice, and your Mac reboots.
Time Machine preferences
The Preferences pane shown in Figure 3-28 controls the automatic backups 
performed by Snow Leopard’s Time Machine feature.
To enable Time Machine, click the On toggle switch and then select a disk 
that will hold your Time Machine backup data on the sheet that appears; 
click Use for Backup to confirm your choice. If you have an external Time 
Capsule wireless unit, click Set Up Time Capsule.

By default, Time Machine backs up all the hard drives on your system; how-
ever, you may not need to back up some hard drives or folders on your Mac. 
To save time and hard drive space, Time Machine allows you to exclude 
specific drives and folders from the backup process. Click Options and then 
click the Add button (with the plus sign) to select the drives or folders you 
want to exclude, and they’ll appear in the Do Not Back Up list.
 
To remove an exclusion, select it in the list and click the Delete button (with 
the minus sign). Note the Total Included figure increases, and Time Machine 
adds the item you deleted from the list to the next backup.
By default, Snow Leopard warns you when deleting older backup files, but 
you can turn this off from the Options sheet as well.
 
You can elect to back up your Mac immediately by clicking the Time 
Machine icon in the Finder menu bar and choosing Back Up Now.
Universal Access preferences
The final group, Universal Access, is shown in Figure 3-29. These settings 
modify the display and sound functions within Mac OS X to make them more 
friendly to physically challenged users. Note that if you select the VoiceOver 
On radio button, Mac OS X speaks the text for all text and buttons on-screen.
If you have an assistive device that’s recognized by Mac OS X, select 
the Enable Access for Assistive Devices check box to allow it to be used 
throughout the operating system. You can also elect to display the Universal 
Access status icon in the Finder menu bar.

The four tabs here are
 
✦ Seeing: These settings make it easier for those with limited vision to 
use Mac OS X. You can toggle VoiceOver on and off from here; I discuss 
more on this feature and these settings in Book VIII, Chapter 3. To turn 
on the display Zoom feature, select the Zoom On radio button or press 
Ô+Option+8.
 
 To specify how much magnification is used, click the Options button. 
From the sheet that appears, you can set the minimum and maximum 
Zoom magnification increments. From the keyboard, use Ô+Option+= 
(equal sign) to zoom in and Ô+Option+– (minus sign) to zoom out. 
Optionally, you can display a preview rectangle of the area that’s 
included when you zoom. Mac OS X can smooth images to make them 
look better when zoomed; click the Options button in the Zoom section 
of the pane and select the Smooth Images check box.
 
 You can also determine how the screen moves in relation to the mouse 
pointer from the Zoom Options sheet: By default, the zoomed screen 
moves with the pointer, but you can set it to move only when the 
pointer reaches the edge of the screen or maintain the pointer near the 
center of the zoomed image automatically. If your mouse has a scroll 
wheel or ball, you can specify a modifier key to activate the Zoom feature.
 
 If you prefer white text on a black background, select the White on Black 
radio button (or press the Ô+Option+Control+8 keyboard shortcut). 
Note that depending on your display settings, it might be easier on the 
eyes to use grayscale display mode by selecting the Use Grayscale check 
box. Drag the Enhance Contrast slider to increase the contrast between 
text and background.

Tweaking the System
 
✦ Hearing: If you need additional visual cues to supplement the spoken 
and audio alerts in Mac OS X, click this tab and select the Flash the 
Screen When an Alert Sound Occurs check box. Two-channel stereo 
audio can be reduced to single-channel mono audio with the Play Stereo 
Audio as Mono check box. To raise the overall sound volume in Mac OS 
X, you can click the Adjust Volume button to display the Sound System 
Preferences settings, where you can drag the Volume slider to the right.
 
✦ Keyboard: These settings help those who have trouble pressing key-
board shortcuts or those who often trigger keyboard repeats (repetition 
of the same character) accidentally. If you mark the Sticky Keys On radio 
button, you can use modifier keys individually that are grouped together 
automatically as a single keyboard shortcut — in other words, you can 
press the modifier keys in a key sequence one after another instead of 
all together. Sticky Keys can be toggled on and off from the keyboard by 
pressing the Shift key five times. (You can optionally specify that Mac 
OS X sound a beep tone when a modifier key is pressed and whether the 
modifier keys are displayed on-screen.)
 
 Turn Slow Keys on to add a pause (of the length that you specify) 
between when a key is pressed and when it’s actually acted upon within 
Mac OS X. You can optionally add a key-click sound each time you press 
a key. To turn keyboard repeat off entirely, click the Set Key Repeat 
button, which opens the Keyboard preference settings that I discuss 
earlier.
 
✦ Mouse & Trackpad: With Mouse Keys active, you can use the numeric 
keypad to move the mouse pointer across your screen. Mouse Keys can 
be toggled on and off by pressing the Option key five times. Drag the 
Initial Delay and Maximum Speed sliders to specify how long you must 
hold down a keypad key before the pointer starts to move as well as 
how fast the pointer should move across the screen. You can also 
disable the trackpad on a Mac laptop when using Mouse Keys.
 
 If you prefer a larger pointer, the cursor can be resized to make it easier 
to spot on-screen. You can also click the Open Keyboard Preferences 
button to turn on Full Keyboard Access or to remap keyboard shortcuts 
for both the Finder and many applications.

Can Use My Mac, Too?
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding how multiuser systems work

✓ Changing the appearance of the login screen
✓ Tightening security during login
✓ Starting applications automatically when you log in
W
hether you’re setting up Mac OS X for use in a public library or 
simply allowing your 12-year-old to use your Mac in your home 
office, configuring Snow Leopard for multiple users is a simple task. However, 
you must also consider the possible downsides of a mismanaged multiuser 
system: files and folders being shared that you didn’t want in the public 
domain, users logging in as one another, and the very real possibility of 
accidental file deletion (and worse).
Therefore, in this chapter, I show you how to take those first steps before 
you open Pandora’s Box — setting login options, configuring the personal 
account that you created when you first installed the operating system, and 
protecting your stuff. (Network administrators call this security check-up 
locking things down. Better start using the terminology now, even before you 
buy your suspenders and pocket protector.)
How Multiuser Works on Mac OS X
When you create multiple users in Mac OS X, each person who uses your 
Macintosh — hence the term user — has a separate account (much like an 
account that you might open at a bank). Mac OS X creates a Home folder 
for each user and saves that user’s preferences independently from those 
of other users. When you log in to Mac OS X, you provide a username and 
a password, which identify you. The username/password combination tells 
Mac OS X which user has logged in — and, therefore, which preferences and 
Home folder to use.

How Multiuser Works on Mac OS X
220
Each account also carries a specific level, which determines how much control 
the user has over Mac OS X and the computer itself. Without an account 
with the proper access level, for example, a user might not be able to display 
many of the panes in System Preferences.
The three most common account levels are
 
✦ Root: Also called System Administrator, this uber-account can change 
anything within Mac OS X — and that’s usually A Very Bad Thing, so it’s 
actually disabled as a default. (This alone should tell you that the Root 
account shouldn’t be toyed with.) For instance, the Root account can 
seriously screw up the UNIX subsystem within Mac OS X, or a Root user 
can delete files within the Mac OS X System Folder.
 
 Enable the System Administrator account and use it only if told to do 
so by an Apple technical support technician.
 
✦ Administrator: (Or admin for short.) This is the account level that 
you’re assigned when you install Mac OS X. The administrator account 
should not be confused with the System Administrator account!
 
 It’s perfectly okay for you or anyone you assign to use an administrator 
account. An administrator can install applications anywhere on the 
system, create/edit/delete user accounts, and make changes to all the 
settings in System Preferences. However, an administrator can’t move or 
delete items from any other user’s Home folder, and administrators are 
barred from modifying or deleting files in the Mac OS X System Folder.
 
 A typical multiuser Mac OS X computer has only one administrator — 
like a teacher in a classroom — but technically, you can create as many 
administrator accounts as you like. If you do need to give someone else 
this access level, assign it only to a competent, experienced user whom 
you trust.
 
✦ Standard: A standard user account is the default in Mac OS X. Standard 
users can install software and save documents only in their Home fold-
ers and the Shared folder (which resides in the Users folder), and they 
can change only certain settings in System Preferences. Thus, they can 
do little damage to the system as a whole. For example, each of the stu-
dents in a classroom should be given a standard-level account for the 
Mac OS X system that they share.
 
 If Parental Controls are applied to a standard account, it becomes a man-
aged account, allowing you to fine-tune what a standard account user 
can do. (I discuss Parental Controls at length in Book II, Chapter 5.)
Chapter 5 of this minibook covers the entire process of creating and editing 
a user account.

Configuring Your Login Screen

Configuring Your Login Screen
Take a look at the changes you can make to the login process. First, Mac OS X 
provides two methods of displaying the login screen, as well as one auto-
matic method that doesn’t display the login screen at all:
 
✦ Logging in with a list: To log in, click your account username in the list, 
and the login screen displays the password prompt. Type your pass-
word — Mac OS X displays bullet characters to ensure security — and 
press Return (or click the Log In button).
 
✦ Logging in with username and password: Type your account username 
in the Name field and press Tab. Then type your password and press 
Return (or click the Log In button).
 
✦ Automatic Login: With Automatic Login set, Mac OS X automatically 
logs in the specified account when you reboot. In effect, you never 
see the login screen unless you click Log Out from the Apple menu. 
(Naturally, this is an attractive option to use if your computer is in a 
secure location — such as your office — and you’ll be the only one using 
your Mac.)
To specify which type of login screen you see — if you see one at all — head to 
System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click the Login Options button.
The Guest account is a convenient method of 
granting someone temporary access to your 
Mac — in fact, your guest doesn’t even need 
a password to log in! Your Guest account has 
all the attributes of a standard account, so the 
visitor has little chance of accidentally (or pur-
posefully) damaging your system. However, 
after the guest user logs out, the Guest account 
is “flushed” and all the data and files that 
person created using the account are deleted 
automatically. (This allows the next guest to 
start with a clean slate.)
By default, the Guest account is disabled. To 
turn on this feature, open System Preferences, 
click Accounts, and then click the Guest 
Account entry in the list. (You may have to 
click the Lock icon in the lower-left corner of 
the Accounts pane and provide your admin 
password before you can continue.) Click the 
Allow Guests to Log In to This Computer check 
box to enable it.
Oh, and don’t forget that you can enable spe-
cific Parental Controls for the Guest account, 
just as you can for any other account. That 
should come in handy if your daughter has a 
slumber party coming up this weekend. . . . .
Working with the Guest account

Configuring Your Login Screen
222
 
✦ To set Automatic Login, display the Login Options settings and click 
the Automatic Login pop-up menu. Choose the account that automati-
cally logs in from the list. When Mac OS X displays the user Name and 
Password sheet that you see in Figure 4-1, type the corresponding 
password and then click OK.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Configuring 
Automatic 
Login 
from the 
Accounts 
panel.
 
 
 Never set the Automatic Login feature to an admin-level account unless 
you’re sure to be the only one using your Mac. If the computer is 
rebooted, you’re opening the door for anyone to simply sashay in and 
wreak havoc!
 
✦ To determine whether Mac OS X uses a list login screen, you must 
again visit the Login Options settings pane (see Figure 4-2). Select the 
List of Users radio button for a list login screen or select the Name and 
Password radio button for a simple login screen where you must type 
your username and password.
 
To change settings specific to your account — no matter what your access 
level — log in with your account, open System Preferences, and click Accounts. 
From here, you can change your account password and picture, the card 
marked as yours within the Address Book, and the Login Items launched 
automatically when you log in. (Peruse more information on the Address 
Book in Book I, Chapter 6.)
To log out of Mac OS X without restarting or shutting down the computer, 
choose the Apple menu and then choose Log Out or just press Ô+Shift+Q. 
You see the confirmation dialog, as shown in Figure 4-3. Although Mac OS X 
will display the login screen after two minutes, someone can still saunter up

and click the Cancel button, thereby gaining access to your stuff. Therefore, 
make it a practice to always click the Log Out button on this screen before 
your hand leaves the mouse, or bypass the confirmation dialog altogether by 
holding down the Option key as you click Log Out from the menu!
 
Figure 4-2: 
Will that be 
a simple or 
a list login

You can also enable Fast User Switching from the Login Options panel. This 
feature allows another user to sit down and log in while the previous user’s 
applications are still running in the background. When you enable switching, 
Snow Leopard displays the currently active user’s name or account icon at 
the right side of the Finder menu bar. Click the name, and a menu appears; 
click Login Window, and another user can then log in as usual. (From the 
Login Options pane, you can also choose to display the current user by the 
account’s short name or the account icon.)
Even though you’re playing musical chairs, the Big X remembers what’s run-
ning and the state of your Desktop when you last left it. (When you decide to 
switch back, Snow Leopard prompts you for that account’s login password 
for security. . . just in case, you understand.)

Locking Things Down
224
Locking Things Down
If security is a potential problem and you still need to share a Mac between 
multiple users, lock things down. To protect Mac OS X from unauthorized 
use, take care of these potential security holes immediately:
 
✦ Disable the Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down buttons. Any computer can 
be hacked when it’s restarted or turned on, so disable the Restart and 
Shut Down buttons on the login screen. (After a user has successfully 
logged in, Mac OS X can be shut down normally by using the menu item 
or the keyboard shortcuts that I cover earlier.) Open the Accounts pane 
in System Preferences, click the Login Options button, and deselect the 
Show the Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down Buttons check box. Press Ô+Q 
to quit and save your changes. (You can find more about restarting and 
shutting down in Book I, Chapter 2.)
 
✦ Disable list logins. With a list login, any potential hacker already knows 
half the information necessary to gain entry to your system — and often 
the password is easy to guess. Therefore, set Mac OS X to ask for the 
username and password on the Login screen, as I describe earlier. This 
way, someone has to guess both the username and the password, which 
is a much harder proposition.
 
✦ Disable Automatic Login. A true no-brainer. As I mention earlier in the 
chapter, Automatic Login is indeed very convenient. However, all some-
one has to do is reboot your Mac, and the machine automatically logs in 
one lucky user! To disable Automatic Login, display the Accounts panel 
in System Preferences and click the Login Options button; then click the 
Automatic Login pop-up menu and click the Off entry.
 
✦ Disable the password hint. By default, Mac OS X obligingly displays the 
password hint for an account after three unsuccessful attempts at enter-
ing a password. Where security is an issue, this is like serving a hacker 
a piece of apple pie. Therefore, head to System Preferences, display the 
Accounts settings, click the Login Options button, and make sure that 
the Show Password Hints check box is empty.
 
✦ Select passwords intelligently. Although using your mother’s maiden 
name for a password might seem like a great idea, the best method of 
selecting a password is to use a completely random group of mixed let-
ters and numbers. If you find a random password too hard to remember, 
at least add a number after your password, like dietcoke1 — and no, that 
isn’t one of my passwords. (Nice try.) My editor suggests a favorite loca-
tion spelled backwards, with a number mixed in — easier to remember 
than a completely random sequence of characters!
 
 For even greater security, make at least one password character upper-
case, and use a number at the beginning and ending of the password. Or, 
do the “c001” thing and replace characters with numbers, like the zero 
that you insert in dietc0ke.

Here’s one other advantage to logins: Each account can have its own selec-
tion of applications that run automatically when that user logs in. These 
applications are Login Items, and they appear as a list in the Accounts pane 
(shown in Figure 4-4). A caveat or two:
 
✦ The users setting their Login Items must be logged in. Only the user 
can modify his or her own Login Items.
 
✦ Users must have access to System Preferences. If the person is using a 
standard-level account, it must allow access to System Preferences.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Preparing 
to launch

Book every 
time I log in.
 
Including an application in your Login Items list is easy: Click the button 
with the plus sign to navigate to the desired application, select it, and then 
click Add. (Alternatively, you can just drag items from a Finder window and 
drop them directly into the list.) Note that items in the list are launched in 
order. If something needs to run before something else, you can drag the 
item entries into any sequence.
To launch the application in hidden mode — which might or might not dis-
play it in the Dock, depending on the application itself — click the list entry 
for the desired item and enable its Hide check box.

I
n Chapter 4 of this minibook, I introduce you to the different Mac OS X 
multiuser account levels and the login process. If you’re ready to share 
your Mac with others, you discover how to add new accounts and edit 
existing accounts in this chapter. Oh, and yes, I also show you how to frag — 
that’s multiplayer game-speak for delete — accounts that you no longer 
need. I also demonstrate how to add optional limitations to an individual 
user account and how to avoid using a keychain (which is supposed to make 
it easier to store that pocketful of passwords that you’ve created on the 
Internet).
Yes, you read correctly. By all that’s good and righteous, Mac OS X actually 
has a feature that I don’t want you to use. Read on to find out more.
Adding, Editing, and Deleting Users
All multiuser account chores take place in a single System Preferences pane. 
(Cue James Bond theme song.) The Accounts pane is the star of this chapter, 
so open System Preferences and click the Accounts icon.
If you haven’t added any users to your system yet, the Users list should look 
like Figure 5-1. You should see your account, which you set up when you 
installed Mac OS X, set to administrator (admin) level.
 
You also have an entry for a Guest account, which anyone can use on an 
as-needed basis. To enable the Guest account, click the Guest entry in the 
list and click the Allow Guests to Log In to This Computer check box to 
select it. Note that any files created or settings changed by the Guest user 
are automatically deleted when the Guest user logs out (or you restart or 
reboot your Mac).

228

Adding a new user account
To add a new user account, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Accounts pane in System Preferences, click the New User 
button — which carries a plus sign — to display an empty user record 
sheet that you see in Figure 5-2.
 
Figure 5-2:

 If the New User button is disabled and you can’t click it, click the lock at 
the bottom left of the System Preferences pane and provide your pass-
word to unlock the Accounts pane.

2. Select the access level for this user from the New Account pop-up menu.
 
 By default, the user receives a standard level account. You can also 
choose an Administrator account, or a Managed standard account with 
Parental Controls already enabled.
 
3. In the Name text box, type the name that you want to display for this 
account (both in the Accounts list and on the Login screen) and then 
press Tab to move to the next field.
 
 Mac OS X automatically generates a short name for use as your screen 
and Buddy name in iChat and various network applications. The 
short name is also the name of the folder that Mac OS X creates on 
the computer’s hard drive for this user. You can keep the default short 
name or type a new one, but it must not contain any spaces. For more 
on iChat, jump to Book V, Chapter 3. (I’ll wait for you here.)
 
4. Press Tab again.
 
5. In the Password text box, type the password for the new account.
 
 Click the button with the key icon next to the Password field, and 
Snow Leopard is happy to display the Password Assistant, complete 
with a suggestion. Click the Suggestion pop-up menu to see additional 
suggestions. You can choose the length of the password and select 
among several types: letters and numbers, numbers only, memorable, 
completely random, or even government-quality. The Assistant 
automatically copies the current password you’re considering to the 
Password text box.
 
 As always, when you enter a password or its verification, Mac OS X 
displays bullet characters for security.
 
6. Press Tab, type the password in the Verify text box, and press Tab again.
 
7. (Optional) If you decide to use the password hint feature that I 
describe in Book II, Chapter 4, you can enter a short sentence or 
question in the Password Hint text box.
 
 The hint is displayed after three unsuccessful attempts at entering the 
account password.
 
 I recommend that you do not use this option. Think about it: Any hack 
could type in anything three times to get your hint to pop up! If you do 
use this option, at least make sure that the hint is sufficiently vague!
 
 Press Tab to continue.
 
8. To automatically turn on the FileVault encryption feature for this new 
account, select the Turn On FileVault protection check box.
 
 For more information on FileVault, see the sidebar later in this chapter 
entitled “So you like your privacy . . .”
 
9. Click the Create Account button to finish and create the account.
 
 The new account shows up in the Accounts list and in the Login screen.

230
Adding, Editing, and Deleting Users
Editing an existing account
If you have administrator access, it’s a cinch to make changes to an existing 
account from the Accounts pane in System Preferences. (Often, this is to 
assign a personalized account picture, so I demonstrate that here.) Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the account that you want to change in the Accounts list.
 
 Don’t forget, if the accounts in the list are disabled and you can’t select 
one, you must unlock the Accounts pane. Click the lock at the bottom 
left of the System Preferences pane and type your password.
 
2. Edit the settings that you need to change.
 
3. Click the square Picture well to specify the thumbnail image that 
appears in the Login list next to the account name.
 
 Apple provides a number of good images in the preview collection — 
just click a thumbnail to select it.
 
4. To add your own picture, click Edit Picture. You can drag a new image 
from the Finder into the icon placeholder or click Choose to select 
one from an Open File dialog; then click Set.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Take a Video Snapshot button to grab a 
picture from your iSight or other video camera connected to your Mac. 
Most cool.
 
5. After you make the changes (and you select just the right image to 
capture the user’s personality — a more difficult task than you might 
think), press Ô+Q to save them and close the System Preferences pane.
Deleting an existing account
To wipe an account from the face of the Earth, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the account that you want to delete in the Accounts list.
 
2. Click the Delete User button (which is smartly marked with a minus sign).
 
 Mac OS X displays the confirmation sheet that you see in Figure 5-3.
 
 Note that the contents of the user’s Home folder can be saved in a disk 
image in the Deleted Users folder (just in case you need to retrieve 
something). Alternatively, you can choose to leave the deleted user’s 
home folder as is, without removing it.
 
 If you’re absolutely sure you won’t be dating that person again, click 
the Delete the Home Folder option (which doesn’t save anything in the 
Deleted Users folder). You regain all the hard drive space that was being 
occupied by the contents of the deleted user’s home folder.
 
3. Click OK to verify and delete the account. Click the Cancel button to 
abort and return to the Accounts list.

These days, everyone’s interested in 
securing his or her personal files from prying 
eyes. Granted, this isn’t a problem if you’re the 
only one using your Mac. However, if you’re 
sharing a computer in a multiuser environment, 
you might want a little more protection than 
just user permissions for those all-important 
Fantasy Football formations that you’ll unleash 
next season.
Never fear, Snow Leopard offers a feature 
called FileVault, which provides Home folder 
encryption that prevents just about anyone 
except the NSA or FBI from gaining access to 
the files in your Home folder. (You’ll notice that 
things slow down just a bit when logging in and 
out or working with files that are several giga-
bytes in size, but for those of us who need the 
peace of mind, this minimal performance hit is 
worth it.) You can enable the FileVault feature 
from the Security pane in System Preferences. 
Two passwords control access to your Home 
folder when FileVault is active:
 ✓ The Master Password can unlock any 
Home folder for any user. Only someone 
with an admin account can set the Master 
Password. The Master Password must be 
set before you can turn on the FileVault 
feature for any account on your system.
 ✓ Your Login Password unlocks your Home 
folder.
Personally, I love this feature, and I use it on 
all my Macs running Snow Leopard. Yet a risk 
is involved (insert ominous chord here). To wit: 
DO NOT forget your Login Password and make 
doggone sure that your Admin user remembers 
that all-important Master Password! Mac OS 
X displays a dire warning for anyone who’s 
considering using FileVault: If you forget these 
passwords, you can’t retrieve any data from 
your Home folder. Period. As Jerry Reed says, 
“It’s a gone pecan.”
So you like your privacy . . .

Tightening Your Security Belt
Tightening Your Security Belt
Administrators are special people. Just ask one; you’ll see. Anyway, when an 
administrator creates or edits the account for a standard-level user, Mac OS 
X offers a number of levels of specific rights — Parental Controls — that can 
be assigned on an individual account basis. When an account has Parental 
Controls assigned, it becomes a managed account.
Parental Controls are available only for standard-level users; administrators 
aren’t affected by them because an administrator-level account already has 
access to everything covered by controls.
When do you need Parental Controls? Here are three likely scenarios:
 
✦ You’re creating accounts for corporate or educational users, and you 
want to disable certain features of Mac OS X to prevent those folks from 
doing something dumb. Just tell ’em you’re streamlining the operating 
system. (Yeah, that’s it.) For example, you might not want that one 
particular kid making CD copies of The Illustrated Anarchist’s Cookbook 
in the classroom while you’re gone. Therefore, you disable the ability for 
that account to burn CDs or DVDs.
 
✦ In the same environment, you might want to give a specific standard-
level account the ability to administer printers. If Roger in Accounting 
is both helpful and knowledgeable — oh, and add trustworthy in there, 
too — you might want to give him this capability so that he can handle 
the print queues while you’re on vacation.
 
✦ You want one or more users to access one — and only one — application 
on the system, or perhaps just two or three applications. To illustrate: In 
my years as a hospital hardware technician, we had a number of 
computers that were used solely to display patient records. No Word, no 
e-mail, nothing but the one program that accessed the medical records 
database. We called these machines dumb terminals although they were 
actually personal computers. (This trick also works well if you’re a 
parent and you want to give your kids access without endangering your 
valuable files. Just don’t call your computer a dumb terminal lest your 
kids take offense. That’s experience talking there.) If you want to allow 
access to a specified selection of applications, you can set them in that 
account’s controls.
Setting Parental Controls
Time to review what each of the settings does. To display the controls for 
a standard account, click the account in the list and then click the Open 
Parental Controls button. Click the Enable Parental Controls button, and 
click the Lock icon in the lower-left corner to confirm your access (if necessary). 
Snow Leopard includes five different categories of controls, as shown in 
Figure 5-4:

Figure 5-4: 
You can 
restrict 
access 
to many 
functions 
within a 
Standard 
account.
 
 
✦ System: These settings (which I discuss in more detail in a second) 
affect what the user can do within Snow Leopard as well as what the 
Finder itself looks like to that user.
 
✦ Content: These settings control the Dictionary and Safari applications. 
If you prefer that profane terms be hidden within the Dictionary for this 
user, click the Hide Profanity in Dictionary check box to enable it. Snow 
Leopard also offers three levels of control for Web sites:
 
• Allow Unrestricted Access: Select this radio button to allow unfettered 
access for this user.
 
• Try to Limit Access: You can allow Safari to automatically block Web 
sites it deems adult. To specify particular sites that the automatic 
adult figure should allow or deny, click the Customize button.
 
• Allow Access to Only These Websites: Choose this radio button to 
specify which Web sites the user can view. To add a Web site, click 
the Add button (which bears a plus sign) — Snow Leopard prompts 
you for a title and the Web site address.
 
✦ Mail and iChat: Click the Limit Mail and Limit iChat check boxes to 
specify the e-mail and instant messaging addresses that this user can 
communicate with. (Note that this affects only Apple Mail and iChat, so 
other mail clients, Web-based mail, and instant messaging applications 
aren’t controlled.) To add an address that the user can e-mail or chat 
with, click the Add button.

234

 Do you want a notification if the user is attempting to send an e-mail to 
someone not in the list? Click the Send Permission Requests To check 
box to select it and then type your e-mail address in the text box.
 
✦ Time Limits: Parents, click the Time Limits button, and you’ll shout 
with pure joy — check out the options on this pane in Figure 5-5! You 
can limit an account to a certain number of hours of usage per weekday 
(Weekday Time Limits), limit to a specified number of hours of usage 
per weekend day (Weekend Time Limits), and set a bedtime computer 
curfew time for both weekdays and weekend days.
 
Figure 5-5:

Leopard 
keeps track 
of your kid’s 
computer 
usage so 
that you 
don’t 
have to.
 
 
✦ Logs: Snow Leopard keeps a number of different types of text log files 
(which track where the user goes on the Internet, which applications are 
launched by the account, and the contents of any iChat conversations 
where the user was a participant). From this central pane, you can moni-
tor all the logs for a particular account. Note that these logs are enabled 
or disabled from other locations within Snow Leopard: For example, 
the log showing the Web sites visited and blocked is enabled from the 
Content pane that I describe a little earlier, whereas the applications log 
is enabled when on the System pane. iChat logging is turned on from the 
Preferences dialog within the iChat application.
 
You can always tell whether an account has been assigned Parental Controls 
because the account description changes from Standard to Managed in the 
Accounts list.

Multiuser Accounts
235
Tightening Your Security Belt
Of particular importance are the System controls. Click the System tab to 
modify these settings:
 
✦ Use Simple Finder: I discuss the Simple Finder in the following section 
because it’s a great idea for families and classrooms with smaller children.
 
✦ Only Allow Selected Applications: When this option is selected, you 
can select the specific applications that appear to the user. These 
restrictions are in effect whether the user has access to the Full Finder 
or just the Simple Finder.
 
 To allow access to all the applications of a specific type — iLife, iWork, 
Internet, Widgets, Other, and Utilities — click the check box next to the 
desired group heading to select it. To restrict access to all applications 
within a group, click the check box next to the heading to deselect it. 
You can also toggle the restriction on and off for specific applications 
in these groups; click the triangle icon next to each group heading to 
expand the list and then either mark or clear the check box next to the 
desired applications. To locate a specific application, click in the Search 
box and type the application name.
 
 To add a new application to the Allow list, drag its icon from the Finder 
and drop it in the list within the Other group. After you add an applica-
tion, it appears in the Other group, and you can toggle access to it on 
and off like the applications in the named groups.
 
✦ Can Administer Printers: With this check box selected, the user can 
modify the printers and printer queues within the Print & Fax pane in 
System Preferences. If this option is disabled, the user can still print to 
the default printer and switch to other assigned printers but can’t add 
or delete printers or manage the Mac OS X print queue.
 
✦ Can Burn CDs and DVDs: Deselect this check box to prevent the user 
from recording CDs or DVDs via the built-in disc recording features in 
Mac OS X. (Note, however, that if you load a third-party recording 
program, such as Toast, the user can still record discs with it.)
 
✦ Can Change Password: Select this check box to allow the user to change 
the account password.
 
 If you’re creating a single standard-level account for an entire group of 
people to use — for example, if you want to leave the machine in kiosk 
mode in one corner of the office or if everyone in a classroom will use 
the same account on the machine — I recommend disabling the ability 
to change the account password. (Oh, and please do me a favor . . . don’t 
create a system with just one admin-level account that everyone is 
supposed to use! Instead, keep your one admin-level account close to your 
bosom and create a standard-level account for the Unwashed Horde.)
 
✦ Can Modify the Dock: Select this check box, and the user can remove 
applications, documents, and folders from the Dock in the Full Finder. 
(If you don’t want the contents of the Dock changing according to the 
whims of other users, it’s a good idea to deselect this check box.)

236
Tightening Your Security Belt
Assigning the Simple Finder
You can restrict your standard-level users even further by assigning them 
the Simple Finder set of limitations. The default Simple Finder, as shown in 
Figure 5-6, is a highly simplified version of the regular Mac OS X Finder. The 
simplified Dock contains only the following: the Finder icon; the Trash; and 
the folders for the user’s approved applications, documents, and shared 
files.
 
Figure 5-6: 
Whoa! It’s 
the Simple 
Finder — 
less filling; 
still runs 
great!
 
This is the network administrator’s idea of a foolproof interface for Mac OS 
X: A user can access only those system files and resources needed to do a 
job, with no room for tinkering or goofing off.
 
A Simple Finder user can still make the jump to the full version of the Finder 
by clicking Finder and choosing Run Full Finder. The user has to enter a 
correct admin-level username and password.
 
You can also change the Auto Login account from the Accounts pane. Click 
the Login Options button under the Accounts list and then click the

Automatic Login is not a good security feature in many cases (as with a

laptop on the road), it can be a good feature for those preparing a Mac for 
public use — if you set the Automatic Login to your public standard-access 
account, Mac OS X automatically uses the right account if the Mac is 
rebooted or restarted.
Don’t forget, you can always choose Log Out from the Apple menu to log in 
under your own account.
Using Keychains — NOT
Before I leave this chapter, I want to discuss a Mac OS X feature that’s been 
around since the days of Mac OS 9: the keychain. Your account keychain 
stores all the username/password combinations for Web sites, file servers, 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers, and the like, allowing you to simply 
waltz in and start using the service (whatever it is). Sounds handy, doesn’t 
it? And it can be, but you better watch your step.
I’m perfectly honest here: I hate account keychains. With a passion, mind 
you. As a consultant, Webmaster, and the SYSOP (an ancient Bulletin 
Board Service acronym meaning System Operator) of an Internet-based 
online system, I know what a hassle it is for users to remember separate 
passwords, and I feel that pain. (I use separate passwords for everything.) 
However, three massively big problems are inherent with using keychains:
 
✦ Anyone can log on as you. If your keychain is unlocked, which happens 
automatically when you log in, all someone has to do is sit at your desk, 
visit a site or connect with a server, and bam! They’re on. As you. Think 
about that. And then think how many times you get up from your desk, 
just for a second, to grab another Diet Coke or a doughnut.
 
✦ You’ll forget your passwords. If the keychain file is corrupted — and it 
can happen — your passwords have gone to Detroit without you. Either 
you’ve got them on paper hidden somewhere, they’re on your recent 
backup, or it’s time to change your online persona.
 
✦ Keychains need yet another stinkin’ password. Yep, that’s right — your 
keychain can be locked (either manually or, with the right settings, 
automatically), and you have to remember yet another password/pass-
phrase to unlock your keychain. “When, oh when will the madness end?”
 
From a security standpoint, keychains should be completely off-limits for 
anyone who’s interested in maintaining a well-locked-down machine. After 
all, most folks can completely take care of all their Internet and network 
connections with a handful of passwords, and that’s no big deal for anyone 
to remember. Unfortunately, Snow Leopard creates a keychain automatically 
for every user, so you have to monitor (and delete) your keychain data 
manually. (Sigh.)

238
Using Keychains — NOT
However, if you’re the only person using your Mac and it resides in your 
home — personally, I’d prefer a bank vault — and you absolutely must 
use keychains, you can display them all for the current account from the 
Keychain Access application (see Figure 5-7), conveniently located in 
Utilities within your Applications folder. Click the Category tab and then 
click an item in the keychain list to display or edit all its information.
 
Figure 5-7: 
Take my 
advice — 
stay away 
from the 
allure of the 
keychain.
 
 
Heck, just think about what I just wrote — anyone can display and edit 
server and site information just by launching this application! That includes 
your nephew Damien — you know, the one who considers himself the 
hacker extraordinaire. (While I’m at it, I should mention that it’s just as bad 
to set the Automatic Login feature — which I discuss earlier in this chapter — 
to an admin-level account. One reboot, and you’re rolling out the red carpet 
for the little rascal. For the inside information on Automatic Login, visit 
Chapter 4 in this very minibook.)
To help lock things down — at least when it comes to your Internet 
communications — follow this path:
 
1. To display your Internet passwords, click the Passwords category 
(upper-left).
 
2. Click each Internet password to select it in the list and then click 
the lowercase i button at the bottom of the window to display the 
information on that password.
 
3. Click the Access Control tab to display the settings that you see in 
Figure 5-8, one of which I strongly recommend.

 To minimize the damage that someone can do with this password, you 
can select the Confirm before Allowing Access radio button. And for yet 
another level of security, select the Ask for Keychain Password check box.
 
 Of course, you’re probably thinking, “Well, Mark, that pretty much 
eliminates the purpose of quick, convenient access without passwords, 
doesn’t it?” Yes, indeed it does, but at least your online identity is 
somewhat safeguarded.
 
 Click the plus sign button at the bottom of the Keychain Access window 
to add a new password. Type a name for the item, the username that 
you typically type to gain access, and the password for that server or 
site. Then click Add and cross your fingers.
To display all the keychains you can access, choose Edit➪Keychain List. To 
create a brand-new keychain, choose File➪New Keychain. Mac OS X prompts 
you for the filename for your new keychain file. In the New Keychain dialog that 
appears, enter a catchy name in the Save As text box. By default, the keychain 
file is created in the Keychains folder — a good idea — but if you want to store 
it elsewhere, click the down-arrow button next to the Where list box and 
navigate to the desired folder. When you’re ready, click the Create button. Now 
you need to enter yet another password, type it again to verify it, and click OK.
To lock or unlock your login keychain, click the Lock icon at the top-left of 
the Keychain Access window. (Unlocking your keychain requires you to 
enter your login password. Go figure.)
You might be saying to yourself, “Geez, this guy is more than a little 
paranoid.” And yes, dear reader, I suppose I am. But then again, who’s been 
uploading all those questionable images and MP3 files to the company 
server . . . using your account?

Book II: Customizing and Sharing

Chapter 6: Sharing Documents 
for Fun and Profit
In This Chapter
✓ Comparing network sharing with multiuser sharing
✓ Setting and changing permissions
✓ Sharing documents in Microsoft Office 2008 for the Mac
N
ow here’s a topic that any Mac OS X power user can sink fangs into 
— the idea that a document on a multiuser system can be everyone’s 
property, allowing anyone in your family, workgroup, or highly competitive 
mob to make whatever changes are necessary, whenever they like.
Of course, potential pitfalls lurk — even in the Apple world, there’s no such 
thing as an operating system that’s both powerful and perfectly simple. 
However, I think you’ll find that our dear friends from Cupertino have done 
just about as well as can be expected and that the settings that you use to 
share documents are fairly easy to understand and use.
Prepare to share!
Sharing over a Network versus 
Sharing on a Single Mac
First, allow me to clear up what I’ve found to be a common misconception 
by using another of Mark’s Maxims.
 
Sharing documents on a single computer is fundamentally different from 
the file sharing that you’ve used on a network.
True, multiple users can share a document over a network, which is a topic 
that I cover in Book VI. But although the results are the same, the way that 
you share that same document on a single machine betwixt multiple users is 
a completely different turn of the screw. In this section, I discuss the 
factoids behind the matter.

242
Sharing over a Network versus Sharing on a Single Mac
No network is required
Although reiterating that no network is required is seemingly the most 
obvious of statements, many otherwise knowledgeable Mac OS X power 
users seem to forget that sharing a document over a network requires an 
active network connection. (Note the word active there.) Unless you physically 
copy the document to your hard drive — which defeats the purpose of 
document sharing — any loss of network connectivity or any problem with 
your network account will result in a brick wall and a brightly painted sign 
reading, “No luck, Jack.” (Or perhaps it’s flashing neon.)
On the other hand, a document shared on a multiuser Mac in the home or 
classroom is available whenever you need it. As long as the file is located 
in the Shared folder, the file privileges are set correctly, and you know the 
password (if one is required by the application, such as a password-protected 
Word document), then — as they say on “Star Trek” — “You have the conn” 
whether your network connection is active or not.
Relying on a guaranteed lock
Sharing documents over a network can get a tad hairy when multiple users 
open and edit the document simultaneously. Applications, such as Office 
2008 for the Mac, have methods of locking the document (giving one person 
exclusive access) when someone opens it or saves it. However, you always 
face the possibility that what you’re seeing in a shared network document 
isn’t exactly what’s in the document at that moment.
A multiuser system doesn’t need such exquisite complexity. You’re the 
one sitting at the keyboard, and you have control: This is what network 
administrators call a guaranteed lock on that document file. Refreshing, 
isn’t it?
But wait! Mac OS X Snow Leopard includes a feature called Fast User 
Switching — I discuss it in Book I, Chapter 2 — that allows other users to 
remain logged in behind the scenes while another user is at the keyboard. 
Therefore, if you enable Fast User Switching, two users could have the same 
document open at the same time. To prevent this, you can simply turn off 
Fast User Switching from the Accounts panel in System Preferences. (Click 
Accounts, click Login Options, and clear the Enable Fast User Switching 
check box.)
 
It’s also possible for someone to use Snow Leopard’s Remote Login feature 
to login to their account across the Internet. You can disable this feature by 
opening the System Preferences window, clicking the Share icon, and dese-
lecting the Remote Login check box.

Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
Most places are off limits
Network users are often confident that they can blithely copy and move a 
document from one place to another with the greatest of ease, and that’s 
true. Most shared network documents created by an application — such as 
a project outline created in Word, for example — carry their own sharing 
information and document settings internally. Thus, you can move that 
same file to another folder on your hard drive, and the rest of the network 
team can still open it. (Um, if they have the network rights to access the new 
folder, of course.)
This isn’t the case when it comes to multiuser documents. As you can read 
in Chapters 4 and 5 of this minibook, Mac OS X places a rather tight fence 
around a standard-level user, allowing that person to access only the contents 
of certain folders. In this case, your document must be placed in the Shared 
folder for every standard-level user to be able to open it. If everyone using 
the document has administrator access, you can store the file in other spots 
on your system; as long as the permissions are set, you’re set. And speaking 
of permissions . . .
Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
Files are shared in Mac OS X according to a set of rules called permissions, 
the ownership of the file (typically the person who saved the document the 
first time), and an access level specified as a group. The combination of 
privileges, ownership, and group determines who can do what with the file.
When you (or the person with the administrator account on your Mac) 
created your user account, you were automatically granted ownership of 
your Home folder and everything that it contains as well as any files or 
folders that you store in the Shared folder or another user’s Public folder.
Four possible actions are allowed through permissions:
 
✦ Read Only: This action allows the user to open and read the file, which 
includes copying it to another location.
 
✦ Read & Write: This permission grants full access to the file, including 
opening, reading, editing, saving, and deleting. Read & Write permission 
also allows the user to copy or move the file to another location.
 
✦ Write Only (Drop Box): A neat permission setting that appears only 
with a folder — it allows access to copy an item to the folder, but not to 
read any files it contains. (Hence the informal name Drop Box, and the + 
[plus sign] icon added to the folder’s icon to identify it.) For example, a 
drop box is made to order for teachers: Students can submit homework 
by dragging their work to the teacher’s drop box.

244
Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
 
✦ No Access: This is just what it sounds like — the user can’t open the file, 
copy it, or move it.
 
No matter what permissions you’ve set, only the System Administrator (or 
root user) can copy items into another user’s Home folder. Take my word for 
it on this one: Simply consider that this can’t be done, and stay as far away 
from the Root/System Administrator account as possible. (Trust me on 
this.) Read all about the perils of enabling the System Administrator account 
in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
These permissions are set in the Info dialog for a file or folder (always 
accessible by pressing Ô+I). If you’re setting the permissions for a folder, 
you can also elect to apply those same settings to all the enclosed items 
within the folder.
To set permissions, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the item to select it, press Ô +I (or choose Finder➪File), and then 
choose the Get Info menu item.
 
 If you have a mouse or trackball with a right button, you can right-click 
the item and choose Get Info instead. Either way, Mac OS X displays the 
Info dialog.
 
2. Click the right-facing arrow next to the Sharing & Permissions head-
ing to expand it, as shown in Figure 6-1.

245
Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
 
 Because I selected a file instead of a folder, the Apply Enclosed Items 
button doesn’t appear at the bottom of the section. (Take my word for 
it: If you’re using the Get Info command on a folder, it’ll be there.)
 
3. To change your own permissions on the item, click the You Can 
pop-up menu and choose a new Ownership permissions level.
 
 This is likely set to Read & Write, and it’s a good idea to leave it alone. If 
you’re the file’s owner, you’re likely not a security risk.
 
 Perhaps I should be a little less tactful here: Never choose an access 
level for yourself other than Read & Write without being absolutely sure 
of what you’re doing, because you can potentially prevent yourself from 
accessing or deleting the file in the future! For example, if you simply 
want to lock an item to prevent changes being made, don’t set your 
Ownership permission to Read Only. (Instead, select the Locked check 
box in the General section of the Info dialog instead . . . you can easily 
clear the Locked check box later to make changes to the item.)
 
4. To change permissions for someone else or a group, click the Privilege 
value for that user or group and then choose the appropriate value 
from the pop-up list.
 
 Assigning permissions for an entire group is a good idea for limiting 
specific files and folders to only Administrator access. (Note, however, 
that Snow Leopard reserves the group name wheel for internal tasks, so 
never alter any permissions for the wheel group.)
 
5. If necessary, set the permission for the Others pop-up menu (other-
wise known as “I’m going to lump everyone else into this category”).
 
 If a user isn’t the owner of an item and doesn’t fit into any group that 
you’ve selected, this access permission setting for this file applies to 
that user.
 
 If you’re setting permissions for a folder, Snow Leopard can automatically 
change the permissions for all the items contained in the folder to the 
same settings. Click the Apply Enclosed button, and Mac OS X displays a 
confirmation dialog.
 
 Generally, it’s a good idea not to override the permissions for all the items 
in a folder, so click the Apply Enclosed button only when necessary.
 
6. After all the permissions are correct, click the Close button to save 
your changes and return to your friendly Finder.
If a specific user or group doesn’t appear already in the Privilege list, click 
the Add button (bearing the plus sign) and you can add a specific privilege 
level for that user or group. You can also delete a privilege level: Click the 
desired entry to select it and click the Delete button (which bears a minus 
sign).

246
Permission and Sharing Do’s and Don’ts
Permission and Sharing Do’s and Don’ts
After you get the basics of sharing files and assigning permissions under 
your belt, you need to master when to change permissions and why you 
should (and shouldn’t) modify them. Follow these common-sense guidelines 
when saving documents, assigning permissions, and choosing access levels:
 
✦ Do use your Shared folder. The Shared folder is the center of proper 
document sharing. I know there’s a strong urge to create a new document 
in your Home folder, but you’re just making more work for yourself 
because you’ll end up copying that document from your Home folder 
to the Shared folder. Instead of an extra step, store a document that’s 
intended to be shared in the Shared folder — where it belongs in the 
first place.
 
✦ Don’t assign permissions just to protect a file from deletion. 
Remember, if all you need to do is prevent anyone (including yourself) 
from deleting an item, you don’t need to go to all the trouble of changing 
permissions. Instead, just display the Info dialog for the item and select 
the Locked check box to enable it, which prevents the item from being 
deleted from the Trash until the Lock status is disabled.
 
✦ Do review the contents of a folder before changing permissions for 
enclosed items. That confirmation dialog doesn’t appear just for kicks. 
For example, if you set a highly sensitive, private document with 
permissions of No Access for everyone but yourself and then you apply 
less-restrictive permissions globally to the folder that contains the 
document, you’ve just removed the No Access permissions, and anyone 
can open your dirty laundry. (Ouch.) Therefore, make sure that you 
open the folder and double-check its contents first before applying 
global permissions to the items it contains.
 
✦ Don’t change permissions in the Applications or Utilities folders. If 
you have Administrator-level access, you can actually change the 
permissions for important applications such as Mail, Address Book, 
iTunes, and Safari, as well as their support files. This spells havoc for 
all users assigned to the standard-access level. Be polite and leave the 
permissions for these files alone.
 
✦ Definitely don’t change System ownership. Mac OS X is stable and 
reliable. Part of that stability comes from the protected state of the 
System folder, as well as a number of other folders on your hard drive. 
If you displayed the Info dialog for the System folder, you’ll see that 
the Owner is set to system, and the Group is set to wheel (a term from 
the UNIX world that encompasses all administrator accounts). Now, 
promptly close that Info dialog, without making any changes!
 
✦ Never, never, never change any permissions for any files owned 
by the System unless specifically told to do so by an Apple support 
technician. Do not monkey with System-owned items.
 
 This last one is quite striking for a reason, so heed the warning.

Sharing Stuff in Office 2008
Many Mac OS X applications offer their own built-in document-sharing 
features. For example, Microsoft Office 2008 for the Mac includes both 
file-level and document-sharing features. Because Office 2008 is the most 
popular productivity suite available for Mac OS X, I discuss these commands 
in this final section.
Document-sharing features
You’ll find a number of commands that help multiple users keep track of 
changes that have been made in a shared Office document. Probably the 
most familiar is the Word revision tracking features (heavily used during the 
development of this book), but there are others as well:
 
✦ Revision marks: If several users edit a document, how can you tell 
who did what? By using revision marks, which apply different colors to 
changes made by different editors, those additions and deletions can be 
accepted or rejected individually at a later date. If Johnson in Marketing 
adds incorrect material, you can easily remove just his changes. In a 
worst-case scenario, you can actually reject all changes and return the 
document to its pristine condition.
 
✦ Compare Documents: Using this feature allows you to compare a 
revised document with the original (if, of course, you still have the 
original file handy). I use Compare Documents only if revision marks 
weren’t turned on before editing began.
 
✦ Comments: Editors can also converse within a document by using 
embedded Comments. These don’t change the contents of the Word 
file the way revision marks do, but store commentary and notes in a 
behind-the-scenes kind of way. (Think of a Mac OS X Stickie that 
appears within a document.) Again, the author of each comment is 
listed, allowing for (sometimes heated) communication within the 
body of a document.
 
✦ Highlighting: You’ve heard the old joke about . . . Well, anyway, a 
traditional highlighter marker is pretty useless on a computer monitor 
(leaving a nasty mess for the next user to clean), but Word allows 
multiple highlighting colors for identifying text. (And for the occasional 
practical joke — nothing like adding eight different highlighting colors to 
that important proposal. Just make sure that your résumé is up-to-date.)
File-level sharing features
Along with the document-level sharing commands, you’ll find that Office 
2008 applications also offer sharing features that control access to the 
document file itself.

248
Sharing Stuff in Office 2008
Password protection
You can add password protection to any Office 2008 document. Follow these 
steps with a document created within Word, Excel, or PowerPoint:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As.
 
2. In the Save As dialog that appears, click Options to display the Save 
Preferences pane.
 
3. Click the Show All toolbar button.
 
4. Click Security to display the Preferences pane that you see in Figure 6-2.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Office 2008 
offers two 
types of 
document 
passwords.
 
 
5. To password-protect the document, enter a password in the Password 
to Open field.
 
 This password must be provided when opening the document.
 
 If you like, you can enter another password in the Password to Modify 
field. This second password would then also be required to modify the 
document.
 
 Both passwords are case sensitive.
 
6. Click OK to save the preference changes and return to your document.

Document protection
Think of the Protect Document dialog in Word, from which you can effectively 
write-protect certain elements, as an extra level of security in a multiuser 
environment. In this Office application, you can protect revision marks, 
comments, and sections of a document containing forms. A password can 
be added if desired. To display the Protect Document dialog, click Tools in 
any of the Office 2008 applications and choose Protect Document from the 
pop-up menu that appears.

uzzah! After years of empty promises of professional-quality media

By using tightly integrated hardware and software (where everything works

includes iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto, GarageBand, iWeb, and iTunes. That same 
software also provides fantastic editing capabilities. Finally (and this is very 
important) — to paraphrase Will Smith in the movie Men in Black, “Apple 
makes these programs look good.”
First, Sliced Bread . . . and Now, the Digital Hub
In today’s overloaded world of personal electronic devices, people can try 
to juggle as many as five or six electronic wonders. Each device typically 
comes with its own software, power adapter, and connectors to the outside 
world. Although managing one or two devices isn’t terribly difficult, as the 
number of devices increases, so do the headaches. When you have a half-
dozen cables, power adapters, and software to cart around, the digital life 
can become pretty bleak. (And quite heavy. You’ll need more than a back-
pack to lug all that gear around.)
To combat this confusion, Apple came up with the idea of a digital hub, 
whereby your Macintosh acts as the center of an array of electronic devices. 
By using standardized cables, power requirements, built-in software, and 
even wireless connections via Bluetooth (the standard for short-range 
wireless communications between devices) and 802.11x wireless (for 
connections to your Ethernet network and your Apple TV unit), the 
Macintosh — along with its operating system, Mac OS X — goes a long way 
toward simplifying your interaction with all the electronic gadgets that you use.

254
What Does Digital Mean, Anyway?
Given the hub terminology, think of the digital hub as a wagon wheel. (See 
Figure 1-1.) At the center of the wheel is your Macintosh. At the end of each 
spoke is a digital device. Throughout the rest of Book III, I give you the 
skinny on each device, but this chapter gives you the overview and tells you 
how they all work together.
 
Figure 1-1: 
Hey, look 
what’s in 
the center 
of your 
digital hub!
 
What Does Digital Mean, Anyway?
Computers are handy machines. They can process information very quickly 
and never get bored when asked to do the same task millions of times. The 
problem is that despite their propensity for reliability and speed, they aren’t 
so hot in the intuition department. You have to tell them how to do everything 
(and most of them talk only to application developers and programmers). 
Computers know only one thing — numbers — although they do know 
numbers very, very well.
In fact, binary (the language of computers) has only two values — one and 
zero, which represent on and off, respectively. (Think of a light switch that 
toggles: The earliest computers were simply banks of switches that filled up 
an entire room.) To work with a computer in meaningful ways, you have to 
describe everything to a computer with numbers — or, if you prefer, digits.

Book III
Chapter 1

What Can I Digitize?
By describing audio in numerical digits, you suddenly have something that 
a computer can work with. Toss a computer as many numbers as you want, 
and it can handle them. The scientists who figured this out knew that they 
had a good thing going, so they proceeded to convert anything that they 
could get their hands on into . . . well, digits. (Sorry about the atrocious 
pun.) Anyway, this resulted in some interesting technologies, most of which 
you’ll surely recognize:
 
✦ Audio CDs: The music is represented as numbers and is stored on a 
plastic disc.
 
✦ Digital video: Images and sound are stored together on your hard drive 
or a DVD as one really, really long string of numbers.
 
✦ Digital fingerprints: (No pun intended this time.) Your fingerprint is 
converted into numerical data, which a computer can use to compare 
against fingerprint data from other people.
 
✦ Automated telephone operators: When you call a phone operator these 
days, you often aren’t speaking to a real person. Rather, the computer 
on the other end of the line converts your voice into digits, which it 
uses to interpret your words. (At other times, I think I’m talking to a real 
person, but it’s hard to tell.)
What Can I Digitize?
As you’ve probably guessed by now, practically anything can be digitized. As 
long as you can represent something as numbers, you can digitize that data. 
Whether it’s photographs, video, or audio, your Mac is adept at digitizing 
data and processing it.
Photographs
Perhaps the most popular of digital devices, the digital camera has transformed 
photography forever. By using sophisticated electronics, digital cameras 
convert the image that you see through the camera viewfinder into an image 
made purely of numbers.
After this numeric information is transferred to your Macintosh, your 
computer can cut, twist, fade, label, and paint your digital images. Because 
numbers are the only materials involved, you won’t need scissors, paint, or 
adhesive tape to edit images. (Advertising photographers can say good-bye 
to the old-fashioned airbrush.) Your Macintosh does it all by manipulating 
those numbers. It cuts down on the messy art supplies and gives you the 
comfort of being able to go back in time — something that anyone who’s not 
so handy with scissors can appreciate.

256
The Software That Drives the Hub
Music
As I mention earlier in this chapter, audio CDs are one application of music 
represented as digital data. The physical CD is just a piece of plastic with 
a metal coating, but you don’t even really need CDs any longer. Your 
Macintosh can digitize audio for storage on your hard drive, too, which 
brings up another important point. Not only is digital information palatable 
to a computer, it’s also very portable. You can store it on any number of 
storage devices, such as an iPod, a USB flash drive, or an external hard 
drive. (By the way, if you’re a musician, you can use GarageBand and 
external instruments that will turn your Mac into a combination of 
synthesizer, amplifier, and backup band. Mozart would’ve loved this stuff.)
Video
When you photograph a scene multiple times per second and then replay 
the sequence, you get (tah-dah!) moving pictures. In the analog (as opposed 
to digital) world, this would be a strip of celluloid film or magnetic tape. In 
the digital world, such a sequence of photographs is called DV, or digital 
video. After you take your digital video, you can transfer that data to your 
Macintosh to further manipulate it: You can edit it and add transitions, text, 
and other effects.
DVD
As is a CD-ROM or a hard drive, a DVD is simply a means of storing digital 
data. Although you can use it to save many different kinds of data, its most 
common use is for presenting video content. The Macintosh digital hub can 
produce DVDs by using any digital information you give it.
The Software That Drives the Hub
At the heart of your digital hub is your Macintosh. To use and manipulate 
all the data that arrives at your Mac, your computer needs software, which 
provides instructions on what to do with the information that you send. 
Fortunately, Apple has fashioned some of the most attractive and easy-to-
use software ever written to help you manipulate and manage your digital 
lifestyle. The list of software that belongs to the digital hub includes
 
✦ iPhoto: Use iPhoto to download, manipulate, and organize your favorite 
digital photographs. After everything is just so, iPhoto can print them, 
burn them to disc, or even help you design and order a hardbound 
album! (For way more on iPhoto, go to Book III, Chapter 3.)
 
✦ iTunes: iTunes offers the ability to create and manage your music and 
movie collection, along with sundry other media such as podcasts, 
Internet radio, audiobooks, and music videos. You can also purchase 
and download audio tracks and video from Apple’s iTunes Store. iTunes 
can even burn CDs! (Head to Book III, Chapter 2 for more.)

Book III

The Software That Drives the Hub
 
✦ iMovie: Every film director needs a movie-editing suite. iMovie gives you 
the chance to set up Hollywood in your living room with outstanding 
results. (For more, see Book III, Chapter 4.)
 
✦ iDVD: As home video moves toward the digital realm, iDVD becomes 
an essential tool for authoring your own DVD media. Home movies will 
never be the same! (iDVD is covered in Book III, Chapter 5.)
 
✦ GarageBand: Call it a “music-building” application! Even if you can’t 
play a note, GarageBand makes it easy to create your own original 
songs — and if you are a musician, you can turn your Mac into a 
production studio. The latest version can even help you learn how to 
play an instrument. (Turn to Book III, Chapter 6 for more.)
 
✦ iWeb: Interested in producing a professional-quality Web site, but afraid 
that you’ll have to give up your personal life to build and maintain it? 
Never fear; with iWeb you can join the Web publishing crowd the easy 
Apple way. (I cover iWeb like a blanket in Book III, Chapter 7.)
 
✦ iCal: To help keep your hectic digital lifestyle in order, iCal (which is 
included with Snow Leopard) offers complete calendar features. Besides 
tracking your dates and appointments on your Mac, you can publish 
calendars on the Web or share them with different parts of the digital 
hub. (Or, if you have an iPod, you can even download your appointments 
and carry ’em with you.)
 
✦ iSync: With so many digital devices at your disposal, it gets hard to 
keep them all straight. iSync is software for automatically synchronizing 
contact and calendar information between cellphones, your personal 
digital assistant (PDA), an iPod, the Mac OS X Address Book, and iCal. 
iSync is included with Snow Leopard.
iPhoto
What good is a camera without a photo album? iPhoto, Apple’s photography 
software, serves as a digital photo album. Use it to help you arrange and 
manage your digital photos. Beyond its functions as a photo album, iPhoto 
also gives you the ability to touch up your images through cropping, 
retouching, scaling, rotating, and red-eye reduction (photographically 
speaking, not morning-after speaking).
Besides offering editing features, iPhoto also works automatically with your 
digital camera. Simply plug in the camera to your Mac’s Universal Serial Bus 
(USB) port, and iPhoto knows it’s there. Need to transfer photos from the 
camera to your photo album? iPhoto can do that, too.
When you complete a collection of photographs that you find interesting, 
use iPhoto to help you publish them on the Internet or even to create your 
very own coffee-table book. (The latest in high-tech: a paper book.) And for 
those of you who still want that nifty wallet print to show off at work or a 
poster to hang on your wall, you can print them with your own printer or 

258
The Software That Drives the Hub
order them online through iPhoto. Orders made with iPhoto show up in your 
mailbox — the U.S. Postal Service physical one outside your domicile — a 
few days later.
iTunes
To help you wrangle your enormous digital music and movie collection, 
Apple offers iTunes (see Figure 1-2). For starters, iTunes is a sophisticated 
audio player for all your digital audio files. But iTunes is also handy for 
converting audio tracks from audio CDs to a number of popular digital audio 
file formats, such as AAC, MP3, and AIFF. After you import or convert your 
music into computer files, iTunes helps you manage and maintain your 
music collection. You can even listen to streaming online “radio stations,” 
24 hours a day. The latest version of iTunes even allows you to rent or buy 
videos and movies, either on your Mac or on your video-capable iPod.
 
Figure 1-2: 
With iTunes, 
you can buy 
music and 
video from 
the Apple 
Store.
 
Plus, Apple throws in the iTunes Store, where you can preview hundreds of 
thousands of songs and videos for up to 30 seconds each without spending 
a dime. (Podcast subscriptions are usually free, bucko.) If you latch onto 
something that you’d like to buy, you can use your credit card to purchase 
and download your media (either as individual tracks for 99 cents each, or 
as a complete album or movie for a package price). After the media that 
you’ve bought is comfortably nestled in iTunes, you can play it on your Mac, 
burn music to an audio CD, or download it to your iPod.

The Software That Drives the Hub
Why do I keep harping on the iPod? Well, as a proud owner of one, I’m glad 
you asked: Apple’s iPod is a versatile, lightweight audio and video player 
with hidden extras that James Bond would covet. It has enough capacity 
to store your entire collection of music and several movies, but it’s small 
enough to fit into your shirt pocket. With iTunes, you can instantly exchange 
media between your Macintosh and your iPod. You can also use iTunes to 
create audio and MP3 CDs for playback elsewhere. And the iPod even works 
as honest-to-goodness, back-up storage . . . you see, it also functions as a 
standard external USB 2.0 hard drive. An iPod can display text files and play 
games; you can carry even your Address Book contacts and iCal appointments 
with you with aplomb. (For the lowdown on iPod, peruse Book III, Chapter 2.)
iMovie
You needn’t restrict yourself to still images: Hook up your digital camcorder 
to your Mac as well. Use iMovie, the easy-to-use video editing application 
shown in Figure 1-3, to create and edit digital movies. 
 
Figure 1-3: 
iMovie can

With stunning video-editing candy such as transitions, sound effects, and 
video effects, iMovie turns your home movies into professional productions 
that you’ll be proud to share with friends and family. Finally, you can have a 
home-movie night without putting everyone to sleep.

Can I Use All This Stuff at One Time?
iDVD
Of course, after you create a video masterpiece, you probably want to 
save it on a DVD for preservation and future viewing. To help you in your 
endeavors, use iDVD to create — or, as video professionals call it, author — 
DVD movies. With the preset templates, iDVD will have you cranking out 
stunning DVDs with interactive menus in no time, ready to use with any DVD 
player.
GarageBand
Imagine the freedom to create your own original music by simply dragging 
“digital instruments” onto a canvas . . . and then adding your own voice or 
the lead instrument! After the basic melody is in place, you’d want to be 
able to edit whatever you like, or even choose different instruments with 
the click of a mouse. As recently as ten years ago, dear reader, that concept 
was indeed just a dream. Then, software-based synthesizers and mixing 
applications brought musicians into the digital age. (The problem was that 
normal human beings couldn’t afford the expensive software or the sample 
libraries of literally thousands of different instruments.) With the addition 
of GarageBand, however, the iLife suite provides everything that you need 
to start making your own music (inexpensively) and then create MP3 files or 
burn your own audio CDs. And believe me, if I can create a techno track that 
actually hit the speakers at a local dance club, you can, too!
iWeb
In the days of old — I’m talking five or six years ago here — putting a Web site 
online meant hours of drudgery, usually with a so-called “what you see is what 
you get” page creation application. Problem was, “what you saw” was very 
rarely easy to create, and if you were actually successful in getting the results 
you wanted, you still had to get all that stuff to appear on a Web server 
somewhere so that visitors could actually see it. With iWeb, the creation of a 
Web site is intuitive, easy, and downright fun! Click and drag your way to the 
Web site you want, starting with a number of truly outstanding predesigned 
templates. Add all sorts of cool pages, such as blogs and automated online 
photo albums. And the best part? Click a couple of buttons, and your new 
work of online art appears automatically on your MobileMe Web site, or as a 
group of files that’s ready for uploading to your Web server. Voilà!
Can I Use All This Stuff at One Time?
What makes the digital hub idea even juicier is that it’s an interoperable 
model. Let’s pause to appreciate that. (What, you don’t speak engineer? No 
problem!) In plain English, the digital hub allows you to use digital media 
from one part of the hub with another part of the hub. Thus, the individual 
parts of the digital hub can work together to complement each other. To 
illustrate, consider some digital-sharing scenarios:

Book III
Chapter 1
The World 
According to Apple
261
Can I Use All This Stuff at One Time?
 
✦ You shoot a great photograph of your kids. It’s so great, in fact, that 
you’d like to use it as the title screen of your family’s home movie. With 
the digital hub, you can use that same photograph in iMovie to create 
your home flick. When you’re done with that, transfer the whole thing 
to a DVD by using iDVD, and your masterpiece is safe for decades of 
viewing. One image just worked its way through three parts of the 
digital hub.
 
✦ You just recorded a catchy song with GarageBand. You add the song 
to the soundtrack of the music video that you’re creating with iMovie. 
Then you create a fancy opening menu and burn the finished project to 
DVD with iDVD to show prospective agents. Again, one piece of media 
has traveled through three parts of the digital hub!
 
✦ Your band becomes popular and starts to play some impressive gigs. 
To document your band’s rise to stardom, your friend films a concert 
with a DV camcorder. You use iMovie to transfer the video to your 
Macintosh and create clips of your favorite performances of the concert. 
The clips are transferred over to the primo Web site you’ve created with 
iWeb, and your band’s Internet image takes off! After that, it’s a simple 
matter to author to DVD with iDVD, extract the audio from the video for 
use as an MP3 with iTunes, and grab an image from the video for a band 
scrapbook that you’re creating with iPhoto. Now you’ve attained honest-
to-goodness DHH (shorthand for Digital Hub Heaven). You’ve traversed 
the entire hub, easily sharing the media along the way.
 
Lest I forget, I should mention the other advantage of the digital hub: The 
media that you swap between all your “iApplications” remains in digital 
form, which is A Good Thing! In the previous example of shooting a concert, 
for instance, that concert footage remained practically pristine while it was 
being transferred to DVD, converted to MP3, pasted into your iPhoto album, 
or uploaded to your iWeb site. (Because some audio and video formats are 
compressed to save space, such as MP3, a purist will argue that you lost a 
little something. It ain’t much.) Unlike with archaic analog VHS tape, you 
don’t have to worry about whether your source is second generation — and 
you can forget degradation and that silly tracking control.

ood news! It’s time to throw out your Dad’s Hi-Fi from the early ’70s 
(you know, the one with the 4-inch speakers that you’re embarrassed 
to show your friends). Every installation of Mac OS X comes with the finest 
stereophonic gadget in town: a great audio application called iTunes. With 
iTunes, you can listen to your favorite songs and podcasts, organize your 
music collection, watch a video or a full-length movie, listen to radio sta-
tions from around the world, buy music and video online, burn CDs and 
DVDs, and much more! iTunes has so many features that you’ll soon find 
yourself wondering why you even own a stereo at all. In no time, you’ll be 
pondering how much new speakers with a subwoofer will cost for your Mac.
In this chapter, I show you how to play audio CDs, podcasts, videos, and 
Internet radio, but that’s just the beginning. You discover how to use 
iTunes’ Library to get one-click access to any song in your collection. I 
even show you how to tune into Internet radio (and share your favorite 
songs with others on your network), burn audio CDs (if you have the neces-
sary hardware), plug in your iPod, and buy the latest hits from the iTunes 
Store. Heck, iTunes can even suggest new music for your library based on 
what you’re listening to now. (And I demonstrate how to make your iTunes 
window look just as good as your music sounds, with visualizations.)
Just in case, though, keep your Dad’s Hi-Fi . . . it might fetch a hefty sum as 
an antique on eBay.

What Can I Play on iTunes?
What Can I Play on iTunes?
Simply put, iTunes is a media player; it plays audio and video files. These 
files can be in any of many different formats. Some of the more common 
audio formats that iTunes supports are
 
✦ MP3: The small size of MP3 files has made them popular for file trading 
on the Internet. You can reduce MP3 files to a ridiculously small size (at 
the expense of audio fidelity), but a typical CD-quality, three-minute pop 
song in MP3 format has a size of 3–5MB.
 
✦ AAC: AAC (short for Advanced Audio Coding) is an audio format that’s 
very similar to MP3; in fact, AAC files offer better recording quality at 
the same file sizes. However, this format originally supported a built-in 
copy protection scheme that prevented AAC music from being widely 
distributed on Macs. (Luckily, this copy protection is no longer applied 
to iTunes tracks, and you can still burn protected AAC tracks to an 
audio CD, just as you can MP3 tracks.) The tracks that you download 
from the iTunes Store are in AAC format.
 
 The iTunes Store’s iTunes Plus tracks are also in AAC format, but these 
tracks are not copy-protected, and they’re encoded at a higher-quality 
256 Kbps rate — hence their higher price.
 
✦ Apple Lossless: Another format direct from Apple, Apple Lossless 
format provides the best compromise between file size and sound qual-
ity: These tracks are encoded without loss of quality. However, Apple 
Lossless tracks are somewhat larger than AAC, so it’s generally the 
favorite of the most discerning audiophile for his or her entire music 
library.
 
✦ AIFF: The standard Macintosh audio format produces sound of the abso-
lute highest quality. This high quality, however, also means that the files 
are pretty doggone huge. A typical pop song in AIFF format has a size of 
30–50MB.
 
✦ WAV: Not to be outdone, Microsoft created its own audio file format 
(WAV) that works much like AIFF. It can reproduce sound at higher qual-
ity than MP3, but the file sizes are very large, very similar in size to AIFF 
files.
 
✦ CD audio: iTunes can play audio CDs. Because you don’t usually store 
CD audio anywhere but on an audio CD, file size is no big whoop.
 
✦ Movies and video: You can buy and download full-length movies, TV 
shows, music videos, and movie trailers from the iTunes Store . . . and, 
with an Apple TV unit connected to your home theater system, you can 
watch those movies and videos from the comfort of your sofa on the 
other side of your house.

Playing an Audio CD
 
✦ Podcasts: These audio downloads are like radio programs for your 
iPod — but iTunes can play and organize them, too. Some podcasts also 
include video and photos to boot.
 
✦ Ringtones: iPhone owners, rejoice! iTunes automatically offers to create 
ringtones for your iPhone from the tracks you’ve bought from the 
iTunes Store.
 
✦ Audiobooks: No longer do you need cassettes or audio CDs to enjoy 
your spoken books — iTunes can play them for you, or you can send 
them to your iPod for listening on the go.
 
✦ Streaming Internet radio: You can listen to a continuous broadcast of 
songs from one of tens of thousands of Internet radio stations, with qual-
ity levels ranging from what you’d expect from FM radio to the full qual-
ity of an audio CD. You can’t save the music in iTunes, but it’s still great 
fun. (In fact, I run my own station . . . more on MLC Radio later in the 
chapter.)
Playing an Audio CD
Playing an audio CD in iTunes is simple. Just insert the CD in your com-
puter’s disc tray or disc slot start iTunes by clicking its icon in the Dock, 
and click the Play button. (Note that your Mac might be set to automatically 
launch iTunes when you insert an audio CD.) The iTunes interface resembles 
that of a traditional cassette or CD player. The main playback controls of the 
iTunes are Play, Previous Song, Next Song, and the volume slider, as shown 
in Figure 2-1.
Click the Play button to begin listening to a song. While a song is playing, the 
Play button toggles to a Pause button. As you might imagine, clicking that 
button again pauses the music. If you don’t feel like messing around with a 
mouse, you can always use the keyboard. The spacebar acts as the Play and 
Pause buttons. Press the spacebar to begin playback; press it again to stop.
Click the Next Song button to advance to the next song on the CD. The 
Previous Song button works like the Next Song button but with a slight 
twist: If a song is currently playing and you click the Previous Song button, 
iTunes first returns to the beginning of the current song (just like an audio 
CD player). To advance to the previous song, double-click the Previous Song 
button. To change the volume of your music, click and drag the volume 
slider.

Playing Digital Audio and Video
In addition to playing audio CDs, iTunes can play the digital audio files that 
you download from the Internet or obtain from other sources in the WAV, 
AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and MP3 file formats. Enjoying a digital audio 
file is just slightly more complicated than playing a CD. After download-
ing or saving your audio files to your Mac, open the Finder and navigate to 
wherever you stored the files. Then simply drag the music files (or an entire 
folder of music) from the Finder into the Music entry in the iTunes Source 
list. (The added files appear in the Music section of your iTunes Library. 
Think of the Library as a master list of your digital media. To view the Music 
Library, select the Music entry in the left-hand column of the iTunes player, 
as shown in Figure 2-2. Go figure.) Heck, you can also drag a song file from a 
Finder window and drop it on the iTunes icon in the Dock, which adds it to 
your Music Library as well.
 
Figure 2-2: 
The Music 
Library

268
Playing Digital Audio and Video
 
If you drop the file on top of a playlist name in the Source list, iTunes adds it 
to that particular playlist as well as the main Library. (More about playlists 
in a bit.)
To play a song, just double-click it in the Music list. Alternatively, you can 
use the playback controls (Play, Previous Song, and Next Song) that I dis-
cuss earlier in this chapter (refer to Figure 2-1).
 
The Source list of iTunes can list up to five possible sources for music:
 
✦ Library: This section includes Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, 
Audiobooks, iPod Games, and Radio. (Think Internet radio, which I 
discuss further in the section “iTunes Radio.”)
 
✦ Devices: If an iPod is connected, it appears in the list. (And yes, Virginia, 
other models of MP3 players from other companies will also appear in 
the list if they support iTunes.)
 
✦ Store: I discuss this later, in the section “Buying Digital Media the 
Apple Way.”
 
✦ Audio CD: A standard audio CD . . . anything from the Bee Gees to Fall 
Out Boy.
 
✦ Shared: If another Mac on your local network is running iTunes and is 
set to share part or all of its library, you can connect to the other com-
puter for your music. (Shared music on another Mac appears as a sepa-
rate named folder in the Source list.)
 
✦ Playlists: Think of playlists as folders you use to organize your music. 
(More on playlists later in this chapter.)
 
If you’ve invested in an Apple TV, it will appear in the list as well, allowing 
iTunes to share media with your Apple TV, which in turn sends it to your ED- 
or HD-TV.
Notice also that the Library lists information for each song that you add to 
it, such as
 
✦ Song Name: The title of the song
 
✦ Time: The length of the song
 
✦ Artist: The artist who performs the song
 
✦ Album: The album on which the song appears

If some of the songs that you’re adding don’t display anything for the title, 
album, or artist information, don’t panic; most MP3 files have embedded 
data that iTunes can read. If a song doesn’t include any data, you can always 
add the information to these fields manually. I show you how later, in the 
section “Setting or changing the song information manually.”
 
Clicking any of the column headings in the Library causes iTunes to reorder 
the Library according to that category. For example, clicking the Song Name 
column heading alphabetizes your Library by song title. I click the Time 
heading often to sort my Library according to the length of the songs. Oh, 
and you can drag column titles to reorder them any way you like (as long as 
the Name column remains at the far left).
 
iTunes can display your Music Library in three ways: By default, the applica-
tion uses the list view you see in Figure 2-1, where each song is one entry. 
Click the second View button (at the top of the iTunes window) to group 
tracks together by album artwork in grid view. Click the third View button, 
and you’re browsing by album cover in cover flow view, complete with reflec-
tive surface!
Browsing the Library
After you add a few dozen songs to iTunes, viewing the Library can become 
a task. Although a master list is nice for some purposes, it becomes as cum-
bersome as an elephant in a subway tunnel if the list is very long. To help 
out, iTunes can display your Library in another format, too: namely, brows-
ing mode. To view the Library in browsing mode, click the View menu and 
click the Show Browser item, or press the Ô+B keyboard shortcut.
The Browse mode of iTunes displays your library in a compact fashion, orga-
nizing your tunes into four sections:
 
✦ Genre
 
✦ Artist
 
✦ Album
 
✦ Song Name
Selecting an artist from the Artist list causes iTunes to display that artist’s 
albums in the Album list. Select an album from the Album list, and iTunes 
displays that album’s songs in the bottom section of the Browse window. 
(Those Apple software designers . . . always thinking of you and me.)

Playing Digital Audio and Video
 
Will I trash my Count Basie?
Novice iTunes users, take note: iTunes watches 
your back when you trash tracks.
To illustrate: Suppose you delete a song from 
the Library that’s located only in the iTunes 
music folder (which you didn’t copy into iTunes 
from another location on your hard drive). That 
means you’re about to delete the song entirely, 
and there’ll be no copy remaining on your 
Mac at all. Rest assured, though, that iTunes 
prompts you to make sure that you really want 
to move the file to the Trash. (I get fearful e-mail 
messages all the time from readers who are 
loath to delete anything from iTunes because 
they’re afraid they’ll trash their digital music 
files completely.)
Remember: If you delete a song from the Library 
that also exists elsewhere on your hard drive 
(outside the reach of the iTunes music folder), 
it isn’t deleted from your hard drive. In fact, if 
you mistakenly remove a song that you meant 
to keep, just drag it back into iTunes from the 
Finder, or even from the Trash. ’Nuff said.
Finding songs in your Music Library
After your collection of audio files grows large, you might have trouble locat-
ing that Swedish remix version of “I’m Your Boogie Man.” To help you out, 
iTunes has a built-in Search function. To find a song, type some text into the 
search field of the main iTunes window. While you type, iTunes tries to find 
a selection that matches your search text. The search is quite thorough, 
showing any matching text from the artist, album, song title, and genre fields 
in the results. For example, if you type Electronic into the field, iTunes might 
return results for the band named Electronic or other tunes that you classi-
fied as electronic in the Genre field. (The section “Know Your Songs,” later 
in this chapter, tells you how to classify your songs by genre, among other 
options.) Click the magnifying glass at the left side of the Search field to 
restrict the search even more: by Artists, Albums, Composers, and Songs.
Removing old music from the Library
After you spend some time playing songs with iTunes, you might decide that 
you didn’t really want to add 40 different versions of “Louie Louie” to your 
Library. (Personally, I prefer either the original or the cast from the movie 
Animal House.) To remove a song from the Library, click the song to select it 
and then press the Delete key on your keyboard.
 
You can also remove a song from the Library by dragging it to the Trash in 
your Dock.

Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists
Watching video
Watching video in iTunes is similar to listening to your music. To view your 
video collection, click one of these entries in the Source list:
 
✦ Movies
 
✦ TV Shows
If you select Movies or TV Shows, iTunes displays your videos as thumbnails 
or in cover flow view. Music videos appear as a smart playlist.
From your collection, you can
 
✦ Double-click a video thumbnail or an entry in the list.
 
✦ Drag a QuickTime–compatible video clip from the Finder window to the 
iTunes window. (These typically include video files ending in .mov or 
.mp4.)
iTunes plays video in the box below the Source list or in full-screen mode, 
depending on the settings you’ve chosen on the General pane in the iTunes 
Preferences window. In full-screen mode, move your mouse to display a con-
trol strip at the bottom of the screen, sporting the standard slider bar that 
you can drag to move through the video (as well as a volume control and 
Fast Forward/Reverse buttons). You can also pause the video by clicking the 
Pause button.
Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: 
Organizing with Playlists
As I mention earlier, the iTunes Music Library can quickly become a fear-
somely huge beastie. Each Library can contain thousands upon thousands 
of songs: If your Library grows anywhere near that large, finding all the 
songs in your lifelong collection of Paul Simon albums is not a fun task. 
Furthermore, with the Library, you’re stuck playing songs in the order that 
iTunes lists them.
To help you organize your music into groups, use the iTunes playlist feature. 
A playlist is a collection of some of your favorite songs from the Library. You 
can create as many playlists as you want, and each playlist can contain any 
number of songs. Whereas the Library lists all available songs, a playlist dis-
plays only the songs that you add to it. Further, any changes that you make 
to a playlist affect only that playlist, leaving the Library intact.

272
Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists
To create a playlist, you can do any of the following:
 
✦ Choose File➪New Playlist.
 
✦ Press Ô+N.
 
✦ Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection. This creates a new playlist 
and automatically adds any tracks that are currently selected.
 
✦ Click a song to select it; then click the Genius button at the lower-
right corner of the window. (The Genius button bears a striking “atom” 
symbol.) iTunes builds a playlist of songs that are similar in some 
way (typically by matching the genre of the selection or the beats per 
minute, but also based on recommendations from other iTunes mem-
bers). Note that your Mac needs an Internet connection to create a 
Genius playlist, and the larger your music library the longer it will take 
iTunes to build your playlist.
 
✦ Click the iTunes DJ entry in the Playlist section at the left side of the 
window. iTunes delivers a random selection of songs taken from your 
iTunes Music Library — perfect for your next spontaneous party! You 
can change the order of the songs in the iTunes DJ playlist (known as 
Party Shuffle in older versions of iTunes), add songs from your Library, 
or delete songs that don’t fit the scintillating ambience of your gather-
ing. Enjoy!
 
✦ Click the New Playlist button in the iTunes window (the plus sign 
button in the lower-left corner). You get a newly created empty playlist 
(the toe-tappin’ untitled playlist).
All playlists appear in the Source list. To help organize your playlists, it’s 
a good idea to . . . well, name them. (Aren’t you glad now that you have 
this book?) For example, suppose that you want to plan a party for your 
polka-loving friends. Instead of running to your computer after each song 
to change the music, you could create a polka-only playlist. Select and 
start the playlist at the beginning of the party, and you won’t have to worry 
about changing the music the whole night. (You can concentrate on the 
accordion.) To load a playlist, select it in the Source list; iTunes displays the 
songs for that playlist.
The same song can appear in any number of playlists because the songs in a 
playlist are simply pointers to songs in your Music Library — not the songs 
themselves. Add and remove them at will to or from any playlist, secure in 
the knowledge that the songs remain safe in the Library. Removing a playlist 
is simple: Select the playlist in the Source list and then press Delete.
 
Removing a playlist doesn’t actually delete any songs from your Library.

Know Your Songs
 
Some playlists are smarter than others
Click the File menu and you’ll see the New 
Smart Playlist menu command. The contents of 
a smart playlist are automatically created from 
a specific condition or set of conditions that you 
set via the Smart Playlist dialog: You can limit 
the track selection by mundane things, such as 
album, genre, or artist; or you can get funky and 
specify songs that were played last, or by the 
date you added tracks, or even by the sampling 
rate or total length of the song. For example, 
iTunes can create a playlist packed with songs 
that are shorter than three minutes, so you can 
fill your iPod Shuffle with more stuff! Ah, but 
wait, you’re not limited to a single criterion. If 
you want to add other criterion, click the plus 
sign at the right side of the dialog and you get 
another condition field to refine your selection 
even further.
You can choose the maximum songs to add to 
the smart playlist, or limit the size of the playlist 
by the minutes or hours of play or the number of 
megabytes or gigabytes the playlist will occupy. 
(Again, great for automatically gathering as 
much from your KISS collection that will fit into 
a specific amount of space on a CD or your 
iPod.) Mark the Live Updating check box for the 
ultimate in convenience. iTunes automatically 
maintains the contents of the smart playlist to 
keep it current with your conditions at all times 
in the future. (If you remove tracks manually 
from a smart playlist, iTunes adds other tracks 
that match your conditions.)
Now think about what all these settings mean 
when combined . . . whoa. Here’s an example 
yanked directly from my own iTunes library. I 
created a smart playlist that selects only those 
songs in the Rock genre. It’s limited to 25 songs, 
selected by least often played, and live updat-
ing is turned on. The playlist is named Tracks 
I’ve Gotta Hear because it finds the 25 rock 
songs (from my collection of 1,654 songs) that 
I’ve heard least often! After I listen to a song 
from this smart playlist, iTunes automatically 
“freshens” it with another song, allowing me 
to catch up on the tracks I’ve been ignoring. 
Completely, unbelievably sweet — and another 
reason that iTunes is the best music player on 
Planet Earth!
Know Your Songs
Besides organizing your music into Elvis and non-Elvis playlists, iTunes gives 
you the option to track your music at the song level. Each song that you add 
to the Music Library has a complete set of information associated with it. 
iTunes displays this information in the Info dialog, including
 
✦ Name: The name of the song
 
✦ Artist: The name of the artist who performed the song
 
✦ Composer: The name of the astute individual who actually wrote the song
 
✦ Album Artist: The name of the artist responsible for a compilation or 
tribute album
 
✦ Album: The album where the song appears
 
✦ Grouping: A group type that you assign

274
Know Your Songs
 
✦ Year: The year the artist recorded the song
 
✦ BPM: The beats per minute (which indicates the song’s tempo)
 
✦ Track Number: The position of the song on the original album
 
✦ Disc Number: The original disc number in a multi-CD set
 
✦ Comments: A text field that can contain any comments on the song
 
✦ Genre: The classification of the song (such as rock, jazz, or pop)
You can display this information by clicking a song name and pressing 
Ô+I — the fields appear on the Info tab.
Setting the song information automatically
Each song that you add to the iTunes Music Library might have song infor-
mation included with it. If you add music from a commercial audio CD, 
iTunes connects to a server on the Internet and attempts to find the infor-
mation for each song on the CD. If you download a song from the Internet, 
it often comes with some information embedded in the file already; the 
amount of included information depends on what the creator supplied. (And 
believe me, it’s often misspelled as well — think Leenard Skeenard.) If you 
don’t have an Internet connection, iTunes can’t access the information and 
displays generic titles instead.
Setting or changing the song information manually
If iTunes can’t find your CD in the online database or someone gives you an 
MP3 with incomplete or inaccurate information, you can change the informa-
tion yourself — believe me, you want at least the artist and song name! To 
view and change the information for a song, perform the following steps:
 
1. Select the song in either the Music Library list or a Playlist.
 
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info.
 
3. Edit the song’s information on the Info tab, as shown in Figure 2-3.
Keep in mind that the more work you put into setting the information of 
the songs in your Music Library, the easier it is to browse and use iTunes. 
Incomplete song information can make it more difficult to find your songs in 
a hurry. If you prefer, you don’t have to change all information about a song 
(it just makes life easier later if you do). Normally, you can get away with set-
ting only a song’s title, artist, and genre. The more information you put in, 
however, the faster you can locate songs and the easier they are to arrange. 
iTunes tries to help by automatically retrieving known song information, but 
sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves and do a little work. (Sorry, but 
the DataElves are out to lunch.)

“What about cover art, Mark?” Well, I’m overjoyed that you asked! iTunes

adding large images can significantly increase the size of the song file.) 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the desired songs from the track list.
 
2. Click Advanced➪Get Album Artwork.
 
You can set iTunes to automatically attempt the addition of album artwork 
every time you rip tracks from an audio CD, or when you add songs without

Ripping Audio Files
 
By the way, if you buy tracks or an album from the iTunes Store, Apple 
always includes album covers automatically. Thanks, Steve!
Ripping Audio Files
You don’t have to rely on Internet downloads to get audio files: You can 
create your own MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV files from your 
audio CDs with iTunes. The process of converting audio files to different 
formats is called ripping. (Audiophiles with technical teeth also call this pro-
cess digital extraction, but they’re usually ignored at parties by the popular 
crowd.) Depending on what hardware or software you use, each has its own 
unique format preferences. For example, most iPod owners prefer MP3 or 
AAC files, but your audio CDs aren’t in that format. Being able to convert 
files from one format to another is like having a personal translator in the 
digital world. You don’t need to worry if you have the wrong format: You can 
simply convert it to the format that you need.
The most common type of ripping is to convert CD audio to MP3 (or AAC) 
format. To rip MP3s from an audio CD, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Launch iTunes by clicking its icon in the Dock.
 
 Alternatively, you can locate it in your Applications folder.
 
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences.
 
3. In the Preferences window that appears, click the General toolbar 
button.
 
4. Click the Import Settings button.
 
5. Choose MP3 Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu.
 
6. Choose High Quality (160 Kbps) from the Setting pop-up menu and 
then click OK.
 
 This bit rate setting provides the best compromise between quality (it 
gives you better than CD quality, which is 128 Kbps) and file size (tracks 
you rip will be significantly smaller than “audiophile” bit rates such as 
192 Kbps or higher).
 
7. Load an audio CD into your Mac.
 
 The CD title shows up in the iTunes Source list (under the Devices head-
ing), which is on the left side of the iTunes window. The CD track listing 
appears on the right side of the window.
 
 If iTunes asks you whether you want to import the contents of the CD 
into your Music Library, you can click Yes and skip the rest of the steps; 
however, if you’ve disabled this prompt, just continue with the remain-
ing two steps.

8. Clear the check box of any song that you don’t want to import from

 All songs on the CD have a check box next to their title by default. 
Unmarked songs aren’t imported.
 
 Notice that the Browse button changes to Import CD.
 
9. After you select the songs that you want added to the Library, click 
the Import CD button.
Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears
Besides the standard volume controls that I mention earlier in this chapter, 
iTunes offers a full equalizer. An equalizer permits you to alter the volume of 
various frequencies in your music, allowing you to boost low sounds, lower 
high sounds, or anything in between. Now you can customize the way your 
music sounds and adjust it to your liking.
To open the Equalizer (as shown in Figure 2-4), do one of the following:
 
Figure 2-4: 
Use the 
Equalizer 
sliders to 
tweak the 
sound of 
your music.
 
 
✦ Choose Window➪Equalizer.
 
✦ Press Ô+Option+2.
The Equalizer window has an impressive array of 11 sliders. Use the leftmost 
slider (Preamp) to set the overall level of the Equalizer. The remaining slid-
ers represent various frequencies that the human ear can perceive. Setting 
a slider to a position in the middle of its travel causes that frequency to 
play back with no change. Move the slider above the midpoint to boost that 
frequency; conversely, move the slider below the midpoint to reduce the 
volume of that frequency.
Continue adjusting the equalizer sliders until your music sounds the way you 
like it. When you close the Equalizer window, iTunes remembers your settings 
until you change them again. In case you prefer to leave frequencies to the 
experts, the iTunes Equalizer has several predefined settings to match most

After you adjust the sound to your satisfaction, close the Equalizer window 
to return to the iTunes interface and relax with those funky custom notes

A New Kind of Radio Station
Besides playing back your favorite audio files, iTunes can also tune in 
Internet radio stations from around the globe. You can listen to any of a 
large number of preset stations, seek out lesser-known stations not recog-
nized by iTunes, or even add your favorite stations to your playlists. This 
section shows you how to do it all.
iTunes Radio
Although it’s not a radio tuner in the strictest sense, iTunes Radio can locate 
virtual radio stations all over the world that send audio over the Internet — 
a process usually dubbed streaming amongst the “in” Internet crowd. iTunes 
can track down hundreds of Internet radio stations in a variety of styles with 
only a few mouse clicks.
To begin listening to Internet radio with iTunes, click the Radio icon located 
beneath the Library icon in the Source list. The result is a list of more than 
20 types of radio stations, organized by genre.
When you expand a Radio category by clicking its triangle, iTunes queries a 
tuning server and locates the name and address of dozens of radio stations 
for that category. Whether you like Elvis or not-Elvis (those passing fads, 
like new wave, classical, or alternative), something’s here for everyone. The 
Radio also offers news, sports, and talk radio.
 
What’s with the numbers next to the station names?
When choosing an Internet radio station, keep 
your Internet connection speed in mind. If 
you’re using a broadband DSL or cable connec-
tion — or if you’re listening at work over your 
company’s high-speed network — you can 
listen to stations broadcasting at 128 Kbps (or 
even higher). The higher the bit rate, the better 
the music sounds. At 128 Kbps, for example, 
you’re listening to sound that’s as good as an 
audio CD.
However, if you’re listening over a dial-up 
modem connection, iTunes can’t keep up with 
audio streaming at higher bit rates, so you’re 
limited to stations broadcasting at 56 Kbps or 
lower.

Tuning in your own stations
Although iTunes offers you a large list of popular radio stations on the Web, 
it’s by no means comprehensive. Eventually, you might run across a radio 
station that you’d like to hear, but it’s not listed in iTunes. Luckily, iTunes 
permits you to listen to other stations, too. To listen to a radio station that 
iTunes doesn’t list, you need the station’s Web address.
In iTunes, choose Advanced➪Open Audio Stream (or press Ô+U). In the 
Open Stream dialog that appears (as shown in Figure 2-5), enter the URL of 
your desired radio station and then click OK. Within seconds, iTunes tunes

“I have an itch to hear ‘Kung Fu Fighting’!”
This particular technology author has a prefer-
ence for a certain hot Net jam spot: MLC Radio, 
the Internet radio station I’ve been running for 
several years now. I call my station a ’70s Time 
Machine because it includes hundreds of clas-
sic hits from 1970–1979, inclusive. You hear 
everything from “Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo” 
by Rick Derringer to “Moonlight Feels Right” by 
Starbuck. (Hey, I’m summing up a decade here, 
so be prepared for both Rush and the Captain 
and Tennille, too.) The station broadcasts at 
128 Kbps (audio CD quality), so you need a 
broadband connection to listen. For the radio’s 
Internet address or help connecting to MLC 
Radio, visit my Web site at www.mlcbooks.
com — and then follow the steps in the next 
section to add MLC Radio to your playlists!
Radio stations in your playlists
If you find yourself visiting an online radio station more than once, you’ll be 
glad to know that iTunes supports radio stations in its playlists. To add a 
radio station to a playlist from the Radio list, do the following:
 
1. Open the category that contains the station you want to add to your 
playlist.
 
2. Locate the station that you want to add to your playlist and drag it 
from the Radio list to the desired playlist on the left.
 
 If you haven’t created any playlists yet, see the section “Keeping Slim 
Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists” earlier in this 
chapter to find out how.
Adding a radio station that doesn’t appear in the Radio list is a bit trickier 
but possible nonetheless. Even though iTunes allows you to load a radio 
station URL manually by using the Open Stream command in the Advanced 
menu, it doesn’t give you an easy way to add it to the playlist. Follow these 
steps to add a specific radio station to a playlist:
 
1. Add any radio station from the Radio list to your desired playlist.
 
 Any station in the list will do, as you’ll immediately change both the sta-
tion’s URL and name to create your new station entry in the Playlist.
 
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info to bring up the information dialog 
for that station.
 
3. Click the Summary section and change the URL by clicking the Edit

iSending iStuff to iPod
If you’re lucky enough (like me) to own an iPod, you’ll be happy to know that 
iTunes has features for your personal audio and video jukebox as well. iPods, 
Apple’s multimedia players, comprise an entire family of portable devices 
(ranging from $79 to about $299) that can hold anywhere from about 300 
songs to literally thousands of songs, as well as podcasts, photos, and video. 
This great gadget and those like it have become known world-wide as the 
preferred portable digital media player.
You connect your iPod to any Macintosh or Windows PC with USB 2.0 
ports with the included cable. After the iPod’s connected, it automatically 
synchronizes to the playlists in iTunes. The iPod and the iTunes software 
communicate with each other and figure out what items are in your iTunes 
Library (as compared with the iPod Library). If they discover songs, pod-
casts, and video in your iTunes Library that are missing from your iPod, the 
items automatically transfer to the iPod. Conversely, if the iPod contains 
stuff that’s no longer in iTunes, the iPod automatically removes those files 
from its drive.
 
Go back and reread that last sentence above about the iPod automatically 
removing files from its drive. (I’ll wait here.) Apple added this feature in 
an effort to be attentive to copyright concerns. The reasoning is that if you 
connect your iPod to your friend’s computer, you can’t transfer songs from 
the iPod to that computer. Of course, you could always look at it from the 
marketing perspective as a feature that makes sure your Mac and iPod are 
always in total sync. Whatever the case, pay close attention and read all 
warning dialogs when connecting to a computer other than your own, or you 
might wipe out your iPod’s library.
The best thing I can say about the iPod and iTunes combination is . . . well . . . 
that there isn’t anything else to say about them. The auto-sync feature is so 
easy to use, you forget about it almost immediately.
 
This chapter — even as long as it is — just can’t explain all the ins and outs 
of the iTunes/iPod relationship! For a complete look at both iTunes and the 
iPod, I can heartily recommend a fellow For Dummies book, iPod & iTunes 
For Dummies, 6th Edition, by Tony Bove (Wiley Publishing).

Burning Music to Shiny Plastic Circles
Besides being a great audio player, iTunes is adept at creating CDs, too. 
iTunes makes the process of recording songs to a CD as simple as a few 
mouse clicks. Making the modern version of a compilation (or mix) tape is 
easier than getting a kid to eat ice cream. iTunes lets you burn CDs in one of 
three formats:
 
✦ Audio CD: This is the typical kind of commercial music CD that you buy 
at a store. Most typical music audio CDs store 700MB of data, which 
translates into about 80 minutes of music.
 
✦ Data CD or DVD: A standard CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is recorded with the 
audio files. This disc can’t be played in any standard audio CD player 
(even if it supports MP3 CDs, which I discuss next). Therefore, you can 
listen to these songs only by using your Mac and an audio player, such 
as iTunes or a PC running Windows.

After your AirPort Express Base Station is 
plugged in and you connect your home stereo 
(or a boombox, or a pair of powered stereo 
speakers) to the stereo minijack on the Base 
Station, you see a Speakers pop-up list button 
appear at the bottom of the iTunes window. (If 
the Speakers button doesn’t appear, choose 
iTunes➪Preferences to open the Preferences 
dialog and click the Devices button on the 
toolbar. Make sure that the Look for Remote 
Speakers Connected with AirTunes check box 
is enabled.)
Click the Speakers button, and you can choose 
to broadcast the music you’re playing in iTunes 
across your wireless network. Ain’t technology 
truly grand?
 
✦ MP3 CD: As does the ordinary computer CD-ROM that I describe, an 
MP3 CD holds MP3 files in data format. However, the files are arranged 
in such a way that they can be recognized by audio CD players that sup-
port the MP3 CD format (especially boomboxes, DVD players, personal 
CD players, and car stereos). Because MP3 files are so much smaller 
than the digital audio tracks found on traditional audio CDs, you can fit 
as many as 160 typical 4-minute songs on one disc. These discs can also 
be played on your Mac via iTunes.
 
Keep in mind that MP3 CDs aren’t the same as the standard audio CDs that 
you buy at the store, and you can’t play them in older audio CD players that 
don’t support the MP3 CD format. Rather, this is the kind of archival disc 
that you burn at home for your own collection.
To begin the process, build a playlist (or select an existing playlist that you 
want to record). If necessary, create a new Playlist and add to it whatever 
songs you would like to have on the CD. (See the earlier section, “Keeping 
Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists,” if you need a 
refresher.) With the songs in the correct order, select the playlist. Click the 
Burn Disc button at the bottom of the iTunes window to commence the disc 
burning process. Click the desired recording format (again, usually Audio 
CD) in the Burn Settings dialog that appears.
 
To save yourself from sonic shock, I always recommend that you enable the 
Sound Check check box before you burn. iTunes will adjust the volume on 
all the songs on your audio CD so that they’ll play at the same volume level.
Ready to go? Click OK, and iTunes lets you know when the recording is 
complete.

Feasting on iTunes Visuals
Feasting on iTunes Visuals
By now, you know that iTunes is a feast for the ears, but did you know that 
it can provide you with eye candy as well? With just a click or two, you can 
view mind-bending graphics that stretch, move, and pulse with your music, 
as shown in Figure 2-6.
To begin viewing iTunes visuals, choose View➪Show Visualizer (or press 
Ô+T). Immediately, most of your iTunes interface disappears and begins 
displaying groovy lava lamp-style animations (like, sassy, man). To stop the 
visuals, choose View➪Hide Visualizer (or press Ô+T again). The usual sunny 
aluminum face of iTunes returns.
You can also change the viewing size of the iTunes visuals in the View menu. 
From the View menu item, choose Full Screen (or press Ô+F). To escape 
from the Full Screen mode, click the mouse or press Esc.
 
You can still control iTunes with the keyboard while the visuals are zooming 
around your screen. See Table 2-1 earlier in this chapter for a rundown on 
common keyboard shortcuts.
The iTunes Visualizer has many hidden features. While viewing the 
Visualizer, press ? to see a list of hidden Visualizer settings.
 
Backing up within iTunes
iTunes offers a built-in backup feature for your 
media library — I told you this was the best 
media player ever designed!
Choose File➪Library➪Back Up to Disc to 
start the process. You can choose to back up 
your entire iTunes library and all your playlists 
(which I recommend) or just the content you’ve 
purchased from the iTunes Store. Personally, 
if I lost everything in my collection except for 
what I’ve bought from the iTunes Store, I’d be 
just as crushed. . . . Back it all up, and you won’t 
be sorry.
Click Back Up, and iTunes will prompt you for 
blank CDs or DVDs. If you need to restore from 
your completed backup, just launch iTunes and 
load the first backup disc into your drive.
How often is often enough when it comes 
to backing up your content? That depends 
completely on how often your media library 
changes. The idea is to back up often enough 
so that you always have a recent copy of your 
media files close by.

But wait, more Easter eggs are to be found! Again, while viewing the 
Visualizer, press one of following keys:
 
✦ M: Changes the Visualizer pattern
 
✦ P: Changes the Visualizer color scheme
Press either of these keys repeatedly to cycle through the various patterns 
and color schemes lurking deep within the Visualizer. (Personally, I’m a 
random Visualizer guy . . . there are so many patterns and schemes, I just let 
my Mac do all the work.)
Additionally, you’ll find third-party Visualizer plug-ins available for down-
loading on Apple’s Web site and other Mac-related download sites — heck, 
some even display lyrics, karaoke-style! Choose a different Visualizer plug-in 
from the View➪Visualizer menu item. (Call me old-fashioned, but I like the 
default, iTunes Visualizer).
Buying Digital Media the Apple Way
Before we wave goodbye to the happy residents of iTunes iSland, I won’t 
forget to mention the hottest spot on the Internet for buying music and 
video: the iTunes Store, which you can reach from the cozy confines of 

286
Buying Digital Media the Apple Way
iTunes. (That is, as long as you have an Internet connection. If you don’t, it’s 
time to turn the page to a different chapter.) If you’re not in iTunes, go to 
www.apple.com/itunes/store.
Click the iTunes Store item in the Source list, and after a few moments you’re 
presented with the latest offerings. Click a link in the store list to browse 
according to media type, or click the Power Search link to search by song 
title, artist, album, or composer. The Back/Forward buttons at the top of 
the iTunes Store window operate much the same as those in Safari, moving 
you backward or forward in sequence through pages you’ve already seen. 
Clicking the Home button (which, through no great coincidence, looks like a 
miniature house) takes you back to the Store’s main page.
To display the details on a specific album, track, video, podcast, or audio-
book (whew), just click it. If you’re interested in buying just certain tracks 
(for that perfect road warrior mix), you get to listen to 30 seconds of 
any track — for free, no less, and at full sound quality. To add an item to 
your iTunes Store shopping cart, click the Add Song/Movie/Album/Video/
Podcast/Audiobook button (sheesh!). When you’re ready to buy, click the 
Shopping Cart item in the Source list and then click the Buy Now button. 
(At the time of this writing, tracks are usually 99 cents a pop, and an entire 
album is typically $9.99 . . . what a bargain! 
The iTunes Store creates an account for you based on your e-mail address, 
and it keeps secure track of your credit card information for future pur-
chases. After you use the iTunes Store once, you never have to log in or 
retype your credit card information again.
The tracks and files that you download are saved to a separate playlist 
called Purchased. After the download is finished, you can play them, move 
them to other playlists, burn them to CD or DVD, share ’em over your net-
work, or ship them to your iPod, just as you can any other item in your 
iTunes Library.
You can also put the Genius button to work for you, in league with the 
iTunes store. Click the Show Genius Sidebar button at the lower-right corner 
of the iTunes window — it looks like an arrow inside a square — and iTunes 
displays the Genius Sidebar, where iTunes recommends music that you can 
buy from the iTunes Store that’s similar to the albums in your Music Library. 
Click the button again to banish the sidebar.
Remember all those skeptics who claimed that buying digital audio and 
video could never work over the Internet because of piracy issues and high 
costs? Well, bunkie, hats off to Apple: Once again, our favorite technology 
leader has done something the right way!

Chapter 3: Focusing on iPhoto
In This Chapter
✓ Importing pictures from your hard drive or digital camera
✓ Organizing images with iPhoto
✓ Tweaking the appearance of photographs
✓ Sharing photos with your friends
F
or years, the Macintosh has been the choice of professional photogra-
phers for working with digital images — not surprising, considering the 
Mac’s graphical nature. Apple continues this tradition with iPhoto, a photog-
raphy tool for the home user that can help you organize, edit, and even pub-
lish your photographs. (It sports more features than a handful of Swiss army 
knives.) After you shoot your photos with a digital camera, you can import 
them into iPhoto, edit them, and publish them. You’re not limited to photos 
that you take yourself, either; you can edit, publish, and organize all kinds 
of digital image files. You can even create a photo album and use the iPhoto 
interface to order a handsome soft- or hard-bound copy shipped to you.
In this chapter, I walk you through an overview of what iPhoto can do. After 
that, I give you a brief tour of the controls within iPhoto so that you can see 
what features are available to you, including features for managing, printing, 
and publishing your photos.
Delving into iPhoto
In Figure 3-1, you can see most of the major controls offered in iPhoto ’09. 
(Other controls automatically appear when you enter different modes; I 
cover them in upcoming sections of this chapter.)

Although these controls and sections of the window are covered in more detail 
in the following sections, here’s a quick rundown of what you’re looking at:
 
✦ Source list: This list of image locations determines which photos iPhoto 
displays.
 
• You can choose to display either your entire image library or just the 
last “roll” of digital images that you downloaded from your camera.
 
• You can create new albums of your own that appear in the Source 
list; albums make it much easier to organize your photos.
 
• Photos can be grouped by Event (when they were taken), Faces (who 
appears in the photos), and Places (where photos were taken).
 
• You can create books, calendars, cards, and slideshows.
 
✦ Viewer: This pane displays the images from the currently selected 
photo source.

Book III
Chapter 3
Focusing on iPhoto

 You can drag or click to select photos in the Viewer for further tricks, 
such as assigning keywords and image editing.
 
✦ Create button: Click this button to add a new blank album, smart album, 
MobileMe gallery, book, calendar, card, or slideshow to your Source list.
 
✦ Get Info button: Click this button to display information on the cur-
rently selected photos.
 
✦ Enter Full Screen button: Click this button to switch to a full-screen 
display of your photos. In full-screen mode, the images in the selected 
album appear in a film strip across the top of the screen, and you can 
click one to view that image using your Mac’s entire screen real estate. 
You can also use the same controls that I discuss later in this chapter 
for editing and adjusting images; just move the mouse cursor to the top 
edge of the full-screen display to show the menu or to the bottom edge 
to show the editing toolbar.
 
✦ Play Slideshow: Select an event, album, book or slideshow in the Source 
list (or multiple images you’ve selected in the Viewer) and click this 
button to start a full-screen slideshow using those images.
 
✦ Search box: Click the button next to the Search text box to locate 
photos by specific criteria, or just click in the box and start typing to 
search by description and title.
 
✦ Toolbar buttons: This group of buttons selects an operation you want 
to perform on the images you’ve selected in the Viewer. (Note that the 
toolbar buttons you see may depend on your screen resolution.)
 
✦ Thumbnail Resize slider: Drag this slider to the left to reduce the size of 
the thumbnails in the Viewer. This allows you to see more thumbnails at 
one time, which is a great boon for quick visual searches. Drag the slider 
to the right to expand the size of the thumbnails, which makes it easier 
to differentiate details between similar photos in the Viewer.
Working with Images in iPhoto
Even a superbly designed image display and editing application, such as 
iPhoto ’09, would look overwhelming if everything were jammed into one 
window. Thus, Apple’s developers provide different operation modes (such 
as editing and book creation) that you can use in the one iPhoto window. 
Each mode allows you to perform different tasks, and you can switch modes 
at just about any time by clicking the corresponding toolbar button.
In this section, I discuss three of these modes — import, organize, and 
edit — and what you can do when you’re in them. Then I conclude the 
chapter with sections on publishing and sharing your images.

Import Images 101
In import mode, you’re ready to download images directly from your digital 
camera — as long as your specific camera model is supported in iPhoto. You 
can find out which cameras are supported by visiting the Apple iPhoto sup-
port page at www.apple.com/macosx/upgrade/cameras.html.
Follow these steps to import images:
 
1. Connect your digital camera to your Mac.
 
 Plug one end of a USB cable into your camera and the other end into 
your Mac’s USB port, and prepare your camera to download images.
 
2. Launch iPhoto.
 
 Your Mac will probably launch iPhoto automatically when your camera 
is detected, but you can always launch iPhoto manually by clicking its 
icon in the Dock (or in your Applications folder).
 
3. Type an event name for the imported photos, such as Birthday Party 
or Godzilla Ravages Tokyo.
 
4. Type a description for the Event.
 
5. To allow iPhoto to automatically separate images into separate events 
based on the date they were taken, click the Autosplit Events after 
Importing check box to select it.
 
6. Click the Import All button to import your photographs from the 
camera.
 
 The images are added to your Photo Library, where you can organize 
them as you wish.
 
 To select specific images to import, hold down the Ô key and click each 
desired photo; then click Import Selected instead of Import All.
 
7. Specify whether the images you’re importing should be deleted from 
the camera afterward.
 
 If you don’t expect to download these images again to another com-
puter or another device, you can choose to delete the photos from your 
camera automatically. This saves you a step, frees space for new photos 
and helps eliminate the guilt that can crop up when you nix your pix. 
(Sorry, I couldn’t resist.)

Importing images from your hard drive
If you have a folder of images that you’ve col-
lected already on your hard drive, a CD, a DVD, 
an external drive, or a USB flash drive, adding 
them to your library is easy. Just drag the 
folder from a Finder window and drop it into the 
Source list in the iPhoto window. iPhoto auto-
matically creates a new album using the folder 
name, and you can sit back while the images 
are imported into that new album. iPhoto rec-
ognizes images in several formats: JPEG, GIF, 
RAW, PNG, PICT, PSD, PDF, and TIFF.
If you have individual images, you can drag 
them as well. Select the images in a Finder 
window and drag them into the desired album 
in the Source list. To add them to the album cur-
rently displayed in the Viewer, drag the selected 
photos and drop them in the Viewer instead.
If you’d rather import images by using a stan-
dard Mac Open dialog, choose File➪Import to 
Library. Simplicity strikes again!
“What’s that about an Event, Mark?” After you download the contents of 
your digital camera, those contents count as a virtual Event in iPhoto — 
based on either the date that you imported them or the date they were 
taken. For example, you can always display the last images you imported by 
clicking Last Import. If you want to see photos from your son’s graduation, 
they appear as a separate Event. (Both of these organizational tools will 
appear in the Source list). Think about that . . . it’s pretty tough to arrange 
old-fashioned film prints by the moment in time that they document, but 
iPhoto makes it easy for you to see just which photos are part of the same 
group! I explain more about Events in the next section.
There are four methods of organizing photos: the album, which you may be 
familiar with from older versions of iPhoto, Events, Faces, and Places.
Organize mode: Organizing and sorting your images
In the days of film prints, you could always stuff another shoebox with your 
latest photos or buy another sticky album to expand your library. Your 
digital camera, though, stores images as files instead, and many folks don’t 
print their digital photographs. Instead, you can keep your entire collection 
of digital photographs and scanned images well ordered and easily retrieved 
by using iPhoto’s organize mode. Then you can display them as a slideshow, 
print them to your system printer, use them as Desktop backgrounds, or 
burn them to an archive disc.
A new kind of photo album
The most familiar method of organizing images in iPhoto is the album. Each 
album can represent any division you like, be it a year, a vacation, your 
daughter, or your daughter’s ex-boyfriends. Follow these steps:

292
Working with Images in iPhoto
 
1. Create a new album.
 
 You can either choose File➪New Album or click the plus (+) button at 
the bottom of the Source list. Click the Album button at the top of the 
sheet to display the settings you see in Figure 3-2.
 
Figure 3-2: 
Add a new 
album in 
iPhoto.
 
 
2. Type the name for your new photo album.
 
 If you want to create an empty album (without automatically includ-
ing any images that might be selected), make sure you click the Use 
Selected Items in New Album check box to deselect it.
 
3. Click OK.
iPhoto also offers a special type of album called a Smart Album, which you 
can create from the File menu. A Smart Album contains only photos that 
match certain criteria that you choose, using the keywords and rating that 
you assign your images. Other criteria text in the photo filenames, dates the 
images were added to iPhoto, and any comments you might have added. 
Now here’s the really nifty angle: iPhoto automatically builds and maintains 
Smart Albums for you, adding new photos that match the criteria (and delet-
ing those that you remove from your Photo Library)! Smart Albums carry a 
gear icon in the Source list.

Book III
Chapter 3
Focusing on iPhoto
293
Working with Images in iPhoto
You can display information about the currently selected item in the infor-
mation pane under the Source list. Just click the Show Information button 
at the bottom of the iPhoto window, which sports the familiar “i-in-a-circle” 
logo. You can also type a short note or description in the Description box 
that appears in the Information pane. For more in-depth information, select 
the desired item and then press Ô+I.
 
You can also change information on an image by selecting it in the Viewer and 
clicking the Show Information button. Click any of the headings in the pane 
(Title, Date, Time, and so on) to display a text edit box, and you can simply 
click in either box to type a new name or alter the photo’s date stamp.
You can drag images from the Viewer into any album you choose. For exam-
ple, you can copy an image to another album by dragging it from the Viewer 
to the desired album in the Source list.
To remove a photo that has fallen out of favor, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Source list, select the desired album.
 
2. In the Viewer, select the photo (click it) that you want to remove.
 
3. Press Delete.
 
When you remove a photo from an album, you don’t remove the photo from 
your collection (which is represented by the Photos entry under the Library 
heading in the Source list). That’s because an album is just a group of links 
to the images in your collection. To completely remove the offending photo 
from iPhoto, click the Photos entry under the Library heading to display 
your entire collection of images and delete the picture there, too.
To remove an entire album from the Source list, just click it in the Source list 
to select it — in the Viewer, you can see the images that it contains — and 
then press Delete. (Alternatively, right-click or Control-click the offending 
album and choose Delete Album from the pop-up menu.)
To rename an album, click the entry under the Albums heading in the Source 
list to select it and then click again to display a text box. Type the new album 
name and press Return.
 
Change your mind? Daughter’s ex is back in the picture, so to speak? iPhoto 
comes complete with a handy-dandy Undo feature. Just press Ô+Z, and it’s as 
though your last action never happened. (A great trick for those moments when 
you realize you just deleted your only image of your first car from your Library.)

294
Working with Images in iPhoto
Arranging stuff by Events
As I mention earlier, Events are essentially a group of images that you shot 
or downloaded at the same time — iPhoto figures that those images belong 
together (which is usually a pretty safe assumption). Figure 3-3 illustrates 
some of the Events I’ve created in my iPhoto collection.
 
As can an album, an Event can be renamed — you just use a different proce-
dure. Click the Events entry under the Library heading in the Source list to 
display your Events in the Viewer; then click the existing Event name in the 
caption underneath the thumbnail. A text box appears in which you can type 
a new name; click Return to update the Event.
Try moving your mouse cursor over an Event thumbnail in the Viewer and 
you’ll see that iPhoto displays the date range when the images were taken, 
as well as the total number of images in the Event. Ah, but things get really 
cool when you move your mouse cursor back and forth over an Event with 
many images: The thumbnail animates and displays all the images in the 
Event, without your using old-fashioned scroll bars or silly arrows! (Why 
can’t I think of this stuff? This is the future, dear readers.)
 
Notice that “i-in-a-circle” that appears when you hover your mouse cursor 
over an Event thumbnail? Click it to display the location where the shot was 
taken, using the Places feature I describe in a page or two.

Working with Images in iPhoto
To display the contents of an Event in the Viewer, just double-click the Event 
thumbnail. To return to the Events thumbnails, click the All Events button at 
the top of the Viewer.
 
Decided to merge those Prom Event pictures with your daughter’s 
Graduation Event? No problem! You could drag one Event thumbnail on top 
of another, but that’s the easy way. Alternatively, click the Events entry 
under the Library heading in the Source list to display your Events and then 
hold down Ô while you click the Events that you want to merge. Click the 
Merge button in the toolbar at the bottom of the window, or click 
Events➪Merge Events. (Forgot about that menu bar, didn’t you?) Click 
Merge in the confirmation dialog that appears. 
 
Whilst organizing, you can create a brand-new empty Event by clicking 
Events➪Create Event. Feel free to drag photos from albums, other Events, or 
your Photo library into your new Event.
Working with Faces and Places
iPhoto ’09 includes two new organizational tools called Faces and Places. 
These two categories now appear in the Library section of the Source list.
Putting names to faces:
First, let’s tackle Faces. This feature is a sophisticated recognition system 
that automatically recognizes human faces within the photos that you add 
to your Library. (I don’t know whether it works well with pets — but you can 
try, anyway.) Naturally, you have to identify faces first before iPhoto can rec-
ognize them, which it does through a process called tagging.
To tag a face, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Source list, click the Photos item to display your image library.
 
2. In the Viewer, click the photo with a person you want to tag.
 
 The photo is selected, as indicated by the yellow border.
 
3. Click the Name button in the iPhoto toolbar at the bottom of the 
window.
 
 iPhoto displays the tagging pane you see in Figure 3-4. Note that iPhoto 
has indicated each person’s face in the photo with a label.

296
Working with Images in iPhoto
 
Figure 3-4: 
Adding 
another 
mug to my 
collection of 
Faces.
 
 
4. If the face is unrecognized (labeled as unnamed), click the label to 
open a text box and type the person’s name.
 
 If iPhoto recognizes the face correctly and the name matches the 
person, click the check mark to confirm the tag. If the face is incorrectly 
identified, click the X and you can enter a new name.
 
 If the name appears on an Address Book contact card, you can click the 
matching entry that appears to confirm the identity. Wowzers!
 
 If iPhoto doesn’t recognize a face at all in the photo (which can happen 
if the person’s face is turned at an angle to the camera, or is in a darker 
area of the photo), click the Add Missing Face button, and iPhoto places 
a box in the center of the image. Drag the photo over the person’s face. 
If necessary, you can resize the box using the four handles at the corner 
of the box. Now you can click the label and type the person’s name.
 
5. Press Return to save the face.
 
 Notice the expansion button that appears next to the person’s name? 
Click it, and iPhoto displays other photos that likely contain this per-
son’s face, allowing you to tag them there as well.
 
6. Click Done after you’ve identified all the faces in the photo.

Book III
Chapter 3
Focusing on iPhoto
297
Working with Images in iPhoto
After you’ve tagged an image, it appears in your Faces collection, which you 
can view by clicking the Faces entry in the Source list. You can click a por-
trait in your Faces collection to see all the images that contain that person. 
As you might expect, the more tags you add for a specific person, the better 
iPhoto gets at recognizing that person!
Putting photos in their place:
Places makes it easy to track the location where photos were taken, but 
it requires a digital camera that includes GPS tracking information in the 
image metadata. (This is a relatively new feature for digital cameras, so 
older models aren’t likely to support GPS tracking.) Places also requires an 
Internet connection, because it uses Google Maps.
Click the Places entry in the Source list to display a global map, with push-
pins indicating where your photos were taken. You can switch the Places 
map between terrain and satellite modes, or choose a hybrid display. If 
you’re familiar with Google Maps, these settings are old friends of yours.
Alternatively, click the List View button to display a character-based 
browser, where you can click on country, state, and city names.
No matter which view mode you choose, clicking a pushpin or location dis-
plays the images taken in that area.
Organizing with keywords
“Okay, Mark, albums, Events, Faces, and Places are great ideas, but there 
has to be a way to search my collection by category!” Never fear, good Mac 
owner. You can also assign descriptive keywords to images to help you orga-
nize your collection and locate certain pictures fast. iPhoto comes with a 
number of standard keywords, and you can create your own as well.
To illustrate, suppose you’d like to identify your images according to 
special events in your family. Birthday photos should have their own key-
word, and anniversaries deserve another. By assigning keywords, you can 
search for Elsie’s sixth birthday or your silver wedding anniversary (no 
matter what Event or album they’re in), and all related photos with those 
keywords appear like magic! (Well, almost like magic. You need to choose 
View➪Keywords, which toggles the Keyword display on and off in the 
Viewer.)
iPhoto includes a number of keywords that are already available:
 
✦ Favorite
 
✦ Family
 
✦ Kids
 
✦ Vacation

298
Working with Images in iPhoto
 
✦ Birthday
 
✦ Movie
 
✦ Checkmark
 
What’s the Checkmark all about, you ask? It’s a special case: Adding this 
keyword displays a tiny check mark icon in the bottom-right corner of the 
image. The checkmark keyword comes in handy for temporarily identifying 
specific images because you can search for just your checkmarked photos.
To assign keywords to images (or remove keywords that have already been 
assigned), select one or more photos in the Viewer. Choose Window➪
Show Keywords or press Ô+K to display the Keywords window, as shown 
in Figure 3-5.
Click the keyword buttons that you want to attach to the selected images 
to mark them. Or click the highlighted keyword buttons that you want to 
remove from the selected images to disable them.

You’re gonna need your own keywords
I’ll bet you take photos of other things besides 
just kids and vacations — and that’s why iPhoto 
allows you to create your own keywords. 
Display the iPhoto Keywords window by press-
ing Ô+K, click the Edit Keywords button, and 
then click Add (the button with the plus sign). 
iPhoto adds a new unnamed keyword to the list 
as an edit box, ready for you to type its name.
You can rename an existing keyword from this 
same window, too. Click a keyword to select it 
and then click Rename. Remember, however, 
that renaming a keyword affects all the images 
that were tagged with that keyword. That might 
be confusing when, for example, photos origi-
nally tagged as Family suddenly appear with 
the keyword Foodstuffs. To remove an exist-
ing keyword from the list, click the keyword to 
select it and then click the Delete button, which 
bears a minus sign.
Digging through your library with keywords
Behold the power of keywords! To sift through your entire collection of 
images by using keywords, click the magnifying glass button next to the 
Search box at the bottom of the iPhoto window and then choose Keyword 
from the pop-up menu. iPhoto displays a pop-up Keywords panel, and you 
can click one or more keyword buttons to display just the photos that carry 
those keywords.
 
The images that remain in the Viewer after a search must have all the key-
words that you specified. If an image is identified, for example, by only three 
of four keywords you chose, it isn’t a match and it doesn’t appear in the 
Viewer. (You can create a Smart Album with specific keywords to get around 
this limitation.)
 
To search for a photo by words in its description, just click in the Search 
box and start typing. You can also click that same magnifying glass by the 
Search box to search through your images by date and rating as well. 
Speaking of ratings . . .
Playing favorites by assigning ratings
Be your own critic! iPhoto allows you to assign any photo a rating of any-
where from zero to five stars. I use this system to help me keep track of the 
images that I feel are the best in my library. Select one (or more) image and 
then assign a rating using one of the following methods:
 
✦ Choose Photos➪My Rating and then choose the desired rating from the 
pop-up submenu.
 
✦ Use the Ô+0 through Ô+5 shortcuts.

Working with Images in iPhoto
Sorting your images just so
The View menu provides an easy way to arrange your images in the Viewer 
by a number of different criteria. Choose View➪Sort Photos and then click 
the desired sort criteria from the pop-up submenu. You can arrange the dis-
play by date, keyword, title, or rating. If you select an album in the source 
list, you can also choose to arrange photos manually, which means that you 
can drag and drop thumbnails in the Viewer to place them in the precise 
order you want them.
 
Naturally, iPhoto allows you to print selected images, but you can also 
send photos directly to iWeb for use on your MobileMe Web site. Click 
Share➪Send to iWeb and then choose either Photo Page or Blog from the 
submenu. iPhoto automatically sends the selected images or album to iWeb 
and launches the application! You can also use iPhoto’s Web Gallery feature 
to get your photos on the Web. (More on the Web Gallery at the end of this 
chapter.)
Edit mode: Removing and fixing stuff the right way
Not every digital image is perfect — just look at my collection if you need 
proof. For those shots that need a pixel massage, iPhoto includes a number 
of editing tools that you can use to correct common problems.
The first step in any editing job is to select the image you want to fix in the 
Viewer. Then click the Edit button on the iPhoto toolbar to switch to the Edit 
mode controls, as shown in Figure 3-6. Now you’re ready to fix problems, 
using the tools that I discuss in the rest of this section. (If you’re editing a 
photo that’s part of an Event, album, Faces, or Places, note the spiffy scroll-
ing photo strip at the top, which allows you to switch to another image to 
edit from the same grouping.)
When you’re done with Edit mode, click the . . . (wait for it) . . . Done button!
Rotating tipped-over shots
If an image is in the wrong orientation and needs to be turned to display cor-
rectly, click the Rotate button to turn it once in a counterclockwise direction. 
Hold down the Option key while you click the Rotate button to rotate in a 
clockwise direction.
Crop ’til you drop
Does that photo have an intruder hovering around the edges of the subject? 
You can remove some of the border by cropping an image, just as folks once 
did with film prints and a pair of scissors. (We’ve come a long way.) With 
iPhoto, you can remove unwanted portions of an image; it’s a great way to 
get Uncle Milton’s stray head (complete with toupee) out of an otherwise 
perfect holiday snapshot.

Follow these steps to crop an image:
 
1. Click the Crop button in the Edit toolbar.
 
2. Select the portion of the image that you want to keep.
 
 In the Viewer, click and drag the handles on the rectangle to outline the 
part of the image that you want. Remember, whatever’s outside this 
rectangle disappears after the crop is completed.
 
 When you drag a corner or edge of the outline, a semi-opaque grid 
(familiar to amateur and professional photographers as the nine squares 
from the Rule of Three) appears to help you visualize what you’re claim-
ing. (Check it out in Figure 3-7.)
 
3. (Optional) Choose a preset aspect ratio.
 
 If you want to force your cropped selection to a specific aspect ratio — 
such as 4 x 3 for an iDVD project — click the Constrain check box and 
select that ratio from the Constrain pop-up menu.
 
4. Click the Apply button.
 
 Oh, and don’t forget that you can use iPhoto’s Undo feature if you mess 
up and need to try again. Just press Ô+Z.

iPhoto features multiple Undo levels, so you can press Ô+Z several times to

Straightening what’s crooked
Was your camera slightly tilted when you took the perfect shot? Never fear! 
Click the Straighten button and then drag the slider to tilt the image in the 
desired direction. Click the Close button to return to Edit mode.
Enhancing images to add pizzazz
If a photo looks washed out, click the Enhance button to increase (or 
decrease) the color saturation and improve the contrast. Enhance is auto-
matic, so you don’t have to set anything. 
Removing rampant red-eye
Unfortunately, today’s digital cameras can still produce the same “zombies 
with red eyeballs” as traditional film cameras. Red-eye is caused by a cam-
era’s flash reflecting off the retinas of a subject’s eyes, and it can occur with 
both humans and animals. (I’m told that pets get green-eye, actually, but 
iPhoto can handle that, too!)

Book III
Chapter 3

Producing Your Own Coffee-Table Masterpiece
iPhoto can remove that red- and green-eye and turn frightening zombies 
back into your family and friends! Click the Red-Eye button and then select 
a demonized eyeball by clicking in the center of it. (If the new eyeball is too 
small or too large, drag the Size slider to adjust the dimensions.) To com-
plete the process, click the X in the button that appears in the image.
Retouching like the stars
The iPhoto Retouch feature is perfect for removing minor flecks or lines 
in an image (especially those you’ve scanned from prints). Click Retouch 
and you’ll notice that the mouse cursor turns into a crosshair; just drag the 
cursor across the imperfection. 
Switching to black-and-white or sepia
Ever wonder whether a particular photo in your library would look better as 
a black-and-white (or grayscale) print? Or perhaps an old-fashioned sepia tone 
in shades of copper and brown? Just click the Effects button to display the 
Effects window, which offers eight different effects you can apply to the photo.
Adjusting photo properties manually
Click Adjust to perform manual adjustments to brightness and contrast (the 
light levels in your image), as well as the sharpness, shadow, and highlight 
levels. To adjust a value, make sure that nothing’s selected in the image and 
then drag the corresponding slider until the image looks the way you want. 
Click the Close button to return to Edit mode.
 
While you’re editing, you can use the Next and Previous buttons at the 
lower-right corner of the iPhoto window to move to the next image in the 
current group (or back to the previous image).
Producing Your Own Coffee-Table Masterpiece
Book mode unleashes what I think is probably the coolest feature of iPhoto: 
the chance to design and print a high-quality bound photo book! After you 
complete an album — all the images have been edited just the way you 
want, and the album contains all the photos you want to include in your 
book — iPhoto can send your images as data over the Internet to a company 
that prints and binds your finished book for you. (No, they don’t publish 
For Dummies titles, but then again, I don’t get high-resolution color plates in 
most of my books, either.)

304
Producing Your Own Coffee-Table Masterpiece
At the time of this writing, you can order many different sizes and bindings, 
including an 8.5-by-11-inch soft-cover book with 20 double-sided pages for 
about $20 and a hardbound 8.5-by-11-inch keepsake album with 10 double-
sided pages for about $30 (shipping included for both). Extra pages can be 
added at $0.70 and $1.00 a pop, respectively.
iPhoto ’09 can also produce and automatically order calendars and greeting 
cards, using a process similar to the one I describe in this section for pro-
ducing a book. Who needs that stationery store in the mall anymore?
 
If you’re going to create a photo book, make sure that the images have the 
highest quality and highest resolution. The higher the resolution, the better 
the photos look in the finished book. I personally always try to use images of 
over 1,000 pixels in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions.
To create a photo book, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the desired album in the Source list to select it.
 
2. Click the Keepsakes toolbar button and click Book from the pop-up 
menu.
 
 Depending on your screen resolution, iPhoto may have room to display 
the Book button by itself — no big deal, because things work the same.
 
3. Select the size of the book and a theme.
 
 Your choices determine the number of pages and layout scheme, as well 
as the background graphics for each page.
 
4. Click Choose.
 
 You’ll see the controls shown in Figure 3-8.
 
 In Book mode, the Viewer changes in subtle ways. It displays the current 
page at the bottom of the display and adds a scrolling row of thumbnail 
images above it. This row of images represents the remaining images 
from the selected album that you can add to your book. You can drag any 
image thumbnail into one of the photo placeholders to add it to the page. 
You can also click the Page button at the left of the thumbnail strip — it 
looks like a page with a turned-down corner — to display thumbnails of 
each page in your book. (To return to the album image strip, click the 
Photos button under the Page button.)
 
5. Rearrange the page order to suit you by dragging the thumbnail of 
any page from one location to another in the strip.

6. In the Book toolbar below the page view, you can adjust a variety of 
settings for the final book, including the book’s theme, background, 
page numbers, and text fonts.
 
 At this point, you can also add captions and short descriptions to the 
pages of your photo album. Click any one of the text boxes in the page 
display and begin typing to add text to that page.
 
7. When you’re ready to publish your book, click the Buy Book button.
 
8. In a series of dialogs that appears, iPhoto guides you through the final 
steps to order a bound book.
 
 Note that you’re asked for credit card information, so have that plastic 
ready.
 
I wouldn’t attempt to order a book through a dial-up modem connection. 
The images are likely far too large to be sent successfully. If possible, use a 
broadband or network connection to the Internet while you’re ordering. If 
your only connection to the Internet is through a dial-up modem, I recom-
mend saving your book in PDF format and having it printed at a copy shop 
or printing service instead. (Choose File➪Print and then click the Save as 
PDF button.)

You’ll Love MobileMe Gallery!
 
I really need a slideshow
You can use iPhoto to create slideshows! Click 
the album or Event you want to display and 
click the Add button; then choose Slideshow 
from the toolbar and click Create. Notice that 
iPhoto adds a Slideshow item in the Source list. 
The same scrolling thumbnail strip appears at 
the top of the Viewer — this time displaying the 
images in the album or Event. Click and drag the 
thumbnails so that they appear in the desired 
order.
To choose background music for your slide-
show, click the Music button in the Slideshow 
toolbar to display Apple’s theme music, as 
well as the tracks from your iTunes library. To 
choose a standard theme, click the Source 
pop-up menu and choose Theme Music; then 
select that perfect song and click Apply. To 
choose an iTunes song or playlist, click the 
Source pop-up menu and choose either the 
Music item (for your entire library) or a playlist. 
You can also create a custom playlist by select-
ing the Custom Playlist for Slideshow check 
box. Then drag the individual songs you want to 
the song list at the bottom of the sheet. (You can 
drag them to rearrange their order in the list as 
well.) Click Apply to accept your song list.
To configure your slideshow, click the Settings 
button in the Slideshow toolbar and click the 
All Slides tab. In the dialog that appears, you 
can specify the amount of time that each slide 
remains on the screen, as well as an optional 
title and rating displays. You can choose the 
transition that occurs between photos, too, 
or specify a random transition each time. 
Widescreen Mac owners appreciate the 
Aspect Ratio pop-up menu, which allows you 
to choose a 16:9 widescreen display for your 
slideshow.
Click the This Slide tab to modify the settings for 
a specific slide (useful for keeping a slide on-
screen for a longer period of time or for setting a 
different transition than the default transition you 
choose from the Slideshow toolbar). I can recom-
mend the Automatic Ken Burns effect — yep, the 
same one in iMovie — which lends an animated 
movement to the selected image. You can also 
set the selected photo to display in black and 
white, sepia, or antique coloring.
To display a preview of a single slide and its 
transitions, click the desired slide and then 
click Preview; this is a handy way of determin-
ing whether your delay and transition settings 
are really what you want for a particular slide. 
When you’re ready to play your slideshow, click 
the Play button, and iPhoto switches to full-
screen mode. You can share your completed 
slideshow by clicking Share in the iPhoto menu, 
where you can send the slideshow to iDVD (for 
later burning onto a DVD) or send it through 
e-mail.
You’ll Love MobileMe Gallery!
iPhoto ’09 includes a feature called MobileMe Gallery that does for images 
what podcasting does for audio: You can share your photos with friends, 
family, business clients, and anyone else with an Internet connection! (Your 
adoring public doesn’t even require a Mac; it can use That Other Kind of 
Computer.) iPhoto automatically uploads the selected images and leads you

You’ll Love MobileMe Gallery!
through the process of creating a new Web page to proudly display your 
photos. However, you must be a MobileMe subscriber to use the MobileMe 
Gallery feature. If you haven’t heard the news on Apple’s MobileMe service 
yet, see Chapter 4 of Book V for the details.
To create a MobileMe Gallery, you designate one or more photos in the 
Viewer (or even select entire albums or Events in the Source list) and then 
click the Add button. Click the MobileMe toolbar button in the sheet that 
appears to display the Web Gallery settings.
Type a name for your new Web Gallery. You can elect to show the title of 
each photo, allow your visitors to download your images or upload their 
own, and even allow photos to be uploaded by other computer owners using 
an e-mail or a Web browser!
 
By default, any visitor to your MobileMe Web site can see your gallery. But 
what if you prefer a little security for those images? In that case, click the 
Album Viewable By pop-up menu, where you can limit your viewing audi-
ence (you can even require that your visitors enter a login name and pass-
word before they can receive your photos).
Click Publish, and you’ll see that iPhoto indicates that your images are being 
uploaded with a cool twirling progress icon to the right of the album in the 
Source list. When the process is complete, iPhoto indicates that the photos 
appear in a MobileMe Gallery with a new heading in the Source list. You’re 
on the air!
Now for the other side of the coin: By selecting your MobileMe Gallery in the 
Source list and clicking Tell a Friend in the iPhoto toolbar, iPhoto automati-
cally prepares an e-mail message in Apple Mail that announces your new 
Gallery! Just add the recipient names and click Send. This spiffy message 
includes instructions for
 
✦ Folks using iPhoto ’09 on a Mac: As you can imagine, this is the easi-
est receive option to configure. After these folks are subscribed, they 
get an automatically updated album of the same name that appears in 
their Source list, and they can use those images in their own iPhoto proj-
ects! From within iPhoto, your visitors can subscribe to your MobileMe 
Gallery by clicking File➪Subscribe to Photo Feed and entering the sub-
scription URL.
 
✦ Folks using Windows or an older version of iPhoto: These subscribers 
can use any Web browser with RSS support (such as the Safari browser 
that comes with Snow Leopard and is available from Apple for Windows 
XP or Vista) or any RSS reader. (In effect, your MobileMe Gallery 
becomes an RSS feed for those without iPhoto ’09.)

Mailing Photos to Aunt Mildred
 
By default, any changes you make to the contents of your MobileMe Gallery 
are updated automatically on your MobileMe account, and, in turn, are 
updated automatically to everyone who receives your images. You can turn 
this feature off, however, if you have a large number of images and you 
update often (which can result in your sister’s computer downloading a lot 
of data). To display the Check for New Photos setting for MobileMe Gallery, 
click iPhoto➪Preferences and click the Web button on the Preferences 
window toolbar. (You can also change the title for your Gallery and monitor 
your iDisk usage from this pane.)
Mailing Photos to Aunt Mildred
iPhoto can help you send your images through e-mail by automating the pro-
cess. The application can prepare your image and embed it automatically in 
a new message.
To send an image through e-mail, select it and then click the Email button 
in the toolbar. The dialog, as shown in Figure 3-9, appears, allowing you to 
choose the size of the images and whether you want to include their titles, 
descriptions, and Places location information as well.
 
Keep in mind that most ISP (Internet service provider) e-mail servers don’t 
accept an e-mail message that’s more than 3MB or 4MB, so watch that Size dis-
play. If you’re trying to send a number of images and the size goes over 2MB, 
you might have to click the Size pop-up menu and choose a smaller size 
(reducing the image resolution) to get them all embedded in a single message.
 
Is that Facebook and Flickr I spy?
Indeed it is! iPhoto ’09 introduces a direct con-
nection to both your Facebook social network-
ing account (at www.facebook.com) and 
your Flickr online gallery account (at www.
flickr.com), allowing you to simply select 
one or more photos and send them automati-
cally to either service! These two buttons 
appear on the toolbar when you’re organizing 
your photos.
The first time you select photos in the Viewer 
(or an album or Event in the Source list) and 
click either button, iPhoto prompts you for per-
mission to set up your connection. (Of course, 
this will require you to enter your Facebook and 
Flickr account information — hence the confir-
mation request.) Click Set Up and provide the 
data that each site requires.
After you’ve set up your accounts, simply select 
your photos, albums, or Events and click the 
toolbar button for the desired service. Apple, 
you absolutely rock!

containing the images, ready for you to click Send!

✓ Putting text titles to work
✓ Sharing your movie with others
A
lfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, and Ridley Scott — 
those guys are amateurs! Welcome to the exciting world of moviemak-
ing on your Mac, where you call the shots. With iMovie, you can try your 
hand at all aspects of the movie-creating process, including editing and 
special effects. Built with ease-of-use in mind, iMovie lets you perform full-
blown movie production on your Macintosh with a minimum of effort.
Don’t let iMovie’s fancy buttons and flashing lights fool you: This applica-
tion is a feature-packed tool for serious movie production. The iMovie 
controls work the same as many top-notch, movie-editing tools that profes-
sionals use. From basic editing to audio and video effects, iMovie has every-
thing that you need to get started creating high-quality movies.
The iMovie Window
If you’ve ever tried a professional-level video editing application, you proba-
bly felt as though you were suddenly dropped in the cockpit of a jumbo jet. In 
iMovie, though, all the controls you need are easy to use and logically placed.
 
Video editing takes up quite a bit of desktop space. In fact, you can’t run 
iMovie at resolutions of less than 1024 x 768, nor would you want to.
To launch iMovie, click the iMovie icon in the Dock. (It looks like a star from 
the Hollywood Walk of Fame.) You can also click the Application folder in 
any Finder window sidebar and then double-click the iMovie icon.
To follow the examples I show you here, follow these strenuous steps and 
create a new movie project:

312
The iMovie Window
 
1. Click the File menu and choose New Project (or press Ô+N).
 
 iMovie displays the sheet you see in Figure 4-1.
 
2. Type a name for your project.
 
3. Select the aspect ratio (or screen dimensions) for your movie.
 
 You can select a widescreen display (16:9), a standard display (4:3), or 
a display especially suited for an iPhone (3:2). If compatibility with the 
familiar SDTV format is important, I always recommend that you choose 
standard (4:3) ratio; choosing 16:9 for an SDTV set will result in those 
familiar black “letterbox” bars at the top and bottom of the screen.
 
4. Click a thumbnail to select a theme to apply to your finished movie.
 
 If you choose a theme, iMovie automatically adds the transitions and 
titles that correspond to that theme. (Normally, this is what you want to 
do. However, if you want to add transitions and titles manually, click the 
Automatically Add Transitions and Titles check box to deselect it.)
 
 If you decide not to use a theme (by selecting the None thumbnail), iMovie 
can still add an automatic effect between clips. Click the Automatically Add 
check box and click the pop-up menu to choose the desired effect.
 
5. Click Create.
 
 You’re on your way! Check out Figure 4-2: This is the whole enchilada, in 
one window.

your media clips (video clips, photos, and audio) and the various tools 
that you use to make your film. The selected items fill the right side of 
the browser pane below the monitor.
 
✦ Event pane: All the video clips that you use to create your movie are 
stored in the Event pane. I show you what each of the panes in the iMovie 
workspace looks like when you tackle different tasks in this chapter.
 
✦ Project pane: iMovie displays the elements that you’ve added to your 
movie project in this pane.
 
✦ Playhead: The red vertical line that you see in the Event and Project 
panes is the playhead, which indicates the current editing point while 
you’re creating your movie. When you’re playing your movie, the play-
head moves to follow your progress through the movie.

A Bird’s-Eye View of Moviemaking

tions such as cropping, audio and video adjustments, voiceovers, and

✦ Camera Import window: Click this switch to import DV clips from your

Those are the major highlights of the iMovie window. A director’s chair and 
megaphone are optional, of course, but they do add to the mood.
A Bird’s-Eye View of Moviemaking
I don’t want to box in your creative skills here — after all, you can attack 
the moviemaking process from a number of angles. (Pun unfortunately 
intended.) However, I’ve found that my movies turn out the best when I 
follow a linear process, so before I dive into specifics, allow me to provide 
you with an overview of moviemaking with iMovie.
Here’s my take on the process, reduced to seven steps:
 
1. Import your video clips either directly from your DV camcorder, 
iSight camera, or your hard drive.
 
2. Drag your new selection of clips from the Event pane to the Project 
pane and arrange them in the desired order.
 
3. Import or record audio clips (from iTunes, GarageBand, or external 
sources, such as audio CDs or audio files, that you’ve recorded your-
self) and add them to your movie.
 
4. Import your photos (directly from iPhoto or from your hard drive) and 
place them where needed in your movie.
 
5. Add professional niceties, such as voiceovers, transitions, effects, and 
text to the project.
 
6. Preview your film and edit it further if necessary.
 
7. Share your finished film with others through the Web, e-mail, or a 
DVD that you create and burn with iDVD.
That’s the first step-by-step procedure in this chapter. I doubt that you’ll 
even need to refer back to it, however, because you’ll soon see just how easy 
it is to use iMovie.
 
As you might imagine, this chapter simply can’t hold a full description of 
every setting and every procedure within iMovie ’09 — but luckily, my good 
friend Dennis Cohen has done exactly that in his new book iMovie & iDVD 
’09 For Dummies (Wiley Publishing). Dennis will take you from basics to all 
the in-depth features of these two iLife applications!

Importing the Building Blocks
Importing the Building Blocks
Sure, you need video clips to create a movie of your own, but don’t panic if 
you have but a short supply. You can certainly turn to the other iLife appli-
cations for additional raw material. (See, I told you that integration thing 
would come in handy.)
Along with video clips you import from your DV camcorder, iSight camera, 
and hard drive, you can also call on iPhoto for still images (think credits) and 
iTunes for background audio and effects. In this section, I show you how.
Pulling in video clips
Your Mac is probably equipped already with the two extras that come in 
handy for video editing — namely, a large hard drive and a FireWire port. 
Because most mini-DV camcorders today use a FireWire connection to trans-
fer clips, you’re all set. (And even if your snazzy new DV camcorder uses a 
USB 2.0 connection, you’re still in the zone, although you may need to modify 
the steps I provide in this section for your particular device.) Oh, and if your 
Mac has an iSight camera on board, you’re a self-contained movie studio!
Here’s the drill if your clips are on your FireWire-equipped mini-DV camcorder:
 
1. Plug the proper cable into your Mac.
 
2. Set the DV camcorder to VTR (or VCR) mode.
 
 Some camcorders call this Play mode.
 
3. Click the Camera Import button (labeled in Figure 4-2).
 
 iMovie opens a new window.
 
4. Click the Camera pop-up menu (at the bottom of the Import window) 
and select your DV camcorder or iSight camera.
 
 Playback controls appear under the Camera Import window, mirroring 
the controls on your DV camcorder. This allows you to control the unit 
from iMovie. Keen! You also get Import All and Import Checked buttons 
as a bonus.
 
 To capture video from your iSight camera, click the Video Size pop-up 
menu to choose the dimensions of the clip; then click Capture. On the 
sheet that appears, choose the location where the video will be saved, 
and choose whether to add this video to an existing event or create a 
new event. Click Capture to start recording, and click Stop when your 
video is complete. (You can skip the rest of the steps in this section, 
which deal only with DV camcorders.)

5. To import selected clips from your DV camcorder, set the Automatic/
Manual switch to Manual.
 
 To import all clips, set the Automatic/Manual switch to Automatic, and 
click Import All.
 
6. Click the check boxes next to the clips that you don’t want to import 
to deselect them.
 
7. Click the Import Checked button.
 
8. Click the Save To pop-up menu and choose the drive that should store 
your clips.
 
 You can choose to add the new clips to an existing Event or create a 
new Event. Heck, if the event spanned more than one day, you can 
create a new Event for each day. (How do they think up these things?)
 
9. Click OK and admire your handiwork.
 
 iMovie begins transferring the footage to your Mac and automatically 
adds the imported clips to your Event Library.
 
If your clips are already on your hard drive, rest assured that iMovie can 
import them, including those in high-definition video (HDV) format. iMovie 
also recognizes a number of other video formats, as shown in Table 4-1.

To import a movie file, follow this bouncing ball:
 
1. Choose File➪Import and choose Movies from the submenu.
 
2. If you’re importing 1080i video clips, choose the quality setting.
 
 The Large setting will save you a significant amount of hard drive space, 
but the Full setting preserves the original resolution and detail. (If you’re 

Book III

not importing 1080i video, use the default Large setting and click OK. 
The Full setting demands all the CPU and RAM resources your Mac can 
offer, so don’t expect to do much else while importing.)
 
3. Click the drive that should store your clips in the sidebar and then 
navigate to the desired location.
 
4. Specify whether you want to add the imported video to an existing 
Event or create a new Event.
 
 If you choose to add the video to an existing Event, click the pop-up 
menu and select an Event.
 
5. Specify whether you want to copy the video (leaving the original 
movie intact) or whether the original movie should be deleted after a 
successful import.
 
6. Click Import.
 
 Alternatively, you can also drag a video clip from a Finder window and 
drop it in the Project pane.
Making use of still images
Still images come in handy as impressive-looking titles or as ending credits 
to your movie. (Make sure you list a gaffer and a best boy to be truly profes-
sional.) However, you can use still images also to introduce scenes or to 
separate clips according to your whim. For example, I use stills when delin-
eating the days of a vacation within a movie or different Christmas celebra-
tions over time.
Here are two methods of adding stills to your movie:
 
✦ Adding images from iPhoto: Click the Photo Browser button in the 
Browser toolbar (or press Ô+2) and you’ll experience the thrill that is 
your iPhoto Library, right from iMovie (as shown in Figure 4-3). You can 
elect to display your entire iPhoto Library or more selective picks such 
as specific albums or Events. When you find the image you want to add, 
just drag it to the right spot in the Project pane.
 
✦ Importing images from your hard drive: If you’re a member of the 
International Drag-and-Drop Society, you can drag TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PICT, 
PNG, and PSD images directly from a Finder window and drop them into 
the Project pane as well.

child’s play.
 
Importing and adding audio from all sorts of places
You can pull in everything from Wagner to Weezer as both background 
music and sound effects for your movie. In this section, I focus on how to get 
those notes into iMovie and then how to add them to your movie by drag-
ging them to the Project pane.
You can add audio from a number of sources:
 
✦ Adding songs from iTunes: Click the Show Music and Sound Effects 
button in the Browser toolbar (or press Ô+1) to display the contents of 
your iTunes Library. Click the desired playlist in the scrolling list box, 
such as the Dinah Washington playlist I selected in Figure 4-4. (If you’ve 
exported any original music you’ve composed in GarageBand to your 
iTunes Library, you can use those songs in your own movie!) You can 
add a track to your movie by dragging the song entry from the Music 
and Sound Effects list to the desired spot in the Project pane.

✦ Adding sound effects: Yep, if you need the sound of a horse gallop-
ing for your Rocky Mountain vacation clips, click either iMovie Sound 
Effects or iLife Sound Effects in the scrolling list box. iMovie includes a 
number of top-shelf audio effects that you can use in the second audio 
track on the timeline viewer. This way, you can add sound effects even 
when you’ve already added a background song. Again, to add a sound 
effect, drag it to the perfect spot in the Project pane.
 
 If you have several gigabytes of music in your iTunes Library, it might 
be more of a challenge to locate “Me and Bobby McGee” by Janis Joplin, 
especially if she’s included in a compilation. Let your Mac do the digging 
for you! Click in the Search box below the track list and begin typing a 
song name. iMovie narrows down the song titles displayed to those that 
match the characters you type. To reset the search box and display 
all your songs in the Library or selected playlist, click the X icon that 
appears to the right of the box.
 
✦ Ripping songs from an audio CD: Load an audio CD and then choose 
Audio CD from the scrolling list box. iMovie displays the tracks from the 
CD, and you can add them at the current playhead position the same 
way as iTunes songs.
 
✦ Recording directly from a microphone: Yep, if you’re thinking voi-
ceover narration, you’ve hit the nail on the head. Check out the sidebar, 
“Narration the easy way,” for the scoop.

320
Importing the Building Blocks
 
Narration the easy way
Ready to create that award-winning nature 
documentary? You can add voiceover narra-
tion to your iMovie project that would make 
Jacques Cousteau proud. In fact, you can 
record your voice while you watch your movie 
playing, allowing perfect synchronization with 
the action! To add narration, follow these 
steps:
 1. Click the Voiceover button in the Editing 
toolbar — it sports a microphone icon — 
to open the Voiceover window.
 2. Click the Record From pop-up menu and 
select the input device.
 
 Most Macs sport a decent internal micro-
phone, but you can always add a USB 
microphone to your system.
 3. Drag the input volume slider to a comfort-
able level.
 
 You can monitor the volume level of your 
voice with the left and right input meters — 
try to keep the meters at 50 percent or so 
for the proper volume level.
 4. To block out ambient noise levels around 
you, drag the Noise Reduction slider to the 
right if necessary.
 
 If you’d like iMovie to enhance your voice 
electronically for a more professional 
sound, click the Voice Enhancement check 
box to select it. If you need to hear the 
audio from your movie project while you 
speak, click the Play Project Audio While 
Recording check box to select it — note, 
however, that you’ll need to listen to the 
audio while using a set of headphones 
(plugged into your Mac’s headphone jack) 
to avoid feedback problems.
 5. Click in the desired spot within a clip in the 
Project pane where the narration should 
begin.
 6. Begin speaking when prompted by 
iMovie.
 7. Watch the video while you narrate so that 
you can coordinate your narration track 
with the action.
 8. Click anywhere in the iMovie window 
to stop recording (or wait until the clip 
ends).
 
 iMovie adds an icon to the Project pane 
underneath the video with the voiceover.
 9. Click the Close button in the Voiceover 
window.
 
You can fine-tune both the audio within a video clip or the audio clips that 
you add to your project. With the desired clip selected, click the Inspector 
button in the Editing toolbar (it bears a proud letter i) and click the Audio 
tab. The Audio Adjustments window that appears includes an array of audio 
controls that allow you to change the volume of the selected clip or to give 
that audio priority over other audio playing simultaneously (such as a sound 
effect that needs to be clearly heard over background music and the video 
clip). If your clips dramatically vary in volume, click the Normalize Clip 
Volume button and then select each clip that you want to set to the same 

Book III
Chapter 4

Building the Cinematic Basics
volume; click Normalize Clip Volume again for each clip. You can also set an 
automatic or manual Fade-in/Fade-out for the audio. When you’re done tweak-
ing, click Done. (Oh, and don’t forget that you can always return the clip to its 
original volume; just open this window again and click Revert to Original.)
Building the Cinematic Basics
Time to dive in and add the building blocks to create your movie. Along 
with video clips, audio tracks, and still images, you can add Hollywood-
quality transitions, optical effects, and animated text titles. In this section, 
I demonstrate how to elevate your collection of video clips into a real-life 
furshlugginer movie.
Adding clips to your movie
You can add clips to your movie by using the Project pane and the Event 
pane. The Dynamic Duo works like this:
 
✦ Project pane: This displays the media you’ve added to your project so 
far, allowing you to rearrange the clips, titles, transitions and still images 
in your movie.
 
✦ Event pane: This displays your video clips arranged by Event (the date 
they were shot or the date they were imported), acting as the source 
repository for all your clips. Movies pulled into iMovie, imported into 
iPhoto, or added manually from the Finder appear here.
To add a clip to your movie:
 
1. Move your mouse pointer across clips in the Event pane to watch a 
preview of the video.
 
2. When you’ve decided what to add to your project, you can either add 
the entire clip or a selection.
 
• To select an entire clip, right-click the clip’s thumbnail and choose 
Select Entire Clip from the menu that appears.
 
• To select a portion of a clip, drag your mouse cursor across the 
thumbnail. A yellow frame appears around your selection. To change 
the length of the selected video, drag the handles that appear on 
either side. If you make a mistake while selecting video, just click any 
empty space within the Event pane to remove the selection frame 
and try again.
 
3. Drag the selection from the Event pane to the spot where it belongs in 
the Project pane.
 
 Alternatively, you can press the E key or click the Add to Project button 
(the first button in the Editing toolbar).

322
Building the Cinematic Basics
Do this several times, and you have a movie, which you’ve created just as 
the editors of old used to by working with actual film clips. This is a good 
point to mention a moviemaking Mark’s Maxim:
Preview your work — and do it often.
iMovie offers two Play Full screen buttons: one under the Event Library 
and one under the Project Library. Select the project or Event you want to 
play and then click the corresponding button (or press Ô+G). You can also 
choose View➪Play Full Screen to watch the selection. Press the spacebar to 
pause, and press Esc to return to iMovie. You can also move your mouse to 
display a filmstrip that you can click to skip forward or backward in the 
project or Event.
To play a selection from the beginning, press \ (the slash that leans to the 
left). (If you’ve ever watched directors at work on today’s movie sets, you 
may have noticed that they’re constantly watching a monitor to see what 
things will look like for the audience. You have the same option in iMovie!)
 
While you’re watching video in the Event pane, you may decide that a cer-
tain clip has a favorite scene or that another clip has material you don’t 
want, such as Uncle Ed’s shadow puppets. (Shudder.) iMovie ’09 features 
Favorite and Rejected frames, allowing you to view and use your best camera 
work (and ignore the worst stuff). To mark video, select a range of frames or 
an entire clip and then click the Mark as Favorite button in the Editing tool-
bar. Click the Reject button to hide the selected video or frames from view. 
(You can always unmark a Favorite or Rejected scene using the Unmark 
button in the Editing toolbar.)
Removing clips from your movie
Don’t like a clip? Bah. To banish a clip from your movie, follow these steps
 
1. Click the offending clip in the Project pane to select it.
 
2. Press Delete.
 
 Alternatively, you can right-click the clip (or a selection you’ve made by 
dragging) and choose either Delete Entire Clip or Delete Selection from 
the menu that appears.
If you remove the wrong clip, don’t panic. Instead, use iMovie’s Undo feature 
(press Ô+Z) to restore it.
Reordering clips in your movie
 
If Day One of your vacation appears after Day Two, you can easily reorder 
your clips and stills by dragging them to the proper space in the Project 
pane. When you release the mouse, iMovie automatically moves the rest of 
your movie aside with a minimum of fuss and bother.

Building the Cinematic Basics
Editing clips in iMovie
If a clip has extra seconds of footage at the beginning or end, you don’t want 
that superfluous stuff in your masterpiece. Our favorite video editor gives 
you the following functions:
 
✦ Crop: Removes unwanted material from a video clip or still image, allow-
ing you to change the aspect ratio of the media
 
✦ Rotate: Rotates a clip or image on its center axis
 
✦ Trim: Trims frames from a video clip
Before you can edit, however, you have to select a section of a clip:
 
1. Click a clip or image in either the Project pane (where changes you 
make are specific to this project) or the Event pane (where edits you 
make are reflected in any project using that footage).
 
 iMovie displays the clip or image in the monitor.
 
2. To select the entire clip or image, simply click it.
 
3. Drag your mouse cursor across the thumbnail to select the section of 
the media you want to edit. (Note that some editing functions, such as 
Crop and Rotate, will automatically apply to the entire clip.)
 
 The selected region is surrounded by a yellow frame. You’re ready to 
edit that selected part of the clip.
 
Note the handles that appear at the beginning or ending of the selection. 
You can make fine changes to the selected section by dragging them.
 
✦ To crop: Click the Crop button in the Edit toolbar to display the frame 
in the Monitor pane and then click Crop at the top of the Monitor pane. 
Drag the edges of the frame and the handles to select the section you 
want to keep. To preview your selection, click the Play button at the top 
of the monitor. When you’re ready, click Done, and everything but the 
selected region is removed.
 
✦ To rotate: Click the Crop button in the Edit toolbar and then click one of 
the two rotation buttons (which carry a curved arrow icon). Each click 
rotates the media 90 degrees in that direction. Click Done when the clip 
or image is properly oriented.
 
✦ To trim: Choose Edit➪Trim to Selection. iMovie removes the frames 
from around the selected video.
 
Edits that you make to one clip or still image can actually be copied to multi-
ple items! Select the edited clip and click Edit➪Copy from the iMovie menu. 
Now you can select one or more clips and choose Edit➪Paste Adjustments 
to apply Video, Audio, or Crop edits. (To apply all three type of edits, just 
choose All.)

324
Building the Cinematic Basics
Transitions for the masses
Many iMovie owners approach transitions as visual bookends: They merely 
act as placeholders that appear between video clips. Nothing could be far-
ther from the truth, because judicious use of transitions can make or break a 
scene. For example, which would you prefer after a wedding ceremony — an 
abrupt, jarring cut to the reception or a gradual fadeout to the reception?
 
Today’s audiences are sensitive to transitions between scenes. Try not to over-
use the same transition. Also weigh the visual impact of a transition carefully.
iMovie includes a surprising array of transitions, including old favorites 
(such as Fade In and Dissolve) and some nifty stuff you might not be famil-
iar with (such as Cube and Page Curl). To display your transition collection 
(Figure 4-5), click the Show Transitions button on the Browser toolbar (or 
press Ô+4).
To see what a particular transition looks like, move your mouse pointer over 
the thumbnail to display the transition in miniature.
Adding a transition couldn’t be easier: Drag the transition from the list in the 
Transitions Browser pane and drop it between clips or between a clip and a still 
image in the Project pane. In iMovie ’09, transitions are applied in real time.

Even Gone with the Wind had titles
The last stop on our iMovie Hollywood Features Tour is the Titles Browser, 
shown in Figure 4-6. You’ll find it by clicking the Title button on the Browser 
toolbar (which bears a big capital T), or by pressing Ô+3. You can add a title 
with a still image, but iMovie also includes everything you need to add basic 
animated text to your movie.
Most of the controls you can adjust are the same for each animation style. 
You can change the font, the size of the text, and the color of the text.
To add a title manually:
 
1. Select an animation thumbnail from the Title Browser pane and drag 
it to the desired spot in the Project pane.
 
2. Click a background thumbnail to select a background for your title.
 
3. Click the Show Fonts button in the monitor window to make any 
changes to the fonts or text attributes.
 
4. Click in a text box to type your own line of text.

Sharing Your Finished Classic with Others
Your movie is complete, you’ve saved it to your hard drive, and now you’re 
wondering where to go from here. Click Share on the application menu bar, 
and you’ll see that iMovie can unleash your movie upon your unsuspecting 
family and friends (and even the entire world) in a number of ways:
 
✦ iTunes: Send your movie to your iTunes Library as a movie.
 
✦ Media Browser: Make your iMovie project available within other iLife 
’09 applications, in five different sizes suited to different display devices.
 
✦ YouTube: Yep, you read right, you can send your iMovie directly to the 
YouTube Web site! Can it get more convenient than that? (I think not.)
 
✦ MobileMe Gallery: Share your movie with the world at large by post-
ing it within a Gallery on your MobileMe Web site. (I provide more 
MobileMe details to chew on in Book V, Chapter 4.)
 
✦ Export Movie: Create a copy of your movie on your hard drive in one of 
five different sizes.
 
✦ Export using QuickTime: Create a QuickTime movie with your project 
using the QuickTime encoding engine (allowing greater control over the 
export process and the attributes of the finished movie file).
 
 If you use this option, any computer with an installed copy of QuickTime 
can display your movies, and you can use QuickTime movies in Keynote 
presentations as well.
 
✦ Export to Final Cut XML: If you’d like to transfer your iMovie ’09 project 
to Final Cut Pro, use this option to create a compatible XML file.
When you choose a sharing option, iMovie displays the video quality for the 
option and makes automatic changes to the movie attributes. (For example, 
choosing Tiny reduces the finished movie as far as possible in file size, and 
the audio is reduced to mono instead of stereo.)
 
Need to take a movie offline or stop sharing it? You can remove a project from 
iTunes, your iLife Media Browser, your MobileMe Web site, or the YouTube 
Web site from the Sharing menu as well. Just click the corresponding Remove 
menu item. (Of course, you can share the project again at any time.)

Sharing Your Finished Classic with Others
 
If you’re worried about permanently reducing the quality of your project by 
sharing it in a smaller size, fear not! When you choose a sharing option to 
export your movie, your original project remains on your hard drive, 
unchanged, so you can share a better-quality version at any time in the future!
After you adjust any settings specific to the desired sharing option, click 
Publish (or Save) to start the ball rolling.

A
 number of years ago, I bore witness to yet another proud moment in 
Apple history: the arrival of a powerful DVD recorder in an affordable 
computer. The SuperDrive was revolutionary because suddenly folks could 
create and view their own professional-quality DVDs.
Today the tradition continues: Apple includes iDVD free with today’s Macs 
as part of iLife Ú’09. With iDVD, you can easily create beautiful presenta-
tions with animation and interactive menus that anyone can watch in a stan-
dard DVD player or computer DVD drive. And that, friends and neighbors, is 
the quintessential definition of cool.
In this chapter, I show you the basics of creating your first home-cooked 
DVD movie — and you’ll even have fun doing it!
Introducing Your Mac to iDVD
Figure 5-1 shows iDVD in all its glory. You have to supply your own digital 
video clips, background audio, and digital photographs, of course.

Take a moment to appreciate iDVD — no secondary windows to fiddle with 
or silly palettes strung out everywhere. (Can you tell that I’ve had my fill of 
old-style DVD authoring applications?) Allow me to list the highlights of the 
iDVD window:
 
✦ Menu display: This section takes up the largest part of the iDVD 
window, with good reason. You create your project here. In this case, 
Menu refers to your DVD Menu, not the menu at the top of your Mac’s 
display.
 
✦ Media pane: You add video, still images, and audio to your project from 
here, as well as tweak and fine-tune things. The Media pane actually 
comprises three separate panes. To choose a new pane, click one of 
these buttons at the bottom of the screen:
 
• Themes: You apply themes (such as Travel Cards, Wedding White, 
and Baby Mobile) to your DVD Menu to give it a certain look and feel.

Introducing Your Mac to iDVD
 
• Buttons: These options apply to the item currently selected, such as 
drop shadows on your text titles or the appearance of your Menu 
buttons.
 
• Media: From here, you can add media items, such as video clips and 
photos, to your Menu.
 
✦ Add button: From this pop-up menu (which sports a dapper plus sign), 
you can choose one of three types of buttons to add to a project. The 
choices are
 
• Add Submenu: Choose this item to add a new submenu button to 
your DVD Menu. The person using your DVD Menu can click a button 
to display a new submenu that can include additional movies or 
slideshows. (If that sounds like ancient Greek, hang on. All becomes 
clearer later in the chapter, in the section “Adding movies.”)
 
 A Menu can hold only a maximum of 12 buttons (depending on the 
theme you choose), so submenus let you pack more content on your 
DVD. (Older versions of the application allowed only six buttons, so 
don’t feel too cheated.) Anyway, each submenu you create can hold 
another 12 buttons.
 
• Add Movie: Yep, this is the most popular button in the whole shooting 
match. Click this menu item to add a new movie clip to your Menu.
 
• Add Slideshow: If you want to add a slideshow to your DVD — say, 
using photos from your hard drive or pictures from your iPhoto 
library — click this menu item.
 
✦ Inspector button: Click this button to display the Inspector window for 
the current Menu or a highlighted object. From this window, you can 
change the look of an individual submenu button or an entire Menu.
 
✦ DVD Map: Click the Map button to display the organizational chart for 
your DVD Menu. Each button and submenu that you add to your top-
level DVD Menu is displayed here, and you can jump directly to a par-
ticular item by double-clicking it. Use this road map to help design the 
layout of your DVD Menu system or to get to a particular item quickly. 
To return to the Menu display, click the Map button again.
 
✦ Motion: Click this button to start or stop the animation cycle used with 
the current iDVD theme. The animation repeats (just as it will on your 
finished DVD) until you click the Motion button again.
 
 Need a visual indicator of the length of your Menu’s animation cycle? 
Click View➪Show Motion Playhead to display the animation playhead, 
which moves below the Menu display to indicate where you are in the 
animation cycle. As you can with other playheads in the iLife suite, you 
can click and drag the diamond-shaped playhead button to move any-
where in the animation cycle.

Starting a New DVD Project
 
✦ Edit Drop Zones: This button allows you to edit the look and contents 
of a drop zone on your Menu. (Don’t worry, I explain more about drop 
zones in the sidebar titled, “Taking advantage of drop zones,” later in 
this chapter.)
 
✦ Preview: To see how your DVD Menu project looks when burned to a 
DVD, click Preview. You get a truly nifty on-screen remote control that 
you can use to navigate your DVD Menu, just as if you were watching 
your DVD on a standard DVD player. To exit Preview mode, click the 
Stop button on the remote control. 
 
✦ Burn: Oh, yeah, you know what this one is for — recording your com-
pleted DVD movie to a blank disc.
That’s the lot! Time to get down to the step-by-step business of making 
movies.
Starting a New DVD Project
When you launch iDVD for the first time (or if you close all iDVD windows), 
you get the sporty dialog shown in Figure 5-2. Take a moment to discover 
more about these four choices.

Creating a new project
If you choose Create a New Project, iDVD prompts you to type a name for 
your new DVD project and to set a location where the project files should be 
saved. By default, the very reasonable choice is your Documents folder. You 
also get to choose whether your project will display in a Standard

(full-screen) aspect ratio of 4:3 or a Widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9. If you’ve 
been watching DVD movies for some time, you recognize these two terms.
 
You’ll probably crave Widescreen format if you have a widescreen TV — go 
figure — but both formats will display on both types of televisions, complete 
with those black bars we all know and love at the top and bottom (or left 
and right sides) of the screen.
Click Create, and the iDVD window appears in all its glory.
Opening an existing project
If you’ve used iDVD and had a DVD project open the last time you quit the 
application, iDVD automatically loads the DVD project you were working on. 
However, you can open any DVD you’ve created by clicking Open an Existing 
Project. (To choose a different existing project from the iDVD window, press 
Ô+O or choose File➪Open Recent.)
Automating the whole darn process
If you’re a fan of click-it-and-forget-it (or are in a hurry), you can throw cau-
tion to the wind and allow iDVD to create your latest epic for you! iDVD 
offers two automated methods of creating a DVD movie disc. 
Using OneStep DVD
With OneStep, iDVD does almost all of the work automatically, by using the 
media clips and photos that you specify. To allow iDVD to help you create 
a movie, click the OneStep DVD button on the top-level menu (refer back to 
Figure 5-2). If you’ve already opened a project, choose File➪OneStep DVD 
from the application’s menu bar (to import clips directly from your FireWire 
mini-DV camera) or OneStep DVD from Movie (to select a clip to import from 
your hard drive). I tell you more about the OneStep DVD feature later, in the 
section “A Word about Automation.”
Using Magic iDVD
Magic iDVD is the newcomer on the block, and it falls neatly between total 
automation (with OneStep DVD) and total manual control. Click the Magic 
iDVD button on the top-level menu (as shown in Figure 5-2). If you’ve already 
opened a project, you can choose File➪Magic iDVD from the menu bar to 
choose a theme, drop specific movies and specific photos into filmstrips, 
and choose an audio track.
In contrast to OneStep DVD, you get to preview the finished product. If it’s to 
your liking, you can choose to either burn the disc directly or create a full-
blown iDVD project with the results. Sweet.
You find out more about the new Magic iDVD feature later, in the section “A 
Word about Automation.”

Creating a DVD from Scratch
Creating a DVD from Scratch
Doing things the old-fashioned, creative, and manual way (following the 
examples in this section) involves four basic steps:
 
1. Design the DVD Menu.
 
 Choose a theme and any necessary buttons or links.
 
2. Add media.
 
 You can drag movie files from iMovie, still images from iPhoto, and 
music from iTunes.
 
3. Tweak.
 
 Adjust and fine-tune your DVD Menu settings.
 
4. Finish things up.
 
 Preview and burn your DVD, or save it to your hard drive.
Choosing just the right theme
The first step to take when manually designing a new DVD Menu system is 
to add a theme. In the iDVD world, a theme is a preset package that helps 
determine the appearance and visual appeal of your DVD Menu, including a 
background image, Menu animation, an audio track, and a group of settings 
for text fonts and button styles.
iDVD helps those of us who are graphically challenged by including a wide 
range of professionally designed themes for all sorts of occasions, rang-
ing from old standbys such as weddings, birthdays, and vacations to more 
generic themes with the accent on action, friendship, and technology. To 
view the included themes, click the Themes button in the lower-right corner 
of the iDVD window (see Figure 5-3).
To choose a theme for your project — or to see what a theme looks like on 
your Menu — click any thumbnail and watch iDVD update the Menu display.
 
If you decide while creating your DVD Menu that you need a different theme, 
you can change themes at any time. iDVD won’t lose a single button or video 
clip that you add to your DVD Menu. You’ll be amazed at how the look and 
sound of your DVD Menu completely change with just the click of a theme 
thumbnail.

Adding movies
Drop zones and themes are cool, but most folks want to add video to their 
DVD. To accomplish this, iDVD uses buttons as links to your video clips. In 
fact, some iDVD Movie buttons display a preview of the video they’ll display! 
To play the video on a DVD player, you select the Movie button with the 
remote control, just as you do for a commercial DVD.
To add a Movie button, drag a QuickTime movie file from the Finder and 
drop it onto your DVD Menu display. (Only MPEG-4 QuickTime movies 
and DV streams are supported — MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 movie clips may be 
rejected or converted.) Alternatively, click the Add button and choose Add 
Movie from the pop-up menu.
 
iDVD and iMovie are soul mates, so you can also display the iDVD Media 
pane and then click Movies from the pop-up menu. Now you can drag clips 
from your Movies folder.

336
Creating a DVD from Scratch
 
Taking advantage of drop zones
Most of Apple’s animated themes include spe-
cial bordered areas marked as drop zones. 
These locations have nothing to do with skydiv-
ing; rather, a drop zone is a placeholder in the 
Menu that can hold a single video clip or photo-
graph. When you drag a video clip or an image 
to a drop zone, that clip or picture is added to 
the animation in Apple’s theme! Think about 
that for a moment; I know I did. You can actually 
personalize a Hollywood-quality animated DVD 
menu with your own photos and video!
Most of the themes included with iDVD include 
at least one drop zone, and some are practically 
jam-packed with drop zones. For example, the 
amazing Forever theme has a whopping six 
drop zones! If you think a Menu looks just fine 
without anything in a drop zone, however, you 
don’t have to put anything there. The words 
Drop Zone disappear when you preview or burn 
your DVD. (Empty frames do tend to look a bit 
silly in some themes, though.)
To add a video clip or image to a drop zone, 
simply drag the clip or photo from a Finder 
window and drop it on the desired drop zone. 
You can also drag clips or photos from other 
sources, including the Movies and Photos 
panes in iDVD’s Media pane, the iMovie 
window, or the iPhoto window. (Remember, 
Apple is anything but strict on these matters.) 
Remember, drop zones don’t act as links or 
buttons to other content; the stuff you add to 
a Menu’s drop zones appears only as part of 
the theme’s animation cycle. You can even drag 
an iPhoto event or album to a drop zone, and 
it will continuously cycle through the images. 
Wowsers!
To see all the drop zones at one time (without 
cycling through the animation), click the Edit 
Drop Zones button at the bottom center of the 
iDVD window; when you do, you see a thumb-
nail display of each zone. You can drag items 
to these thumbnails or jump right to one in the 
animation by clicking the thumbnail. To delete 
the contents of a drop zone, click the thumbnail 
in the editor and press the Delete key.
If you’re adding something to a dynamic drop 
zone (which disappears and reappears during 
the menu animation cycle), click the Motion 
button to activate the animation and then click 
it again to stop the animation cycle. Now click 
and drag the scrubber bar until the desired drop 
zone is in view. To delete the contents of a drop 
zone, Control-click (or right-click) the drop zone 
and choose Clear.
No matter the source of the clip, when you drop it onto your DVD Menu, 
iDVD adds a Movie button, as you can see in Figure 5-4. Note that some but-
tons appear as text links rather than actual buttons. The appearance of a 
Movie button in your DVD Menu is determined by the theme you choose.
 
A Movie button doesn’t have to stay where iDVD places it! By default, iDVD 
aligns buttons and text objects using an invisible grid, but if you don’t want 
such order imposed on your creativity, just drag the object to where you’d 
like it to be to turn on Free Positioning. (You can also right-click the object 
and select the Free Positioning item from the menu that appears.) iDVD even 
provides cool new automatic guides that help you align objects when you’re 
using Free Positioning! You’ll see them as yellow lines that appear when 
objects are aligned along a vertical or horizontal plane.

Figure 5-4:
A new 
Movie 
button 
appears on 
your pristine 
DVD Menu.
 
You can have up to 12 buttons on your iDVD Menu (the theme you choose 
determines the maximum number of buttons you can add). To add more 
content than 12 buttons allow, add a submenu by clicking the Add button 
and choosing Add Submenu from the pop-up menu. Now you can click the 
submenu button to jump to that screen and drag up to another 12 movie 
files into it.
 
Keep your target audience in mind while you create your DVD. Standard TV 
sets have a different aspect ratio (height to width) and resolution (number 
of scan lines on the screen) than a digital video clip, and a standard TV isn’t 
as precise in focusing that image on the tube. If you selected the Standard 
aspect ratio when you created the project, you can make sure that your DVD 
content looks great on a standard TV screen by following these steps:
 
1. Click View on the old-fashioned iDVD menu (the one at the top of the 
screen).
 
2. Choose the Show TV Safe Area command.
 
 You can also press the convenient Ô+T shortcut. iDVD adds a smaller 
rectangle within the iDVD window to mark the screen dimensions of a 
standard TV.

338
Creating a DVD from Scratch
 
A word on image dimensions
For best playback results on a standard TV, make 
sure that your background image has the same 
dimensions as standard digital video — 640 x 
480 pixels. If the dimensions of your image don’t 
match the dimensions of digital video, iDVD will 
stretch or shrink the image to fit, which might 
have undesirable effects. When your image is 
stretched and skewed to fit the DVD Menu, Aunt 
Harriet might end up looking like Shrek.
You can use QuickTime player or iPhoto to 
change the dimensions of your background 
image for import into iDVD. For example, you 
can use the iPhoto crop feature to alter the 
overall shape of the image and then resize it 
within iPhoto. Use the Size setting when you 
export the image from iPhoto and then save 
the file in the Pictures folder located in your 
Home folder so that you can find it easily later. 
(For more on working in iPhoto, see Book III, 
Chapter 3.)
If you enjoy a cutting-edge widescreen (16:9) 
or HD (high-definition) TV display, you won’t 
have the standard TV dimension restriction 
of 640 x 480 pixels. And because iDVD sup-
ports HD video and 16:9 video with a number 
of widescreen themes, be prepared to kiss the 
phrases pan-and-scan and full-screen goodbye 
and forget about the Show TV Safe Area fea-
ture. If your completed DVD projects are purely 
for your own enjoyment, that’s a great idea. 
However, don’t forget that if you distribute your 
discs to others with old-fashioned TVs dating 
back to the archaic ’80s and ’90s, they might not 
be pleased with what they see!
If you take care that your Menu buttons and (most of) your background 
image fit within this smaller rectangle, you’re assured that folks with a stan-
dard television can enjoy your work. To turn off the TV Safe Area rectangle, 
press Ô+T again.
If your entire family is blessed with a fleet of HD TVs (or you chose the 
Widescreen aspect ratio for this project), leave the Show TV Safe Area option 
off. Today’s widescreen displays can handle just about any orientation.
Great, now my audience demands a slideshow
Many Mac owners don’t realize that iDVD can use not only video clips but 
also digital photos as content. In fact, you can add a group of images to your 
DVD Menu by using Slideshow buttons, which allow the viewer to play back 
a series of digital photographs. iDVD handles everything for you, so there’s 
no tricky timing to figure out or weird scripts to write. Just click the Add 
button at the bottom of the iDVD window and choose Add Slideshow. iDVD 
places a Slideshow button on your DVD Menu.
After the Slideshow button is on tap, add the content — in this case, by 
choosing the images that iDVD adds to your DVD Menu. Follow these steps 
to select your slideshow images:

1. Double-click the Slideshow Menu button — the one you just added to 
the Menu — to open the Slideshow display (see Figure 5-5).
 
2. Click the Media button (bottom right of the screen).
 
3. Click the Photos tab (top right of the screen) to display your iPhoto 
library and photo albums.
 
4. Drag your favorite image thumbnails from the Photos list and drop 
them into the My Slideshow window.
 
 You can also drag images straight from a Finder window or the iPhoto 
window itself. (Those Apple folks are sooooo predictable.)
 
5. Drag around the photos in the My Slideshow window to set their order 
of appearance in your slideshow.
 
6. To add audio to these pictures, drag your favorite audio file from the 
Finder and drop it in the Audio well in the My Slideshow window.
 
 The Audio well is the box bearing the speaker icon, next to the volume 
control below the My Slideshow window.
 
 Alternatively, click the Audio button to select an audio track from your 
iTunes library, iTunes playlists, or GarageBand creations.
 
7. Click the Return button to return to your DVD Menu.

If you’re using a Menu with animated buttons that display an image (rather 
than text buttons), you can choose which image you want to appear on the 
Slideshow button. Click the Slideshow button that you added and see the 
slider that appears above the Slideshow button. Drag this slider to scroll 
through the images you added. When you find the image that you want to 
use for the Slideshow button in the DVD Menu, click the Slideshow button 
again to save your changes.
Now for the music . . .
Most of the Apple-supplied themes already have their own background 
music, so you might not even need to add music to your DVD Menu. 
However, if you want to change the existing background music (or if your 
DVD Menu currently doesn’t have any music), adding your own audio to the 
current Menu is child’s play!
 
1. Click the Media button.
 
2. Click the Audio tab to reveal the musical Shangri-La, as shown 
in Figure 5-6. 
 
3. Drag an audio file from the iTunes playlist or GarageBand folder dis-
play and drop it on the Menu background.
 
 iDVD accepts every sound format that you can use for importing encod-
ing in iTunes: AIFF, MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, and WAV audio files.

Giving Your DVD the Personal Touch
You can easily make changes to the default settings provided with the 
theme you chose. iDVD offers all sorts of controls that allow you to change 
the appearance and behavior of buttons, text, and the presentation of your 
content. In this section, I show you how to cast out iDVD’s (perfectly good) 
defaults and then tweak things to perfection.
Using Uncle Morty for your DVD Menu background
Hey, Uncle Morty might not be a supermodel, but he has birthdays and anni-
versaries, and iDVD is more than happy to accommodate you in document-
ing those milestones! Follow these steps to change the background of your 
DVD Menu:
 
1. Click the Inspector button.
 
2. Get an image using one of the following methods:
 
• Drag an image from the Finder and drop it into the Background well.
 
• Drag the image directly into the Menu display.
 
• To use an image from your iPhoto library, click the Media button and 
click the Photos tab, and then drag the desired image into the Menu 
display.
 
 iDVD updates the DVD Menu to reflect your new background choice.
Adding your own titles
The one tweak you’ll probably have to perform in every iDVD project is 
changing titles. Unfortunately, the default labels provided by iDVD are pretty 
lame, and they appear in two important places:
 
✦ Menu title: Your large main title usually appears at the top of the DVD 
Menu.
 
✦ Button captions: Each Submenu, Movie, and Slideshow button that you 
add to your Menu has its own title.

342
Giving Your DVD the Personal Touch
To change the text in your Menu title or the titles below your buttons, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select the text by clicking it.
 
2. Click it again to edit it.
 
 A rectangle with a cursor appears to indicate that you can now edit the text.
 
3. Type the new text and press Return to save the change.

nail picture for that button in your DVD Menu. (Naturally, this is only for 
animated buttons, not text buttons.)
 
 Enable the Movie check box to animate the button.
 
3. To create a Movie button with a still image, drag a picture from a 
Finder window or the Media pane and drop it on top of the button.

Previewing Your Masterpiece
Give my creation motion!
Earlier in this chapter, you find out how to use a different image for your 
background, but what about using an animated background? You can use 
any QuickTime movie from your iMovie library to animate your DVD Menu 
background! Didn’t I tell you that this iDVD thing was huge?
 
Keep in mind that your background movie should be a short clip; 20–30 sec-
onds is optimal. A clip with a fade-in at the beginning and a fade-out at the 
end is the best choice because iDVD loops your background clip continu-
ously, and your animated background flows seamlessly behind your Menu.
 
I’m not talking drop zones here. (See the sidebar “Taking advantage of drop 
zones,” earlier in this chapter, for an explanation of drop zones.) You can 
add a movie to a drop zone, of course, but by using a movie clip as a back-
ground, you’re replacing the entire animation sequence rather than just a 
single area of the background. Drop zones also don’t provide audio, whereas 
a clip background does include the clip audio.
Follow these steps to add a new animated background:
 
1. Click your old friend, the Inspector button.
 
 Make sure that no individual objects are highlighted so that the 
Inspector window displays the Menu properties instead.
 
2. Drag a movie from the Finder and drop it into the Background well.
 
 You can click the Movies tab in the Media pane to instantly display your 
iMovie collection.
 
3. Click the Motion button in the iDVD window to try out your new back-
ground.
 
4. Click the Motion button again to stop the animation cycle.
Previewing Your Masterpiece
Figure 5-7 captures the elusive Preview remote control — truly an awesome 
sight. When you click Preview, the Media pane disappears, and your DVD 
Menu appears exactly as it will on the finished DVD.
Ah, but appearances aren’t everything: You can also use your DVD Menu! 
Click the buttons on the remote control to simulate the remote on your DVD 
player, or think outside the box and click a Menu button directly with your 
mouse pointer. iDVD presents the video clip, runs the slideshow, or jumps to 
a submenu, just as it will with the completed disc.

This is a great time to test-drive a project before you burn it to disc. To 
make sure you don’t waste a blank DVD, make certain that everything you 
expect to happen actually happens. Nothing worse than discovering that 
Aunt Edna’s slideshow from her Hong Kong trip actually displays your fam-
ily’s summer trip to the zoo (whoops). If you made a mistake or something 
needs tweaking, click the Preview button again, and you’re back to the iDVD 
window proper, where you can edit or fine-tune your project.
 
iDVD allows you to save your project as a standard Mac OS X disc image 
rather than as a simple project file (or a physical DVD) — a good idea for 
those Macs without a SuperDrive on board because you can use Apple’s Disk 
Utility to open and mount the disc image as if it were a burned disc. If you 
move the disc image to another Mac with a SuperDrive, you can use Disk 
Utility to burn it on that machine. To save an iDVD project as a disc image, 
choose File➪Save as Disc Image (or press Ô+Shift+R).
 
Interested in tweaking settings across your entire project? Perhaps you’d 
like to reduce the time it takes to create and edit your DVD, or you’d like to 
switch video modes from NTSC to PAL for a DVD that’s to be sent overseas. 
If you’d like to view or change the overall settings for your entire DVD, click 
Project➪Project Info to display the Project Info dialog. Heck, you can even 
switch aspect ratios, or change the project name. . . . Thanks, Apple!

A Word about Automation
A Word about Automation
At the beginning of the chapter, I mention the easy way to produce an iDVD 
disc or project, using either OneStep DVD (for complete automation) or Magic 
iDVD (for partial automation). In this section, I provide you with the details.
One-click paradise with OneStep DVD
If you’re in a hurry to create a DVD from clips on your DV camcorder and 
you don’t mind losing your creative input, OneStep DVD is just the ticket. 
In short, iDVD allows you to plug in your FireWire-equipped mini-DV cam-
corder, answer a question or two, and then sit back while the application 
does all the work. iDVD imports the DV clips, creates a basic Menu design, 
and burns the disc automatically!
Using OneStep DVD will appeal to any laptop owner with a SuperDrive. Why 
not produce a DVD right after a wedding or birthday that you can give as a 
gift? Photographers who cover those same special events might consider 
selling a DVD made with OneStep DVD. If you happen to capture something 
incredibly unique — such as a UFO landing or an honest politician — you 
can use OneStep DVD to create an instant backup of the clips on your DV 
camcorder. You could even keep your friends and family up-to-date with 
the progress of your vacation by sending them a daily DVD of your exploits! 
(You gotta admit, even Grandma would consider that eminently sassy!)
Follow these steps to start the OneStep DVD process:
 
1. Click the OneStep DVD button on the iDVD top-level menu (refer 
to Figure 5-2).
 
 Alternatively, choose File➪OneStep DVD. 
 
 iDVD displays the dialog shown in Figure 5-8.
 
Figure 5-8: 
Connect 
your DV 
camcorder, 
and 
OneStep

346
A Word about Automation
 
 If you want to use OneStep DVD with an existing movie on your Mac’s 
hard drive, choose File➪OneStep DVD from Movie instead. iDVD 
prompts you for the video file to use.
 
2. Following the prompts, connect the FireWire cable from your DV cam-
corder; then turn on the camcorder and set it to VCR mode.
 
3. Click OK.
 
4. Load a blank DVD.
Exercising control with Magic iDVD
Got a little extra time? For those who prefer to make just a few choices and 
let iDVD do the rest, the new Magic iDVD feature just plain rocks! However, 
you can’t import clips directly from your mini-DV camcorder as you can with 
OneStep DVD; instead, you select one of the following:
 
✦ An iDVD theme
 
✦ Video clips you’ve already created with iMovie or dragged from the 
Finder (perfect for use with a USB 2.0 DV camcorder)
 
✦ Photos from your iPhoto library or dragged from the Finder
 
✦ Audio from your iTunes playlist or dragged from the Finder
Follow these steps to start the OneStep DVD process:
 
1. Click the Magic iDVD button on the iDVD top-level dialog (refer 
to Figure 5-2).
 
 iDVD displays the window you see in Figure 5-9.
 
2. Click in the DVD Title box and type a name for your disc (or project).
 
3. Click to select a theme from the Theme strip.
 
4. Click the Movies tab and drag the desired clips into the Drop Movies 
Here strip.
 
5. To add a slideshow, click the Photos tab and drag the desired photos 
into the Drop Photos Here strip.
 
6. To add audio for your slideshow, click the Audio tab and drag the 
desired song into the Drop Photos Here strip (a speaker icon appears in 
the first cell of the strip to indicate that you’ve added a soundtrack).
 
7. Click Preview to see a preview of the finished project, complete with 
remote control. To exit Preview mode, click Exit.

 I have to admit, the Burn button that appears has to be my favorite 
single control in all my 20+ years of computing! It looks powerful, it looks 
sexy . . . it wants to burn. (Sorry about that.)
 
2. After iDVD asks you to insert a blank DVD-R into the SuperDrive, load 
a single or dual-layer blank DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, or DVD+RW 
(depending on the media your Mac can handle).

348
Recording a Finished Project to a Shiny Disc
 
 Your SuperDrive might be able to burn and read a DVD+R, DVD-RW, or 
DVD+RW, but what about your DVD player? Keep in mind that only 
DVD-Rs are likely to work in older DVD players. The latest generation of 
DVD players is likely DVD+R compatible as well, but I’ve seen only a 
handful of DVD players that can handle rewriteable media at the time of 
this writing. Therefore, remember the destination for the discs you burn 
and choose your media accordingly.
 
 After a short pause, iDVD begins burning the DVD. The application keeps 
you updated with a progress bar.
When the disc is finished, you’re ready to load it into your favorite local DVD 
player, or you can load it back into your Mac and enjoy your work using 
Apple’s DVD Player.
Either way, it’s all good!

✓ Building arrangements
✓ Adding effects to instruments
✓ Exporting your work to iTunes and iWeb

W
hen I was a kid, I always thought that real rock stars trashed their 
instruments after a hard night’s worth of jamming — you know, like 
The Who, Led Zeppelin, KISS, and the Rolling Stones. Guitars got set on fire, 
or pounded into the stage, or thrown into the crowd like beads during a 
Mardi Gras parade.
I can make my own music now, but you’ll never see me trash my instrument! 
I compose music on my Mac with GarageBand, Apple’s music-making com-
ponent in the iLife application suite. You can solo on all sorts of instruments, 
and even add horns, drums, and a funky bass line for backup . . . all with abso-
lutely no musical experience (and, in my case, very little talent, to boot)!
Oh, and did I mention that GarageBand ’09 also produces podcasts? That’s 
right, you can record your voice and easily create your own show, and then 
share it with others from your iWeb site! Heck, add photos if you like. You’ll 
be the talk of your family and friends and maybe even your Mac user group.
This chapter explains everything you need to know to create your first song 
(or your first podcast). I also show you how to import your hit record into 
iTunes so that you can listen to it on your iPod with a big, silly grin on your 
face (as I do) or add it to your next iMovie or iDVD project as a royalty-free 
soundtrack.

✦ Track list: In GarageBand, a track is a discrete instrument that you set 
up to play one part of your song. For example, a track in a classical piece 
for string quartet would have four tracks — one each for violin, viola, 
cello, and bass. This list contains all the tracks in your song arranged so 
that you can easily see and modify them, like the rows in a spreadsheet.

Shaking Hands with Your Band
A track begins in the list, stretching out to the right all the way to the 
end of the song. As you can see in the upper left of Figure 6-1, I already 
have one track defined — a Grand Piano.
 
 If you’re creating a podcast, a Podcast artwork track can also appear.
 
✦ Timeline: This scrolling area holds the loops (see the following bullet) 
that you add or record, allowing you to move and edit them easily. 
When a song plays, the Timeline scrolls to give you a visual look at your 
music. (Bear with me; you’ll understand that cryptic statement in a page 
or two.)
 
✦ Loop: This is a prerecorded clip of an instrument being played in a spe-
cific style and tempo. Loops are the building blocks of your song. You 
can drag loops from the Loop Browser to a track and literally build a 
bass line or a guitar solo. (It’s a little like adding video clips in iMovie to 
build a film.)
 
✦ Playhead: This vertical line is a moving indicator that shows you the 
current position in your song while it scrolls by in the Timeline. You can 
drag the playhead to a new location at any time. The playhead also acts 
like the insertion cursor in a word processing application: If you insert a 
section of a song or a loop from the Clipboard, it appears at the current 
location of the playhead. (More on copying and inserting loops later, so 
don’t panic.)
 
✦ Create a New Track button: Click this button to add a new track to 
your song.
 
✦ Track Info button: If you need to display the instrument used in a track, 
click the track to select it and then click this button. You can also con-
trol settings, such as Echo and Reverb, from the Edit pane of the Track 
Info display.
 
✦ View/Hide Loop Browser button: Click the button with the striking eye 
icon to display the Loop Browser at the bottom of the window; click 
it again to close it. You can see more of your tracks at a time without 
scrolling by closing the Loop Browser.
 
✦ View/Hide Media Browser button: Click this button (which bears icons 
of a filmstrip, slide, and musical note) to display the media browser 
at the right side of the window; click it again to close it. By closing the 
media browser, you’ll see more of your tracks. If you’re already familiar 
with iDVD, iWeb, or iMovie, you recognize this pane in the GarageBand 
window; it allows you to add media (in this case, digital song files, still 
images, or video clips) to your GarageBand project for use in a podcast.
 
✦ Return to Beginning button: Clicking this button immediately moves 
the playhead back to the beginning of the Timeline.
 
✦ Move Back/Forward One Measure buttons: To move quickly through 
your song by jumping to the previous or next measure, click the corre-
sponding button.

✦ Play button: Hey, old friend! At last, a control that you’ve probably used 
countless times before — and it works just like the same control on your 
audio CD player. Click Play, and GarageBand begins playing your entire 
song. Notice that the Play button turns blue. To stop the music, click 
Play again; the button loses that sexy blue sheen and the playhead stops 
immediately. (If playback is paused, it begins again at the playhead posi-
tion when you click Play.)
 
✦ Time/Tempo display: This cool-looking LCD display shows you the 
current playhead position in seconds.
 
 You can click the icon at the left of the display to choose other modes, 
such as 
 
• Measures (to display the current measure and mark the beat) 
 
• Chord (to display note and chord names) 
 
• Project (to show or change the key, tempo and signature for the song).
 
✦ Volume slider: Here’s another familiar face. Just drag the slider to raise 
or lower the volume.
Of course, more controls are scattered around the GarageBand window, but 
these are the main controls used to compose a song . . . which is the next stop!
Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
In this section, I cover the basics of composition in GarageBand, working 
from the very beginning. Follow along with this running example:
 
1. Close all existing GarageBand windows.
 
 GarageBand displays the top-level New Project dialog.
 
2. Click New Project on the list at the left.
 
3. Click the Piano icon and click Choose.
 
 GarageBand displays the New Project dialog, as shown in Figure 6-2.
 
 By choosing the Piano, my new GarageBand project will have one track 
already in place — a grand piano. If you choose Electric Guitar or Voice, 
you’ll have a project automatically created with an electric guitar track 
or male and female voice tracks. To create a completely empty project, 
choose Loops.
 
4. Type a name for your new song and then drag the Tempo slider to 
select the beats per minute (bpm).
 
 A GarageBand song can have only one tempo (or speed) throughout, 
expressed as beats per minute.

5. If you want to adjust the settings for your song, you can select the
 
• Time signature (the Time box)
 
• Key (the Key box)
 
 If you’re new to music theory (the rules and syntax by which music is 
created and written), just use the defaults. Most of the toe-tappin’ tunes 
that you and I are familiar with fit right in with these settings.
 
6. Click the Create button.
 
 You see the window shown in Figure 6-1. (The Blue Jazz Piano 01 
section at the top of Figure 6-1 — which I show you how to add in the 
next section — is an example of a typical loop.)
Adding tracks
Although I’m not a musician, I am a music lover, and I know that many clas-
sical composers approached a new work in the same way you approach a 
new song in GarageBand: by envisioning the instruments that they wanted 
to hear. (I imagine Mozart and Beethoven would’ve been thrilled to use 
GarageBand, but I think they did a decent job with pen and paper, too.)
In fact, GarageBand ’09 introduces a Songwriting project (also available from 
the top-level New Project dialog). When you choose the Songwriting project, 
GarageBand presents you with a full set of four instrument tracks, plus a real 
instrument track for your voice. (More on software versus real instrument 
tracks in a page or two.) You’re instantly ready to start adding loops and 
recording your own voice!

354
Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
 
If you’ve followed along to this point, you’ve noticed two problems with your 
GarageBand window:
 
✦ There’s no keyboard. You can record the contents of a software instru-
ment track by “playing” the keyboard, clicking the keys with your 
mouse. (As you might imagine, this isn’t the best solution.) If you’re a 
musician, the best method of recording your own notes is with a MIDI 
instrument, which I discuss later in the chapter. For now, you can dis-
play the keyboard window by pressing Ô+K. If the keyboard window is 
on the screen and you don’t need it, banish the window by clicking the 
Close button.
 
 Even if you’re not interested in the “point-and-click” keyboard, 
GarageBand offers a musical typing keyboard, where you press the keys 
on your keyboard to simulate the keys on a musical keyboard. (Hey, if 
you don’t have a MIDI instrument, at least it’s better than nothing.) To 
display the musical typing keyboard window, press Shift+Ô+K.
 
✦ The example song has only one track. If you want to write the next 
classical masterpiece for Grand Piano, that’s fine. Otherwise, on the 
GarageBand menu bar, choose Track➪Delete Track to start with a clean 
slate. (I know, I could have started with a Loops project, but this way 
you get to see how to delete a track.)
 
These are the five kinds of tracks you can use in GarageBand ’09:
 
✦ Software instrument tracks: These tracks aren’t audio recordings. 
Rather, they’re mathematically precise algorithms that your Mac renders 
(or builds) to fit your needs. If you have a MIDI instrument connected to 
your Mac, you can create your own software instrument tracks. (More 
on MIDI instruments later in this chapter.)
 
 In this chapter, I focus on software instrument tracks, which are the 
easiest for a nonmusician to use.
 
✦ Real instrument tracks: A real instrument track is an actual audio 
recording, such as your voice or a physical instrument without a MIDI 
connection. (Think microphone.)
 
✦ Electric Guitar tracks: GarageBand includes a real instrument track 
especially made for an electric guitar, which allows you to use one 
of five different amplifiers and a number of stompboxes (those effect 
pedals that guitarists are always poking with their foot to change the 
sound of their instruments).
 
✦ Podcast artwork track: You get only one of these; they hold photos that 
will appear on a video iPod (or a window on your iWeb site) when your 
podcast is playing.

✦ Video tracks: The video sound track appears if you’re scoring (adding 
music) to an iMovie movie. Along with the video sound track, you get a 
cool companion video track that shows the clips in your movie. (More 
on this in the “Look, I’m John Williams!” sidebar, later in this chapter.)
Time to add a software instrument track of your very own. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create a New Track button (which carries a plus sign), 
labeled in Figure 6-1.
 
 GarageBand displays the New Track dialog.
 
2. Click the Software Instrument radio button and then click Create.
 
 See all those great instruments in the Track Info pane on the right?
 
3. Choose the general instrument category by clicking it.
 
 I chose Drum Kits.
 
4. From the right column, choose your specific style of weapon, such as 
Rock Kit for an arena sound.
 
 Figure 6-3 illustrates the new track that appears in your list when you 
follow these steps.

If you’re creating a podcast and you want to add a series of still images that will 
appear on a video iPod’s screen (or on your iWeb page), follow these steps:
 
1. Click the View Media Browser button (labeled in Figure 6-1).
 
2. Click the Photos button.
 
 GarageBand displays all the photos in your iPhoto library and Events.
 
3. Drag an image from your iPhoto library in the media browser to the 
Track list.
 
 The Podcast track appears at the top of the Track list, and you can add 
and move images in the list at any time, just like the loops that you add 
to your instrument tracks. (More on adding and rearranging the con-
tents of a track later in this section.)
Choosing loops
When you have a new, empty track, you can add something that you can hear. 
You do that by adding loops to your track from the Loop Browser — Apple 
provides you with thousands of loops to choose among — and photos from 
your media browser. Click the Loop Browser button (which bears the all-seeing 
eye) to display your collection, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
If your browser looks different from what you see in Figure 6-4, that’s 
because of the view mode you’re using, just like the different view modes 
available for a Finder window. The three-icon button in the upper-left corner 
of the Loop Browser toggles the browser display between column, musical 
button, and podcast sounds view. Click the middle of the three buttons to 
switch to button mode.
Looking for just the right loop
The track in this running example uses a Rock drum kit, but we haven’t 
added a loop yet. (Refer to Figure 6-3.) Follow these steps to search through 
your loop library for just the right rhythm:
 
1. Click the button that corresponds to the instrument you’re using.
 
 In our example, this is the Kits button in the Loop Browser. Click it, and 
a list of different beats appears in the pane at the bottom of the Loop 
Browser window. (Check out Figure 6-4 for a sneak peek.)
 
2. Click one of the loops with a green musical-note icon.
 
 Go ahead; this is where things get fun! GarageBand begins playing the loop 
nonstop, allowing you to get a feel for how that particular loop sounds.
 
 Because I’m using only software instruments in this track (and through-
out this chapter), you should choose only software instrument loops, 
which are identified by a green musical-note icon.

3. Click another entry in the list, and the application switches 
immediately to that loop.
 
 Now you’re beginning to understand why GarageBand is so cool for both 
musicians and the note-impaired. It’s like having your own band, with 
members who never get tired and play whatever you want while you’re 
composing. (Mozart would’ve loved this.)
 
 If you want to search for a particular instrument, click in the Search box 
(labeled in Figure 6-4) and type the text you want to match. GarageBand 
returns the search results in the list.
 
4. Scroll down the list and continue to sample the different loops until 
you find one that fits like a glove.
 
 For this reporter, it’s Southern Rock Drums 01.
 
5. Drag the entry to your Rock Kit track and drop it at the very begin-
ning of the Timeline (as indicated by the playhead).
 
 Your window will look like Figure 6-5.
 
If you want that same beat throughout the song, you don’t need to add any 
more loops to that track. (More on extending that beat in the next section.) 
However, if you want the drum’s beat to change later in the song, you add a 
second loop after the first one in the same track. For now, leave this track as is.

Whoops! Did you do something that you regret? Don’t forget that you can 
undo most actions in GarageBand by pressing the old standby Ô+Z immedi-
ately afterward.
Second verse, same as the first
When you compose, you can add tracks for each instrument that you want 
in your song:
 
✦ Each track can have more than one loop.
 
✦ Loops don’t have to start at the beginning; you can drop a loop any-
where in the Timeline.
For example, in Figure 6-6, you can see that my drum kit kicks in first, but my 
bass line doesn’t begin until some time later (for a funkier opening).
 
You put loops on separate tracks so that they can play simultaneously on 
different instruments. If all your loops in a song are added on the same track, 
you hear only one loop at any one time, and all the loops use the same soft-
ware instrument. By creating multiple tracks, you give yourself the elbow 
room to bring in the entire band at the same time. It’s uber-convenient to 
compose your song when you can see each instrument’s loops and where 
they fall in the song.

Look, I’m John Williams!
You, too, can be a famous composer of sound-
tracks . . . well, perhaps not quite as famous as 
Mr. Williams, but even he had to start some-
where. To add a GarageBand score to an 
iMovie, click the Track menu and then click 
Show Movie Track to display the Movie track. 
Choose a movie to score from the familiar con-
fines of the Media Browser, and drag it to the 
Movie Track.
At this point, you add and modify instrument 
tracks and loops just as you would any other 
GarageBand project. The existing sound for 
the iMovie project appears in the Movie Sound 
track. A Video Preview pane appears on top 
of the Track Info pane on the right side of the 
GarageBand window. When you click the Play 
button, the video is shown as well so that you 
can check your work and tweak settings (as 
described later in the chapter).
After you’ve finished composing, you can click 
Share on the menu bar and choose to export 
your work to iDVD, as a QuickTime movie 
directly to your hard drive, or to iTunes as a 
movie. Note that you can’t return to iMovie with 
your project, so scoring should be a final step in 
the production of your movie.

Resizing, repeating, and moving loops
If you haven’t already tried listening to your entire song, try it now. You 
can click Play at any time without wreaking havoc on your carefully created 
tracks. Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it?
But wait: I bet the song stopped after about five seconds, right? (You can 
watch the passing seconds using either the Time/Tempo display or the 
second rule that appears at the very top of the Timeline.) I’m sure that you 
want your song to last more than five seconds! After the playhead moves 
past the end of the last loop, your song is over. Click Play again to pause the 
playback; then click the Return to Beginning button (labeled in Figure 6-1) to 
move the playhead back to the beginning of the song.
 
Click the Reset button in the Loop Browser to choose another instrument or 
genre category.
The music stops so soon because your loops are only so long. Most are five 
seconds in length, and others are even shorter. To keep the groove going, 
you have to do one of three things:
 
✦ Resize the loop. Hover your mouse cursor over either the left or right 
edge of most loops, and an interesting thing happens: Your cursor 
changes to a vertical line with an arrow pointing away from the loop. 
That’s your cue to click and drag — and as you drag, most loops expand 
to fill the space you’re making, repeating the beats in perfect time. By 
resizing a loop, you can literally drag the loop’s edge as long as you like.
 
✦ Repeat the loop. Depending on the loop that you chose, you might find 
that resizing it doesn’t repeat the measure. Instead, the new part of the 
loop is simply dead air. In fact, the length of many loops is limited to 
anywhere from one to five seconds. However, if you move your cursor 
over the side of a loop that you want to extend, it turns into a vertical 
line with a circular arrow, which tells you that you can click and repeat 
the loop. GarageBand actually adds multiple copies of the same loop 
automatically, for as far as you drag the loop. In Figure 6-7, I’ve repeated 
the bass loop that you see in Figure 6-6.
 
✦ Add a new loop. You can switch to a different loop to change the flow 
of the music. Naturally, the instrument stays the same, but there’s no 
reason you can’t use a horn-riff loop in your violin track (as long as it 
sounds good played by a violin)! To GarageBand, a software instrument 
track is compatible with any software instrument loop that you add from 
the Loop Browser as long as that loop is marked with our old friend the 
green musical note.
 
You can also use the familiar cut (Ô+X), copy (Ô+C), and paste (Ô+V) edit-
ing keys to cut, copy, and paste loops from place to place — both on the 
Timeline and from track to track. And you can click a loop and drag it any-
where. After all, you’re working under Mac OS X.

Figure 6-7:

can keep

Each track can be adjusted so that you can listen to the interplay between 
two or more tracks or hear how your song sounds without a specific track:
 
✦ Click the tiny speaker button under the track name in the list, and the 
button turns blue to indicate that the track is muted. To turn off the 
mute, click the speaker icon again.
 
✦ You can change the volume or balance of each individual track by using 
the mixer that appears next to the track name. This comes in handy if 
you want an instrument to sound louder or confine that instrument to 
the left or right speaker.
A track doesn’t have to be filled for every second with one loop or another. 
Most of my songs have a number of repeating loops with empty space 
between them as different instruments perform solo.
Using the Arrange track
GarageBand includes another method you can use to monkey with your 
music: The Arrange track can be used to define specific sections of a song, 
allowing you to reorganize things by selecting, moving, and copying entire 

362
Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
sections. For example, you’re probably familiar with the chorus (or refrain) 
of a song and how often it appears during the course of the tune. With the 
Arrange track, you can reposition the entire chorus within your song, car-
rying all the loops and settings within the chorus along with it! If you need 
another chorus, just copy that arrangement.
To use the Arrange track, display it by clicking Track➪Show Arrange Track. 
The Arrange track then appears as a thin strip at the top of the track list. 
Click the Add Region button in the Arrange track (which carries a plus sign) 
and you’ll see a new, untitled region appear (as shown in Figure 6-8). You 
can drag the right side of the Arrangement region to resize it, or drag it to 
move it anywhere in the song.
 
Who wants an arrangement full of regions named “untitled”? To rename an 
Arrangement region, click the word untitled to select it (the Arrange track 
turns blue) and then click the title again to display a text box. Type a new 
name for the region and press Return.

Now, here’s where Arrangement regions get cool:
 
✦ To move an entire Arrangement region, click the region’s title in the 
Arrange track and then drag it anywhere you like in the song.
 
✦ To copy an Arrangement region, hold down the Option key and drag the 
desired region’s title to the spot where you want the copy to appear.
 
✦ To delete an Arrangement region, select it and press Ô+Option+Delete.
 
✦ To replace the contents of an Arrangement region with those of another 
Arrangement region, hold down the Ô key and drag the desired region’s 
title on top of the offending region’s title.
 
✦ To switch two Arrangement regions in your song — swapping the con-
tents completely — drag one of the Arrangement region titles on top of 
the other and release the mouse button.
Tweaking the settings for a track
You don’t think that John Mayer or U2 just “play and walk away,” do you? 
No, they spend hours after the recording session is over, tweaking their 
music in the studio and on the mixing board until every note sounds just as 
it should. You can adjust the settings for a track, too. The tweaks that you 
can perform include adding effects (pull a Hendrix and add echo and reverb 
to your electric guitar track) and kicking in an equalizer (for fine-tuning the 
sound of your background horns).
To make adjustments to a track, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the desired track in the track list to select it.
 
2. Click the Track Info button (labeled in Figure 6-1).
 
3. Click the Edit tab to show the settings shown in Figure 6-9.
 
4. Click the button next to each effect you want to enable. (The button 
glows green when enabled.)
 
 Each of the effects has a modifier setting. For example, you can adjust 
the amount of echo to add by dragging its slider.
 
 GarageBand offers a Visual Equalizer window that you can use to create 
a custom equalizer setting for each track. You can display the Visual EQ 
window by clicking the animated button next to the Visual EQ control on 
the Edit pane. To change the Bass, Low Mid, High Mid, or Treble setting 
for a track, click and drag the equalizer waveform in the desired direc-
tion. And yep, you can do this while your song is playing, so you can use 
both your eyes and ears to define the perfect settings!

Join in and jam . . . or talk!
As I mention elsewhere in this chapter, 
GarageBand is even more fun if you happen to 
play an instrument! (And yes, I’m envious, no 
matter how much I enjoy the techno and jazz 
music that I create. After all, take away my Mac, 
and I’m back to playing the kazoo . . . at least 
until I absorb all the Learn to Play lessons for 
the guitar.)
Most musicians use MIDI instruments to play 
music on the computer. That pleasant-sounding 
acronym stands for Musical Instrument Digital 
Interface. A wide variety of MIDI instruments is 
available these days, from traditional MIDI key-
boards to more exotic fun, such as MIDI saxo-
phones. For example, Apple sells a 49-key MIDI 
keyboard from M-Audio for around $100; it uses 
a USB connection to your Mac.
Most MIDI instruments on the market today use 
a USB connection. If you have an older instru-
ment with traditional MIDI ports — they’re 
round, so you’ll never confuse them with USB 
connectors — you need a USB-to-MIDI con-
verter. You can find this type of converter on 
the Apple Web site for around $50. (If you’re 
recording your voice for a podcast, things are 
easier because you can use your Mac’s built-in 
microphone.)
After your instrument is connected, you can 
record tracks using any software instrument. 
Create a new software instrument track as I 
demonstrate in this chapter, select it, and then 
play a few notes. Suddenly you’re playing the 
instrument you chose! (If nothing happens, 
check the MIDI status light — which appears in 
the time display — to see whether it blinks with 
each note you play. If not, check the installation 
of your MIDI connection and make sure you’ve 
loaded any required drivers.)
Drag the playhead to a beat or two before 
the spot in the Timeline where you want your 
recording to start. This gives you time to match 
the beat. Then click the big red Record button 
and start jamming or speaking! When you’re fin-
ished, click the Play button to stop recording.
To create a song automatically, follow these steps:
 
1. Close all GarageBand windows.
 
 If you’re currently working on a song, GarageBand will prompt you to 
save it before closing the window.
 
2. Click the Magic GarageBand button in the New Project dialog.
 
3. Click the desired genre button and click Choose.
 
 Hover your mouse cursor over a genre button to get a preview of the 
song for that genre.
 
4. To hear the entire song with the default instruments, click Entire Song 
and press the Play button.
 
 Alternatively, to hear a short sample of the song, click Snippet and press 
the Play button.

After you finish your song, you can play it whenever you like through 
GarageBand. But then again, that isn’t really what you want, is it? You want 
to share your music with others with an audio CD or download it to your 
iPod so that you can enjoy it yourself while walking through the mall!
iTunes to the rescue! As with as the other iLife applications that I cover in 
this book, GarageBand can share the music you make through the digital 
hub that is your Mac.

Hey, GarageBand, teach me how to play!
Until the arrival of GarageBand ’09, you were 
limited to creating music — and if you were a 
nonmusician like yours truly, GarageBand had 
no practical use as a tool for teaching yourself 
how to actually play an instrument.
Ah, but Apple’s introduction of Learn to Play 
actually turns GarageBand into your private 
video tutor for basic piano and guitar! From 
the New Project dialog, click the Learn to Play 
heading to display your lessons. Right out of the 
box, you have an Introduction to both instru-
ments, but you can download eight more free 
lessons for each instrument from the Lesson 
Store — and they cover more advanced topics 
such as fingering and chords. Tim, your on-
screen instructor, can even record what you 
play.
If you find the free Learn to Play lessons valu-
able, you can move up to the Artist lessons, 
which are actually taught by famous musi-
cians (including favorites of mine such as John 
Fogerty and Sting, who actually teaches you 
how to play “Roxanne”)! Each Artist lesson is 
$4.99 — well worth the price.
Creating MP3 and AAC files and ringtones
You can create an MP3 or AAC file (or even an iPhone ringtone) from your 
song or podcast project in just a few simple steps:
 
1. Open the song that you want to share.
 
2. Choose Share➪Send Song to iTunes.
 
 GarageBand displays the settings you see in Figure 6-11.
 
 To create a ringtone and send it to iTunes, choose Share➪Send 
Ringtones to iTunes.
 
3. Click in each of the four text boxes to type the playlist, artist name, 
composer name, and album name for the tracks you create.
 
 You can leave the defaults as they are, if you prefer. Each track that you 
export is named after the song’s name in GarageBand.
 
4. Click the Compress Using pop-up menu and choose the encoder 
GarageBand should use to compress your song file.
 
 The default is AAC, but you can also choose MP3 encoding for greater 
compatibility.
 
5. Click the Audio Settings pop-up menu to select the proper audio qual-
ity for the finished file.
 
 The higher the quality, the larger the file. GarageBand displays the 
approximate file size and finished file information in the description box.
 
6. Click Share.

368
Sharing Your Songs and Podcasts
After a second or two of hard work, your Mac opens the iTunes window and 
highlights the new (or existing) playlist that contains your new song.
Sending a podcast to iWeb or iTunes
If you’ve prepared a new podcast episode in GarageBand, you can send it 
automatically to iWeb or iTunes by following these steps:
 
1. Open the podcast that you want to export to iWeb.
 
 Make sure that the Podcast track is displayed. If necessary, click 
Track➪Show Podcast Track to display it.
 
2. Choose Share➪Send Podcast to iWeb (or Share➪Send Podcast to iTunes).
 
3. Click the Compress Using pop-up menu and choose the encoder that 
GarageBand should use to compress your podcast file.
 
 Your choices are AAC and MP3 format.
 
4. Click the Audio Settings pop-up menu to select the proper audio 
quality for the finished file.
 
5. Click Share.

Web Site with iWeb
In This Chapter
✓ Introducing the iWeb window
✓ Planning your site
✓ Adding a new site and pages
✓ Editing pages
✓ Setting site and page attributes with the Inspector
✓ Publishing sites to the Internet
I
 keep telling everyone who’ll listen: The Web is simple. Or at least it 
should be.
Kids in preschool these days know how to use a browser. Millions of 
people contribute to Facebook pages, help to create the dynamic reference 
wonder that is Wikipedia, and correspond effortlessly through Web-based 
e-mail. Yet there’s one untamed wilderness that many Mac owners haven’t 
explored — or even set foot in! That’s the jungle of HTML, the language used 
to create Web pages. HTML is complex, and it’s not particularly fun, either. 
Have you thrown up your hands and declared, “I guess I’ll never get my own 
Web site on the Internet?”
Forget your Web site envy, fellow Mac enthusiast! With iWeb, Apple has pro-
vided a guide through that untamed wilderness . . . and suddenly it’s as easy 
and fun to create a Web site as it is to make a movie or write a song with 
your Mac. In this chapter, you discover how to design a site, import your 
own photos, and add all sorts of different pages.
Soon, you’ll proudly hold your head up high and declare to the world, “I am 
a Webmaster!”

Looking around the iWeb Window
Looking around the iWeb Window
All of iWeb’s features and controls fit into a single window, naturally, just 
as it does in iPhoto and iMovie. (I agree with the Apple software designers: 
Multiple windows equals confusing.) Figure 7-1 illustrates the iWeb window, 
complete with a Web site in progress. The stuff to keep your eye on includes
 
Figure 7-1: 
The iWeb 
window 
holds 
everything 
you need 
to put your 
mark on the 
Web.
 
 
✦ Toolbar: Located at the bottom of the window, the iWeb toolbar keeps 
all your major controls one or two clicks away.
 
 The iWeb toolbar contains different buttons, depending on the chore 
you’re handling at the moment. Figure 7-1 shows the set of toolbar but-
tons that you see when you’re editing a page.
 
✦ Layout: You need elbow room to build a Web page, so the Layout sec-
tion of the iWeb interface dominates the window. You create and edit 
your pages in the Layout display and then use it to preview and test-
drive your finished site.
 
✦ Site Organizer: The strip to the left of the layout display is the Site 
Organizer, which allows you to organize your Web sites, add new pages 
to a site, and select an existing page for editing.

Book III
Chapter 7
Crafting a Web 
Site with iWeb
373
Planning Your Pages
Before we get down to business, it’s overview time. You essentially follow 
three phases to put your new site on the Web:
 
1. Decide which pages you need.
 
2. Create a new site and build those pages.
 
3. Publish your site to your MobileMe account (or to a Web server using 
FTP).
I go over each of these phases in order. (They taught me that in college . . . 
along with the history of the Aztecs and the wonders of FIFO accounting.)
Planning Your Pages
Every properly designed Web site has a purpose: to inform, to entertain, and 
to provide downloads or contact information. The pages you add to your 
site should all reflect that common purpose.
iWeb can produce the following types of pages for your site:
 
✦ Welcome: This is the default first page that iWeb adds to a site you 
create. The Welcome page familiarizes your visitor with the idea behind 
your site, and perhaps offers a snippet of the latest developments on the 
site in a “What’s New” paragraph.
 
✦ About Me: This page provides a biography of you or another person, 
listing things like your age, favorite songs, and favorite foods. (After all, 
that’s important stuff.) Links are provided to your photo album pages 
and other Web sites you want to share.
 
✦ Photos: Oh, this is good stuff here — iWeb makes it easy to add one of 
those cool online photo galleries for your snapshots, complete with a 
Web slideshow! You can add Events and albums from iPhoto, too.
 
✦ My Albums: You can organize all your Photos and Movie pages on a 
single My Albums page. Visitors click a thumbnail to jump to the cor-
responding page Photos or Movies page — it’s a visual index done the 
right way.
 
✦ Movie: Got a QuickTime movie you’ve created with iMovie to share with 
others? This is the page that presents it to your adoring fans.
 
✦ Blog: Adding a Blog (or personal Web journal) page is a somewhat dif-
ferent beast: iWeb keeps track of each addition you make in an entry list 
so that you can quickly add or delete entries without requiring tons of 
scrolling, cutting, and pasting. A Blog page also includes an archive so 
that deleted entries aren’t lost forever.

374
Adding a New Site
 
✦ Podcast: Consider a podcast as an audio (or audio/visual) blog — it’s 
designed to be downloaded to a visitor’s iPod for later enjoyment. As 
does the Blog page, a Podcast page has an entry list and an archive list 
attached to it.
 
✦ Blank: Yep, an old-fashioned blank page, ready for you to fill with what-
ever you like.
Before you even launch iWeb, jot down on a piece of paper (or put in a 
Sticky) these important points:
 
✦ What message do I want to communicate to visitors?
 
✦ What tone will I use — funny, serious, or businesslike?
 
✦ What stuff do I want to offer: photos, movies, or podcasts?
Now you have the starting point for your site and you know what you want 
to include . . . so let’s get down with the Web!
Adding a New Site
When you open iWeb for the first time, the application creates a new site for 
you, and you can rename and modify this default site to your heart’s content. 
In fact, for many of us, one site is all we ever create — but iWeb can easily 
handle multiple Web sites, keeping them separate in the Site Organizer.
If there’s at least one existing site in your Site Organizer, iWeb automatically 
displays the last site you were working on. Therefore, if you want to create 
an entirely new site, you have to perform a little manual labor. Here are a 
number of different ways to add a site:
 
✦ Choose File➪New Site.
 
✦ Press Ô+Shift+N.
 
✦ Control-click (or right-click) in the Site Organizer and click New Site.
iWeb leaps into action and displays the template sheet you see in Figure 7-2. 
Scroll through the template themes in the list at the left of the sheet until 
you find one that matches the tone you decided on in the previous section. 
(Informal, formal, or silly, iWeb has templates that match every mood!) Click 
a template on the left, and the application automatically updates the page 
type thumbnails on the right.
When you choose a template, iWeb automatically provides your pages with 
a common background, color scheme, and fonts so that your finished Web 
site has a common theme throughout.

Site with iWeb
375
Adding a New Page
After you find the right look and feel, click the desired template in the scrolling 
list at the left, click the Welcome page thumbnail, and then click the Choose 
button. iWeb creates a new site heading in the Site Organizer, complete 
with the default Welcome page. Figure 7-1, shown previously, illustrates the 
Welcome page from a new site I created with the Main Event template.
 
Figure 7-2: 
Choosing a 
template for 
a new site.
 
Adding a New Page
Time to add the pages you plan for your site! For example, I’ve decided to 
add Photo and About Me pages to the new site I’ve created. In the following 
section, I discuss how to edit these pages to personalize them . . . but for 
now, I just want you to add the pages.
If you have multiple sites in your Site Organizer list, click the top-level head-
ing for the desired site to select it. You can add pages by
 
✦ Clicking the Add Page button on the toolbar at the bottom of the 
iWeb window
 
✦ Choosing File➪New Page
 
✦ Pressing Ô+N
 
✦ Control-clicking or right-clicking the site header in the Site Organizer 
and clicking New Page

376
Editing a Page
 
Want to start with an existing page as a basis for a new page? Right-click that 
page entry in the Site Organizer and choose Duplicate. iWeb creates a new 
page with exactly the same contents and adds it to the site.
Pages are listed under the main site heading in outline format, making it easy 
to expand or collapse a site by clicking the familiar rotating triangle icon 
next to the site heading. (Apple calls these disclosure triangles. Wowzers!)
Deleting a page — or a whole site, for that matter — is easy in iWeb. Right-
click the offending page or site heading in the Site Organizer and choose 
Delete Page/Delete Site. Note that iWeb doesn’t prompt you for confirmation 
here, so these aren’t commands to toy with.
Editing a Page
If you have your site framework complete, you can actually put your site on 
the Internet as is! Of course, the photos would all be of good-looking strang-
ers, and most of the text would read like Pig Latin nonsense. (Come to think 
of it, I’ve been on some real sites that aren’t much better. Go figure.)
I think we both agree, however, that you want to personalize your pages with 
your own information. To begin editing a page, click it in the Site Organizer.
Don’t I have to slave over a hot menu?
You would if you were building a Web site by 
hand or if you were using an old-fashioned Web 
creation application not designed by our favor-
ite company! (Insert smug expression here.)
Let me explain. . . . Every Web site needs a 
series of links called a menu that allows you to 
jump from one page of the site to another. (For 
instance, you’re probably already familiar with 
the “tabbed” menu at the top of the Apple Web 
site that you use to flit from the Mac OS X sec-
tion to the Support section to the Store section 
and back again.) In days of old, a site menu was 
often a nightmare to maintain, especially if your 
site changed often.
iWeb creates and maintains a menu for each of 
your sites automatically and places it at the top 
of your pages for you! (You might have noticed 
that the Welcome menu item already appears 
in Figure 7-1.) When you add or delete pages, 
the application updates your menu in the back-
ground.
This is the way software is supposed to be 
designed. Don’t you agree?

Editing a Page
Modifying text
First, update the text with your own information by following these steps:
 
1. Click the text you want to replace.
 
 As do most desktop publishing applications, iWeb uses boxes to enclose 
text. When you click the text, the box appears, with handles that you 
can drag to resize the box.
 
2. Begin typing your text.
 
 iWeb replaces the existing template text with the text you type, using 
the text formatting taken from the template. Don’t forget that you can 
paste text from the Clipboard by pressing Ô+V. To match the text style 
of the template, though, press Option+Shift+Ô+V.
 
 Mistakes are passé in iWeb. To undo your last action, you can always 
press the familiar Ô+Z keyboard shortcut or choose Edit➪Undo.
 
3. Highlight and format your new text as necessary.
 
 To make changes easier, click the Inspector button in the iWeb toolbar. 
The window you see in Figure 7-3 appears, allowing you to change text 
color, alignment, and spacing with aplomb. (You find more about the 
Inspector later.) You can click the Colors or Fonts buttons on the iWeb 
toolbar to display a Color Picker or Font Panel for the selected text.
 
4. Click outside the text box after you’re satisfied with the text.
 
Figure 7-3: 
Using the 
Inspector 
dialog to 
format text.
 

378
Editing a Page
Because you’re likely modifying everything on the template pages from the 
title to the last box on the page, repeat Steps 1–4 for each section of text you 
want to change.
Replacing images
If your page includes photographs that you want to change, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the image you want to replace.
 
 As it does a block of text, iWeb displays a box around the image, com-
plete with resizing handles.
 
2. Drag an image to the image box from a Finder window.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Show Media button in the toolbar, which 
displays the Media Browser you see in Figure 7-4. From this window, you 
can click the Photos tab to choose an image from your iPhoto library.
 
 You can hide the Media Browser to make more room for your page 
layout. Just click the Hide Media Browser button in the Toolbar.
 
3. Adjust your new image if necessary.
 
 Click the Adjust button, and iWeb displays a cool, semi-opaque dialog 
that allows you to tweak image settings, such as tint, brightness, and 
sharpness (see Figure 7-5). Click Enhance to allow iWeb to choose the 
settings it considers best for the image or click Reset Image to restore 
the photo to its original appearance. When you’re satisfied with the 
image, click the Close button on the dialog to return to the image box.

4. Click outside the image box (usually the page background) after 
you’re satisfied with the photo.
Again, lather/rinse/repeat for each image you want to change on your page.
Adding new elements
iWeb also makes it easy to add new items to a page. The list of extras includes
 
✦ Audio: You can add a song (complete with volume control, Play/Pause 
button, and progress slider) to your page! Either drag an audio file from 
a Finder window to your page, or click the Audio button in the Media 
Browser to select a song from your iTunes collection. You can drag any 
image to the player that appears. (How about a photo of your daughter 
instead of album art?)
 
✦ Photos: To add a new image box to your page, drag a photo from a 
Finder window to the iWeb layout section. Click the Photos button in the 
Media Browser to choose an image from your iPhoto library, or throw 
caution to the wind and drag an entire Event or an album to your new 
page! iWeb takes care of all the details.
 
✦ Movies: Yep, you guessed it: You can drag a movie clip from a Finder 
window to your page, or click the Movies button in the Media Browser 
to choose a movie from iMovie or your Movies folder.
 
✦ Text: Choose Insert➪Text or click the Text button in the toolbar.

380
Editing a Page
 
✦ Shapes: Click the Shape button in the toolbar to display the pop-up 
menu and then click the desired shape. (Don’t forget to resize it as you 
desire with the box handles.)
 
✦ Widgets: Click this button in the Media Browser to insert a widget (a Web 
applet) to your page. For example, HTML Snippet allows you to type 
HTML code directly into place on the page, or paste HTML code that 
you’ve copied from another Web site. You can also insert interactive 
Google Adsense advertisements or a Google Map. To populate the page 
with a MobileMe Gallery, choose the MobileMe Gallery widget and select 
a Gallery you’ve created using the iPhoto MobileMe Gallery feature. (For 
the complete scoop on iPhoto, cruise over to Chapter 3 in this minibook.) 
Other widgets include a countdown timer and YouTube videos.
 
 You can move a widget anywhere on a page by dragging it, and it can be 
resized just as a text box can. 
 
✦ Links: If you’re editing text and you want to insert a Web link, choose 
Insert➪Hyperlink and choose from the menu that appears. You can 
choose to link to another Web page or insert a link that automatically 
sends an e-mail message to the mail address you provide. You can also 
offer a file for downloading.
 
 iWeb can automatically detect e-mail and Web addresses that you type 
in a text box, so you don’t have to use the Links menu. To enable this 
feature, choose iWeb➪Preferences and click the Automatically Detect 
Email and Web Addresses check box to select it.
 
✦ Button. Your Web page can include buttons that allow your visitors to 
e-mail you or display the number of hits (visits) your page has received. 
Choose Insert➪Button and click an option to add or remove a specific 
button. (If the menu option is selected, the button appears on your 
page.) Blog and Podcast pages can also offer RSS feeds (for automated 
retrieval of new entries within a Web browser), subscriptions to your 
podcasts, and slideshows.
Doing the slideshow thing
Ready to offer a slideshow on your Web site? 
Again, we’re talking automation here! Add 
a Photo page to your site and notice that the 
Start Slideshow button is already in place at the 
top of the page. All you need to do is add the 
photos to the page, using the Media browser 
or dragging them from a Finder window. When 
your visitors click the Start Slideshow button, 
all the photos on the page are displayed in a 
pop-up window.
It’s important to note, however, that some 
Windows browsers don’t support this Slideshow 
feature. Other Mac owners using Safari can 
enjoy the show, but don’t count on older ver-
sions of Internet Explorer (or Firefox) to be able 
to handle it.

Book III
Chapter 7
Crafting a Web 
Site with iWeb
381
Tweaking with the Inspector
 
With these tools, you can use the Blank page template to create your own 
new pages. Personally, I prefer to use the professionally designed templates 
offered by Apple as starting points, removing whatever I don’t need and 
adding new content.
Most Web designers would strongly recommend that you use a common 
theme for all the pages within a site (to lend continuity). Of course, you can 
also stick your tongue out at those very same Web designers and select a 
different theme for every page! To select a different theme for a page, open 
the page in iWeb and click the Theme button in the toolbar; then click the 
desired thumbnail from the pop-up menu. Nothing’s lost but the old look of 
the page, so feel free to experiment to your heart’s content.
Tweaking with the Inspector
Earlier, you used the Inspector to change text formatting attributes — but this 
star performer can do much more than just that! To modify page characteris-
tics, click the page in the Site Organizer, display the Inspector, and click the 
Page Inspector button (which carries a document icon). These settings allow 
you to change the name of a page; you can also elect to include or exclude this 
page from the site menu, or to drop the site menu from this page.
If your site contains a Blog or Podcast page, you can click the RSS button to 
provide an automated RSS (RDF Site Summary) feed to your visitors. (For 
more information on RSS and how it works in Safari, see Chapter 5 of Book V.)
Don’t forget your site properties!
To make global changes to a site, click the site 
name in the Site Organizer. iWeb switches to 
the Site Properties screen (Figure 7-6), where 
you can change settings such as
 ✓ The name of the site
 ✓ Your contact e-mail
 ✓ Where the site is published (more on this in 
the next section)
 ✓ Password protection for MobileMe sites
You can also verify how much space is avail-
able on your iDisk, which is where iWeb stores 
your Web sites if you’re a MobileMe member. 
Heck, iWeb can even update your Facebook 
profile automatically when you publish your 
site! What will those Apple designers think of 
next?

382
Publishing Your Web Site
Publishing Your Web Site
After you finish with a new site — or you’re satisfied with the edits you make 
to existing pages — it’s time to get your masterpiece on the Web! Even the 
best Web site design is worth next to nil if it isn’t available on the Internet, 
and in this last section, I demonstrate how to publish your Web site to your 
MobileMe account or to a separate server maintained by a third party (per-
haps your ISP, your company, or Dave down the street).
As I mention in the “Don’t forget your site properties!” sidebar, you specify 
where your iWeb site will be published from the Site Properties screen. Click 
the site name in the Site Organizer to display the Publish To pop-up menu 
(Figure 7-6). iWeb offers the following publishing options:
 
✦ Publish to MobileMe: Your site is hosted by Apple as part of your 
MobileMe subscription. The application takes care of everything, 
uploading any changed pages or media.
 
✦ Publish to FTP Server: This publishing option provides you with a 
completely different collection of settings on the Site Properties screen. 
You’ll need to furnish iWeb with your Web server’s FTP settings (which 
should be furnished to you by the host) and your site’s address (or 
URL).
 
✦ Publish to a Local Folder: The final publishing option creates a folder 
on your hard drive that contains all the files to display your Web site. 
This is the option to choose if you’re not a MobileMe subscriber and you 
don’t use a third-party hosting service. You can add these files directly 
to your home or business Web server. Once again, you must supply the 
site URL as it will appear on the Internet after you copy or upload the 
site files to the server. (I describe how to set up Snow Leopard’s built-in 
Apache Web server in Book VIII, Chapter 4.)
After you’ve set the type of publishing the site will use, it’s time to take care 
of business! Click the site to select it in the Site Organizer and then click the 
Publish Site button on the toolbar. The application takes care of everything 
else, automatically uploading all pages and media (if you choose MobileMe 
or FTP publishing) or saving them on your hard drive (if you chose the Local 
Folder option).
 
In a hurry? You can elect to publish just the changes necessary to update 
your site: Instead of clicking the Publish Site button on the toolbar, click the 
File menu and choose Publish Site Changes.

Chapter 8: No, It’s Not 
Called iQuickTime
In This Chapter
✓ Viewing movies
✓ Listening to audio
✓ Converting media to different formats
✓ Keeping track of your favorite media
✓ Tweaking QuickTime preferences
Q
uickTime is a set of exciting technologies that gives you access to the 
greatest multimedia experience around. Despite its power, don’t be 
surprised if you don’t even realize that you’re using it sometimes. Built with 
the average Joe in mind, QuickTime Player takes multimedia to new heights 
without forcing its users to become rocket scientists in the process.
QuickTime Can Do That?
QuickTime was created by Apple to perform all sorts of multimedia functions. 
Although normally associated with movie playback, QuickTime Player can 
do much more. Whether it’s playing movies, audio, animation, or music, 
QuickTime acts as the main engine that drives all your multimedia needs.
 
✦ Media player: QuickTime Player’s main claim to fame is playing all sorts 
of media — and I do mean all sorts. Table 8-1 lists the most popular of 
the media types that QuickTime can play.
 
 The real beauty of QuickTime Player is that it transparently handles 
playback of all these media formats and more. You don’t even really 
have to know what each of these formats is to play them. QuickTime 
Player takes care of that for you.
 
✦ Internet media tool: When it comes to using media from the Internet, 
QuickTime is in a league all its own. In addition to playing the usual 
movies and audio files found on the World Wide Web, QuickTime can 
play (or display) 3-D scenes and animations. As if that weren’t enough, 
QuickTime even lets you interact with some media. For example, with 
QuickTime, you can navigate within 3-D worlds or play Flash games.

*Movies in MOV and AVI formats use a wide range of compression schemes, 
many of them proprietary. For this reason, QuickTime might not be able to 
play some MOV or AVI movies that you download.
Playing Media with QuickTime
QuickTime makes a world of movies, audio, graphics, and music instantly 
available to you. Whether you want to view professional movie trailers or 
listen to a garage band’s new single, QuickTime faithfully reproduces nearly 
any media format that you feed it.
To launch QuickTime Player, double-click its icon in the Finder. You can 
also launch QuickTime Player from the Finder by double-clicking a media file 
that QuickTime can play. (See Table 8-1 earlier in this chapter for a listing of 
these file types.)
 
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that QuickTime and QuickTime Player 
are the same thing: QuickTime is a technology that hides in the background 
waiting for instructions to do something with media; QuickTime Player is 
an application that uses the QuickTime technologies. You’ll do recording, 
media conversions, playback, and editing with QuickTime Player. What you 
won’t see is the QuickTime technology in action behind the scenes.
 
You can also launch QuickTime Player from its oh-so-convenient Dock icon. 
For more on the Dock, read Book II, Chapter 2.
Opening QuickTime movies
To begin viewing and hearing — aw, what the heck, how about absorbing — 
multimedia files, choose File➪Open File from the QuickTime Player applica-
tion. This isn’t the only way to open a file with QuickTime Player, though. 
Some of the other ways to open files with QuickTime Player are

Playing Media with QuickTime
 
✦ Drag a file to the QuickTime Player icon in the Dock.
 
✦ Right-click (or Control-click) a movie and choose Open With; then 
choose QuickTime Player from the pop-up menu.
 
✦ Double-click the media file in the Finder. If it has a QuickTime-style 
icon (a blue letter Q), it opens automatically in QuickTime Player.
Operating QuickTime Player
When you open a QuickTime file, QuickTime Player creates a new window to 
display it. All QuickTime Player windows have some common features:
 
✦ Close, Minimize, and Zoom controls: These three controls appear at the 
top-left corner of most windows in Mac OS X. You probably recognize 
them by their colors: red, yellow, and green, respectively.
 
✦ Resize handle: Drag the lower-right corner of QuickTime Player to resize 
its movie for playback. Hold Shift while dragging to break free from 
constrained resizing. If the document contains only sound media, the 
window grows or shrinks in a horizontal direction when you resize it.
 
 Any resizing that you perform makes no changes to the original file. 
QuickTime provides it for your convenience during playback.
Although some window features are common to all QuickTime Player win-
dows, many features depend on the type of media that you wish to play. 
Table 8-2 lists some of the window features that you might find and the 
media types associated with those features.

Playing Media with QuickTime
To make your life easier, QuickTime does a lot of work for you behind the 
scenes each time that it opens a media file. Although you might think that 
there are different combinations of controls in QuickTime Player, the reality 
is that the various media windows are more similar than they are different. 
Figure 8-1 shows the location of various QuickTime Player controls.

Playing media
Playback begins as you might suspect — by clicking the Play button. While a 
file is playing, the Play button toggles to a Pause button. Click that button to 
pause playback, which toggles the button back to Play.
Clicking the buttons with double arrows on them advances the playback 
head at high speed in the direction of the arrows. (Click once to advance 
at 2x speed; click again to increase the speed.). If the file has audio in it, 
you hear the playback at high speed, which sounds like an episode of those 
helium-inhaling Chipmunks. (Remember? Meee, I waaant a hooola hooop.) 
Despite its comical sound, it’s helpful for quickly scanning through a file.
 
You can also advance through the file by dragging the playback head in 
either direction. This action is permissible while the file is playing or when 
it’s stopped. When you drag the playback head, however, you miss out on 
the high-speed sound and video that you would get if you used the buttons.

Movie info
To see more information about the files that you’re playing, ask the expert: 
QuickTime Player. To view basic information about a movie, choose 
Window➪Show Movie Inspector or press Ô+I. The resulting window displays 
the following data:
 
✦ Source: Location of the file
 
✦ Format: Compressor and dimensions of the file
 
✦ FPS: Preferred rate of playback in frames per second (fps), shown only 
for video
 
✦ Playing FPS: Actual rate of playback in fps (available during playback 
only), shown only for video
 
✦ Data Size: Size of the file
 
✦ Data Rate: Preferred rate of playback (in bytes per second)
 
✦ Current Time: Position of the playback head (in units of time)
 
✦ Current Size: Actual movie dimensions (if you’ve resized the movie 
since opening the file)

These bits and pieces of information are read-only — you can’t change them 
from the Movie Inspector window.
 
If you’d like to share a multimedia file with others from your MobileMe 
home page on the Web, choose File➪Share. After you’ve typed a name and 
description for your new file, you can optionally click the Allow Movies 
to be Downloaded check box to let others download the movie from your 
MobileMe page. Click Publish, and QuickTime automatically takes care of the 
rest. Slick as a wet toad!
Most folks don’t think of QuickTime Player as 
a recording application. That’s because Apple 
provides applications (such as Photo Booth, 
iMovie, and iTunes) that have long been the 
recording tools of choice in the Mac universe. 
However, you can indeed record audio, video, 
and your Mac’s screen display with QuickTime 
Player, as long as your Mac is equipped with 
the proper hardware (a microphone or line-
in device for audio, and an iSight camera or 
external video camera for video).
When you’re ready to record, click File and 
choose either New Movie Recording, New 
Audio Recording, or New Screen Recording. 
You can select your input sources, recording 
quality, and saved file location by clicking the 
button with the down arrow. When all the set-
tings are correct, the process itself is a one-
click operation: Click the Big Red Button to 
start and stop recording. QuickTime displays 
both the recording time and the approximate 
hard drive space used so far. ’Nuff said.

Chapter 9: Turning Your Mac 
into a DVD Theater
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding what you need to watch DVDs on your Macintosh
✓ Using the DVD Player software
✓ Unearthing the mysteries of the hidden controls
A
ll the creative capabilities of the Mac OS X digital hub are a lot of fun, 
but at some point, you’ll want to take a break from work. In recent 
years, DVDs have exploded onto the home entertainment scene; because of 
its high fidelity, convenience, and seemingly limitless storage capacity, the 
DVD has taken consumers by storm. The idea of an honest-to-goodness 
theater in your home is now within the grasp of mere mortals (with, 
coincidentally, merely average budgets). Mac OS X has everything that 
you’ll need to enjoy a night at the movies without ever leaving home. In fact, 
I highly recommend the 24-inch iMac or the 17-inch MacBook Pro for those 
widescreen classics.
The DVD Hardware
Before you watch one second of film, get your setup in order. Playing DVDs 
requires a bit of hardware; fortunately, virtually all recent Macintosh 
computers come equipped with the stuff that’s necessary to watch DVDs.
To play DVD movies, you need either an internal DVD-compatible drive 
in your Macintosh or an external DVD drive with a FireWire or USB 2.0 
connection. DVD-ROM drives can only play discs, whereas others, such as 
the SuperDrive, can both play and record discs. Either type of drive works 
fine for watching movies on your Mac.
 
You can watch any standard DVD that you purchase at your local video 
store as well as any DVD that you create with iDVD. (For more on iDVD, read 
Book III, Chapter 5.)

The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
To watch Frodo Baggins, Don Corleone, or James Bond, you need DVD 
player software. Mac OS X comes stocked with the perfect tool for the task: 
DVD Player.
Apple’s DVD Player application is included with Mac OS X; you can find 
it within the confines of your Applications folder. But instead of rooting 
through the Finder, you can launch DVD Player an even easier way: Simply 
insert a DVD into the drive. As soon as you do, your Mac recognizes the disc 
and launches DVD Player by default for you. (Time for another round of 
well-deserved gloating about your choice of personal computer.)
 
This automatic behavior (the DVD playing — not necessarily the gloating) 
can be curbed, however. You can control what action Snow Leopard takes 
(if any) when you load a DVD via the CDs & DVDs panel within System 
Preferences. For all the details, visit Book II, Chapter 3.
However you choose to start DVD Player, you’ll notice that it offers two 
windows:
 
✦ Controller: The small, silver-colored, remote control–looking interface 
that holds all the controls for the Player
 
✦ Viewer: The large window where you view your DVD movies
In Full-Screen mode, of course, you won’t see the Viewer window, and the 
video will take up the entire screen. The controller appears as a floating 
opaque strip of controls along the bottom of the screen. To display the 
controls, move your mouse cursor to the bottom of the screen. Move the 
cursor to the top of the screen and you can switch chapters and jump to 
bookmarks. (I talk about both later in the chapter.)
If you’re already using a traditional DVD player, you’ll be right at home with 
Apple’s DVD Player. Even if you’ve never used a traditional DVD player, 
you’ll find that it’s not much different from using a software-based audio 
player such as iTunes.
Using the Controller
The Controller is the command center of the DVD Player software. Arranged 
much the same as a VCR or tape deck, all the familiar controls are present. 
Check it out in Figure 9-1.

The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
Table 9-1 details the fundamental commands present in the DVD Player 
Controller. Apple software usually has some goodies hidden beneath the 
surface, and DVD Player is no exception. The controls in DVD Player have a 
few functions that might not be obvious to the casual user. These are listed 
in the third column of Table 9-1.

The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
Keeping your eyes on the Viewer
As soon as you begin playing with the DVD Player controls, you’ll notice 
activity in the Viewer window, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
Figure 9-2: 
The Viewer 
is the real 
star of Snow 
Leopard’s 
DVD Player.
 
You can think of the Viewer window as a television inside your Macintosh, if 
it helps, but DVD Player goes one step further. Unlike a television screen, the 
Viewer has some nice tricks up its sleeve: For example, you can resize the 
Viewer window by using one of the four sizes listed in the View menu (Half, 
Actual Size, Double Size, Fit to Screen, and Full-Screen sizes). This is useful 
for watching a movie in a small window on your Desktop while you work 
with other applications. You can toggle your Viewer size from the keyboard; 
for example, select Half Size with Ô+0 (zero), Actual Size with Ô+1 (one), 
and Double Size with Ô+2 (two).
Movies on DVD usually are divided into 
chapters that enable you to jump directly to 
specific points. That way, you can jump right to 
the scene, say, where the flying monkey guards 
march into the Wicked Witch’s castle in The 
Wizard of Oz. (Or skip that egg-hatching scene 
in Alien that always makes you nauseated.) 
You can navigate to chapters, play the movie 
from the beginning, or check out special bonus 
features (such as trailers and documentaries) 
from the DVD’s main menu. To switch to a 
different chapter in Full-Screen mode, move 
your mouse to the top of the screen.

Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
If you’re only in it for the entertainment factor, you’ll probably want to resize 
the Viewer to fill the screen. I like to watch movies in Full-screen mode, 
which you can toggle with the Ô+F keyboard shortcut. If you want to take 
full advantage of all your screen space yet leave the Viewer window on-
screen for occasional resizing, choose Fit to Screen mode with Ô+3 (three).
Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
As anyone with a little DVD experience knows, DVDs can do a lot more than 
those archaic tapes that you used to feed your VCR. Apple has included 
several functions that allow you to explore the extra features and content 
provided with a DVD movie.
Controller extras
To use the additional Controller features, double-click the small tab at the 
rightmost (or bottom) edge of the DVD Player Controller. After you do, a 
trick drawer slides out, displaying the extra controls. (See Figure 9-3.) You 
can also display or hide the drawer with the Controls➪Open/Close Control 
Drawer menu command or by pressing Ô+] (that’s the right bracket key).
 
Figure 9-3: 
Expand the 
Controller 
to view 
additional 
controls.
 
 
Are you interested in fine-tuning the audio from your DVD movies? If so, 
choose Window➪Audio Equalizer, and DVD Player displays a ten-band 
equalizer. (I often use this feature to add extra bass to a concert DVD.) Click 
the pop-up menu at the upper right of the Equalizer window, and you can 
choose a preset (such as Bass Boost or Vocal Boost), or even create your 
own custom audio presets.
Table 9-2 summarizes the functions that you can perform with these 
additional controls.

Although you won’t find a Bookmark button on the Controller, DVD Player 
can set them nonetheless. A bookmark is a spot, like a favorite scene, that 
you specify in a movie so that you can return to it at any time. To set a 
bookmark at the current spot in the movie, click the Controls menu and 
choose New Bookmark, or press Ô+= (the equal sign key). DVD Player even 
allows you to name the bookmark so that it’s easier to remember. To return 
to a bookmark, choose Go➪Bookmarks and click the desired bookmark. (If 
you’re enjoying your movie in Full-Screen mode, move your cursor to the top 
of the screen to use the Bookmarks strip.)
DVD Player preferences
The DVD Player application has a variety of settings that you can access and 
adjust via its Preferences window. To open the Preferences window, choose 
DVD Player➪Preferences. This brings up the Preferences dialog.
This window consists of six panes:
 
✦ Player: Settings that affect how DVD Player operates
 
✦ Disc Setup: Settings for Audio, Subtitles, Language, and the Web
 
✦ Full Screen: Settings that determine your full-screen viewing configuration
 
✦ Windows: Settings for displaying on-screen information during playback
 
✦ Previously Viewed: Settings that determine what happens when you 
load a DVD that you watched already
 
✦ High Definition: Settings that specify how high-definition video is 
displayed on your Mac

Turning Your Mac 
into a DVD Theater
397
Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
The advantage of these Preference settings is that you can customize your 
copy of DVD Player to match your needs or desires. (Thanks yet again to the 
Cupertino Crowd!)
Player
The Player settings take care of much of the automation within DVD Player:
 
✦ When DVD Player Opens: These two check boxes affect what happens 
when you launch the DVD Player application. You can force DVD Player 
to play in full-screen mode and automatically begin playback every time 
you start the application.
 
✦ When DVD Player Is Inactive: If you’re multitasking while watching 
your movie in windowed mode, you can click another window to make it 
active. This check box determines whether DVD Player will automatically 
pause while you’re working in that other application.
 
✦ When a Disc Is Inserted: Besides automatic playback on startup, you 
can also make DVD Player start playing a disc automatically when the 
application is running already. (To illustrate: If this check box is deselected, 
loading a new disc won’t automatically start it playing if DVD Player is 
already running.)
 
✦ When Playing Using Battery: If you’re using a MacBook, you can 
conserve power while using DVD Player by selecting this check box. 
The DVD Player will “spin down” the DVD whenever possible, which 
may cause a short delay when you fast forward or rewind.
 
✦ When Muted: Do you answer a lot of telephone calls while you sneak a 
quick DVD movie at work? If so, be sure to enable this option. If you have 
to press the Mute button on your keyboard while a movie is playing, DVD 
Player automatically adds the subtitles/closed captions so that you can 
keep up with the dialog. Super sassy!
 
✦ During iChat with Audio: Another option for those who like to run 
multiple applications simultaneously. If you’re watching a DVD and start 
an audio chat in iChat AV, you can choose to either mute the DVD audio 
or pause the DVD playback until you click Play again.
 
✦ When Viewer Is Minimized: Watching a DVD at the office, eh? Enable 
this check box, and DVD Player automatically pauses the movie when 
you minimize the DVD Player window. (Managers label this feature 
downright sneaky.)
Disc Setup
The second tab of the Player Preferences window consists of these controls:

398
Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
 
✦ Language: Sprechen Sie Deutsch? DVDs are designed to be multilanguage-
aware. Feel like brushing up on your German, Spanish, or Chinese? You 
can control the language used for the audio, subtitling, and menus in 
this section.
 
✦ Internet: Some DVDs with DVD@ccess support can access information 
on the Internet. Mark this check box to allow that function.
 
✦ Audio: Click this pop-up menu to specify the default audio output signal 
that you’d like to use. You can also choose to disable the Dolby dynamic 
range compression feature, which might enhance the sound for two-
speaker systems; however, you don’t want to damage the lower-output 
speakers on a MacBook or MacBook Pro, so I recommend that laptop 
owners leave dynamic range compression enabled.
 
Multiple languages and Web access are not mandatory features of a DVD, so 
don’t be surprised if you see variations of support when it comes to these 
settings.
Full Screen
These Preference settings control the default screen display settings within 
DVD Player:
 
✦ Controller: I generally like to hide the Controller after a defined time of 
inactivity; select the Hide Controller If Inactive for xx Seconds check box 
if you agree. To set the delay period, click in the seconds box and type a 
new value.
 
✦ Displays: These options specify how DVD Player shares your Desktop 
with others: politely or downright rudely. You can choose to automatically 
dim other monitors while a movie is playing (if you have more than one 
display connected to your Mac), and DVD Player can stay in full-screen 
mode even if another application actually has the active window. Finally, 
you can choose to remove the menu bar altogether (often called kiosk 
mode), which helps cut down on interruptions and accidents if small 
hands are nearby — and you can optionally allow Snow Leopard’s 
screen saver to appear on the DVD menu in kiosk mode.
Windows
This pane gives you the chance to configure the behavior of the Controller 
and status information for the Viewer window:
 
✦ Options: Mark the Display Status Information check box, and DVD Player 
adds a small text box at the top-left corner of the Viewer window. In this 
text box, you see the name of the last task that you performed with DVD 
Player. For example, click the Stop button to see the word Stop dis-
played in the Viewer on top of the video beneath it. You can also set the 
Controller to fade away instead of just disappear — it’s eye candy, but 
doggone it, it’s good eye candy!

Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
 
✦ Closed Captioned: If you do decide to display the closed-caption text 
from a DVD movie, you can click the color buttons to specify the text 
color. You can also choose the font for your text.
Previously Viewed
This pane controls what happens when you load a disc that you’ve seen 
already . . . or perhaps your significant other watched it and didn’t tell you. 
(Insert growling noise here.)
 
✦ Start Playing Discs From: If you have to quit DVD Player for some 
reason, the application is smart enough to remember where you were, 
and you can choose to begin watching from the beginning, from the last 
position (where you were when you stopped the last time), or from a 
default bookmark. Alternatively, just select Always Ask, and DVD Player 
will prompt you each time this situation crops up.
 
✦ Always Use Disc Settings For: Select these check boxes to specify 
whether DVD Player should use the same settings you used the last time 
you watched this disc.
High Definition
The final DVD Player Preferences panel specifies how both standard DV and 
high-definition video from a disc you’ve created in DVD Studio Pro are dis-
played within the Viewer window. (As I mention earlier, the Viewer window 
size can also be changed from the View menu, but the settings in this pane 
control what defaults DVD Player uses.)
 
✦ For Standard Definition: You can choose to display the actual video 
size by default, or to use the default size provided by the DVD.
 
✦ For High Definition: These options affect how a high-definition video 
signal is displayed. Your choices include the actual video size, a height 
of 720 pixels, and a height of 1,080 pixels.
Don’t forget to click OK to save any changes you make to your DVD Player 
preferences.
After you have your DVD Player customized to your liking, get out the 
popcorn, pull up your favorite recliner, and let the movies roll!

W
hat’s the difference between word processing and desktop publishing? 
In a nutshell, it’s in how you design your document. Most folks use a 
word processor like an old-fashioned typewriter. Think Microsoft Word and a 
typical business letter. (Yawn.)
On the other hand, a desktop publishing application typically allows you far 
more creativity in choosing where you place your text, how you align graphics, 
and how you edit formats. I think desktop publishing is more visual and intui-
tive, allowing your imagination a free hand at creating a document.
In this chapter, I show you how to set your inner designer free from the 
tedious constraints of word processing! Whether you need a simple letter, a 
stunning brochure, or a multipage newsletter, Pages ’09 can handle the job 
with ease — and you’ll be surprised at how simple it is to use.

Creating a New Pages Document
Creating a New Pages Document
Every visual masterpiece starts somewhere, and with Pages, the first stop in 
creating your document is the Template Chooser window. To create a new 
Pages document from scratch, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click your hard drive icon and click the Applications entry in 
the Finder window sidebar. Double-click the iWork folder to open it.
 
 The iWork installation program offers to add a Pages icon to your Dock. 
If you’ll be using Pages often, it’s a good idea to use this option!
 
2. Double-click the Pages icon.
 
 Pages displays the Template Chooser window that you see in Figure 1-1.
 
3. Click the type of document you want to create in the list to the left. 
The thumbnails on the right are updated with templates that match 
your choice.
 
4. Click the template that most closely matches your needs.
 
5. Click Choose to open a new document by using the template you 
selected.

Open an Existing Pages Document
Of course, you can always open a Pages document from a Finder window — just 
double-click the document icon. However, you can also open a Pages document 
from within the program. Follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the Pages icon to run the program.
 
2. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
 
 The Open dialog operates much the same as a Finder window in icon, 
list, or column view mode.
 
3. Click the desired drive in the Devices list at the left of the dialog and then 
click folders and subfolders until you’ve located the Pages document.
 
4. Double-click the filename to load it.
 
If you want to open a Pages document that you’ve edited in the recent past, 
things get even easier! Just click File➪Open Recent, and you can open the 
document with a single click from the submenu that appears.
Saving Your Work
To save a Pages document after you finish it (or to take a break while 
designing), follow these steps:
 
1. Press Ô+S.
 
 If you’re saving a document that hasn’t yet been saved, the familiar Save 
As sheet appears.
 
2. Type a filename for your new document.
 
3. Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a location to save the 
document.
 
 Alternatively, click the button sporting the down arrow to expand the 
Save As sheet. This allows you to navigate to a different location, or to 
create a new folder to store this Pages project.
 
4. Click Save.
Touring the Pages Window
Before we dive into any real work, let me show you around the Pages 
window! You’ll find the following major components and controls, as shown 
in Figure 1-2:

Touring the Pages Window
 
✦ Pages list: This thumbnail list displays all the pages you’ve created 
within your document. (For a single-page document, of course, the 
Page list will contain only a single thumbnail.) You can switch instantly 
between different pages in your document by clicking the desired 
thumbnail in the list.
 
✦ Layout pane: This section takes up most of the Pages window — it’s 
where you design and edit each page in your document.
 
✦ Toolbar: Yep, Pages has its own toolbar. The toolbar keeps all the most 
common application controls within easy, one-click reach.
 
✦ Styles Drawer: This window extension allows you to quickly switch the 
appearance of selected paragraphs, characters, and lists. You can hide 
and display the Styles Drawer from the View menu or from the View 
drop-down menu on the toolbar.
 
✦ Format Bar: This button strip runs underneath the Pages toolbar, allowing 
you to format selected text, paragraphs, and lists on the fly.

Using Text and Graphics Boxes
Entering and Editing Text
If you’ve used a modern word processing program on any computer — 
including “freebies” such as TextEdit on a Mac or WordPad on a PC — you’ll 
feel right at home typing within Pages. Just in case, however, let’s review the 
high points:
 
✦ The bar-shaped text cursor, which looks like a capital letter I, indicates 
where the text you enter will appear within a Pages document. 
 
✦ To enter text, simply begin typing. Your characters appear at the text 
cursor.
 
✦ To edit existing text in your Pages document, click the insertion cursor at 
any point in the text and drag the insertion cursor across the characters 
to highlight them. Type the replacement text, and Pages automatically 
replaces the existing characters with the ones you type.
 
✦ To delete text, click and drag across the characters to highlight them; 
then press Delete.
Using Text and Graphics Boxes
Within Pages, text and graphics appear in boxes, which can be resized by 
clicking and dragging on one of the handles that appear around the edges 
of the box. (Hover your mouse cursor over one of the square handles and 
you’ll see that it changes to a double-sided arrow, indicating that Pages is 
ready to resize the box.)
You can also move a box, including all the stuff it contains, to another location 
within the Layout pane. Click in the center of the box and drag the box to the 
desired spot. Note that Pages displays blue alignment lines to help you align the 
box with other elements around it (or with regular divisions of the page, such 
as the vertical center of a poster or flyer). Figure 1-3 illustrates a box containing 
text that I’m moving; note the vertical alignment line that automatically appears.
 
To select text or graphics within a box, you must first click the box to select it 
and then click again on the line of text or the graphic that you want to change.

The Three Amigos: Cut, Copy, and Paste
“Hang on, Mark, you’ve covered moving stuff, but what if you want to copy 
a block of text or a photo to a second location? Or how about cutting some-
thing from a document open in another application?” Good questions, dear 
reader! That’s when you can call on the power of the cut, copy, and paste 
features within Pages. The next few sections explain how you do these 
actions.
Cutting stuff
Cutting selected text or graphics removes it from your Pages document and 
places that material within your Clipboard. (Think of the Clipboard as a 
holding area for snippets of text and graphics that you want to manipulate.) 
To cut text or graphics, select some material and do one of the following:
 
✦ Choose Edit➪Cut.
 
✦ Press Ô+X.
If you simply want to remove the selected material from your Pages docu-
ment (and you don’t plan to paste it somewhere else), just select the text 
and press the Delete key.

Formatting Text the Easy Way
Copying text and images
When you copy text or graphics, the original selection remains untouched, 
but a copy of the selection is placed in the Clipboard. Select some text or 
graphics and do one of the following:
 
✦ Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
✦ Press Ô+C.
 
If you cut or copy a new selection into the Clipboard, it erases what was there. 
In other words, the Clipboard holds only the latest material you cut or copied.
Pasting from the Clipboard
Are you wondering what you can do with all that stuff that’s accumulating in 
your Clipboard? Pasting the contents of the Clipboard places the material at the 
current location of the insertion cursor. You can repeat a paste operation as 
often as you like because the contents of the Clipboard aren’t cleared. However, 
remember that the Clipboard holds only the contents of your last copy or cut 
operation, so you must paste the contents before you cut or copy again to avoid 
losing what’s in the Clipboard.
To paste the Clipboard contents, click the insertion cursor at the location 
you want and do one of the following:
 
✦ Choose Edit➪Paste.
 
✦ Press Ô+V.
Formatting Text the Easy Way
If you feel that some (or all) of the text in your Pages document needs a facelift, 
you can format that text any way you like. Formatting lets you change the color, 
font family, character size, and attributes as necessary.
After the text is selected, you can apply basic formatting in two ways:
 
✦ Use the Format bar. The Format bar appears directly underneath the 
Pages toolbar, as shown in Figure 8-1. Click to select a font control to 
display a pop-up menu and then click your choice. For example, click the 
Font Family button and you can change the font family from Arial to a 
more daring font. You can also select characteristics such as the font’s 
background color (perfect for “highlighting” items) or choose italicizing 
or bolding. The Format Bar also provides buttons for text alignment (Align 
Left, Center, Align Right, and Justify).

410
Adding a Spiffy Table
 
✦ Use the Format menu. Most controls on the Format Bar are also available 
from the Format menu. Click Format and hover the mouse cursor over the 
Font menu item, and you can then apply bolding, italicizing, and under-
lining to the selected text. You can also make the text bigger or smaller. 
To change the alignment from the Format menu, click Format and hover 
the mouse cursor over the Text menu item.
Adding a Spiffy Table
In the world of word processing, a table is a grid that holds text or graphics for 
easy comparison. Many computer owners think of a spreadsheet program like 
Numbers when they think of a table (probably because of the rows and columns 
layout used in a spreadsheet), but you can create a custom table layout within 
Pages with a few simple mouse clicks.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the insertion cursor at the location where you want the table to 
appear.
 
2. Click the Table button on the Pages toolbar.
 
 Pages inserts a simple table and displays the Table Inspector. (Both are 
visible in Figure 1-4.)

Adding Alluring Photos
 
By default, Pages creates a table with three rows and three columns, with an 
extra column for headings at the top. You can change this layout from the 
Table Inspector — just click in the Body Rows or Body Columns box and 
type a number.
 
3. Click within a cell in the table to enter text. The table cell automat ically 
resizes and “wraps” the text you enter to fit. 
 
 You can paste material from the Clipboard into a table. See the earlier 
section “Pasting from the Clipboard” for details on pasting.
 
4. To change the borders on a cell, click the cell to select it and then 
click one of the Cell Border buttons to change the border.
 
 Select multiple cells in a table by holding down Shift as you click.
 
5. To add a background color (or even fill cells with an image for a back-
ground), click the Cell Background pop-up menu and choose a type of 
background.
Adding Alluring Photos
You can choose from two methods of adding a picture within your Pages 
document: as a floating object, meaning that you can place the image in a 
particular spot and it doesn’t move, even if you make changes to the text; 
and as an inline object, which flows with the surrounding text as you make 
layout changes.
 
✦ Add a floating object. Drag an image file from a Finder window and 
place it at the spot you want within your document. Alternatively, you 
can click the Media button on the toolbar and click Photos, navigate to 
the location where the file is saved, and drag the image thumbnail to the 
spot you want in the document. Figure 1-5 illustrates the Media Browser 
in action.
 
 Note that a floating object (such as a shape or image) can be sent to the 
background, where text will not wrap around it. To bring a background 
object back as a regular floating object, click the object to select it and 
click Arrange➪Bring Background Objects to Front. (More about back-
ground objects later in this chapter.)
 
✦ Add an inline object. Hold down the Ô key as you drag an image file from 
a Finder window and place it where you want within your document. You 
can also click the Media toolbar button and click Photos to display the 

412
Adding Alluring Photos
Media Browser. Navigate to the location where the file is saved, hold 
down the Ô key, and drag the image thumbnail to the spot where you 
want it in the document.

Manipulating images for fun and profit
If you add an image that appears too large or 
distorted within your Pages document, you can 
resize it at any time to correct the problem. To 
resize an image object, click the image to select 
it and then drag one of the selection handles 
that appear along the border of the image. 
(They look like tiny squares.) The side-selec-
tion handles drag only that edge of the frame,
whereas the corner-selection handles resize 
both adjoining edges of the selection frame.
When you hold down the Shift key as you drag, 
Pages preserves the aspect ratio of the image 
so that the vertical and horizontal proportions 
remain fixed.
You can also flip images. Click Arrange on the 
Pages menu bar to flip the image horizontally or 
vertically.

Are You Sure About That Spelling?
Adding a Background Shape
To add a shape (such as a rectangle or circle) as a background for your text, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the insertion cursor in the location you want. 
 
2. Click the Shapes button on the Pages toolbar and choose a shape.
 
 The shape appears in your document.
 
3. Click the center of the shape and drag it to a new spot.
 
 As can image boxes, shapes can be resized or moved.
 
4. Before you can type over a shape, remember to select it and choose 
Arrange➪Send Object to Background. 
Are You Sure About That Spelling?
Pages can check spelling as you type (the default setting) or check it after you 
complete your document. If you find automatic spell-checking distracting, you 
should definitely pick the latter method.
To check spelling as you type, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Edit and hover the mouse cursor over the Spelling menu item.
 
2. Click Check Spelling As You Type.
 
 If a possible misspelling is found, Pages underlines the word with a red, 
dashed line. 
 
3. Right-click the word to choose a possible correct spelling from the list, 
or you can ignore the word if it’s spelled correctly.
 
To turn off automatic spell checking, click the Check Spelling As You Type 
menu item again to deselect it.
To check spelling manually, follow these steps:
 
1. Click within the document to place the text insertion cursor where the 
spell check should begin. 
 
2. Click Edit and hover the mouse cursor over the Spelling menu item; 
then choose Check Spelling. 
 
3. Right-click any possible misspellings and choose the correct spelling, 
or choose Ignore if the word is spelled correctly.

Printing Your Pages Documents
Printing Your Pages Documents
Ready to start the presses? You can print your Pages document on real 
paper, of course, but don’t forget that you can also save a tree by creating an 
electronic, PDF-format document instead of a printout. (For the lowdown on 
PDF printing, visit Chapter 4 in Book VII.)
To print your Pages document on old-fashioned paper, follow these steps:
 
1. Within Pages, click File and choose Print.
 
 Pages displays the Print sheet you see in Figure 1-6.
 
2. Click in the Copies field and enter the number of copies you need.
 
3. Select the pages to print.
 
• To print the entire document, select All.
 
• To print a range of selected pages, select the From radio button and 
enter the starting and ending pages.
 
4. Click the Print button to send the document to your printer.

Sharing That Poster with Others
Sharing That Poster with Others
Besides printing — which is, after all, so passé — you can choose to share 
your Pages document electronically in a number of ways:
 
✦ Sharing on iWork.com. Apple provides a Web site, iwork.com, where 
you can invite others to view and comment on your Pages document. 
Click the iWork.com button on the Pages toolbar to get started, and the 
site will walk you through the rest of the process.
 
 You’ll need an Internet connection to use iWork.com (naturally), as well 
as an Apple ID and a working Apple Mail account. If you didn’t create 
an Apple ID when buying your Mac or installing Snow Leopard, you can 
save the day by clicking the Create New Account button on the iWork.
com site. If you’re not using Apple Mail yet, peruse Book V, Chapter 2 for 
all the details.
 
✦ Sharing through e-mail. Click Share➪Send via Mail, and you can choose 
to add your Pages document to a Mail message in three different for-
mats: as a native Pages document file as a Word format document; or 
as a PDF file. After you’ve selected a format, Pages obligingly launches 
Apple Mail for you automatically and creates a new message, ready for 
you to address and send!
 
✦ Sharing through iWeb. Again, click the Share menu, but this time 
choose Send to iWeb. Pages automatically opens the iWeb site you last 
edited and provides your Pages document as a native Pages document 
file or as a PDF file. (If your visitors may be using PCs, choose the PDF 
option.)
 
✦ Exporting. Don’t forget that Pages can export your work in one of four 
different formats: a PDF document; a Word format document; an RTF 
(Rich Text Format) file; or even plain text. Click Share➪Export, pick your 
format, click Next, and then select the location where Pages should save 
the file. Click Export and sit back while your favorite desktop publishing 
application does all the work.
 
 To keep your document as close to how it appears in Pages as possible, I 
recommend either PDF or Word. Your document will retain far more of 
your original formatting than an RTF or plain-text document would.

✓ Printing a Numbers spreadsheet
A
re you downright afraid of spreadsheets? Does the idea of building a 
budget with charts and all sorts of fancy graphics send you running 
for the safety of the hall closet? Well, good Mac owner, Apple has once again 
taken something that everyone else considers super-complex and turned it 
into something that normal human beings can use! (Much like video editing, 
songwriting, and Web site creation — heck, is there any type of software 
that Apple designers can’t make intuitive and easy to use?)
In this chapter, I get to demonstrate how Numbers can help you organize data, 
analyze important financial decisions, and yes, even maintain a household 
budget! You’ll soon see why the Numbers spreadsheet program is specifically 
designed with the home Mac owner in mind.
Before We Launch Numbers . . .
Just in case you’re not familiar with applications like Numbers and 
Microsoft Excel — and the documents they create — let me provide you 
with a little background information.

418
Creating a New Numbers Document
A spreadsheet organizes and calculates numbers by using a grid system of 
rows and columns. The intersection of each row and column is a cell, and 
cells can hold either text or numeric values (along with calculations that are 
usually linked to the contents of other, surrounding cells).
Spreadsheets are wonderful tools for making decisions and comparisons 
because they let you “plug in” different numbers — such as interest rates or 
your monthly insurance premium — and instantly see the results. Some of 
my favorite spreadsheets that I use regularly include
 
✦ Car and mortgage loan comparisons
 
✦ A college planner
 
✦ My household budget (not that we pay any attention to it)
Creating a New Numbers Document
As does Pages, the desktop publishing application that’s included in iWork 
’09, Numbers ships with a selection of templates that you can modify quickly 
to create a new spreadsheet. (For example, after a few modifications, you 
can easily use the Budget, Loan Comparison, and Mortgage templates to 
create your own spreadsheets!)
To create a spreadsheet project file, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your Applications folder and double-click the iWork ’09 folder 
to display its contents.
 
2. Double-click the Numbers icon.
 
 Numbers displays the Template Chooser window you see in Figure 2-1. 
 
 If Numbers will be a favorite application on your Mac, I highly recom-
mend that you allow the iWork ’09 installation program to add a 
Numbers icon to your Dock.
 
3. Click the type of document you want to create in the list to the left.
 
 The document thumbnails on the right are updated with templates that 
match your choice.
 
4. Click the template that most closely matches your needs.
 
5. Click Choose to open a new document using the template you 
selected.

Opening an Existing Spreadsheet File
If a Numbers document appears in a Finder window, you can just double-click 
the document icon to open it; Numbers automatically loads and displays the 
spreadsheet.
However, it’s equally easy to open a Numbers document from within the 
program. Follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the Numbers icon to run the program.
 
2. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
 
3. Click the desired drive in the Devices list at the left of the dialog and 
then click folders and subfolders until you’ve located the desired 
Numbers document.
 
4. Double-click the spreadsheet to load it.

420
Save Those Spreadsheets!
 
If you want to open a spreadsheet you’ve been working on over the last few 
days, click File ➪Open Recent to display Numbers documents that you’ve 
worked with recently.
 
The Template Chooser window also sports both an Open Recent button and 
an Open Existing File button. Convenience is A Good Thing!
Save Those Spreadsheets!
If you’re not a huge fan of retyping data a second time, I always recommend 
that you save your spreadsheets often (just in case of a power failure or a 
co-worker’s mistake). Follow these steps to save your spreadsheet to your 
hard drive:
 
1. Press Ô+S.
 
 If you’re saving a document that hasn’t yet been saved, the Save As 
sheet appears.
 
2. Type a filename for your new spreadsheet.
 
3. Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a location to save the file.
 
 This allows you to select common locations, such as your desktop, 
Documents folder, or Home folder.
 
 If the location you want isn’t listed in the Where pop-up menu, you can 
also click the down-arrow button next to the Save As text box to display 
the full Save As dialog. Click the desired drive in the Devices list at the 
left of the dialog and then click folders and subfolders until you reach 
the desired location. 
 
4. Click Save.
After you’ve saved the file the first time, you can simply press Ô+S in the 
future and your changes are saved.
Exploring the Numbers Window
Apple has done a great job of minimizing the complexity of the Numbers 
window. Figure 2-2 illustrates these major points of interest:
 
✦ Sheets list: Because a Numbers project can contain multiple spread-
sheets, they’re displayed in the Sheets list at the left of the window. To

switch between spreadsheets in a project, click the top-level headings 
(each of which has a spreadsheet icon).
 
✦ Sheet canvas: Numbers displays the rows and columns of your spread-
sheet in this section of the window; you enter and edit cell values within 
the sheet canvas.
 
✦ Toolbar: The Numbers toolbar keeps the most common commands 
you’ll use within easy reach.
 
✦ Formula Box: You’ll use the Formula Box to enter formulas into a cell, 
allowing Numbers to automatically perform calculations based on the 
contents of other cells.
 
✦ Format Bar: Located directly under the toolbar, the Format Bar displays 
editing controls for the object that’s currently selected. (If you enter an 
equal sign into the Formula Box, the Format Bar changes into the Formula 
Bar. No, I’m not making this up.) My goodness, this is starting to sound 
like that classic movie about the chocolate tycoon and those kids!

Navigate and Select Cells in a Spreadsheet
Navigate and Select Cells in a Spreadsheet
Before you can enter data into a cell, you need know how to get to the cell 
where you want to enter that data. You can use the scroll bars to move around 
in your spreadsheet, but when you enter data into cells, moving your fingers 
from the keyboard is a hassle. For this reason, Numbers has various movement 
shortcut keys that you can use to navigate, and I list them in Table 2-1. After you 
commit these keys to memory, your productivity shoots straight to the top.
You can use the mouse to select cells in a spreadsheet:
 
✦ To select a single cell, click it.
 
✦ To select a range of multiple adjacent cells, click a cell at any corner of 
the range you want and then drag the mouse in the direction you want.
 
✦ To select a column of cells, click the alphabetic heading button at the 
top of the column.
 
✦ To select a row of cells, click the numeric heading button on the far left 
side of the row.

Selecting the Right Number Format
Entering and Editing Data in a Spreadsheet
After you navigate to the cell in which you want to enter data, you’re ready 
to type your data. Follow these steps to enter That Important Stuff:
 
1. Either click the cell or press the spacebar.
 
 A cursor appears, indicating that the cell is ready to hold any data you type.
 
2. Type in your data.
 
 Spreadsheets can use both numbers and text within a cell — either type 
of information is considered data in the Spreadsheet World.
 
3. To edit data, click within the cell that contains the data to select it and 
then click the cell again to display the insertion cursor. Drag the 
insertion cursor across the characters to highlight them and then type 
the replacement data.
 
4. To simply delete characters, highlight the characters and press Delete.
 
5. When you’re ready to move on, press Return (to save the data and 
move one cell down) or press Tab (to save the data and move one cell 
to the right).
Selecting the Right Number Format
After your data has been entered into a cell, row, or column, you still might 
need to format it before it appears correctly. Numbers gives you a healthy 
selection of formatting possibilities. Number formatting determines how a 
cell displays a number, such as a dollar amount, a percentage, or a date. 
 
Characters and formatting rules, such as decimal places, commas, and dollar 
and percentage notation, are included in number formatting. So if your 
spreadsheet contains units of currency, such as dollars, format it as such. 
Then all you need to do is type the numbers, and the currency formatting is 
applied automatically. 
To specify a number format, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cells, rows, or columns you want to format.
 
2. Click the Inspector toolbar button.
 
3. Click the Cells Inspector button in the Inspector toolbar to display the 
settings you see in Figure 2-3.
 
4. Click the Cell Format pop-up menu and click the type of formatting 
you want to apply.

 See “Navigate and Select Cells in a Spreadsheet,” earlier in this chapter, 
for tips on selecting stuff.
 
2. Click the Inspector toolbar button.
 
3. Click the Text Inspector button in the Inspector toolbar to display the 
settings you see in Figure 2-4.
 
4. Click the corresponding alignment button to choose the type of 
formatting you want to apply.
 
 You can choose from left, right, center, justified, and text left and numbers 
right. Text can also be aligned at the top, center, or bottom of a cell.

Do you need to set apart the contents of some cells? For example, you might 
need to create text headings for some columns and rows or to highlight 
the totals in a spreadsheet. To change the formatting of the data displayed 
within selected cells, select the cells, rows, or columns you want to format 
and then click the Font Family, Font Size, or Font Color buttons on the 
Format Bar.
Format with Shading
Shading the contents of a cell, row, or column is helpful when your 
spreadsheet contains subtotals or logical divisions. Follow these steps 
to shade cells, rows, or columns:
 
1. Select the cells, rows, or columns you want to format.
 
2. Click the Inspector toolbar button.
 
3. Click the Graphic Inspector button in the Inspector toolbar.

Really — you can! First, select the row or column that you want to delete or 
that you want to insert a row or column next to, and do one of the following:

The Formula Is Your Friend
 
✦ For a row: Right-click and choose Add Row Above, Add Row Below, or 
Delete Row from the pop-up menu that appears.
 
✦ For a column: Right-click and choose Add Columns Before, Add 
Columns After, or Delete Column from the pop-up menu that appears.
Remember that you can also take care of this business from the Table menu. 
(Personally, I like to right-click.)
The Formula Is Your Friend
Sorry, but it’s time to talk about formulas. These equations calculate values 
based on the contents of cells you specify in your spreadsheet. For example, 
if you designate cell A1 (the cell in column A at row 1) to hold your yearly 
salary and cell B1 to hold the number 12, you can divide the contents of cell 
A1 by cell B1 (to calculate your monthly salary) by typing this formula into 
any other cell:
=A1/B1
By the way, formulas in Numbers always start with an equal sign (=).
“So what’s the big deal, Mark? Why not use a calculator?” Sure, but maybe 
you want to calculate your weekly salary. Rather than grab a pencil and 
paper, you can simply change the contents of cell B1 to 52, and — boom! — 
the spreadsheet is updated to display your weekly salary.
That’s a simple example, of course, but it demonstrates the basis of using 
formulas (and the reason that spreadsheets are often used to predict trends 
and forecast budgets).
To add a simple formula within your spreadsheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell that will hold the result of your calculation.
 
2. Click inside the Formula Box and type = (the equal sign).
 
 The Formula Box appears to the right of the Sheets heading, directly 
under the Button bar. Note that the Format Bar changes to show a set of 
formula controls (aka the Formula Bar).
 
3. Click the Function Browser button, which bears the fx label. (It 
appears next to the red Cancel button on the Formula Bar.)
 
4. In the window that appears, as shown in Figure 2-6, click the desired 
formula to add it to the Formula Box.

you.
 
 
5. After you finish, click the Accept button to add the formula to the cell.
That’s it! Your formula is now ready to work behind the scenes, doing math 
for you so that the correct numbers appear in the cell you specified.
 
To display all the formulas that you’ve added to a sheet, click the Formula 
List button in the toolbar.
Adding Visual Punch with a Chart
Sometimes you just have to see something to believe it — hence the ability 
to use the data you add to a spreadsheet to generate a professional-looking 
chart! Follow these steps to create a chart:
 
1. Select the adjacent cells you want to chart by dragging the mouse.
 
 To choose individual cells that aren’t adjacent, you can hold down the 
Ô key as you click.

2. Click the Charts button on the Numbers toolbar. The Charts button 
bears the symbol of a bar graph.
 
 Numbers displays the thumbnail menu you see in Figure 2-7.
 
3. Click the thumbnail for the chart type you want.
 
 Numbers inserts the chart as an object within your spreadsheet so that 
you can move the chart. You can drag using the handles that appear on 
the outside of the object box to resize your chart. Figure 2-8 illustrates 
the 3-D chart I generated with just a couple of mouse clicks.
 
 Click the Inspector toolbar button and you can switch to the Chart 
Inspector dialog, where you can change the colors and add (or remove) 
the chart title and legend.
 
4. To change the default title, click the title box once to select it; click it 
again to edit the text.
After you’ve added your chart to the sheet, you’ll note that it appears in the 
Sheets list, as also shown in Figure 2-8. To edit the chart at any time, just 
click on the corresponding entry in the Sheets list.

I
t seems like only yesterday that I was giving business presentations with 
a klunky overhead projector and black-and-white acetate transparencies. 
Fancy color gradients and animation were unheard of, and the only sound 
my presentations made was the droning of the projector’s fan. I might as 
well have been using tree bark and chalk.
Thank goodness those days are gone forever, because cutting-edge 
presentation software like Keynote makes slide creation easy and — believe 
it or not — fun! This is the application that Steve Jobs once used for his 
Macworld keynotes every year, and there’s so much visual candy available 
that you’ll never need to shout to wake your audience again.
In this chapter, I demonstrate how simple it is to build a stunning Keynote 
presentation, and how to start and control your slide display from your 
keyboard (or even your iPhone or iPod touch). Heck, we’ll even print your 
slides and notes so that your audience can keep a copy of your brilliant work!

Creating a New Keynote Project
Creating a New Keynote Project
As do the other applications in the iWork ’09 suite, Keynote begins the docu-
ment creation process with a Template Chooser window. To create a new 
presentation project, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click your hard drive icon and click the Applications entry in 
the Finder window sidebar. Double-click the iWork folder to open it.
 
 If presentations are your bread and butter, allow the iWork installation 
program to add a Keynote icon to your Dock. Your clicking finger will 
thank you.
 
2. Double-click the Keynote icon.
 
 The Template Chooser window that you see in Figure 3-1 appears. (I 
have to say that these are probably the most stunning visual building 
blocks I’ve ever seen in a presentation application. You should have 
heard the “oohs” and “ahhs” from the Macworld faithful when Steve 
Jobs demonstrated Keynote for the first time on the big screen!)
 
3. Click the Slide Size pop-up menu at the bottom of the screen to select 
the resolution for your completed slides.

Saving Your Presentation
 
 Although you don’t necessarily need to select an exact match for the screen 
resolution of your Mac, it’s a good idea to select the closest value to the 
maximum resolution of your projector. (If someone else is providing the 
projector, the default value of 1024 x 768 is a good standard to use.)
 
4. Click the template that most closely matches your needs.
 
5. Click Choose to open a new document by using the template 
you selected.
Opening a Keynote Presentation
If an existing Keynote presentation file is visible in a Finder window, you can 
double-click the document icon to open the project. If Keynote is already 
running, however, follow these steps to load a project:
 
1. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
 
2. Click the desired drive in the Devices list at the left of the dialog; then 
click folders and subfolders until you’ve located the Keynote project.
 
3. Double-click the filename to load it.
 
If you want to open a Keynote document that you’ve edited in the recent 
past, things get even easier! Just click File➪Open Recent and you can open 
the document with a single click from the submenu that appears. (Note that 
the Template Chooser window has both Open Recent and Open Existing File 
buttons as well.)
Saving Your Presentation
When you’re done working on a Keynote presentation (or if you’d simply like 
to safeguard your work in a world of power failures), follow these steps:
 
1. Press Ô+S.
 
 If you’re saving a document that hasn’t yet been saved, the familiar Save 
As sheet appears.
 
2. Type a filename for your new document.
 
3. Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a location to save the 
document.
 
 To select a location not on the Where pop-up menu, click the button 
with the down arrow symbol to expand the sheet. You can also create a 
new folder from the expanded sheet.
 
4. Click Save.

Putting Keynote to Work
Putting Keynote to Work
Ready for the five-cent tour of the Keynote window? Launch the application 
and create or load a project, and you’ll see the tourist attractions shown in 
Figure 3-2:
 
✦ Slides list: Use this thumbnail list of all the slides in your project to help 
you navigate quickly. Click a thumbnail to switch instantly to that slide.
 
 The Slide list can also display your project in outline format, allowing 
you to check all your discussion points. (This is a great way to ferret out 
any “holes” in your presentation’s flow.) While in outline mode, you can 
still jump directly to any slide by clicking the slide’s title in the outline. 
To display the outline, click View➪Outline. You can switch back to the 
default Navigator Slide list by clicking View➪Navigator.
 
✦ Layout pane: Your slide appears in its entirety in this pane. You can add 
elements and edit the content of the slide from the Layout pane.
 
✦ Toolbar: As does the toolbar in Pages and Numbers, Keynote’s toolbar 
makes it easy to find the most common controls you’ll use while designing 
and editing your slides. Clicking an icon in the toolbar performs an action, 
just as selecting a menu item does.

Working with Text and Graphics Boxes
 
✦ Notes pane: If you decide to add notes to one or more slides (either for 
your own use or to print as additional information for your audience), 
click View➪Show Presenter Notes to open the Notes pane. This text box 
appears under the Layout pane.
 
✦ Format Bar: Keynote displays this button strip underneath the Keynote 
toolbar, allowing you to format selected text, paragraphs and lists on 
the fly.
Adding Slides
Sure, Keynote creates a single Title slide when you first create a project, but 
not many presentations are complete with just a single slide! To add more 
slides to your project, use one of these methods:
 
✦ Click the New button on the Keynote toolbar.
 
✦ Choose New Slide from the Slide menu.
 
✦ Press Ô+Shift+N.
 
✦ Right-click (or Control-click) in the Slides list and choose New Slide from 
the menu.
Keynote adds the new slide to your Slides list and automatically switches to 
the new slide in the Layout pane.
 
Need a slide that’s very similar to an existing slide you’ve already designed? 
Right-click the existing slide and choose Duplicate to create a new slide just 
like it. (Consider it cloning without the science.)
To move slides to different positions in the Slides list (and therefore a different 
order in your Keynote slideshow), drag each slide thumbnail to the desired spot 
in the list.
Working with Text and Graphics Boxes
You’ve probably noticed that all the text within your first Title slide appears 
within boxes. Keynote uses boxes to manipulate text and graphics. You can 
resize a box (and its contents) by clicking and dragging one of the handles 
that appear around the edges of the box. (Your mouse cursor will change 
into a double-sided arrow when you’re “in the zone.”) The side-selection 
handles drag only that edge of the frame, whereas the corner-selection han-
dles resize both adjoining edges of the selection frame.

436
Working with Text and Graphics Boxes
 
To keep the proportions of the box constrained, hold down Shift while dragging 
the corner handles.
Boxes make it easy to move text and graphics together (as a single unit) to 
another location within the Layout pane. Click in the center of the box and 
drag the box to the desired spot; Keynote displays alignment lines to help 
you align the box with other elements around it (or with regular divisions of 
the slide, like horizontal center). As you can see in Figure 3-3, I’m moving a 
box on the slide to a new location, and Keynote has supplied alignment lines 
to help me place it correctly.
 
To select text or graphics within a box, you should double-click the box.
 
If you’re resizing a photo in a box, don’t forget to hold down the Shift key 
as you drag the frame. Doing so specifies that Keynote should preserve the 
aspect ratio of the image so that the vertical and horizontal proportions 
remain fixed. You can also flip images horizontally or vertically from the 
Arrange menu bar.

Formatting Slide Text for the Perfect Look
Adding and Editing Slide Text
As with Pages and Numbers — which also use boxes for text layout — Keynote 
allows you to add or edit text with ease. For example, double-click in a box with 
the text Double-click to edit, and the placeholder text disappears, leaving 
the field ready to accept new text. Any new text you type appears at the blinking 
cursor within the box. 
To edit existing text in your Keynote document, click using the bar-shaped 
cursor to select just the right spot in the text, and drag the insertion cursor 
across the characters to highlight them. Type the replacement text, and 
Keynote obligingly replaces the text that was there with the text you type.
If you want to delete existing text, click and drag across the characters to 
highlight them; then press Delete. You can also delete an entire box and 
all its contents: Right-click (or Control-click) the offending box and choose 
Delete from the menu that appears.
When the contents of a box are just right and you’re finished entering or 
editing text, click anywhere outside the box to hide it from view. You can 
always click the text again to display the box later.
Formatting Slide Text for the Perfect Look
Keynote doesn’t restrict you to the default fonts for the theme you chose. 
It’s easy to format the text in your slides — you can choose a different font 
family, font color, text alignment, and text attributes such as bolding and 
italicizing on the fly, whenever you like.
Select the desired text by double-clicking a box and then dragging the text 
cursor to highlight the characters. Now apply your formatting using one of 
these two methods:
 
✦ The Format Bar: The font controls on the Format Bar work just like the 
controls on the toolbar: Either click a font control to display a pop-up 
menu, or click a button to immediately perform an action. Clicking the 
Font Size pop-up menu, for example, displays a range of sizes for the 
selected text; — with a single click on the B (bold) button, you’ll add the 
bold attribute to the highlighted characters.
 
✦ The Format menu: The controls on the Format menu generally mirror 
those on the Format Bar. To change the alignment from the Format 
menu, click Format and hover the mouse cursor over the Text menu 
item. To change text attributes, click Format and hover your mouse over 
the Font menu.

438
Using Presenter’s Notes in Your Project
Using Presenter’s Notes in Your Project
As I mention earlier, you can type text notes in the Notes pane — I use 
them for displaying alternate topic points while presenting my slide show. 
However, you can also print the notes for a project along with the slides, so 
presenter’s notes are also great for including reminders and To Do points for 
your audience in handouts.
To type your notes, just click within the Notes pane; if it’s hidden, click 
View➪Show Presenter Notes. When you’re done adding notes, click in the 
Slide list or the Layout pane to return to editing mode.
 
To display your notes while practicing, use Keynote’s Rehearsal feature. 
Click Play and choose Rehearse Slideshow, and you can scroll through the 
notes while the slideshow runs. (More on slideshows in a second.)
Every Good Presentation Needs Media
Adding audio, photos, and movies to a slide is drag-and-drop easy in 
Keynote! Simply drag an image, audio, or movie file from a Finder window 
and place it at the spot you want within your document.
You can also use the Media Browser — click the Media button on the toolbar 
and click the Audio, Photos, or Movies button to select the desired type. 
Keynote displays the contents of your various media collections — like your 
iPhoto and iTunes libraries — or you can also navigate to the file’s location 
on your hard drive, or type in a filename in the Search box at the bottom of 
the browser. When you’ve found the file you want to add, drag it to the spot 
you want in the document. Figure 3-4 illustrates the Media Browser in action.
Adding a Background Shape
Text often stands out on a slide when it sits on top of a background shape. 
To add a shape (such as a rectangle or circle) as a background for your text, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the insertion cursor in the location you want.
 
2. Click the Shapes button on the Keynote toolbar and choose a shape.
 
 The shape appears in your document.
 
3. Click the center of the shape and drag it to a new spot.
 
 As with image boxes, shapes can be resized or moved.
 
4. When the shape is properly positioned and sized, select it and choose 
Arrange➪Send to Back.

Creating Your Keynote Slideshow
The heart of a Keynote presentation is the slideshow that you build from the 
slides you’ve created. A Keynote slideshow is typically presented full screen, 
with slides appearing in linear order as they are sorted in the Slides list.
In its simplest form, you can always run a slideshow from a Keynote project 
by clicking the Play button in the toolbar, or by choosing Play➪Play Slideshow 
from the menu. You can advance to the next slide by clicking your mouse, or 
by pressing the right bracket key, which looks like this: ].
Of course, other controls are available besides just the ones that advance to 
the next slide! Table 3-1 illustrates the key shortcuts you’ll use most often 
during a slideshow.
 
Keynote offers a number of settings that you can tweak to fine-tune your 
slideshow. To display these settings, choose Keynote➪Preferences and click 
the Slideshow button in the Preferences window.

during your slideshow!
Printing Your Slides and Notes
Okay, I’ll be honest: I don’t always print handouts for every presentation I 
give, just because some of the slideshows I run are short introductions to 
hands-on demonstrations. However, if you’re presenting a lengthy slideshow 
with plenty of information that you’d like your audience to remember, nothing 
beats handouts that include scaled-down images of your slides (and, option-
ally, your presenter’s notes).
You can also use Keynote to create an electronic PDF-format document 
instead of a printed handout, which your audience members can download 
from your Web site. (For the lowdown on PDF printing, visit Chapter 4 in 
Book VII.)
To print a hard copy of your slides and notes, follow these steps:
 
1. Within Keynote, click File and choose Print.
 
 Keynote displays the Print sheet you see in Figure 3-5.

pop-up menu to specify the number of slides that Keynote should 
print on each page.
 
3. Select the pages to print.
 
• To print the entire document, select All.
 
• To print a range of selected slides, select the From radio button and 
enter the starting and ending pages.
 
4. Select or deselect specific options from the Options column.
 
 You can include elements such as the date, borders around each slide, 
and the slide number as part of each page of the hardcopy.

Contents at a Glance

Chapter 1: Getting on the Internet
In This Chapter
✓ Selecting an Internet service provider (ISP)
✓ Understanding how your Mac gets on the Internet
✓ Setting up your Internet connection
I
’ll be honest — the Internet is a terribly complex monster of a network. 
If you tried to fathom all the data that’s exchanged on the Internet and 
everything that takes place when you check your e-mail for Aunty Joan’s 
fruitcake recipe, your brain would probably melt like a chocolate bar in the 
Sahara Desert. A shoebox full of archaic things is tucked under the Internet: 
communications protocols, routing addresses, packets, servers, and other 
hoo-hah that are beyond the grasp of just about everyone on the planet.
Luckily for regular folks like you and me, Mac OS X Snow Leopard closes the 
trapdoor on all these details, keeping them hidden (as they should be). You 
don’t have to worry about them, and the obscure information that you need 
to establish an Internet connection is kept to a minimum. In fact, the happi-
est computer owners I’ve met think that the Internet is a little blinking light 
on their DSL or cable modem: If the light blinks in the proper manner, all is 
well. (I don’t argue with them.)
In this chapter, I provide help and advice to those who are searching for an 
on-ramp to the Information Superhighway — and I lead you through the pro-
cedure of adding an Internet connection under Mac OS X. (In other words, 
you’ll get your light blinking properly.)
 
If you entered your Internet configuration information while you were in the 
Setup Assistant during the installation of Mac OS X, you can skip this chapter! 
The information contained herein is only for those who add or change their 
Internet connectivity after installing Mac OS X.
Shopping for an ISP
Before you can connect to the Internet, you must sign up for Internet access. 
If you already have an ISP (acronym-speak for an Internet service provider) or 
your company provides Internet access, smile quietly to yourself and skip 
to the next section. Otherwise, hang around while I discuss what to look for 
in an ISP and how to locate one in your local area.

446
Shopping for an ISP
If you’re unfamiliar with the term, an ISP is simply the company you contract 
with so that you can connect to the Internet. You may be contracting with a 
cable company, such as Comcast, Bright House, or Mediacom, or you may 
be using a service such as AOL, Juno, or Earthlink. All these are ISPs. 
ISPs are as thick as Louisiana mosquitoes these days, and often they’re 
judged solely by the amount that they charge for basic access. Cost defi-
nitely is a factor, but it’s not the only thing that should determine your 
choice in a service provider. Consider these guidelines when choosing or 
switching ISPs:
 
✦ Local calling rates: If you live in a rural area and you’re using a dial-up 
modem, check to make sure that all prospective ISPs offer local calling 
rates. Believe me, no matter how much fun and how useful the Internet 
is, it’s not worth hours of long-distance charges. (Oh, and don’t forget 
to make sure that your ISP has local access numbers in the cities that 
you visit regularly.) If your Mac doesn’t have an internal modem, you 
can always add an external USB modem for dial-up Internet access and 
faxing.
 
✦ Broadband service: Virtually all ISPs now offer digital subscriber line 
(DSL) or cable modem access. Collectively, these connections are called 
broadband because they offer the fastest method of transferring infor-
mation to and from the Internet. If you have a home business, a large 
family, or students — or you telecommute to your office — using broad-
band can make your life much simpler.
 
✦ Quality technical support: A 24-hour/7-day telephone support line is a 
godsend for the Internet novice — don’t settle for voice support during 
business hours. Forget e-mail-based support, too; your e-mail applica-
tion will be dead and gone if your Internet connection gives you prob-
lems. (Sound of your palm whacking your forehead.)
 
✦ Static IP addresses: A static IP address — the unique number that iden-
tifies your computer on the Internet — allows you to set up a profes-
sional Web server or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. (More on these 
adventures later in Book VIII, Chapter 4.) Most ISPs charge an additional 
amount for a static IP address, so it’s not really a good idea for a typical 
Mac owner at home. Suffice it to say, however, that a business or com-
mercial organization running a Web server or FTP server will benefit 
from a static IP address.
 
✦ E-mail accounts: Investigate how many individual accounts you receive 
with various ISPs. Also, find out whether you can maintain them yourself 
through a Web site. If so, that’s a good sign. Additionally, if the prospec-
tive ISP provides a Web site where you can read and send e-mail mes-
sages, you can stay on top of your e-mail even while you’re on the road 
or vacationing halfway across the globe.

Investigating Various Types of Connections
 
✦ Web space: If you want your ISP to host your Web site, this is a no-
brainer: The more space you get, the better. A minimum of 1GB is 
acceptable, but most ISPs provide 3GB or more these days. Also, beware 
of ISPs that charge you for your Web site if it receives a large amount of 
traffic: It can be expensive to host a popular Web site if you join one of 
these ISPs.
 
✦ Domain name service: Finally, the better class of ISP also offers a 
domain name service, which allows you to register something like your
namehere.com. For the most professional appearance, you can usually 
pay a yearly fee, and the ISP takes care of all the details in setting up 
your own .com or .org domain name.
Locating an ISP is easy in the modern, Internet-savvy world. In the order that 
you should try them, here are the tricks that I recommend for finding your 
local ISPs:
 
✦ Check with your cable or telephone companies. If you’re already sub-
scribing to cable service in your area, you’re likely to be a candidate 
for cable Internet access. Also, many local phone companies offer DSL 
access, but that access area is often limited to certain locations. Call 
the customer service numbers for these companies and check out what 
they offer — and don’t forget that a broadband cable or DSL connection 
is always more expensive than an old-fashioned, dial-up connection. 
(“Maude, did you see the Internet bill this month?”)
 
✦ Get recommendations from friends and neighbors. Folks love to give 
free advice. Ask them how much they’re paying, how reliable the con-
nection has been, and how well they rate the ISP’s technical support.
 
✦ Check your phone directory. Check the phone book for Internet service.
 
✦ Investigate ISP Web sites. If you have Internet access at work, a friend’s 
house, or your local public library, you can surf to The List (www.
thelist.com), where you can search for ISPs within your area code 
and location.
Investigating Various Types of Connections
Consider the types of connections that are available under Snow Leopard to 
link your Mac to an ISP (see the previous section for more about ISPs). You 
can choose among four pathways to digital freedom:
 
✦ A dial-up connection: Old-fashioned, yes. Slow as an arthritic burro, 
indeed. However, an analog (or telephone modem) connection is still a 
very viable method for reaching the Internet for most computer owners. 

448
Investigating Various Types of Connections
It’s the cheapest method available, and all you need for this type of 
connection is a standard telephone jack and a modem. Apple used to 
include a modem with every computer, but no longer . . . these days, 
you’ll have to buy an external USB modem to make the dial-up connec-
tion. (Apple makes one, or any Mac OS X–compatible USB modem will 
work fine.)
 
✦ A broadband connection: Be it through DSL (which uses a typical 
telephone line) or cable (which uses your cable TV wiring), broadband 
Internet access is many times faster than a dial-up connection. Plus, 
both these technologies are always on, meaning that your computer is 
automatically connected to the Internet when you turn it on and that 
connection stays active. With DSL or cable, no squeaky whine accom-
panies your modem while it makes a connection each time you want to 
check your movie listings Web site. Both DSL and cable require a special 
piece of hardware (commonly called a modem, but it really isn’t); this 
box is usually thrown in as part of your ISP charge. Broadband connec-
tions usually require a professional installation, too.
 
✦ A satellite connection: If you’re really out there — miles and miles away 
from any cable or DSL phone service — you can still get high-speed 
Internet access. The price for a satellite connection is usually much 
steeper than a standard DSL or cable connection, but it’s available any-
where you can plant your antenna dish with a clear view of the sky. Plus, 
a satellite connection is actually faster than other types of broadband 
access. Older satellite technologies actually required you to also use a 
dial-up connection — and the antenna could only receive, not send — 
but most ISPs that can handle satellite connections now offer satellite 
systems that both send and receive through the dish.
 
✦ A network connection: The last type of connection concerns those 
Macs that are part of a local area network (LAN) either at the office 
or in your home. If your Mac is connected to a LAN that already has 
Internet access, you don’t need an ISP at all, and no other hardware is 
required: Simply contact your network administrator, buy that impor-
tant person a steak dinner, and ask to be connected to the Internet. 
On the other hand, if your network currently has no Internet access, 
you’re back to Square One: You’ll need one of the previous three types 
of connections.
 
After you connect one of your computers on your network to the Internet, 
you can use an Internet sharing device to allow all the computers to share 
that Internet connection. Book VI, Chapter 4 goes into all the details on shar-
ing an Internet connection on a network.

Setting Up Your Internet Connection
Setting Up Your Internet Connection
Okay, so you sign up for Internet access, and your ISP sends you a sheet of 
paper covered with indecipherable stuff that looks like Egyptian hieroglyphics. 
Don’t worry; those are the settings that you need to connect to your ISP. After 
you get them in Mac OS X, you should be surfing the Web like an old pro.
 
Before you jump into this configuration, make sure that you’ve configured the 
Internet settings within System Preferences, as I discuss in Book II, Chapter 3. 
That way, you’ll already have entered your default e-mail and Web settings. 
You’ll also need to be logged in using an Administrator account.
Using an internal or external modem
Follow these steps to set up your Internet connection if you’re using your 
Mac’s internal modem or an external USB modem:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock and choose Network.
 
2. Select Internal Modem or External modem from the list at the left side 
of the pane.
 
3. Enter the settings for the type of connection that your ISP provides:
 
• If your ISP tells you to use PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): Click the 
Configure IPv4 pop-up menu and choose Using PPP. If your ISP pro-
vided you with DNS Server or Search Domain addresses, type them 
now in the corresponding boxes.
 
• If you’re using AOL: Click the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu and choose 
AOL Dialup. If AOL provided you with DNS Server or Search Domain 
addresses, click in the corresponding box and type them now.
 
• If you’re using a manual connection: Click the Configure IPv4 pop-up 
menu and choose Manually. Then click in the IP Address, DNS 
Servers, and Search Domains fields and enter the respective settings 
provided by your ISP.
 
4. If you need to enter PPP settings, click the Advanced button.
 
5. In their respective fields, enter the account name, password, tele-
phone number, and (optionally) the service provider name and an 
alternative telephone number provided by your ISP.
 
 I always like Mac OS X to connect automatically when I’m using a modem. 
I hate excess mouse movements, which usually lead to a bad case of 
Rodent Elbow. To automate your dial-up connection (allowing Snow 
Leopard to call your ISP whenever your system needs the Internet), click 
the Connect Automatically When Needed check box to enable it.

Setting Up Your Internet Connection
 
6. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences and save your changes.
Using Ethernet hardware
Follow these steps to set up your Internet connection if you’re using a net-
work, cable modem, or DSL connection:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock and choose Network.
 
2. Select Ethernet from the list on the left of the pane to display the set-
tings that you see in Figure 1-1.
 
Figure 1-1:

settings for 
an Ethernet 
Internet 
connection.
 
 
3. Enter the settings for the type of connection that your ISP provides:
 
• If your ISP tells you to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
(DHCP): Choose Using DHCP from the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu, 
and your ISP can automatically set up virtually all the TCP/IP settings 
for you! (No wonder DHCP is so popular these days.)
 
• If you won’t be using DHCP: Choose Manually from the Configure IPv4 
pop-up menu. Then enter the settings provided by your ISP in the IP 
Address, Subnet Mask, Router, and DNS Servers fields.
 
4. If your ISP uses PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet), click 
the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu and choose Create PPPoE Service.
 
5. Type an identifying name for the PPPoE service.

O
kay, how many of you can function without e-mail? Raise your hands. 
Anyone? Anyone at all?
I suppose that I can function without my Internet e-mail, but why should 
I? Mac OS X includes a very capable and reliable e-mail client, Apple Mail 
(affectionately called Mail by everyone but Bill Gates).
In this chapter, I discuss the features of Apple Mail and show you how 
everything hums at a perfect C pitch. However, you have to sing out, 
“You’ve got mail!” yourself. Personally, I think that’s a plus, but I show you 
how you can add any sound you like.
Know Thy Mail Window
To begin our epic e-mail journey, click the Mail icon in the Dock. Figure 2-1 
illustrates the Mail window. Besides the familiar toolbar, which naturally 
carries buttons specific to Mail, you find the following:
 
✦ Title bar: This heading at the top of the Mail window displays informa-
tion about the current folder — typically, how many messages it con-
tains, but other data can be included as well.
 
✦ Message list: This resizable scrolling list box contains all the messages 
for the folder that you’ve chosen. To resize the list larger or smaller, 
drag the handle on the bar that runs across the window. You can also 
resize the columns in the list by dragging the edges of the column head-
ing buttons.

454
Know Thy Mail Window
 
Figure 2-1:
The Apple 
Mail 
window.
 
 
 To specify which columns appear in the message list, choose View➪
Columns. From the submenu that appears, you can toggle the display 
of specific columns. You can also sort the messages in the message 
list from the View menu; by default, messages are sorted by the Date 
Received. (Alternatively, use Lazy Mark’s method: Just click the column 
that you want to sort by.)
 
✦ Mailboxes: The column at the left of the main Mail window is the Mailboxes 
list. You can click any of the folders to switch the display in the message 
list. The Mailbox list can be hidden or shown from the View menu by 
clicking the Show Mailboxes item, or you can press the Ô+Shift+M 
keyboard shortcut to hide or show it. To widen or narrow the Mailboxes 
list, click the divider at the right side of the list. Your mouse cursor turns 
to a line with double arrows — and drag it in the desired direction.
 
✦ Preview box: This resizable scrolling list box displays the contents of 
the selected message, including both text and any graphics or attach-
ments that Mail recognizes.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
455
Know Thy Mail Window
Mail uses the following folders (some of which appear only at certain times):
 
✦ Inbox: Mail you’ve received already.
 
✦ Outbox: Messages that Mail is waiting to send.
 
✦ Drafts: Draft messages waiting to be completed.
 
✦ Sent: Mail you’ve sent already.
 
✦ Trash: Deleted mail. As with the Trash in the Dock, you can open this 
folder and retrieve items that you realize you still need. Alternatively, 
you can empty the contents of the Trash at any time by pressing the 
Ô+K shortcut or by choosing Mailbox➪Erase Deleted Messages.
 
✦ Junk: Junk mail. You can review these messages or retrieve anything 
you want to keep by choosing Message➪Move To. After you’re sure 
nothing of value is left, you can delete the remaining messages straight 
to the Trash. (Junk mail filtering must be enabled from the Junk Mail set-
tings in Preferences before you see this box.)
 
✦ RSS: Messages from an RSS news feed that you’ve subscribed to. You 
find out more on RSS later in this chapter.
 
✦ Notes: This folder displays notes that you’ve made. I discuss how to 
create a new note later in this chapter.
 
✦ To Do: Ah, don’t forget those all-important reminders about washing the 
car, paying taxes, and picking up dog food on the way home. The To Do 
folder displays your To Do items, which I cover later in the chapter.
 
You can add new personal folders to the Mailbox list to further organize 
your messages. Choose Mailbox➪New Mailbox and then type the name for 
your new folder in the Name box. Click OK to create the new personal folder.
Messages can be dragged from the message list and dropped into the 
desired folder in the Mailbox list to transfer them. Alternatively, you can 
move ’em from the Message list by selecting the messages that you want to 
move, choosing Message➪Move To, and then clicking the desired destina-
tion folder.
Also note that Spotlight has staked its claim with the Search box at the 
upper right in the Mail toolbar.

456
Setting Up Your Account
 
What’s a smart mailbox?
Remember the smart folders you can create in 
the Finder? Well, Apple Mail provides something 
similar for your e-mail messages: the smart 
mailbox. The contents of a smart mailbox are 
actually links to messages and To Do items in 
your Mail folders; these links match the search 
criteria you specify, such as messages from a 
specific address or those that contain attach-
ments. Other criteria include the date an item is 
received, the subject of a message, the mailbox 
a message is stored in, and so on. You can use 
smart mailboxes to organize your messages and 
To Do items in different ways and identify those 
messages that require special (or immediate!) 
attention.
To set up a smart mailbox, choose Mailbox➪New 
Smart Mailbox, or click the Add button (which 
carries a plus sign) at the lower-left corner 
of the Mail window and choose New Smart 
Mailbox from the pop-up menu. Type a name to 
identify the mailbox and then click the Contains 
pop-up menu to choose either messages or 
To Do items. Click the Match pop-up menu to 
specify whether the search should match any 
one or all of your criteria. Now you can click 
the pop-up menus to specify what the search 
should find. To add a new criterion line, click the 
button with the plus sign. (To delete a criterion 
line that Should Not Be, click the button with 
the minus sign next to the offending line.) Note 
that you can also include messages from Mail’s 
Trash and Sent folders. When you’re ready, 
click OK, and the new smart mailbox appears 
in the Mailboxes list. It has a cool folder icon 
with a gear symbol, much like the gear symbol 
sported by smart folders in a Finder window.
If you’ve set up your smart folder, it automati-
cally maintains itself when you receive, send, 
and delete messages and To Do items, always 
showing whatever matches your criteria. Here’s 
a mind-boggler: Imagine what Ben Franklin 
could’ve done if he’d been able to use smart 
folders!
Setting Up Your Account
By default, Mail includes one (or more) of these accounts when you first run it:
 
✦ The account that you entered when you first installed Mac OS X: Go to 
the beginning — literally, Book I, Chapter 1 — to read about the first-use 
assistant that I discuss at the beginning of this book. If you entered the 
information for an e-mail account, it’s available.
 
✦ Your MobileMe account: If you registered for a MobileMe service 
account, it’s included.
 
✦ Upgraded accounts: If you upgraded an existing Mac OS system, your 
existing Mail accounts are added to the Accounts list in Mail.
Speaking of the Accounts list, choose Mail➪Preferences and click the 
Accounts button to display the Accounts pane that you see in Figure 2-2. 
From here, you can add an account, edit an existing account, or remove an 
account from Mail. Although most folks still have only one e-mail account, 

Book V
Chapter 2

457
Setting Up Your Account
you can use a passel of them. For example, you might use one account for 
your personal e-mail and one account for your business communications. To 
switch accounts, just click the account that you want to use from this list to 
make it the active account.
 
Figure 2-2:
The 
Accounts 
list, where 
all is made 
clear (about 
your e-mail 
accounts).
 
Adding an account
To add a new account within Mail, choose File➪Add Account to open an 
Accounts assistant that leads you through the process. ’Nuff said.
However, I’m a manual kind of guy — at least, that’s what I’m told — so I 
should describe the process. For our demonstration, I’ll add a typical ISP 
POP account from the Preferences dialog, which displays the same Accounts 
assistant.
Open the Preferences dialog by clicking Mail and choosing Preferences; then 
click the Accounts button on the Preferences toolbar. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add button at the bottom-left corner of the window, which 
carries a plus sign.
 
2. On the General Information pane, type your full name in the Full 
Name field — or, if this is to be an anonymous account, enter what-
ever you like as your identity — and then press Tab.

458
Setting Up Your Account
 
 Messages that you send appear with this name in the From field in the 
recipient’s e-mail application.
 
3. Type the e-mail address assigned to you by your ISP.
 
4. In the Password field, type the password supplied by your ISP for 
login to your e-mail account.
 
5. Click Continue.
 
 Here’s a great feature: If Mail recognizes the type of account you’re 
using, the assistant may offer to automatically complete all the required 
settings for you! (If the account is recognized, the Continue button 
switches to a Create button. Smile proudly and click Create, and you’re 
done.) If your account isn’t recognized by Mail, it’s no big deal — just 
continue with Step 6.
 
6. Click the Account Type pop-up menu and choose the protocol type to 
use for the account.
 
 You can select an Apple MobileMe account, a Post Office Protocol 
(POP) account, a Microsoft Exchange 2007 account, an Internet Message 
Access Protocol (IMAP) account, or a standard Microsoft Exchange 
IMAP account. If you’re adding an account from an Internet service 
provider (ISP), refer to the setup information that you received to deter-
mine which is right. Most ISP accounts are POP accounts.
 
 When you select an Account Type, the fields may change on the 
Accounts assistant, but they’ll still follow the same general order I give 
in this POP account demonstration. (In fact, there are fewer fields to fill 
out for IMAP accounts!) Keep the account information provided by your 
ISP handy because that data should include everything covered in the 
assistant.
 
7. In the Description field, name the account to identify it within Mail 
and then press Tab to move to the next field.
 
 For example, Work and Mom’s ISP are good choices.
 
8. In the Incoming Mail Server text box, type the incoming mail server 
address supplied by your ISP.
 
 If your ISP requires a login for security, you need to enter your server 
username and password.
 
9. Click Continue.
 
10. On the Incoming Mail Security sheet, click the Authentication pop-up 
menu and choose the authentication scheme used by your incoming 
mail server.
 
 Unless you’re told differently by your ISP, the default choice — 
Password — is very likely correct already.
 
11. Click Continue.

12. On the Outgoing Mail Server sheet, type a description for the server 
and press Tab.
 
 I typically enter the ISP name.
 
13. In the Incoming Mail Server text box, type the incoming mail server 
address supplied by your ISP.
 
14. If your ISP requires your e-mail application to authenticate the connec-
tion, select the Use Authentication check box and type the username 
and password supplied by your ISP into the corresponding fields.
 
15. Click Continue on the Account Summary sheet.
 
16. Click Done on the Conclusion sheet.
 
 You’re done! The new account appears in the Accounts list.
You can specify advanced settings for an account. I cover those in the sec-
tion “Fine-Tuning Your Post Office,” later in this chapter.
Editing an existing account
Need to make changes to an existing account? Choose Mail➪Preferences and 
click the account that you want to change. Mail displays the same settings 
that I explain in the preceding section.
Deleting an account
If you change ISPs or you decide to drop an e-mail account, you can remove 
it from your Accounts list. Otherwise, Mail can annoy you with error mes-
sages when it can no longer connect to the server for that account. Display 
the Mail Preferences dialog, select the account that you want to delete, and 
then click the Remove button (which is graced by a minus sign).
Naturally, Mail requests confirmation before deleting the folders associated 
with that account. Click OK to verify the deletion or click the Cancel button 
to prevent accidental catastrophe.
Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
The heart and soul of Mail — well, at least the heart, anyway — is receiving 
and reading stuff from your friends and family. (Later in this chapter, I show 
you how to avoid the stuff you get promising free prizes, low mortgage rates, 
and improved . . . um, performance. This is a family-oriented book, so that’s 
enough of that.)
After you set up an account (or select an account from the Accounts list), 
it’s time to check for mail. Use any of these methods to check for new mail:

460
Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
 
✦ Click the Get Mail button on the toolbar.
 
✦ Right-click the Mail icon in the Dock and choose Get New Mail from 
the menu that appears.
 
✦ Choose Mailbox➪Get All New Mail or press Ô+Shift+N.
 
✦ Choose Mailbox➪Get New Mail and then choose the specific account 
to check from the submenu.
 
 This is a great way to check for new mail in another account without 
going through the trouble of making it active in the Preferences window.
Mail can also check for new messages automatically; you can find more on 
this topic in the “Checking Mail automatically” section, later in this chapter.
If you do have new mail in the active account, it appears in the Message list. 
As you can see in Figure 2-3, new unread messages appear marked with a 
snazzy blue dot in the first column. The number of unread messages is dis-
played next to the Inbox folder icon in the Mailboxes list.
 
Mail also displays the number of new messages that you’ve received on its 
Dock icon. If you’ve hidden the Mail window or sent it to the Dock, you can 
perform a quick visual check for new mail just by glancing at the Dock.

Displaying all Mail headers
Mail actually hides the majority of the heading 
lines that help identify and route an e-mail mes-
sage to its rightful destination. By default, all 
you’ll see is the filtered heading, which includes 
only the From, Date, To, and Subject fields. This 
is great unless for some reason you need to dis-
play the entire message header in all its arcane 
madness. If you do, press Ô+Shift+H. You can 
toggle back to the filtered heading by pressing 
the same shortcut.
Reading and deleting your messages
To read any message in the message list, you can either click the desired 
entry (which displays the contents of the message in the preview pane) or 
you can double-click the entry to open the message in a separate message 
window, complete with its own toolbar controls.
 
To quickly scan your mail, click the first message that you want to view in 
the list and then press the down-arrow key when you’re ready to move to 
the next message. Mail displays the content of each message in the preview 
pane. To display the previous message in the list, press the up-arrow key.
Mail also allows you to read your messages grouped within threads. A 
thread contains an original message and all related replies, which makes it 
easy to follow the flow of an e-mail discussion (without bouncing around 
within your Inbox, searching for the next message in the conversation). 
Choose View➪Organize by Thread, and the replies in the current folder are 
all grouped under the original messages and sorted by date. To expand a 
thread, click the original message to select it; then press the right-arrow 
key (or choose View➪Expand All Threads). To collapse a thread, select the 
original message and press the left-arrow key (or choose View➪Collapse All 
Threads).
 
Hey, why not let Mail read you your mail? (That is, if you can drive and listen 
to your MacBook speak at the same time!) Simply select one message or a 
group of messages and then choose Edit➪Speech➪Start Speaking. Wowsers!
To delete a message from the message list, click the desired entry to select 
it and then click the Delete button on the toolbar (or press the Del key). To 
delete a message from within a message window, click the Delete button on 
the toolbar.

Replying to mail
What? Aunt Harriet sent you a message because she’s forgotten where she 
parked her car last night? If you happen to know where her priceless ’78 
Pinto is, you can reply to her and save her the trouble of retracing her steps.
 
If Aunt Harriet isn’t in your Address Book yet, this is a good time to add her. 
With the message entry selected in the list, choose Message➪Add Sender 
to Address Book or just press the convenient Ô+Shift+Y keyboard shortcut. 
The person’s name and e-mail address are added automatically to your 
Address Book. To add more information in the Address Book, however, you 
have to open that application separately. (Read through Book I, Chapter 6 
for the skinny on the Address Book.)
To reply to a message in Mail, follow these steps:
 
1. To respond to a message from the message list, click the desired mes-
sage entry and then click the Reply button on the toolbar.
 
 To respond to a message that you’ve opened in a message window, click 
the Reply button on the toolbar for the message window.
 
 If a message was addressed not just to you but also to a number of differ-
ent people, you can send your reply to all of them. Instead of clicking the 
Reply button, click the Reply All button on the Mail window toolbar. (This 
is a great way to quickly facilitate a festive gathering, if you get my drift.)
 
 You can also add carbon copies of your message to other new recipi-
ents, expanding the party exponentially; more on carbon copies later, in 
the section “Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail.”
 
 Mail opens the Reply window that you see in Figure 2-4. Note that the 
address has been added automatically and that the default Subject 
is Re: <the original subject>. Mail automatically adds a separator line 
in the message body field that reads On <day><date>at<time>, 
<addressee> wrote:, followed by the text of the original message; this 
is done so that the addressee can remember what the heck he or she 
wrote in the first place to get you so happy/sad/angry/indifferent. The 
original text is indented and prefaced by a vertical line to set it apart. If 
you like, you can click in the Subject line and change the default subject 
line; otherwise, the cursor is already sitting on the first line of the text 
box, so you can simply start typing your reply.
 
 To choose the text from the original message that you want to include in 
a reply, select the desired text in the original message before you click 
the Reply button.

2. After you complete typing your reply, you can select text in the mes-
sage body and apply different fonts or formats.
 
 To change your reply’s formatting, click the Fonts button on the mes-
sage window toolbar. From the window that appears, you can choose 
the font family, the type size, and formatting (such as italic or bold) for 
the selected text. Click the Close button on the Fonts window to con-
tinue. (If you like menus, you can also choose Format from the menu and 
make changes from there.)
 
 To apply color to the selected text, click the Colors button on the mes-
sage window toolbar and then click anywhere in the color wheel that 
appears to select that color. You can also vary the hue by moving the 
slider bar at the right of the Colors window. After you find the color 
that expresses your inner passion, click the Close button on the Colors 
window to continue.
 
 To create a bulleted list in your reply, click Format➪Lists and choose 
either a bulleted or a numbered list. Mail thoughtfully prepares your 
first bullet item for you. Press Return to add another bullet item. Click 
outside the bullet formatting to complete the list.
 
 Care to chat directly with the recipients of your message? Just click 
the Chat button on the toolbar, and Mail automatically opens iChat and 
attempts to connect! (Note that this will work only with the recipients 

464
Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
who have an instant messaging address in their Address Book card.) 
This Chat feature also appears on the New Message window toolbar, 
which I discuss in a page or two.
 
3. To add an attachment, click the Attach button on the toolbar.
 
 Mail displays a familiar Open dialog. Navigate to the to-be-attached file, 
select it, and click the Open button to add it to the message. (More on 
attachments in the “Attachments on Parade” section, later in this chapter) 
If the recipient is running Windows, make sure the Send Windows-Friendly 
Attachments check box is enabled — this results in a slightly larger e-mail 
message size but helps ensure that PC e-mail programs, such as Outlook 
and Outlook Express, can correctly open your attachments.
 
 Because most folks end up sending photos through e-mail, Apple 
includes a Photo Browser button on the toolbar. Click this button on the 
Reply or New Message window toolbars and you can choose a photo 
from your iPhoto library to insert directly into your message. Heck, you 
can even take a quick candid shot using Photo Booth! Naturally, your 
Mac will need an iSight camera (or other compatible video camera) to 
use the Photo Booth feature.
 
4. When you’re ready to send your reply, you have two options. You can 
click the Send button to immediately add the message to your Outbox 
folder or you can click the Save as Draft button to store it in your 
Drafts folder for later editing.
 
 After a message is moved to the Outbox folder, it’s sent either immedi-
ately or at the next connection time that you specify in Mail Preferences 
(more on this in the section “Checking Mail automatically,” later in the 
chapter). However, saving the message to your Drafts folder doesn’t 
send it. Read the following section for the skinny on how to send a mes-
sage stored in your Drafts folder.
When you reply to a message, you can also forward your reply to another 
person (instead of the original sender). The new addressee receives a mes-
sage containing both the text of the original message that you received and 
your reply. To forward a message, click the Forward button on the Mail tool-
bar instead of Reply or Reply to All.
 
If you don’t want to include the text of the original message in a reply, 
choose Mail➪Preferences. Click the Composing button and disable the 
Quote the Text of the Original Message check box.
By default, Mail checks your spelling while you type and also underlines any 
words that it doesn’t recognize. (Very Microsoftian.) I personally like this 
feature, but if you find it irritating, you can turn it off or set Mail to check 
the spelling just once (when you click Send). Just choose Mail➪Preferences, 
click Composing, and click the Check Spelling as I Type pop-up menu to 
choose the desired option.

Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail
To compose and send a new message to someone, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Message button on the Mail toolbar or choose File➪
New Message (or avail yourself of the handy Ô+N keyboard shortcut).
 
 Mail opens the New Message window that you see in Figure 2-5.
 
2. Enter the recipient’s (To) address by
 
• Typing it in directly.
 
• Pasting it in after copying it to the Clipboard.
 
• Dragging an e-mail address from your Address Book.
 
 or
 
• (My favorite) Clicking the Address toolbar button, which shows 
you the scaled-down version of the Address Book (the Addresses 
window) that you see in Figure 2-6.
Hey, what does MIME mean?
First, a note of explanation about Internet e-mail. 
(Don’t worry about notes; you won’t be tested 
on this stuff.) Decades back, Internet e-mail 
messages were pure text, composed only of 
ASCII characters — that means no fancy fonts, 
colors, stationery, or text formatting. However, 
as more and more folks started using e-mail, the 
clarion call rang forth across the land for more 
attractive messages (as well as attachments, 
which I cover in the section “Attachments on 
Parade”). Therefore, the MIME encoding stan-
dard was developed. In case you’re interested, 
MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail 
Extensions — a rather cool (and surprisingly 
understandable) acronym.
Originally, virtually all e-mail programs rec-
ognized MIME, but then the Tower of Babel 
principle kicked in, and now there are actually 
multiple versions of MIME. Apple Mail uses the 
most common variant of MIME, so most folks 
who receive your e-mail can see them in all 
their glory (even under Windows).
However, if one of your addressees complains 
that he got a message containing unrecogniz-
able gobbledygook and a heading that mentions 
MIME, he’s using an e-mail client application 
that either doesn’t support MIME or supports a 
different version. (Of course, that person could 
have unknowingly turned off MIME support.) 
You have two possible solutions: You can ask 
the addressee to double-check whether MIME 
is enabled on his end in the e-mail application 
or you can disable MIME when sending a mes-
sage to that particular person. When you’re 
composing an original message or a reply, you 
can use pure text by choosing Format➪Make 
Plain Text. (Naturally, this prevents you from 
doing anything fancy, and files that you attach 
to a plain-text message might not be delivered 
correctly.)

Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail
 
 From the Addresses window, click the address that you want to use and 
then click the To button. To pick multiple recipients, hold down the Ô 
key while you click the multiple addresses. Click the Close button on the 
Addresses window to close it; then, press Tab.
 
 If you have a huge number of entries in your Address Book, use the 
Search field on the Addresses window toolbar, which operates just like 
the Finder window Search box.
 
3. When Mail highlights the Cc field (the spot where you can send 
optional carbon copies of the message to additional recipients), you 
can type the addresses directly, use the contents of the Clipboard, or 
display the Addresses window.
 
 If you use the Addresses window, select the addresses that you want 
to use and click the Cc button. Then click the Close button on the 
Addresses window and press Tab.
 
 Looking for the Blind Carbon Copy (Bcc) field? To display it, choose 
View➪Bcc Address Field. (A blind carbon copy is a message sent to mul-
tiple recipients, just like a regular carbon copy, but the recipients aren’t 
listed when the message is displayed — that way, the other recipients 
don’t know who else got a copy of the message.) You can also click the 
small Field Display pop-up menu at the left side of the Subject field to 
toggle the display of the Bcc Address Field. Oh, and there’s also a Bcc 
button on the Addresses window — go figure.
 
4. In the Subject field, enter the subject of the message and then press Tab.
 
 Your text cursor now rests in the first line of the message text box — 
type, my friend, type like the wind! It’s considered good form to keep 
this line short and relatively to the point.
 
5. Click the Show Stationery button on the toolbar to display the 
Stationary strip above the message text box (as shown in Figure 2-7), 
where you can choose one of many backgrounds that Apple supplies.
 
 Stationery isn’t required, but it really packs a visual wallop! Double-click 
a thumbnail in the strip to add it to your message; to display a different 
category of stationery, such as a Greeting or Invitation, click the cat-
egory buttons on the left side of the Stationery strip.
 
 This one will really knock your socks off: If you choose a Photo stationery 
background for your new message, you can even drag an image from the 
Photo Browser, the iPhoto window, or a Finder window to fill the “place-
holder” images on the background. (Which, when you think about it, kind 
of makes sense . . . after all, why send an e-mail from sunny Italy that has 
stock photos of a strange couple at the top? Add your own travel shots 
instead!) Figure 2-7 illustrates a Photo stationery background.

 Not all e-mail applications on other computers correctly display a mes-
sage with a stationery background. For the whole scoop, see the “Hey, 
what does MIME mean?” sidebar, earlier in this chapter. Also, remember 
that a message with a stationery background is going to be much larger 
than a simple text message, especially if it contains a number of photos. 
(And, as you guessed, that also means that it takes longer to send and 
receive, which is very important for those using a dial-up analog modem 
connection.)
 
6. After you type your message, select any of the text that you’ve entered 
and use the toolbar features I describe in the earlier section “Replying 
to mail” to apply different fonts or formatting.
 
 Click the Fonts button in the message window toolbar to open a window 
of formatting choices. (Click its Close button to continue.) If you like 
menus, you can also click Format and make changes from there.
 
7. Add color to any selected text, if you like.
 
 Just click the Colors button in the message window toolbar and make 
choices in the Snow Leopard Color Picker that appears; when the hue is 
perfect, click the Close button on the Colors window to continue.
 
8. To add an attachment, click the Attach button on the toolbar, navigate 
to the to-be-attached file in the dialog that appears, select the file, and 
then click Open to add it to the message.
 
 Remember, if you’d like to include photos in your message, just click the 
Photo Browser toolbar button to select images from your iPhoto library, 
or take a photo with Photo Booth.

What? You Get Junk Mail, Too?
 
9. When your new message is ready to post, either click the Send button 
to immediately add the message to your Out folder or click the Save as 
Draft button to store it in your Drafts folder (without actually sending it).
To send a message held in your Drafts folder, click the Drafts folder in the 
Drawer to display all draft messages. Double-click the message that you want to 
send, which displays the message window (you can make edits at this point, if 
you like) and then click the Send button on the message window toolbar.
 
If you don’t have access to an Internet connection at the moment, Mail 
allows you to work offline. This way, you can read your unread messages 
and compose new ones on the road to send later. After you regain your 
Internet connection, you might need to choose Mailbox➪Go Online (depend-
ing on the connection type).
What? You Get Junk Mail, Too?
Spam — it’s the Crawling Crud of the Internet, and I hereby send out a 
lifetime of bad karma to those who spew it. However, chucking the First 
Amendment is not an option, so I guess we’ll always have junk mail. (Come 
to think of it, my paper mailbox is just as full of the stuff.)
Thankfully, Apple Mail has a net that you can cast to collect junk mail before 
you have to read it. The two methods of handling junk mail are
 
✦ Manually: You can mark any message in the message list as Junk Mail. 
Select the unwanted flotsam in the message list and then click the Junk 
button on the Mail window toolbar, which marks the message, as shown 
in Figure 2-8. (Ocean-front property in Kansas . . . yeah, right.) If a mes-
sage is mistakenly marked as junk but you actually want it, display the 
message in the preview box and then click the Not Junk button at the 
top of the preview box.
 
✦ Automatically: Apple Mail has a sophisticated Junk Mail filter that you 
actually train to better recognize what’s junk. (Keep reading to discover 
how.) After you train Mail to recognize spam with a high degree of accu-
racy, turn it to full Automatic mode, and it moves all those worthless 
messages to your Junk folder.
You customize and train the Junk Mail filter from the Preferences dialog 
(available from your trusty Mail menu); click Junk Mail to show the settings. 
I recommend that you first try Mail in Training mode, using the Mark as Junk 
Mail, But Leave It in My Inbox option. Junk Mail then takes its best shot at 
determining what’s junk. When you receive more mail and mark more mes-
sages as junk (or mark them as not junk), you’re actually teaching the Junk 
Mail feature how to winnow the wheat from the chaff. In Training mode, junk 
messages aren’t actually moved anywhere — they’re just marked with a par-
ticularly fitting, grungy brown color.

470
What? You Get Junk Mail, Too?
 
Figure 2-8: 
“Be gone, 
sludge 
demons of 
Junk Mail!”
 
After you’re satisfied that the Junk Mail filter is catching just about every-
thing that it can, display the Mail preferences again and choose the Move It 
to the Junk Mailbox option. Mail creates a Junk folder and prompts you for 
permission to move all junk messages to this folder. After you review every-
thing in the Junk folder, you can delete what it contains and send it to the 
Trash folder. To save a message from junkdom, click the Not Junk button in 
the preview window and then drag the message from the Junk folder mes-
sage list to the desired folder in the Drawer.
Finally, you can create a complete set of custom rules for your Junk Mail fil-
tering by clicking Perform Custom Actions — the Advanced button displays 
your Junk Mail rule set and allows you to edit your rules. I explain rules in 
more depth at the end of this chapter.
If you don’t receive a lot of spam — or you want to be absolutely sure that 
nothing gets labeled as junk until you review it — click the Enable Junk Mail 
Filtering check box to disable it. (And good luck.)
 
By default, Mail exempts certain messages from Junk Mail status based on 
three criteria: if the sender is in your Address Book, if you’ve sent the sender 
a message in the past, or if the message is addressed to you with your full 
name. To tighten up your Junk Mail filtering to the max, you might want to 
disable these check boxes as well.

Attachments on Parade
To reset the Junk Mail filter and erase any training that you’ve done, visit the 
Junk Mail settings in Preferences again and click Reset. Then click the Yes 
button to confirm your choice.
Attachments on Parade
Attachments are a fun way to transfer files through e-mail. However, it’s 
imperative that you remember these three very important caveats:
 
✦ Attachments can contain viruses. Even a message attachment that 
was actually sent by your best friend can contain a virus or malevolent 
macro — either because your friend unwittingly passed one along or 
because the virus actually took control of your friend’s e-mail applica-
tion and replicated itself automatically. (Ugh.)
 
✦ Corpulent attachments don’t make it. Most corporate and ISP mail serv-
ers have a 2–4MB limit for the total size of a message, and the attach-
ments (and any Photo stationery background you might have added) 
count toward that final message size. Therefore, I recommend sending a 
file as an attachment only if it’s less than 2MB (or perhaps 3MB) in size. 
If the recipient’s e-mail server sends you an automated message saying 
that the message was refused because it was too big, this is the problem.
 
✦ Not all e-mail applications and firewalls accept attachments. Not all 
e-mail programs support attachments in the same way, and others are 
simply set for pure text messages. Some corporate firewalls even reject 
messages with attachments. If the message recipient gets the message 
text but not the attachment, these are the likely reasons.
With all that said, it’s back to attachments as a beneficial feature. Follow 
these steps to save an attachment that you receive:
 
1. Click the message with an attachment in your message list.
 
 Having trouble determining which messages have attachments? Choose 
View➪Columns and then click the Attachments item from the submenu 
that appears to toggle it on. Now messages with attachments appear 
with a tiny paper-clip icon in the entry.
 
 If Mail recognizes the attachment format, it displays or plays the attach-
ment in the body of the message; if not, the attachment is displayed as a 
file icon.
 
2. To open an attachment that’s displayed as a file icon, click the file icon 
and then choose Open Attachment from the pop-up menu that appears.
 
 If you know what application should be used to open the attachment, 
click the Open With button and choose the correct application from the 
submenu that appears.

472
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
 
3. To save an attachment, right-click the attachment (however it appears in 
the message) and then choose Save Attachment from the pop-up menu.
 
 In the Save dialog that appears, navigate to the location where you want 
to save the file and then click Save.
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
As is all other Apple software, Mail is easily customized to your liking. In this 
section, I discuss some of the preferences that you might want to change.
Adding sound
To choose a sound that plays whenever you receive new mail, choose 
Mail➪Preferences and click the General button. Either click the New Messages 
Sound pop-up menu and choose one of the sounds that Apple provides or 
choose Add/Remove from the pop-up menu to choose a sound file from the 
Sounds folder (which, in turn, is located within your Library folder). Choose 
None from the pop-up menu to disable the new mail sound altogether.
Checking Mail automatically
By default, Mail automatically checks for new mail (and sends any mail in 
your Out folder) every five minutes. To change this delay period, display the 
General pane in the Preferences dialog, choose the Check for New Messages 
pop-up menu, and then choose one of the time periods. To disable automatic 
mail checking, choose Manually; you can click the Get Mail toolbar button to 
manually check your mail any time you like. (For example, those folks using 
dial-up analog modem connections may not fancy Mail taking control of the 
telephone line every 5 minutes.)
Automating junk mail and message deletion
If you like, Mail can be set to automatically delete sent mail and Junk mes-
sages (as well as permanently erase messages that you relegate to the 
Trash). To configure these settings, display the Accounts pane in the 
Preferences window, click the desired account, and then click the Mailboxes 
Behaviors tab.
To delete Sent messages automatically, click the Delete Sent Messages When 
pop-up menu and choose the delay period or action. You can choose to 
delete mail after a day, a week, a month, or immediately upon quitting Mail. 
Alternatively, you can leave this field set to Never, and Mail never automati-
cally deletes any messages from the Sent folder.
To delete Junk messages automatically, click the Delete Junk Messages 
When pop-up menu and choose the delay period or action. (They’re the 
same as the options available for Sent mail.)

Book V
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
473
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
To delete messages from the Trash, click the Permanently Erase Deleted 
Messages When pop-up menu and choose the delay period or action — 
again, the choices are the same as those for Sent messages.
Adding signatures
To add a block of text or a graphic to the bottom of your messages as your 
personal signature, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences and click the Signatures button.
 
2. From the Signatures pane that appears, click the Add Signature button 
(which carries a plus sign).
 
3. Click the signature name to open an edit box and then type an identi-
fying name.
 
  Press Return to save the new name.
 
4. Click inside the text entry box at the right to move the cursor.
 
5. Type the signature itself in the text entry box or copy the signature to 
the Clipboard and paste it into the text entry box.
 
 Because downloading a graphic in a signature takes longer — and 
because some folks still use plain-text e-mail — avoid the temptation to 
include graphics in your signature.
 
6. If you have multiple signatures, click the Choose Signature pop-up 
menu to choose which one you want to use or to use them all ran-
domly or in sequence.
If you prefer the signature to appear above the quoted text in a reply, select 
the Place Signature above Quoted Text check box.
Changing the status of an account
Sometimes you can’t reach one of your accounts. For example, maybe you’re 
on the road with your laptop and you can’t access your office network. 
Apple Mail allows you to enable and disable specific accounts without the 
hassle of deleting an account and then having to add it again.
To disable or enable an account, open the Preferences dialog, click the 
Accounts button, click the desired account, click the Advanced tab, and then 
select (or deselect) the Enable This Account check box as necessary.
 
If you disable an account, you should also deselect the Include When 
Automatically Checking for New Mail check box to make sure that Mail 
doesn’t display an error message. You can always check any account for 
new mail by choosing Mailbox➪Get New Mail and then choosing the desired 
account name from the submenu.

474
Automating Your Mail with Rules
Automating Your Mail with Rules
Before I leave the beautiful shores of Mail Island, I’d be remiss if I didn’t dis-
cuss one of its most powerful features: the ability to create rules, which are 
automated actions that Mail can take. With rules, you can specify criteria 
that can perform actions such as
 
✦ Transferring messages from one folder to another
 
✦ Forwarding messages to another address
 
✦ Highlighting or deleting messages
To set up a rule, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences and then click the Rules button on the toolbar.
 
 Mail displays the Rules pane.
 
2. To duplicate an existing rule, highlight it in the list and then click the 
Duplicate button. (For this demonstration, however, create a rule from 
scratch by clicking the Add Rule button.)
 
3. In the Description field, type a descriptive name for the new rule and 
then press Tab to move to the next field.
 
4. Click the If pop-up menu to specify whether the rule is triggered if any 
of the conditions are met or if all conditions must be met.
 
5. Because each rule requires at least one condition, click the target 
pop-up menus to set the target for the condition.
 
 These include whom the message is from or to, which account received 
the message, whether the message is marked as junk, and whether the 
message contains certain content. Select the target for the condition.
 
6. Click the Criteria pop-up menu to choose the rule’s criteria.
 
 The contents of this pop-up menu change depending on the condition’s 
target. For example, if you choose From as the target, the criteria 
include Contains, Does Not Contain, Begins With, and so forth.
 
7. Click in the expression box and type the text to use for the condition.
 
 For example, a completed condition might read
Subject Contains Ocean-Front
 
 This particular condition is true if I get an e-mail message with a subject 
that contains the string Ocean-Front.
 
8. Add more conditions by clicking the plus sign button at the right of 
the first condition.
 
 To remove any condition from this rule, click the minus sign button next 
to it. Remember, however, that every rule needs at least one condition.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
475
Automating Your Mail with Rules
 
9. To specify what action is taken after the condition (or conditions) is 
met, click the first Perform the Following Actions pop-up menu to see 
the action that this rule should perform. Then click the second pop-up 
menu and select the action for the rule.
 
 Choices include transferring a message from one folder to another, 
playing a sound, automatically forwarding the message, deleting it, and 
marking it as read.
 
 Each rule requires at least one action.
 
10. Depending on the action that you select, specify one or more criteria 
for the action.
 
 For instance, if I select Set Color as my action, I must then choose 
whether to color the text or the background as well as what color to use.
 
 As with the plus button next to the conditions, you can also click the 
plus button next to the first action to perform more than one action. To 
remove an action, click the minus button next to it.
 11. When the rule is complete, click OK to save it.
 
 Here’s an example of a complex rule:
 
 If the message was sent by someone in my Address Book and the Subject 
field contains the text FORWARD ME, forward the message to the e-mail 
address fuadramses@me.com.
This is a good example of an automated forwarding rule. With this rule in 
place and Mail running on Mac OS X, any of my friends, family, or co-workers 
can forward urgent e-mail to my MobileMe account while I’m on vacation. To 
trigger the rule, all the sender has to do is include the words FORWARD ME 
in the message subject. And if the sender isn’t in my Address Book, the rule 
doesn’t trigger, and I can read the message when I get home. Mondo sassy.
Each rule in the Rules dialog can be enabled or disabled by toggling the 
Active check box next to the rule. You can also edit a rule by selecting it in 
the Rules pane and then clicking the Edit button. To delete a rule completely 
from the list, select it and then click the Remove button; Mail prompts you 
for confirmation before the deed is done.
If you decide to create a custom Junk mail processing rule, the process is the 
same, but you get to it from a different place. Click the Junk Mail button on 
the Preferences dialog toolbar and click the Perform Custom Actions radio 
button to select it. You see that the Advanced button is now enabled — click 
it and you can set up the custom Junk mail rules that handle stuff from any 
conceivable junk mail source!

T
hroughout humankind’s history, our drive has been toward communica-
tion — from the earliest cave paintings, through written language, to 
the telegraph, telephone, and cell phone all-in-one PDA that the guy in the 
SUV in front of you is using . . . and he’s arguing with someone and he’s not 
paying attention and . . . (whump).
So much for the scholarly introduction — anyway, forget that silly cellular 
phone and your complicated calling plan! As long as you have Mac OS X 
and an Internet connection, you can instantly chat with your friends and 
family whether they’re across the aisle in another cube or halfway across 
the world. And, by golly, if you both have an iSight camera, Web camera, or 
digital video (DV) camcorder connected to your computers, you’ll see each 
other in glorious, full-color video! This modern marvel is iChat, and it fulfills 
the decades-old promise of the video telephone quite well, thank you.
In this chapter, I show you how to gab with the following folks:
 
✦ Others who use iChat (either on your local network or on the Internet)
 
✦ Anyone who uses AIM — that’s short for America Online (AOL) Instant 
Messaging — MobileMe, Jabber, or Google Talk
 
✦ Folks who participate in AOL chat rooms

478
Configuring iChat
Configuring iChat
When you first run iChat (by clicking the iChat icon in the Dock), you’re 
prompted to create an iChat account. Type the first name (your name) that 
you want to use in the First Name field, press Tab, and then type the sur-
name that you want to use. (Yes, you can even use Bullwinkle Moose — just 
leave out the middle initial J.)
 
By default, iChat uses the MobileMe account that you set up when you first 
installed Mac OS X. In this case, your MobileMe account name and password 
are entered automatically for you, and you’re good to go. However, if you’re 
already using AIM, Jabber, or Google Talk and you want to use your existing 
account, click the Account Type pop-up menu and choose the correct type; 
then enter your existing account name and password instead.
iChat will also set up Bonjour messaging automatically. Think of Bonjour 
as plug-and-play for your local network. In iChat, Bonjour messaging dis-
plays a separate window in which you can see (and yak with) anyone on 
your local network without having to know his iChat name. That’s because 
Bonjour automatically announces all the iChat users who are available on 
your network. If you have others using iChat, Jabber, or AIM on your local 
network, go for this option; if you’re not connected to a local network, how-
ever, Bonjour messaging isn’t necessary. Also, if you’re on a public AirPort/
AirPort Extreme network or if you’re connecting to the Internet with a 
modem through dial-up, I recommend disabling Bonjour messaging. (For all 
that’s cool about AirPort and its faster sibling AirPort Extreme, see Book VI, 
Chapter 3.)
After you finish these configuration necessities, iChat displays the Buddy 
List window (or, if you’re using Bonjour messaging, the two windows) that 
you see in Figure 3-1. Remember that your Bonjour window displays only 
those iChat folks on your local network.
A few things to note here about the Buddy List window:
 
✦ If you don’t like your picture, don’t panic. By default, iChat uses your 
user account thumbnail image as your visual persona. However, you can 
add a picture to your iChat iDentity — sorry, I couldn’t resist that — by 
dragging an image to the well next to your name at the top of the Buddy 
List window. If necessary, iChat asks you to position and size the image 
so that it fits in the (admittedly limited) space. This picture is then sent 
along with your words when you chat. In the figures for this chapter, I 
borrow the smiling face of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
 
 Click your image to display your recent thumbnails. This way, you can 
even use a different thumbnail image for each of your many moods. 
(Geez.) Also, you can click Edit Picture from the pop-up menu and cap-
ture a new thumbnail with your iSight camera.

✦ Check out the buttons along the bottom of the Buddy List window. In 
order, these buttons are
 
• Add a New Buddy (which I cover in the following section)
 
• Start a Text Chat (plain, old-fashioned chatting via the keyboard)
 
• Start an Audio Chat (chatting with your voice, using microphones)
 
• Start a Video Chat (the ultimate chat, where the parties can both see 
and hear each other)
 
• Start Screen Sharing (where you can view — or even remotely control — 
a Buddy’s computer)
 
 Using these buttons can handle about 90 percent of the commands that 
you need to give while using iChat, so use ’em! (Note that the Bonjour 
window doesn’t have an Add a New Buddy button because the Buddy 
list in the Bonjour window is populated automatically by other iChat 
folks on your local network.)

Changing Modes in iChat
 
✦ Hey, look, there’s an iChat menu bar icon! When you’re running iChat, 
you can choose to add a balloon menu bar icon in the upper-right corner 
of your screen. Click it to display the options that you see in Figure 3-2. 
You can change your online/offline status, immediately invite a Buddy for 
a chat, or display the Buddy list (which I discuss later in the section, “Will 
You Be My Buddy?”). The menu bar icon appears only if you enable the 
Show Status in Menu Bar check box. Click iChat in the menu and choose 
Preferences; then click the General button in the Preference dialog.

Changing Modes in iChat
To launch iChat, you can click its icon from the Dock or launch it from its 
iChat application icon (which you find in your Applications folder). Or, you 
can click its menu bar icon, which is grayed out when you’re offline. If you’re 
not already familiar with the terms online and offline, here’s the scoop: When 
you’re online, folks can invite you to chat and communicate with you. When 
you’re offline, you’re disconnected: iChat isn’t active, you can’t be paged, 
and you can’t chat.

Will You Be My Buddy?
Even when you’re offline, you can choose Available from the friendly balloon 
Finder menu bar icon, which automatically switches iChat to online mode. 
Or you can click a Buddy name directly, which automatically switches iChat 
to online mode and opens the paging window for that Buddy. (Naturally, you 
have to have the proper network or Internet connection first.)
You can use another mode, Away, whenever iChat is running and you’re still 
online but not available. For example, if I’m away from my Mac for a few min-
utes, I leave iChat running, but I switch myself to Away mode. My Buddies get 
a message saying that I’m Away, so they won’t bother trying to contact me. 
When I return to my computer, I simply move my mouse, and iChat intelli-
gently inquires as to whether I’d like to return to Available mode. You can also 
use the menu bar icon to switch from Away to Available (or my other favorite 
mode, Twiddling My Thumbs). Refer to Figure 3-2 to see these choices.
 
iChat can even display the iTunes song you’re listening to at the moment. 
Pick Current iTunes Song from the menu and impress your friends with your 
digital audio techno-powers.
Speaking of modes, you, too, can create a custom mode — like Bored stiff! 
or Listening to the Pointy-Haired Boss — and use it instead of the somewhat 
mundane choices of Available and Away. To do this, display the Buddy List 
window, click the word Available beneath your name (refer to Figure 3-2), 
and a pop-up menu appears. Click Custom Available or Custom Away to 
create your new mode. An edit box appears, in which you can type the new 
mode; press Return to automatically add the newcomer to your mode list. 
You can also switch modes from this pop-up menu.
To choose an existing mode, click it; modes with a green bullet are online 
modes, and red bullet modes are offline modes. (Apple provides you with 
some starting choices, like Surfing the Web for Available and In a Meeting 
for Away.) Notice in Figure 3-2 that I created a custom mode called Getting 
Another Diet Coke . . . cAfFeInE fills my life.
Will You Be My Buddy?
I know that question sounds a little personal, but in iChat, a Buddy is anyone 
whom you want to chat with, whether the topic is work related or your per-
sonal life. iChat keeps track of your Buddies in the Buddy list. You can also 
add them to your Address Book or use the AIM entry in an Address Book 
contact to generate a new Buddy identity.

482
Will You Be My Buddy?
To add a new Buddy, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Buddies➪Add Buddy, or click the Add Buddy button at the 
bottom of the iChat window and click Add Buddy from the pop-up 
menu, or press Ô+Shift+A.
 
2. To create a Buddy entry from an Address Book contact who has an 
Instant Messaging username, click the down-arrow button next to the 
Last Name box to display the Address Book list. Click the entry to 
select it.
 
 As a shortcut, you can also click in the First Name box and then type the 
person’s first name or click in the Account Name box and type the per-
son’s Instant Messaging account name.
 
3. To add a brand-new person who’s not already in your Address Book, 
type the person’s Instant Messaging account name and click the pop-up 
menu to select the proper account type (either MobileMe or AIM).
 
4. Click Add to save the Buddy information.
 
Even when you add a new Buddy and that name appears in the Buddy list, 
don’t be surprised if the name actually fades out after a few seconds — that 
indicates that the person is offline and unavailable. You can also tell when a 
person is available if her name appears with a green bullet in the Buddy list.
You can also specify a number of actions that iChat should take if a Buddy 
logs in or out of Instant Messaging, or if a Buddy changes his or her status 
to Available. To display these actions, click the desired Buddy’s entry in 
your Buddy list and then press Ô+Shift+I. Click the Actions button and then 
choose the event that should trigger the action from the Event pop-up menu. 
Select the desired check box to specify whether iChat should play the sound 
that you select, run an AppleScript, or animate the iChat icon by “bouncing” 
it in the Dock.
Click the Address Card button on the Info dialog to enter or edit the person’s
 
✦ Real name
 
✦ Nickname
 
✦ E-mail
 
✦ Buddy icon
iChat obligingly creates an entry in your Address Book for your new Buddy. 
(Apple, you truly rock.)

Chat! Chat, I Say!
Chat! Chat, I Say!
Turn your attention to getting the attention of others — through inviting 
others to chat. Good chatting etiquette implies inviting someone to a conver-
sation rather than barging in unannounced.
If you want to join an AIM chat already in progress, choose File➪Go to Chat 
Room (or press Ô+Control+G). Depending on the service being used, you 
might have to specify both the type of chat and the specific chat room name.
At this point, it’s time to draw your attention to the green phone and video 
icons next to each person in your Buddy list (as well as next to your own 
name at the top of the list). If the green phone icon appears next to both 
your name and your Buddy’s name, you can enjoy a two-way audio (or 
voice) chat. If both you and your Buddy (or Buddies) are lucky enough to 
have iSight or DV cameras connected to your Macs, you can jump into a real-
time, two-way video chat room, complete with audio. Time for a very impor-
tant Mark’s Maxim that’s violated a surprising number of times:
Always wear a shirt while chatting with video, no matter your impres-
sive physique. Always.
If your Mac has a microphone or video camera hooked up but you don’t 
see these icons, click the Video menu and make sure that the Microphone 
Enabled and Camera Enabled menu items are selected.
To invite someone, click the desired Buddy from the Buddy list, click 
Buddies, and then choose Invite to Chat. (If your pointing thing has two but-
tons, right-click — or Control-click — the Buddy in the list and click Invite to 
Chat.) You can also click directly on the phone or camera icon next to the 
person’s name in your Buddy list. iChat displays the Group Chat window 
that you see in Figure 3-3, which also doubles as an Invitation window.
 
You can invite additional Buddies to enter the chat by clicking the plus 
button at the bottom left of the Participants list and choosing another 
Buddy. If the Participants list isn’t visible, click the View menu and choose 
Show Chat Participants.
Type your invitation text into the entry box at the bottom of the window. If 
you want to use bold or italic text, highlight the text and press Ô+B for Bold 
(B) or Ô+I for Italic (I). You can also add a Smiley (often called an emoticon) 
to your invitation text: Click in the desired spot in the text, click the Smiley 
button to the right of the text entry field, and then choose the proper Smiley 
from the list. To send the invitation text, press Return.

The recipient of your chat invitation can decline or accept your chat invita-
tion. You’re notified (as delicately as possible) if the chat has been declined.
To invite a Buddy to an audio chat, select that person in the Buddy list, click 
the Buddies menu, and then choose Invite to Audio Chat (or One-Way Audio 
Chat, if only one of you has a microphone). A video invitation works in a sim-
ilar fashion: Click Buddies and choose either Invite to Video Chat or Invite to 
One-Way Video Chat, depending on the hardware available. (Need I mention 
that you can just right-click [or Control-click] the person in your Buddy list 
and choose these commands from the pop-up menu that appears?)
If the chat is accepted, iChat displays a message saying that the Buddy whom 
you invited has joined the chat, and you now can begin the chat. You don’t 
have to alternate sending messages back and forth between participants — 
everyone in a chat can compose and send messages at the same time — 
but I personally like to alternate when I’m chatting one on one. By the way, 
you might notice that AIM users are represented by the AIM Running Dude 
icon (unless AOL changes it, or you assign an icon picture of your own, as I 
describe in the “Configuring iChat” section, earlier in the chapter).
If someone invites you to a chat, you get the opposite side of the coin: 
A prompt dialog appears, and you can choose to accept or decline the 
invitation. (If it’s a video chat, you even get a video preview of the person 
inviting you.)
 
You can resize the Chat window by using the handle at the bottom-right 
corner, just as you can most other application windows in Mac OS X.

You can also change fonts and colors while composing a line of text. Simply 
select the text and then choose Format➪Show Fonts or Format➪Show Colors 
(or press Ô+T or Ô+Shift+C) to display the Fonts and Colors windows, respec-
tively. These windows can be resized and moved wherever you like.
 
To save the discussion in a chat, choose File➪Save a Copy As. In the dialog 
that appears, type a name for the chat file, select a location where you want 
to store the file, and then click Save. To automatically save transcripts of 
all your chats, choose iChat➪Preferences and click Messages; then select 
the Automatically Save Chat Transcripts To check box. By default, the tran-
scripts are saved in an iChat folder that’s created inside your Documents 
folder in your Home folder. You can, however, click the pop-up menu to 
choose another location if you like.
When the iChat window is active, a number of display choices can be made 
from the View menu. Click the Messages item in the View menu to display 
these options, including
 
✦ Show as Text: Each line that you write and receive in a chat can be dis-
played in balloons, just like your favorite comic — the default — or as 
simple text. You can also choose to display text lines in the more tradi-
tional boxes or as compact text (allowing more room for more charac-
ters in the iChat window).
 
✦ Show Names and Pictures: Each line can be displayed with the individu-
al’s picture, just the name, or both the name and picture.
If you’re tired of the default background for the chat window, click View and 
choose the Set Chat Background menu item to choose a graphic to use for 
the Chat window. To return to the original appearance, choose the Clear 
Background menu item.
Sending SMS messages and e-mail within iChat
iChat doesn’t limit you to just a chat between 
computers! Choose File➪Send SMS and you 
can hold an SMS (Short Message Service) 
conversation with anyone using a digital mobile 
phone. iChat prompts you for the mobile-phone 
number, and the connection is made automati-
cally. The SMS chat window looks just like the 
standard iChat text chat window. (Need I warn 
you that the charge for text messaging can bank-
rupt an unsuspecting teenager in an hour?)
You can also choose to ship off an e-mail mes-
sage from within iChat. Click a person in the 
Buddy list and click the Buddies menu; then click 
Send Email to automatically launch Apple Mail.

486
Sharing Screens and iChat Theater
 
Click the Buddy list, and the View menu offers a different set of controls: You 
can sort your Buddy list by first name, last name, or availability; you can 
also toggle the display of offline Buddies. These options are also available 
from the Buddy List window toolbar.
 
Curious about the capabilities of your Mac hardware in iChat? Choose Video➪
Connection Doctor, where you can view statistics and information about your 
current chat, display the features of iChat that are supported by your Mac, 
and view any error messages that are generated by iChat during this session.
To close a chat, click the Close button on the Chat window.
Sharing Screens and iChat Theater
How often have you wanted to show someone a neat new application, or 
lead your Aunt Mildred through the paces of setting up an Apple TV connec-
tion on her system? That’s the idea behind the ultimate collaboration tool, 
sharing screens, where you can watch (or even remotely control) the display 
on another person’s Mac — across any broadband Internet or local network 
connection!
Screen sharing must be turned on for you to send or receive sharing invites. 
Choose Video➪Screen Sharing Enabled — a check mark appears next to the 
menu item when the feature is enabled.
If a Buddy invites you to share a screen, you receive a prompt that lets you 
accept or decline. If you accept the sharing invitation, iChat automatically 
initiates an audio chat (so that you can gab away to each other while things 
are happening on-screen). Suddenly, you’re seeing the Desktop and applica-
tions that your Buddy is running, and you can both control the cursor and 
left- or right-click the mouse.
Throughout the screen-sharing session, iChat maintains a semi-opaque panel 
on your screen that has three buttons:
 
✦ End the Shared Screen Session: Click this button to exit shared screen 
mode.
 
✦ Switch Desktops: Click this button to swap between your Mac’s screen 
and the remote Mac’s screen. (Those Mac owners who have enabled 
Fast User Switching will recognize the cool screen swap animation.)
 
✦ Mute Audio: Click this button to mute the audio during the screen-sharing 
session.
To invite a Buddy to share your screen, choose Buddies➪Share My Screen.

Sending Files with iChat
 
Okay, if sharing a screen with someone you don’t absolutely know and trust 
doesn’t set off alarm bells in your cranium, it should. Remember, anyone 
with shared screen access can perform most of the same actions as you can, 
just as if that person were sitting in front of your Mac. Granted, most of the 
truly devastating things would require you to type your admin password, 
but a malicious individual could still delete files or wreak havoc any number 
of ways on your system. Be careful with whom you share your screen!
But wait . . . What if you don’t want to control Aunt Mildred’s Mac? Perhaps 
you just want to share a document instead? For example, you could show off 
some photos or a movie you’ve just finished. That’s the idea behind iChat 
Theater, where you can share a document or video and hold a conversation 
while viewing the content! iChat Theater falls in between Screen Sharing and 
a simple file download, which I cover in the next section.
To select one or more items for your Theater show, choose File➪ Share 
iPhoto with iChat Theater (to share images from your iPhoto library) or 
File➪Share a File with iChat Theater (to share movies and other documents). 
iChat displays a standard Open dialog, in which you can select one or more 
items. When you’re ready to begin your Theater presentation, click Share. If 
you’re using a video camera, your video appears as a thumbnail, while your 
content gets center stage.
 
iChat Theater works with anything that can be displayed in Quick Look or 
located with Spotlight, including slideshows from iPhoto, a Keynote presen-
tation, or a QuickTime movie.
Sending Files with iChat
To send a file to a Buddy, click the desired entry in the Buddy list and then 
choose Buddies➪Send File. Alternatively, you can use the Ô+Option+F key-
board shortcut; right-click and choose Send a File; drag the file from a Finder 
window to the person’s entry in the Buddy list; or even drag the file into 
the text typing window. (How’s that for convenience?) A dialog appears to 
indicate that the recipient is being offered a file transfer request. If the file 
transfer request is accepted by your Buddy, the transfer begins and is saved 
where the recipient specifies on her system.
If a Buddy sends you a file, the Incoming File Request pane appears. You can 
then either click the Decline button (to decline the file transfer) or the Save 
File button (to save the incoming file to any spot on your system).
 
Always check any files that you receive from iChat with your antivirus scan-
ning software before you run them!

Eliminating the Riffraff
Eliminating the Riffraff
Here I need to explain something that I hope you won’t have to use — what 
I like to call the Turkey Filter. (iChat is a little more subtle — you just ignore 
people.)
To ignore someone in a chat group, click her name in the list and choose 
Buddies➪Ignore <person>. When someone is ignored in a chat group, you 
don’t see anything that she types or have to respond to any file transfer 
requests from that person.
If only it were that easy to ignore someone when he’s standing close to you.
Anyway, if the person becomes a royal pain, you can also choose to block 
that person entirely. That way, the offensive cur doesn’t even know that 
you’re online, and he can’t reach you at all. Click the person in the list and 
choose Buddies➪Block <person> — the deed is done.
Adding Visual Effects
Our esteemed Apple software developers decided to bring a little Hollywood 
special effects “flash” to iChat with video backdrops. You can also use many 
of the special effects filters provided by Photo Booth to keep your video 
chat room laughing!
To add a video backdrop to your video feed, choose Video➪Video Preview 
to display your stunning self in a live video feed; then choose Video➪Show 
Video Effects. Use the scroll buttons to move to the backdrop thumbnails 
toward the end of the Effects library. When you click one, iChat prompts 
you to leave the frame for a few seconds so that the plain background 
behind you can be correctly “masked” (just like those blockbuster special 
effects used in today’s films). When your background has been captured and 
masked, iChat prompts you to return to your spot, and you’ll see that your 
new static or animated backdrop is in place. Just plain cool!
 
The plainer the background behind you, the better iChat can process and 
mask your background. A plain wall painted a single color works best.
“But, Mark, I want my own movies and photos for backgrounds!” No problem — 
you’ll notice that iChat provides six user-defined backdrop slots for your own 
selections at the end of the Video Effects collection. (Click the right scroll arrow 
in the Video Effects window until you reach the last couple of pages.) To add 
your own visuals, you can

✦ Drag a photo from iPhoto to an empty User Backdrop well in the Video

✦ Drag a video or photo from a Finder window to an empty User Backdrop 
well in the Video Effects window.
 
As long as an item can be displayed in Quick Look, it can be used as a video 
background. Think of the possibilities!
To try out a Photo Booth effect in iChat, choose Video➪Video Preview to 
display your live video feed; then choose Video➪Show Video Effects (or 
press Ô+Shift+E). Figure 3-4 illustrates the Video Preview and Video Effects 
windows; click a video effect thumbnail to see how it looks on you in the 
Preview window! Effects range from simple Black & White to a Thermal 
Camera look, an Andy Warhol–style Pop Art display, and a number of really 
cool optical distortions (such as Twirl and Light Tunnel).

After you find just the right video effect, close the two windows and start chat-

Book V: The Typical Internet Stuff

Chapter 4: Expanding Your 
Horizons with iDisk
In This Chapter
✓ Setting up iDisk
✓ Using files and folders on your iDisk
✓ Using public files
I
f you ask the average Mac owner about what’s available on the Internet, 
you likely hear benefits, such as e-mail, Web surfing, RSS feeds, 
Google, and instant communication via iChat. What you may not hear is 
“Convenient, trouble-free storage for my files and folders.”
You might have tried to use one of the dozens of storage sites on the 
Internet that allows you to upload and download files from a personal file 
area via your Web browser. Unfortunately, these Web-based storage sites 
are slow in transferring files and lacking in convenience, and they typically 
offer only a small amount of space. As a result, most computer owners 
decide that the idea of online storage is neat . . . but impractical.
In this chapter, I show you what real online storage is all about. I’m talking 
about iDisk, which is the online storage feature that’s integrated into the 
Mac OS X Finder. No jury-rigged Web site is necessary (although you can 
use one if you’re not on a Mac running Snow Leopard). I admit that online 
storage doesn’t replace the hard drives on your Mac, but with a MobileMe 
subscription, you can easily make use of online storage for backups and 
sharing files with your friends . . . from anywhere on the planet!
So how do you actually use iDisk? That’s the simple part! To use iDisk within 
Mac OS X, just do what comes naturally — it works the same as any other 
removable volume’s Finder window. You can copy and move files and fold-
ers to and from your iDisk, create new subfolders (except in the Backup, 
Library, and Software root folders, which are read-only), and delete what-
ever you don’t need.

492
Grabbing Internet Storage for Your Mac
Grabbing Internet Storage for Your Mac
To set up iDisk on your Mac OS X system, you need a MobileMe account. 
You did create one during the installation of the Big X, right? These trial 
accounts are active for 60 days. To subscribe, visit www.me.com and follow 
the prompts to join from there. (At the time of this writing, the subscription 
fee for an individual account is $99 per year from Apple (however, Amazon.
com sells MobileMe subscriptions for significantly less). You need a credit 
card to create a MobileMe account, but you can cancel your trial account at 
any time.)
Here’s a bit of good news: Other than the 60-day limit, there’s almost no dif-
ference between a MobileMe trial account and a full, $99 yearly subscription, 
so you can try out all the MobileMe features, exactly as though you were 
already paying for them. Sweet!
With a MobileMe account active, iDisk is available automatically. To see how 
much storage you’re using and to configure access to your Public folder, 
open System Preferences, click the MobileMe icon, and then click the iDisk 
button to display the settings that you see in Figure 4-1. (You can also click 
the Upgrade Storage button on this pane to subscribe to MobileMe, or if 
you’re already a MobileMe subscriber, add storage space.)

settings are

Prefer-
ences.
 
The iDisk Disk Space bar graph illustrates how much of your current iDisk 
territory you’re using.
You can specify the access privilege level for other MobileMe users from 
this pane as well. Select the Read Only radio button to prevent any other

MobileMe user from copying files to your Public folder, or select the Read & 
Write radio button to allow others to save files there.
No matter which privilege level you choose, you can also set a password 
that other MobileMe users must type before they’re allowed access to your 
Public folder. This is the very definition of A Truly Good Idea. (More on the 
Public folder in the next section.)
 
If you’ve already set a password, you can change it by clicking the Set 
Password button and typing the new word in the Password box. Retype the 
word in the Confirm box to verify it; then click OK to save the change and 
return to the MobileMe System Preferences pane.
Pinning down your iDisk
So where exactly are your files kept when 
you use your iDisk? In earlier versions of Mac 
OS X, your acre of storage farmland always 
sat exclusively on one of Apple’s iDisk file 
servers — perhaps in Cupertino, perhaps else-
where. These server computers are especially 
designed to store terabytes (TB) of information 
(1TB equals 1,000GB), and they’re connected 
to the Internet via high-speed trunk lines. (And 
yes, they do have a firewall.) Your Internet 
copy of your iDisk is still stored on an Apple 
file server.
However, you can elect to keep a local copy 
of your iDisk storage area — usually called 
a mirror — on your Mac’s hard drive. Before 
you scratch your head wondering why you’re 
duplicating your iDisk files on your computer, 
here’s the reason: If you do decide to keep 
a local copy of your files, you can work on 
them even when you’re not connected to the 
Internet! Snow Leopard automatically synchro-
nizes any files that you’ve updated locally with 
your remote iDisk whenever you connect to the 
Internet. (If you use multiple Macs at different 
locations, think about being able to access the 
latest copies of your files from any of them, right 
from the Finder!)
This nifty mirror also greatly speeds up things 
when you’re browsing the contents of your 
iDisk or perhaps loading and saving an iDisk 
document; that’s because you’re working with 
your local copy, and Mac OS X updates any 
changes that you make to the corresponding 
remote file on the iDisk server. You can tell 
that things are updating when that funky little 
yin-yang, circular doodad — the thing next to 
your iDisk in the Finder window — is rotating 
in its animated fashion. (And yes, I have it on 
good authority: That’s what the Apple software 
developers call it, too.)
You’re not required to use a mirror, however. 
To disable the mirroring feature and return 
to the remote-only operation of old, click the 
iDisk Syncing Stop button on the iDisk panel in 
System Preferences to turn it off. Remember, 
though, that with the mirroring feature turned 
off, you must have an Internet connection to 
use iDisk, and things will move more slowly 
because you’re accessing everything across 
the Internet.

Understanding What’s on Your iDisk
Understanding What’s on Your iDisk
In contrast to the physical hard drive in your Mac, your iDisk never needs 
formatting or defragmenting, and you never have to check it for errors. 
However, the structure of an iDisk is fixed, so you can’t just go crazy creat-
ing your own folders. In fact, you can’t create new folders at the root — the 
top level — of your iDisk at all, but you can create new folders inside most 
of the root folders.
Now that you’re thoroughly rooterized, here are the folders that you find 
hanging out in your iDisk:
 
✦ Backup: This is a read-only folder that contains the backup files created 
with the MobileMe Backup application. You can, however, copy the files 
in this folder to a removable drive on your system for an additional level 
of safekeeping.
 
✦ Documents: This folder holds any application documents that you want 
to store — things like spreadsheets and letters. No one but you can 
access these items.
 
✦ Groups: This folder holds files that you want to share with others in any 
MobileMe Groups you might have joined.
 
✦ Library: Another read-only folder. This spot contains the configuration 
data and custom settings that you’ve created for other MobileMe features.
 
✦ Movies: QuickTime movies go here — again, you can add the movies 
stored here to your Web pages. (I cover QuickTime like a blanket in 
Book III, Chapter 8.)
 
✦ Music: This is the repository for all your iTunes music and playlists, and the 
contents can be added to your Web pages. (iTunes is the star of Chapter 2 
in Book III.) Mine is stuffed full of Mozart, Scarlatti, and that Bach fellow.
 
✦ Pictures: This folder is the vault for your JPEG and GIF images, including 
those that you want to use with your Web pages.
 
✦ Public: This is the spot to place files that you specifically want to share 
with others, either directly through iDisk or with your Web pages. If you’ve 
allowed write access, others can copy files to your Public folder as well.
 
✦ Sites: The Web pages that you store here can be created with iWeb, 
which I cover in Book III, Chapter 7. In fact, you can even use your own 
Web page design application and copy the completed site files here.
 
✦ Software: Apple provides this read-only folder as a service to MobileMe 
members; it contains a selection of the latest freeware, shareware, and com-
mercial demos for you to enjoy. To try something out, open the Software 
folder and copy whatever you like to your Mac OS X Desktop. Then you can 
install and run the application from the local copy of the files.
 
✦ Web: This folder holds your MobileMe Galleries created from within 
iPhoto, as well as other media used by iWeb.

Opening and Using iDisk
Opening and Using iDisk
When you’re connected to the Internet, you can open your iDisk in one of 
the following ways:
 
✦ From the Finder menu, choose Go➪iDisk and then choose My iDisk 
from the submenu or use the Ô+Shift+I keyboard shortcut.
 
✦ Click the iDisk icon in the Finder Sidebar.
 
✦ Add an iDisk button to your Finder window toolbar by choosing 
View➪Customize Toolbar.
 
 After you add the button, you can click it to connect to your iDisk from 
anywhere in the Finder.
Your iDisk opens in a new Finder window. After you use one of these methods 
in a Mac OS X session, your iDisk icon appears on the Mac OS X Desktop; 
Figure 4-2 shows the iDisk contents in a Finder window. The iDisk volume 
icon remains until you shut down or restart your Mac. (Alternatively, you can 
dismiss the iDisk volume icon from your Desktop using the same method by 
which you eject an external drive: Click the iDisk icon and press Ô+E or click 
the Eject button next to the iDisk icon in the Finder window Sidebar.)
 
Figure 4-2: 
The contents 
of your 
iDisk — 
pretty iNeat, 
I’m thinking.
 
 
If you’re using a remote computer with an Internet connection, you can 
log in to the MobileMe page at www.me.com and use your Web browser to 
access the contents of your iDisk. (Hey, sometimes this is the only choice 
you have.)
However, you don’t actually need to open your iDisk in a Finder window to 
use it, because you can also load and save files directly to your iDisk from 
within any application. Simply choose your iDisk as you would any of the 
hard drives on your system when using the application’s Open, Save, or Save 
As commands.

496
Opening and Using iDisk
You can also open an iDisk Public folder — either yours or the Public folder 
inside another person’s iDisk — as if it were an Internet file server. As I 
explain earlier in the chapter, if that person has set a password, you need 
to enter that password to gain access to all of his or her iDisk folders. From 
the Finder menu, choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s iDisk (or, to jump directly 
to their Public folder, choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s Public Folder). If 
you choose the former, Snow Leopard prompts you for the other person’s 
member name and password; if you pick the latter, you need only enter the 
other MobileMe member’s account name.
After you enter a valid iDisk member name (and password, if required), you 
see the MobileMe member’s Public folder.
 
You can also use the server address
http://idisk.me.com/username-Public?
to connect to an iDisk from computers running Windows and Linux. Check 
the Help for your operating system to determine how to connect to a 
WebDAV server (usually called a Web folder in the Windows world). When 
prompted for your access username and password, use your MobileMe 
account name and password. If you’re using Windows XP or Vista, Apple has 
provided an even easier way to manage your iDisk: Use MobileMe Control 
Panel for Windows, which you can download from www.me.com.

W
hen I was designing the Table of Contents for this book, I seriously 
considered leaving this chapter out. After all, more people use a 
Web browser now than any other software application. Who really needs a 
guide to mowing a lawn?
But then again, I suddenly thought of all the hidden features that folks 
don’t know about Apple’s Safari browser — for example, the tips and tricks 
that can help you organize your online visits. It’s a little like finding out 
more about the lawn mower itself: Even though you might not need tips 
on mowing, many people don’t know how to remove the spark plug in the 
winter or how to sharpen the blade so that you can handle taller grass. To 
paraphrase a favorite author of mine, Arthur C. Clarke, magic is nothing 
more than technology that someone understands.
In this chapter, I show you how to use those other controls and toolbar but-
tons in Safari — you know, the ones in addition to the Forward and Back 
buttons — and you’ll discover how to keep track of where you’ve been and 
where you’d like to go. (Oh, and did I mention that you’ll need an Internet 
connection?)
One note: Many authors have written entire books on Web browsing. As 
you might guess, this chapter is far narrower in scope than those books — 
I’ve got more ground to cover before dinner — and it doesn’t include every 
one of Safari’s features. However, I think the coverage that you find here will 
explain all that you’re likely to need for most surfing sessions.

Pretend You’ve Never Used This Thing
Pretend You’ve Never Used This Thing
Figure 5-1 illustrates the Safari window. You can launch Safari directly from 
the Dock, or you can click the Safari icon within your Applications folder.
Major sections of the Safari window include
 
✦ The toolbar: You’ll find the most often used commands on this tool-
bar — for tasks such as navigation, adding bookmarks, and searching 
Google. Plus, here you can type or paste the address for Web sites that 
you’d like to visit. The toolbar can be hidden to provide you with more 
real estate in your browser window for Web content. To toggle hidden 
mode, press Ô+| (the vertical bar right above the backslash) or choose 
View➪Hide/Show Toolbar.

Visiting Web Sites
 
✦ The Bookmarks bar: Consider this a toolbar that allows you to jump 
directly to your favorite Web sites with a single click or two. I show you 
later, in the section “Adding and Using Bookmarks,” how to add and 
remove sites from your Bookmarks bar. For now, remember that you 
can toggle the display of the Bookmarks bar by choosing View➪Hide/
Show Bookmarks Bar or by pressing Ô+Shift+B.
 
✦ The Content window: Congratulations! At last, you’ve waded through 
all the pregame show and you’ve reached the area where Web pages are 
actually displayed. As can any other window, the Content window can 
be scrolled; when you minimize Safari to the Dock, you get a thumbnail 
(minimized) image of the Content window.
 
 The Content window often contains underlined text and graphical icons 
that transport you to other pages when you click them. These under-
lined words and icons are links, and they make it easy to move from one 
area of a site to another or to a completely different site.
 
✦ The status bar: The status bar displays information about what the 
mouse pointer is currently resting upon, such as the address for a link 
or the name of an image; it also updates you on what’s happening while 
a page is loading. To hide or display the status bar, press Ô+/ (forward 
slash) or choose View➪Hide/Show Status Bar.
Visiting Web Sites
Here’s the stuff that virtually everyone over the age of five knows how to do 
. . . but I get paid by the word, and some folks might just not be aware of all 
the myriad ways of visiting a site. You can load a Web page from any of the 
following methods:
 
✦ Type (or paste) a Web site address into the Address box on the 
Toolbar and then press Return.
 
 If you’re typing in an address and Safari recognizes the site as one that 
you’ve visited in the past, it helps by completing the address for you. 
Press Return if you want to accept the suggested site. If this is a new 
site, just keep typing.
 
 The latest version of Safari includes a Smart Address field that displays 
a new pop-up menu of sites that match the text you’ve entered. Safari 
does this by using sites taken from your History file and your book-
marks. If the site you want to visit appears in the list, click it to jump 
there immediately.
 
✦ Click a Bookmarks entry within Safari.
 
✦ Click the Home button, which takes you to the home page that you 
specify.
 
 More on this in the section “Setting Up Your Home Page,” later in this 
chapter.

500
Navigating the Web
 
✦ Click the Show Top Sites button on the Toolbar.
 
 Safari displays a wall of preview thumbnail pages from your most fre-
quently visited sites, and you can jump to a site just by clicking on 
the preview. Click the Edit button on the Top Sites screen to delete a 
preview thumbnail — click the X — or you can “anchor” a thumbnail to 
keep it on the screen permanently by clicking the pin icon next to the 
desired thumbnail. You can also choose the size of the preview thumb-
nails in Edit mode.
 
 Because each thumbnail is updated with the most current content, the 
Top Sites wall makes a great time-saver — you can quickly make a visual 
check of all your favorite haunts from one screen!
 
✦ Click a page link in Apple Mail or another Internet-savvy application.
 
 Some Mac applications require you to hold down Ô while clicking to 
open a Web page.
 
✦ Click a page link within another Web page.
 
✦ Use the Google box in the Toolbar.
 
 Click in the Google box, type the contents that you want to find, and 
then press Return. Safari presents you with the search results page on 
Google for the text that you entered. (In case you’ve been living under 
the Internet equivalent of a rock for the last couple of years, Google.com 
is the preeminent search site on the Web — people use Google to find 
everything from used auto parts to ex-spouses.)
 
✦ Click a Safari page icon in the Dock or a Finder window.
 
 For example, Mac OS X already has an icon in the Dock that takes you 
to the Mac OS X page on the Apple Web site. Drag a site from your 
Bookmarks bar and drop it on the right side of the Dock. Clicking the 
icon that you add launches Safari and automatically loads that site.
 
 This trick works only on the side of the Dock to the right of the vertical line.
If you minimize Safari to the Dock, you’ll see a thumbnail of the page with the 
Safari logo superimposed on it. Click this thumbnail in the Dock to restore 
the page to its full glory.
Navigating the Web
A typical Web surfing session is a linear experience — you bop from one 
page to the next, absorbing the information that you want and discarding 
the rest. However, after you visit a few sites, you might find that you need 
to return to where you’ve been or head to the familiar ground of your home 
page. Safari offers these navigational controls on the Toolbar:
 
✦ Back: Click the Back button (the left-facing arrow) on the toolbar to 
return to the last page you visited. Additional clicks take you to previous 

Book 5
Chapter 5
Going Places 
with Safari
501
Navigating the Web
pages, in reverse order. The Back button is disabled if you haven’t vis-
ited at least two sites.
 
✦ Forward: If you’ve clicked the Back button at least once, clicking the 
Forward button (the right-facing arrow) takes you to the next page (or 
through the pages) where you originally were, in forward order. The 
Forward button is disabled if you haven’t used the Back button.
 
✦ Home: Click this button (look for the little house) to return to your 
home page.
 
 Not all these buttons and controls must appear on your Toolbar. To display 
or hide Toolbar controls, choose View➪Customize Toolbar. The sheet 
that appears works just like the Customize Toolbar sheet within a Finder 
window: Drag the control you want from the sheet to your Safari Toolbar or 
drag a control that you don’t want from the Toolbar to the sheet.
 
✦ AutoFill: If you fill out a lot of forms online — when you’re shopping at 
Web sites, for example — you can click the AutoFill button (which looks 
like a little text box and a pen) to complete these forms for you. You can 
set what information is used for AutoFill by choosing Safari➪Preferences 
and clicking the AutoFill toolbar button.
 
 To be honest, I’m not a big fan of releasing any of my personal informa-
tion to any Web site, so I don’t use AutoFill often. If you do decide to use 
this feature, make sure that the connection is secure (look for the padlock 
icon in the upper-right corner of the Safari window) and read the site’s 
Privacy Agreement page first to see how your identity data will be treated.
 
✦ Zoom: Shrinks or expands the size of text on the page, offering smaller, 
space-saving characters (for the shrinking crowd) or larger, easier-to-
read text (for the expanding crowd). Hence the button, which is labeled 
with a small and large letter A.
 
✦ Stop/Reload: Click Reload (which has a circular arrow) to refresh 
(reload) the contents of the current page. Although most pages remain 
static, some pages change their content at regular intervals or after you 
fill out a form or click a button. By clicking Reload (look for the curvy 
arrow), you can see what’s changed on these pages. (I use Reload every 
hour or so with CNN.com, for example.) While a page is loading, the 
Reload button turns into the Stop button — with a little X mark — and 
you can click it to stop the loading of the content from the current 
page. This is a real boon when a download takes foorrevverr, which can 
happen when you’re trying to visit a very popular or very slow Web site 
(especially if you’re using a dial-up modem connection to the Internet). 
Using Stop is also handy if a page has a number of very large graphics 
that are likely to take a long time to load.
 
✦ Open in Dashboard: Click this button to create a Dashboard widget 
using the contents of the currently displayed Web page. Safari prompts 
you to choose which clickable section of the page to be included within 

502
Navigating the Web
the widget’s borders (such as the local radar map on your favorite 
weather Web site). Click Add, and Dashboard loads automatically with 
your new widget. (More on widgets in Book II, Chapter 2.)
 
✦ Add Bookmark: Click this Toolbar button (which carries a plus sign) to add 
a page to your Bookmarks bar or Bookmarks menu. (More on this in a tad.)
 
✦ Google Search: As I mention earlier, you can click in this box and type 
text that you want to find on the Web via the Google search engine; press 
Return to display the results. To repeat a recent search, click the down 
arrow in the Google Search box and select it from the pop-up menu.
 
✦ Print: Click this convenient button to print the contents of the Safari 
window. (Dig that crazy printer icon!)
 
✦ Report Bug: A rather strange creature, the Report Bug button makes it 
easy to alert Apple when you encounter a page that doesn’t display prop-
erly in Safari. (Software developers call such glitches bugs — hence the 
name.) When you click the Bug button, you’ll see a sheet with the settings 
shown in Figure 5-2; take time to enter a short description of the problem 
that you’re having. (I also click More Options to enable the Send Screen 
Shot of Current Page and the Send Source of Current Page check boxes, 
giving the Apple folks more to work with while they’re debugging Safari.) 
Then click the Submit button to send the bug report to Apple.

at thee,

Setting Up Your Home Page
Setting Up Your Home Page
Choosing a home page is one of the easiest methods of speeding up your Web 
surfing, especially if you’re using a dial-up modem connection. However, a 
large percentage of the Mac owners whom I’ve talked with have never set their 
own home page; instead, they simply use the default home page provided by 
their browser! With Safari running, take a moment to follow these steps to 
declare your own freedom to choose your own home page:
 
1. If you want to use a specific Web page as your new home page, dis-
play it in Safari.
 
 I recommend selecting a page with few graphics or a fast-loading popu-
lar site.
 
2. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
 
3. Click the General button.
 
 You see the settings shown in Figure 5-3.
 
4. Click the Set to Current Page button.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Adding 
your own 
home page 
is an easy 
change you 
can make.
 

504
Adding and Using Bookmarks
 
5. Alternatively, click the New Windows Open With pop-up menu and 
choose Empty Page if you want Safari to open a new window with a 
blank page.
 
 This is the fastest choice of all for a home page.
 
6. Click the Close button to exit the Preferences dialog.
 
Visit your home page at any time by pressing the Home button on the Toolbar.
Adding and Using Bookmarks
No doubt about it: Bookmarks make the Web a friendly place. As you col-
lect bookmarks in Safari, you’re able to immediately jump from one site to 
another with a single click of the Bookmarks menu or the buttons on the 
Bookmarks bar.
To add a bookmark, first navigate to the desired page and then do any of the 
following:
 
✦ Choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark.
 
✦ Press the Ô+D keyboard shortcut.
 
 Safari displays a sheet where you can enter the name for the book-
mark and also select where it appears (on the Bookmarks bar or the 
Bookmarks menu).
Lean, fast, and mean — That’s RSS
Well, maybe not mean — after all, I don’t want you 
to be afraid of RSS (RDF Site Summary) pages! 
RSS Web sites display updated information 
using a shortened list format, rather like a news-
paper headline, without unnecessary graphics 
or silly advertisements. You can tell when a Web 
site has RSS pages available because Safari dis-
plays an RSS icon at the right side of the Address 
box on the Toolbar. (When you click the RSS 
icon, the Web address switches to a feed:// 
prefix — another indication that you’re not in 
Kansas reading HTML pages anymore.)
To display more information about a news item 
on an RSS page, click the item headline. Safari 
opens the corresponding Web page — yep, 
once again you’re back in the world of HTML — 
and you can read the full story. To return to the 
RSS feed, click the Back button on the Toolbar. 
Naturally, RSS feed pages can be bookmarked. 
In fact, Apple gives you a number of RSS sites 
that you can explore immediately.
To customize your RSS display, choose 
Safari➪Preferences and then click the RSS 
tab. By default, Safari checks for updated 
RSS headlines every 30 minutes, but you can 
change this to an hourly or daily check. (Of 
course, you can also check for updates manu-
ally by reloading the RSS page, just as you 
would any other Web page.) New articles 
can be assigned a highlighted color, and you 
can specify the amount of time an item should 
remain on the RSS page after it’s published.

Adding and Using Bookmarks
 
✦ Drag the icon next to the Web address from the Address field to the 
Bookmarks bar.
 
You can also drag a link on the current page to the Bookmarks bar, but note 
that doing this adds a bookmark only for the page corresponding to the link — 
not the current page.
To jump to a bookmark
 
✦ Choose it from the Bookmarks menu.
 
 If the bookmark is contained in a folder, which I discuss later in this 
section, move your mouse pointer over the folder name to show its con-
tents and then click the bookmark.
 
✦ Click the bookmark on the Bookmarks bar.
 
 If you’ve added a large number of items to the Bookmarks bar, click the 
More icon on the edge of the Bookmarks bar to display the rest of the 
buttons.
 
✦ Click the Show All Bookmarks button (which looks like a small, opened 
book) on the Bookmarks bar and then click the desired bookmark.
 
 The Bookmarks window that you see in Figure 5-4 appears — complete 
with swank Cover Flow display — where you can review each collection 
of bookmarks at leisure. As you might expect, Safari’s Cover Flow works 
just as the Cover Flow view does in a Finder window.
 
Figure 5-4:
The 
Bookmarks 
window 
puts all your 
bookmarks 
within easy

506
Downloading Files
 
 The more bookmarks you add, the more unwieldy the Bookmarks menu 
and the Bookmarks window become. To keep things organized, choose 
Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark Folder and then type a name for the new 
folder. With folders, you can organize your bookmarks into collections, 
which appear in the column at the left of the Bookmarks window (or as 
separate submenus within the Bookmarks menu). You can drag book-
marks into the new folder to help reduce the clutter.
To delete a bookmark or a folder from the Bookmarks window, click it and 
then press Delete.
Downloading Files
A huge chunk of the fun that you’ll find on the Web is the ability to download 
images and files. If you’ve visited a site that offers files for downloading, typi-
cally you just click the Download button or the download file link, and Safari 
takes care of the rest. You’ll see the Downloads status window, which keeps 
you updated as to the progress of the transfer. While the file is downloading, 
feel free to continue browsing or even download additional files; the status 
window helps you keep track of what’s going on and when everything will be 
finished transferring. To display the Download status window from the key-
board, press Ô+Option+L.
By default, Safari saves any downloaded files to the Downloads folder that 
appears in your Dock, which I like and use. To specify the location where 
downloaded files are stored — for example, if you’d like to scan them auto-
matically with an antivirus program — follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
 
2. Click the General tab and then click the Save Downloaded Files To 
pop-up menu.
 
3. Choose Other.
 
4. Navigate to the location where you want the files stored.
 
5. Click the Select button.
 
6. Click the Close button to exit Preferences.
To download a specific image that appears on a Web page, move your 
mouse pointer over the image and hold down Control while you right-click 
(or Control-click). Then choose Save Image As from the pop-up menu that 
appears. Safari prompts you for the location where you want to store the file.
You can choose to automatically open files that Safari considers safe — things 
like movies, text files, and PDF files that are very unlikely to store a virus 
or a damaging macro. By default, the Open “Safe” Files after Downloading 
check box is selected on the General pane. However, if you’re interested

Tabs Are Your Browsing Friends
in preventing anything you download from running until you’ve manually 
checked it with your antivirus application, you can deselect the check box 
and breathe easy.
 
Luckily, Safari has matured to the point that it can seamlessly handle virtu-
ally any multimedia file type that it encounters. However, if you’ve down-
loaded a multimedia file and Safari doesn’t seem to be able to play or display 
it, try loading the file within QuickTime Player. As you can read in Book III, 
Chapter 8, QuickTime Player is the Swiss Army knife of multimedia players, 
and it can recognize a huge number of audio, video, and image formats.
Using Subscriptions and History
To keep track of where you’ve been, you can display the History list by click-
ing the History menu. To return to a page in the list, just choose it from the 
History menu. Note that Safari also arranges older history items by the date 
you visited the site, so you can easily jump back a couple of days to that 
page you forgot to bookmark!
In fact, Safari also searches the History list automatically, when it fills in an 
address that you’re typing — that’s the feature I mention in the earlier sec-
tion “Visiting Web Sites.”
To view your Top Sites thumbnail screen, press Ô+Shift+1 or choose Show 
Top Sites from the History menu.
If you’re worried about security and would rather not keep track of where 
you’ve been online, I show you how to clear the contents of the History file 
in the “Handling ancient history” section, later in this chapter.
Tabs Are Your Browsing Friends
Safari also offers tabbed browsing, which many folks use to display (and orga-
nize) multiple Web pages at one time. For example, if you’re doing a bit of 
comparison shopping for a new piece of hardware between different online 
stores, tabs are ideal.
When you hold down the Ô key and click a link or bookmark using tabs, a tab 
representing the new page appears at the top of the Safari window. Just click the 
tab to switch to that page. (If you don’t hold down Ô, things revert to business 
as usual, and Safari replaces the contents of the window with the new page.) 
Figure 5-5 illustrates a number of pages that I’ve opened in Safari using tabs.
You can also open a new tab by clicking the plus sign that appears at the 
upper-right corner of the Safari window.

508
Saving Web Pages
 
Figure 5-5: 
Hang on, 
Martha; 
we’ve 
struck tabs!
 
To fine-tune your tabbed browsing experience, choose Safari➪Preferences 
to display the Preferences dialog; then click Tabs. From here, you can turn 
off the confirmation window that normally appears when you close Safari 
with multiple tabs or windows open. You can also specify whether a new tab 
or window automatically becomes the active window within Safari.
 
Done with a page? You can remove a tabbed page by clicking the X button 
next to the tab’s title.
Saving Web Pages
If you’ve encountered a page that you’d like to load later, you can save it to disk 
in its entirety. (Just the text, mind you, not the images.) Follow these steps:
 
1. Display the desired page.
 
2. Choose File➪Save As or press Ô+S.
 
3. In the Save As text field, type a name for the saved page.

Protecting Your Privacy
 
4. From the Where pop-up menu, navigate to the location where you 
want to store the file on your system.
 
 To expand the sheet to allow navigation to any location on your system, 
click the button with the downward arrow.
 
5. Click the Format pop-up menu to choose the format for the saved page.
 
 Usually, you’ll want to choose a Web Archive, which saves the entire 
page and can be displayed just as you see it. However, if you want to 
save just the HTML source code, choose Page Source.
 
6. Click Save to begin the download process.
 
 After the Save file has been created, double-click it to load it in Safari.
 
A quick word about printing a page within Safari: Some combinations of 
background and text colors might conspire together to render your printed 
copy practically worthless. In a case like that, use your printer’s grayscale 
setting (if it has one) or deselect the Print Backgrounds check box in the 
Print dialog. Alternatively, you can simply click and drag to select the text on 
the page, press Ô+C to copy it, and then paste the text into Word or Pages, 
where you can print the page on a less offensive background (while still 
keeping the text formatting largely untouched). You can also save the con-
tents of a page as plain text, as I just demonstrated.
 
If you’d rather mail the contents of a Web page to a friend — or just a link

Protecting Your Privacy
No chapter on Safari would be complete without a discussion of security, 
against both outside intrusion from the Internet and prying eyes around 
your Mac. Hence this last section, which covers protecting your privacy.
 
Although diminutive, the padlock icon that appears at the top of the Safari 
window when you’re connected to a secure Web site means a great deal! A 
secure site encrypts the information that you send and receive, making it 
much harder for those of unscrupulous ideals to obtain things such as credit 
card numbers and personal information. You can click the padlock icon 
(next to the site name) to display the security certificate in use on that par-
ticular site.

Protecting Your Privacy
Yes, there are such things as bad cookies
First, a definition of this ridiculous term: A cookie, a small file that a Web site 
automatically saves on your hard drive, contains information that the site 
will use on your future visits. For example, a site might save a cookie to pre-
serve your site preferences for the next time or — in the case of a site such 
as Amazon.com — to identify you automatically and help customize the 
offerings that you see.
In and of themselves, cookies aren’t bad things. Unlike a virus, a cookie file 
isn’t going to replicate itself or wreak havoc on your system, and only the 
original site can read the cookie that it creates. However, many folks don’t 
appreciate acting as a gracious host for a slew of little snippets of personal 
information. (Not to mention that some cookies have highly suggestive 
names, which could lead to all sorts of conclusions. End of story.)
You can choose to accept all cookies — the default — or you can opt to dis-
able cookies altogether. You can also set Safari to accept cookies only from 
the sites you choose to visit. To change your Cookie Acceptance Plan (or 
CAP, for those who absolutely crave acronyms), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences.
 
2. Click the Security toolbar button.
 
 Safari displays the preference settings shown in Figure 5-6.

3. Choose how to accept cookies via these radio button choices:
 
 Never: Block cookies entirely.
 
 Always: Accept all cookies.
 
 Only from Sites You Navigate To: Personally, I use this option, which 
allows sites like Amazon.com to work correctly without allowing a 
barrage of illicit cookies.
 
4. To view the cookies currently on your system, click the Show Cookies 
button.
 
 If a site’s cookies are blocked, you might have to take care of things 
manually, such as by providing a password on the site that used to be 
read automatically from the cookie.
 
5. Click the Close button to save your changes.
Cleaning your cache
Safari speeds up the loading of Web sites by storing often-used images and 
multimedia files in a temporary storage, or cache, folder. Naturally, the files 
in your cache folder can be displayed (hint), which could lead to assump-
tions (hint, hint) about the sites you’ve been visiting (hint, hint, hint). 
(Tactful, ain’t I?)
Luckily, Safari makes it easy to dump the contents of your cache file. Just 
choose Safari➪Empty Cache; then click Empty to confirm that you want to 
clean up your cache.
Handling ancient history
As you might imagine, your History file leaves a very clear set of footprints 
indicating where you’ve been on the Web. To delete the contents of the 
History menu, choose History➪Clear History (at the very bottom of the 
History menu).
Safari also allows you to specify an amount of time to retain entries in your 
History file. Open the Safari Preferences dialog, click the General tab, and then 
click the Remove History Items pop-up menu to specify the desired amount of 
time. Items can be rolled off daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or yearly.
Avoiding those @*!^%$ pop-up ads
I hate pop-up ads, and I’m sure you do, too. To block most of those pop-up 
windows with advertisements for everything from low-rate mortgages to 
“sure-thing” Internet casinos, click the Safari menu and verify that Block 
Pop-Up Windows is selected. (If it’s not selected, click the menu item to 
toggle the menu item on.)

512
Protecting Your Privacy
 
From time to time, you might run across a Web site that actually does some-
thing constructive with pop-up windows, such as present a download or login 
prompt. If you need to temporarily deactivate pop-up blocking, press 
Ô+Shift+K to toggle it off. Then press Ô+Shift+K again to turn pop-up block-
ing back on after you’ve finished with the site. 

Chapter 6: Staying Secure Online
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding the dangers of going online
✓ Using a firewall
✓ Avoiding trouble online
I
 know that you’ve heard horror stories about hacking: Big corporations 
and big government installations seem to be as open to hackers as a 
public library. Often, you read that even entire identities are being stolen 
online. When you consider that your Mac can contain very sensitive and 
private information in your life — such as your Social Security number and 
financial information — it’s enough to make you nervous about turning on 
your computer long enough to check your eBay auctions.
But how much of that is Hollywood? How truly real is the danger, especially 
to Mac owners? And how can you protect yourself? The good news is that 
you can easily secure your data from all but the most determined hacker — 
in fact, depending on the hardware that you’re using to connect to the 
Internet, you might be well guarded right now without even knowing it.
In this chapter, I continue a quest that I’ve pursued for over a decade now — 
to make my readers feel comfortable and secure in the online world by 
explaining the truth about what can happen and telling you how you can 
protect your system from intrusions.
 
One quick note: This chapter is written with the home and small-business 
Mac owner in mind. Macs that access the Internet through a larger cor-
porate network are very likely already protected by that knight in shining 
armor, the network system administrator. (Insert applause here.) Of course, 
if you’re using Mac OS X in your office, you’re still welcome to read and 
follow this material — especially if you have a laptop that could act as a car-
rier for viruses from home; however, check with your system administrator 
before you attempt to implement any of the recommendations that I make.
What Can Really Happen?
Before I begin, I want to offer you a moment of reassurance and a little of 
my personal background to explain that I’m well qualified to be your guide 
through this online minefield. (After all, you don’t want Jerry Lewis lecturing 
you on how to maintain your Internet security. He’s a funny guy, though, 
convenez-vous?)

514
What Can Really Happen?
 
✦ I’ve been running and managing all sorts of online systems since the 
days of the BBS (Bulletin Board System), the text-based dinosaurs that 
used to rule the online world in the early ’80s to early ’90s. (In fact, my 
first book was on this very subject — and it contained a chapter on 
viruses long before they were the darlings of the techno-media.)
 
✦ As a consultant, I run Web sites and squash virus attacks for a number 
of companies and organizations.
 
✦ I run a popular Internet radio station that serves up ’70s hits in CD-quality 
to anyone with a high-speed DSL or cable Internet connection and a copy 
of iTunes. (More on this broadcasting revolution in Book III, Chapter 2.)
 
✦ I keep my own office network of six computers safe from attack while 
still providing readers all over the world with Web sites and the 
aforementioned radio station and BBS.
With that understood, here’s what can happen to you online without the 
right safeguards, on any computer:
 
✦ Hackers can access shared information on your network. If you’re 
running an unguarded network, others can gain access to your 
documents and applications or wreak havoc on your system.
 
✦ Your system could be infected with a virus or dangerous macro. Left to 
their own devices, these misbehaving programs and macro commands 
can delete files or turn your entire hard drive into an empty paperweight. 
(Although Mac viruses are very rare as I write this, I don’t think we’ll 
enjoy such luxury for long. Plus, if you dual-boot your Intel Mac into 
Windows XP or Windows Vista, you’ve suddenly entered a veritable 
minefield of PC viruses and spyware. More on this in a page or two.)
 
✦ Unsavory individuals could attempt to contact members of your 
family. This kind of attack may take place through iChat, e-mail, or Web 
discussion boards, putting your family’s safety at risk.
 
✦ Hackers can use your system to attack others. Your computer can be 
tricked into helping hackers when they attempt to knock out Web serv-
ers and public-access File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites on the Internet. 
Along the same lines, that innocent Web server you put online can be 
misused by spam-spewing, online “entrepreneurs.” (Cute name, right?)
 
✦ Criminals can attempt to con you out of your credit card or personal 
information. The Internet is a prime tool used by those trying to steal 
identities.
To be absolutely honest, some danger is indeed present every time you or 
any user of your Macintosh connects to the Internet. However, here’s the 
good news. With the right safeguards, it’s literally impossible for most of 
those worst-case scenarios to happen on your Macintosh, and what remains 
would be so difficult that even the most die-hard hacker would throw in the 
towel long before reaching your computer or network.

What Can Really Happen?
Using a Macintosh gives you an advantage: Hackers and virus developers 
(there’s a career for you) are traditionally interested only in “having fun” 
with PCs running Windows, so the likelihood that Snow Leopard could pick 
up a virus is far less than it would be if you were using Windows XP or Vista. 
As I mentioned earlier, if you boot into Windows using Snow Leopard’s 
dual-boot feature on your Intel-based Macintosh, you need to pay heed to 
Windows XP or Vista security.
 
Because this is a book that focuses on Mac OS X Snow Leopard, I won’t be 
spending much time covering Windows. If you’d like a comprehensive guide 
to Windows XP, Windows Vista, and the PC world, however, I can heartily 
recommend the sister volume to this book, PCs All-in-One Desk Reference For 
Dummies, Fourth Edition, published by Wiley. Why the strong recommenda-
tion? Well, I wrote that book as well!
Evidently, Apple just doesn’t have the numbers to attract the attention of the 
Bad Guys yet . . . yet another reason to enjoy the exclusive nature of the Mac 
universe (and its UNIX foundation)! (Heck, I even know a couple of fellow 
Mac owners who feel they just don’t need antivirus protection — but believe 
me, this is not an area where you want to be lax and lazy, and you still need 
an antivirus application! More on antivirus software later in this chapter.)
I also want to point out that virtually everyone reading this book — as well as 
the guy writing it — really doesn’t have anything that’s worth a malicious hack-
ing campaign. Things like Quicken data files, saved games of Sims 2, and genea-
logical data might be priceless to us, of course, but most dedicated hackers are 
after bigger game. Unfortunately, the coverage that the media and Hollywood 
give to corporate and government attacks can turn even Aunt Harriet more than 
a little paranoid. Therefore, time for another of Mark’s Maxims:
 
It’s not really necessary to consider the FBI or Interpol each time you poke 
your Mac’s power button. A few simple precautions are all that’s required.
If it smells phishy . . .
Ever heard of the word phishing? Con artists 
and hackers create Web sites that look just 
like major online stores — including big names 
such as eBay, PayPal, and Amazon. These 
turkeys then send out junk e-mail messages 
that tell you that you must log on to this 
Web site to refresh or correct your personal 
information. As you’ve no doubt already 
guessed, that information is siphoned off and 
sold to the highest bidder. Your credit card, 
your password, and your address. Luckily, 
if you follow the tips that I give later in this 
chapter in the section “A Dose of Common 
Sense: Things Not to Do Online,” you’ll avoid 
these phishing expeditions!

“Shields Up, Chekov!”
“Shields Up, Chekov!”
“Okay, Mark, now I know the real story on what can happen to my computer 
online. So what do I do to safeguard my Macintosh?” You need but two 
essential tools to protect your hardware (besides a healthy amount of 
common sense, which I cover in the upcoming section “A Dose of Common 
Sense: Things Not to Do Online”): a firewall and an antivirus program.
Firewall basics
First, a definition: a firewall is a piece of hardware or software that essentially 
builds an impermeable barrier between the computers on your side of the 
wall (meaning your Mac and any other computers on your network) and all 
external computers on the other side of the wall (meaning the rest of the 
Internet).
“But wait a second — if other computers can’t reach me and my Mac can’t 
reach them, how can I use the Internet at all?” Ah, that’s the beauty of 
today’s firewalls. By using a series of techniques designed to thwart attacks 
from the outside, a firewall allows you to communicate safely, even 
monitoring what you send and what you receive for later examination. 
Figure 6-1 illustrates the basics of a firewall.
The term hacker dates far back in the annals of 
the personal computer — in fact, it originally 
had nothing to do with networks, the Internet, 
or illegal activities at all . . . because In The 
Beginning, there was no public Internet!
“Explain yourself, Chambers!” All right. The 
original hackers were electronics buffs, ham 
radio operators, computer hobbyists, and 
engineers who built (or hacked) a working 
computer out of individual components with 
a soldering gun and a whole lotta guts. At the 
time, you didn’t simply order a computer from 
Dell or visit your local Maze o’ Wires store in 
the mall to select your favorite system.
No, I’m talking about the mid-’70s, in the 
halcyon time before IBM even introduced the 
IBM PC (and when the only folks using the 
Internet, which wasn’t called that back then, 
were military folks and researchers). Even the 
simplest computer — really nothing more than 
a glorified calculator by today’s standards — 
had to be lovingly assembled by hand. These 
early personal computers didn’t run software 
as we know it. Instead, you programmed them 
manually through a bank of switches on the 
front, and they responded with codes displayed 
on a bank of lights. (Think about that the next 
time you launch Microsoft Word 2008.)
Today, of course, the need to assemble a 
computer from individual transistors is non-
existent, and the word hacker has an entirely 
different connotation — but don’t be surprised 
if you meet an older member of your Macintosh 
user’s group who’s proud to be an old-fashioned 
hacker! (Look for the soldering gun, usually 
worn in a holster like a sidearm.)

(can be

or both)
A firewall sounds grand and incredibly complex and highly technical — and 
sometimes it is — but it can also be incredibly simple. For example:
 
✦ You can spend anywhere from $50 to thousands of dollars installing 
sophisticated firewall hardware and/or software.
 
 or
 
✦ You can activate your firewall by disconnecting your dialup, digital 
subscriber line (DSL), or cable modem from the wall socket.
Believe it or not, both of those examples technically involve a firewall. In 
the first case, the firewall is a physical, tangible presence on the network; in 
the second case, the lack of a connection to the Internet actually acts as a 
firewall. (Think of it as the Air Firewall.) I’ve spoken to a number of readers 
who actually do this; however, if you’re running a Web site or downloading 
a file from your company’s FTP site, yanking the connection when you head 
to bed isn’t an option. Therefore, most of us will install a physical firewall 
through hardware or software.
Do I already have a firewall?
In some cases, you might already be using a hardware firewall and not even 
know it. For example, many Internet-sharing devices include a built-in NAT 
firewall. NAT stands for Network Address Translation, and it’s the most 
effective and popular hardware firewall standard in use by consumer 
devices. If you’re using an Internet sharing hub or router, check its manual 
to determine whether it offers NAT as a firewall feature — and if so, turn 
it on if NAT isn’t enabled by default. (See Book VI, Chapter 2 for more on 
Internet sharing, routers, and firewalls.)

518
“Shields Up, Chekov!”
For instance, Figure 6-2 illustrates the configuration screen for my Internet 
router. Note the options to disable port scanning and ping responses, which 
are two tricks that hackers often use to detect what’s often called a hot 
computer — meaning that the computer can be identified and is accessible 
to attack. (Wireless networks are notoriously hot — for more information on 
securing your wireless connections, visit Book VI, Chapter 4.)
Using the internal Mac OS X firewall
Mac OS X includes a powerful internal firewall, which Snow Leopard makes 
very simple to use! Most Mac owners will be perfectly satisfied with this 
built-in firewall, which is configured through System Preferences — find 
more information on setting up your firewall in Book VI, Chapter 2.
Using a commercial software firewall
You’ll also find a number of popular alternatives to Snow Leopard’s built-in 
firewall on the market that offer more control over individual applications 
and more configuration options than your Mac OS X firewall. For example, 
consider these commercial software firewall applications:

✦ Symantec, Norton Internet Security for Mac, $80 (www.symantec.
com): Symantec provides both antivirus and firewall protection for the 
PC and the Macintosh. Frequent updates and top-of-the-line technical 
support ensure that your firewall stays current and that you can get 
help when you need it.
 
✦ Intego, NetBarrier X5, $50 (www.intego.com): NetBarrier X5 comes 
with a number of preset configurations that allow you to choose a basic 
firewall for your network environment with a single click.
 
Whether you set up the internal firewall, a shareware firewall, or a commercial 
firewall, visit a favorite site of mine on the Web: www.grc.com, the home 
of Gibson Research Corporation. There you’ll find the free online utility 
ShieldsUP!!, which will automatically test just how tight your firewall is and 
how susceptible your Mac could be to hacker attacks. Visit this site often 
because this service is updated periodically to reflect new hacking techniques.
Antivirus basics
Next, consider your antivirus protection (both under Snow Leopard and 
Windows XP/Vista, if you’re running Boot Camp on an Intel-based Mac). 
Viruses are typically transmitted through applications — you run a program, 
and the virus is activated. (Although not the traditional definition of a virus, 
both scripts and macros can be used to take control of your system and 
cause trouble, as well.) Therefore, you need to closely monitor what I call 
The Big Three:
 
✦ Web downloads: Consider every file that you receive from the Internet 
as a possible viral threat.
 
✦ Removable media: Viruses can be stored on everything from CD-ROMs 
and DVD-ROMs to USB flash drives.
 
✦ E-mail file attachments: A “Trojan Horse” or “worm” application sent to 
you as an e-mail attachment is an easy doorway to your system.
Horrors! Mac OS X has no built-in antivirus support. (Then again, neither 
does Windows.) However, a good antivirus program will take care of any 
application that’s carrying a virus. Some even handle destructive macros 
within documents. Make sure that the antivirus program you choose offers 
real-time scanning, which operates when you download or open a file. 
Periodic scanning of your entire system is important, too, but only a real-
time scanning application such as Norton AntiVirus can immediately ensure 
that the StuffIt and Zip archives or the application you just received in your 
e-mail Inbox is actually free from viruses. (Oh, and don’t forget that many of 
the Software Updates released by Apple for Snow Leopard will plug security 
holes in our favorite operating system.)
 
Virus technology continues to evolve over time, just as more beneficial 
application development does. For example, recently a virus was discovered 

520
A Dose of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online
that’s actually contained in a JPEG image file! With a good antivirus application 
that offers regular updates, you’ll continue to keep your system safe from 
viral attack.
I heartily recommend both Norton AntiVirus from Symantec (available 
in versions for Snow Leopard and Windows) and Intego’s VirusBarrier 
X5 (available for Snow Leopard only). Both programs include automatic 
updates delivered while you’re online to make sure that you’re covered 
against the latest viruses.
A Dose of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online
One more powerful weapon that you can use to make sure that your Mac 
stays safe from unlawful intrusion is this: Practicing common sense on the 
Internet is just as important as adding a firewall and an antivirus application 
to your Mac.
With this in mind, here’s a checklist of things that you should never do while 
you’re online:
 
✦ Never download a file from a site you don’t trust. And make sure that 
your antivirus software is configured to check downloaded files before 
you open them.
 
✦ Never open an e-mail attachment until it has been checked. Don’t give 
in to temptation, even if the person who sent the message is someone 
you trust. (Many of today’s macro viruses actually replicate themselves 
by sending copies to the addresses found through the victim’s e-mail 
program. Of course, this problem crops up regularly in the Windows 
world, but it’s been known to happen in the Macintosh community as 
well.)
 
✦ Never enter any personal information in an e-mail message unless 
you know the recipient. Sure, I send my mailing address to friends and 
family, but no one else. In fact, even e-mail can be intercepted by a deter-
mined hacker, so if you’re sending something truly important, use an 
encryption application, such as PGP Personal Desktop (www.pgp.com).
 
✦ Never enter any personal information on a Web site provided as a 
link in an e-mail message. Don’t fall prey to phishing expeditions. Some 
of these e-mail-message/Web-site combinations look authentic enough 
to fool anyone! No reputable online company or store will demand or 
solicit your personal information through e-mail or through a linked 
Web site. In fact, feel free to contact the company through its real Web 
site and report the phishing attempt!
 
✦ Never include any personal information in an Internet newsgroup 
post. (In case you’re not familiar with the term, newsgroups are public 
Internet message bases, often called Usenet groups. Most ISPs offer a 

Book V
Chapter 6
Staying Secure 
Online
521
A Dose of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online
selection of newsgroups that you can access.) Newsgroup posts can be 
viewed by anyone, so there’s no such thing as privacy in a newsgroup. 
(For a glimpse of just how long one of these posts can linger in the great 
Internet continuum, visit www.google.com, click the Groups button, 
and search for your name. I can pull up newsgroup messages that I 
posted back in 1995!)
 
✦ Never buy from an online store that doesn’t offer a secure, encrypted 
connection when you’re prompted for your personal information and 
credit card number. If you’re using Apple’s Safari browser, the padlock 
icon appears next to the site name in the title bar. When the padlock 
icon appears in the title bar, the connection is encrypted and secure.
 
✦ Never divulge personal information to others over an iChat connection.
 
✦ Never use the same password for all your electronic business. Use 
different passwords that include both letters and numbers, change them 
often, and never divulge them to anyone else.
 
✦ Never give anyone else administrative access to your Web server.
 
✦ Never allow any type of remote access (such as sharing screens) to 
your Macintosh or your network without testing that access first. It’s 
very important to restrict remote access to visitors whom you trust.
Find more details on securing your network from intrusion — including 
Internet hacker attacks — in Book VI. I cover System Preferences that can 
affect the security of your system in Book II.

Chapter 1: Setting Up 
a Small Network
In This Chapter
✓ Finding out what a network is and why you might want one
✓ Setting up the network hardware
✓ Configuring network system preferences
✓ Troubleshooting your network
I
n the not-so-distant past — I’m talking 10–15 years ago — networks were 
found only in huge companies that had the money and the workforce to 
pay for and maintain them. But now, as technology rolls on, a home or small 
office network is both very affordable and relatively easy to create. In this 
chapter, I introduce you to this helpful beastie: You discover what networks 
are, what you can do with them, and how to set up a small network of your 
own for your home or small business.
Networks can be used for many things. Computers exchange all types of 
data over a network: files that you want to send between computers or 
to networked printers, streaming audio or video broadcasts, data for 
multiplayer computer games, or even a private company Web site (typically 
called an intranet). Anything that you can imagine that would involve 
moving data between multiple computers can be done by using a network.
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
First, let me define network. In a nutshell, a network is a combination of 
hardware, cables, and software that allows computers and printers to talk 
to one another. (Heck, you don’t even need cables with a wireless network, 
as I show you in Chapter 3 of this minibook.) To have a network, you need 
the right hardware and software. Some of the hardware and most of the 
software that you’ll need probably came with your Mac, depending on 
which Mac you have. As you progress through this chapter, you’ll discover 
everything that’s required to set up your network so that you can pick up 
any additional parts you need. Any good-sized computer store (either the 
brick-and-mortar or online variety) has everything that you need to get up 
and running.

526
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
Ethernet standards allow for operation at 
different speeds. Because the Ethernet 
standard has improved over time, some older 
Ethernet devices support only the older (slower) 
speeds. Ethernet’s speed is rated by how much 
data it can transfer in a second — usually 
in millions of bits per second, or megabits 
per second (Mbps). Originally, Ethernet was 
designed to run at 10 Mbps. Now there are 
different speeds of Ethernet: 10 Mbps, 100 
Mbps, 1000 Mbps, and even faster.
1000 Mbps Ethernet — also called Gigabit 
Ethernet or just Gigabit for short — is still a bit 
on the expensive side for small home or office 
networks. All consumer-level Gigabit Ethernet 
NICs also support running at 10 Mbps or 100 
Mbps, so you will hear them called 10/100/1000 
Ethernet NICs. All current Mac models come 
with a 10/100/1000 Ethernet NIC built in, including 
the MacBook and Mac mini. Although Gigabit 
NICs are now priced under $100, most of the 
devices that can connect Gigabit NICs still cost 
significantly more than their 10/100 counter-
parts. That fact, coupled with the reality that 
most computer systems can’t really even 
handle or dish out that much data, makes 
Gigabit Ethernet a choice only for those 
wanting a high-end network with the best 
performance.
NICs and other Ethernet equipment that handle 
only 10 Mbps are rapidly becoming obsolete 
because virtually all the modern NICs and other 
Ethernet hardware support both 10 Mbps and 
100 Mbps. Most times, you’ll see this labeled as 
10/100 Ethernet. For your home networking, you 
probably want to invest in 10/100 Mbps.
Remember: Keep your eye out for Ethernet NICs 
and equipment that handle only 100 Mbps. You 
won’t see it much, but be wary because it can’t 
interconnect with 10 Mbps Ethernet NICs and 
equipment. I advise against buying it — stay 
compatible, and you’ll be a happy puppy.
Thirty-nine flavors of Ethernet . . . but no Rocky Road
Now, back to the requirements: You need the right hardware and software 
to make your network sing. This section covers each component with a 
description about the role that each part plays on the network and other 
good stuff you’ll want to know to get your network right the first time.
Something to network
Okay, this might be obvious, but I’m nothing if not thorough. The first thing 
that you need to build a network is . . . well, stuff! That’s right, you need to 
have devices that you want to network. Most times these are computers 
(whether Macs or PCs running Windows/Linux/UNIX), printers, personal 
digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, and other stand-alone, network-
capable devices (such as file servers and shared tape back-up drives).

What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
Network interface card (NIC)
A network interface card, or NIC, is a hardware device that your computer 
uses to talk to the rest of the network. The NIC connects to the network 
cabling, and it speaks the language of electronics, sending data around the 
network. Nowadays, most networks use the Ethernet networking protocol, 
and most NICs are Ethernet compatible. All Intel-based Mac models have 
Ethernet NIC hardware built right onto the Mac’s main system board.
Switch
So you have an assortment of devices in your home or small office that 
you’ve decided to network. How do you make them all interconnect? 
Although you could connect just two computers by using nothing more than 
a single crossover cable, you need fancier hardware to connect more than 
two computers: namely, a switch. The switch is used to connect everything, 
so it’s the focal point of the network. Without a switch, you don’t have a 
network.
A switch is really just a small box that has a bunch of Ethernet ports on it. 
A port is really just like an Ethernet NIC on your computer, but a switch has 
lots of them. Inside, all those Ethernet ports are arranged so that the talking 
(sending) wires from each port connect to the listening (receiving) wires on 
all other ports. Therefore, when one computer talks, all others listen.
Setting up a switch (and therefore giving birth to your network, which 
sounds more painful than it is) is usually no more difficult than connecting a 
power cable to the device and then plugging in your computers with their 
own Ethernet cables. You’ll see various lights on the box — usually a power 
light indicating that the switch is powered on and operational. You’ll also 
see lights that correspond to each port on the switch; these lights tell you 
what’s going on in the box. For instance, you normally see the following 
types of lights:
 
✦ Link light: Each port on a switch should have a link light. Link lights 
simply tell you which ports have something alive connected to a given 
port — tthat is, a device is connected and powered on.
 
✦ Speed light: Each port on the switch should have a speed light, which 
tells you the speed of the device at the other end. Some switches have 
different lights for different speeds, and some use a single light and 
make it different colors for different speeds.
 
✦ Activity light: When one computer speaks, they all hear it. Typically, an 
entire switch has only one activity light for the entire network, indicating 
that someone is speaking. With heavy traffic, the light can appear solid.

528
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
 
Bear with me whilst I spew techno-talk for a paragraph or two. When an 
Ethernet switch receives a frame — that’s the name for a standard unit, or 
packet, of network data — it reads the label on the frame to see the return 
address of the computer that sent the frame. In a short amount of time (after 
being turned on and watching the data move around), a switch figures out 
which computer is located on which port. Then, whenever data comes into 
the switch, it looks at the header (some information on the front of all 
frames, much like a mailing label on a package that you send) and sees 
which computer should receive the frame. The switch then sends the frame 
out the port for that computer only.
This is A Good Thing. Instead of forcing all computers on the network to 
listen while one Mac speaks (as antique network hubs did) — known as half-
duplex — a switch sends the data directly to the only computer that needs 
to hear it.
Cables
Cables are the ties that bind . . . literally. Cables are used to connect the 
Ethernet port on each computer to the switch, the central hardware of the 
network. With a little experience, you’ll be a cable-wielding superhero with 
hundreds of feet of cable draped across every piece of furniture in your 
place for your first LAN party. (A LAN party, by the way, is when way too 
many techies bring their computers into a very small space, connect them, 
and play games for 48 hours straight. Oh, and we eat a lot, too. Good stuff!)
Here’s the scoop on what kind of cables to use. Technically, you can run 100 
Mbps Ethernet over Cat5 cable (like a super-version of the wire that you use 
for your telephones).
 
Although you can do 10/100 Mbps Ethernet over Cat5 cable, any new cables 
that you buy should be Cat5E or Cat6 — which I talk about in the following 
section — because these types of cables are specifically meant for use with 
1000 Mbps (or Gigabit) Ethernet. I’m sure you noticed that the common 
denominator here is the Cat5 cable. That’s because fiber optic cable, 
although supporting speeds of 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and even 10 Gbps, is much 
more expensive and more difficult to install.
Hey, did I mention that you can eschew cables entirely? For more informa-
tion on the lean, mean world of wireless networking, see Chapter 3 of this 
minibook.
 
Be sure to buy straight-through Cat5E/Cat6 cables (also called patch cables) 
and not crossover cables, which are used only in certain circumstances. 
Crossover cables are mainly used to connect two computers directly (to 
form a tiny, two-computer network), connect a cable/DSL modem directly to 
a computer, or connect multiple switches.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Setting Up a Small 
Network
529
Setting Up Your Network
 
Cat5 cable supports speeds of 100 Mbps. 1000 Mbps Ethernet, of course, is 
designed to run ten times faster than that; luckily enough, it was engineered 
to be compatible with 90 percent of Cat5 installations. Having said that, I 
must also point out that some Cat5 cables don’t stick to the stringent specifi-
cations that 1000 Mbps Ethernet requires. The newer version of Cat5 cable is 
Category 5 Enhanced, or Cat5E for short. Cat5E is recommended for any new 
installation because it can easily handle 10/100 Mbps Ethernet and yet can 
handle 1000 Mbps Ethernet as well. Even if you’re using 10/100 Mbps 
Ethernet, you can upgrade someday to 1000 Mbps without having to worry 
about upgrading your cabling. You may also find Cat6 cabling in your net-
work travels, which can also easily handle 10/100/1000 Mbps speeds.
Setting Up Your Network
After you collect the hardware components I list earlier in this chapter, 
you’re ready to connect things. Here’s a quick list of things to do to get your 
network fired up:
 
1. Find the best location for placing your switch.
 
 To keep costs down, try to place the switch in a location close to a 
power outlet that’s centrally located so that you can use the least 
amount of cable. If cost isn’t an issue, hide the unit in a closet and just 
run all the cables along the walls to the hub or switch. And if cost really 
isn’t an issue, get your house fully wired with Cat5E cable.
 
2. Plug the switch into the power socket.
 
 Some switches come on automatically when you plug them in and can 
never be turned off. Others have a power switch that you need to turn 
on the first time that you plug them in.
 
3. Verify that the switch is working by looking at the lights on the front. 
Check the manual that came with the switch to see what light configu-
ration is normal for that particular unit.
 
 Until you have computers or printers attached to it, you might just have 
a status light that shows the switch is powered on. But if the lights on 
your unit don’t match up with what the manual says, you could have a 
bum unit that you need to return.
 
4. Verify that all your devices are near enough to the switch to be con-
nected by your cables; then turn them all on.
 
5. Get one of your Cat5E or Cat6 cables and connect one cable from the 
Ethernet jack on your computer, usually on the side or back, to an 
open port on the switch.
 
 You should see a link light or speed light come on that verifies that the 
two devices sense each other. (You might also have a link light on your 
NIC where you plug in the cable, but that depends on the Mac you’re 
using.)

530
Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
 
6. Repeat Step 5 until each device is attached to the switch.
Congratulations, you’re a network technician! (Don’t forget to call your 
friends and brag.) The first phase of the network, the physical connection, is 
complete; the next step is the configuration of Mac OS X.
Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
Take a deep breath; there’s no need to panic — in fact, configuring your 
network software basically involves entering a lot of numbers and other stuff 
in dialogs. (In fact, most folks can just allow Snow Leopard to take care of 
network settings automatically.) But just so that you’ll understand what’s 
involved, this section explains what those numbers are, what they do, and 
why you ought to know it. Because this is a Mac OS X book, I stick with 
configuring Macs running the Big X.
TCP/IP
First things first: Protocol is just the techno-nerd word for a set of rules or 
a language. A protocol is a language that computers use to communicate. 
Without protocols, the computers on your network would never be able 
to speak to one another even though you have NICs, cables, and a hub or 
a switch. The Internet Protocol (IP) part of the TCP/IP suite is what you’re 
really interested in because it’s the most important part of your network 
configuration chore.
IP addresses
IP addresses are like street addresses for computers on a network. Each 
computer on the network has an IP address, and it needs to be unique 
because no other computer can share it. When a computer wants to 
communicate with another computer, it can simply send the data on the 
network in a nice package that has its address as well as the address of 
the computer that it’s trying to talk to. (Remember frames? If not, take a 
refresher in the earlier section “Switch.”)
An IP address is just a number, but it’s written in a strange way. (Go figure.) 
All IP addresses are written as four sets of numerals between 0 and 255 with 
a dot (period) between each set. For instance, a common IP address that 
you might run into is 192.168.0.1. As everyone knows, engineers can’t sleep 
unless they have three or four ways to write the same thing, including IP 
addresses. The form shown above — which is by far the most common — is 
dotted notation. Each number, such as 192, is an octet.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Setting Up a Small 
Network
531
Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
 
Don’t worry too much about this stuff: You don’t have to remember terms 
like octet to create your own network. They could be helpful, however, if 
something goes wrong and you need to place a call to tech support. Plus, 
you can impress the computer salesperson (gleefully called a wonk by 
Mac power users) at your local Maze ’o Wires store with your mastery of 
techno-babble.
IP addresses at home versus on the Internet
One very important thing to keep in mind is that the Almighty IP Address 
Police — Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (www.iana.org) — has 
broken IP addresses into groups. The two main types of IP addresses are 
public and private:
 
✦ Public IP addresses can be used on the Internet and are unique 
throughout the whole world.
 
✦ Private IP addresses are used in homes or businesses and can’t be used 
to talk to the public Internet. Private IP addresses are used over and 
over by many people and most commonly take the form 192.168.x.x.
You’ll almost always get a public IP address from your Internet service 
provider (ISP), whether you’re using a cable modem, digital subscriber line 
(DSL), or a regular dial-up modem. If you use a cable/DSL router or Snow 
Leopard’s built-in sharing software to share your Internet connection among 
multiple computers, you’ll be using private IP addresses on your network 
while using a single public IP address to talk to the Internet. (More on that in 
Chapter 4 of this minibook.)
“Great! I get an IP address, put it into my Network settings in System 
Preferences, and off I go. Right?” Well, you’re close, but here are a few other 
pieces of information that you might need before you can go surfing around 
the world:
 
✦ Default gateway: When you send information to other networks — 
whether in another building or around the world on the Internet — your 
computer needs to know the IP address of the gateway that will forward 
your data down the line. The default gateway is really just the IP address 
of a router, which is a device that connects multiple networks. A gateway 
gets its name because it really is your gateway to all other networks.
 
✦ Subnet mask: A subnet mask is a number that helps your computer 
know when it needs to send stuff through the router. It’s a group of four 
octets with dots, just like an IP address, but almost always uses 0 or 255 
for each of the four octets. Most often, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. 
If the wrong number is entered for the subnet mask, it could keep you 
from talking to the Internet or even to computers on your own network.

532
Configuring Network System Preferences
Software applications
After you have the hardware in place and you’ve chosen and configured a 
protocol to allow the computers to all talk to one another, you need software 
to make use of your new network connections. Time for more good news: A 
lot of the software that you need to move data on your network is included 
already in Mac OS X! Here are brief descriptions of some of the network soft-
ware and protocols already built into Mac OS X and what they’re used for:
 
✦ FTP: File Transfer Protocol (FTP), part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, 
allows computers of any type — Mac, PC, Linux, UNIX, mainframe, or 
whatever — to transfer files back and forth.
 
✦ Telnet: Telnet is also part of the TCP/IP suite — you can use it to 
remotely connect to a computer and execute commands on the remote 
machine.
 
✦ Samba: Samba (or SMB) is an open source software suite that enables 
Mac OS X users to share files with people using Windows computers and 
allows the Mac users to connect to files that the Windows computers 
share.
 
✦ HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), also part of the TCP/IP suite, 
is used by Web browsers to provide access to all the various pages on 
the World Wide Web.
Configuring Network System Preferences
In this section, I show you how to configure your Mac to communicate with 
other computers on a local network.
Leave it to Snow Leopard to provide you with assistance — in this case, 
when you first open the Network pane, you might be greeted with a dialog 
offering you assistance on setting up the stuff I cover in this section. 
(Whether you get this absolutely free offer of aid depends on whether you 
upgraded your Mac from a previous version of Mac OS X or whether you 
entered your network and Internet settings within the Snow Leopard Setup 
Assistant.) If you do decide to allow the Snow Leopard Internet/Network 
assistant to guide you through your network setup, I’ll meet back up with 
you at the next section.
Using DHCP for automatic IP address assignment
Now I’d like to introduce you to a very dear friend of mine — an abbreviation 
that you will soon grow to love, as does everyone else who’s set up a small 
Mac network. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP for short, is a 
protocol that enables a computer to automatically get all the information 
that I’ve talked about to this point. (Check in your Webster’s . . . this is the 
very definition of the word godsend.)

Book VI
Chapter 1
Setting Up a Small 
Network
533
Configuring Network System Preferences
You’re saying, “Mark, there’s gotta be a catch, right?” Well, here’s the bad 
news: Before you can use DHCP, you have to add a DHCP server, which 
provides other computers on the network with their configuration settings. 
Here’s the good news: Most Internet connection-sharing hardware devices 
(and software-sharing implementations as well) provide a DHCP server as 
part of the price of admission. (Internet connection sharing allows all your 
networked computers to access the Internet through a single Internet 
connection. I cover it more in Chapter 4 of this minibook.) Most wired 
and wireless routers can provide DHCP services these days. Technology 
marches on.
If you plan to use Internet connection sharing or you know that you have 
a DHCP server on your network, you can set up your Mac to automatically 
obtain the required IP address and information. Open System Preferences 
from the Dock or the Apple menu and choose Network. From the Network 
dialog that appears, click the Ethernet entry in the list on the left. Choose 
Using DHCP from the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu; then click the Apply Now 
button. Mac OS X contacts the DHCP server to obtain an IP address, a subnet 
mask, a gateway router IP address, and a Domain Name System (DNS) 
address. (DNS servers convert a human-friendly address, like www.yahoo.
com, to a computer-friendly IP address, like 66.218.71.86.)
A few seconds after clicking the Apply Now button, you should see the 
information come up, as provided by the DHCP server. This lets you know 
that the process worked and configuration is complete. You might also 
notice that the DNS Servers information is empty. Fear not: Mac OS X is 
really using DNS information provided by the DHCP server. Press Ô+Q to 
quit System Preferences and save your settings.
 
If you ever make a network change that screws things up, such as entering the 
wrong subnet mask or an IP address that isn’t in the same range as others on 
your LAN, you can always click the Revert button to get back your old settings.
 
One DHCP server on a network is princely, but two or more DHCP servers on 
a single network will fight like alley cats and grind everything to a halt. 
Therefore, if you’re considering adding a DHCP server to an existing network, 
make doggone sure that you’re not treading on another server’s toes. (Ask 
that network administrator person.)
Manually choosing an IP address range
You say you don’t have a DHCP server, and you need to manually assign 
IP addresses? This configuration means two things: You need to manually 
configure the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/
IP) Properties. Keep in mind that for now, you’re not concerned with the 
Internet — just computers on the local network.

534
Configuring Network System Preferences
A result of being on a local network — because it’s not connected to 
the Internet, it’s also called a private network — is that you must use IP 
addresses that are reserved for private network use. You can use a few 
different ranges of IP addresses, but I recommend that you choose an 
address range from the 192.168.x.x networks. In the next section, I show 
you how.
Down to business: I recommend that you use IP addresses in the 192.168.x.x 
range. What does this mean exactly? Well, here’s the scoop:
 
✦ Use IP addresses where the first two octets are 192 and 168 (192.168).
 
 Octet numbers are conjoined by periods.
 
✦ For the third octet, select any number between 1 and 254.
 
 It doesn’t matter which one you choose as long as you use this same 
third number on all computers on your network.
 
✦ For the fourth octet, select any number between 1 and 254.
 
 Make sure that every computer on your local network has a different 
fourth octet number. This is very important — your network doesn’t 
work otherwise.
 
✦ Use 255.255.255.0 as your subnet mask.
For instance, suppose that you’re using three computers on your network. 
All the IP addresses that you use will start with 192.168. Next, suppose you 
choose 123 for the third octet. (Remember that you can choose any number 
between 1 and 254.) Finally, for the fourth octet, choose the numbers 100, 
105, and 110 for the three computers, respectively. (Again, you can choose 
any numbers between 1 and 254.) The resulting IP addresses used on the 
three computers are
192.168.123.100
192.168.123.105
192.168.123.110
 
By the way, I should mention that there are other range possibilities for 
reserved private networks — AirPort and AirPort Extreme hardware uses a 
10.x.x.x network range, for example — but the 192.168.x.x range is definitely the 
most popular and the most common default on Ethernet network hardware.
After you know the IP addresses and the subnet mask that you’re going to 
use, start setting up each computer. Being a nice guy, I walk you through 
the process of configuring Mac OS X with the 192.168.123.105 address as an 
example.

ple) in the IP Address text box.
 
6. Enter the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 in the Subnet Mask text box.
 
7. If you’re using a router or hardware Internet sharing device, enter the 
IP address used by the router in the Router text box.

Repeat this same procedure with the other IP addresses for each of the

536
Verifying Connectivity
 
Most ISPs also supply DNS server addresses and search domains. If your ISP 
included DNS server addresses or search domains, don’t forget to type them 
into the corresponding boxes on the TCP/IP panel.
Verifying Connectivity
After you have your Macs connected and your TCP/IP configuration is done, 
check to make sure that everything is working. After you have at least two 
computers on your network, each with a TCP/IP address, you can use a 
simple little utility called ping to test the connection.
ping is a very simple, yet extremely helpful, utility that’s the first connectivity-
testing tool out of the box, even for network professionals. When you use 
the ping utility — referred to as pinging something — the application sends 
out a small packet of data to whatever destination you’re trying to reach. 
When the receiving computer hears the ping, it answers with a ping reply. If 
the original computer receives the ping reply, you know that the connection 
between the computers is good.
To ping a computer, you use a little application built in to Mac OS X called 
Network Utility, which allows you to work various network wonders (including 
checking connectivity, watching the route that your computer takes to get 
to another computer, and looking up information about Internet domain 
names). To use Network Utility to check network connectivity, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Open a Finder window, click Applications, and click Utilities.
 
2. Double-click the Network Utility icon to launch the application.
 
3. Click the Ping tab (see Figure 1-2).
 
4. In the Enter the Network Address to Ping text field, enter the IP 
address of the computer that you want to ping.
 
5. To simply verify connectivity, select the Send Only x Pings radio 
button and enter a low number, such as 5, in the text field.
 
 Five or ten pings are plenty to see whether the connection is good.
 
6. Click the Ping button.
 
 Your Mac sends ping packets to the IP address that you entered.
 
If the pings are successful, text appears in the text box at the bottom of the 
Ping tab: one line for each ping reply received from the other computer. The 
end of each line reads time= with a number at the end. That number is the 
amount of time, in 
1⁄1000 of a second (milliseconds [ms]), that it took for the 
ping packet to go from your computer to the other computer and back.

Troubleshooting Your New Network
 
Figure 1-2: 
Preparing to 
ping. (Can 
you say 
that with 
a straight 
face?)
 
If your ping is unsuccessful, you see nothing, at least for a little bit. Each 
ping that you send takes two seconds before it’s considered missing in 
action. So, if you choose five pings, wait ten seconds before you see the 
results. After all the pings time out — a ping times out when it doesn’t get 
returned in the proper amount of time — you see a line of text appear that 
reads ping: sendto: No route to host or 100% packet loss. Both 
error messages mean the same thing: All the ping packets that you sent out 
are now in the packet graveyard, never to be seen again. As you’ve likely 
guessed already, this is not a good sign for your network connectivity. Look 
to the following section, “Troubleshooting Your New Network,” to find out 
where to begin troubleshooting this problem.
 
If you can ping all the other computers on your network from one of the 
computers, you don’t need to go to each computer and ping all the others. 
You can logically assume that all the computers can communicate. For 
instance, if you can ping computers B, C, and D from computer A, you don’t 
need to bother with ping tests from computer B, C, or D.
After you have your computers configured and you’ve verified connectivity 
among them, start doing the fun stuff that a network allows you to do, such 
as sharing data, printing, and (most important) playing games with users on 
other computers.
Troubleshooting Your New Network
After a network is set up and operating, it rarely has problems — still, 
Murphy sometimes takes charge, and the darn thing just won’t work right. 

538
Troubleshooting Your New Network
When you do have problems with the network, I recommend using a standard, 
consistent approach to finding and fixing the problem. This section breaks 
down troubleshooting into two areas:
 
✦ The hardware: The best place to start troubleshooting a network 
problem is with the actual equipment, such as the NICs, cables, and 
hubs/switches. (See earlier sections on each equipment type.)
 
✦ The software: The second place to check for problems is in the con-
figuration of the computers on the network, specifically the configuration 
on the computer(s) having the problem that you’re troubleshooting.
Physical problems with your network
Although many things on a network can go bad or cause problems, usually 
network problems are caused by faulty equipment or wiring. Sometimes 
it’s something as simple as a cable not being plugged in snugly. Looking at 
the physical cables, connections, and equipment is always the best place 
to start looking for problems. Here is a quick list of physical things to check 
while trying to fix network problems:
 
1. Make sure that both ends of the network cable are firmly connected.
 
 First check the end that plugs into the computer and then check the end 
that connects to the switch.
 
2. Turn on the problematic computer to be sure that it’s connected to a 
hub or switch.
 
 Check the port on the switch to see whether the link/speed light is lit. 
(Depending on the switch that you have, you might not have a link light. 
Many switches use a speed light to indicate a link. Check the manufac-
turer’s manual for your model.) If your computer is on and connected 
but no link/speed light is lit, try replacing the network cable.
 
3. If you replace the network cable and there still isn’t light, try 
unplugging the cable from the switch and plug it into another port.
 
 Choose one of the other computers connected to the switch that works, 
unplug it, and plug the broken computer into that port for testing. 
Occasionally, a single port on a switch goes bad; if that happens, just 
mark it as bad and don’t use it anymore. But if all computers connected 
to the switch stop working, it’s probably the switch that’s gone south. 
If the switch is still under warranty, I recommend getting it fixed or 
replaced.
 
4. If you replace the cable, try a different port on the switch, and if other 
computers work fine on that switch, the NIC inside your computer has 
possibly gone bad.
 
 If you reach this determination, call your local service center to have it 
looked at and repaired. If you have an older model on which the NIC was 
added instead of built in, you can simply replace the NIC yourself.

Troubleshooting Your New Network
 
The key when troubleshooting physical problems is the link/speed light on 
the switch. If the link/speed light still doesn’t work, the problem likely isn’t 
physical. Start troubleshooting the network configuration on the computer 
itself.
Network configuration problems
After checking the hardware, look for problems in the network settings. 
When using TCP/IP on your network, look for these specific things: the TCP/
IP configuration mode, IP address, subnet mask, and router IP address (if 
you’re using a router to connect to the Internet or other networks). To check 
these settings, open System Preferences and click the Network icon to bring 
up the Network pane. Click the Ethernet entry in the list and then follow 
these steps:
 
1. Make sure that the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu is set to the appropriate 
option.
 
• Using DHCP: Select the Using DHCP option only if you’re using a 
cable/DSL modem/router or other DHCP server. Otherwise, set this 
to Manually.
 
• Manually: If the configuration is set to Manually, check the IP 
Address, DNS Servers, Router, and Subnet Mask fields to make sure 
that they’re correct. If you’re not sure whether your Subnet Mask 
field entry is correct, you can usually make it the same as other 
computers on the same network with you. Most times, the subnet 
mask is 255.255.255.0.
 
2. To check your Internet connectivity to the rest of the Internet, try 
pinging www.apple.com.
 
 This checks the router and DNS settings.
 
3. If you’re set up for DHCP and your TCP/IP settings remain blank, 
make sure that your DHCP server — which could be your cable/DSL 
modem/router — is turned on and working properly.

✓ Sharing your files and printers with other Macs
✓ Sharing your files with Windows computers
✓ Accessing files on Windows computers
✓ Configuring the built-in firewall
✓ Remote-controlling your Mac from afar
H
ere’s one of those incredibly complex concepts that you always find 
in these computer books: After you have your network all set up and 
ready to go, you can do all kinds of things with it. (Now wasn’t that utterly 
painless?) You can use your network to share files, share printers, remotely 
control your Mac, or even play multiuser games against other friends. To 
keep your files safe from unwanted snoops, you can configure the Mac OS 
X built-in firewall. In this chapter, I cover the basics of file sharing, sharing 
printers, and using the firewall to protect yourself from intruders.
It’s All about (File) Sharing
One of the main reasons for building a network is sharing files between 
computers. You might even want to set up a server, which is a computer 
with shared files that are always available to anyone on the network. Think 
of a server as a common file storage area for the rest of the network. Really, 
any computer that shares files is technically a server because it’s serving, 
so to speak. But most people use the word server only to mean a computer 
that’s dedicated solely to serving files, printers, and so on for the rest of the 
network.
Creating an account
Sharing files on your Mac with other Mac users is a piece of cake. 
Remember, however, that you need to create an account for anyone whom 
you want to have access to your files. The accounts that you create can 
access only three folders, as shown in Figure 2-1:

542
It’s All about (File) Sharing
 
Figure 2-1: 
The location 
of user 
folders and 
the Shared 
folder on 
your hard 
drive.
 
 
✦ The account’s Home folder: That specific account’s Home folder carries 
a short version of the username that’s in the Users folder on your hard 
drive. Figure 2-1 shows the Home folder, which is noted with an icon 
that looks like a house, for the mark account (where mark is the short 
account name for Mark Chambers). The Home folder icon always bears 
the short account name for the user who’s currently logged in.
 
✦ The account’s Public folder: Each user account you create also has a 
Public folder located within its Home folder. Any files you place in the 
Public folder can be accessed by any user on your Mac.
 
✦ The Shared folder: This folder is also in the Users folder on your hard 
drive. Anyone with an account on your Mac can access the Shared 
folder, so it’s a great place to keep common files that everyone wants to 
copy or use.
To create an account, you need to be logged in as an Admin user. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open System Preferences from the Apple menu (Ô) or the Dock.
 
2. Click the Accounts icon.
 
3. Click the New Account button, which carries a plus sign.
 
4. Fill in the appropriate information, including the name for the 
account and a password.
 
 Note that the name that appears as the short name determines the name 
of that user’s Home folder.
 
5. Click Create Account.
 
6. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences.

I cover creating accounts in greater detail in Book II, Chapter 5, but that’s 
the short version.
Enabling file sharing
When you enable file sharing, your files are exchanged over Transmission 
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
Follow these steps to turn on sharing:
 
1. Open System Preferences.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
 
3. Select the File Sharing check box to enable it.
Connecting to a shared resource
At the top of the Sharing pane, you can see that other Macintosh users can 
access your computer at afp://<ip address>, where ip address is the 
IP address for your specific computer. When another Mac user wants to 
connect to your shared files, that person can do the following:
 
1. Choose Go➪Connect to Server from the Finder menu bar.
 
2. After the Connect to Server dialog opens, other Mac users can 
type afp://<ip address> (where ip address is the IP address of your 
Macintosh) and then click the Connect button.
 
You can also browse for a shared resource on the Connect to Server dialog. 
Choose Go➪Connect to Server or press Ô+K. Click Browse to locate the 
shared computer. Note that you might be prompted to choose whether you 
want to connect as a Guest or a Registered User. To connect to the server as 
a Registered User, you must supply the right username and password. If you 
connect as Guest, you don’t have to supply a password, but you will have 
restricted access to only the Public folder for each account on the system 
that you connect to. If you need to connect as a Registered User, ask an 
Admin user who controls that Mac to supply you with the correct username 
and password.
Give the username and password that you created to the person using the 
other Mac, and he or she can now access files in that account’s Home folder 
as well as any other Public folders on your computer.
The sidebar that appears in Finder windows offers a Shared heading. Click 
the arrow next to Shared to display other shared resources on your network, 
just as if you had clicked Browse from the Connect to Server dialog. (I’m 
starting to think Snow Leopard might be a synonym for convenience.)

544
Sharing a Connected Printer
Sharing a Connected Printer
Sharing your printer for others to use is one of the best reasons to have a 
network. Setting up your Mac to share your printer is very easy under Mac 
OS X. Here’s a quick rundown of what you need to do:
 
1. Open System Preferences.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Network section to open 
the Sharing Preferences pane.
 
3. Click the Printer Sharing check box to enable it.
 
 By default, when you turn on Printer Sharing, Snow Leopard automatically 
shares all the current printers connected to your Mac. To select which 
printers can be used for shared printing, click the Print & Fax icon in 
System Preferences. From this pane, you can enable and disable sharing 
on individual printers.
After Printer Sharing is enabled, follow these steps to connect to that printer 
from other computers on your network:
 
1. Click System Preferences in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Print & Fax icon.
 
3. Click the Add button (which carries a plus sign).
 
 You might be prompted to add a printer automatically when the Printer 
Setup Utility opens. Click the Add button to begin the addition. (For 
more on adding a printer with the Printer Setup Utility, see Book VII, 
Chapter 4.)
 
4. From the Browser window that opens, click the Default button on the 
toolbar.
 
5. Click the shared printer you want to use and then click the Add 
button.
 
Already have the Printer Browser open? Then follow the easier path: Clicking 
the Default toolbar button displays all the available local shared printers. 
Click the desired printer and then click Add.
Sharing Files with Windows Computers
If you’ve deigned to allow PCs running Windows on your network (a gen-
erous gesture to the lower classes), you’ll probably want to also share 
files with those computers. Sharing files with a Windows PC — actually a 
Windows user — is very similar to sharing files with other Mac users.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Using Your Network
545
Accessing File Shares on Windows Computers
 
File sharing must be enabled, as I demonstrated earlier in this chapter. 
(When you share with other Macs, you’re also making those files available 
to PCs.)
To allow file sharing with Windows computers, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
 
3. Click the File Sharing entry.
 
4. Click the Options button.
 
5. Click the user account (or accounts) that will be accessible by 
Windows PCs.
 
 Snow Leopard will growl while you try to enable SMB sharing. That’s 
because you have to enable Windows access on the desired account 
before it can be used. Snow Leopard prompts you for your password, 
smugly informing you that the account password will be stored “in a less 
secure manner.” (Take that, Mr. Gates!) Generally, this isn’t a problem, 
but never enable an account for Windows access unless trusted individuals 
will use it.
 
6. Click the Share files and folders using SMB check box to enable it.
 
7. Click Done to exit the Advanced dialog, and close the System 
Preferences window to save the changes.
Accessing File Shares on Windows Computers
If you allow a Windows PC to access your files, you’ll also probably want to 
putter around with files on a Windows PC. Easy!
Because File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a part 
of the TCP/IP suite, it works on virtually every 
type of computer (over both the Internet and 
your local area network). So, assuming that you 
have your computer connected to the Internet 
through a modem or a local area network (LAN) 
connection, everything that I discuss about 
FTP and how to use it applies to connecting to 
FTP servers on the Internet as well. When you 
connect to FTP servers on the Internet, you can 
use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (or FQDN 
for short), such as ftp.apple.com instead 
of an actual IP address. You can also use the 
FTP server in Mac OS X to make files available 
to friends on the Internet just as you would to 
make them available on a LAN.
Using FTP on the Internet

546
Using FTP to Access Files
Accessing files on Windows computers relies on the Samba component (a 
part of the UNIX foundation of Mac OS X). Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Go➪Connect to Server from the Finder.
 
 The Connect to Server dialog opens.
 
2. In the Address box, enter smb://<ip address>, where ip address is the 
IP address of the Windows computer that you want to connect to.
 
3. Click the Connect button.
 
 Depending on the type of account you have on the Windows PC, Mac OS X 
might display an SMB (Server Message Block) authentication dialog in 
which you can enter your username and password. (Think security for the 
Windows crowd.)
 
4. Select the desired shared drive to mount from the pop-up menu.
 
5. Mount the shared drive according to the Windows version:
 
✦ If you’re accessing a file shared on a Windows 95 or Windows 98 computer: 
Simply click OK to mount the share.
 
✦ If you’re accessing a file shared on a Windows NT, 2000, XP, or Vista 
computer: Click the Authenticate button. Then enter your username and 
password, click OK, and then click OK again to mount the share.
After you mount the shared drive, you’ll see it appear on your Desktop, just 
as you see a Mac volume. You can use this drive just as you do any other 
drive on your system. To disconnect from the Windows share, you can
 
✦ Drag the icon to the Trash in the Dock (which changes to an Eject icon 
when you start dragging).
 
✦ Press Ô+E.
 
 or
 
✦ Hold Control, click the icon, and then choose Eject from the menu that 
appears. (If your pointing thing has multiple buttons, right-click the icon 
instead.)
Using FTP to Access Files
FTP is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite ( the hoary acronym FTP stands 
for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is one of the oldest methods for sharing files 
between computers; however, because it’s part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, 
it can be used on many different kinds of computers, including those running 
just about any type of strange and arcane operating system. You can still 
manage to exchange files regardless of whether you’re using Mac OS X, 
Windows, Linux, or UNIX. (Heck, even dinosaurs like DOS can join the party.)

Book VI
Chapter 2
Using Your Network
547
Using FTP to Access Files
FTP is a client/server application. In plain English, this means that two pieces 
make things tick: the server (which hosts the connection, rather like a file 
server) and the client (which connects to the server). Mac OS X, thanks to its 
UNIX foundation, has both an FTP server and client built in. To use FTP, you 
need a computer running the FTP server software to give others access to 
files; then the other computer, or client, can connect to the FTP server. 
After the connection is made, the client can either send files to the server 
(uploading) or get files from the server (downloading). In this section, I cover 
how to use FTP to give others access to your files as well as talk about the 
FTP applications that come with Mac OS X.
Using the Mac OS X built-in FTP to share files
One way to give others access to your files is to run an FTP server on your 
Mac. Mac OS X comes with an FTP server built in, so you just have to 
activate it. You might wonder why you’d use FTP to share files when you 
can use Personal File Sharing or Windows File Sharing. The main advantage 
to FTP is compatibility: Not only can people on your LAN access files, but 
anyone on the Internet can also access your files, regardless of the type of 
machine they’re using.
Just as you do with the other file-sharing methods, you need to create a user 
account on your computer before someone can connect to and get files from 
your Mac. After you have accounts created for the users, you can enable FTP 
sharing like this:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
 
3. Click the File Sharing entry.
 
4. Click the Options button.
 
5. Click the Share Files and Folders Using FTP check box to enable it.
 
 Always helpful, Snow Leopard reminds you on the Advanced sheet that 
people can use ftp://<ip address>, where ip address is the IP address 
of your Mac.
 
6. Click Done to exit the Advanced dialog, and close the System 
Preferences window to save the changes.
 
If you’re using an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station or other cable/digital 
subscriber line (DSL) router to share your Internet connection, place the Mac 
that you want people on the Internet to access in a DMZ, or demilitarized 
zone. Check your cable/DSL router documentation for more information.

548
Using FTP to Access Files
Using FTP from Terminal to transfer files
You can use FTP to transfer files with an FTP server by using the command-
line interface (CLI); to use the CLI, open a Terminal, or shell, session. To 
use a Terminal session, double-click the Terminal icon in the Utilities folder 
inside the Applications folder. When you open a Terminal session, you’re 
presented with a window that accepts text commands. You’ll see a prompt 
that consists of your computer’s name and the folder that you’re currently 
in, followed by your user ID. It’s at this prompt where you type various FTP 
commands.
After you’re in the Terminal session, you’ll use a series of commands to 
connect to another computer, move in and out of folders, and transfer files. 
Following is a list of the basic commands that you need to use FTP as well as 
a brief description of what each command does.
 
✦ ftp: This command starts the FTP command-line interface session. You 
can tell that you’re in the FTP client application when you see ftp> as 
your command prompt. This is where you type all other FTP commands 
to do things.
 
✦ open: This command is used to start your connection to another 
computer. Type this command followed by the IP address of the FTP 
server that you want to connect to.
 
✦ ls: Use this command to see a listing of all files and folders in the 
current folder on the FTP server.
 
✦ cd: This command allows you to change the folder that you’re in. Type 
cd <folder> (where folder is a specific folder name) to move into a 
subfolder on the FTP server. Type cd .. (that’s c, d, space, and two 
periods) to go back out a folder level.
 
✦ lcd: This command acts exactly like cd except that it changes the folder 
that you’re currently in on your local system, not the FTP server. Use 
this command to put yourself in the folder on the local drive that you 
want to transfer files to and from.
 
✦ bin: Type this command to get in binary mode to transfer files that 
aren’t plain-text files. (Always use binary mode unless you’re specifically 
transferring plain-text files.)
 
✦ ascii: This command puts you in ASCII mode for transferring text files.
 
✦ get or mget: To retrieve a single file, use the get command followed by 
the filename of the file that you want to retrieve. If you want to get 
multiple files at one time, use the mget command followed by a filename, 
possibly containing * and/or ? as wildcards.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Using Your Network
549
Using FTP to Access Files
 
✦ put or mput: To send a single file, use the put command followed by 
the filename to send a file to the FTP server. To send multiple files, use 
the mput command followed by a filename, possibly containing * and/or 
? as wildcards.
 
✦ quit: Use the quit command to end your FTP session.
To end a Terminal session and exit Terminal at any time, press Ô+Q. 
Terminal prompts you for confirmation if necessary.
 
Many FTP servers will let you send files only to certain folders. Most times 
this folder is named Upload, Uploads, or something similar.
Using these commands will enable you to exchange files with an FTP server. 
Here’s an example of how to use these commands within the Terminal 
window:
 
1. Type ftp to get into FTP mode.
 
2. Type open <ip address> (where ip address is the server’s network IP 
address) to open your connection to the FTP server.
 
3. At this point, you’re asked for a username and password.
 
 For many FTP servers, using the username anonymous and your e-mail 
address as the password is enough to get you logged in. Some sites even 
allow you to log in without any username or password at all. On secure 
sites, however, you must use an assigned username and password 
provided by the administrator of that particular server.
 
4. Type lcd <folder> (where folder is a specific folder name) to change 
into the folder on your local drive that you want files to come to or 
from.
 
5. Type the ls and cd commands to place yourself into the desired folder 
on the FTP server.
 
6. Type the ascii or bin command to set your file transfer mode to ASCII 
or binary, respectively.
 
 This is important because choosing the wrong type will likely cause the 
transfer to fail. Unless it’s a plain-text file, always use binary mode.
 
7. Type the get, mget, put, and mput commands to send or receive the 
desired files.
 
8. Type the quit command to close the connection and exit the FTP 
session.

550
Using the Built-in Firewall
Using the Built-in Firewall
A firewall watches all the network communications coming into your Mac. It 
automatically plays the role of security guard, blocking or denying certain 
network traffic that you want to prevent from reaching your Mac. It acts 
as another layer of security to help keep you safe from unwanted attacks. 
That’s all well and good, but you must be careful to set up your firewall 
correctly before you turn it on: A configuration mistake could make your 
Mac inaccessible from the network.
For instance, if you want to enable FTP access on your Mac but you also 
want to keep all other traffic from coming into your Mac, you can tell the 
built-in firewall to allow only FTP traffic. The firewall on the Mac will block 
or allow only TCP/IP traffic — not Bonjour — so Bonjour traffic (which is 
always from your local network and not the Internet, anyway) can always 
get in.
When enabled, the firewall blocks all traffic that comes into your Mac. By 
default, however, the firewall is turned off. So, your first job is to enable the 
firewall, which you can do by following these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Security icon.
 
3. Click the Firewall tab.
 
4. Click the Start button to turn on your firewall.
 
5. Click the Advanced button to show the settings that you see in 
Figure 2-2.
 
6. Click the Automatically Allow Signed Software to Receive Incoming 
Connections radio button to select it.
This enables the firewall. And, by default, all incoming TCP/IP traffic is 
blocked. You must enable each sharing method that you want to be able to 
use. When you enable different sharing methods from the Sharing pane in 
System Preferences (such as File Sharing or FTP Access), you’ll notice that 
those types of traffic now appear in the Firewall list. (In other words, when 
you turn on a sharing method, the firewall automatically allows traffic for 
that sharing method, which Snow Leopard calls a service. Most excellent.)
 
Click the up/down arrow icon to the right of any service to specify whether 
the firewall should allow or block connections.
Sometimes, you might want to allow other traffic through your firewall that 
isn’t on the firewall list of recognized services and applications. At that 
point, you can click the Add button (which bears a plus sign) to specify the

application that your firewall should allow. Snow Leopard presents you 
with the familiar Add dialog, and you can choose the application that needs 
access.

Remote Control of Your Mac
Forgive me whilst I wax techno-nerd here: One of the coolest advantages 
to a network is the ability to take control of one computer from another 
computer. For example, sometimes you may need to access files on your 
Mac while you’re on a trip, but you don’t have File Sharing enabled. What 
can you do? You can remotely connect into your Mac and then — just as if 
you were sitting in front of it — enable File Sharing (as I demonstrate earlier 
in the chapter). Perhaps you have a file on your computer with someone’s 
phone number that you suddenly need on the road. With remote control, it’s 
at your fingertips! (Sigh . . . ah, technology.)
Using Screen Sharing
Snow Leopard’s Screen Sharing feature, which is available from iChat, can be 
turned on for individual users from the Sharing pane in System Preferences. 
You can allow access for all user accounts on your Mac or limit remote 
access to selected users. Screen Sharing is Apple’s implementation of VNC 
technology.

552
Remote Control of Your Mac
To set up Screen Sharing, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
 
3. Click the Screen Sharing check box to select it.
 
4. To limit remote access for specific accounts, click the Only these users 
radio button, and click the Add button (which bears a plus sign) to 
select a user.
 
5. Close the System Preferences window to save the change.
After you’ve enabled screen sharing, you can use the Buddies ➪Share My 
Screen menu item in iChat to share your screen with another person. To 
view another person’s screen, use the Buddies ➪Share Remote Screen menu 
item. (For the details on iChat and Screen Sharing, see Book V, Chapter 3.)
Remotely control your Mac (for free, no less!)
Virtual Network Computing (or VNC, available for many platforms at www.
realvnc.com) is a very nice application that enables you to remotely control 
a computer from pretty much anywhere that has an Internet connection. 
VNC is easy to install and configure, and it runs on many different platforms, 
ranging from Windows XP and UNIX on desktop computers and servers to 
Palm OS and Windows CE on personal digital assistants (PDAs). Wrap your 
mind around this: You could be at a friend’s house on her wireless network 
and use your PDA to remotely control your Mac at home over the Internet. 
Pure, undiluted sassy!
 
Some networks have proxies and firewalls that might interfere with VNC’s 
operation. You can remotely control a computer that’s behind a firewall or 
cable/DSL router, but the firewall/router needs to be configured properly. 
Because the process varies from one manufacturer to the next, check your 
cable/DSL router manual for instructions on how to do this.
How VNC works
In a nutshell, VNC takes the graphical interface on your monitor, turns it into 
data, and sends it to the computer that you’re using to remotely control it. 
The computer that you’re using sends keyboard presses, mouse movements, 
and clicks to it, acting just the same way as it would if you were sitting right 
in front of it.
 
As I mentioned earlier, you can use Snow Leopard’s Screen Sharing feature in 
iChat to make a remote connection from another Mac to your Mac. However, 
you’re not limited to using just another Mac using Snow Leopard and Screen 
Sharing in iChat — you can control your Mac from a Windows PC or from an 
older version of Mac OS X as well! If you’ve already enabled Screen Sharing (as 
I demonstrate earlier in this chapter), follow these steps to enable any VNC 
connection:

Mr. Paranoia speaks again: Make doggone sure that you set up the password

a hacker would have with free remote control over your Mac OS X Desktop.

554
Remote Control of Your Mac
Remote control of another computer from your Mac
A few different VNC viewers exist for Mac OS X. A VNC viewer is just an 
application you use to remotely control your computer running VNC. You 
can download them at www.realvnc.com/download.html. If you find 
yourself on a computer without a VNC viewer — heaven forbid — VNC 
server actually runs over the Web as well! As long as the computer that 
you’re using has a Web browser that supports Java — which Safari does — 
you can still remotely control your computer.
When you connect to the computer running VNC using a Web browser, 
the Web server sends a default page that contains a Java applet. That Java 
applet asks you for the password to connect; upon entering the correct 
password, it brings up the remote control session right in the Web browser.

N
owadays, wireless connectivity is king. For example, wireless phones 
have gone from being a toy of the technological elite to a permanent 
fixture on the hip of the common man. The shorts that I’m wearing right 
now have a special pocket just for a cell phone to ride in; when I’m without 
my phone, it usually carries a 5th Avenue candy bar. (Perhaps that was too 
personal . . . sorry.)
Because people have become accustomed to being able to keep in touch 
wherever they are, they also want to be able to have access to their network, 
at least within their house or workplace, without the hassle of cables. 
(Which, by the way, are magnets for pets that enjoy a good chew toy.) 
This desire for convenience and the advances in wireless technology have 
combined to bring you the concept of the wireless network — as well as 
wireless coffee shops, wireless access providers, and even wireless gaming 
centers. (In fact, Apple’s iPhone is a wireless Internet marvel, with instant 
connectivity to any Bluetooth-enabled Mac and full-featured e-mail and 
browsing that’ll knock your socks off.)
Now you can be connected to your home local area network (LAN) and 
your shared Internet connection (which I cover in Book VI, Chapter 4) from 
your balcony, deck, lounge chair in the yard, or even your bedroom. In this 
chapter, I talk about how wireless networks work, and then I give you a lot 
of information to help you get the right pieces to free yourself — securely, 
mind you — from the world of the wired.
Speaking the Wireless Lingo
Wireless networks aren’t all that different from their wired siblings. In this 
chapter, I discuss some of the features and limitations of wireless networking, 
but you must first be familiar with a foundation of information.

556
Speaking the Wireless Lingo
Because of the technology involved in wireless networks and how things 
are changing rapidly in this area, you’ll find yourself swimming in a sea of 
acronyms and other techno-babble. Although you don’t need to know every 
little detail to be able to set up your own wireless network, you should know 
some of these terms so that you can avoid getting stung by hackers or stuck 
with equipment that’s on the verge of obsolescence. 
Here’s a quick list of terms that you’ll see on your road to becoming a 
wireless network guru:
 
✦ WLAN: WLAN stands for Wireless LAN. If you’ve already read previous 
chapters in this minibook, you know that a LAN (local area network) is 
just a bunch of connected computers and other devices.
 
✦ IEEE: This stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 
which is an organization that approves standards that allow computers, 
network equipment, and just about anything else electronic to play 
nicely together. Sometimes IEEE helps create these standards before 
approving them, and sometimes it just approves standards that others 
have produced.
 
✦ 802.11: This is the part of the IEEE standards that deals specifically with 
wireless networking. 
 
 Although wireless is usually generically referred to as wireless networks 
(or sometimes even Wi-Fi), it’s all really a wireless form of Ethernet.
 
✦ Wireless access point: A wireless access point, or WAP, is a device that 
allows wireless network devices to connect to a wired Ethernet network.
 
✦ Service Set Identifier: The Service Set Identifier, or SSID, is used to tell 
your computer the name of the wireless network that you want to use.
 
✦ Wired Equivalency Privacy: Wired Equivalency Privacy, or WEP, is an 
encryption that wireless networks can use to keep your wireless net-
work more secure from snoopers and hackers.
 
✦ Wi-Fi Protected Access: Usually referred to as WPA, this is a security 
protocol that’s more robust and harder to crack than WEP. The latest ver-
sion, WPA2, is a common security feature on today’s wireless hardware. 
 
✦ Ad Hoc mode: An Ad Hoc wireless network is one in which each wireless 
device talks directly with all other wireless devices. 
 
 Apple calls Ad Hoc mode a computer-to-computer network.
 
✦ Infrastructure mode: This is where all wireless devices talk to a WAP, 
and the WAP then talks to other wireless devices and the wired network.
As I cover the different parts of wireless networking and how to set it up, 
you’ll find yourself using these terms over and over. Before you know it, 
you’ll be spouting these wireless-related acronyms like a pro. (No, really. I’m 
not kidding.)

Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Ethernet
Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Ethernet
One of the first things that you might notice when you start looking into 
wireless networking is the existence of different wireless standards. You 
should at least be aware that these different standards exist: That way, you 
can be sure to get wireless network components that will work together 
because some of the different wireless standards are not compatible. (Feel free 
to photocopy this list and stick it on your fridge door.)
Basic Wi-Fi: 802.11b
IEEE 802.11b has another name that you’ll likely see on product advertisements, 
literature, or boxes in stores: Wi-Fi, which stands for Wireless Fidelity. 
(Kinda like that cutting-edge Hi-Fi stereo from the ’60s and ’70s, where Hi-Fi 
stands for High Fidelity.) Most folks proclaim Wi-Fi as only 802.11b. Wi-Fi 
was the first version of wireless Ethernet. This version of wireless runs at 
speeds up to 11 million bits per second, or 11 Mbps. The reason I say that it 
runs at speeds up to 11 Mbps is because the actual speed at which the data 
is transferred depends on things like signal strength and quality. When the 
conditions are such that your signal strength or quality is decreased — 
such as an inconvenient concrete wall between you and your AirPort Base 
Station — you might find that your wireless connection changes down to 
5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, or even as slow as 1 Mbps.
802.11b has been largely supplanted in current wireless networking, and 
almost all the equipment you can buy today is either 802.11g or 802.11n 
(both of which I cover in a moment). However, if you’re working with older 
computers and existing 802.11b hardware, any networking equipment you 
buy should be backward compatible with 802.11b.
 
Apple’s AirPort network cards and standard-issue AirPort Base Station used 
802.11b. In fact, it’s time for Mac owners to swell with pride yet again: Apple 
was the first computer company to ship 802.11b hardware. (Back then, in 
1999, it was the original AirPort Base Station.) Now, of course, Apple has 
raised the bar with AirPort Extreme, which I discuss later in this chapter, 
and the AirPort Express mobile Base Station.
In theory, Wi-Fi network cards have the ability to communicate with other 
Wi-Fi devices and WAPs that are up to 1,000 feet away. Having said that, real-
ize that 1,000 feet is a generous estimate when outdoors on a clear day with 
no wind blowing — you see what I’m getting at. In reality, when you set up 
your wireless network, things such as walls — especially concrete walls, as 
in basements — and areas with lots of electrical wiring decrease the distance 
that you can cover. If you use a WAP, plan on no more than 150 feet between 
wireless computers and the WAP. However, your mileage might vary.

558
Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Ethernet
 
That 11 Mbps bandwidth is shared between all computers using it. Collisions 
can also occur if more than one computer tries to communicate at the same 
time. If you have a lot of people on your wireless network, the network will 
get noticeably slower because of increased collisions. Remember that the 
total bandwidth is shared among the computers on the wireless network. 
This applies not only to Wi-Fi but also to the 802.11a (which I cover in the 
nearby sidebar) and the 802.11g standards.
 
One last thing about 802.11b networking: Wi-Fi uses the 2.4 GHz frequency 
range. It actually uses 11 different channels, but they’re all around the 2.4 
GHz range. If you’re using a 2.4 GHz cordless phone or even a microwave, 
using either device can definitely interfere with or even shut down your 
wireless network. Keep this in mind when you buy your next phone or 
wonder why your file transfers stop when you’re communing with Orville 
Redenbacher in the microwave.
Let’s get Extreme: 802.11g
Apple’s release of the first generation of AirPort Extreme provided both the 
speed of 802.11a and the compatibility with Wi-Fi. That’s because it used the 
802.11g standard, which operates at speeds up to 54 Mbps (as did 802.11a) 
but will also operate at the same frequency ranges and play nicely with 
existing 802.11b equipment. (Notice that we’re heading in the right direction 
again when it comes to naming conventions. Go figure.)
 
Apple was once again the first company to offer 802.11g hardware as 
standard equipment. Feel free to enjoy the Superiority Dance yet again.
Naturally, there’s a downside: 802.11g returned to that pesky 2.4 GHz range, 
so your cordless phone and microwave can also wreak the same havoc that 
they did with your original AirPort equipment.
Raising the bar to 802.11n
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the current wireless standard from IEEE: 
802.11n. Most third-party manufacturers (including Apple) now offer only 
802.11n wireless equipment. Apple’s 802.11n products include the current 
AirPort Extreme base station, the AirPort Extreme hardware in most of the 
Macintosh computer line, and the spiffy Apple TV.
Why the hubbub? Oh, I forgot to mention that 802.11n can deliver throughput in 
excess of 100 Mbps! Don’t bet your house that you’ll get that kind of speed, 
though — as with the other members of the 802.11 family, that’s likely to be 
a theoretical maximum speed.
You can’t go wrong with the 802.11n standard: think superfast wireless 
connections in your household or office. Ahh, technology. . . .

Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
The guy with the turquoise teeth
I should also mention Bluetooth — a strange name for a wireless standard, I 
admit, but it works like a charm. Bluetooth devices use 2.4 GHz as well, but 
they’re designed only for very short distances . . . up to only about 30 feet. 
Bluetooth is the future for linking mobile devices (such as personal digital 
assistants and cell phones) and external peripherals (such as wireless 
keyboards and mice) to your Mac. In fact, Bluetooth is built in to all current 
Macs, which can turn your iMac or Mac Pro into a completely cordless 
machine — except for the power cord, of course. Snow Leopard provides 
built-in support for Bluetooth through the iSync application and the 
Bluetooth pane in System Preferences.
Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
Are you worried about the security of your AirPort wireless network? You 
should be, bunkie. Imagine someone in the next apartment or house — or 
standing right in your street — intercepting and monitoring your data from 
your wireless network.
802.11a was a newer version of wireless 
Ethernet than 802.11b. 802.11b came out first, 
and 802.11a came out next. (I guess someone 
ran into a doorframe.) 802.11a doesn’t have 
a generally recognized handy nickname like 
Wi-Fi, so just call it 802.11a.
802.11a equipment isn’t compatible with Wi-Fi 
or older 802.11b AirPort Base Stations, so don’t 
make the mistake of buying both 802.11b and 
802.11a network equipment. Instead, I strongly 
recommend that you follow the AirPort Extreme 
course charted by Apple and use the 802.11g 
or 802.11n standards (which are backward 
compatible with Wi-Fi). Just in case, the 
current AirPort Extreme base station (which 
uses 802.11n) does support 802.11a — hats off 
again to the folks in Cupertino!
802.11a can run at speeds up to 54 Mbps — 
almost five times faster than Wi-Fi. This is 
because 802.11a uses the 5 GHz frequency 
range instead of the cluttered 2.4 GHz range 
that Wi-Fi uses. The powers that be set aside 
the 5 GHz range just for wireless networking, 
so cordless phones and microwaves (or any 
other wireless devices, for that matter) can’t 
interfere with the network. The downside to 
using the higher 5 GHz range, though, is that 
the distances that can be covered are even 
less than that of Wi-Fi — no more than about 
60 feet to maintain the highest speeds.
Because of the incompatibilities with 802.11b 
and the arrival of 802.11g and 802.11n, 802.11a 
equipment has all but disappeared, and you 
should steer clear of it with a wide berth. (In 
fact, good luck finding 802.11a hardware any-
where but eBay.)
802.11a networks

560
Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
But before you decide to toss the idea of a wireless network, keep this in 
mind: Even though it is technically possible that someone might camp out 
on your doorstep in order to gain access to your wireless network, for most 
home networks, this possibility isn’t very probable. Even if someone tries 
to gain access to your wireless network and perhaps even sniff your 
network — a techno-nerd term meaning to record all the data flying around 
a network — there isn’t a whole lot someone can do with that information.
 
If a friend invites you for an evening of war driving, think “recreational 
mobile hacking.” War driving is the act of driving through neighborhoods in 
a car equipped with a laptop computer and a wireless network card. The 
payoff? If the hacker is lucky enough to locate a house with an open wireless 
network, we’re talking free wireless Internet access . . . from the comfort of 
his car! (Not to mention any shared files or information that’s available on 
that network.) Again, keep security in mind when installing wireless hardware, 
and these bozos will get nothing from your network.
You might say, “But I use my credit card on the Internet to buy stuff.” Sure, 
this is a valid concern; however, if you purchase things on the Internet with 
your credit card, you should already be using a secure connection provided 
by the Web site for your personal information so that the data you’re sending 
across your wireless network is already encrypted and relatively safe from 
thieves. (You can find more on this when I discuss Safari in detail in Book V, 
Chapter 5.)
“I have shared my files on my computer. Can the Bad Guys access those 
shared files?” Another good question, but if you read Book VI, Chapter 2, you 
know that you have to create an account for those whom you want to access 
your files. Unless the would-be hacker is very good at guessing usernames 
and passwords, your files are pretty safe, too.
This is not to say that you bear absolutely no risk of being hacked. If a 
legitimate user on your wireless network connects to your computer and 
starts transferring a file, a would-be hacker could potentially record all the 
traffic and then reconstruct the file that was sent from the data that was 
recorded. In other words, a hacker could grab that user’s username and 
password. That’s where WEP comes in.
WPA and WPA2
Wi-Fi Protected Access, or WPA, is A Good Thing (even if it makes for a silly-
sounding acronym). It’s currently the standard encryption protocol offered 
for home wireless networking — WPA2 standard is the latest version,— and 
is even better at defending your wireless network. As you might expect, all 
of Apple’s current AirPort wireless hardware uses WPA2 security, as does 
most of the wireless hardware you’ll find on the shelf at your local Hardware 
Heaven electronics store. (It’s still a good idea to check the specifications on 
the box, though, to make sure that WPA2 is supported.)

Book VI
Chapter 3
Going Wireless
561
Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
WPA2 works well as a deterrent to keep the wrong people out of your stuff. 
Although WPA2 isn’t going to ward off the spies at the National Security 
Agency, it’s good enough to protect home and small-business networks.
WEP
WEP is an old friend of mine. Short for Wired Equivalency Privacy, it’s 
another ridiculous acronym for another wireless security system. WEP 
was one of the first widely supported wireless encryption schemes, but in 
today’s world, WEP is now outdated and pretty easy for a hacker to outwit. I 
strongly recommend that your network use WPA2 whenever possible.
Apple’s implementation of WEP comes in two varieties: 40 bit and 128 bit. 
The more bits used in the encryption, the more secure (and the better) it is.
To use WEP, you need to select a WEP key, which is really just a code word:
 
✦ The longer the key, the better. 
 
✦ When making a key, use something like ab8sher7234ksief87 (something 
that’s random with letters and numbers) as opposed to something, like 
mykey, that’s easily guessed. 
If you’re using an Ad Hoc wireless network, all the computers need to have 
their wireless network card configured with the same WEP key in order to 
communicate. If you’re using a WAP to connect to the rest of the network, 
you need to use the same key on your computers that you’ve configured on 
your WAP.
 
One thing to note about WEP is that it’s been broken, meaning that someone has 
figured out how to undo the encryption that WEP provides. For businesses, 
especially those with sensitive data, WEP isn’t a good security solution.
The LEAP security standard
Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) is an encryption 
protocol developed by Cisco Systems for superior security in the business 
world. To use LEAP, you need to have a server that’s set up to enable users 
to log in to gain permission to the wireless network. After you initially log in 
(authenticate) to your network, LEAP changes encryption keys on the fly at 
a time interval that you determine. You could set it so that every 15 minutes 
your encryption key is changed: Even if someone is in that hypothetical tent 
on your front lawn, he could never record enough packets to figure out your 
key because it changes so often.
 
Setting up a server so that you can use LEAP isn’t something for the novice 
to attempt. I would encourage you to read up on LEAP only if you’re very 
serious about airtight security on your WLAN. The Cisco Web site (www.
cisco.com) is a good place to read about LEAP.

562
Setting Up Your Wireless Network
 
All current AirPort Extreme wireless network cards and Base Stations are 
compatible with the Cisco LEAP for higher security.
Setting Up Your Wireless Network
On to the good stuff. This section describes installing an AirPort Extreme 
card as well as how to set up an Ad Hoc or infrastructure-based WLAN 
(wireless LAN).
Installing an AirPort Extreme network card
All of today’s Macs come with an AirPort Extreme (802.11n) card built in. 
However, if your older Mac doesn’t have an AirPort card installed, you can 
usually add one yourself. Most Mac models made in the past four or five 
years without built-in wireless still have a slot for an AirPort or AirPort 
Extreme card. You just need to check www.info.apple.com/applespec 
to see whether your particular Mac can use an AirPort card.
 
In case you have any issues using AirPort or need more information 
about anything related to AirPort, check this page at the Apple Web site: 
www.apple.com/support/airport.
You should be able to use any standard 802.11b Wi-Fi, 802.11g, or 802.11n 
card, but you might run into some issues with drivers and such. Be sure that 
any non-AirPort/AirPort Extreme card that you might buy is backed up with 
Mac OS X drivers.
Various 802.11g/n wireless network devices are available, many of which 
come with drivers for the Mac. Some of these devices connect via a 
Universal Serial Bus (USB), which could be handy if you want to be able to 
move it between a Desktop Mac Pro or iMac to a MacBook and back 
(without the hassle of opening the case each time). Before you can set 
up your wireless network, you have to connect your wireless hardware. 
Because of the differences between manufacturers, check the installation 
instructions that come with whichever device that you choose.
After you have your AirPort, AirPort Extreme, or other 802.11b/g/n wireless 
network card or device installed, you’re ready to connect.
Setting up an Ad Hoc wireless network
Using an Ad Hoc network — also called a computer-to-computer network — is 
a fairly easy thing to accomplish in Mac OS X. Plus, you’re not limited to just 
Macs: With an Ad Hoc network, you can also swap niceties with PCs and 
PDAs that have 802.11b/g/n network interface cards (NICs) installed. This Ad 
Hoc network is great for setting up an impromptu network in a classroom, 
exchanging recipes and pictures at a family reunion in a park, or blowing 
your friend up while gaming across the aisle of a Greyhound bus at 70 mph.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Going Wireless
563
Setting Up Your Wireless Network
To set up an Ad Hoc network, you first have to create the computer-to-
computer network on one of your Macs. This takes advantage of the AirPort 
Software Base Station that’s built into Snow Leopard. 
To create a computer-to-computer network, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the AirPort status icon on the menu bar.
 
 If you haven’t set Snow Leopard to display your AirPort status in the 
Finder menu bar, follow these steps:
 
a. Open the Network pane in System Preferences and choose the AirPort 
entry in the list at the left of the pane. 
 
b. Enable the Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar check box.
 
c. Close the System Preferences window to save your changes.
 
2. Click Create Network to display the dialog that you see in Figure 3-1.
 
3. Enter a name for your network.
 
4. Mark the Require Password check box to turn on WEP encryption.
 
5. Enter a password for your network and then enter it again to confirm it.
 
 Although you can leave encryption disabled, I highly recommend that 
you turn it on and choose a password for that extra bit of security. (Just 
call me Security Man.) Note that the password must be an exact length 
(which is determined by whether you choose a 40-bit [5-character] key 
or a 128-bit [13-character] key).
Because of Apple’s implementation of wireless 
standards within the AirPort Extreme product 
line, keep in mind some things when trying to 
mix Apple wireless equipment with other ven-
dors’ 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n equipment. As 
you discover elsewhere in this chapter, using 
AirPort wireless networks can require a WEP 
password that corresponds to the 802.11b/g/n 
WEP key for encryption. However, the password 
that you enter for AirPort networks isn’t 
exactly the same as the WEP key for that 
same network. If you’re using an AirPort 
network card and are trying to connect to a 
non-Apple WAP, you need to follow a specific 
procedure. You can find this procedure by 
going to http://search.info.apple.
com and searching on the words 802.11 
Compatibility. You’ll also find helpful information 
at this same spot if you’re using a non-Apple 
802.11b/g/n network card and are trying to 
connect to an Apple AirPort Base Station. (If 
you’re using WPA2 encryption, no special 
configuration is needed. Go figure.)
You want my opinion? Because of the issues 
of using non-AirPort 802.11b/g/n hardware 
with The Real Thing (AirPort/AirPort Extreme 
stuff), I recommend that you stick with Apple 
equipment if possible.

 In general, channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ones that don’t overlap 
other channels — and are therefore the best choices to use. If you’re 
close to other WAPs, AirPort Base Stations, or other Ad Hoc networks, 
try to find a channel that’s not being used, or performance can be 
degraded. (If you have only one access point, it doesn’t matter which 
channel you select — just allow Snow Leopard to automatically select a 
channel, which is typically Channel 11.)
 
6. Click OK.
Creating a computer-to-computer network gives the illusion of having an 
AirPort Base Station. So for people to join your network, they would follow 
the same steps as those they would use to join any other AirPort network, as 
I cover in the next section.
Setting up wireless networks with 
an AirPort Base Station
After one computer is running a computer-to-computer network or you’ve 
set up and configured an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station, you’re ready 
to invite other computers with wireless hardware to the party.
Joining in an existing AirPort network
After you have a network set up on one of your wireless-enabled computers, 
you just need to have the other wireless-enabled computers join that network. 
You can use the same process, as I describe here, to join any wireless network:
 
1. Click the AirPort status icon on the menu bar.
 
 A list of existing network connections appears in the AirPort menu.
 
2. Select an existing network connection that you’d like to join.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Going Wireless
565
Setting Up Your Wireless Network
 
 If you want to join a network whose name doesn’t appear in the list — 
also called a closed network — follow these steps:
 
a. Select Join Other Network from the AirPort status menu.
 
b. Enter the name of the network that you want to join and the password 
(if any is required). 
 
 A closed network is another added measure of security — one that’s 
good enough for most people because it’s very unlikely that a hacker is 
going to try to hack a hidden network.
Disconnecting from an AirPort network
To disconnect from an AirPort/AirPort Extreme network, you can turn off 
your AirPort card altogether, which I cover in the next section. (Simplicity, 
they say, is an art.) Another way is to simply connect to another AirPort 
network — but this option is really only useful if you actually want to 
connect to another network.
Turning your AirPort hardware on or off
Being able to turn your AirPort/AirPort Extreme hardware on and off 
actually has its uses:
 
✦ You might want to use your Mac, usually your laptop, in a place where 
your wireless card shouldn’t be used, like 
 
• An airplane (when they tell you to turn off all cell phones) 
 
• A hospital area that doesn’t allow cell phones or other wireless 
devices
 
✦ Turning off your AirPort/AirPort Extreme hardware conserves your 
MacBook’s battery life. 
To turn your AirPort equipment on or off via the AirPort status icon on the 
menu bar, give it a click and choose Turn AirPort On/Off from the resulting 
menu.

Chapter 4: Sharing That 
Precious Internet Thing
In This Chapter
✓ Finding out how Internet sharing works
✓ Choosing between hardware and software Internet sharing
✓ Connecting your Macs to a cable/DSL router
✓ Adding wireless support to a shared Internet connection
A
lthough I discuss lots of fun stuff that you can do with your network in 
previous chapters, this has to be my favorite: sharing a single Internet 
connection between all the computers on your network. If you have more 
than one computer, I’m sure that you’ve had to deal with the dilemma that 
pops up whenever more than one person wants or needs to access the 
Internet at the same time.
Luckily, because small home and office local area networks (LANs) use our 
old friend TCP/IP for network communications, connecting an entire network 
to the Internet isn’t as troublesome a task as you might think. In this chapter, I 
talk about different hardware and software options for sharing your Internet 
connection as well as how to include your wireless devices.
Sharing the Internet
Sharing a single Internet connection among all your computers can be a 
boon simply because of the reduced chances of random acts of violence. 
(Internet deprivation can be an ugly thing, you know.) Although I won’t 
claim that Internet sharing will save lives, it can indeed save you from 
headaches and arguments when more than one person wants to use the 
Internet at one time.
 
Throughout this chapter, I talk a lot about cable modems and Asynchronous 
Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) modems. Both of these are high-speed 
Internet connections — and both are relatively inexpensive — that are 
offered by your local cable company and your local phone company, 
respectively. The phone company offers different kinds of digital subscriber 
line (DSL) connections, the most common of which is ADSL. However, 
because different kinds of DSL connections exist, in this chapter I refer to 
them all generically as DSL.

568
Using Network Address Translation
To share your Internet connection, you need a few things, so here’s a brief 
checklist:
 
✦ An Internet connection: Typically, this is a cable or DSL modem 
connection, but older versions of the AirPort Base Station can use a 
dial-up Internet connection that’s accessed via a standard v.90/v.92 
analog telephone modem. (Note that recent models of the AirPort 
Extreme Base Station do not have the capability to use analog dial-up 
connections.)
 
✦ A LAN: You need a standard LAN (which is connected with cables) or 
a wireless LAN. (Heck, you can even have a hybrid that has both wired 
and wireless access.) See Book VI, Chapter 1 for more information 
about setting up a LAN and Book VI, Chapter 3 for more on setting up a 
Wireless LAN (WLAN).
 
✦ An Internet-sharing device: I use the word device because the method 
that you use to share your Internet connection could be through software 
that you run on one of your computers or hardware that is stand-alone, 
depending on how you connect to the Internet and what best fits your 
needs.
When you have these three things ready to go, you can share your Internet 
connection. However, you need to know some background information to 
help you choose the right components and get everything up and running.
Using Network Address Translation
You must determine one thing before you start your Internet sharing quest: 
the set of network Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that you’ll use. If you 
used Book VI, Chapter 1 to set up and configure your LAN, you might recall 
that I suggest a specific range of IP addresses to use on your LAN. In case 
you missed out on Chapter 1 of this minibook, I briefly cover this important 
topic again so that you can share your Internet connection smoothly. 
(Forgive me if I wax technical, but ’tis only for the moment.)
When talking about IP addresses, the ruling body that tracks IP addresses 
and where they’re used has broken all IP addresses up into two parts:

Book VI
Chapter 4
Sharing That 
Precious Internet 
Thing

Using Network Address Translation
 
✦ Public IP addresses: Public IP addresses are used to communicate on 
the Internet, and only one device in the entire world can use a given 
public IP address at any given time.
 
✦ Private IP addresses: Private addresses, on the other hand, are supposed 
to be used only on networks (such as your home LAN) and do not 
connect directly to the Internet. Lots of people can use the same private 
address because their networks never go public; that is, they never 
directly access the Internet, so their IP addresses never conflict.
Typically, you’ll use addresses in the form of 192.168.x.x on your LAN. See 
Book VI, Chapter 1 for an overview of IP addresses and how they work.
You might be wondering to yourself thusly: “If I use private IP addresses 
on my LAN at home or in the office and I have to use a public IP address to 
communicate on the Internet, how can my private IP addresses on my LAN 
communicate with public IP addresses on the Internet?” That is an excellent 
question, and the answer is Network Address Translation (or NAT, for short).
NAT acts as a gatekeeper between your private IP addresses on your LAN 
and the public IP addresses on the Internet. When you connect to the 
Internet, your Internet service provider (ISP) gives you one — and usually 
only one — public IP address that can be used on the Internet. Instead of one 
of your computers using that public IP address and depriving all the other 
computers on the LAN, the hardware or software that you use to share the 
Internet will take control of that public IP address. Then, when any computer 
on your LAN tries to communicate on the Internet, your NAT software/
hardware intercepts your communications and readdresses the traffic so 
that it appears to be coming from your allotted public IP address. (Think of a 
funnel that collects water from several different sources and then directs all 
the water into a single stream.)
When the Web site, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, or whatever strange 
Internet intelligence you’re using on the Internet replies, it replies to your 
NAT device. The NAT device remembers which private IP address it should 
go to on the LAN and sends the information to that computer. See NAT at 
work in Figure 4-1.

Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
After you have an Internet connection and your LAN is set up, you need 
something to make this NAT thing work. You have two different options to 
take care of NAT for your shared Internet connection: hardware or software. 
(Go figure.) Each has pros and cons, so take a look at each option individually.
 
If you read Chapter 3 of this minibook, you know that Snow Leopard has 
AirPort software built in. So, if you have an AirPort Extreme wireless net-
work card in your Mac and you’re using Snow Leopard, you can have your 
Mac act like an AirPort Extreme Base Station for all the wireless computers 
on your network, which in turn can use a software NAT.
Using hardware for sharing an Internet connection
Probably the most popular way to share an Internet connection is to buy a 
hardware device that connects to your Internet connection, which then 
connects to your LAN. These devices are referred to as cable/DSL routers. 
The main downside to a hardware Internet connection-sharing device is that 
it costs more than a software solution.

Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
Cable/DSL routers are nice because they’re easy to set up and configure. 
Too, you can leave them on, which means constant Internet access for those 
on your LAN. You don’t have to worry about turning on another computer 
to connect to the Internet as you do with a software solution. Sounds like a 
good spot for a Mark’s Maxim: 
 
Hardware routers are the best choice for sharing your Internet connection, 
so if you can afford one, you should get one!
Apple’s AirPort Extreme Base Station is not only a Wireless Access Point 
(WAP) for your network, as I discuss in Chapter 3 of this minibook, but also 
acts as an Internet connection-sharing device. (AirPort Express can’t share 
an Internet connection . . . sorry.) Some older flavors of AirPort Base Station 
even have a built-in v.90 modem for sharing a single 56 Kbps connection 
using a dialup account! A base station typically has several Ethernet 
connections for sharing a high-speed Internet connection, including a 
dedicated port to connect to a cable/DSL router and two or four ports to 
connect to other computers on the LAN.
If you think that a cable/DSL router or an AirPort Extreme Base Station could 
be the karma pathway for you to achieve your goal of sharing your Internet 
connection, here are some things to consider when deciding which device to 
buy for your LAN:
 
✦ Do you need a switch? Most cable/DSL routers have a small 3-, 4-, or 
5-port switch built in. See Chapter 1 of this minibook to discover more 
about hubs and switches. This multiport capability is nice because the 
same cable/DSL router that shares your Internet connection is also the 
centerpiece of your LAN where all your connections meet, thus saving 
you from having to buy a switch on top of the cost of the cable/DSL 
router.
 
 Some cable/DSL routers, however, have only a single Ethernet connection 
to connect to your LAN. So keep in mind that if you choose a device with 
a single LAN connection, you must supply your own switch that would 
then connect the cable/DSL router to the rest of your LAN.
 
✦ Got modem? If your only Internet connection is through a dial-up 
modem account, look for a built-in analog telephone modem on your 
cable/DSL router. You must have this feature if you want to use a hard-
ware device to share your Internet connection. (Again, older versions of 
the AirPort Base Station are great for this because the modem is built in, 
but you’ll have to do some shopping on eBay.) Even if you have cable/
DSL service, some ISPs also include a dial-up account with your broad-
band access. With such a bountiful selection of connections, you can 
plug in your cable or DSL service to the cable/DSL router as well as use 
the dial-up account as a back-up in case your main service has problems.

572
Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
 
✦ Want a printer with that? Some cable/DSL routers also have a port for 
connecting a printer — a great feature to have because it allows you to 
leave the printer connected and turned on so that anyone on the network 
can print to it anytime. (This is much better than connecting the printer 
to a computer and sharing it because then the computer doing the 
sharing must always be on in order to make the printer available.) Mac 
OS X can send a print job to a printer by using Bonjour or TCP/IP, so 
just make sure that your printer is compatible with TCP/IP printing, also 
called LPR (Line Printer Remote).
Using software for sharing an Internet connection
As I mention earlier, if you’re using Mac OS X Snow Leopard and have an 
AirPort or AirPort Extreme wireless network card installed, your Mac can 
act like an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station, providing both wireless 
Ethernet connectivity for other computers on the LAN and a shared Internet 
connection.
Snow Leopard also has built-in software that allows a single computer on 
your network to share its Internet connection with others on the LAN. To 
share your Internet connection, follow these quick steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon.
 
3. Click the Internet Sharing entry at the list on the left side of the pane.
 
 This brings up the settings, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 
4. Click the Share Your Connection From pop-up menu and choose 
Ethernet.
 
5. Select the Ethernet check box (in the To Computers Using list) to 
enable it.
 
 When you do, you’re issued a warning that enabling this could affect 
your ISP or violate your agreement with your ISP. In my experiences, this 
step has never caused any networking problems. However, if you have 
any doubts, contact your ISP and verify this.
 
6. Click OK in the warning dialog to continue.
 
 You go back to the Sharing dialog, where you’ll notice that the Internet 
Sharing check box is conveniently ready for you to select it — feel free 
to click it now.
If you’re using a dial-up modem to access the Internet, you need to also 
make sure that the computer that has the modem also has an Ethernet or 
wireless LAN connection. Unfortunately, none of the latest Mac models have 
a built-in modem, but if you buy an external USB modem from Apple (or a 
third-party vendor), you can still use this feature.

Figure 4-2:

If you’re using a cable or DSL modem for your Internet connection, the Mac 
that you want to run the sharing software on should have two Ethernet 
connections: one to connect to the cable/DSL modem and one to connect to 
the rest of the LAN.
The main disadvantage to using a software solution for Internet connection 
sharing is that the computer that connects to the Internet must be turned 
on and ready to go all the time so that others on the network can get to the 
Internet. And although the sharing software operates in the background on 
the machine it’s running on, it still chews up some of that Mac’s processing 
power and memory, so it could slow down other applications that you’re 
running on that computer.
Connecting Everything for Wired Sharing
After you decide whether to use a software or hardware solution, it’s time 
to get your hands dirty: All the pieces of the puzzle must be set up and 
connected. In this section, I tell you how to connect things for either the 
software or hardware method of sharing the Internet connection.
Using the software method
When you use the software method to share your Internet connection, one 
of the computers on your network has both the connection to the Internet 
and a connection to the LAN. Figure 4-3 shows a typical setup for software 
Internet sharing, whether you’re using a dial-up modem account or a cable/
DSL modem for your Internet connection.

Keep in mind, though, that when using a cable/DSL modem for your Internet 
connection, the computer running the sharing software must have two 
Ethernet connections.
Using the hardware method
Not only does using a dedicated piece of hardware free one of the Macs on 
your network from the onerous job of hosting the shared connection, but it 
also keeps you from having to have more than one Ethernet connection on a 
single computer if you’re using a cable/DSL modem for your Internet access. 
Figure 4-4 shows how you would connect your devices for hardware Internet

Connecting Everything for Wired Sharing
sharing by using either a cable/DSL router with a built-in Ethernet switch or 
a cable/DSL router with a stand-alone Ethernet switch, as you would need to 
use AirPort or AirPort Extreme.
If you choose to buy a cable/DSL router that has a built-in Ethernet switch, 
you can simply connect all your computers on the LAN to the built-in switch. 
However, if you buy a cable/DSL router that has only a single LAN connection, 
as with older versions of the AirPort Base Station, you must connect that 
single LAN connection to an external hub or switch in order to get all the 
computers on the same network.

Adding Wireless Support
 
We’re talking wired Ethernet here — of course, wireless connections don’t 
require a port on your router or base station. (More on this in the next 
section.)
 
Regardless of whether you use the hardware or software method to share 
your Internet connection, all the computers on your LAN — except the one 
that’s doing the sharing, if you’re using software sharing — should be 
configured to obtain its IP address automatically through our old friend, 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). (See Chapter 1 of this 
minibook for details on how to do this in Snow Leopard.) Although it’s not a 
requirement that you set up your other devices with DHCP, it’s recommended 
unless you understand the IP addressing scheme required by your cable/
DSL router and you’re willing to set up the addresses manually. You need to 
follow the instructions that come with the cable/DSL router or software that 
you purchase for detailed information on how to configure that.
Adding Wireless Support
You might have noticed that I mention wireless here and there in this 
chapter. This section covers in a bit more detail how you can add wireless 
capabilities to your shared Internet party. To discover more about how 
wireless networks work and how to set up one, see Book VI, Chapter 3.
Basically, you can encounter a couple of situations when trying to add 
wireless capabilities into the mix. Either you already have an Internet 
connection-sharing mechanism in place (either hardware or software), 
or you don’t yet have your Internet connection shared.
If you already have a cable/DSL router or 
are using software Internet sharing
If you already have a cable/DSL router or if you’re using software Internet 
sharing, like that built into Snow Leopard, you can simply buy a WAP (short 
for Wireless Access Point) and connect it to your LAN. Adding a WAP enables 
anyone using wireless Ethernet access to your network and thus to your 
shared Internet connection.
There are many WAPs that you can buy to add wireless to your network. 
AirPort Extreme is a good example; however, because AirPort Extreme also 
can do Internet sharing, make sure that you don’t enable Internet sharing 
through software on your Mac! (In this case, you don’t want or need this 
feature because it can conflict with your cable/DSL router operation.)

Book VI
Chapter 4
Sharing That

577
Adding Wireless Support
If you do not have a cable/DSL router 
or an AirPort Extreme Base Station
If you don’t have a cable/DSL router or an AirPort Extreme Base Station for 
Internet sharing, you have a few options. Each option has an upside and a 
downside.
One option is to get an AirPort Extreme Base Station, which provides both 
wireless access for AirPort-enabled wireless computers and Internet sharing 
for the entire network. Because today’s AirPort Extreme Base Stations also 
feature three built-in Ethernet ports for wired connections, you won’t need 
an additional switch to connect up to three Macs using Ethernet cables.
The other option is to buy a combination cable/DSL router, which has a 
built-in WAP. Most cable/DSL routers — including the ones that have wireless 
built in — also have multiple Ethernet ports on them, so connecting 
computers by using wired Ethernet can be done without buying an external 
switch.
The final option is that you can use the AirPort software built into Snow 
Leopard to turn your Mac into an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station, as 
I discuss earlier. This is a great, low-cost way to add wireless and Internet 
sharing to your network, but remember that the software will still eat 
up processor time and memory. For more on wireless networking, read 
Chapter 3 of this minibook.

ardware. We love it. To a Mac power user, new hardware holds all the 
promise of Christmas morning, whether your new toys are used for 
business or for pleasure. We pore over magazines and visit our favorite Mac 
Web sites like clockwork to check on new technology.
These hardware devices don’t come cheap, however, forcing you to make 
the painful decision regarding which new hardware you really need in order 
to accomplish what you want and which hardware is a luxury. Also, if you’re 
a new Mac owner, you might not know what’s available. For example, I con-
stantly get e-mail from readers, asking, “What can I connect to my new com-
puter?” I guess I could reply, “Why, the kitchen sink!” To that end, I decided 
to add this chapter to the book to let you know how you can expand the 
hardware for your Mac OS X Snow Leopard powerhouse.
Each section in this chapter provides a description of what a particular 
device does, an idea of how much it costs, and a set of general guidelines 
that you can use when shopping. Although this isn’t in-depth coverage — 
after all, the book is supposed to be about Snow Leopard — it will serve to 
get you started if you’ve just become a Mac owner. If you’re especially 
interested in a specific piece of hardware, I recommend other books that 
you can read for the exhaustive details.
Ready? To quote a great line from the first Batman film: “Alfred, let’s go 
shopping!”

Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, 
DV Camcorders, and Scanners
The first category of hardware toys revolves around images — hardware for 
creating original images, capturing images in real time, and reading images 
from hard copy.
Digital cameras
A digital camera shares most of the characteristics of a traditional film 
camera. It looks the same, and you use the same techniques while shooting 
photographs. The difference is in the end result. With a digital camera, 
instead of a roll of film that has to be developed, you have an image in JPEG, 
RAW, or TIFF format that’s stored on a memory card. The contents of the 
memory card can be downloaded to your Mac from within iPhoto (which 
I discuss with great pleasure in Book III, Chapter 3) and then the real fun 
begins. Here are some things that you can do with a digital photograph:
 
✦ Edit it with an image editor such as Adobe Photoshop Elements
 
✦ Print it with an inkjet, dye-sublimation, or color laser printer
 
✦ Record it to a CD or DVD
 
✦ Add it to a Web page
 
✦ Print several of them in a coffee-table book (using iPhoto)
 
✦ Mail it to friends and family
What they cost
Consumer-level digital cameras typically sell for anywhere from under $100 
(for a 7-megapixel [MP] model) to $300 (for a 10MP point-and-shoot camera). 
Megapixel is a general reference to the resolution (the size of the image, 
measured in individual dots called pixels) and detail delivered by the 
camera. Such digital cameras can produce photographs that are well suited 
for just about any casual shutterbug. Professional digital cameras, which 
capture far more detail and offer designs that more closely resemble the 
best SLR film camera, can set you back $600 or $1,000. Because of their 
cost and complexity, I wouldn’t recommend them to someone who’s just 
discovered digital photography.
What to look for
Here are some general guidelines that I recommend when selecting a digital 
camera:
 
✦ At least a 7MP camera: As a general rule, the higher the megapixel 
value, the better the camera.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Hardware That Will 
Make You Giddy
583
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
 
✦ At least a 1GB internal memory card: The memory card stores the 
images that you capture.
 
✦ A Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0 connection to your Macintosh: I cover 
USB in all its glory in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
 
✦ An optical zoom feature: Optical zoom allows you to draw closer to 
subjects that are farther away.
 
 Note that I recommended optical zoom there and not digital zoom. 
Essentially, digital zoom is a silly feature that simply resizes a portion 
of your image, providing a blocky close-up. In fact, an image editor like 
Photoshop Elements can produce exactly the same result as a camera 
with digital zoom . . . and it looks almost as bad. Only an optical zoom 
results in a sharper magnification of the subject.
 
✦ A self-timer: With a self-timer, your camera can snap a photo automatically, 
allowing you to finally be seen in your own pictures!
 
✦ A manual flash setting: Although automatic flash is a good thing most 
of the time, a manual setting allows you to disable your camera’s flash 
for artistic shots (or just to prevent the glare on subjects with polished 
surfaces).
DV camcorders
Like digital cameras, digital video (DV) camcorders are the counterpart 
to the familiar video camcorder. A DV camcorder looks and operates like 
an analog VHS camcorder, but you can connect it to your Macintosh via a 
FireWire or USB cable and download your video clips directly into iMovie. 
Today’s crop of DV camcorders can also record in High Definition (HD for 
short) for your widescreen TV or monitor. (Chapter 4 of Book III explains all 
about iMovie, and FireWire is tackled in Chapter 3 of this minibook.)
Besides the higher quality of digital video, it has a number of other real 
advantages over analog video:
 
✦ Digital video can be edited with applications such as iMovie or Final Cut 
Express.
 
✦ Digital video can be recorded to a CD or DVD.
 
✦ Digital video can be posted for downloading on a Web page.
What they cost
A typical DV camcorder starts at about $200, including camcorders that 
record directly to a blank DVD and record in HD.
What to look for
I recommend the following when shopping for a DV camcorder:

584
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
 
✦ The highest optical zoom in your price range: Again, as with a digital 
camera, it’s important to be able to capture subjects and action when 
you can’t get any closer — think the lion exhibit at the zoo.
 
✦ Image stabilization: This helps steady the picture when you’re holding 
the camcorder without a tripod.
 
✦ Onboard effects: These effects generally include some snazzy things like 
black-and-white footage, fades, and wipes.
 
✦ AV connectors: Use these to display your video by connecting the 
camcorder directly to your TV.
 
✦ Digital still mode: This enables you to take still photographs if your 
digital camera isn’t handy; however, the image quality isn’t as good as a 
bona fide digital camera.

iDVD ’09 For Dummies by Dennis R. Cohen and Michael E. Cohen (Wiley).
Scanners
Figure 1-1 illustrates a typical flatbed scanner, which is the tool of choice for 
those Macintosh owners who want to digitize images and text from printed 
materials. Although you can also connect a sheet-fed scanner, flatbed 
models are much more versatile and produce better-quality scans.
 
Figure 1-1: 
The flatbed 
scanner, 
King of 
Digitizing.
 
Images produced by a scanner can be edited, mailed, displayed on the Web, 
or added to your own documents, just as the images from a digital camera 
can be.
What they cost
A good-quality scanner should cost anywhere from $50–$300, with the best 
models — featuring the fastest scanning speeds, best color depth, and 
highest resolutions, or those meant for scanning film negatives — going for 
around $500.

Book VII

585
Incredible Input: Keyboards, Trackballs, Joysticks, and Drawing Tablets
What to look for
Try to get the following features in a scanner:
 
✦ The highest color depth that you can afford: Get a minimum of 48-bit.
 
✦ The highest resolution that you can afford: Get a minimum of 2400 dots 
per inch (dpi) (optical).
 
✦ Single-pass scanning: This feature results in a faster scan with less 
chance of error.
 
✦ Transparency adapter for scanning film negatives: If you’re a tradi-
tional film photographer, you’ll find that a transparency adapter turns a 
standard flatbed scanner into an acceptable negative scanner.
 
✦ One-touch buttons for e-mailing your scanned images or uploading 
them to the Web: These are controls of convenience — pressing one of 
these buttons automatically scans the item and prepares the image to 
be e-mailed or uploaded to a Web site.
 
✦ USB 2.0 or FireWire connection: I cover the advantages of both in 
Chapter 3 of this minibook.
 
Another shameless (but good-natured) plug: My bestselling book Scanners 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley) offers comprehensive coverage of all types 
of scanners, as well as chapters devoted to advanced features, image editing, 
and step-by-step projects.
Incredible Input: Keyboards, Trackballs, 
Joysticks, and Drawing Tablets
Although your Mac is already equipped with a keyboard and a mouse, you 
can replace them with enhanced hardware that will add functionality and 
precision to your work. (Or you can buy a joystick and spend your days 
wreaking havoc on your enemies.)
Keyboards
If you’re using the latest Intel iMac or Mac Pro tower model, you don’t really 
need to upgrade your keyboard. These new machines come with excellent 
keyboards already, replete with volume controls and a Media Eject key. 
However, if you’re using an older Macintosh — or you have a Mac mini or 
MacBook and you want to add an external keyboard — you can take advantage 
of the convenience of a USB keyboard like the one in Figure 1-2.

What they cost
Aftermarket (nonstandard-issue) keyboards generally cost anywhere from 
$30–$100.
What to look for
Look for the following keyboard features when shopping for a keyboard:
 
✦ Programmable buttons: Configure these to launch applications or run 
macros.
 
✦ Additional USB ports: Use these to turn your keyboard into a USB hub.
 
✦ One-touch buttons to launch your browser or e-mail application: Press 
one of these buttons to launch your Web browser or Mail.
 
✦ Ergonomic wrist pad: Use these to help prevent wrist strain and 
repetitive joint injuries.
Trackballs
Some folks prefer using a trackball, like the one shown in Figure 1-3, over a 
mouse any day . . . even the Mighty Mouse now included with Mac desktops. 
Graphic artists find that trackballs are more precise and offer better control, 
usually including a secondary button to display contextual menus. (One 
model on the market has eight buttons. Who needs a keyboard?)

power users 
(myself 
included)

trackball 
over a

What they cost
Trackballs range in price from $20–$90. Most are optical (see the following 
section), so they need little cleaning, and they’ll last for many years of 
precise pointing at things.
What to look for
Look for the following features when shopping for a trackball:
 
✦ More programmable buttons: Opt for at least two buttons!
 
✦ Optical tracking: An optical trackball — one that doesn’t use rollers, 
instead using a photo-sensitive sensor to record the movement of the 
ball — is more precise and easier to keep clean.
 
✦ A scroll wheel: Use this gizmo to scroll documents up and down.
 
✦ Ergonomic design: Look for a wrist pad or slanted buttons.

Joysticks
Game players, unite! For arcade and sports games, using a joystick results 
in increased maneuverability, more realistic action, higher scores, less wear 
and tear on your keyboard . . . and just plain more fun. Joysticks range from 
the traditional USB aircraft controller, as shown in Figure 1-4, to USB con-
trollers and gamepads that rival anything offered on today’s console game 
machines.
 
Figure 1-4:

weapon 
of Mac 
gaming — a 
joystick.
 
What they cost
Joysticks vary in price from $30–$120. At the low end, you’ll usually find the 
gamepad-type controllers, whereas aircraft controllers carry the highest 
price tag.
What to look for
Get the following features in a joystick:
 
✦ Yet even more programmable buttons.
 
✦ Pitch and yaw controls. These are for the flight simulator crowd.
 
✦ Force feedback. A force feedback joystick or gamepad rumbles and 
moves in tandem with the action in the game, providing an extra feeling 
of realism.

Drawing tablets
A drawing tablet like the one you see in Figure 1-5 might be pricey, but if 
you’re a graphic artist or a designer, using a tablet will revolutionize the 
way that you work with your Mac. Rather than use a mouse or trackball 
to sketch, you can draw on the tablet freehand, just as you would draw on 
paper or canvas. Tablets can recognize different levels of pressure, allowing 
applications, such as Photoshop and Painter, to re-create all sorts of photo-
realistic brush effects.
 
Figure 1-5: 
Professional 
artists and 
designers

the graphics 
tablet.
 
What they cost
Depending on the size of the tablet and the pressure levels that you need, 
you’ll pay anywhere from just under $100 to a whopping $500.
What to look for
I recommend the following tablet features:
 
✦ Programmable buttons: See a trend here?
 
✦ Accessory mouse: Some high-end tablets include a mouse that you can 
use along with the tablet.
 
✦ A cordless stylus: Make sure that it doesn’t require batteries.
 
✦ The highest number of pressure levels possible: The more levels 
that the tablet offers, the more subtle and precise your control is over 
painting effects.

Sublime Storage: CD/DVD Recorders
Sublime Storage: CD/DVD Recorders
Ready to talk storage? Consider a rewriteable DVD-RW drive which can store 
4.7GB on a single disc, or dual-layer drives, which can store 8.5GB! (And 
don’t even get me started on the next generation of optical technology — the 
Blu-ray recorders — they can store 50GB on a single disc!)
 
If you’d like to trade data with another Mac or a PC via floppy disks, you can 
get an external USB floppy drive for under $50; however, I personally eschew 
floppy disks, which are very unreliable and carry a mere 1.44MB of data. Pick 
up a USB Flash drive instead.
All recent Mac models (except the MacBook Air) include a rewriteable 
DVD-RW SuperDrive — but if your computer is older and didn’t come 
equipped with a recorder (or you want the latest Blu-ray storage capacity), 
you can always add an external model.
What they cost
A FireWire DVD-RW drive averages about $100.
What to look for
Get the following features in an external DVD recorder:
 
✦ An internal buffer of at least 8MB: The larger the buffer, the less 
chance that you’ll encounter recording errors and the faster your drive 
will burn.
 
✦ At least 16X DVD recording speed: A no-brainer here. The faster the 
recording speed, the less time you’ll wait for the finished disc.
 
✦ AC power through the USB 2.0 or FireWire cable: This eliminates the 
need for a separate AC power supply.
 
✦ Burn-proof technology: This virtually eliminates recording errors 
because of multitasking so that you can continue to work on other 
applications while you record.
Awesome Audio: Subwoofer Systems 
and MP3 Hardware
Although virtually all Macs ship with speakers, I’ll be honest — the “stock” 
speakers don’t measure up to the standards of a true audiophile. For those 
who really enjoy their music and their game audio, this last section covers 
the world of Macintosh aftermarket sonic enjoyment.

Subwoofer speaker systems
The ever-popular USB port again comes to your rescue. This time, it enables 
you to connect a more powerful speaker system with a subwoofer. In case 
you’ve never heard a subwoofer — think chest-rattling thump, thump, 
thump — you should know that they provide the basement-level bass that 
can add power and punch to both your music and your games. Being hit by 
an asteroid is a rather flat, tinny experience with a pair of battery-powered 
speakers that you salvaged from your Walkman years ago. With a new set of 
speakers and a subwoofer, you’ll swear that Han Solo is sitting in the cockpit 
chair next to you!
With the growing importance of the computer as a replacement for your 
home entertainment center, investing in a more powerful set of speakers 
will help you enjoy all those audio CDs and MP3s that you’ve added to your 
iTunes Playlists. (Read all about iTunes in Book III, Chapter 2.)
What they cost
Most USB-powered speakers with a subwoofer are priced below $100, but 
true audiophiles looking for surround sound can spring for a better $300 
system that includes five satellite speakers and a subwoofer.
What to look for
Get these features in a subwoofer:
 
✦ At least 30 watts of power: The higher the wattage rating, the more 
powerful the speakers (and the louder your music can be).
 
✦ Additional headphone jacks and stereo mini-plug input jacks: Use 
these for connecting your iPod or MP3 player directly to your speaker 
system. (Read all about iPods in the next section.)
 
✦ Magnetic shielding: This helps prevent your speakers from distorting 
your monitor display.
MP3 players (well, actually, just the iPod)
I’ve lusted after Apple’s iPod MP3 player ever since it arrived on campus. 
Depending on which model you get, this incredible device can hold up to 
120GB of digital audio — that’s over 30,000 songs — as well as digital 
photographs and full-length movies! Plus, the iPod also acts as your personal 
data butler by carrying your files; it’s an honest-to-goodness, external USB 
2.0 hard drive. In fact, if you pick up an iPod Shuffle, it acts as a USB Flash 
drive. You can download your contacts and appointments from Mac OS X 
and view them wherever you go. Just think: Carry your files to and from 
your office and carry Devo and the Dead Kennedys and watch a movie you 
downloaded as well! Oh, and did I mention that you can play games and use 
all sorts of applications with the iPod Touch model?

592
Awesome Audio: Subwoofer Systems and MP3 Hardware
All this fits into a beautiful, stylish package about the size of a pack of 
cigarettes, with up to a 36-hour lithium rechargeable battery, high-quality 
earbud headphones, and automatic synchronization with your iTunes music 
library. (The iPod Shuffle is the smallest member of the iPod family — it’s 
less than 2 inches tall.) Life just doesn’t get any better for a technoid like 
me. If you think that your Mac is a well-designed piece of equipment, you’ll 
understand why this little box is so alluring. (And why I have one now.)
Sure, other MP3 players are out there, but many of them share the same 
following problems:
 
✦ They use digital memory cards, which offer far less capacity than the 
iPod.
 
✦ They use standard batteries, or you have to furnish rechargeable 
batteries (which don’t last 36 hours).
 
✦ They don’t operate as an external hard drive, photo slideshow 
repository, movie theater, or contacts/appointment database.
I say forget ’em. The iPod is worth every cent that you’ll pay.
The 4GB iPod Shuffle is less than $80 at the time of this writing, while the 
8GB iPod nano runs $149 and the 120GB iPod video model costs $249.

M
ost Macintosh owners will make two upgrades — adding more 
memory (RAM) and additional hard drive space — during the lifetime 
of their computers. These two improvements have the greatest effect on the 
overall performance of Mac OS X. By adding RAM and additional hard drive 
space, not only do you make more elbow room for your applications and 
documents, but everything runs faster: Think of the Six Million Dollar Man, 
only a heck of a lot cheaper to operate (and no strange noises accompanying 
your every move).
In this chapter, I steer you around the hidden potholes along the way for 
those who aren’t well versed in selecting memory modules or weighing the 
advantages of different types of hard drives. However, if you buy the wrong 
piece of hardware, remember that using a hammer to make it fit is not a 
workable option.
Adding Memory: Reasons for More RAM
Of all the possible upgrades that you can make to your Macintosh, adding 
more random access memory (RAM) is the single most cost-effective 
method of improving the performance of Mac OS X. (In fact, your machine 
will likely run faster with more memory than a reasonably faster processor!) 
Here is exactly what Mac OS X uses available RAM for:
 
✦ Applications: Naturally, Mac OS X needs system RAM to run the 
applications that you launch. The more memory in your machine, the 
larger the applications that you can open and the faster they’ll run.

594
Adding Memory: Reasons for More RAM
 
✦ Overhead: This includes the operating system itself, as well as various 
and sundry buffers and memory areas devoted for temporary work. As 
you would guess, the more memory here, the merrier.
 
✦ Virtual memory: Aha! Now here’s something that I mention lightly and 
politely in Book I but hasn’t really amounted to a hill of beans until this 
moment. (Can you tell I’m a big fan of Bing Crosby?) Virtual memory 
allows Mac OS X to use empty hard drive space as temporary system 
memory, as shown in Figure 2-1. Data is written to your hard drive 
instead of being stored in RAM, and then it’s erased when it’s no longer 
needed. This is a neat trick that’s also used by Windows and Linux. 
Virtual memory works automatically within Mac OS X.

real RAM!

At first, virtual memory sounds like absolute bliss, and it does indeed allow 
your Macintosh to do things that would otherwise be impossible, such as 
running an application that requires 2GB of RAM in just 1GB of actual 
physical RAM. However, here come the caveats:
 
✦ Virtual memory is as slow as molasses in December. Even today’s fastest 
hard drive is many, many times slower than real silicon, so any use of 
virtual memory instead RAM slows down Mac OS X significantly.
 
✦ Virtual memory abuses your hard drive. If you’ve ever run Photoshop 
on a Windows PC with 128MB of RAM, you’re having flashbacks right 
now. Whenever your Macintosh is using virtual memory, your hard drive 
remains almost constantly active. (Hardware types, like myself, call this 
phenomenon thrashing because we know what’s happening inside that 
poor hard drive.) Over time, running any computer with insufficient 
RAM and behemoth applications will result in a significant increase in 
hard drive wear and tear.
 
✦ Virtual memory costs you processing power. With sufficient RAM, Mac 
OS X gleefully runs as efficiently as it can. When virtual memory kicks in, 
however, your Mac has to spend part of its quality time shuttling data 
to and from the hard drive, which robs your computer of processing 
power.

Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
The moral of the story is very simple, so it’s time for another of Mark’s 
Maxims:
 
The less Mac OS X needs to use virtual memory, the better.
To put it another way, physical memory (meaning memory modules) is 
always a better choice than virtual memory. This is why power users and 
techno-types crave as much system memory as possible.
 
A little over five years ago, 128MB of RAM was a quite comfortable figure 
for most folks, but all of today’s Macs can accept at least a whopping 4GB 
(that’s short for gigabyte, or 1,024 megabytes) of system RAM. (At the 
extreme end of the scale, the King Kahuna — Apple’s latest Mac Pro — can 
now accommodate an unbelievable 32 gigabytes of RAM!)
If you’ll be keeping your current Macintosh for a few years more, install as 
much memory as you can afford — you’ll thank me every time Mac OS X 
Snow Leopard boots.
Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
Before you click some online computer store’s Buy button, you need to 
determine two things that will help you determine which memory module to 
buy: how much RAM you already have and how much more your system can 
handle.
Finding out the current memory in your Mac
Memory modules are made in standard sizes, so you need to determine 
how much memory you already have and which of your memory slots are 
filled. To do this, open the Apple System Profiler by clicking the Apple menu, 
choosing About This Mac, and then clicking the More Info button.
After you launch this application, it takes a few seconds to scan your 
Macintosh and display all sorts of identifying information about the hardware 
and software that you’re using. Check out the Memory item in the Hardware 
section. Here you can see exactly how many memory modules you have, 
what type they are, and how much memory each provides. For example, 
in Figure 2-2, my iMac has two memory slots — labeled Bank0/DIMM0 and 
Bank1/DIMM1. Both those slots are filled to the brim with a 1GB module 
each, giving me a total physical memory of 2048MB, or 2GB. Jot down the 
name and contents of each slot on a piece of paper — or, if you’re a real 
Mac OS X power user, add a Sticky to your Desktop with this information. 
(Stickies are covered in Book II, Chapter 2.)

596
Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
 
Figure 2-2: 
Look under 
the hood 
with Apple’s 
System 
Profiler.
 
However, on some machines, only one memory module can be upgraded by 
a mere mortal. For example, on many older Mac mini models, DIMM0 is an 
internal module and can be upgraded only by an Apple technician. (Insert 
sound of harps playing here.)
Unfortunately, this arrangement differs on just about every model of 
Macintosh ever made — some have more memory slots, and others allow 
you to upgrade all the system memory instead of just one module. The only 
way to determine which modules are accessible on your Mac is to identify 
the exact model of your computer.
Determining the exact model of your computer
Most folks know the type and model of their computers, but there’s a catch 
here, too: Sometimes the memory that you need varies by the processor in 
your Macintosh. For instance, many different versions of iMacs have been 
made since the Bondi Blue Beast debuted, and over the course of those 
years, Apple has made a slew of changes inside. Your eye should be on 
the actual processor speed and bus speed — the transfer speed that data 
reaches whilst speeding across your motherboard — because they’re the 
identifying factors here. An older iMac with a 2 GHz Intel Core Duo processor, 
for example, will use a different type of memory from the latest iMac with a 
3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor.
Again, your salvation turns out to be Apple System Profiler. Just click the 
Hardware section to display both the machine speed (or processor speed) 

Book VII
Chapter 2
Add RAM, Hard 
Drive Space, and 
Stir
597
The Tao of Hard Drive Territory
and the bus speed. (For example, my machine has a 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo 
CPU running at 677 MHz bus speed.) Grab that same piece of paper (or open 
that same Sticky) and add these two figures to your list.
Now you’re armed with the information that you need to go online and buy 
the right memory — or, if you’d rather work directly with a human being, 
you can visit your local Apple dealer, present that most august personage 
with the list, and have the memory upgrade ordered for you.
 
Buying memory online is much cheaper. I recommend the following online 
stores:
 
✦ MacMall: www.macmall.com
 
✦ MacWarehouse: www.cdw.com
 
✦ MacConnection: www.macconnection.com
The Tao of Hard Drive Territory
Next, turn your attention to the other popular Mac upgrade — adding extra 
hard drive space. With today’s cutting-edge, 3-D games using a gigabyte of 
space each and Photoshop CS4 expanding to a minimum of 2GB, IDC (short 
for Insidious Data Creep) is a growing problem. (Bad pun most certainly 
intended.)
You can save space by deleting those files and folders you don’t need, but 
what fun is that? To reduce your Mac’s waistline before you consider adding 
more room, I recommend using Spring Cleaning from Smith Micro Software, 
which you can find at mysmithmicro.com. It’s a great tool for locating 
duplicates, removing empty folders, and uninstalling old programs that you 
no longer use.
To determine how much free space remains on a hard drive, click the drive’s 
icon on your Desktop and press Ô+I to display its information, as shown in 
Figure 2-3. (I’m a major-league Mozart fan-boy, hence the name of my hard 
drive.)
As a general rule, the following factors indicate that you’re ready to upgrade 
your hard drive territory:
 
✦ You have less than 10GB of space on your current hard drive.
 
✦ You’ve cleaned all unnecessary files, and your Mac is still lagging behind 
in storage.
 
✦ You need to share a large amount of data between computers that aren’t 
on the same network. (Read on to discover why.)

598
Internal versus External Storage
 
Figure 2-3: 
Checking 
your drive’s 
free space.
 
Internal versus External Storage
Most people who upgrade their existing hard drive do so because they 
need extra space; however, you might also need to add a hard drive to your 
system that can go mobile whenever necessary. Unlike an internal drive — 
which resides hidden inside your Mac’s case — an external drive is a lean, 
mean, self-contained traveling storage machine that’s perfect for road warriors.
External drives
 
External removable cartridge drives, such as a REV drive from Iomega (www.
iomega.com), are perfect for folks who have to send cartridges to other 
locations. Unfortunately, however, the capacities of these drives are rapidly 
falling behind conventional, nonremovable external hard drives. Also, all 
modern Macs now have a DVD-R drive, which make it easy to send up to 9GB 
of data through the mail. Therefore, if you’re considering an external unit, 
go with the most popular pick — a high-capacity nonremovable hard drive, 
which offers the most storage for your dollar.
Most external drives are shock-mounted (meaning that they can take more 
abuse than an internal hard drive), and they carry their own power supply. 
In fact, some external drives actually don’t need a separate power supply 
because they draw their power through your Mac’s Universal Serial Bus (USB) 
or FireWire port. (The next chapter in this minibook tells all about USB and 
FireWire.) You can also use a superfast external SATA drive with a MacBook 
Pro if you invest in a SATA card adapter for your laptop’s ExpressCard/34 slot.
External drives also have a number of other advantages:
 
✦ No installation hassle: You can easily install a USB or FireWire drive in 
seconds. Simply plug in the drive to the proper connector on the side 

Book VII
Chapter 2
Add RAM, Hard 
Drive Space, and 
Stir
599
Internal versus External Storage
or back of your Mac, connect the power supply (if necessary), and turn 
it on. (No software installation necessary. As the folks in Cupertino are 
fond of saying, “Look, Ma — no drivers!”)
 
✦ No extra space needed: Many Macs simply don’t have the internal space 
for another drive — laptops, iMacs, and the Mac Mini are good examples. 
Therefore, if you want to keep your existing internal drive as-is while 
you’re adding more storage, an external drive is your only choice.
 
✦ File sharing with ease: With an external drive, you can share your data 
between multiple computers or bring your files with you on your next trip.
 
✦ Safe from prying eyes: Unlike an internal drive, external drives are easy to 
secure. Take your sensitive information home with you or lock it in a safe.
After you plug in an external drive, Mac OS X displays it just like any other 
hard drive volume. Figure 2-4 illustrates my 60GB FireWire drive in action.
 
Figure 2-4: 
A typical 
FireWire

Internal drives
Your other alternative is to upgrade your internal drive, which can be a 
hassle. As does a memory upgrade, adding or swapping an internal drive 
involves opening your Mac’s case. In fact, it’s a somewhat more complex 
procedure than adding memory.

600
Determining How Much Space You Need
 
I usually recommend that folks add a second drive rather than swap out 
their existing drive. You’ll avoid the hassle of backing up and restoring 
your system on a new drive or (even worse) reinstalling Mac OS X and then 
reinstalling all the applications that you use. (Swapping a hard drive should 
be the definition of the word hassle.) Instead, add a second drive and leave 
your current hard drive as-is.
However, here are a number of very important reasons why many Mac 
owners choose updating internal drives, even with the hassle of swapping:
 
✦ They’re cheaper. You’ll spend significantly less on an internal drive 
because it doesn’t need the case and additional electronics required by 
an external drive.
 
✦ They’re faster. Even a FireWire or USB 2.0 drive isn’t as fast as an 
internal drive.
 
✦ They take up less space in your work area. An internal drive eliminates 
the space taken by an external drive, which can range anywhere from 
the size of a paperback to the size of a hardback book.
After you establish that you are in fact ready for more space — and you’ve 
decided whether you want to add an internal drive, an external drive, or (if 
you enjoy punishment) upgrade your existing internal drive — you’re ready 
to consider how big of a drive you need.
Determining How Much Space You Need
Your next step is to decide just how much hard drive space is enough. I 
suppose that if your last name is Gates and you had something to do with 
that Windows thing, you can probably pick just about any drive on the market. 
However, I have a family, a mortgage, a car payment, and lust in my heart for 
the latest computer games; therefore, I must be a little more selective.
I have two hard-and-fast rules that I follow when I’m determining the 
capacity of a new drive:
 
1. If you’re buying a replacement for your existing drive, shop for a drive 
with at least twice the capacity of the existing drive (if possible).
 
2. If you’re buying an external drive, shop for a drive with at least the same 
capacity as your existing internal drive (if possible).
Those rules seem to work pretty doggone well in most circumstances, with 
these two exceptions: gamers and digital video gurus. These folks need to 
shoehorn as much space as they possibly can into their systems. If you’re 
a hardcore gamer or if you work primarily with digital video, you need a 
wheelbarrow’s worth of hard drive capacity. Trust me: Buy the biggest hard 
drive that you can afford.

Installing Your New Stuff
Shopping for a Hard Drive
Ready to brave the local Wireless Shed superstore (or perhaps its Web site)? 
Here’s a list of guidelines to keep handy while you’re shopping for a new 
internal or external hard drive:
 
✦ Faster is indeed better. You’ll pay more for a 10,000 revolutions per 
minute (rpm) drive than a slower 5,400 or 7,200 rpm drive, but the extra 
cash is worth it. Faster drives can transfer more data to your Mac in less 
time, especially if you’re replacing your Mac’s internal Serial ATA drive.
 
 Faster drives are especially important for storing digital video.
 
✦ Serial ATA and EIDE drives are different. If you’re replacing your 
internal drive, you have to get the same type of drive that you already 
have: EIDE or Serial ATA. (EIDE is a common parallel ATA standard hard 
drive used in PCs and older Macs.) Again, System Profiler can tell you 
which type of drive your Mac is currently using.
 
✦ Avoid used or refurbished drives. Hard drives are one of the few 
components in your computer that still have a large number of moving 
parts. Therefore, buying a used drive isn’t a good idea unless it’s priced 
very low.
 
 Because the prices on new hard drives are constantly dropping, make 
sure that you check on the price for a new, faster drive of the same 
capacity before you buy that bargain used drive.
 
✦ Pick FireWire over USB. Compared with a FireWire connection, a USB 
2.0 external hard drive is less efficient and slightly slower. Because most 
Macs with USB ports also have FireWire ports, make very sure that you 
buy a FireWire drive! (If your Mac has USB 2.0 ports, which will show 
up in System Profiler as well, you can buy a USB 2.0 drive without being 
embarrassed. Or invest in a drive that has both FireWire and USB 2.0 
connectors!)
 
✦ Watch the size of the drive when buying internal drives. Most SATA 
(Serial ATA) and EIDE (Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics) drives 
are standard half-height 3.5-inch units, but check to make sure that 
you’re not investing in a laptop drive — unless, of course, you’re 
upgrading a laptop.
Installing Your New Stuff
After you get your memory modules or hard drive, pick one of two methods 
of installing them: easy or hard. Guess which method will cost you money?

602
Installing Your New Stuff
The easy way
Your Apple dealer can perform either type of hardware installation for you. 
You can rest easy knowing that the job will be done right, but money will 
definitely change hands.
 
Personally, I always recommend that owners of MacBook and MacBook Pro 
laptops allow their dealers to install hard drives because these laptops are 
much more complex than a desktop, and they’re much easier to damage. 
(The Mac mini is a bear to work on, as well.)
The hard way
If you’re familiar with the inside of your Macintosh, you can install your own 
upgrade and save that cash. A memory upgrade is one of the simpler chores 
to perform, but that doesn’t mean that everyone feels comfortable taking the 
cover off and jumping inside a computer; hard drives are a tad more complex.
 
If you have a knowledgeable friend or family member who can help you 
install your hardware, buy him the proverbial NSD (short for Nice Steak 
Dinner) and enlist him in your cause. Even if you still do the work yourself, 
it’s always better to have a second pair of experienced eyes watching, 
especially if you’re a little nervous.
Because the installation procedures for both memory modules and hard 
drives are different for every model of Mac — heck, even removing the 
cover on each model of Macintosh involves a different challenge — I can’t 
provide you with any step-by-step procedures in this chapter. Many online 
stores include installation instructions with their hardware. Other sources 
for installation instructions include the Apple Web site (www.apple.com) 
and your Apple dealer. You can use Safari’s Google search feature to scan 
the Internet for installation information for your particular model. However, 
here are guidelines to follow during the installation:
 
✦ Watch out for static electricity. When opening your Macintosh and 
handling hardware, make certain that you’ve touched a metal surface 
beforehand to discharge any static electricity on your body. (You can 
also buy a static wrist strap that you can wear while working within the 
bowels of your Mac.)
 
✦ Check the notches on memory modules. Most types of memory modules 
have notches cut into the connector. These notches make sure that you 
can install the module only one way, so make certain that they align 
properly with the slot.
 
✦ Make sure you’re using the right memory slot. As I mention earlier in 
this chapter, most Macs have multiple memory slots, so check the label 
on the circuit board to make sure that you’re adding the memory to the 
correct slot. (Naturally, this won’t be a problem if you’re installing a 
module into an unoccupied slot.)

module or hard drive with a new one, put the old hardware in the 
leftover anti-static bag from your new hardware and immediately start 
thinking of how you’ll word your eBay auction . . . Used 1GB Memory 
Module for Intel iMac, for example.
 
✦ Check your hard drive jumper settings. If your Mac uses EIDE hard 
drives, you must set the Master and Slave jumpers correctly on the 
back (or underside) of the new drive. A jumper is simply a tiny metal-
and-plastic connector that is used to change the configuration on a hard 
drive. Setting jumpers indicates to your Mac which drive is the primary 
drive and which is the secondary drive. (I don’t know how engineers 
got into the whole Master/Slave thing . . . they’re normally not quite so 
exotic when naming things.)
 
 If you’re adding a second drive to a desktop with an EIDE drive, you’ll 
probably have to change the jumper settings on the original drive as 
well. (If you’re replacing the existing drive, you’re in luck; simply 
duplicate the jumper settings from the old drive and use them on the 
new drive.) Because the configuration settings are different for each 
hard drive model, check the drive’s documentation for the correct 
jumper position.
 
✦ Leave the cover off while testing. After you install the upgrade, leave 
the cover off your Mac (if possible) while you boot the computer and 
test to see how well you did. That way, if you have to replace the original 
hardware for some reason, you won’t have to remove the cover a 
second time.
 
To determine whether a memory upgrade was successful, you can again 
turn to the Apple System Profiler. Open the Profiler again and compare the 
memory overview specifications with the original list that you made earlier. 
If the total amount of memory has increased and the memory module is 
recognized, you’ve done your job well. If not, switch off the Mac and check 
the module to make sure it’s completely seated in the slot.

Chapter 3: Port-o-Rama: 
Using USB and FireWire
In This Chapter
✓ Using FireWire under Mac OS X
✓ Using USB under Mac OS X
✓ Adding a USB or FireWire hub
✓ Troubleshooting FireWire and USB connections
✓ Adding and updating drivers
A
pple’s list of successes continues to grow over the years — hardware, 
applications, and (of course) Mac OS X — but the FireWire standard 
for connecting computers to all sorts of different devices is in a class by 
itself. That’s because FireWire has been the port of choice for all sorts of 
digital devices that need a high-speed connection. Even Windows owners 
have grudgingly admitted that FireWire just plain rocks. Ya gotta love it.
In this chapter, I discuss the importance of FireWire to the digital hub that I 
discuss in Book III, and I compare it with both version 1.1 and version 2.0 of 
Intel’s Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection technology. I also talk trouble-
shooting and expansion using a hub.
Appreciating the Advantage of a FireWire Connection
So what’s so special about FireWire, anyway? Why does Apple stuff at least 
one FireWire port in almost all of its current Macintosh models? (The 
exceptions are the MacBook Air and some MacBook models.) Heck, even 
the iPod (Apple’s MP3 player, which you can read more about in Book III, 
Chapter 2) originally used only a FireWire connection. (Its official name is 
IEEE 1394, but even the Cupertino crew doesn’t call it that — at least not 
very often.)
First things first. As countless racing fans will tell you, it’s all about the 
speed, my friend. The original FireWire 400 port delivers 400 Mbps (megabits 
per second), which is fast enough for all sorts of peripherals to communicate 
with your Macintosh. The following list includes a number of hardware toys 
that are well known for transferring prodigious file sizes:

606
Appreciating the Advantage of a FireWire Connection
 
✦ Digital video (DV) camcorders
 
✦ High-resolution digital cameras
 
✦ Scanners and some printers
 
✦ External hard drives and CD/DVD recorders
 
✦ Networking between computers
For example, consider the sheer size of a typical digital video clip captured 
by one of today’s DV camcorders. DV buffs commonly transfer several hun-
dred megabytes of footage to their computers at one time. Check out the 
relative speeds of the different types of ports in Table 3-1, and you’ll see a 
big attraction of FireWire and USB 2.0 connections.

Ouch! Not too hard to figure that one out. Here are three other important 
benefits to FireWire:
 
✦ Control over connection: This is a ten-cent term that engineers use, 
meaning that you can control whatever gadget you’ve connected using 
FireWire from your computer. This is pretty neat when you think about 
it; for example, you can control your mini-DV camcorder from the comfort 
of your computer keyboard, just as though you were pressing the buttons 
on the camcorder.
 
✦ Hot-swapped: You don’t have to reboot your Mac or restart Mac OS 
X every time that you plug (or unplug) a FireWire device. Instead, the 
FireWire peripheral is automatically recognized (as long as the operating 
system has the correct driver) and ready to transfer.
 
✦ Power through the port: FireWire can provide power to a device 
through the same wire — typically, enough power is available for an 
external drive or recorder — so you don’t need an external AC power 
cord for some FireWire devices. (Apologies to owners of DV camcorders, 
but those things eat power like a pig eats slop.)

Port-o-Rama: Using 
USB and FireWire

Understanding USB and the Tale of Two Point Oh
However, FireWire isn’t finished evolving yet — the cleverly named IEEE 
1394 B (called FireWire 800 by anyone with any sense, including the folks 
at Apple) delivers a whopping 800 Mbps. That, dear reader, oughta be fast 
enough for both you and your loved ones. These ports appear on most of the 
top-of-the-line Apple desktop and laptop models at the time of this writing.
Oh, and as you would expect from Apple, the new ports will be backward-
compatible with older FireWire hardware. However, the ports aren’t exactly 
the same, so you’ll need a plastic port converter to connect FireWire 400 
devices to a FireWire 800 port. (Such important little conversion fixtures 
are commonly called dongles. No, I’m not making that up. Ask your favorite 
techno-wizard.)
Understanding USB and the Tale of Two Point Oh
The other resident port on today’s Apple computers is the ubiquitous USB, 
which is short for Universal Serial Bus. (By the way, ubiquitous means 
ever-present or universal, which I quickly looked up by using my Dictionary 
widget — read all about this super sleuth in Book VIII, Chapter 1.) USB has 
taken the world by storm. It’s used for everything from mice to keyboards, 
speakers, digital cameras, and even external drives and DVD recorders. (A 
friend of mine never misses the chance to point out that USB — which was 
originally developed by Intel, the makers of the Core 2 processor — was given 
its first widespread implementation on the original iMac. You’re welcome, Intel.)
Unfortunately, those last two are somewhat problematical: Technically, 
you can add a USB 1.1 external hard drive, but don’t expect response times 
anywhere near what you’d enjoy with an internal hard drive (think more 
along the lines of a floppy drive). Ditto for a CD recorder — 4X is about the 
limit for the recording speed with a USB 1.1 connection. (Don’t even think 
about recording DVDs over a USB 1.1 connection.) Now, compare this 
performance with that of similar equipment using a FireWire connection, 
which provides nearly the speed of an internal hard drive and CD and DVD 
recording at the fastest pace possible.
As is FireWire, USB connections are hot-swappable and may provide power 
over the connection. (Some USB ports don’t supply all the power that 
devices need — more on this later in this chapter.) A USB port offers a more 
limited version of Control over Connection as well, making it a good choice 
for virtually all digital cameras.
Not to be outdone, a USB 2.0 specification arrived several years ago that 
delivers performance comparable to the original FireWire standard: USB 2.0 
can transfer 480 Mbps, although far less efficiently than FireWire, so 
the FireWire connection is still faster overall. These ports are backward 
compatible — meaning they work with the original USB 1.1 ports as well. 
(Don’t call Apple a snob . . . at the time of this writing, all the Mac models in 
Apple’s current stable have USB 2.0 ports.)

608
Hey, You Need a Hub!
Hey, You Need a Hub!
Suppose that you’ve embraced FireWire and USB and you now have two USB 
2.0 drives hanging off the rear end of your Mac — and suddenly you buy an 
iPod. (Or you get another USB device that’s as much fun as an iPod, if that’s 
actually possible.) Now you’re faced with too many devices for too few 
ports. You could eject a drive and unhook it each time that you want to 
connect your iPod, but there must be a more elegant way to connect. Help!
Enter the hub. Both the FireWire and USB specifications allow you to 
connect a device called a hub, which is really nothing more than a glorified 
splitter adapter that provides you with additional ports. With a FireWire or 
USB hub at work, you do lose a port; however, most hubs multiply that port 
into four or eight ports. Again, all this is transparent, and you don’t need to 
hide anything up your sleeve. Adding a hub is just as plug-and-play easy as 
adding a regular FireWire/USB device.
I should also mention that FireWire supports daisy-chaining — a word that 
stretches all the way back to the days of the Atari and Commodore computers, 
when devices had extra ports in the back so that additional stuff could be 
plugged in. However, not every FireWire drive has a daisy-chain port (also 
called a passthru port). With daisy-chaining, you can theoretically add 63 
FireWire devices (or 127 USB devices) to your Mac — talk about impressing 
them at your next Mac user group meeting!
Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
Man, I hate it when FireWire and USB devices act like boat anchors. FireWire 
and USB peripherals are so doggone simple that when something goes 
wrong, it really aggravates you. Fortunately, I’ve been down those roads 
many a time before, so in this section, I unleash my experience. (That 
sounds a little frightening, but it’s a good thing. Really.)
Common FireWire and USB headaches
Because FireWire and USB are so alike in so many ways, I can handle 
possible troubleshooting solutions for both types of hardware at one time:
 
✦ Problem: Every time I turn off or unplug my external peripheral, Mac 
OS X gets irritated and displays a nasty message saying that I haven’t 
properly disconnected the device.
 
 Solution: This happens because you haven’t ejected the peripheral. I 
know that sounds a little strange for a device like an external hard drive 
or a digital camera, but it’s essentially the same reasoning as ejecting 

Book VII
Chapter 3
Port-o-Rama: Using 
USB and FireWire
609
Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
a CD or DVD from your Desktop. When you click your USB or FireWire 
device and hold the mouse button down, you see that the Trash icon 
turns into an Eject icon; drag the device icon to the Eject icon and drop 
it, and the external device disappears from your Desktop. (You can 
also click the device icon to select it and press Ô+E. And don’t forget 
the right-click menu . . . right-click the device and choose Eject.) At that 
point, you’re safe to turn it off or unplug the FireWire/USB cable.
 
 If Snow Leopard recognizes the device as an external drive, which is 
usually the case with a digital camera, external hard drive, or external 
CD/DVD recorder, you can simply click the Eject button next to the 
device icon in the Finder window’s sidebar.
 
✦ Problem: The device doesn’t show a power light.
 
 Solution: Check to make sure that the power cable is connected — 
unless, of course, you’ve got a device that’s powered through the 
connection itself. This can sometimes pose its own share of problems, 
however, when using USB devices. Not all USB ports provide power 
to devices because some are designed only for connecting mice, 
keyboards, and joysticks.
 
 To check whether an unpowered USB port is your problem, either 
connect the device to a USB port on your Mac or connect it to a hub or 
another computer. If the device works when it’s connected to another 
port, you’ve found the culprit.
 
✦ Problem: The device shows a power light but just doesn’t work.
 
 Solution: This can be because of problems with your cable or your hub. 
To check, borrow a friend’s cables and test to see whether the device 
works. If you’re testing the hub, try connecting the device directly to 
your Mac using the same cable to see whether it works without the hub.
 
 If you’re attempting to connect a FireWire device through another 
FireWire device, try connecting that first device directly to see whether 
it works. If so, the middleman device either needs to be switched on to 
pass the data through or it doesn’t support daisy-chaining at all — in 
which case, you may be able to place the “problem” device at the end of 
the chain. Of course, you can always connect both devices directly to 
your Macintosh as well.
 
✦ Problem: Mac OS X reports that I have a missing driver.
 
 Solution: Check the manufacturer’s Web site and download a new copy 
of the USB or FireWire drivers for your device because they’ve been 
corrupted, overwritten, or erased entirely. Because Mac OS X loads the 
driver for a USB or FireWire device when it’s connected, sometimes just 
unplugging and reconnecting a peripheral will do the trick.

610
Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
Check those drivers
Speaking of drivers . . . old and worn-out drivers are a sore spot with me. 
Drivers are simply programs that tell Mac OS X how to communicate with 
your external device. Each new version of Mac OS X contains updated driv-
ers, but make certain that you check for new updates on a regular basis. That 
means using both the Software Update feature in Mac OS X (which I cover 
briefly in Book II, Chapter 3 and much more in Book I, Chapter 7) and going to 
the Web sites provided by your USB and FireWire hardware manufacturers.

Chapter 4: I’m Okay, 
You’re a Printer
In This Chapter
✓ Adding a local printer
✓ Adding a non-USB printer
✓ Managing print jobs
✓ Sending and receiving faxes
✓ Setting up a shared printer
O
f all the improvements made in Mac OS X over Mac OS 9, one of the 
most important is the simplified printing process — no Chooser, no 
strange printer ports . . . just a heap of Universal Serial Bus (USB) and network 
and Bluetooth printing goodness. As I discuss in Book I, Chapter 3, if your 
USB printer is recognized by Snow Leopard, you can print within seconds of 
plugging it in, with no muss or fuss. A USB printer is connected physically 
to your Mac, but you can also send print jobs over the network to a network 
printer or even to a wireless printer. (Unfortunately, if that network printer is 
in another room, you do have to get out of your comfortable chair to retrieve 
your printed document . . . not even Snow Leopard is that powerful.)
But what if you want to send documents to a printer over TCP/IP (Transmission 
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)? To take care of tasks like that, you 
need to dig a little further — and I do so in this chapter. You also discover 
here how to use the features of the System Preferences Print & Fax pane and 
how to juggle print jobs like a circus performer.
Meet the Printer Browser
The Printer Browser runs automatically whenever it’s needed by Snow 
Leopard, but you can always summon it at any time by clicking the plus sign 
(or Add) button on the Print & Fax pane within System Preferences.

612
Meet the Printer Browser
 
If your USB printer is already natively supported (has a preloaded driver in 
Snow Leopard), you might not need to go through the trouble of clicking the 
Add button on the Print & Fax pane. Mac OS X can add a new USB printer auto-
matically, so don’t be surprised if your Mac swoops in and does it for you as 
soon as you plug in a new printer. Also, the manufacturer’s installation pro-
gram for your printer might add the printer for you in a behind-the-scenes 
way, even if Mac OS X lies dormant.
Although the Printer Browser doesn’t look like much (as shown in Figure 4-1), 
power lurks underneath.
 
Figure 4-1:

plain-
looking

is actually

Along the top of the Printer Browser, you’ll find four toolbar icons that will 
display the different types of printer connections possible in Snow Leopard. 
From the Browser, you can add these printers to your system. The four 
buttons are
 
✦ Default: Click this button to add or display the entry for the default 
printer, which always appears in bold type.
 
 To choose your default printer that you’ve already added, click the 
Default Printer pop-up menu in the Print & Fax list and choose that 
printer. You can also choose the Last Printer Used option, which 
automatically makes the default printer the last printer you used.

✦ Fax: Click this button to add a fax connection as a printer selection. 
If you don’t want to use Snow Leopard’s built-in faxing system, you 
can print directly to a third-party fax program, such as FAXstf Pro 
(www.smithmicro.com), which then dials, connects, and sends the 
document to a fax machine.
 
✦ IP: Click this button to add a remote printer to your Mac through an 
Internet connection or a local network connection. Sending a job to an 
Internet Protocol (IP) printer actually shoots the document across a 
network or Internet connection by using a target IP address or domain 
name. Generally, it’s best to have a static (unchanging) IP address for a 
network printer; if the IP address changes often, for example, you have 
to reconfigure your connection to your IP printer each time it changes.
 
✦ Windows: Click this button to add a shared printer that’s connected to 
a PC on your local network. “Hey, I get to use the enemy’s printers, too?” 
That’s right, as long as a Windows user on your network has shared his 
printer (via the ubiquitous Windows File and Printer Sharing feature). 
Sweet.
 
Oh, and there’s one additional important control on the toolbar that isn’t 
actually a button: You can click in the Search field and type text to locate a 
particular printer in any of these dialog lists. (Personally, I don’t have that 
many printers on my network, but in a larger company, this field can save 
you the trouble of scrolling through several pages of shared printers.)
Speaking of third-party Mac OS X printer 
drivers, the most popular example of same 
is the Adobe Acrobat printer driver, which is 
installed by Adobe Acrobat and used to create 
electronic PDF documents. Although you 
certainly can install Adobe Acrobat under 
Snow Leopard, I’d be remiss if I didn’t 
mention that you don’t have to! That’s because 
the operating system provides built-in support 
for printing documents in Adobe’s PDF format 
(which can then be viewed and printed on any 
other computer with Acrobat Reader or added 
to your Web site for downloading). Acrobat has 
more features, naturally, but — wait for it — 
don’t pay for Acrobat unless you need it!
In fact, you don’t even have to install a PDF 
print driver or display the Printer Browser! To 
print a document as a file in PDF format, click 
the PDF drop-down button in the application’s 
Print dialog, click Save as PDF from the menu, 
navigate to the desired folder and enter a 
filename, and then click Save.

Adding a Funky Printer
Adding a Funky Printer
“And what,” you might ask, “is a funky printer?” Well, you have a number 
of possibilities, but they all add up to a non-USB connection. (Remember, I 
said that USB connections to a printer are generally automatic, or at least 
handled by the printer’s installation software.) Some of the non-USB 
connections I mention in the previous section include Windows shared 
printers and IP printers.
No matter which type of funky printer you add, it needs a driver installed 
in the Printers folder, which resides inside your Library folder. (A driver is 
a software program provided by the printer manufacturer that tells Mac OS 
X how to communicate with your printer.) Also, if the printer is PostScript 
compatible, it needs a Postscript Printer Description (PPD) file installed in 
your PPD folder, which also appears in the Printers folder. Luckily, Snow 
Leopard comes complete with a long list of drivers and PPD files already 
installed and available — bravo, Apple dudes and dudettes!
To add a funky printer, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch the manufacturer’s installation application, which should copy 
the driver and PPD files for you.
 
 If you have to do things the hard way, manually copy the driver file into the 
Library/Printers folder and then copy the PPD file (if required) into 
the Library/Printers/PPD folder.
 
2. If you’re adding a physical printer — instead of an application printer 
driver — verify that the printer is turned on and accessible.
 
 If you’re printing to a shared printer connected to another Mac or PC, 
that computer has to be on. Luckily, most network printers (and their 
computer hosts) remain on all the time.
 
3. Display the Print & Fax pane within System Preferences and click the 
Add button (with the plus sign) on the Printing pane.
 
 You see the familiar Printer Browser. Shared printers using Bonjour 
network technology should show up on the default list, so you can click 
the printer to select it.
 
4. To add an IP printer, click the IP Printer button on the browser toolbar.
 
 Click the Protocol pop-up menu to choose the IP printing protocol 
(typically either IPP or the manufacturer-specific socket protocol). If you 
have a choice, it’s always a good idea to use the manufacturer-specific 
socket.

Managing Your Printing Jobs
 
 Click in the Address box and type the printer’s IP address or Domain 
Name System (DNS) name, which should be provided by your network 
administrator or the person running the print server. You can use the 
default queue on the server by leaving the Queue box blank — which I 
recommend — or select the Queue text box and type a valid queue name 
for the server.
 
 If you don’t know a valid queue name, you’re up a creek — hence, my 
recommendation to use the default queue.
 
 If you like, you can type a name and location for the remote printer; 
this is purely for identification purposes. Finally, click the Print Using 
pop-up menu, choose the brand and model of the remote printer, and 
then click Add.
 
5. To add a Windows printer, click the Windows button on the Printer 
Browser toolbar.
 
 Click the correct Windows workgroup that includes the printer(s) that 
you want to use in the left column. After a scan of the specified workgroup, 
Printer Browser displays the list of printers that it can access. (Don’t 
forget to thank His Billness later.)
 
6. After everything is tuned correctly, click the Print Using pop-up menu 
and choose the brand and model of the remote printer.
 
7. Click Add to complete the process and admire your new printer on 
the Print & Fax panel in System Preferences.
 
Heck, Snow Leopard even allows you to order supplies for your printer from 
the comfort of System Preferences! Sure, you’ll pay a premium price, but 
think of the techno-nerd bragging rights you’ll enjoy at your next Mac user 
group meeting! Click a printer in the Print & Fax panel and click the Options 
& Supplies button; then click the Supply Levels tab. When you click the 
Supplies button, System Preferences automatically launches Safari with the 
proper Web page from the Apple Store.
Managing Your Printing Jobs
You can also exercise some control over the documents — or, in technoid, 
print jobs — that you send to your printer. To display the jobs that are 
active (in line and preparing to print), open the Print & Fax pane in System 
Preferences and click the Open Print Queue button.
The actions that you can perform from the Print Queue window (as shown in 
Figure 4-2) are

Good question, and here’s the answer: Snow 
Leopard handles faxing so seamlessly that you 
don’t need a chapter’s worth of instruction! 
As long as your Mac has either an internal or 
external analog (dial-up) modem connected to 
a phone line, you’re a lean faxing machine.
To fax any open document within an active 
application, just choose File➪Print or press 
Ô+P. Click the PDF button at the bottom of 
the Print dialog and click Fax PDF. Either type 
a telephone number directly in the To field, or 
click the suave-looking button with the profile 
next to the field and choose a contact with a 
telephone number from your Address Book. 
(Make sure that you type your fax number into 
the My Fax Number field, just to stay legal.) 
Next, type a dialing prefix if one is necessary 
to reach an outside line. If you’re going to use 
your Mac as a fax machine often, I definitely 
recommend selecting the Show Fax Status 
in Menu Bar check box. That way, you can 
monitor what’s happening as your Mac sends 
and receives throughout the day.
If you need a spiffy-looking cover page, 
select the Use Cover Page check box. Click 
in the Message box directly below it and type 
whatever you like. You can optionally type 
a subject as well. When all is ready, throw 
caution utterly to the wind and click the Fax 
button. The Printer Browser treats a fax just as 
it does any other printed document, so you can 
cancel it or monitor its progress, as I discuss 
in the section, “Managing Your Printing Jobs.”
Your Mac can also receive faxes. To enable 
this feature, open System Preferences and 
click the Print & Fax icon. Click the entry for 
your fax in the list, click the Receive Options 
button, and then select the Receive Faxes on 
This Computer check box. Set the number 
of rings Snow Leopard should wait before 
answering the call. You can save your 
incoming faxes as files within a folder you 
specify or e-mail the contents automatically 
to any e-mail address you like. (Perfect for 
vacations!) If you like, you can even take the 
mundane route and print them on your system 
printer.

Sharing a Printer across That There Network
 
✦ Delete: When you click a print job in the list and then click the Delete 
icon, the print job is removed from the queue. You might need to delete 
a print job if you discover a mistake in the document while printing.
 
 If the job is currently printing, several additional pages might be printed 
before the job is finally canceled. In other words, information already 
sent to the printer might have to be printed before the cancel request 
can be processed.
 
✦ Hold: Click the Hold toolbar icon to pause printing of the current print 
job. The status of the print job changes to Hold.
 
✦ Resume: Click a print job in Hold status in the list and then click the 
Resume icon to resume printing.
 
✦ Job Info: Click this button to display basic information about the 
selected print job, such as number of pages and page size.
 
✦ Pause Printer: Click this icon to stop all printing to this printer. Note, 
however, that unlike using the Delete command, Pause Printer doesn’t 
remove any print jobs from the list. When jobs are stopped, the Pause 
Printer icon morphs into Resume Printer — click it to restart all jobs in 
the queue list.
 
 This is a good feature to use when your printer is about to run out of 
paper.
 
✦ Supply Levels: If your printer supports remote supply monitoring, you 
can click this icon to display the current levels of ink and paper in your 
printer. (Thus saving your feet from the wear and tear of walking.)
 
✦ Printer Setup: Click this icon and Snow Leopard displays the model-
specific configuration settings and features (if any) that are available 
for the selected printer. Of course, these settings vary for every printer 
produced by the hand of Man — they’re actually determined by the 
manufacturer’s printer driver — but they usually include actions (such 
as cleaning and alignment) and settings (such as print quality).
Sharing a Printer across That There Network
Before we leave the Island of Big X Printing, I’d like to show you how to 
share a printer with others on your local network, using Snow Leopard’s 
super-easy Bonjour network sharing feature. (Earlier in this chapter, I show 
you how to connect to other shared printers around you. Here, you’re going 
to share a printer that’s connected directly to your Mac.)
 
If you decide to share your printers, don’t be surprised if Mac OS X seems to 
slow down slightly from time to time. This is because of the processing time 
necessary for your Mac to store queued documents from other computers. 
The hard drive activity on your Mac is likely to significantly increase as well.

618
Sharing a Printer across That There Network
Once again, turn to System Preferences! Click the Sharing icon; then click 
the Printer Sharing check box to select it. (When it comes to printing, Snow

even without the bad pun.) To share a printer, click the check box next to 
the desired printer (as shown in Figure 4-3) and click the Add button to 
select which users will have access to the shared printer. (By default, a 
shared printer can be accessed by everyone.) Voilà! You’re the guru!

“Hey, what about my firewall?” Perhaps you would worry if you were using 
that Other Operating System — which shall remain nameless here — but 
you’re using Snow Leopard, and everything is set automatically for you the 
moment you click the Printer Sharing check box! Snow Leopard automatically 
opens the correct port in your firewall to allow printer sharing. (And yes, if 
you decide not to share your printers and you deselect the Printer Sharing 
check box later, Snow Leopard cleans up after you. It closes the port in your 
firewall for you.) Super-flippin’ sweet.
The printers that you specify are available to other computers within the 
same IP subnet. In other words, someone in your local network can use your 
printers, but no one outside your network has access.
 
If you haven’t already assigned a printer a descriptive name, click the desired 
printer from the list in the Print & Fax pane and then click the Options & 
Supplies button. Click the General button on the sheet that appears and 
enter a descriptive name in the Name text field. You can also identify that 
printer’s location in the Location text field. For example, in an office 
environment, I like to add the room number to a shared printer name (as 
well as the Location field).

n Chapter 1 of this minibook, I present you with an overview of the most 
popular hardware that you can add to your Mac — and where there’s 
hardware, software can’t be far behind. (Somebody famous said that — I 
think it was either Bill Gates or Dennis Miller. I consider both of them 
famous comedians.)
Anyway, Mac OS X comes with a full suite of software tools right out the 
box. You get Internet connectivity, disk repair, a digital audio and video 
player, basic image editing and cataloging, digital video editing, and — 
depending on the price that you paid or the Mac model that you bought — 
even games and a complete set of productivity applications. However, if 
you’re willing to pay for additional features and a manual (at least what 
passes for a manual in the manufacturer’s opinion), you can make all these 
tasks easier and accomplish them in even shorter time.
Read on for an overview of the most popular third-party software applications 
for Mac OS X: what everyone’s using, how much they cost, and why they’re 
(usually) better. Before you drop a wad of cash on a fancy new application, 
though, remember yet another of Mark’s Maxims:
 
If a program you already have does everything you really need — and 
you like the way it works — you don’t have to upgrade. Honest and truly.

The Trundling Microsoft Mammoth
The Trundling Microsoft Mammoth
Yes, I know I’ve been poking fun at His Gatesness for much of this book — 
you have to admit, he makes a pretty good target — but he did pull PC 
owners out of the character-based world of DOS, and I’ll be the first to say 
that he does get things right from time to time. (Witness my bestselling book 
PCs All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies [Wiley], recently revised for a 
fourth edition!)
For example, I’ve always been more impressed with Microsoft Office than 
I’ve been with Microsoft Windows. (At least Windows XP Professional and 
Windows Vista are steps in the right direction, but they still have a long way 
to go to match Mac OS X.) Office has long been the productivity suite of 
choice in the Windows world, and it’s also been a popular favorite in years 
past on the Macintosh side.
A lot of hard work was put into the latest version of Microsoft Office, and it 
shows. Office 2008 was designed specifically for Mac OS X, using the rules 
that Apple recommends for the Aqua user interface. As you can see in 
Figure 5-1, it looks much like a native Mac OS X application (such as Pages 
from iWork, which is Apple’s competing office productivity suite).
 
Figure 5-1: 
Man, that is

However, as with Mac OS X itself, Office 2008 isn’t just an attractive exterior. 
Consider some of the advantages of Office 2008:
 
✦ Perfect document compatibility with the Windows version of Office: 
You can both read and write documents with transparent ease, no 
matter which platform gets the file. Documents can be shared between 
platforms on the same network.
 
✦ Mirrored commands: Office 2007 and Mac Office 2008 have very similar 
menu items, dialogs, and settings, thus making Mac OS X instantly 
familiar to anyone who’s used Office on a Windows PC.
 
✦ Support for native Aqua features: This includes transparent graphics 
within your documents, input and confirmation sheets, and palettes for 
formatting.
 
✦ Tons of templates, samples, and support files: Microsoft doesn’t scrimp 
on ready-to-use documents and templates, as well as additional fonts, 
clip art, and Web samples.
 
✦ Entourage: Entourage is the Macintosh counterpart to Windows Outlook. 
It combines most of the same features that you’ll find in the Apple 
Mail, iCal, and Address Book applications. (Read about Apple Mail in 
Book V, Chapter 2; read about the Address Book in Book I, Chapter 6.) 
Use Entourage to participate in Internet newsgroups; it also includes a 
Mailing List Manager to help you keep track of the deluge of list messages 
that you receive every day.
If you’re already using iWork ’09, you might 
have noticed that the Office applications Excel, 
Word, and PowerPoint provide roughly the 
same features. Therefore, you might wonder 
whether you should scrap iWork.
Remember my maxim — if the iWork suite 
that you’re familiar with is doing the job, I 
recommend that you keep it. After all, iWork is a 
powerful productivity suite on its own, capable 
of producing results that are easily as good as 
or better than Office 2008. Also, Apple provides 
conversion filters that can allow you to open 
and save Office documents so that you’re not 
isolated from the Office crowd.
On the other side of the coin, I do recommend 
that you buy Office if
 ✓ You prefer the Office 2008 menu design and 
features.
 ✓ You’d like to keep most of the same 
commands replicated in the same places 
as the Windows version of Office.
 ✓ You want to seamlessly share documents 
with co-workers who use Windows Office 
on your network or through e-mail.
What about iWork?

622
Your Mac OS X Toolbox: TechTool Pro
Besides Entourage, Office 2008 on the Mac includes four applications:
 
✦ Word: The word processing application that rules the planet
 
✦ Excel: The leading spreadsheet application
 
✦ Messenger: Microsoft’s answer to iChat, an instant messaging program 
compatible with the Windows version of Messenger
 
✦ PowerPoint: A favorite presentation development application
The Mac Office 2008 suite costs about $200 at the time of this writing. 
You might save a few dollars if you buy it online from a Web store such as 
MacMall (www.macmall.com).
Your Mac OS X Toolbox: TechTool Pro
My favorite native Mac OS X disk repair application is TechTool Pro from 
Micromat (www.micromat.com).
 
More than just about any other type of application, it’s important for a disk 
maintenance program to be built “from the ground up” for Mac OS X. Never 
attempt to repair a Mac OS X disk using an older repair utility that wasn’t 
designed for Snow Leopard.
With TechTool Pro 5 (as shown in Figure 5-2), you can thoroughly check 
a hard drive for both physical errors (such as faulty electronics or a bad 
sector on the disk surface) and logical errors (incorrect folder data and 
glitches in the file structure). The Disk Utility that’s included with Mac OS 
X does a fine job of checking the latter, but it doesn’t perform the physical 
testing — and TechTool Pro does both.
 
I should note, however, that TechTool Pro doesn’t take care of viruses. Pick 
up a copy of VirusBarrier X5 (www.intego.com) to protect yourself against 
viral attack.
TechTool Pro also takes care of disk optimization, which is a feature that’s 
been conspicuously absent from Mac OS X ever since the beginning. As I 
explain in Book I, Chapter 7, defragmenting your disk will result in better 
performance and a faster system overall.
TechTool Pro 5, which will set you back about $80, comes on a self-booting 
DVD-ROM, so you can easily fix your startup volume by booting your system 
from the installation disc.

Image Editing for the Masses
The only one true King of the Retouching Hill in Mac OS X, Adobe Photoshop 
(www.adobe.com/products/photoshop) has been the digital-image 
editing favorite of Mac owners for many years now. As does Office 2008, the 
latest version of Photoshop (cs4) takes full advantage of the Aqua standard.
You can find more three-pound Photoshop books on the shelf than politicians 
in trouble, so it’s no surprise that I can’t provide you with a sweeping list 
of its features in this section. However, here’s a summary of what you can 
expect from Adobe’s crown jewel:
 
✦ Superior editing: The most sophisticated image editing possible for a 
digital photograph. If you can accomplish an image-editing task in 
software, it’s very likely that Photoshop can do it. You can even combine 
and splice parts of different images to produce a new work of art or 
perhaps distort and liquefy an image to produce a new look.
 
✦ Image retouching tools: These help you rescue images with problems, 
such as overexposure and color imbalance. (You can also use tools such 
as the Healing brush to erase imperfections in the photograph’s subject.)

624
The Morass of Digital Video
 
✦ Plug-ins: Photoshop has been a standard for plug-in functionality since 
it first appeared. If you need features that aren’t in the application out of 
the box, you can add them through third-party plug-ins.
 
✦ Web posting: Prepare images for use on the Web.
 
✦ Painting tools: Use these gems to simulate different types of inks, 
paints, and brushes on different types of media.
 
Although Photoshop is a hefty $699 for the full package, Adobe has also 
created a kid brother, Photoshop Elements, which sells for a mere $90. 
Designed for the novice or intermediate-level photographer, Elements 
has most of the functionality of the full package that you’re likely to need. 
Elements also provides a number of very helpful wizards to help automate 
the most common image-editing tasks, as well as one of the most compre-
hensive Help systems I’ve ever used.
The Morass of Digital Video
Two types of applications make up the DV market: digital video editing (in 
which you create a movie) and DVD mastering (in which you take that movie 
and create a DVD movie). You can find a number of great applications on 
the market in both these categories, all at different price points and different 
levels of complexity. They include
 
✦ iMovie: I cover this easy-to-use video editing iApp in Book III, Chapter 4. 
A good choice for any novice, it’s usually bundled for free with today’s 
new Mac models, and you get it as part of the iLife suite.
 
✦ iDVD: This is the DVD mastering counterpart to iMovie. Although it’s 
a snap to use, it doesn’t offer a lot of advanced features. (Book III, 
Chapter 5 explains iDVD in detail.) Again, you receive it free with 
your Mac.
 
✦ DVD Studio Pro: Apple’s entry into the ranks of DVD mastering can 
produce a commercial-quality DVD movie disc, but don’t expect any 
hand holding or assistants with this application. This is a serious tool 
for professionals, and as part of Apple’s Final Cut Studio 2, it’ll set you 
back $1,300. With DVD Studio Pro 4 (www.apple.com/finalcut
studio/dvdstudiopro), you can add interactive, animated menus, 
subtitles, multiple audio tracks, and Web interactivity to your DVD 
projects.
 
✦ Final Cut Pro 6: As another part of that uber $1,300 Final Cut Studio 2 
package, you’d assume Final Cut Pro (www.apple.com/finalcut
studio/finalcutpro) to be the best DV editing package on the 
market for Mac OS X . . . and you wouldn’t get any argument from me. It 
offers real-time playback with RT Extreme HD — no waiting for rendering — 
and high-definition support over a FireWire connection. Sassy.

Yes, It’s Really Called “Toast”
Yes, It’s Really Called “Toast”
Time to turn your attention to a subject near and dear to my heart: recording 
data CDs, audio CDs, and DVDs on the Macintosh. Of course, Mac OS X can 
burn basic data CDs that you can share with your Windows and UNIX friends 
without any add-on software. If you have a Mac equipped with a SuperDrive, 
you can create standard, cross-platform data DVDs, too. But what if you 
need an exotic format, such as CD Extra, that allows data and digital audio 
tracks to co-exist peacefully on one disc? Or perhaps you need a self-booting 
disc, or you just got a Blu-ray external recorder?
There’s one clear choice: When you’re ready to seriously burn, you’re ready 
for Roxio Toast Titanium (www.roxio.com), the CD and DVD recording 
choice for millions of Mac owners. (No snickering about the name, please.) 
Figure 5-3 illustrates this powerhouse of an application, which is an elegant 
design that’s both simple to use and perfectly Aqua. Files, folders, and digital 
audio tracks that you want to record are simply dropped into the application 
window.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Toast is the 
classic Mac 
CD and DVD 
recording 
application.
 
As for exotic formats, here’s a list of what types of discs you can record with 
Toast:

626
If You Positively Have to Run Windows . . .
 
✦ Standard data CDs and DVDs
 
✦ Standard audio CDs
 
✦ Video CDs
 
✦ MP3 discs (which store MP3 audio tracks)
 
✦ Discs recorded from an image file
 
✦ Mac volumes
 
✦ Hybrid PC/Mac discs
 
✦ ISO 9660 discs
 
✦ Multisession discs
 
✦ CD Extra discs
Toast works with both internal and external CD, DVD, and Blu-ray recorders, 
taking advantage of the latest features on today’s drives. You can also copy 
existing discs, using one or multiple drives.
Toast is quite affordable at $80. You can buy it directly from the Roxio online 
store at www.roxio.com.
If You Positively Have to Run Windows . . .
Here’s where Mac power users usually start grinning from ear to ear like 
Santa’s elves on the day after Christmas, because — get this — many of 
the great Unwashed Windows Horde still actually think that you can’t run 
Windows on a Macintosh! Can you believe that? Obviously, they haven’t 
heard of Boot Camp, which is built into Snow Leopard . . . but what if you 
don’t want to reboot to switch operating systems? What if you need to share 
data between both Mac and PC applications running simultaneously? Well, 
that’s where Parallels Desktop from Parallels (www.parallels.com) comes 
in, which without a doubt is one of the coolest applications ever written for 
the Mac.
No, my friend, your eyes aren’t deceiving you — you’re indeed looking at 
Windows 2000 running on my MacBook in Figure 5-4. Parallels Desktop 
(which requires Mac OS X) provides a near-perfect PC environment for any 
version of Windows from 95 all the way up to Vista; literally, Windows has no 
idea that it’s not running on a typical piece of PC iron.
Parallels Desktop simulates everything necessary for you to get the full 
functionality out of Windows. For example, this jewel automatically (and 
transparently) handles your Windows Internet connection, network tasks, 
and CD and DVD access. Heck, it even allows you to use your single-button 
mouse as a two-button PC mouse (by holding down the Control key while 
you click). You can run full-screen or run Windows in a window. (Pun joy-
fully intended.)

Figure 5-4: 
Take that, 
Bill! I get

As if that weren’t enough, you can also run multiple operating systems. So if 
you need Linux or Windows 2000 along with your Vista system, no problem — 
all it takes is the install disc for those operating systems and the hard drive 
space to hold ’em. Outstanding!
Naturally, performance is an issue — and, to be honest, Parallels Desktop 
isn’t for the PC gamer, even with the newest Macs and their super-duper 
GeForce and Radeon video cards. Because today’s PC games push an actual 
PC to the limit, they just run too sluggishly on a Mac emulating a PC — they 
do run, just slowly. (Also, virtually all of today’s blockbuster PC games are 
also being ported to Mac OS X, so why not just run the Mac version?)
However, when it comes to just about any other type of application, Parallels 
Desktop running on a late-model Intel-based Mac can deliver performance 
equal to a typical Pentium 4 PC. The more memory that your Mac has, the 
more you can give your virtual PC, so it also pays to have 2GB or more of 
RAM. (And naturally, a multiprocessor Mac runs Parallels Desktop much 
faster.) I use this application with niche Windows programs that have never 
appeared on the Mac as well as native Mac versions of all other applications. 
Again, you don’t need to use Mac to run the Windows version of Photoshop 
CS4 because Photoshop CS4 is also available for the Mac.

All Hail FileMaker Pro
If you’re tired of the undeserved taunts from your clueless Windows 
friends — you know, the ones who say that you can’t run both Mac and 
Windows programs at the same time — head to your browser and order a 
copy of Parallels Desktop. The program is a very affordable $80 — but don’t 
forget: You have to supply your own copy of Windows.
All Hail FileMaker Pro
If databases are the name of your game, you’ve already been using FileMaker 
Pro for years (on both Mac and Windows, more than likely). For the uninitiated, 
FileMaker Pro (www.filemakerpro.com) is the premier database creation, 
editing, and maintenance application for Mac OS X. It comes with dozens of 
ready-made database templates for business, home, and education use, or 
you can construct your own database in surprisingly short order.
Right out of the box, FileMaker Pro can create
 
✦ Business databases and forms for inventory, personnel, purchase 
orders, and product catalogs
 
✦ Home databases for budgeting, recipes, music CDs, DVD movies, family 
medical records, and event planning
 
✦ Education databases for student records, expense reports, field trip 
planning, book and multimedia libraries, and class scheduling
FileMaker Pro 10 can add images and multimedia to your database, and you 
can quickly and easily publish your databases on your Web site by using one 
of the built-in theme designs. (In fact, visitors to your Web site can update 
your database online, if you like.) FileMaker Pro can also allow multiple 
users to share data across your network, no matter whether they’re 
running the Mac or Windows version. The latest version even runs scripts 
automatically based on user input.
At $299, FileMaker Pro 10 is one of the least expensive — and most powerful — 
applications that you can buy for the Big X.

StuffIt
In the Windows world, the Zip archive is the king of archiving formats. An 
archive contains one or more compressed files that you can uncompress 
whenever you need them. Folks store files in archives to save space on their 
hard drives; archiving is also a neat way to package an entire folder’s worth 
of files in a single convenient file, which you can attach to an e-mail message 
or send via File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Mac OS X includes built-in support 
for zip files.
On Planet Macintosh, the archiving format of choice is StuffIt. Manage 
your archives with StuffIt Deluxe 2009, from Smith Micro Software 
(mysmithmicro.com). StuffIt Deluxe 2009 can both archive and unarchive 
.sit files (the common name for StuffIt archives) as well as Zip archives 
from your Windows friends. You can also encrypt the contents of a StuffIt 
archive for those “sensitive” transfers. The application runs $80 at the Smith 
Micro Software online Web store.
QuicKeys X3
QuicKeys X3, from Startly Technologies (www.startly.com), is another 
example of someone’s thinking properly. This time, the idea is to automate 
repetitive tasks by allowing Mac OS X to memorize what you do. Think 
of QuicKeys X3 as a system-wide, macro playback application. Unlike 
AppleScript, however, QuicKeys X3 works within any application and 
can play back mouse movement and clicks/double-clicks. (And unlike 
Automator, you can perform any action that you could normally perform 
within an application by typing.)
I’ve used QuicKeys X3 for a number of different tasks, including
 
✦ Typing a commonly used block of text (such as my address) into 
applications that don’t support macros
 
✦ Launching applications at specific times and dates
 
✦ Operating menus within programs to automate complex tasks
 
✦ Launching Classic or choosing a specific startup disk with a single key 
sequence
QuicKeys X3 sells for $80 on the Startly Technologies Web site.

Utilities That Rock
BBEdit
Although we all know and love Mac OS X as a graphical operating system, 
folks still need a powerful text editor for creating and modifying text files. 
For example, software developers and Webmasters still use text editors daily 
to write applications or apply a quick fix to the HyperText Markup Language 
(HTML) that makes up a Web page. (I use a text editor to make minor 
changes to my Web site, MLC Books Online, without firing up a horrendous 
Web design application. Talk about overkill!)
At first, you might think of TextEdit, which is the free application that ships 
with Mac OS X. It’s not a bad editor, either, with features that are very similar 
to Notepad in the Windows environment. However, serious text and code 
editing requires a more powerful tool, and the text editor of choice for Mac 
owners is universally considered to be BBEdit, from Bare Bones Software 
(www.barebones.com). Figure 5-5 shows a document open within BBEdit 9.
 
Figure 5-5: 
For editing 
text, you’ll

Bare Bones Software pulls no punches in describing BBEdit — its advertising 
still proclaims, “It doesn’t suck.” Gotta give Bare Bones credit; this incredibly 
popular editor includes features such as
 
✦ Support for DOS/Windows, Mac, and UNIX text files: Yes, differences 
do exist among the platforms, even with a so-called pure text file.
 
✦ Works with text files over 2GB in size: Try that with TextEdit. Hmm . . . 
on second thought, please don’t.

✦ Syntax coloring: Use this to help you quickly locate commands and 
qualifiers in programming languages.
 
✦ Built-in FTP transfer commands: No need to launch a separate FTP 
application: You can send your files right from within BBEdit.
You can even expand the functionality of BBEdit with plug-ins, many of 
which are free extensions written by programmers and developers specifically 
for languages such as C/C++, Java/JavaScript, Perl, and Pascal.
BBEdit 9 is available from the Bare Bones Software site for $125.
REALbasic
The final application that I want to mention really isn’t a utility as such; 
however, you can use it to write your own software, so I guess that it should 
qualify. As an ex-COBOL programmer, reluctant Visual Basic shareware 
developer, and recalcitrant dBASE coder, I can tell you that REALbasic (from 
REAL Software) is definitely the easiest visual drag-and-drop programming 
environment that I’ve ever used on a personal computer. If you want to 
develop your own productivity applications, Mac OS X utilities, or — dare I 
say it? your own game! — award-winning REALbasic 2009 is the way to go.
Development in REALbasic is as simple as designing the application window 
by first simply adding controls, text, and multimedia wherever you like. 
Then just fill in the blanks, such as by setting variables and specifying what 
happens when the controls are triggered, which you do by using a new 
implementation of the tried-and-true BASIC language. Of course, some 
programming knowledge is required, but far less than you’d need with Visual 
Basic. And the results look as good as anything you can accomplish in those 
so-called real programming languages.
Check out these features:
 
✦ Cross-platform support so that you can write your program once and 
compile it for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Code it once; then 
release three versions with no extra work. This is a very superb thing.
 
✦ Support for all sorts of multimedia, including QuickTime.
 
✦ Ability to animate and rotate text and objects, or tap the 3-D power of 
QuickDraw3D and OpenGL graphics.

632
At Least One Game
 
✦ Capability to allow printing, network, and Internet communications 
within your application.
 
✦ Automation of Microsoft Office applications and connection of your 
REALbasic application to business databases (such as FileMaker Pro).
 
✦ Completely royalty-free applications, so you can give them away or 
release them as shareware.
REALbasic has been such a popular development tool on the Macintosh 
for so many years that dozens of user-supported Web sites and mailing 
lists have sprung up, offering all sorts of REALbasic plug-ins, tutorials, and 
sample code for you to use in your own projects.
REALbasic 2009 comes in two versions: the Personal Edition ($99) and the 
Professional Edition ($500). You can order either version from the REAL 
Software site at www.realsoftware.com.
At Least One Game
To be completely accurate, Mac OS X already comes with at least one 
game — a very good version of chess, which I cover in the next section — 
but the Macintosh has never been considered a true gaming platform by 
most computer owners. Until recently, many popular Windows games were 
never ported (or converted) for the Mac, and only the most expensive Mac 
models had the one important component that determines the quality of 
today’s games: a first-rate, 3-D video card.
However, within the last two years or so, all that has changed dramatically. 
All of today’s Mac models feature muscle-car-quality video cards that use 
the NVIDIA GeForce or ATI Radeon chipsets; they can handle the most 
complex 3-D graphics with ease. Match that with the renewed popularity of 
the Macintosh as a home computer and the performance of the current crop 
of Intel-based processors, and — wham! Suddenly you’ve got the best game 
developers in the business — id Software (www.idsoftware.com) and 
Blizzard (www.blizzard.com), to name two — releasing Macintosh versions 
of their newest games concurrently with the Windows version.
For the gamer in you, allow me to take you on a tour of the best of the new 
generation of entertainment.
Mac OS X Chess
No mercenaries, no rail guns, and no cities to raze — but chess is still the 
world’s most popular game, and Mac OS X even includes a little 3-D as well.

The game features speech recognition, move hints, take back (or undo) for

form and print them or save games in progress. Maybe it’s not a complete 
set of bells and whistles as commercial chess games offer, but the price is 
right, and the play can be quite challenging when you set it at the higher skill 
levels.
World of WarCraft
I end this chapter with Blizzard’s best: the online megahit that is World of 
WarCraft. This MMORPG (short for massive multiplayer online role-playing 
game) is yet another wrinkle in the popular WarCraft game series. World of 
WarCraft puts the character you create in the boots of human princes, Orc 
battle generals, undead champions, trolls, gnomes, and elfin lords — in 
fact, you can create multiple characters and play them as you choose. My 
recommendation: Stick with the Undead, my friend.
Combat, however, is only half the job. By finishing quests and killing various 
nasties, you earn experience, upgrade your armor and weapons, and build 
reputation with various groups throughout the land. You can take to the air, 
buy goods from mercenaries, and even discover a trade like leatherworking 
or enchanting. Spells abound, and you can join a guild and chat with the new 
friends you make online. . . . I’ve played for over two years now, and I’m still 
excited by this incredible game.

At Least One Game
Control is by both keyboard and mouse; the game is easy to understand, 
but you’ll always find someone to kick your posterior in battlegrounds or 
dungeons over the Internet.
You’ll pay about $50 online for World of WarCraft and then you’ll be charged 
a set fee for each month’s subscription . . . and it’ll be worth every single 
penny you spend. (Remember, this is a program you’d buy on your own; 
it doesn’t come with your Mac or with Snow Leopard.) For all the details and

Chapter 1: . . . And UNIX 
Lurks Beneath
In This Chapter
✓ Why use UNIX?
✓ Doing things with the keyboard
✓ Introducing UNIX commands
✓ Creating text files
✓ Exploring deep inside Mac OS X
A
s I mention in the first chapter of the book — at the beginning of our 
Snow Leopard odyssey — UNIX lurks deep beneath the shiny Aqua 
exterior of Mac OS X. UNIX is a tried-and-true operating system that’s been 
around for decades, since the days when mainframe computers were king. 
If you don’t believe that it’s a powerful (and popular) operating system, 
consider that over half of all Web servers on the Internet use some variety 
of UNIX as their operating system of choice.
Besides being battle-tested and having a long history, UNIX offers some 
fantastic features. Unlike the graphical world of Mac OS X, the keyboard 
plays an integral role while you’re using a UNIX-based operating system. 
Because UNIX is text-based, you’ll find that it’s evolved a large set of useful 
keyboard-driven commands that can perform powerful feats that a mouse 
user just can’t easily equal. This chapter examines the role of the keyboard 
in UNIX operating systems and describes how to execute standard file 
system commands. You also discover how to use Apple’s additional set of 
commands and install your own commands (and simple programs) from the 
Internet.
Why Use the Keyboard?
To begin benefiting from the UNIX underpinnings of Mac OS X, get used to 
doing things with the keyboard. Although mouse skills can be applied to 
UNIX, you’ll generally find performing UNIX functions faster and easier with 
the keyboard.

638
Why Use the Keyboard?
UNIX keyboarding is fast
Why on Earth would any red-blooded Macintosh owner want to leave the 
comfort of the mouse to use a keyboard? After all, the graphical user interface 
is what made the Macintosh great in the first place. With the Finder, you can 
navigate and manage the various files on your hard drive with a few clicks. 
This sounds simple enough, but for some tasks, using the keyboard can be 
just as fast, if not faster.
Suppose, for example, that you need to copy a file from somewhere on your 
hard drive to somewhere else on that same drive. To do so with the Finder, 
you must first open a Finder window (by clicking the Finder icon in the 
Dock or by double-clicking a drive icon on your Desktop). Then, by using a 
succession of mouse clicks, you navigate to where the file that you wish to 
copy resides. Next, you might open another Finder window and navigate to 
the folder where you wish to copy the file. (Note that opening the second 
Finder window requires pressing Ô+N; clicking the Finder icon in the Dock 
doesn’t open a second Finder window.) Finally, you duplicate the original file 
and drag that copy to its intended destination.
Comparatively, by using the keyboard and the power of UNIX, you can 
accomplish the same task with a one-line command. For some tasks, the 
mouse is definitely the way to go, but you can perform some other tasks 
just as quickly, if not faster, with the keyboard. For the skinny on one-line 
commands, skip down to the upcoming section “Uncovering the Terminal.”
The UNIX keyboard is a powerful beast
So maybe you’re not an expert typist, and using the mouse still sounds 
inviting. For many scenarios, you’d be correct in assuming that a mouse can 
handle the job just as quickly and easily as a bunch of commands that you 
have to memorize. Using the keyboard, however, offers some other distinct 
advantages over the mouse. To allow you to control your computer from the 
keyboard, all UNIX operating systems offer the command-line tool. With this 
tool, you can enter commands one line at a time: hence, its name. Mac OS X 
ships with the command-line application, Terminal. You can find it here:
/Applications/Utilities/Terminal
One shining feature of the command line is its efficiency. To wit: When you 
use a mouse, one mouse click is equal to one command. When you use the 
command line, on the other hand, you aren’t limited to entering one command 
at a time; rather, you can combine commands into a kind of super-command 
(minus the silly cape, but with bulging muscles intact), with each command 
performing some action of the combined whole. By using the command line, 
you can string together a whole bunch of commands to do a very complex 
task.

Book VIII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX 
Lurks Beneath
639
Why Use the Keyboard?
For example, consider how many times you’d have to click a mouse in the 
Finder to do the following:
 
1. Find all files that begin with the letters MyDocument.
 
2. From this list of files, add a number to the beginning of the filename, 
indicating its size in kilobytes.
 
3. Save the names of all altered files to a text file.
By using the command line, you could accomplish all these tasks by typing 
only one super-command: that is, a collection of three simple commands 
combined to form one instruction. The built-in Terminal program that ships 
with Mac OS X Snow Leopard gives you everything that you need to start 
using the command line. I show you how in the section “Uncovering the 
Terminal,” later in this chapter.
 
Delving further into super-commands isn’t for the faint-hearted; things get 
pretty ugly pretty quickly, and this chapter can only show you the very 
beginning of the UNIX Yellow Brick Road. Therefore, if your thirst for UNIX 
dominance so compels you, I invite you to do a little independent study 
to bone up on the operating system. Pick up a copy of the great book of 
lore entitled UNIX For Dummies, 5th Edition, written by John R. Levine and 
Margaret Levine Young (Wiley).
Go where no mouse has gone before
The Finder is generally a helpful thing, but it makes many assumptions about 
how you work. One of these assumptions is that you don’t have any need to 
handle some of the files on your hard drive. As I mention in Book II, Chapter 
6, Mac OS X ships with its system files marked Off Limits, and I generally 
agree with that policy (which keeps anyone from screwing up the delicate 
innards of Mac OS X). To secure your system files, Apple purposely hides 
some files from view.
But what road do you take if you actually need to view or modify those 
system files? Yep, you guessed it: The command line comes to the rescue! 
You can use the command line to peer inside every nook and cranny of your 
Mac’s vast directory structure on your hard drive. It also has the power to 
edit files that aren’t normally accessible to you. With the command line, you 
can pretend to be other users — even users with more permissions. By 
temporarily acting as another more powerful user, you can perform actions 
with the command line that would be impossible in the Finder. (Just remember 
to make sure that you know exactly what you’re doing, or you’re working 
with an Apple technical support person — a wrong move, and it’ll be time 
for an Ominous Chord.)

Why Use the Keyboard?
Automate to elevate
If all these benefits are beginning to excite you, hold on to your socks! Not 
only can you perform complex commands with the command line, you can 
go even one step further: automation. If you find yourself using the same 
set of commands more than once, you’re a likely candidate for using 
automation to save time. Instead of typing the list of commands each 
time, you can save them to a text file and execute the entire file with only 
one command. Now that’s power, right up there with the dynamic duo of 
AppleScript and Automator!
Of course, you probably don’t like doing housekeeping tasks while you’re 
busy on other things, so schedule that list of commands to run in the middle 
of the night while you’re fast asleep. The command line lets you do that, too.
 
Note that automation of UNIX commands is totally separate from automation 
of Mac OS X applications with AppleScript and Automator, which I cover in 
Book VIII, Chapter 2.
Remote control
“So, Mark, the command line is the cat’s meow for efficiently accessing and 
working with files on my Mac, and I can use it to automate many operations. 
Anything else?” I’m glad you asked! By using the command line, you can also 
send commands to another computer anywhere in the world (as long as you 
know the right login and password). After you log into another computer, 
you can use the same commands for the remote computer.
UNIX was created with multiple users in mind. Because computers used to 
be expensive (and honking huge machines to boot), UNIX was designed so 
that multiple users could remotely use the same machine simultaneously. In 
fact, if Mac OS X is your first encounter with UNIX, you might be surprised to 
know that many UNIX beginners of the past weren’t even in the same room, 
building, state, or even country as the computer that they were using.
Not only can you work with a computer that’s in a different physical location, 
but it’s also very fast to do so. Instead of the bandwidth hog that is the 
Internet, the command line is lean and mean. This permits you to use a 
remote computer nearly as fast as if it were sitting on the desk in front of 
you. (This is a great advantage for road warriors who need to tweak a Web 
or an e-mail server from a continent away.)

Uncovering the Terminal
Uncovering the Terminal
The best way to find out how to use command line is to jump right in. Mac 
OS X comes stocked with an application named Terminal. The Terminal 
application is where you enter commands in the command line. It’s located 
in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder on your hard drive — 
choose Applications➪Utilities.
Double-click the icon, as shown in Figure 1-1, to launch Terminal.
 
Figure 1-1: 
Find the 
Terminal 
application 
in your 
Utilities 
folder.
 
 
By the way, feel free to make Terminal more accessible by dragging its icon 
to the Dock or the toolbar. That way, you won’t have to dive this deep into 
the Applications folder in the future.
What’s a prompt?
Upon launch of the Terminal application, you’ll immediately notice some 
text in the window that appears on-screen:
Last login: Sun Jun 23 17:51:14 on console
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$

642
Uncovering the Terminal
As you might guess, this text details the last time that you logged into the 
Terminal. The last line, however, is the more important one. It’s called the 
prompt.
The prompt serves some important functions. First, it lists the current 
directory, which is listed as ~. A tilde character (~) denotes a user’s 
Home directory. By default, you’re always in your Home folder each time 
you begin a new session on the Terminal. After the current directory, the 
Terminal displays the name of the current user, which is markchambers in 
this example.
The final character of the prompt is a $. Consider this your cue because 
immediately after this character is where you enter any command that you 
wish to execute. Go ahead; don’t be shy. Try out your first command by 
typing uptime in the Terminal application. (It’s a good idea to type UNIX 
commands in lowercase.) Your text appears at the location of the cursor, 
denoted by a small square. If you make a mistake while entering the command, 
press the Delete key to back up and then type the characters again. (If the 
typing error is stuck deep in a longer command, press the left- or right-arrow 
key to move the cursor immediately after the incorrect character and press 
Delete to back up; then type the correct characters.) After you type the 
command, press Return to execute it.
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$ uptime
6:24PM  up  2:42, 4 users, load averages: 2.44, 2.38, 1.90
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$
If all goes well, you should see a listing of how long your Mac has been run-
ning since the last reboot or login. In the example listing, the computer 
has been running for 2 hours and 42 minutes (2:42 in line 2). Simple, eh? 
Immediately following the listing of the uptime command, the Terminal 
displays another prompt for you to enter more commands. I examine many 
more commands later in this chapter.
 
Prefer a different appearance for the Terminal window? Click the Terminal 
menu and choose Preferences; then click the Settings toolbar button to 
choose the color combinations for the Terminal window background and 
text.
A few commands to get started
Using the command line is simply a matter of entering simple instructions — 
or commands — into the Terminal application and pressing Return to 
execute them. It’s easy to use the command line to navigate through the 
various folders on your hard drive. You’ll become accustomed to using two 
vital commands: ls and cd. The ls command is shorthand for list, and it 
does just that: It lists the contents of the current directory. Enter ls at your 
prompt, and you should see a listing of your Home folder.

Book VIII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX 
Lurks Beneath
643
Uncovering the Terminal
The complementary cd command (lowercase) — which incidentally stands 
for change directory — opens any folder that you specify. It works much the 
same as double-clicking a folder in the Finder: The difference is that following 
the cd command, you don’t immediately see all the folder’s content. 
However, the cd command requires a parameter (extra options or information 
that appear after the command) so that your Mac knows which folder to open.
For example, to open the Documents folder that resides in your Home 
directory, type cd Documents and press Return. When you do, you might 
be surprised to see another prompt displayed immediately. So where are all 
the files in the Documents folder? You must enter another command to see 
what items are in the folder that you just opened. Type ls again to see the 
contents of the Documents folder.
 
If you try to open a folder that has a space in its name, make sure to enclose 
the folder’s name in quotation marks, like this:
cd “My Picture Folder”
Read more about using quotation marks in your commands in the upcoming 
section “Command-line gotchas.”
To return to your Home folder in this example, enter a modified version of 
the cd command:
cd ..
This causes your Mac to move back up the folder hierarchy one folder to 
your Home directory. By using these three simple commands — ls, cd 
foldername, and cd .. — you can traverse your entire hard drive.
 
After you successfully enter a command, you can recall it by pressing the 
up-arrow key. Press the up-arrow key again to see the command prior to 
that, and so forth. This is an extremely useful trick for retyping extra long file 
paths.
Using the skills you already have
Just because the Terminal is text based doesn’t mean that it doesn’t act 
like a good Macintosh citizen. All the usual Mac features that you know and 
love are there for you to use. Copy and Paste functions work as you might 
expect — but only at the prompt position.
Drag-and-drop is also at your disposal. After you play around with the 
Terminal for a while, you’ll find yourself bored to tears typing the long 
paths that represent the files on your hard drive. To automatically enter the 
path of a file or folder to a command, simply drag it to the active Terminal 
window, as shown in Figure 1-2. The file’s full path instantly appears at the 
location of your cursor. (Thanks, Apple!)

You can even use the mouse while entering commands in the Terminal. Click 
and drag your mouse over text to select it. From there, you can copy to the 
Clipboard as you might expect with any other application.
UNIX Commands 101
To use the command line effectively, familiarize yourself with the commands 
that are available to you. After all, how can you use a tool without knowing 
what it can do? Despite having to memorize a few commands, UNIX usually 
makes it easy on you by abbreviating commands, by following a standard 
grammar (so to speak), and by providing you with extensive documentation 
for each command.
Anatomy of a UNIX command
UNIX commands can perform many amazing feats. Despite their vast 
abilities, all commands follow a similar structure:
command <optional flag(s)> <optional operand(s)>
The simplest form of a UNIX command is the command itself. (For a basic 
discussion on UNIX commands such as ls, see the earlier section, “A few 
commands to get started.”) You can expand your use of the ls command by 
appending various flags, which are settings that enable or disable optional 
features for the command. Most flags are preceded by a dash (-) and always 
follow the command. For instance, you can display the contents of a directory 
as a column of names by tacking on a -l flag to the ls command.
ls –l

Book VIII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX 
Lurks Beneath
645
UNIX Commands 101
Besides flags, UNIX commands sometimes also have operands. An operand 
is something that is acted upon. For example, instead of just entering the ls 
command, which lists the current directory, you can add an operand to list a 
specific directory:
ls ~/Documents/myProject/
 
The tilde (~) denotes the user’s Home directory.
Sometimes a command can take multiple operands, as is the case when 
you copy a file. The two operands represent the source file and the 
destination of the file that you want to copy, separated by a space. The 
following example copies a text file from the Documents folder to the 
Desktop folder by using the cp command (short for copy).
cp ~/Documents/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyDocument
You can also combine flags and operands in the same command. This 
example displays the contents of a specific folder in list format:
ls –l ~/Documents/myProject/
Command-line gotchas
In earlier sections, I describe a few simple command-line functions. All these 
commands have something in common: You might not have noticed, but 
every example thus far involved folder names and filenames that contained 
only alphanumeric characters. Remember what happens if you have a folder 
name that has a space in it? Try the following example, but don’t worry 
when it doesn’t work.
 
The cd command stands for change directory.
cd /Desktop Folder
The result is an error message:
-bash: cd: /Desktop: No such file or directory
The problem is that a space character isn’t allowed in a path. To get around 
this problem, simply enclose the path in double quotation marks, like this:
cd “/Desktop Folder”
 
Mac OS X lets you use either double or single quotation marks to enclose a 
path with spaces in it. Standard UNIX operating systems, however, use 
double quotation marks for this purpose.

646
UNIX Commands 101
In a similar vein, you can get the space character to be accepted by a 
command by adding an escape character. To escape a character, add a 
backslash (\) immediately prior to the character in question. To illustrate, 
try the last command with an escape character instead. Note that this time, 
no quotation marks are necessary.
cd /Desktop\ Folder
 
You can use either quotation marks or escape characters because they’re 
interchangeable.
Help is on the way!
By now, you might be wondering how a computer techno-wizard is supposed 
to keep all these commands straight. Fortunately, you can find generous 
documentation for nearly every command available to you. To access this 
built-in help, use the man command. Using the man command (shorthand for 
manual) will display a help file for any command that it knows about. For 
example, to read the available help information for the ls command, simply 
type man ls at the prompt. Figure 1-3 illustrates the result.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Use the 
man 
command to 
display help 
information.
 
Autocompletion
To speed things along, the bash shell can automagically complete your 
input for you while you type. Although the Terminal permits you to enter 
commands via the keyboard, it is the shell that interprets those commands. 
Many kinds of shells are available to UNIX users. The shell that Snow 

Book VIII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX 
Lurks Beneath
647
Working with Files
Leopard uses by default is bash — another common shell is tcsh. Use the 
autocompletion features of bash to autocomplete both commands and file-
names. To demonstrate, begin by typing the following:
cd ~/De
Then press the Tab key. The result is that the shell predicts that you will 
want to type
cd ~/Desktop/
Of course, if you have another folder that begins with the letters De in the 
same folder, you might need to type a few additional characters. This gives 
the autocompletion feature more information to help it decide which 
characters you want to type. In other words, if you don’t type enough 
characters, autocompletion ends up like a detective without enough clues 
to figure things out.
Working with Files
If you’ve used a computer for any time at all, you’re no doubt familiar with 
the idea of files. Even before the first floppy drive appeared in personal 
computers, operating systems have stored data in files . . . they date back to 
the days when a mainframe computer occupied an entire floor of an office 
building. Mac OS X is no exception, and it’s important to understand how 
Mac OS X arranges them into folders and how you go about accessing them 
via the command line. This section describes the basic file and folder 
information that you need to know to tame the beast that is UNIX.
Paths
Before you dive into UNIX commands, you should first know a few facts . . . 
nasty things, facts, but you can’t earn your pair of techno-wizard suspenders 
without ’em. For starters, as a Mac user, you might not be familiar with how 
paths work in UNIX. A path is simply a textual representation of a folder or 
file. The simplest path is your Home directory, which is denoted by a tilde 
character (~) — the tilde character acts as the equivalent of /Users/<your 
short account name> (in my case, /Users/markchambers). Any folder 
within the Home directory is represented by the folder’s name preceded by 
a forward slash (/). For example, a document entitled myDoc that resides in 
the current user’s Documents folder would have a path like this:
~/Documents/myDoc

648
Working with Files
Similarly, a folder named myFolder that resides in the current user’s 
Documents folder would have a path like this:
~/Documents/myFolder/
 
As you’ve probably surmised, a folder and a directory are two different 
names for the same thing. Folder is the name with which most Mac users are 
familiar, and directory is a term that UNIX power users prefer. I use the terms 
interchangeably throughout the remainder of the chapter.
Because Mac OS X is a multiuser environment, you might sometimes want 
to work with folders or files somewhere other than in your Home folder. 
Starting from your Home folder, enter the following command:
cd ..
This moves you to the folder right above your Home folder, which happens 
to be the Users folder. Using another quick ls command will show you all 
users who are permitted to use the machine. (By the way, Shared isn’t a 
user — it’s a folder with privileges set so that any user can access its 
contents.)
Enter cd .. once again, and you find yourself at the root of your main hard 
drive. The root directory is what you see in the Finder when you double-click 
your hard drive icon on the Desktop. A user’s Home directory is represented 
by a tilde character (~), and the root of the hard drive is denoted by a forward 
slash (/), as displayed by the prompt:
WHITEDRAGON:/ markchambers$
It’s easy to return to your Home directory by following this sequence:
WHITEDRAGON:/ markchambers$ cd Users
WHITEDRAGON:/Users markchambers$ cd markchambers
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$
Here’s a faster way. Instead of moving through each successive folder until 
you reach your intended destination, you can specify the path by using just 
one cd command:
WHITEDRAGON:/ markchambers$ cd /Users/markchambers
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$
 
Of course, the Home directory is a special folder in that you can also 
navigate there by simply entering cd ~, but the main point here is that 
you can navigate directly to specific folders by using that folder’s path in 
conjunction with the cd command.

Book VIII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX 
Lurks Beneath
649
Working with Files
Furthermore, when you navigate your hard drive by using paths, you can 
jump directly to your desired destination from any place. When you enter 
cd .., it is in relation to your current position, whereas entering
cd /Users/markchambers
will always take you to the same directory, regardless of your starting point.
Copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files
After you’re comfortable with moving around the hierarchy of your hard 
drive, it’s a cinch to copy, move, and rename files and folders.
To copy files from the command line, use the cp command. Because using 
the cp command will copy a file from one place to another, it requires two 
operands: first the source and then the destination. For instance, to copy a 
file from your Home folder to your Documents folder, use the cp command 
like this:
cp ~/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyDocument
 
Keep in mind that when you copy files, you must have proper permissions 
to do so! Here’s what happens when I try to copy a file from my Desktop to 
another user’s Desktop (strangely named fuadramses):
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$ cp ~/Desktop/MyDocument/Users/fuadramses/Desktop/
MyDocument
Denied! Thwarted! Refused!
cp: /Users/fuadramses/Desktop/MyDocument: Permission denied
If you can’t copy to the destination that you desire, you need to precede the 
cp command with sudo. Using the sudo command allows you to perform 
functions as another user. The idea here is that the other user whom you’re 
“emulating” has the necessary privileges to execute the desired copy 
operation. When you execute the command, the command line asks you for 
a password. If you don’t know what the password is, you probably shouldn’t 
be using sudo. Your computer’s administrator should have given you an 
appropriate password to use. After you enter the correct password, the 
command executes as desired.
 
In case you’re curious, sudo stands for set user and do. It sets the user to the 
one that you specify and performs the command that follows the username.
sudo cp ~/Desktop/MyDocument /Users/fuadramses/Desktop/MyDocument
Password:

650
Working with Files
A close cousin to the cp (copy) command is the mv (move) command. As 
you can probably guess, the mv command moves a folder or file from one 
location to another. (I told you that all this character-based stuff would start 
to make sense, didn’t I?) To demonstrate, this command moves MyDocument 
from the Desktop folder to the current user’s Home folder:
mv ~/Desktop/MyDocument ~/MyDocument
Ah, but here’s the hidden surprise: The mv command also functions as 
a rename command. For instance, to rename a file MyDocument on the 
Desktop to MyNewDocument, do this:
mv ~/Desktop/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyNewDocument
In this case, you can see that the mv command is really copying the original 
file to the destination and then deleting the original. Because both folders in 
this example reside in the same folder (~/Desktop/), it appears as though 
the mv command has renamed the file.
Again, like the cp command, the mv command requires that you have 
proper permissions for the action that you want to perform. Use the sudo 
command to perform any commands that your current user (as displayed 
in the prompt) isn’t allowed to execute. On UNIX systems, not all users are 
necessarily equal. Some users can perform functions that others can’t. This 
is handy for keeping your child’s mitts off important files on your computer. 
It also creates a hurdle should you choose to work on files while using your 
child’s restricted user account. The sudo command lets you temporarily 
become another user — presumably one that has permission to perform 
some function that the current user can’t.
What would file manipulation be without the ability to delete files? Never 
fear; UNIX can delete anything that you throw at it. Use the rm (short for 
remove) or rmdir (short for remove directory) command to delete a folder 
or file. For example, to delete MyNewDocument from the Desktop folder, 
execute the rm command like this:
rm ~/Desktop/MyNewDocument
 
Once again, deleting files and folders requires that you have permission 
to do so. In other words, any time that you manipulate files with the com-
mand line, you’re required to have the proper permission. If your current 
user lacks these permissions, using sudo helps. You should also check to 
make sure that your target is correctly spelled and that no pesky spaces that 
could wreak carnage are lurking in the command.

Useful Commands
Opening documents and launching applications
Launching applications and opening documents is child’s play for a UNIX 
pro like you. The open command does it all. For example, to bring the Finder 
to the foreground without touching the mouse, use
open /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app
To open a document from the command line, follow a similar scheme. 
For example, to view an image named myImage.tif that’s stored in your 
Documents folder using Preview, try this:
open ~/Documents/myImage.tif
Useful Commands
Manipulating files and viewing folder content is fun, but the command line is 
capable of so much more! Now I focus your attention on some of the other 
useful tasks that you can perform with the command line.
 
Mac OS X comes stocked with a full set of useful commands. You can 
discover what commands are installed by viewing the files in /usr/bin. 
Type cd /usr/bin to navigate there.
Calendar
One of my favorite command-line functions is the cal command, which 
displays a calendar in text form. Simply entering cal at the prompt displays a 
calendar for the current month, as shown in Figure 1-4.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Type cal 
to view a 
calendar for 
the current 
month.
 

652
Useful Commands
Append a number to the cal command to display a 12-month calendar for 
that year. The number that follows the cal command is the year for which 
you’d like to see a calendar. For example, to view a calendar for 1970, type 
cal 1970. The result appears in Figure 1-5.
 
Figure 1-5: 
Type cal 
followed by 
a year to 
view the 12 
months of 
that year.
 
Append a month number and a year number to display the calendar for that 
month. For example, to view a calendar for April 2010, type cal 04 2010.
 
Use the –m flag to specify the current year, as in cal –m 08 for August of this 
year.
Another useful command that’s related to the cal command is date. Type 
date at the command line to display the day, date, time, and year based on 
your computer’s settings.

Processes
Have you ever been curious as to why your hard drive seems to spin and 
grind on occasion while your system is seemingly inactive? Mac OS X 
sometimes has a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes. To discover just 
what your computer is busy doing at any time, use the top command to 
display all the actions that your computer is currently performing, as shown 

Book VIII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX 
Lurks Beneath
653
Useful Commands
in Figure 1-6. These activities are called processes; some are created when 
you launch applications, and others are simply tasks that Mac OS X has to 
take care of to keep things running smoothly.
 
Figure 1-6: 
The top 
command 
displays 
all running 
processes.
 
Besides listing the names of the various processes currently in use, top tells 
you how much of your CPU is being devoted to each process. This lets you 
know what process is currently hogging all your computing power.
Sometimes a process stalls, effectively freezing that action. By using the top 
command to find the Process ID (PID) of the offending process, you can halt 
the process. Simply use the kill command followed by the PID of the process 
that you want to stop. (The man help page for the kill command gives 
more options that may help terminate stubborn processes with prejudice.)
 
Do not go killing processes with a cavalier attitude! Although Mac OS X is 
extremely stable, removing the wrong process — such as init or mach_
init — is rather like removing a leg from one of those deep-sea drilling 
platforms: the very definition of Not Good. You could lock up your system 
and lose whatever you’re doing in other applications. If you simply want 
to shut down a misbehaving program, go graphical again (at least for a 
moment) and use the Force Quit menu command from the Finder menu.
Like top, another handy command for examining process info is ps (short 
for process). Most often, you’ll want to append a few flags to the ps command 
to get the information that you desire. For example, try the following 
command:

654
UNIX Cadillac Commands
ps –aux
The man page for ps explains what each flag means. (Read more about using 
the man command in the earlier section “Help is on the way!”)
UNIX Cadillac Commands
Besides working with files and processes, the command line has all kinds 
of sophisticated commands. For example, with the command line, you have 
instant access to a variety of tools for finding files or even stringing together 
commands.
Finding files
The command line gives you a number of ways to search for files on your 
hard drive. The two most commonly used commands are find and locate.
To use find, specify a starting point for the search followed by the name of 
the file or folder that you want to find. For example, to find the Fonts folder 
that belongs to your user, enter the command like this:
find ~/ -name “Fonts”
You should see at least one result of the find command.
/Users/markchambers//Library/Fonts
One great feature of the find command is that you can look for a file or 
folder in more than one location. Suppose you want to find a file named 
MyDocument that you know resides either in your Documents folder or on 
your Desktop. For this kind of search, use the find command like this:
find ~/Documents ~/Desktop -name “MyDocument”
In this example, you are telling the find command which folders it should 
search when looking for the file named MyDocument.
Using pipes
Nearly all UNIX commands can take on greater abilities by using a construct 
called the pipe. A pipe (|) is represented by that funny little vertical line that 
shows up when you press Shift+\. The pipe routes data from one command 
to another one that follows — for example, many UNIX commands produce 
large amounts of information that can’t all fit on one page. (You might have 
noticed this behavior when you used the locate command.) Joining two 
commands or functions together with the pipe command is piping. To tame 
the screens full of text, pipe the find function to the less command. The 
less command provides data one page at a time.

find ~/ -name “Fonts” | less
When the results fill up one page, the data stops and waits for you to press 
any key (except the Q key) to continue. When you reach the end of the 
results, press Q to quit and return to a command-line prompt.
UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
As a Macintosh user, you might be surprised to know that many applications 
on your hard drive don’t reside in one of the typical Applications folders of 
Mac OS X. These applications, in fact, don’t have any graphical user interface 
like what you’re accustomed to. They’re accessible only from the command 
line. The remainder of this chapter covers some of these applications.
Text editors
UNIX has many text-editing applications for use at the command line. Some 
of the more popular ones include pico, vi, and emacs. Each of these text 
editors has its pros and cons — and say thanks to the thorough folks at 
Apple, because all three are included with Snow Leopard! For my examples 
here, however, I use pico because it’s simple to use and sufficient for our 
needs.
Creating a new document
To create a text file by using pico, simply type pico at the command line. 
The result looks like Figure 1-7.

This is the rough-and-tumble world of UNIX, which preceded the Macintosh 
by many years. Perhaps this will also help you to appreciate why the 
Macintosh was so revolutionary when it was introduced. (You can just hear 
the designers crowing, “We’ll call this a menu! Yeah, that’s the ticket!” The 
only graphics that you’d see on your monitor were the comics and sticky 
notes that you stuck to the bottom.)
At the bottom of the screen is a menu of common commands. Above the 
menu is a large, empty space where you can enter text, much the same as in 
the word processors that you already know and love. (For those of us that 
remember the halcyon character-based days of DOS, think older versions of 
Word and WordPerfect . . . or, if you’re a real computing dinosaur like I am, 
consider the original WordStar.) Type some text in that area. Anything will 
do . . . a letter to a friend, a grocery list, or your school homework.
When you’re finished entering your desired text, save the document with 
the WriteOut command in the pico menu. Directly next to each command 
in the pico menu is a keyboard sequence used to perform that command. 
(Refer to the bottom of Figure 1-7.) The # character is shorthand for the 
Control key on your keyboard. Thus, to save a file, press #+O. This flies 
in the face of standard Mac keyboard conventions, where the letter O is 
traditionally used to mean Open.
After pressing the Control+O sequence, pico prompts you for a filename. 
As with most UNIX files, you’re permitted to enter a simple filename here or 
a full path to a file. For this example, save the file to your Documents folder, 
naming it MyPicoDocument.
After you’ve completed and saved the document, pressing Control+X will 
transport you away from Planet Pico and back to the command line.
Networking with the Terminal
Because UNIX isn’t a new phenomenon, it has many useful networking 
abilities built into it. In fact, UNIX was instrumental in creating much of what 
we now take for granted: e-mail, the Internet, and the World Wide Web. Thus, 
you’ll be happy to know that you can communicate over networks with the 
Terminal in practically any manner that you can dream of . . . and then some!
WWW and FTP
If you’ve used the Internet for any time, you’re probably familiar with the 
various means to transport data over a network. From FTP (short for File 
Transfer Protocol) and Telnet to e-mail and the Web, UNIX can handle it all. 
In fact, UNIX has a command for each of these functions (and many more 
that have passed into historical obscurity). Rather than use each individual 
command to send and retrieve data with the Terminal, Apple has conveniently 

Book VIII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX 
Lurks Beneath
657
UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
provided a command that can handle them all: curl. The curl command is 
competent at all the standard network protocols. To see it in action, pass a 
Web address (or URL, to The Enlightened) to the curl command:
curl http://www.mlcbooks.com
The result is that you see the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page 
that’s located at www.mlcbooks.com. Because this isn’t particularly useful 
for most people (it’s not very easy to read), you need to add the letter o as a 
flag. This specifies where you would like to save this file upon download. To 
save the HTML page to your Home directory, add the -o flag and a path to 
the destination file.
 
Don’t forget to precede all flags with a hyphen. For this example, it would 
be -o.
curl -o ~/mlcbooks.html http://www.mlcbooks.com
If you now perform an ls command, you see that curl has, in fact, 
downloaded the HTML found at www.mlcbooks.com and saved it to a file 
named mlcbooks.html in your Home directory.
The beauty of curl is that it does much more than just retrieve Web pages: 
It’s equally comfortable with FTP transfers. FTP is used to download (or 
receive) files from a server as well as upload (or send) them. Like the 
previous HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) examples, you only have to 
provide an FTP address in Uniform Resource Locator (URL) format, and 
curl will take care of the rest. Of course, most people want to save any files 
that they download via FTP — not view them in the Terminal as I did the 
HTML file. Therefore, as in the previous example, you should add the -o 
flag and a path to the destination of your download. This time, I download a 
README file about curl directly from the makers of curl.
curl -o ~/Desktop/README.curl ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/www/utilities/curl/README.
curl
If you’re familiar with FTP, you might be wondering whether curl can 
upload, too. Yes, indeed! Instead of using the -o flag, you need to use two 
flags: -T and -u. The -T flag denotes which file you want to upload. The -u 
flag denotes the username and password. Then, specify the FTP destination 
address of where you want to upload it. Because this example deals with an 
upload, the remainder of this example is for an imaginary FTP server. In real 
life, you’d use the appropriate FTP address, username, and password for an 
FTP server where you are allowed to upload.
curl -T /Desktop/README.curl -u username:passwd ftp://ftp.yoursitehere.com
/myfiles/README.curl

658
UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
This example uploads the README.curl file from the Desktop folder that I 
downloaded earlier to an imaginary FTP server.
How do you spell success? C-u-r-l!
Sure, HTTP and FTP are handy, but did you know that there are many 
other protocols for network communications? One of the niftier ones is the 
Dictionary protocol. With it, you can look up words from any server that 
understands the protocol. Suppose, for example, that you want to know the 
meaning of the term DVD. Enter the following command to find out:
curl dict://dict.org/d:DVD
With curl, Dictionary, and your Dictionary Dashboard widget on the same 
Macintosh, you might never use a “real” paper dictionary again!

sing a Macintosh is supposed to make your life easier — and in many 
ways, it does. But there’s a limit to how much your Mac can do by 
itself, right? After all, you still have to move the mouse, press keys on the 
keyboard, and read information on the screen to get things done . . . or do 
you? Why not let your computer do the dull chores — such as renaming 
a thousand digital photographs from your family vacation and organizing 
them into folders based on the subject of each photo — for you? Although 
most people are familiar with controlling their Macs with the mouse and 
keyboard, few realize that they can operate their machines without touching 
a key or a mouse button, or even glancing at the screen.
What’s So Great about AppleScript?
If one word could describe what AppleScript is all about, it’d be automation. 
AppleScript is a technology for automating practically any action that you 
perform with your Macintosh, including both common tasks in the Finder 
and those that you perform in other applications.
Automate common tasks in the Finder
If you’ve ever found yourself repeating some task more than once, you’re 
an ideal candidate for becoming an AppleScript techno-wizard. AppleScript 
is particularly good at taking the boredom and tedium out of using your 
Macintosh by performing all sorts of tasks automatically. To illustrate, 
consider a few jobs that would take a fair amount of time to do by hand but 
are a snap with AppleScript:

660
What’s So Great about AppleScript?
 
✦ While writing your next best-selling Great American Novel — or For 
Dummies book on Mac OS X — you make a mistake and misnumber the 
chapters. All the chapters have a filename bearing the chapter number, 
but they’re all off by one. Sure, you could rename each file by hand, but 
your book is a large tome and renumbering 42 chapters manually 
doesn’t sound like much fun. (Take my word for it. Please.) It’ll require 
several minutes and lots of tedious attention on your part, not to mention 
introduce the likelihood of human error. But wait, there’s another way! 
When using a simple AppleScript of only a few lines of code, you can 
rename the chapters in seconds whilst you go grab another Diet Coke.
 
✦ You’re a neat individual and think that your Mac should reflect your 
penchant for order — in fact, you like your Desktop icons to be placed 
just so. Being left-handed, you prefer the icons over on the left side of 
the Desktop, like some of those inferior operating systems. In this situation, 
an AppleScript can help you do things that aren’t humanly possible; 
not only can you rapidly rearrange the icons on your Desktop, but you 
can do so with pixel-point accuracy. Without AppleScript, it’d be nearly 
impossible to precisely align dozens of icons. And if you could, it would 
take a long time and probably cause you to go blind.
 
✦ After a font-download binge, you find yourself with hundreds of fonts. 
You really want to organize them into separate folders based on the date 
that you downloaded them. AppleScript comes to the rescue again! With 
a brief script, you could knock out this challenge without ever 
looking at a single date. Add a couple more lines of code to the script, 
and AppleScript will take care of creating the folders, too. Right, you 
know the word: sassy.
Automate tasks in other applications
By using AppleScript, you can also often automate your work from beginning 
to end, despite the fact that you need multiple applications to do so. Look 
at a few scenarios, and you’ll begin to appreciate why AppleScript is such a 
powerful technology:
 
✦ You’ve just completed creating the ultimate library of bagpipe songs in 
iTunes — no, really! — and you want to share the list with your friends 
at the next Bagpipers Anonymous meeting. You could easily send 
everyone in the group an iTunes Playlist, but not everyone in the club 
has a Macintosh, let alone a computer. This is going to require creating 
a hard copy for those members without a computer. Because your 
bagpipe song list contains thousands of songs, you don’t want to retype 
the name of each song. AppleScript can save the day by extracting the 
song titles for you and compiling them into a list just in time for your 
meeting.
 
✦ AppleScript can take care of your computer-owning bagpipe friends, too. 
With a few extra steps, you can e-mail all of them the list as well.

✦ Being so doggone fond of bagpipes, you want to send your bagpiping 
friends a special note during the holidays. To help manage your holiday 
greeting cards, you can create a record in FileMaker Pro or some other 
database listing the name and address of each person who should 
receive a card. If you’ve entered their street addresses in the Contacts 
section of your e-mail application, AppleScript can aid in transferring 
the addresses from your e-mail application to the database. Never again 
will your bagpiping friends miss a holiday greeting . . . and the world is a 
much better place.
As you can imagine, there are literally thousands of ways that you can use 
AppleScript to automate your workflow. (Whoops, I just used a BST, or 
Business Software Term. A workflow is a single document or project that one 
or more people work on using multiple applications. In other words, your 
document can be automatically manipulated in multiple applications using 
the same script.) 
Running a Script
The easiest way to get started with AppleScript is to use some scripts that 
others have written already. Scripts are small files that contain a list of 
commands; this list of commands tells your Mac what function to perform 
and when to perform it. Fortunately, Apple is kind enough to provide you 
with several completed scripts with your installation of Snow Leopard. You 
can find a large cache of scripts in the scripts folder, found in the Library 
folder, under Scripts.
Many scripts (but not all) end with the extension .scpt. Before you get 
started running scripts, however, you should know a few things.
Identifying scripts in the field
Each script that you encounter will be in one of these three formats:
 
✦ Script application: Some AppleScripts act much like an application. To 
use one, simply double-click it in the Finder, and off it goes to perform 
whatever tasks it was meant to do. Depending on an internal setting of 
the script, it might quit when it’s finished doing its thing. Most often, the 
script completes its mission and quits. Scripts are typically identified by 
the icon that you see in Figure 2-1.
 
✦ Compiled script: You might also encounter AppleScripts that won’t 
run without the aid of another application. Apple calls these compiled 
scripts. Although they can’t execute on their own, they do have the 
abilities of a script built in. They just require a host application to use 
them.

662
Running a Script
 
Figure 2-1: 
A gaggle 
of typical 
script icons

the camera.
 
 
✦ Text file: In addition to compiled scripts and those that act like 
applications, a third category of AppleScript that you might encounter 
is a script stored in a text file. Scripts that are stored in a text file also 
need a host application before they’ll do anything. The main difference 
between a text file script and a compiled script is that you can read a 
text file script with any application that can open a text file.
The AppleScript Editor application
Two of the three possible script types (compiled scripts and text files) 
require some sort of host application before they’ll perform any action. 
Luckily, Snow Leopard provides you with just such a host: the AppleScript 
Editor application, which comes with Mac OS X and can execute any 
AppleScript with ease. With the AppleScript Editor, you can also do much 
more, including
 
✦ View or modify an AppleScript
 
✦ Create a new AppleScript
 
✦ Check an AppleScript for errors
 
✦ Save scripts in one of the three possible formats
To launch the AppleScript Editor application, navigate to the Utilities folder 
(open your Applications folder and then open the Utilities folder) and 
double-click the AppleScript Editor icon. The AppleScript Editor application 
displays an empty, script-editing window, as shown in Figure 2-2.

Executing a script
After you have the AppleScript Editor application running, you can run any 
AppleScript that you can find. To get you started, Apple has conveniently 
provided a handful of useful scripts. Navigate to the Scripts folder, which is 
located in the Library folder.
 
The scripts are divided into folders based on functionality, such as fonts, 
mail and navigation. For example, open the Font Book folder, where you’ll 
find a script named Delete Empty Collections.scpt.
Double-click the script to open it. Because it’s a compiled script and not 
an application script, the AppleScript Editor automatically loads the script 
and comes to the foreground (see Figure 2-3). This particular script opens 
the Font Book application and checks for empty font collections. If any are 
found, the script displays a prompt asking for confirmation and then deletes 
the empty collection if you click the OK button. To see the script in action, 
click the Run button or press Ô+R.

Writing Your Own Simple Scripts
Using someone else’s scripts is fun and all, but the real joy of AppleScript 
comes when you create your own. Not only can you customize a script to 
your own needs and desires, but saving all those keystrokes can really 
produce a feeling of euphoria. (Okay, perhaps just Snow Leopard power 
users will actually experience a heightened sense of existence . . . you’ll be 
there soon.)
Create a script without touching a key
You needn’t wear a pocket protector or tape the bridge of your glasses to 
become proficient with AppleScript. In fact, the AppleScript Editor can get 
you up and running with AppleScript in no time at all. The secret weapon of 
the AppleScript author is the Record function of the AppleScript Editor. 
You click the Record button, perform one or more actions in a recordable 
application, and then return to the AppleScript Editor, where you click the 
Stop button. The AppleScript Editor stores each of your actions and compiles 
the whole list into an AppleScript.
 
In theory, this is how it should all work, but in reality, finding recordable 
Macintosh applications isn’t always so easy. The Finder is, perhaps, the 
most recordable application on the Mac. Although some other applications 
support recording, so few do that the Finder could be the only recordable 
application most Mac users ever see.
To try it yourself, take the following steps to automate actions in the Finder:
 
1. Bring AppleScript Editor to the foreground.
 
 If AppleScript Editor isn’t currently running, double-click its icon in a 
Finder window. If it is running, click its icon in the Dock.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
AppleScript Just 
Plain Rocks
665
Writing Your Own Simple Scripts
 
2. Create a new script by pressing Ô+N.
 
3. Click the Record button.
 
 The Record button is one of four buttons positioned near the top left of 
a new script window. Refer to Figure 2-3.
 
4. Switch to the Finder and perform the actions that you want to automate.
 
 When the Finder is active, you can select some icons on the Desktop and 
move them around, resize any open Finder windows, or navigate to your 
home directory. Any action that you perform in the Finder should be 
acceptable fodder for the AppleScript Editor. When you perform tasks in 
the Finder, the AppleScript Editor automatically generates a script that 
replicates your actions.
 
5. Return to the AppleScript Editor and click the Stop button.
 
 To reactivate the AppleScript Editor, click its icon in the Dock. Click the 
Stop button to cease the recording of your script.
When you’re finished, you should be looking at a complete AppleScript. To 
test your work, return to the Finder and return any icons or windows that 
you might have moved or repositioned to their original locations. (You don’t 
want to run a script that doesn’t appear to have any effect.) Then return to 
the AppleScript Editor and click the Run button to watch your automated 
Finder tasks being performed.
Building your own scripts
An AppleScript novice can perform all kinds of amazing feats with the 
recording features of the AppleScript Editor. Because AppleScript uses a 
kind of pseudo-English language, it’s usually pretty easy to figure out what’s 
going on behind the scenes. Consider the following script for an example:
tell app “Finder”
   activate
   set windowList to every window -- save list of open 
windows
   repeat with theWindow in windowList
      tell theWindow
         if collapsed is true then
         -- do nothing, because the window is collapsed
         else
            set collapsed to true
         end if
      end tell
   end repeat
end tell
 (By the way, in the preceding code, I bolded and italicized the commands 
you’ll be working with, but they don’t have to be bolded for the script to 
work.) Anyway, the first thing that you might notice about this script is the 

666
One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
first line: the tell command, which indicates that this script relates to the 
Finder. This script activates the Finder, creates a list of open windows, and 
then examines the state of each window: Is it collapsed or not collapsed? (In 
Snow Leopard, a collapsed, or minimized, window appears in the Dock.)
One of two possible results occurs:
 
✦ If the window is already minimized and in the Dock, nothing happens 
and the script continues through the list of windows.
 
✦ If the window isn’t minimized, the script collapses it.
This continues until the script has examined all open windows. The end 
result? All open windows end up minimized in the Dock.
Another thing to note about this script is that it has two comments in it 
(save list and do nothing). Comments can help you remember what you 
were thinking months later when you open the script again. Although com-
ments help us humans know what’s happening, they don’t really have any 
other function. An AppleScript comment begins with two dashes (--).
Here’s a big-time Mark’s Maxim that every script author should remember:
 
Comments are your friend!
One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
Creating AppleScripts can soon become very involved, bordering on 
programming. Don’t let that term programming scare you away, though. 
You needn’t be a software developer to take advantage of AppleScripts. 
Apple provides a lot of help to get you started along the AppleScript trail.
Grab the Dictionary
Perhaps the greatest resource for AppleScript novices and experts alike 
is the AppleScript Dictionary. Although many applications are scriptable, 
not all are. To be scriptable, an application must contain an AppleScript 
Dictionary. An AppleScript Dictionary details the various commands and 
objects of an application that you can access via AppleScript.
The AppleScript Editor application allows you to peer inside an application 
and view its AppleScript Dictionary. To open an application’s Dictionary, 
choose File➪Open Dictionary. Mac OS X searches through your installed

applications and presents you with the Open Dictionary dialog, as shown 
in Figure 2-4, which lists all applications that have a dictionary and are 
therefore scriptable.
 
Figure 2-4:

Editor.
 
 
If you don’t see your favorite application in the list, alas, it’s probably 
not scriptable. To make certain, click the Browse button and select the 
application in question.
After you select an application and click Choose, the AppleScript Editor 
displays that application’s AppleScript Dictionary. An application’s 
dictionary lists all the features of that application that are scriptable.
Scriptable features are divided into categories, called Suites, which you can 
see on the left side of the AppleScript Dictionary. Every Mac application is 
supposed to support the Standard Suite, which lists common terms that 
most applications should support.
Click an item in the Suite on the left side of the Dictionary to view detailed 
information about its capabilities, as shown in Figure 2-5.
By surveying the various Suites of an application, you begin to see what 
tasks you can automate. The Finder, with its huge AppleScript Dictionary, is 
perhaps the most scriptable of all applications.

Anatomy of a simple script
Although a full discussion of AppleScript programming is beyond the scope 
of this book — after all, we have other things to talk about, too — that 
doesn’t mean that you can’t produce some quick and useful scripts. Most 
AppleScripts begin with a command that addresses the application that you 
want to automate. Enter this command into a new AppleScript document, 
which you create by pressing Ô+N.
tell application “Finder”
This is like saying, “Hey, Finder, listen up! I’m going to send commands 
your way!” The double quotation marks surround the application name that 
you’re addressing in the command.
Similarly, after you finish instructing the Finder what tasks you want 
performed, you must also tell it to stop listening. As such, typical scripts 
end with
end tell
With the shell of a script in place, all you have to do is add commands 
between the tell and end tell commands of the script. If you want your 
script to force an application to the foreground, an activate command is 
usually the first line within the shell of your script.

One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
tell application “Finder”
  activate
end tell
Believe it or not, this is technically a complete and valid script! It doesn’t 
do much, though, so add some more functionality to make it accomplish 
something worthwhile. For example, suppose you want to perform some 
housekeeping chores each time you log in to your Macintosh. Some 
desirable tasks might include
 
✦ Emptying the Trash
 
✦ Having your Mac say “Hello!” to you
(Okay, I’ll grant that hearing your Mac say “Hello!” isn’t a housekeeping 
chore, but it makes the whole script that much more fun — and really 
impresses your visitors, too. No one ever said programming had to be 
boring!)
To add these functions, you can do so by using a language you already know: 
English. As I mention earlier, Apple tries (and sometimes succeeds) to make 
AppleScript as English-like as possible. That way, you don’t have to know 
some silly computer language; just use your native tongue. For example, to 
empty the Trash, tell the Finder to do so.
empty trash
The trickiest line of code might be the speech, and that’s only because you 
need to remember to add quotation marks. AppleScript thinks that anything 
without quotation marks is an AppleScript command.
say “Hello!”
The result is a super-simple script that anyone can read but that performs 
two powerful functions. The completed script looks like this:
tell app “Finder”
  activate
  empty trash
  say “Hello!”
end tell
After you complete the script, choose File➪Save to save your script. Because 
you want the script to execute and then quit, use the File Format field to 
save it as an Application. Also, make sure that the Stay Open check box and 
the Startup Screen check box are deselected. And don’t forget to name your 
script in the Save As text field.

670
I Summon Automator — the Silicon Programmer!
 
To have the script automatically run each time you log in to your Mac, save 
the script anywhere you wish. (Assign its location in the Where field of the 
Save window.) Open System Preferences by clicking its icon in the Dock; 
then click the Accounts icon. Make sure that your account is selected and 
then click Login Items. Click the Add button (which proudly bears a plus 
sign) and navigate to your script in the Open dialog that appears. After you 
click the Add button of the Open dialog, you see the script in the Login Items 
window.
I Summon Automator — the Silicon Programmer!
Okay, perhaps I’ve watched too much “Iron Chef” over the years. Anyway, 
Snow Leopard features Automator (as shown in Figure 2-6) — he’s your own 
personal robotic AppleScript assistant. In fact, Automator can help you 
create custom applications that can handle your repetitive tasks. Again, 
you’re creating workflows here, which are sequential (and repeatable) 
operations that are performed on the same files or data, and your Automator 
application can automatically launch whatever applications are necessary to 
get the job done.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Automator 
is a dream 
come true 
for those 
who hate 
repetitive 
tasks.
 
Here’s a great example: You work with a service bureau that sends you a CD 
every week with new product shots for your company’s Marketing department. 
Unfortunately, these images are flat-out huge — taken with a 12-megapixel 
camera — and they’re always in the wrong orientation. Before you move 
them to the Marketing folder on your server, you have to laboriously resize 
each image and rotate it, and then save the smaller version.

I Summon Automator — the Silicon Programmer!
With Automator’s help, you can build a custom application that automatically 
reads each image in the folder, resizes it, rotates it, and even generates a 
thumbnail image or prints the image, and then moves the massaged images 
to the proper folder. You’d normally have to manually launch Preview to 
perform the image operations and then use a Finder window to move the 
new files to the right location. But now, with Automator, double-clicking 
your custom application icon does the trick.
You’ll find Automator in your Applications folder. Currently, Automator can 
handle specific tasks within about 60 applications (including the Finder), but 
both Apple and third-party developers are busy adding new Automator task 
support to all sorts of new and existing applications.
To create a simple application using Automator, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Custom and click Choose.
 
2. Click the desired application in the Library list.
 
 Automator displays the actions available within that application.
 
3. Drag the desired action from the Library window to the workflow 
window.
 
4. Modify any specific settings provided for the action you chose.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1–3 to complete the workflow.
 
6. Click Run (upper right) to test your script.
 
 Use sample files (copies) while you’re fine-tuning your application 
lest you accidentally do something deleterious to an original (and 
irreplaceable) file!
 
 Figure 2-7 illustrates an application that will take care of the earlier 
example — resizing and rotating a folder full of images, and then moving 
them to the Pictures folder.
 
7. When the application is working as you like, press Ô+Shift+S to 
save it.
 
8. In the Save dialog that appears, type a name for your new application.
 
9. Click the Where pop-up menu and specify a location where the file 
should be saved.
 
10. Click Save.
 
To find all the actions of a certain type within the Library list, click in the 
Search box at the bottom of the Library window and type in a keyword, such 
as save or burn. You don’t even need to press Return!

Help Is at Your Fingertips
If you want to explore AppleScript further, you have many resources on 
hand. Sometimes the easiest way to use AppleScript is to copy existing 
scripts and modify them as necessary; other times, it’s a good idea to read 
the documentation included in Apple’s Help system. Whichever approach 
you use, with a little practice and guidance, you’ll soon be doing stupendous 
tasks with your Mac.
Built-in AppleScript Help
The most readily available AppleScript reference is built into Mac OS 
X. From within Automator, choose Help➪Automator Help to launch 
the Automator Help Guide, or choose Help➪AppleScript Help from the 
AppleScript Editor. The latter is a great place to begin your AppleScript 
exploration. It includes detailed documentation about the AppleScript 
language and loads of demonstration scripts for you to try (or alter) 
yourself.
AppleScript on the Web
In addition to the built-in AppleScript help in the Finder, the Internet has 
much to offer in the way of AppleScript training and examples. As are so 
many other excellent Web resources, AppleScripts are free!
Not all AppleScripts are created equal: When downloading scripts from 
the Internet, make sure that they’re compatible with Snow Leopard 
(Mac OS X v. 10.6).

The first place on the Web that you should visit for AppleScript help is the 
Source of All That Is Good, also called the Mother Ship: Apple Computer. 
Although the built-in OS X help offers a lot, the Apple Web site offers even 
more scripts, tutorials, and general AppleScript goodness. You can even find 
a list of all known scriptable applications, which can save you from searching 
for them with Script Editor. Furthermore, the site maintains an extensive list 
of links to other useful AppleScript sites.

Automator World devotes its site to all Macintosh scripting. Because 
AppleScript is such a huge part of scripting the Mac OS, you can be 
certain that there’s something here for you. Besides offering up-to-date 
news on Automator scripting for the Mac OS, Automator World also gives 
you access to many scripts, information about scripting books, and details 
on AppleScripts with interfaces. The sheer volume of information at this site

Chapter 3: Talking and Writing 
to Your Macintosh
In This Chapter
✓ Using handwriting recognition to control Mac OS X
✓ Speaking to your Mac
✓ Having your Mac speak back
✓ Using VoiceOver to provide feedback in Snow Leopard
I
f you’re a hunt-and-peck typist — leaving you certain that there must 
be some better way to get information into your computer — you’ll be 
happy to know that Apple has you in mind. Since the very first Mac rolled 
off the assembly line, Apple has had a keen interest in alternative modes of 
interaction between human and machine. Mac OS X continues in this tradition 
of alternative computer controls, offering two options for controlling Mac 
OS X without the keyboard: handwriting and speech.
 
✦ Handwriting: By using a pen and computer tablet, you can enter text 
into your Mac by simply writing as you would on a sheet of paper.
 
✦ Speech: Talk to your Mac to make it listen and obey your commands. It 
even talks back!
This chapter guides you through the various options that you have for 
controlling your Macintosh without using the keyboard. First, I cover the 
Mac OS X Ink feature, which you use to write on a tablet to enter data into 
your computer. (Although it sounds a bit ironic, think of Ink as your “digital 
paper” for the new millennium.) Whatever you write on the tablet appears 
on the screen as text.
I also take a look at the more space-age speech capabilities available to you 
in Mac OS X. With your voice, you can command a Macintosh to perform 
all sorts of interesting feats. And just so you don’t get lonely, the Mac even 
talks back to you. (Now you can control your computer just as Spock from 
“Star Trek” could!) And Snow Leopard’s VoiceOver feature makes it easy 
for your Mac to read aloud all sorts of text, including Web pages, Mail 
messages, and word processing documents.
So scoot away from your computer, lean that chair back, and let your Mac 
take care of the rest.

676
Using Ink with a Tablet
Using Ink with a Tablet
Typing on a keyboard can be a tedious and error-prone experience for even 
the best typists. To help out, Apple added some useful handwriting features 
to Mac OS X. Based in part on some of Apple’s handheld software for the 
Newton (one of the first personal digital assistants [PDAs] and a product 
released before its time), the handwriting recognition in Mac OS X gives you 
the ability to write text on a compatible tablet for use in your favorite appli-
cations.
The basic process of working with handwriting on Mac OS X goes like this:
 
1. Attach a tablet to your Mac.
 
 Most tablets use a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, so connecting 
one to your computer is as simple as plugging in the cable from your 
tablet to the USB port on your Mac.
 
2. Write on the tablet with the stylus that accompanies it.
 
 A stylus is the name given the fake “pen” that accompanies most tablets. 
A stylus doesn’t have any ink in it: It’s just a pen-shaped tool with a 
plastic tip meant for writing on a tablet.
 
3. Your Mac interprets your handwriting.
 
 After your Mac recognizes the handwriting, it sends that text to the 
foremost application at the cursor location where you would normally 
type with the keyboard. You’re spared the whole training bit, too.
You aren’t restricted to writing just text on the tablet, naturally. You can 
use it to control the interface of your Mac as you would a mouse. A tablet 
also works great for graphics applications, such as Corel Painter and Adobe 
Photoshop. Many artists are frustrated when drawing with a mouse; when 
you use a tablet, though, you can feel right at home with the natural pen or 
brush movements that you’ve always used.
Although Snow Leopard takes care of handwriting recognition, it does offer 
you a few settings in the Ink pane within System Preferences. To view the 
System Preferences, click the System Preferences icon in the Dock. From 
there, click the Ink icon to adjust settings for your tablet.
 
If you don’t have a tablet connected to your Macintosh, you can’t view the 
System Preferences pane for Ink. Mac OS X is smart enough to show you 
only the settings for your current hardware setup.

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
Computer, Can You Hear Me?
Remember that classic scene from the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage 
Home in which Scotty picks up the mouse on a Macintosh and tries to talk 
directly to the computer? Since the very early days of the Mac OS, Apple has 
included some form of speech recognition in its computers. Snow Leopard 
continues to improve on speech recognition by offering a host of tools that 
let you get more work done in a shorter amount of time. (We’re not to that 
point yet, Scotty, but we’re working on it.)
The Speech Recognition features of Mac OS X let you speak a word, phrase, 
or sentence. After you’ve spoken, your Mac goes to work translating what 
you said — and if it understands the phrase, it then performs an action 
associated with that phrase. The great part about this system is that you can 
say any phrase in continuous speech and have your Mac perform any sort of 
action that you can imagine. In fact, you aren’t limited to just one action: You 
can perform dozens of actions upon speaking a particular phrase.
Before you get started using Speech Recognition, you need a microphone 
to get sound into your Mac. Virtually all current Macintosh models have a 
built-in microphone; for example, if you use an Intel iMac, your microphone 
is built into the monitor. MacBooks have a similar microphone built into the 
screen. If your Mac doesn’t have a microphone, connect one to the rear of 
your Macintosh by plugging it into the microphone jack.
 
If you’re looking for the best quality audio input from your microphone for 
use with iChat, check out a microphone with a USB connection. You’ll get far 
better sound quality than a microphone that connects to your analog jack.
The Speech Recognition tab
To get started with Speech Recognition in Mac OS X, open the System 
Preferences window by clicking its icon in the Dock and then clicking the 
Speech icon. This brings up the Speech pane, as shown in Figure 3-1.
You’ll find that two tabs comprise the speech settings of Mac OS X:
 
✦ Speech Recognition
 
✦ Text to Speech
In this section, I’m concerned only with the Speech Recognition tab. Later, in 
the “Your Mac Talks Back!” section, I explore the Text to Speech tab.

678
Computer, Can You Hear Me?
 
Figure 3-1: 
Hail and 
well met, 
good 
Speech 
pane (and 
Feedback 
window)!
 
The Speech Recognition tab consists of two subtabs:
 
✦ Settings: The Settings tab provides a number of settings that control 
how your Mac listens to Its Master’s Voice. (Meaning you, friend reader.) 
From here, you can set the sound input, adjust the key on the keyboard 
that toggles speech recognition on and off, change microphone settings, 
and name your computer with a keyword. (You do want to call your 
computer by name as any techno-wizard does, don’t you?)
 
✦ Commands: When Speech Recognition is active, your Mac can 
understand any number of commands. From the Commands tab, you 
tell the Mac what type of command it should expect you to give. You 
can also specify whether you’ll be giving the commands word for word 
or your Mac should be prepared to interpret paraphrasing. A number of 
specific applications and menus can be configured with speakable items, 
such as contact names within Snow Leopard’s Address Book.
Crowning the Speech Recognition pane are the Speakable Items On and Off 
radio buttons. You’ve probably already guessed how to use ’em to switch 
Speech Recognition features on and off.
 
When you select the On radio button, the small circular Speech Recognition 
Feedback window appears on your screen, floating above all other windows. 
Know this face well because the Feedback window (also shown in Figure 3-1) 
is your friend and partner. If you use Speech Recognition often, it’ll become 
a constant companion on your Desktop. (More on it in the next section.)

Book VIII
Chapter 3
Talking and Writing 
to Your Macintosh
679
Computer, Can You Hear Me?
The Settings pane
At the bottom of the Settings pane is the Upon Recognition section. When 
your Mac comprehends one of your stentorian commands, you can set it to 
respond by playing a sound, speaking a confirmation, or both. This is helpful 
when you’re not sure whether your Mac understands you. One hundred 
percent recognition isn’t a reality on any computer at this point, so sometimes 
it helps to have any feedback you can get. Otherwise, you might feel silly 
shouting at your machine while it sits there doing nothing. (Or perhaps not, 
if you’re into really inexpensive anger management.)
You can choose between two styles of listening with the Listening Method 
options:
 
✦ Listen Only While Key Is Pressed: Speech Recognition works only while 
the designated key is held down.
 
✦ Listen Continuously with Keyword: When you speak the keyword, 
listening turns on and remains on.
 
To change what key must be toggled or held down, click the Change Key 
button.
Why change the keyword? Instead of saying, “Computer, empty the Trash!” 
you might prefer, “Elrond, empty the Trash!” This adds a little bit of 
personality to the interaction and also gives your computer a slightly longer 
time to react to your command. (As a general rule, the longer the spoken 
phrase, the more likely your Mac will understand it.) If you select the Listen 
Continuously with Keyword feature, you can change your computer’s name 
via the Keyword text box.
Finally, you can select the microphone that you want to use from the 
Microphone pop-up menu on the Settings pane — a great feature if you have 
more than one microphone connected to your Mac. Click the Calibrate key 
to adjust the sound volume for better recognition.
The Commands pane
When Speech Recognition is active, your Mac listens for whatever phrases 
appear in your Speakable Items folder (a directory on your hard drive 
that holds a number of scripts). The Commands tab (shown in Figure 3-2) 
allows you to view the contents of this folder. When you speak a phrase 
that matches one of these filenames, your Mac automatically executes that 
script. The script can perform any number of actions, which is what makes 
Speech Recognition so powerful. Apple includes a large number of scripts 
with Mac OS X, but you’re free to create your own, too.

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
 
Figure 3-2: 
The 
Commands 
tab allows 
you to

To make something speakable, select the item and then speak the command 
“Make this speakable.” The new speakable command is based upon the 
item’s name.
To view the contents of the Speakable Items folder, click the Open Speakable 
Items Folder button on the Commands pane. The Finder comes to the 
foreground and navigates to the folder that holds the scripts. This is handy 
because each item in the Speakable Items folder is speakable.
 
To the right of the Open Speakable Items Folder button is another button: 
Helpful Tips. Click it to get some pointers on how to get the best performance 
from your microphone.
As I mention in the preceding section, the Speech Recognition features of 
Mac OS X aren’t restricted to items in the Speakable Items folder. Any 
application that supports Speech Recognition is also fair game for your 
verbal manipulation. To control commands within other applications, use 
the Commands tab (refer to Figure 3-2). Here you can select the following 
check boxes:
 
✦ Address Book
 
✦ Global Speakable Items
 
✦ Application Specific Items
 
✦ Application Switching
 
✦ Front Window (requires that you activate assistive devices in the 
Universal Access panel within System Preferences)
 
✦ Menu Bar (requires that you activate assistive devices in the Universal 
Access panel within System Preferences)

Book VIII
Chapter 3

681
Computer, Can You Hear Me?
Mark any one of these options to allow your Mac to listen to those kinds of 
commands.
The Feedback window
After you activate Speech Recognition, you instantly see the Feedback 
window. You can click and drag the edge of the window to position it 
anywhere on your Desktop.
The Feedback window includes controls and displays of its own:
 
✦ Microphone Level Meter: The Feedback window displays indicators to 
let you know how loud the input to your microphone is.
 
✦ Visual Indicator: The Feedback window displays visual feedback to 
let you know what mode it is in: idle, listening, or hearing a command. 
When the microphone isn’t grayed out but there are no arrows on either 
side of the microphone, you’re in listening mode. When the microphone 
is flanked by animated arrows, your computer is hearing a command 
spoken. When Speech Recognition is idle, no arrows are present and the 
microphone is grayed out.
 
✦ Quick-Access Menu: You can quickly access the Speech preferences for 
the System or view the Speech Commands window. Just click the down-
ward-pointing arrow at the bottom of the Feedback window, and a menu 
appears, giving you one-click access to both.
As soon as you disable speech recognition in the System Preferences, the 
Feedback window disappears.
The Speech Command window
Because Speech Recognition might be listening for different sets of commands 
from the Finder or many other applications, Mac OS X provides you with a 
single listing of all commands that you might speak at any given time: the 
Speech Commands window. To open the Speech Commands window, click 
the triangle at the bottom of the Feedback window and choose Open Speech 
Commands Window from the menu that appears.
The Speech Commands window is a simple one, but it serves an important 
purpose: to let you know what commands Mac OS X understands. The 
Speech Commands pane, as shown in Figure 3-3, organizes commands 
into categories that match the settings in the Speech pane of the System 
Preferences.

682
Your Mac Talks Back!
 
Figure 3-3: 
The Speech 
Commands 
window,

work.
 
If you launch another application that supports Speech Recognition, Mac 
OS X adds that application’s commands to the Speech Commands window. 
Speak any of these commands to make your Mac execute that function. For 
example, Mac OS X ships with speech commands for Address Book, such as 
Mail To and Video Chat With.
 
Apple might be a big, serious, computer company — yeah, right — but it 
isn’t without a humorous side! With Speech Recognition enabled, say the 
phrase, “Tell me a joke.” Your Mac replies with a random joke. Say it again, 
and your Mac tells you another joke. (Brace yourself, these jokes were likely 
written by preschoolers . . . they’re really, really bad.) Oh, and if you get a 
“Knock, Knock” joke, remember that you have to actually say, “Who’s 
there?”
Your Mac Talks Back!
Mac OS X is great at listening to your speech, but the fun doesn’t stop there . . . 
your Mac can talk to you, too! By using one of the many available voices — 
including the default Snow Leopard voice, Alex — you can make your com-
puter talk or even sing. (Not as well as Sinatra, but better than Bob Dylan.) 
And although Speech Recognition lets you speak to your Macintosh, the 
VoiceOver feature gives your Mac the ability to speak text. This is an espe-
cially useful feature because it lets you listen to your e-mails, Web pages, or 
even your homework — sometimes the eyes need a break. The text-to-speech 
capability gives you the opportunity to lean back in your chair or even get up 
and walk around while still using your Macintosh.

Book VIII

Text-to-speech settings appear in three places within System Preferences: 
our old friend, the Speech pane; the Date & Time pane; and the VoiceOver 
settings within the Universal Access pane.
The Text to Speech panel
The text-to-speech engine that comes with Snow Leopard has a collection 
of many different voices to choose among; some voices are male, some are 
female, and some aren’t human at all. To select your Mac’s voice in Mac OS 
X, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Speech icon.
 
3. Click the Text to Speech tab, as shown in Figure 3-4.
 
Figure 3-4: 
You can 
select your 
Mac’s 
voice from 
the Text 
to Speech 
pane.
 
 
4. Click the System Voice pop-up menu to choose a voice for your Mac.
 
 To hear the voice, click Play; Snow Leopard speaks a sentence as a 
demonstration. To the left of the Play button is a slider for adjusting the 
speed of the speech. Move the slider to the right to increase the speed 
at which your Mac speaks and to the left to slow it down.
 
Naturally, Alex receives the most attention these days, because he’s the 
default voice for Snow Leopard . . . and Alex definitely provides the most 
natural-sounding tone and best pacing of the bunch. However, I also think 
that the old-school voices, like Bruce and Vicki, are still quite intelligible. 
(I’m a Vicki kinda guy myself.)

684
Your Mac Talks Back!
Talking alerts
After you select a voice, you have a variety of ways to make your Macintosh 
speak automatically to you, based on some simple rules. For example, 
every Mac owner has run into an Alert dialog. (Alert dialogs are typically 
accompanied by a select group of words — better left unspoken — from the 
human behind the keyboard.) An Alert dialog usually displays some kind of 
icon from the following list:
 
✦ Stop sign: Indicates that something particularly important requires your 
attention — usually an error or a dire warning.
 
✦ Yield sign: Signals that you should proceed cautiously; not as severe as 
the Stop sign, but important nonetheless.
 
✦ Notification: Looks like the profile of a person speaking; displays an 
informative message, but not a warning. You could use this feature, for 
example, to have a calendar application alert you when you have a 
meeting or a deadline.
From the Text to Speech panel, you can choose to have your Mac speak a 
specific phrase or the contents of the Alert dialog by selecting one of the 
check boxes at the middle of the panel. If you enable the Announce When 
Alerts Are Displayed check box, click the Set Alert Options button to set 
alert-specific options:
 
✦ Voice: Choose the voice that should speak alerts. (By default, it’s the 
voice you choose earlier.)
 
✦ Phrase: Click this pop-up menu to choose a “prefix” phrase that’s 
spoken before the actual alert text. By default, Snow Leopard speaks the 
name of the application that displayed the alert, but you can also choose 
a phrase from the list or choose to mix up the phrases for a little variety. 
To add or remove phrases, click the Edit Phrases item.
 
✦ Delay: Drag this slider to control the increment of time that Snow 
Leopard allows to pass before it speaks.
To hear what your spoken alert settings sound like in use, click the Play 
button.
 
If you click the Play button on the Set Alert Options sheet and don’t hear 
anything right away, remember that it doesn’t begin speaking until the time 
has elapsed that you set with the Delay slider. To hear the spoken alerts 
speak as soon as you click the Play button, move the slider to 0 (zero).
Other spoken items
In addition to spoken alerts, you can allow your Mac to speak when other 
actions occur. Again, these settings are found on the Text to Speech pane. 
Your Mac can speak in the following circumstances:

Book VIII

✦ Announce when an application requires your attention: In case 
you have your Dock hidden from view, it’s not always clear when an 
application needs your attention. In these instances, Mac OS X grabs 
your attention via speech.
 
✦ Read a selection of text when you press a particular key: If you have 
a child who’s learning to read, the Mac can help him or her by reading 
a selection of text. Kids can figure out how to drag and select text often 
more quickly than they can read that text.
 
✦ Announce the time: Are you like me, constantly getting lost in time 
while immersed in your work? (Not to mention your favorite game.) 
I’ve set my MacBook Pro to announce the hour, which always keeps my 
time sense firmly planted.
The Date & Time pane
There you are, deep in concentration as you finish up the final chapter of 
your Great American Novel, when you glance at the clock in the Finder 
menu bar and realize that you were supposed to pick up your kids at soccer 
practice a full hour ago!
You can avoid this shameful lapse of parental responsibility by turning on 
Snow Leopard’s automatic spoken time feature, which is controlled from the 
Date & Time pane within System Preferences (and is much more effective 
than a mechanical cuckoo clock). But why go to all the trouble of clicking 
Show All when you can just click the Open Date & Time Preferences button 
on the Text to Speech pane? Snow Leopard immediately switches to display 
the Date & Time pane. You can even click the Clock on the Finder menu bar 
and click Open Date & Time. (Again, it’s all about the convenience when it 
comes to the geniuses at Apple.)
From the Date & Time pane, click the Clock tab and select the Announce the 
Time check box to enable your Mac to speak the time; then use the Period 
pop-up menu to choose spoken time at the quarter, half, or full hour. You 
can also customize the voice for spoken time as well.
After you’re done, zip back to the Speech pane by clicking the Back button at 
the top-left corner of the System Preferences window.
Configuring VoiceOver within 
the Universal Access pane
With Snow Leopard’s VoiceOver utility, your Mac can provide you with 
all sorts of verbal feedback, creating a spoken English interface with Snow 
Leopard — a valuable addition to the operating system for the physically 
impaired. The feedback includes

Your Mac Talks Back!
 
✦ Announcing when certain keys are pressed: Snow Leopard can tell you 
when a modifier key (such as Control, Option, or Ô) is pressed or when 
the Caps Lock key is pressed.
 
✦ Announcing cursor movements: You hear an audible alert when your 
mouse cursor switches between windows or when you’ve clicked a 
menu.
 
✦ Announcing the position of the VoiceOver cursor: VoiceOver can 
audibly identify all operating system controls (such as buttons, sliders, 
and list boxes) by using a special on-screen cursor.
 
✦ Reading documents, Web pages, and Mail messages: VoiceOver can 
read aloud the contents of all sorts of documents and application 
windows.
 
✦ Speaking the characters you type: You can set VoiceOver to speak 
every character or each word you type.
Here is how to enable VoiceOver (or to launch the VoiceOver utility, as 
shown in Figure 3-5):

Speaking text through applications
Although VoiceOver provides a comprehensive text-to-speech interface 
for Mac OS X, it might be more than you need. If you simply want to hear 
text spoken within your applications, a number of alternative methods are 
included in Snow Leopard that don’t require VoiceOver.
One of the simplest ways to hear spoken text in Mac OS X is by using the 
TextEdit application. TextEdit is a simple text processor that accompanies 
every copy of Mac OS X. Besides its handy word processing features, 
TextEdit can also speak text. This is good for reviewing a document after 
you’ve written it by listening to it. To hear spoken text with TextEdit, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Launch TextEdit from the Applications folder.
 
 To open the Applications folder, choose Go➪Applications from the 
Finder. In the window that appears, double-click the TextEdit application.
 
 This launches the TextEdit application and opens a new document.
 
2. Enter some text.
 
 Either type some text on the keyboard or paste some into the document 
from the Clipboard. Here’s an example:
Billy Gates has lots of cash
Lots of cash
Lots of cash
Billy Gates has lots of cash
I’d like $10 please!
 
3. Choose Edit➪Speech➪Start Speaking.
 
 Your Mac begins speaking the text from the document. The speech 
engine has some intelligence, so you can enter dollar amounts (such as 
$25,423.12) or Roman numerals (such as Chapter XIV), and the speech 
engine reads them back in plain English. The result of these two strings 
would be “twenty-five thousand, four-hundred twenty-three dollars, and 
twelve cents” and “chapter fourteen.”
 
4. Choose Edit➪Speech➪Stop Speaking.
 
 You Mac stops speaking. It also stops speaking when it reaches the end 
of the text.

688
Your Mac Talks Back!
Speaking text through services
You can also speak text within most applications by using the Services 
menu, located under the application’s named menu. To speak text from an 
application, first select that text. Then, choose Application➪Services➪Spee
ch➪Start Speaking to speak text from many applications (where Application 
is the name of the currently running application). If you don’t want to use 
VoiceOver, this works great for doing things like
 
✦ Speaking a Web page aloud
 
✦ Reading your e-mail
 
✦ Listening to a speech you’ve written in Pages
As you might expect, choosing Application➪Services➪Speech➪Stop 
Speaking ceases the banter emanating from your Mac’s speaker.
 
Alas, not all applications are created equal. Some applications can’t access 
the Services offered in the Services menu. If you don’t see Speech in the list 
of services, you’re out of luck. 

Chapter 4: Hosting a Web Site 
with Mac OS X
In This Chapter
✓ Creating your own Web site

✓ Hosting your own Web server
✓ Sharing files with FTP
I
n a little more than a decade, surfing the Internet has gone from a nerd’s 
hobby to a fun activity enjoyed by the whole family. For children and 
grandparents alike, Web surfing has become one of the world’s most 
popular spectator sports — and at some point, you’ll probably get the itch 
to become more involved. Everyone else has a Web site, so why not you?
Creating and hosting your own Web site can be a rewarding experience, 
and with some help from Apple and Mac OS X, it’s a cinch to do. I devote 
Book III, Chapter 7 to iWeb, the Web page–creation application that’s part of 
iLife, but that’s not the only way to get your message on the Web! Whether 
you want to share your favorite eggplant recipes, display pictures of your 
aubergine Auburn, or just post a purple résumé, Mac OS X has you covered 
in more ways than one.
So put on your seat belts — you’re now entering a strange world of servers, 
mysterious codes, and things that go bump in the Net. No need for alarm, 
though . . . Apple has made the topic so simple that even a politician can do it.
Building a Site with MobileMe
To get you up and running on the Web quickly, Apple offers a suite of online 
Web-publishing tools. The toolbox, collectively known as MobileMe, gives 
you easy and fast access to a variety of Internet functions, including e-mail 
and your iDisk online storage — and you also get a dedicated Web page, 
which you can create with iWeb. A MobileMe membership costs $99.95 
per year direct from Apple, although you can save a significant amount of 
money by buying your membership from online retailers such as Amazon.com.

690
Building a Site with MobileMe
I should introduce everyone around the table here: iDisk is a space on the 
Apple servers designated just for you, where iWeb stores the elements of 
your site when you add or change Web pages.
Registering as a MobileMe user
You can visit Apple’s home on the Internet to register as a MobileMe user:
www.me.com
To register for your free 60-day trial, you must create a username and 
password. The username that you select is an important part of the 
MobileMe experience, so choose it carefully. Your username plays a part in 
your e-mail address, your Web address, your login name, and even the bar 
code on your forehead. (Okay, the bar code is a joke — for now, anyway — 
but the rest aren’t.) Take a few minutes to carefully plan your MobileMe 
username. Your username saves you some typing, is easier for your friends 
to remember, and (like a customized license plate for your car) can convey a 
certain personality to others on the Web.
Creating a Web page manually on MobileMe
For those folks who like driving a car without knowing what goes on under 
the hood, the combination of iWeb and MobileMe is perfect: You just use it 
to create and post Web pages without knowing what makes it all work. On 
the other hand, some folks are born mechanics and like to get under the 
hood. If you’re itching to see what goes on behind the scenes, Apple gives 
you a chance to get your hands dirty. Of course, you don’t have to use iWeb 
to work on your Web site. If you’re well versed in HTML, you can edit your 
Web page files on your iDisk just as you would any file on your hard drive.
You aren’t limited to iDisk access via iWeb: Simply choose the iDisk menu 
from the Finder’s Go menu to mount your iDisk. (No need for a saddle — I 
explain more about mounting volumes in Book I.) When you mount an iDisk, 
it shows up as an icon on your Desktop, just as you might see when you 
insert a CD into your Mac. The icon for your iDisk, however, looks like a 
purple hard drive.
Within your iDisk, open the Sites folder to see the various files that compose 
your Web page. If you’re an old pro at HTML, you can add your own pages to 
your iDisk with your favorite text editor. In other words, the iDisk acts much 
the same as any other disk that you’re accustomed to using. (For all the 
inside information on iDisk, see Chapter 4 of Book V.)
Moving stuff is easy: With your iDisk mounted, double-click its icon to view 
its contents. If you need an image for your Web page, stick it in the Pictures 
folder. If you need a movie for your Web page, copy it to the Movies folder. 
Your HTML pages themselves go into the Sites folder.

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
With MobileMe, Apple takes care of the Web server for you, but you aren’t 
limited to just iWeb and MobileMe: You have other options when it comes 
to posting Web pages. Mac OS X comes stocked with its own high-powered 
Web server, so you can run things without MobileMe. Consider the advantages, 
won’t you?
 
✦ Privacy: Everyone in the house wants access to the family phone book. 
You want all computers on your home network — but not the whole 
world — to see the telephone list. Posting the list on the home network 
keeps it secure from prying eyes outside your home.
 
✦ Your own domain: Want a name like www.size14feetphotos.com? 
(Don’t even think about it; I’ve already taken it.) Anyway, if you run your 
own Web server, you can arrange for your own domain name.
 
✦ Speed: Your friend needs a copy of your iMovie masterpiece for a 
class project. Rather than wait for you to post the file to your iDisk, he 
decides to download it directly from your computer.
 
✦ Coolness factor: It’s fun, it’s easy, and your mother will truly be proud. 
Seriously, it’s fun and easy to run your own Web server. (And although 
your mother might not actually give a hoot, companies appreciate 
employees who know useful skills; therefore, Web server stuff is good to 
know.)
I love Apache: Confessions of a UNIX Webmaster
Deep in the guts of Mac OS X lies one of the most popular Web servers 
around: Apache, which turns your Macintosh into a full-featured Web server. 
The Apache Web server is well known around the world and comprises 
about half of all personal and commercial Web servers in use today. Yes, 
that’s right! You have one of the world’s most-used Web servers installed 
already on your Mac!
Apache’s first appealing feature is its price — absolutely free. Free is 
sassy! Free isn’t any good without quality, though. Fortunately, Apache is 
extremely reliable — and combined with the crash-proof Mac OS X, you can 
be almost certain that your Web server is always available. Besides being 
rock-solid and free, Apache sports all the features you’d expect from a 
top-notch Web server, such as techno-wizard integration with databases 
and scripting languages. Believe me, it can serve anything you throw at it.
Configuring and running Apache
In addition to all its great qualities, Apache is dead simple to operate in Mac 
OS X. Open System Preferences and click the Sharing icon; then select the 
check box next to Web Sharing to launch Apache. That’s it! It doesn’t get any 
easier . . . at least, when it comes to turning on Apache. (See Figure 4-1.)

692
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
 
Figure 4-1: 
Turning on 
Apache is a 
cinch.
 
To begin using your Web server, open a Finder window and navigate to 
the Sites folder that resides in your Home folder; this is the root of your 
personal space on the Web server. Any files that you add to this folder are 
accessible via your Web server.
 
You might find a file named index.html installed already in the Sites folder. 
This is the default file for your Web site. To view it, open your favorite Web 
browser and load this URL, replacing ~username with the username that 
you’re currently using:
http://127.0.0.1/~username/
The 127.0.0.1 address is a generic Internet Protocol (IP) address, which 
means self. (In other words, your Mac is connecting to itself. Faintly unsettling, 
but absolutely legal.) You can also use your real IP address, which appears 
at the bottom of the Sharing panel in the System Preferences when you turn 
on Web Sharing.
 
To see the Web page from another computer, you must use the real IP 
address. The 127.0.0.1 address is merely a convenience for when you’re 
using the actual machine that runs the Web server.
Because Mac OS X is a multiuser environment, each user can host a Web 
site. The key is the username found at the end of the URL; replace it with the 
appropriate username and you’re ready to go. If everything goes smoothly, 
you should be viewing the default Mac OS X Web page, as shown in Figure 4-2. 
The default page displays a welcome message and some important information 
for Web-sharing beginners. Make sure that you read the information carefully.

Figure 4-2: 
Replace this 
default Web 
page with 
something 
more 
interesting.
 
In addition to a main page for any individual who logs in, the Web server 
also has a global default page. To find the global default page, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Open a new Finder window.
 
2. Double-click the drive that contains your Mac OS X installation.
 
3. Choose Library➪WebServer➪Documents.
Here you find dozens of HTML files. These files are the default global home 
pages for many different languages. For English versions of the Mac OS, this 
means that the file named index.html.en serves as the default home page 
for the server. To view this file in your browser, try this URL:
http://127.0.0.1/
Serving static information
To change the default Web page, simply open it in iWeb . . . or use your 
favorite HTML editor and start editing. An HTML editor is an application 
that lets you lay out your Web page with ease. If you’re familiar with a word 

694
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
processor, you’re well on your way to using an HTML editor. Of the many 
HTML editors available, VersionTracker (www.versiontracker.com) gives 
you a good head start on finding some of the most popular ones.
You aren’t limited only to HTML editors, of course. Many word processors 
support HTML export — I particularly like Microsoft Word — so it’s trés easy 
to create Web pages with them by simply choosing File➪Save As.
If you already know HTML (Webmasters might say, “If you can bang out 
raw HTML code”), you can edit your Web pages by hand. Open the existing 
index.html file with a text editor, such as TextEdit or BBEdit (www.
barebones.com), by choosing File➪Open, and change the code to suit 
your needs. For example, a simple Web page might read like this:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!
</body>
</html>
Plain-old HTML pages are handy for displaying the same information 
repeatedly. Computer Web-wizards call this type of information static. 
(That is, it doesn’t change. It’s like a fully grown Chia Pet: You can set it 
once and forget about it.)
Serving information dynamically
Although static displays are good for things like your copy of the Magna 
Carta or sports stats from the past 20 years, they’re not so great for data 
that changes a lot (usually referred to as dynamic, in case you hadn’t 
guessed already). Some good examples of dynamic information are the date, 
the time, your age, andthe weather. If you were to display your age on a Web 
page by using only HTML, you’d have to change it only once every year. 
This isn’t so bad, but consider what happens if you want to post the date on 
a Web page: Now you have to update the Web page once per day. Add the 
time, and now you’re down to HTML changes every hour, minute, or second, 
depending on how reliable you want to make the clock. Clearly, you need 
something besides static HTML for dynamic information.
The Apache Web server allows you to use a variety of tools to produce 
dynamic Web pages. The most basic tool for serving dynamic data is the 
Server Side Include. The Web server executes a small piece of code in your 
HTML; then the Web server replaces that code with some text and sends the 
page to whomever requested it. The result is dynamic text in your Web page.

Book VIII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web Site 
with Mac OS X
695
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
Adding Server Side Includes requires that you perform a few preparatory 
steps beforehand. To alter Apache settings, you must change text in its 
settings file. The file is named httpd.conf and is located here:
/etc/apache2/httpd.conf 
You probably can’t find this file if you go searching for it in the Finder 
because it’s a hidden file. Some text editors, such as BBEdit, can open 
hidden files, but you might not have that editor on hand. You do have the 
Terminal application, though. Launch the Terminal by double-clicking its 
icon. (You can find it in the Utility folder that resides in your Applications 
folder.) Book VIII, Chapter 1 has more information about the Terminal in 
case you need a refresher. At the prompt that appears, enter this command:
sudo pico /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
You are then nudged to provide a password at the following prompt:
Password:
When prompted for a password, use an administrator account password on 
your machine. If you’re the only user, this might be the password of the user 
you’re currently signed in as. Press Return and you’re looking at the innards 
of the Apache setup file. There’s a lot of what I call Programmer Pig Latin 
in this file, but don’t be discouraged. Scroll down through the file (use the 
arcane UNIX Control+V key sequence) and look for this chunk of text:
# Note that “MultiViews” must be named *explicitly* --- “Options All”
# doesn’t give it to you.
# 
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews 
If you don’t feel like scrolling through a bunch of text, you can jump to the 
text by pressing Control+W (shorthand for where), entering the text that 
you want to find (for example: Options Indexes FollowSymLinks), and then 
pressing Return.
Whenever you find the desired text in the file, add the word Includes to the 
end of the last line of this text.
# Note that “MultiViews” must be named *explicitly* --- “Options All”
# doesn’t give it to you.
# 
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews Includes

696
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
Notice the many pound (#) characters. A pound character denotes a 
comment: Think of comments as notes to yourself that help you remember 
what the heck you were doing at this point in the file. Techno-wizard coders 
would say it this way: When a comment character (#) precedes a line, that 
line of text performs no function. You can use this to your advantage to turn 
settings on and off for the server. Add a pound character to the beginning 
of a line, and that function stops working. Remove the character, and the 
function works again. Continue scrolling through the httpd.conf file by 
using the arrow keys or the Control+W search trick, looking for the following:
    # To use server-parsed HTML files
    #
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
Make sure that no # characters precede the AddType and AddHandler 
lines. After you finish, press Control+O, press Return to save the file, and 
then press Control+X to exit the pico text editor. After you finish editing 
Apache’s settings, you have to restart it for the changes to take effect. Open 
the System Preferences and click the Internet tab. Deactivate Web Sharing 
and then reactivate it again.
Open your favorite text editor and add some text to a new file:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!<br>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” -->
</body>
</html>
The <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --> part is a Server Side Include. The 
server understands the “DATE_LOCAL” message, and in its place, adds text 
that displays today’s date. Save the text file and give it the name index.
shtml.
 
Make sure that you include the .shtml extension. It’s important for making 
the Server Side Includes work properly.
Save the file in your global Web folder, located here:
/Library/WebServer/documents/index.shtml

Book VIII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web Site 
with Mac OS X
697
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
Finally, it’s time to check out your handiwork and rest your fingers from all 
this typing. Open a Web browser and navigate to the URL of your global Web 
folder:
http://127.0.0.1/index.shtml
The result should be a Web page that displays today’s date. (I know, it’s not 
exactly material for the Louvre at this point, but I think you can appreciate 
the possibilities.)
If you’re not content with appending .shtml to your files to take advantage 
of Server Side Includes, you need to perform another step. When you view 
your Web site with a Web browser, it’s customary to use default pages for a 
particular directory. For example, when loading the following URL
http://127.0.0.1/
the server looks for a default page to load on the server because you didn’t 
specify one. This is normally a file named index.html, which causes 
problems for Server Side Includes because they require a filename ending 
with .shtml. The easiest way to fix this is to tell the server that index.
shtml can also be a default page. To fix this discrepancy, reload the Apache 
configuration file by using this command line:
sudo pico /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
If you perform this step within 15 minutes of your last sudo command, you 
don’t have to reenter a password. If it’s been longer, you might have to 
enter the password. (As I tell you in Chapter 1 of this minibook, UNIX has 
sophisticated security.) Then scroll down through the httpd.conf file and 
find this bit of text:
# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file or files to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Separate multiple entries with spaces.
#    
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
    DirectoryIndex index.html
</IfModule>
Change it by adding index.shtml to it:
# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file or files to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Separate multiple entries with spaces.
#    
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
    DirectoryIndex index.shtml index.html
</IfModule>

698
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
Notice that index.shtml precedes index.html. This line indicates which 
filenames you can use for the default filename of any folder on the Web 
server. In this case, I’m forcing index.shtml as the default filename before 
index.html. This means that when you load a Web page from your server 
without specifying a specific file, Apache looks for a file named index.
shtml in that folder first. If it can’t find one, it looks for a file named index.
html. With that change in place, press Control+O to write the file to disk 
and then press Control+X to quit the pico text editor. To see your work in 
action, stop and restart Personal Web Sharing on the Sharing pane in System 
Preferences; then load this URL with your Web browser:
http://127.0.0.1/
The result should be that your index.shtml page loads with Server Side 
Includes intact.
Server Side Includes can perform a few other simple functions besides the 
date, including
 
✦ DATE_GMT: Today’s date in Greenwich Mean Time
 
✦ DATE_LOCAL: Today’s date in your local time zone (You’re already an 
expert with this one.)
 
✦ DOCUMENT_NAME: The name of the document
 
✦ LAST_MODIFIED: The date when this document was last modified
To see them all in action, alter your index.shtml file to read like this:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site! <br><br>
GMT date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_GMT” --> <br>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --><br>
Name of this document: <!--#echo var=”DOCUMENT_NAME” --><br>
Last Modified: <!--#echo var=”LAST_MODIFIED” --><br>
</body>
</html>
Reload your Web server’s main page to see the results.
Fancier dynamic stuff
Another common use of Server Side Includes gives you a chance to remove 
whole chunks of your HTML files and put them into another file. (Sounds 
messy, doesn’t it?) You might want to do this for HTML that appears on each 
page of your Web site: For example, you might like for today’s date and the 
page’s last modified date to appear at the bottom of any page of your whole 
Web site. Webmasters, being the sedentary, nerd-beast crowd that they are, 

Book VIII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web Site 
with Mac OS X
699
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
don’t want to type this information repeatedly for each HTML page that they 
create. Furthermore, they don’t want to have to retype all that information 
for every file if it should change. What’s a lazy techno-wizard to do? Server 
Side Includes come to the rescue!
The first step is to modify your main page: in this case, index.shtml:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!<br>
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
</body>
</html>
You might notice that I removed all the Server Side Includes from before and 
added a new one. The new line
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
tells the Web server to load the file named footer.shtml and dump its 
contents into index.shtml in place of this Server Side Include. Save this 
file.
Create a new text file. To the new file, add this code:
<center>
<hr width=”50%”>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --><br>
Last Modified: <!--#echo var=”LAST_MODIFIED” --><br><br>
</center>
If you’re familiar with HTML, the first thing that might strike you is that this 
file doesn’t follow proper HTML formatting. Because this file is just a chunk 
of HTML that’s going to be part of a fully formed HTML file, it doesn’t need 
the full treatment. Otherwise, this code is standard HTML with a few Server 
Side Includes tossed in for good measure. Just to spruce things up a bit, the 
text is centered with a small horizontal line above it. Save this file, giving it 
the name footer.shtml.
Now, whenever you want this footer to be at the bottom of any Web page 
on the server, add the <!--#include virtual=˝footer.shtml”--> 
line from before. Besides saving you time from reconstructing the footer 
each time in an HTML file, you have to add only one line of code, and Server 
Side Includes take care of the rest. Even better, you can alter the footer file 
whenever you want, and the changes appear in the HTML of every page that 
contains the footer.

When bad things happen to good Webmasters
If you’ve browsed the Web for any time at all, you’ve no doubt stumbled 
across a dead link. This phenomenon occurs when you attempt to load a 
Web page that no longer exists on a particular server. If you were lucky and 
the server still existed, you probably saw a boring error message telling you 
that the page no longer exists. Apache provides default error messages like 
this for you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t improve the messages that your 
visitors see. A true power user eschews defaults when creativity kicks in!
Open your httpd.conf file for editing with pico as before.
sudo pico /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
Scroll through the file until you find the ErrorDocument directives.

#ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
#  to redirect to local URL /missing.html
Whenever a server can’t find a page, it produces a 404 error — also well 
known as “That Blankety-Blank Screen” to Web surfers around the world. 
(Please excuse my clarity there.) In fact, the number 404 has entered popular 
slang, meaning dead or broken. Normally, Apache directs itself to a default 
error message, but by removing one comment (note the now-absent pound 
character at the beginning of the second line), you can specify which file you 
want to display (in the form of a page for the viewer) in the case of a 404 
error.
#    2) local redirects
ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
#  to redirect to local URL /missing.html
Press Control+O to save the httpd.conf file and then press Control+X 
to exit pico. Now whenever someone comes across a missing Web page 
on your site, your server redirects him to a file named missing.html. Of 
course, you also need to create this missing.html file. Use your favorite 
text editor to create a new HTML file. To your file, add this code:
<html>
<head><title>Uh-oh!</title></head>
<body>
Holy Toledo! <br><br>
We can’t find the page you requested. <br>
Would you like to <a href=”index.shtml”>return to the main page</a>?
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
</body>
</html>

Book VIII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web Site 
with Mac OS X
701
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
Save this file, giving it the name missing.html. Save it in your Web server’s 
root directory.
/Library/WebServer/Documents/missing.html
Return to the System Preferences Sharing pane, click the Internet tab, and 
toggle Web Sharing off and on again. This forces your Web server to read in 
the changes to the httpd.conf file.
To test it, load a URL that you know doesn’t exist. Anything will do.
http://1270.0.0.1/some_missing_page_I_forgot_to_add.html
If you’ve configured things properly, you see a personalized Web error page. 
This way, perhaps your visitor will chuckle instead of curse when a dead link 
is encountered.
