This one’s for Angie, la luz de mi vida.
Author’s Acknowledgments
No book makes it into a bookstore solely by the efforts of its author. So many
other people are involved in the process — from the first contact with the
Acquisitions Editor to the time when a bookstore employee cuts open the
box and stocks the shelves with your freshly printed title — that it would
probably take a whole other book just to list their names.
I would like to particularly thank my literary agent, Bob Diforio, without
whose tireless devotion this book might never have seen the light of day. My
editors at Wiley are among the best I have ever worked with. From the first
day, their input has made this book better than I could have done it without
their help. My acquisitions editor Steve Hayes, project editor Chris Morris,
copy editor Teresa Artman, and technical editor Paul Wolfe all deserve hearty
thanks for their invaluable assistance in getting this book from the basic idea
through print and onto the shelves.

Introduction
W
ant to stroll down the Champs Elysees in Paris? Feel like taking a per-
sonal look at the Great Wall of China? Or perhaps you’d like to explore
the island of Tahiti on your lunch break? Thanks to Google Earth, you can.
With Google Earth, you can forget the Frequent Flyer miles. All you have to
do is plop down in front of your monitor to see the world up close the easy
way. No lousy airline food, no baggage claim, no customs line — just plain fun!
And I’m not just talking about some plain old maps here. Google has gone to
the trouble to bring you the latest in high-tech GIS (Geographical Information
Systems) — and has done it right. Although the program can easily compete
with most of the high-end GIS software around today, Google Earth isn’t just
for the cognoscenti: It’s for the masses.
About This Book
Yes, there is such a thing as love at first sight. I fell in love with Google Earth
about 30 seconds after I installed it. I found but one thing lacking. As several
other Google Earth users once lamented, there was no such thing as Google
Earth For Dummies.
Well, now there is. This is the book that I wish I had had on my desk during
my early explorations with this fabulous program. It’s designed from the
ground up to provide you with all that you need to know to get the most from
Google Earth from the very start.
In this book, you’ll see not just how to spin a digital globe on your screen but
also how to dig into all the wonderful features that Google Earth has to offer.
That means that you can find — in a single resource — everything from how
to search for pizza parlors to understanding how latitude and longitude work.

How to Use This Book
Put it on top of your desk. Keep it there. That’ll save you a bunch of walking
to the bookshelf. Trust me — after you start playing (or working) with Google
Earth, you’ll want to do more. And more. And more.
If you use this book the way a typical reader does, you’ll want to hit the Table
of Contents and the index to find whatever it is you want to know about. But
this isn’t just a reference book. It’s designed to show you how to get the most
enjoyment and practical use out of the program, and it’s chock-full of exam-
ples that (trust me) will enhance your Google Earth experience, so feel free to
just flip from place to place and see what you find.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume that you have at least some vague idea that the world is composed
of a lot of oceans and a bunch of land masses. Other than this simple begin-
ning, you need no special geographic knowledge — Google Earth will take
care of the rest for you.
Beyond that, this book assumes that you know at least the basics of how to
operate your computer. For example, if I tell you that you need to make a
menu selection, I assume that you know that a menu is that list of words at
the top of the screen, like File, Edit, and so forth, and that you know how to
move your mouse pointer over those words and click them to reveal further
options. If not, you might first want to check out a copy of Windows XP Just
the Steps For Dummies or Windows Vista Just the Steps For Dummies (Wiley),
both by Nancy Muir. If you don’t have Google Earth loaded yet, not to worry:
See how in Chapter 1.
Conventions Used in This Book
A lot of folks have labored for many years to make the For Dummies series as
user-friendly as possible, and we’re all as thankful as can be that they’ve
done that. (I’ve authored several For Dummies books, but I don’t just write
them — I rely on them, too, just like you do.)
When you find a listing that says to choose something like File➪Save from the
menu, that means to first click the word File on the menu and then choose
2
Google Earth For Dummies 

Save from the resultant drop-down menu. (If you’re running Windows Vista,
File has been replaced by the Office Button, at the top left of the window.)
Code listings, which you’ll find in the chapter on KML (the native language of
Google Earth’s files), look like this:
<Placemark>
<name>
...
</name>
<description>
...
</description>
</Placemark>
The ellipsis (...) shows that further information needs to be supplied.
When I need to show how to do that, I use an italic placeholder, like in this
example:
<name>
Name goes here.
</name>
When you see those words in italics (and they should always be obvious in
any event), simply replace the placeholder with your own text, perhaps
something like this:
<name>
Grandpa’s farm
</name>
Whenever you see the URL for one of the top sites you can use to enhance
your Google Earth experience, it appears in a special typeface within the
paragraph, like this: www.dummies.com. Or it might appear on a separate
line, like this:
www.dummies.com
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts, each of which has various chapters in it.
Each of the chapters is further subdivided into logical segments that cover
various activities that you will probably want to pursue to increase your
knowledge of Google Earth. Here’s an overview.
3
Introduction

Part I: Getting to Know Google Earth
Part I introduces you to how the Google Earth program works and how you
can use its search and location features to find just about anything in the
world. It then goes on to explore the program’s basic visual features as well
as its most exciting tools, like Tilt and Zoom.
Part II: Personalizing Google Earth
This part covers how to modify Google Earth’s options and modify the pro-
gram’s screen display to suit you. This part also digs into how to use the
built-in layers, which show where everything from school districts to hospi-
tals is located. Then it goes on to deal with placemarks, which are the Google
Earth geographical equivalent to Web browser bookmarks.
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist
Part III shows how to jump into the world of satellite tourism, looking at
routes from one place to another from a bird’s-eye viewpoint. It then goes on
to show you how to participate in the Google Earth Community, which is the
huge group of fellow users who are there to share and help.
Part IV: Advanced Features 
Well, you knew it couldn’t all be simple. Google Earth does have some more
complex features, and this part explains how they work and how you can tap
into them for your own uses.
These four chapters delve into how you can import external data — ranging
from image overlays to the output from your GPS device — into Google Earth.
You can also read here how to use the companion program Google SketchUp
to add custom 3-D models to your world. Finally, see how to get under the
hood and understand the basics of KML — the markup language that is at the
heart of Google Earth.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V tosses in 30 extra little items that will make your Google Earth experi-
ence into all that it can be. From sources for external map images to Web
sites that can give you all the location info you could ever want to a few other
programs you’ll want to install, this is the icing on the cake.

Google Earth For Dummies 

Part VI: Appendixes
Part VI includes a glossary of the technical terms that you might need to look
up, along with details on just what is included in the Layers pane and a guide
to a bunch of interesting places you’ll want to visit.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll find several special graphics (icons) in the margins of various chapters.
Each of these is there for a reason, so you need to keep watch for them.
Hey, just between you and me, here’s the best way to handle this situation.
Watch your step, or things could get very ugly.
Just in case anybody reading this wants the egghead’s view, here it is.
These note something special to keep in mind.
Where to Go from Here
I advise you to dive in and explore! That’s the operative word for Google
Earth, of course, but it’s also the best way to take this book. Dig into every-
thing, flip through the chapters, stop at some random location, and then just
do whatever you find there. You’ll be glad you did, as every part of the book
introduces you to some new and wonderful feature of Google Earth.

hapter 1 gives you a general overview of the program
and its uses, and Chapter 2 shows you how to quickly

oogle Earth is not just another map program or some kind of digitized
globe inside your computer, but rather, a social phenomenon. Although
it can stand on its own with other Geographic Information System (GIS) soft-
ware, its focus is on giving the public a unique experience.
With everything from National Geographic articles to live Webcams to local
commentaries built into it, the program doesn’t just display maps and photos
but launches the era of satellite tourism. Calling it a 3-D interface to the
planet, the folks at Google are backing it to the hilt with both their incredible
wealth and their enviable marketing savvy, and it seems destined to grow
into one of the largest of all the online communities.
With Google Earth, you have wings. You can fly high above the planet or
zoom right down to the ground. In seconds, you can zip from the deserts of
the American West to the tropic isle Tahiti. No tickets to buy, no bags to pack,
no long lines or customs or anything else. Just go!
The View from Google Earth
Because Google relies upon many outside providers for its satellite and 
aerial imagery, the quality of images in different locations varies somewhat.
Figure 1-1 shows the program’s clean interface design as well as the kind of
detail it can achieve. This close shot of New York’s Yankee Stadium is typical
of the world’s major metropolitan areas.

The same level of detail is not, of course, generally available in rural areas,
which have not been as extensively photographed from space. This is not a
limitation of Google Earth but rather of the current state of available data,
and this constraint applies to all GIS programs. The simple rule is that the
more expensive the real estate, the more likely it is to have been the subject
of detailed — and costly — satellite analysis.
Although it relies upon imagery from satellite photos taken anytime in the
past three years, Google Earth isn’t merely a static collection of warmed-over
satellite images from dusty sources. Rather, it’s continuously kept current
through a vigorous program of updates. Such attention to detail and timeli-
ness is one of the reasons why people ranging from casual users to real
estate professionals have come to rely upon the Google Earth service.
Google Earth also makes it a point to respond quickly to breaking news. As an
example, when a deadly earthquake struck Pakistan, Google Earth had
updated, higher-quality satellite imagery of the quake area available online in
Figure 1-1:

less than a week, freely available to everybody from news junkies to interna-
tional rescue workers. The first time such on-the-fly updating was used was
during the Hurricane Katrina response. Google Earth, working with the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), had very
detailed imagery of the entire affected region online within five days after the
event.
Exploring the Earth Online
The images in Google Earth are composed of zillions of separate pho-
tographs. Most were taken from orbit by satellites or the Space Shuttle, but
there are also much more detailed close shots taken from airplanes.
Each of these images is a tile, and these tiles are laid together side by side to
form a mosaic of the entire planet. In most cases, the tiles are seamless, but
in some places, the structure is a bit more obvious because the tiles come
from different sources and have varying appearances. Figure 1-2 shows an
example of one of these areas with varying tiles.
It’s nice to just buzz around the planet, seeing whatever there is to see.
Sometimes, though, you need to get really specific, and the Search portion of
Google Earth provides you with a tremendous helping hand.
You can enter an address and go right to it, or you can specify a particular set
of longitude/latitude coordinates. You can find monuments, famous locations,
cities, and just about anything else you can think of by just typing in the
appropriate name. Want a look at the Eiffel Tower of Paris, France? Just tell
Google Earth, as I did in Figure 1-3, and it’ll take you right there. Even the
names of major buildings are in the Google Earth location database.
Life isn’t all about geography and satellite tourism, though. Sometimes you’ve
just got to do simple, practical things — and once again, Google Earth comes
through for you. You can do everything from hunting down the nearest
Computer City to mapping out the locations of the seafood restaurants in
your town. In Figure 1-4, you can see the results of my hunting for seafood
restaurants in Honolulu.
You can even give Google Earth two locations and have it plan the best way
for you to drive between them.

Google Earth Gives You Options
For the most part, sophisticated GIS software has always been out of reach of
the public. It’s generally very costly, and it isn’t easy to use. In fact, you gen-
erally needed a Masters Degree in GIS to begin to comprehend how to work
with it. Until Google Earth, that is.
However, Google Earth isn’t a toy, either. It has three levels, each a bit more
powerful than the last. The free version is simply called Google Earth; the
mid-level one is Google Earth Plus; and the high-end, professional level is, of
course, Google Earth Pro.
The cost of Google Earth Plus is a measly $20 a year, and Google Earth Pro
goes for $495 a year.
If you’re going to use the program for commercial purposes, the license
agreement requires you to pop for the Pro version.

Chapter 1: The Earth According to Google

Starting with what’s free
You get an astonishingly powerful piece of software for free with Google
Earth. It’s not some pathetic little wimp of a program that doesn’t do much of
anything; it’s actually everything that the average person could need — and
then some.
Not only do you get the program itself for zero bucks, but you get the data for
free, too. This is perhaps the most incredible deal you will ever see because
the cost of the satellite and aerial imagery alone would bankrupt the average
citizen.
And you can spend all the time you want checking out every square inch of
the Earth without ever buying one photo. You never have to learn what SRTM
means or deal with the technicalities of geocoding or anything like that. Just
fire up Google Earth, and you’re ready to rock and roll.
The slick and intuitive interface lets you easily view whatever you want in var-
ious combinations of angles and altitudes. Zoom in and out and spin things
around all you want; it’s amazing what you can discover when you do that.
The Layers feature of Google Earth is one of its most impressive features.
Layers are extra bits of information above and beyond the mere pictures —
things like the locations of public parks or the incidence of earthquakes in an
area. Other layers give you crime and population information for various
locales or even let you step out of Google Earth and see through live
Webcams, like the one in Figure 1-5.

As if all this weren’t enough, another freebie — the companion program,
Google SketchUp (see Figure 1-6) — lets you make your own 3-D models and
add them to Google Earth. Go ahead and design your dream house; then drop
it right onto your vacant lot in the real world. You can read more about
SketchUp in Chapters 11 and 12.
Looking at Plus and Pro versions
You can stick with the free version to do most things you’d like. However,
upgrading has some advantages. With the Plus version, you get a few extras,
like the Hurricane Katrina databases from ImageAmerica and NOAA, as
shown in Figure 1-7.

Chapter 1: The Earth According to Google

You also get the ability to import several extra kinds of data (see Chapter 9)
including image files and the output from your GPS (Global Positioning
System) device. However, in my opinion, the best reason to go for Google
Earth Plus is its greater speed and higher printing resolution. It’s important
to note here that this isn’t a higher screen resolution — all versions of Google
Earth share the same main database — but it can make a difference if you
need to make hard copies.
The Pro version, as you might expect, is even faster and adds the ability to
perform more sophisticated measurements such as area calculations. A few
add-on modules at this level enable you to do things, such as print extremely
high-resolution images or add traffic count information. You also get person-
alized tech support with Google Earth Pro.
So What Can I Really 
Do with Google Earth?
Google Earth is a tool and, just as with any other tool, you can use it for 
lots of things. Whether you’re just playing around for the sheer fun of it or
you desperately need it to perform your professional tasks, it’ll take the 
challenge.
Of course, right off the bat, it’s one of the best pieces of educational software
out there, and it will doubtless quickly become a trusted part of every
teacher’s toolset, but it has so much more to offer as well.
Plenty of personal uses
I don’t think I’ve seen too many homes that didn’t have an atlas and a globe,
and it’s getting hard to imagine one that doesn’t have Google Earth. The pro-
gram has everything the old style approach does and adds so much more to
boot.
The next time you’re thinking of moving, fire up Google Earth and check 
out the boundaries of school districts, the location of fire stations, and all 
the other things that might help you choose your new neighborhood (see
Figure 1-8). While you’re at it, have Google Earth figure out the best route to
your job from there.

Tired of watching the news and having only a vague idea of where something
is happening? Now you can see for yourself. You can fly from China to
Antarctica to Africa and back in seconds.
And businesses might want to . . .
Businesses of almost every kind can benefit from Google Earth, whether
they’re already using GIS technology or not. These are just a few of the uses
to which it’s already being put:
 Law firms can use it to investigate any location involved in a criminal or
civil action.
 Civil planners can research traffic patterns.
 Real estate agents have a powerful sales and marketing tool in Google
Earth, enabling them to pitch the virtues of any location.
 TV stations now have their own instant source of satellite images to 
supplement their newscasters’ reports.
Don’t forget, either, that the learning curve for Google Earth is a lot less steep
than other GIS software. This means less time lost when training employees.

Joining the Google Earth Community
Professional GIS users, such as real estate developers, environmental engi-
neers, law firms, and the like, aren’t the only folks who find this program a
wonderful tool, nor is it just a great new way to teach geography and history.
Google Earth draws its users from a broad segment of the general population
as well.
Many of the users of the program participate in an official community that
keeps in close touch with one another, sharing both technical tips and inter-
esting finds. The quest for unusual items is one of the high points of using
Google Earth (see Figure 1-9). Hundreds of thousands of people are in the
Google Earth Community’s membership, which is growing fast, with thou-
sands more signing up every week.
Of course, you don’t have to register and participate in the official forums.
There’s also an ever-growing number of other user-supported sites that offer
help and information as well as companionship.

Getting Geekier with GPS, 
KML, and Overlays
If you want to get into some of the more advanced things about Google 
Earth, no problem. It can interface with a GPS device, which is a global posi-
tioning system that uses signals from satellites in orbit to determine your 
latitude, longitude, and (depending on how sophisticated it is) altitude 
(see Figure 1-10).
As long as I’m going alphabetical, allow me to throw in KML. It’s the language
that Google Earth uses, and it’s a lot like HTML. If you have any kind of expe-
rience creating even simple Web pages, you can go under the hood of Google
Earth and really make it sing by controlling every little detail of its display.
And maybe you want to dress things up a bit with some outside data. Go
ahead and pop in an overlay, which is an image that you add on top of the
basic data in Google Earth. Figure 1-11 shows an 1827 map of Regent’s Park in
London on top of the satellite shot of the modern city.

Downloading the Program
Before you can experience any of these wonderful things, you have to get
your hands on Google Earth, of course. Fortunately, Google makes this an
easy and painless task:
1. Open your Web browser and go to http://earth.google.com
(see Figure 1-12).
2. Click the Get Google Earth link on the upper-right side.
3. On the resulting Web page, as shown in Figure 1-13, select the check
box if you want to subscribe to the Google Earth newsletter.
4. Select the appropriate radio button for the version of Google Earth for
your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
5. Click the Download Google Earth button.
This takes you to the Web page shown in Figure 1-14, and the download
should start automatically. If you are using Windows, the download
might fail to start. Either click the yellow information bar at the top of

A Note for Mac and Linux Users
Google Earth’s three versions are as close as a very skilled group of program-
mers can make them. In fact, the Windows commands are the same as the
ones for Linux. For example, Alt+F opens the File menu in both systems.
There is, however, no equivalent Mac key combination. For key combinations
that use the Ctrl key in Windows or Linux, just use the corresponding Mac
command (Ô) key instead.

T
he world’s a very big place, of course, and you don’t always know where
everything is. When you’ve got the whole planet tucked inside your com-
puter, though, Google Earth is there to lend a hand, helping you find what-
ever you’re looking for.
Make that three hands, actually. You can use the Fly To tab to zip from place
to place in many ways — by address, latitude and longitude, city names, or
ZIP codes, to name a few. The Find Businesses tab (as shown in Figure 2-1)
allows you to quickly track down various kinds of establishments like stores
or restaurants. Finally, the Directions tab helps you map a route from one
place to another.
The best way to quickly familiarize yourself with the various ways Google
Earth has of finding things is to play with them. Click the three tabs in the
Search pane — Fly To, Find Businesses, and Directions — and note the exam-
ples shown. Now, do it again. And again. Each time, you see a different possi-
bility (until the built-in samples start to repeat, of course — there are limits
to this sort of thing).
Figure 2-1:
Check out
the example

first.

Flying Down to Rio (Or Anywhere Else)
The Fly To tab has the greatest variety of possible ways to enter your search
terms. Say you want to get a look at Tokyo; just type in the name of the city.
Of course, sometimes you’ll find more than one place with the same name.
For example, if you type Washington, you’ll end up looking at the northwest-
ern United States state and not the capital city, so be as specific as you can.
You might, for instance, add a ZIP code. Of course, if you have an exact
address, so much the better. Examples are shown in Table 2-1.

Now that you know what you can enter, here’s how to do it:
1. Enter the search term in the text box (see Figure 2-2).
2. Press Enter or click the Begin Search button.
Google Earth flies you to the location.
3. If the search term isn’t recognizable by Google Earth, you get a pop-
up error message (see Figure 2-3). Click OK and try another one.

4. To redo an earlier search, click the down arrow at the right of the text
box to access a drop-down list, as shown in Figure 2-4. If necessary,
scroll down to find the one you want, and then click it.
Right on the dot: Understanding 
latitude and longitude
Latitude and longitude enable you to pinpoint the location of any place on
Earth. As shown in Figure 2-5, lines of latitude show how far north or south
you are from the equator, and lines of longitude show how far east or west you
are from the prime meridian (an arbitrary north-south line drawn through
Greenwich, England). Thus, latitudes to the north are larger and larger posi-
tive numbers, whereas the ones to the south are progressively larger negative
numbers. When you see a positive latitude, you automatically know that it is
north of the equator (and, conversely) that a negative latitude is south of it.
The higher the number, the farther away from the equator the location is.
The same system also holds true with longitudes except that the negative
numbers are to the west (left) of the prime meridian and the positive numbers
are to the east (right) of it. No land is found where the two meet: The equator
and the prime meridian cross in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa.

25
Chapter 2: Finding Businesses, Places, and Things

The two commonly used ways to specify latitude and longitude are
 Sexagesimal degrees: This older system, still in use today, is also one
that you will often find in historical records. It uses three measures:
degrees, minutes, and seconds.
 Decimal degrees: This modern system makes the minutes and seconds
into a decimal fraction of a degree.
Okay, take a deep breath and bear with me. Look at a spot in Tahiti, located at
latitude 17°31'25.00"S. This is 17 degrees, 31 minutes, and 25 seconds south of
the equator. The same spot is expressed more neatly in decimal degrees as
–17.523611°. The sexagesimal version uses S at the end to specify south of
the equator, and the decimal version uses a minus sign at the beginning.
To turn the Latitude/Longitude Grid on and off, use either the menu option
View➪Grid or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+L.
When you zoom in on a location (see Chapter 3), the lines of latitude and 
longitude become more precise, as shown in Figure 2-6.
Figure 2-5:
The
Latitude/
Longitude
Grid shows
exact
coordinates.
26
Part I: Getting to Know Google Earth 

To set how latitude and longitude are displayed, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options from the menu.
2. Click the 3D View tab.
3. The Show Lat/Long panel has three radio buttons, as shown in Figure
2-7. Select the first one to use the Degrees, Minutes, Seconds method.
Select the second one to select decimal Degrees instead, or the third
to choose Universal Transverse Mercator.
The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system is not
actually a method of specifying latitude and longitude but one which
specifies a predetermined zone of the Earth’s surface.
4. Click OK to finish.
This changes both the display in the status bar at the bottom of the
screen and the figures on the grid.
Regardless of which way you have the display set, you can still enter either
type of latitude/longitude figures in the Search pane. However, you cannot
mix and match. If the latitude is in decimal format, the longitude has to be the
same.

Chapter 2: Finding Businesses, Places, and Things

Deciphering geocoding
Geocoding is a fancy word for matching latitude and longitude with a spot on a
computerized map. (See the earlier section, “Right on the dot: Understanding
latitude and longitude.”) When you enter a location (either by address/inter-
section or exact latitude and longitude), Google Earth has to look up those
coordinates to find out what image to show on your computer screen.
Latitude and longitude have been fairly well determined for most places in
the civilized parts of the world. Even within cities, however, there’s an extra
wrinkle involved with using street addresses. You see, people don’t build
houses, office buildings, hospitals, and so forth according to a worldwide
grid. Instead, they’re largely built wherever nature left enough flat space to
put them or where TNT and bulldozers can make a large enough flat area.
Nonetheless, most larger towns and cities are built according to some sort of
plan today, even if they started out as a freeform cluster of farms way back
when and just sort of grew into a municipality. How closely the “on-paper”
version of city planning matches the reality you find when you walk or drive
around the land varies widely from place to place, however.
On top of this, a standard lot size doesn’t exist. Two homes side by side can
take up very different amounts of space on the map. If one is on a ten-acre lot
and the other is on a half-acre lot, they just aren’t the same. Computer maps,
however, know nothing of this kind of detail. Instead of knowing for sure
where an address is, they make an educated guess.
Figure 2-7:
Set the
latitude/
longitude
display
method.
28
Part I: Getting to Know Google Earth 

The method used is interpolation, which is a fancy word meaning that you
estimate an unknown value that falls between two known values. Say, for
example, that you know something is more than a yard long but less than two
yards long. You know that its length has to be around four or five feet.
It’s the same with addresses in Google Earth. Say you have an ideally designed
city, well laid out with a standardized address system. Each street is numbered
sequentially from 1 to 100, north to south, and each avenue is numbered in the
same manner from west to east. Thus, a building with an address of 100 Fifth
Avenue would be on the corner of 1st Street and 5th Avenue, and one with an
address of 200 Fifth Avenue would be at the intersection of 2nd Street and 5th
Avenue. It logically follows that 150 Fifth Avenue would be right smack in the
middle of that block.
However, it might not be there in reality. For example, take three structures
along the shore of Lake Erie in Cleveland, Ohio. The Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame’s address is 751 Erieside Avenue. To its west, at 601 Erieside Avenue, is
the Great Lakes Science Center. One more block west, and you’re at Cleveland
Browns Stadium, located around the corner at 1085 W. 3rd Street.
As you can see in Figure 2-8, the official locations in Google Earth are a mixed
bag. As you might expect with address interpolation, only two of the three
street addresses (marked by gray squares) fall on the exact spot. Of the built-
in placemarks, only the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is perfectly accurate.
Gray squares
Figure 2-8:
The Rock
and Roll Hall
of Fame in

Ohio.
29
Chapter 2: Finding Businesses, Places, and Things

Thus, although Google Earth shows the stadium’s and the Great Lakes
Science Center’s addresses correctly, the Science Center’s location is shown
where the stadium actually lies, and the stadium’s placemark (as opposed to
its address) is found to the south of the actual structure.
This sort of thing isn’t the fault of Google Earth — the same thing happens in
any similar program because of the current state of geographic data.
This means that you sometimes have to do a bit of looking around after you
get to where you’re supposed to be. If necessary, zoom out and scroll around
a bit. If you know the area, look for identifiable landmarks, major intersec-
tions, and the like in order to get your bearings. If you don’t, you might need
to compare a map with the satellite image in order to figure out exactly
what’s where.
Searching for a Tailor in Tulsa: 
The Find Businesses Tab
Strictly speaking, the Find Businesses tab isn’t really about just businesses.
You can use it to find anything from museums and colleges to libraries and
hospitals. This tab uses a very straightforward approach. Here’s how to get
the most out of it:
1. Enter the type of business in the What text box (see Figure 2-9).
2. Enter the location in the Where text box.
If you don’t enter a location here, Google Earth defaults to Current View.
It assumes, in this case, that you’re already looking at the area you want
to search in.
3. Press Enter or click the Begin Search button.
Like with the Fly To search, Google Earth displays the location. This
time, though, it includes icons marking the location of each business of
the specified type. The Search pane also generates a linked list, as you
can see in Figure 2-10.

Getting Directions
When you need to figure out how to get from point A to point B, it’s time to
do that thing that wives always complain that their husbands never do — ask
for directions.
Guys, nobody but you will know you did it.
To find out how to get from here to there, click the Directions tab and then do
the following:
1. Enter the starting point in the From text box (see Figure 2-11).
This can be anything from a street address to a city name.
2. Enter the end point in the To text box.
3. Press Enter or click the Begin Search button.

Chapter 2: Finding Businesses, Places, and Things

Google Earth displays the area between the two points along with a
series of icons marking each turn you need to take along the way. The
waypoints are also shown as links in the Search pane.
A waypoint is a marking of a specific location on a map. Typically, these
are specified by citing the latitude and longitude — and, in most cases,
altitude as well.
4. Click the icons or the links to get more information in a pop-up bal-
loon (see Figure 2-12).
Whenever you see a pop-up info balloon in Google Earth, it has two links for
Directions. If you click the To Here link, that location is automatically entered
into the To text box in the Search pane; if you click the From Here link
instead, that info goes right into the From text box.
Going Global: The Overview Map
Unless you’re a geography teacher or an explorer, you’ll probably get con-
fused as to exactly where you are from time to time in Google Earth. To solve
this little problem, the program includes an Overview Map feature that keeps
you up to date on how your current location relates to the rest of the world
(see Figure 2-13).
Figure 2-12:

You turn it on and off by choosing View➪Overview Map from the menu or
using the Ctrl+M keyboard combination.
In addition to showing you where you are, the Overview Map also gives you
another quick way to move about. Just double-click within it, and you’re
flying to the point you chose.
You can change both the screen size of the Overview Map and the amount of
detail it shows. Here’s how:
1. Choose Tools➪Options from the menu.
2. Click the 3D View tab.
3. To change the amount of space the Overview Map takes up onscreen,
move the Map Size slider (see Figure 2-14).
Moving it to the right enlarges it; moving it to the left shrinks it.
4. To change the level of detail, move the Zoom Relation slider.
Taking it all the way to the left means that the Overview Map shows the
same view as the viewing area does (1:1). Taking it all the way to the
right (1:Infinity) means that the whole world is shown in the Overview
Map regardless of how much you zoom into the viewing area. Figure 2-15
illustrates the two extremes.
5. To finish up, click OK.

Surfing with the Integrated Web Browser
The built-in Web browser comes in mighty handy when you need to check
something out. For example, you might want to go to some of the places
listed in Chapter 15 to copy some latitude and longitude figures so that you
can paste them into the Search pane without having to switch back and forth
between Google Earth and your external browser.
The home page in the integrated browser is (you guessed it) the Google
search page, so you can be off and running right away. To display it, choose
Tools➪Web from the menu. If you want to turn it off later, use the same menu
option. By default, it shows up at the bottom, as shown in Figure 2-16, but it
can also be moved to the side if you prefer (see Figure 2-17) by clicking its

oogle Earth is a lot of fun to use, and a good part of the reason for that
is the careful design that went into its interface. It’s slick, intuitive, and
easy to use. Even when you’re using it for serious work, it still feels like
you’re playing a game.
In this chapter, I take you on a tour of the various ways to modify, measure,
and emphasize what you’re looking at. I’ll show you how to “spin the globe”
that’s inside Google Earth and the different ways you can choose to zoom in
and out or tilt and spin the landscape.
Rock the World: Dragging 
and Zooming the Map
No matter what your tastes may be, Google Earth has some way of moving
things around that’ll make you happy. Of the several methods for doing the
same things, you can pick and choose the ones you like best. The two major
approaches to navigation are using your mouse as a kind of virtual hand or
using it to click the navigation controls. The controls are covered in the upcom-
ing section, “Gaining a New Perspective: The Direction and Tilt Controls.”
Time to get started with a simple first exploration:
1. Place your mouse pointer on the globe in the viewing area.
2. Press and hold the left mouse button.
3. Move the mouse in any direction.
The globe follows, allowing you to turn it at will.

4. Move the mouse sharply and quickly release the button.
The globe continues to move in that direction. To stop it, just click it.
5. Double-click the globe.
The image begins to zoom in, as if you were descending.
6. Click the globe to stop it.
7. Double-click the right mouse button.
The image zooms out.
8. Click either mouse button to stop it.
9. Turn your mouse’s wheel forward and backward.
Forward moves the world away from you (as you gain altitude); 
backward moves it toward you.
If you don’t like how the mouse wheel zooms, you can switch its direction.
Here’s how:
1. Choose Tools➪Options from the menu.
2. Click the Navigation tab.
3. Select the Invert Mouse Wheel Zoom Direction check box, as shown in
Figure 3-1.
4. Click OK.

* The speed of this sharp movement sets the speed of the continuous scrolling or zooming that

Gaining a New Perspective: 
The Direction and Tilt Controls
At first glance, the navigation controls can be a bit daunting, but they are
quick to learn and easy to use (see Figure 3-2). There are two sliders and a
ring. Inside the ring are a few other directional controls.
41
Chapter 3: Adjusting Your View on the World

The horizontal slider is the tilt control. Moving it to the right tilts the scene,
and going to the left returns to an overhead view. If you don’t feel like using
the slider, just double-click the boxes on the ends of the slider. The right one
tilts the image all the way, and the left one straightens it up again. A single
click on the boxes tilts or untilts just a little bit.
The vertical slider is the zoom control. Moving it up zooms in; moving it
down zooms out. Like with the other slider, it has control boxes on its ends
as well. A single click on the top one zooms in a small amount and then stops;
the bottom one does the same while zooming out. Double-clicking them
causes the zoom to continue until you click the viewing area to stop it.
The ring is the rotation control. To use it, click it and hold the mouse button
down. Now, move the mouse. Both the ring and the image will rotate.
After you start rotating things, you don’t have to keep the mouse pointer on
the rotation ring. You can move it anywhere, and the effect will be the same
until you release the button.
At the top of the rotation ring is the capital letter N. Of course, this stands for
North, but in the process of rotation, North can end up pointing to just about
anywhere onscreen. To restore it to its traditional position at the top of the
screen, just double-click the N.
The four arrowheads within the rotation ring are directional movement con-
trols. A single click of any of them moves the scene in the opposite direction
(or moves your viewpoint in the indicated direction — it’s all relative).
Double-clicking results in continuous movement; to stop it, just click.
There are, of course, plenty of times when you want to do more than just go
left and right, up and down. For those times, the starburst-shaped control in
the center works like a joystick. Click it, hold down the mouse button, and
then drag it around. You can move in any direction. As with the arrowheads,
it is your viewpoint that moves in the direction you pull the control.
Figure 3-2:
The
navigation
controls.
42
Part I: Getting to Know Google Earth 

The navigation controls only appear when you move your mouse pointer
over their screen area (the upper-right corner). To change this behavior,
choose View➪Show Navigation from the menu. The three options are
Automatically (the default), Always, and Never.
Three-dimensional viewing
If you’ve been using the tilt controls, you might not notice much of a differ-
ence in the tilted and untilted views unless you have the Terrain feature
turned on. Look at your Layers pane and make sure that there’s a check mark
in the Terrain check box. Then fly on over to some nice mountainous area
like the one in Figure 3-3 and tilt things again.
One of the drawbacks to Google Earth (or any satellite view, for that matter)
is that you are looking at things from an unfamiliar perspective. Even when
looking at your own house or apartment building, the view lacks the “normal”
orientation, in which we view things from the ground and buildings rise
above the plane of our vision.

43
Chapter 3: Adjusting Your View on the World

When you use the tilt controls with the Terrain layer activated, the buildings
are still flat images as seen from space.
For the larger cities, Google Earth has an answer: The major buildings have
been added as three-dimensional models in a layer of their own. Figure 3-4
shows Manhattan without and with the 3D Buildings layer activated.
The compass and status bar
The compass is the circle in the upper-right corner, with the N at the top. If
you’d rather not have it onscreen, choose View➪Compass from the menu.
Turning off the compass does not turn off the navigation controls. They will
still appear as usual.
The status bar is the line of information at the bottom of the screen that pro-
vides the
 Latitude, longitude, and elevation of your mouse pointer
 Percentage of the image that has so far flowed into your computer
 Altitude of your viewpoint
To gain a little more screen area, choose View➪Status Bar from the menu.
Figure 3-5 shows Google Earth with all possible distractions removed from
the viewing area.

The Bigger They Are: Figuring Sizes 
with the Scale and Ruler
You have two ways to measure things in Google Earth: the Scale Legend and
the Ruler. The Ruler is the more versatile of the two, but the Scale Legend
requires no action beyond turning it on.
Using the Scale Legend
Normal maps have a scale printed on them that shows you, for instance, that
100 miles in the real world equals 1 inch on the map. Google Earth has one,
too, and it constantly keeps track of the changes in the scale as you zoom in
and out (see Figure 3-6). To turn it on (or off), choose View➪Scale Legend
from the menu.
Using the Ruler
The Ruler can measure either a line or a path that you draw onscreen. A path,
in this case, is a series of connected lines.
Figure 3-5:
Clear the
viewing
area.
45
Chapter 3: Adjusting Your View on the World

Lines
To measure the distance between two points, you need to use the Line
option. Here’s how:
1. Click the Show Ruler button on the toolbar (the vertical ruler icon).
2. In the Ruler dialog box that appears (as shown in Figure 3-7), click the
Line tab.
3. Click the start point in the viewing area and then click the end point.
A line appears between them with the distance displayed in the Ruler
dialog box.
4. To change the unit of measurement, click the Length drop-down list
(see Figure 3-8).
You can choose anything from centimeters to nautical miles to smoots.
5. To erase the line, click the Clear button.
Figure 3-7:
Working
with lines.
Scale Legend
Figure 3-6:
The Scale
Legend.
46
Part I: Getting to Know Google Earth 

You can also just start to draw another line. The first one disappears
when you do.
If the Mouse Navigation check box is selected, holding down the mouse
button and moving the mouse moves the image as usual. If you deselect it,
that same mouse movement simply draws a line while the world stands
still. This setting affects the mouse only when you’re using the Ruler.
Paths
Paths work much the same way as lines do. The exceptions are that in Step 2
of the preceding step list, you click the Path tab and essentially repeat Step 3
several times. To draw a path, you click the starting point, click an intermedi-
ate point, click another intermediate point, and so on, defining the waypoints
along the path until you finally reach the end point.
As you add new segments to the path, the length of the total path is shown in
the Ruler dialog box (see Figure 3-9).
Paths and lines are separate things. Although you can have only one line
drawn at a time, you can have both a line and a path onscreen together (see
Figure 3-10). Although beginning a new line will delete the old one, the path
remains unaffected while you do so.

ment

Chapter 3: Adjusting Your View on the World
Miles and meters and smoots. Oh, my!
If you take a careful look at Figure 3-8, you’ll see
the usual standards of measurement that you’re
likely at least vaguely familiar with. You know,
miles and kilometers, feet and yards, that sort of
thing. So what about that last entry? Smoots?
What?
You can’t blame yourself if you don’t know how
many smoots tall you are or how many meters
there are in a smoot. Really. The whole thing
started about 50 years ago with a group of
young students from MIT as a fraternity prank.
One of the students — Oliver R. Smoot, Jr. —
was 5'7" (1.702 meters) tall. He was flipped end
over end across Harvard Bridge, keeping count
just as you might with a yardstick. When the
other side was reached, it was scientifically
determined that the bridge was slightly more
than 364 smoots long.

In this part . . .
C
hapter 4 shows you how to modify Google Earth’s
options (such as whether to use meters or feet for
measurements) and how to modify the program’s screen
display to suit yourself.
Chapter 5 digs into one of the program’s most powerful
features — layers — which comprise a series of built-in
data points that show the locations of everything from
borders and volcanos to ATMs and Italian restaurants. 
By selecting various combinations of them, you can 
customize your own map.
Chapter 6 goes on to show how you can add your own
data points called placemarks — which are to Google
Earth what bookmarks are to a Web browser — as well as
how to placemark any spot on the planet along with your
own notes about it.

G
oogle Earth works just fine right out of the box, but its creators under-
stand that a lot of us like to monkey with things and customize them
just how we like it. You can do lots of things to make Google Earth your own.
For example, if you need a bigger Layers pane and don’t use the Search pane
much, resize them to suit yourself. Want a better look at the big picture? Just
go full-screen and admire the view.
Also in this chapter, I show you how to get the most out of your video set-
tings and how to manipulate the elevation of mountains. From measurement
options to font choices to language options, this chapter’s got you covered.
Relieve the Pane: Manipulating 
Screen Areas
In Figure 4-1, you can see the main Google Earth window. In the standard con-
figuration, the menu bar and toolbar appear at the top of the window, the
sidebar is on the left, and the Viewing pane takes up the rest of the screen.
The toolbar holds eight buttons:
 Show/Hide Sidebar: Toggles the sidebar on and off. This gives more
screen space to the Viewing pane when you’re not using any of the side-
bar features.
 Add Placemark: Adds a new placemark (see Chapter 6).
 Add Polygon: Adds a new polygon (see Chapter 13).
 Add Path: Adds a new path (see Chapter 3).

 Add Image Overlay: Adds a new image overlay (see Chapter 9).
 Show Ruler: Shows the Ruler, which enables you to measure the dis-
tance between points in the Viewing pane (see Chapter 3).
 Email: Uses your e-mail program to send either a placemark to, or an
image of, the view on your screen.
 Print: Prints the image and, optionally, other details. Which options you
get when you click this button depends upon the last thing you did:
• Driving Directions: You just used the Directions tab in the Search
pane. The default is to print the driving directions, but you can
select 3D View instead (see Figure 4-2).
Figure 4-2:
Printing
Driving
Directions.
Figure 4-1:

52
Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

• 3D View + Placemark Details: You created a placemark before click-
ing the Print button. 3D View is available (see Figure 4-3).
• 3D View: Prints the image at the selected resolution. Available
printer resolutions depend upon which version of Google Earth
you have and, of course, your printer (see Figure 4-4).
The sidebar contains three smaller panes:
 The Search pane: Covered in detail in Chapter 2, the Search pane is
where you, well, search. Three tabs help you find things:
• Fly To tab: This tab is the most fun, in my opinion. Simply type in
where you want to go, and you immediately “fly” over the Earth’s
surface to your destination.
Figure 4-4:

53
Chapter 4: Fine-Tuning the Program

• Find Businesses tab: Enter the location and kind of business you’re
interested in, and Google Earth shows you where they all are. The
term business should be interpreted loosely because you can also
find things like schools and churches from this tab.
• Directions tab: This tab gives you detailed driving directions
between any two points you enter.
 The Places pane: See Chapter 6 for more on this.
 The Layers pane: See Chapter 5 for details.
All these panes can be manipulated to alter Google Earth’s appearance or to
gain some screen room. For example, you don’t have to accept the default
proportions of the panes. They can be altered with the stroke of a mouse. To
resize a pane, follow these steps:
1. Place your mouse cursor on the dividing bar between two panes. The
cursor changes, as shown in Figure 4-5.
2. Press and hold the left mouse button.
3. Drag the dividing bar to the desired location.
4. Release the left mouse button.
If resizing the panes isn’t enough for you, you can toggle them — turn them
on or off — as well. To do this, click the expand/collapse triangles to the left
of the sidebar pane name (Search, Places, or Layers). When a pane is turned
off, it takes up almost no space onscreen, thus leaving more room for its
neighbors to expand. For example, Figure 4-6 shows that when the Search
pane is toggled off, the Places and Layers panes expand to fill the available
space.
Figure 4-5:
You can
resize

panes.
54
Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

The sidebar can also be toggled off, thus automatically turning off all three of
its panes. When the sidebar is toggled off, the Viewing pane expands to take
up the entire screen except for the menu bar and toolbar at the top (see
Figure 4-7). To do this, you can click the Show/Hide Sidebar icon in the tool-
bar, press Ctrl+Alt+B, or choose Tools➪Sidebar from the menu.
You can switch back and forth between normal view and full-screen mode by
pressing F11. The difference between full-screen mode and turning off the
sidebar is that the full-screen approach covers the Windows taskbar.

Chapter 4: Fine-Tuning the Program

Setting the Options
In addition to monkeying with the screen view, you can go under the hood of
Google Earth to change various options to suit yourself. To get started,
choose Tools➪Options from the menu. The resulting Options window con-
tains five tabs:
 3D View
 Cache
 Touring
 Navigation
 General
I discuss each of these in greater detail in the sections that follow.
The 3D View tab
The 3D View tab, as shown in Figure 4-8, is the first one you see in the
Options window. As you might expect, it offers several choices that affect
how you see things.
Figure 4-7:

viewing
area full-

56
Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

The various areas on this tab are
 Detail Area: The amount of detail that can be shown is dependent upon
your video memory. The more detail you need, the more memory that’s
required. Google Earth solves this problem by providing you with the
option to restrict the size of the detail area, which is always at the
center of the screen.
If you select Small, the area of maximum detail is limited to a square of
256 pixels in width and height at the center of the image; the remainder
of the image is less detailed. The Medium setting is 512 x 512 pixels, and
the Large is 1024 x 1024.
If the amount of memory in your computer system is too small, the
Large option is grayed out (unavailable). Google recommends 32MB of
video RAM as a minimum for the Large setting.
 Texture Colors: This setting depends upon the quality of your video
card. Most computers today have true color (32-bit) cards, but an older
video card might require the lower-quality High Color (16-bit) option.
 Anisotropic Filtering: This is a highfalutin term for softening the harsh
edges along the horizon when you tilt the image onscreen. It’s very
memory intensive, so go for this only if you’ve got 32MB of RAM or
more. (Anisotropic filtering is available only if you’re using the DirectX
graphics mode.)
 Labels/Icon Size: The default size is Medium. For larger or smaller labels
and icons, select the appropriate radio button.
Figure 4-8:
The 3D View
tab offers
general
viewing
options.
57
Chapter 4: Fine-Tuning the Program

 Graphics Mode: When you install Google Earth, it chooses what it thinks
is the best display option for your system, depending upon your graph-
ics card. If you change your card, you might need to change which of the
two major 3-D rendering methods to use.
If you experience problems regardless of which 3-D method your graph-
ics card uses, you have a safety net: Select the Use Safe Mode check box
to make Google Earth use a less complex method of displaying things
that, unfortunately, also produces a lower-quality viewing experience.
 Show Lat/Long: There are two common ways to present measurements
of latitude and longitude. The older method uses the system of degrees,
minutes, and seconds; the newer one simplifies the minutes and seconds
to a decimal value. To set the onscreen display to the decimal version,
select the Degrees radio button. The third option, Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM), isn’t a method of specifying latitude and longitude but
one that specifies a predetermined zone of the Earth’s surface.
This setting affects only how latitude and longitude are shown on your
screen. You can still enter them in the Search pane in either form regard-
less of what you choose here.
 Show Elevation: Much like the previous option, this option simply sets
whether the onscreen display is in the English or the metric system of
linear measurement. To choose the former, select the Feet, Miles radio
button; to choose the latter, select the Meters, Kilometers radio button
instead.
 Fonts: If you want to change the lettering that Google Earth uses, follow
these steps:
a. Click the Primary 3D Font button.
b. In the resulting dialog box (as shown in Figure 4-9), click the name of
the font style that you want (under Font). If necessary, scroll down to
locate the name.
Figure 4-9:
Change
your display
font here.
58
Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

c. Select the font style by selecting Normal, Italic, Bold, or Bold Italic.
Some font styles might not be available, depending upon the par-
ticular font chosen.
d. To set the font size, either type in a number in the text box under Size
or click the size you want. Scroll down if necessary to locate the
desired value.
e. (Optional) If you want the letters to appear with strikethrough or as
underlined, select the Strikeout or Underline check box, respectively.
f. (Optional) If you want a different alphabet than the default Latin,
click the down arrow under Script and select the desired one.
g. Click OK.
The Secondary 3D Font button sets a backup font. This is used 
if a character cannot be shown in the primary font. Choosing a 
secondary font is identical to choosing one for the Primary 3D 
Font setting.
 Terrain Quality: Drag the slider here to set a compromise between
speed and the detail of the terrain. The lower the terrain quality, the
faster it displays; the higher the quality, the slower it displays.
• Elevation Exaggeration: The default setting of 1 means that the 
elevation — the rise and dip of hills, valleys, and so forth — that
you see onscreen is faithfully reproduced. However, sometimes it’s
helpful to change this and make things look higher than they are in
reality. Figure 4-10 shows the same scene with elevation exaggera-
tion set at 1 (left) and at 3 (right). This is a useful technique, for
example, for quickly spotting natural water drainage routes.
Many experienced users will set the Elevation Exaggeration to 1.2
or 1.3. This provides a slightly increased perceived height of moun-
tains and depths of valleys. It helps to create a 3-D illusion from the
flat images without distorting the landscape too greatly.
The top value possible for Elevation Exaggeration is 3.0, and you
can take it all the way down to 0.5.
 Overview Map: To set the size of the Overview Map, ranging from
postage stamp to playing card, drag the Map Size slider to the left for a
smaller Overview Map or to the right for a larger one.
The Zoom Relation setting specifies how much of the Earth is shown in
the Overview Map. For the whole thing, leave the slider at the default
Infinity setting (all the way to the right). To zoom in on a smaller area,
move the slider to the left.
For details on using the Overview Map, see Chapter 2.

Chapter 4: Fine-Tuning the Program

The Cache tab
To get the best performance out of Geographic Information System (GIS) pro-
grams, video memory isn’t your only concern. The amount of RAM and disk
space on your computer system also matters. These values can be adjusted
on the Cache tab (see Figure 4-11).
The Memory Cache Size setting is for your RAM.
Figure 4-11:
Set the
cache size.
Figure 4-10:
Exaggerate
the
elevation.
60
Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

The Disk Cache Size setting is used to supplement the RAM by setting aside a
certain amount of space on your hard drive to be used as virtual memory.
You can set up to 2000 MB of disk cache, but because disk drives are consid-
erably slower than RAM chips when it comes to memory access, the RAM
size is the more important of the two.
Depending on how much memory you have, you can set higher or lower
values for both types of cache. Google Earth does not let you set values
higher than the amount of memory your computer can sustain.
To erase the current information in either cache, click the Clear Memory
Cache or the Clear Disk Cache button. If you’re logged out of the Google
Earth server (File➪Server Log Out from the menu), you can also click the
Delete Cache File button to not only clear but also erase the disk cache file,
which will be re-created the next time you log on.
Occasionally, the imagery in the cache can become corrupted (bad placemark
values, interrupted downloading, and so on). When this happens, the view
becomes unstable or blurry, or otherwise acts in a peculiar manner. The rec-
ommended fix to this abnormal behavior is to use the Delete Cache File button.
The Touring tab
The Touring tab (see Figure 4-12) handles a wide variety of settings relating
to movements and camera angles. These settings are outlined as follows:
 Fly-To/Tour Settings: The Fly-To settings control how you see things when
you double-click a placemark in the Places pane, such as how quickly the
scenery goes past (see Chapter 2). The Tour settings, on the other hand,
affect only the animation of a series of points (see Chapter 7).
• Fly-To Speed: Use the slider or type in a specific value to set how fast
you fly from place to place. The faster your computer system is as a
whole — that is, if you have a high-speed Internet connection, a fast
microprocessor, lots of RAM, a hot video card, and so forth — the
faster you can make this setting. Otherwise, keep it slow, or you’ll
just be watching a lot of blurry, half-formed images flying past.
• Tour Speed: This works the same as Fly-To Speed but affects only
the playback of tours.
• Tour Pause: This slider controls the amount of time spent waiting
at a stop on a tour. You can set this between 0 and 60 seconds.
• Play Tour: Use the spinner arrows to set how many times to play a
tour in a row. The default is 1, and the top is 9,999.
If you want the tour to loop indefinitely, scroll down from 1 for a
setting of Infinite.

which the scene is shown.
• Camera Range: This setting specifies how far away the camera
(that is, your viewpoint) is from the scene.
• Speed: Slide to the right to step on the gas, and slide to the left to
hit the brakes.
The Navigation tab
The Navigation tab, as shown in Figure 4-13, allows you to control the naviga-
tion mode produced when you use your mouse as well as to customize the
size and content of the Overview Map (see Chapter 2). The settings found
here are as follows:
 Mouse Wheel Settings: The default is medium. To slow things down,
move the slider to the left; to speed them up, move it to the right.
Select the Invert Mouse Wheel Zoom Direction check box if you’d rather
have the Earth move away from you when you roll the mouse wheel
away. Deselect it if you prefer to have the Earth move toward you when
you roll the mouse wheel away.

Adding Layers and Points 
of Interest (POIs)
In This Chapter
 Understanding layers
 Displaying layers
 Exploring the various types of POIs
L
ayers and points of interest (POIs) have a lot in common but also have a
couple of important technical differences. Basically, POIs are places to go
(such as the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, or the Sears Tower) — and all
the placemarks in the Places pane are POIs. Whether they came with Google
Earth or you add them, they exist on your computer.
Layers, on the other hand, exist only on the Google Earth servers. They are
forms of information that are added to the basic view in Google Earth —
things like national boundaries, crime statistics, or the names of local legisla-
tors. Nonetheless, many layers are simply groups of individual locations
(such as hospitals, airports, or golf courses). Thus, to the average user of
Google Earth, the difference between a placemark in the Places pane and a
location that is specified in the Layers pane is often a moot point.
Think of layers as information on a series of transparent sheets. As each
sheet is laid on top of the others beneath it (like during an overhead projec-
tion), a composite picture emerges.
Peeling the Onion: A Guide to Layers
Layers are added pieces of information above and beyond just the satellite
image itself. In fact, everything in Google Earth, except for placemarks, that
isn’t a photo from space is a layer of some kind. From railroads and highways
to airports and eateries, the sheer variety of added layers is what makes
Google Earth more than just another peek through an orbiting satellite’s lens.

Built-in points of interest
You activate layers by selecting the check boxes next to them in the Layers
pane. Depending upon which layer you activate, the resulting display on your
screen might change in various ways. For example, if you turn on the
Volcanoes layer while looking at Atlanta, Georgia, nothing changes — no 
volcanoes exist there. Try the same thing in Latin America or the Pacific,
however, and your screen is filled with volcano icons, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Likewise, if you select the Populated Places layer, your view of Europe is 
covered with names (see Figure 5-2); on the other hand, viewing this same
layer while looking at North Africa results in a practically bare screen 
(see Figure 5-3).
Items on the Populated Places layer won’t show up on your screen unless
your viewing altitude is lower than 2,500 miles (about 4,000 kilometers). The
lower you go, the more of them you see.

Chapter 5: Adding Layers and Points of Interest (POIs)

Displaying Layers
The Layers pane, of course, shows all the layers and their sublayers (see
Figure 5-4). Here, you can turn on or off zillions of settings that alter the
volume and type of information included, and thus how things appear on
your screen.
Within the Layers pane, the View drop-down list allows you to choose among
three display settings (see Figure 5-5):
 Core: This setting includes all the layers except for the US Government
layer.
 All Layers: Cleverly named, this setting shows just that.
 Now Enabled: This setting shows only those layers that have either
some or all of their elements selected.
Although the amount of information is nearly overwhelming, showing it is
quite simple. Each layer has a plus sign and a check box next to it. Click the
plus sign to expand the layer, revealing its sublayers. To select all sublayers
at once, just select the check box next to its parent layer. To select any sub-
layer individually, select the check box next to it. Figure 5-6 shows both meth-
ods in action.

From School Districts to Earthquakes:
Types of Layers
Google Earth offers many different layers, and you can expect new ones to be
constantly added. In this section, I show you a sampling of several of the
most interesting ones.
A list of all the layers in Google Earth can be found in Appendix B.
The Google Earth Community layer
The Google Earth Community layer is a hodgepodge composed of a number
of sublayers. Many users of Google Earth participate in the Google Earth
Community forums (see Chapter 8), in which they exchange messages with
one another. Some of those messages include placemarks that automatically
open in Google Earth. The Google Earth Community layer is the same thing
but in reverse order. Instead of the messages linking to the placemarks, the
placemarks link to the messages. Sublayers here include Sports and Hobbies,
Huge and Unique, Nature and Geography, and Travel Information.
To use this layer, follow these steps:
1. Select Google Earth Community in the Layers pane (see Figure 5-7).
This makes the icons in Figure 5-8 appear in the Viewing area.

(see Figure 5-9).

Chapter 5: Adding Layers and Points of Interest (POIs)

3. Click the icon.
This brings up a text balloon, as shown in Figure 5-10.
The contents of that text balloon might be different from those in this
figure, depending upon which icon you chose, but the process is the
same.
4. Click the Click Here for the Post link to read the original message and
any replies in the Google Earth Community forums (see Figure 5-11).
Most of these text balloons also have other links you can follow. For exam-
ple, click the Posted By link for information about the person who posted
the message or a link to an outside Web site for additional information.
The Google Earth Community layer can be a bit overwhelming at first. If you
simply accept it with every possible sublayer selected (checked), the sheer
number of new placemarks that show up onscreen could totally obscure
what you’re looking at (see Figure 5-12). Again, this depends on the location:
New York, for example, has more placemarks than the Gobi desert. 
To prevent information overload, I recommend taking a gander at the sublay-
ers and deselecting any that you’re not interested in.

Chapter 5: Adding Layers and Points of Interest (POIs)

Featured Content
The materials in the Featured Content layer come from outside sources, such
as National Geographic magazine and The Discovery Channel. Although minor
variations exist, many of them share the same process that you use for view-
ing forum messages via the Google Earth Community layer:
1. Click the layer name in the Layers pane.
2. Place your mouse pointer over one of the icons to see its title.
3. Click the icon to bring up the text balloon.
4. Click the links within the text balloon to launch external Web pages.
That’s where things can get really different. After you’re on the Web and away
from Google Earth, there is no standardized user interface to work with.
Some of the linked Web pages are fairly static, while others offer a variety of
resources ranging from 360-degree panoramic images to film clips and image
overlays.
Each external Web site is outside the control of Google Earth and has its own
set of procedures to follow. In some cases, for instance, you might need to
download QuickTime in order to view online movies. Just remember: When
you get there, read the instructions.
National Geographic Magazine layer
When it comes to writing about geography, there’s really only one place you
can turn — National Geographic magazine. This magazine has graced Google
Earth with its own special set of layers, including not only links to articles but
also live Webcam footage and the Africa Megaflyover, a multimedia presenta-
tion of a pilot’s journey from one tip of the continent to the other. Figure 5-13
shows an example of the wealth of information that’s available in this layer.
If you’re not seeing all the Nat Geo stuff, zoom in. Although you can see
things like Feature Articles & Photographs and Sights & Sounds icons from
way out in space, the Africa Megaflyover is visible only from 2,500 miles
(4,000 kilometers) and lower.
UNEP: Atlas of Our Changing Environment layer
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is right up-front sup-
porting Google Earth and its users. This layer, in addition to providing some
interesting information about the ecology, lets you add its image overlays
right into Google Earth.
Figure 5-14 shows the UNEP entry for the Florida Everglades ecological
region. Near the bottom are two links: Overlay Images on Google Earth and
View More Information. The latter is a standard link to another Web site, 
but the Overlay option works within Google Earth to put the images you’re
74

looking at into the Viewing pane (see Figure 5-15). All you have to do is click
on it; the rest is automatic.

Location layers
Several layers can help you find specific locations, ranging from ATMs to
churches. The Shopping and Services layer, for example, shows you the loca-
tions of groceries, video rentals, drugstores, malls, and much more. The
Parks and Recreation Areas layer helps you find everything from the nearest
golf course to a quiet spot to take a break (see Figure 5-16). The Community
Services layer shows you the location of schools, churches, fire stations, and
hospitals, among others.
Boundary layers
Power users will want to check out all the sublayers in the Borders layer. In
addition to national borders, you can set options to show state and county
borders, coastlines, and the names of nations and islands. As you can see in
Figure 5-17, the use of borders can really help you understand exactly what
you’re looking at.

Chapter 5: Adding Layers and Points of Interest (POIs)

Borders, though, aren’t the only kind of boundary line that you can display in
Google Earth. Under the US Government layer, you can also scope out every-
thing from postal boundaries to congressional districts. The Community
Services layer also includes school district boundaries. For a real-world
example of how useful these searching capabilities are, see the upcoming 
section, “Picking a good place to live.”
Geographic/geological layers
A wide variety of geographic and geological layers are available, ranging from
volcanoes and earthquake sites to 3-D terrain effects. Here are two of the
most striking examples.
Terrain layer
The Terrain layer is one of the most critical in Google Earth. Without it, all
you can see of the land is a two-dimensional photograph taken from space.
With the Terrain layer, however, you suddenly have all the three-dimensional
elevation information that has been gathered all over the planet. Mountains
spring to life, and rivers suddenly make more sense as the valleys they run
through are carved into the countryside. See the difference the Terrain layer
makes in Figure 5-18.
Water Bodies layer
Selecting the Geographic Features➪Water Bodies layer adds outline maps of
rivers and lakes to your image. The results can be surprising and show that
you shouldn’t necessarily take the information from just one layer as gospel:
In many places, the mapped location of the water and the location shown on
the satellite image vary greatly, like the view of the upper Amazon River, as
shown in Figure 5-19.
Figure 5-18:
The Terrain
layer turns
the flat
image 
into 3-D.
78
Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

There are several reasons for this discrepancy. First of all, the Water Bodies
layers (all the layers, actually) are only as good as the data that Google Earth
purchases and licenses from various data sources. Like with any other geo-
graphic data, the farther you are from major population centers, the sparser
and chancier it is. The accuracy of the data sources can vary greatly. And
although several mechanisms are in place for users to report data errors, it
takes time for them to reach the source, be corrected, updated, and sent
back to Google Earth. Then, they wait until there is a large enough group of
them to make an update worthwhile. It’s imperfect, but it gets a bit better
every time.
Also, no matter how carefully maps are geocoded and matched to satellite
images, rivers have a way of constantly changing their exact flow. Mark
Twain’s Life on the Mississippi is full of examples of this sort of thing, and the
ever-changing nature of rivers is why river pilots — guides who live on a river
and keep careful track of its metamorphoses — find ready employment with
the captains whose boats travel those rivers.
All it takes is one flood or earthquake to change the course of a river in min-
utes. The course of the Oxus River in Afghanistan was shifted by an earth-
quake in ancient times, and the locations of many historically important
rivers are mysteries today for a variety of reasons, even the famed Rubicon
which Julius Caesar crossed on his way to conquer Rome.
The legend of the Mojave Desert Galleon is another example. It seems a
Spanish ship full of conquistadors sailed from the Gulf of Mexico, followed
the Rio Grande, and then connected with the rest of the western North
American river system. They sailed far north and were never heard from
again. An earthquake at that time changed the course of the river they were
following, and the ship foundered on dry land as the water disappeared
beneath it. Over the centuries, various desert travelers have reported seeing
it as the ever-shifting desert sands parted for a time over its grave, but it
remains lost to this day.

Chapter 5: Adding Layers and Points of Interest (POIs)

Transportation layers
Several layers can help you scope out the facts about transportation,
whether you need superhighways, railroads, or hiking trails. These layers are
as follows:
 Transportation: This layer shows airports, mass transit lines, ferries,
and railroads, and tosses in gas stations to boot. There are no options
for choosing the type of airport in the Airport category, so in some
places, the Transportation layer shows you everything from major inter-
national hubs to the local hospital’s heliport (see Figure 5-20).
 Roads: The sublayers under Roads allow you to make your own road
map based upon your own particular needs. You can select only the
major highways, or you can work your way all the way down to mule
tracks. In addition to the U.S. road system, Canada and Europe are well
covered.
 African Roads: You’ll find the info on African roadways under Featured
Content➪Tracks4Africa➪T4A Roads.
 Hiking Trails: The map of the Great Wide Open is found in the Featured
Content➪US National Parks➪Trails layer.

Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

Picking a good place to live
A good place to live means different things to different people, of course. For
a family with young children, the location of schools might be a priority. For a
private pilot, proximity to a small airport could be what tips the balance.
Those who prefer mass transit need a subway station or the like nearby. The
possibilities are as endless as people are varied, but you can combine the
various layers in Google Earth to make the solution to your individual needs
show up right on your screen.
As I mention earlier, having too many layers open at the same time can slow
the program down, so you will need patience proportional to the number of
layers you’re viewing at once. The faster your computer and your Internet
connection, the better, of course.
Before you get started, give a little thought to what’s most important to you.
Does your ideal location have to be near a golf course? A church? Perhaps
you want to make sure there’s a handy gas station around the corner or that
a mass transit line goes between there and your office. You might want to
consider things like groceries, banks, or particular kinds of restaurants as
well. (Do you really want to drive all the way across town for your favorite
food?)
While you’re at it, consider the things that you don’t want to live next to.
Unless you really like Halloween, for example, you probably wouldn’t choose
to live too close to a cemetery. Other things are two-edged swords. Although
your shopaholic teenager might be thrilled to move in next door to a shop-
ping mall, your elderly parent who wants peace and quiet might have a very
different attitude. The same goes for locations such as fire stations and police
departments; you have to balance the extra safety or convenience versus the
extra noise.
As you think about these things, write them all down so you won’t forget any-
thing. When you’re ready to check your list out in Google Earth, you’ll proba-
bly need to activate several different layers. Here’s a brief guideline of how to
find several things that might be on your list:
 Community Services layer: This layer has many items of interest:
schools and school districts, places of worship, fire stations, and 
hospitals.
 Transportation➪Transit layer: If you need access to mass transit, select
this layer.
81
Chapter 5: Adding Layers and Points of Interest (POIs)

 Boundaries: When it comes to boundaries, you might need to check sev-
eral layers. You can find school district boundaries as mentioned in the
earlier bullet, or get as detailed as the county boundary level by select-
ing the Borders layer. You might also want to scroll down to the US
Government layer and select the US Congressional Districts, Postal Code
Boundaries, and City Boundaries check boxes as well.
 Food: We all need to eat, but we satisfy this need in different ways. For
those who like to dine out formally or chow down on some tender, hot
barbecue ribs, the Dining➪Dining layer (say that five times, fast) is a
must. There, you can choose from sublayers including options such 
as family eateries, pizza parlors, and seafood restaurants (see Fig-
ure 5-21). For those who prefer home cooking, check out the Shopping
and Services➪Grocery Stores layer. If you must grab your food on the
go, the Convenience Stores layer under Shopping and Services might
help, and you’ll probably want to select Transportation➪Gas Stations 
as well.
 Parks and Recreation Areas layer: The outdoor or sports enthusiast
will want to select at least parts of this layer. In addition to traditional
parks, sublayers here include Ski Resorts, Golf, and Sports Venues
(major arenas). You might also want to check out Featured Content➪
US National Parks.
Figure 5-21:
Specifying 
a restaurant
is easy.
82
Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

 US Government layer: This layer has two other sublayers that are of
interest here: Census and Crime Stats. The former provides population
and income reports from the 2000 U.S. Census, and the latter does the
same for 2000 crime statistics (see Figure 5-22).
If both the Census and Crime Stats sublayers are turned on at the same time,
their icons might occupy the same space and thus obscure each other. The
icon on top is the last one selected in the Layers pane, so you can move the
bottom icon to the top simply by clicking its check box twice: once to dese-
lect it, and once to reselect it.
You have to be at a viewing altitude of no more than 40 miles (62 kilometers)
to see the Census and Crime Stats icons.
Figure 5-23 shows a neighborhood with several likely layers selected.
What if the things that are important to you just aren’t to be found in any of
the layers — something exotic like UFO sightings or perhaps something more
mundane like statistics on air and water quality? If you’d like to see a new
layer in Google Earth, sound off about it in the Google Earth Community. If
enough people there seem to like your layer idea, maybe Google will add it.

Speaking of the Google Earth Community, don’t forget to activate that layer
and then look for any of its icons in the area (see the preceding section).
Check out the postings to see whether there’s anything you should know in
them.
Finally, don’t neglect the other tools Google Earth has to offer. Do a search in
the Find Businesses tab to locate all sorts of stores, restaurants, and so forth
in your target area. And don’t forget to use the Directions tab to check out
various routes such as between work and home.

In This Chapter
 Exploring placemarks
 Creating placemarks
 Editing the various attributes of placemarks
 Saving and organizing placemarks
A
placemark is to Google Earth what a bookmark is to a Web browser.
When you see something interesting while you’re wandering the virtual
planet and you want to be able to get back there easily, just slap down a
placemark, and Google Earth remembers the location for you.
Placemarks are used in Google Earth exactly how pushpins are stuck into
physical maps that hang on walls, and that’s why its icon looks like one.
Of course, you’ll probably end up with more than one placemark as you
explore the Earth. And, just like how you probably organize your Web
browser’s bookmarks in various Favorites folders, you can put placemarks 
in their own folders as well. Often, people make simple geographic groupings
of placemarks — African deserts, North American cities, and so on. There
are, however, as many ways to organize Google Earth placemarks as you 
can imagine.
For example, a sports-involved parent might group the locations of area Little
League baseball parks to share with other parents. Or, if you’re sick of paying
those extra fees for using whatever ATM you can find, why not whip up a map
of all the branches of your bank? What if you’re in sales? Laying out the loca-
tions of this week’s upcoming sales calls in Google Earth just might boost your
efficiency and save you a bunch of time and trouble on the road. Figure 6-1
shows some possibilities.

Exploring the Built-in Sightseeing
Placemarks
You don’t have to wait until you’ve explored the world to have a few place-
marks. Google Earth comes with a ready-to-use selection that includes some
great sites like the Eiffel Tower and the Grand Canyon. Here’s what you can
explore. Note: The content is variable, and I expect more to come.
 Google Campus: Google’s Mountain View, California site
 Grand Canyon: Arizona’s famed landmark
 Colorado River View: Another aspect of the Grand Canyon
 Mount Saint Helens: Washington State’s notorious volcano
 Chicago River: Where it meets Lake Michigan
 Manhattan Island: New York’s heart
 Eiffel Tower and Trocadero: A triumph of architecture and the 
gardens of Paris
 Nelson’s Column: London’s homage to England’s naval hero
 Red Square: Moscow’s historic district
 St. Peter’s Basilica: The Vatican City location of Papal ceremonies
 Former Republican Palace: The palace of Saddam Hussein in 
Baghdad, Iraq
 Union Buildings: South Africa’s governmental center
 Forbidden City: Beijing (Peking), China’s palace of the Ming Dynasty
 Olympic Site: Sports complex that hosted the 2000 Summer Olympics 
in Sydney, Australia
 Rashtrapati Bhavan: The palace of the President of India in New Delhi
 Reichstag: Germany’s parliamentary building in Berlin
 Imperial Palace: The home of Japan’s emperor in Tokyo

Some of these Sightseeing placemarks include in the description suggestions
for an enhanced experience, such as enabling the 3D Building layer for a more
impressive skyline or tapping into the vast commentary of the Google Earth
Community for the kind of information you don’t find in the travel books.
To get familiar with your placemarks, follow these steps:
1. In the Places pane, scroll down to Sightseeing (see Figure 6-2).
If necessary, click the plus sign to expand the list of Sightseeing place-
marks so that you can see them. (The plus sign toggles to a minus sign
when the list is expanded.)
If your sidebar is turned off so that you can’t see the Places pane, you
can bring it back by pressing Ctrl+Alt+B.
2. If you can’t read the full description in the Places pane, click the
placemark (don’t double-click).
This opens up a text balloon in which the whole description is shown
(see Figure 6-3).
3. To see a placemark, double-click it.
Google Earth automatically flies you to the placemark. During the flight,
the text balloon shows the description of the location and remains there
after you arrive.
To remove the text balloon from your screen, click anywhere else in the
program after you arrive. Or, you can get proactive and click the X in the
upper-right corner to close it during flight.
You can optionally click the To Here or From Here links (in the text bal-
loon) if you’re looking for travel directions. (See Chapter 7 for more on
touring.) The To Here and From Here links work only with placemarks.

X Marks the Spot: Creating 
and Naming Placemarks
Although the placemarks that come with Google Earth are a great place to
start, you’re bound to end up making some placemarks of your own. Here 
are four ways to create a placemark:
 From the Add menu: Choose Add➪Placemark or Add➪Folder.
 With a key combination: The key combination for a new placemark 
is Ctrl+Shift+P. For a new (placemark) folder, it’s Ctrl+Shift+N.
 The Add Placemark button: Just click this toolbar button, which looks
like a pushpin.
 Places pane entry: Right-click an entry in the Places pane, and then
choose Add➪Placemark or Add➪Folder from the resulting pop-up menu.
Each method takes you to the same place but with minor variations in 
the journey.
Folders are created the same way as placemarks except that there is no
Folder option when you use the toolbar’s Add Placemark button.

Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

Most likely, however, you’ll be doing things the easiest way — adding 
placemarks from the toolbar. You handle that by following these steps:
1. Click the Add Placemark button (the second button from the left — 
it looks like a pushpin) as shown in Figure 6-4.
The placemark goes in the center of the Viewing area, so position your
image accordingly before you add a placemark.
2. In the New Placemark dialog box that opens, enter a name for the
item you’re creating in the Name text box at the top (see Figure 6-5).
The latitude and longitude are already entered for you.
3. In the Description text area, enter any notes you want to make about
the item you’re placemarking.
The first few words of this description appear under the item in the
Places pane. I recommend including some short mention of what the
place is and perhaps a note on why you find it interesting; this can be
very helpful when you find a forgotten placemark later on and wonder
why you made it.

4. If all you want is to quickly create a placemark, give it a name, save it,
and click OK.
Your new placemark or folder appears in the My Places folder in the
Places pane, represented by a pushpin icon (see Figure 6-6).
5. (Optional) On the other hand, if you want to explore all your options,
just leave things here as they are and move on to the next section.
All your placemarks in the My Places folder load whenever you start Google
Earth. The more placemarks you have, the longer it takes to get going. If you
want to disable them all at once, just click the My Places folder at the top of
the Places pane so that it is deselected.
Editing Placemarks
After you add a placemark, you can change anything in it from its name to the
camera angle used to view it:

Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

1. Right-click the placemark, either in the Places pane or its icon in the
Viewing area.
2. Choose Properties from the contextual menu.
The Edit Placemark dialog box appears.
You’re off and running.
The following sections discuss each of the tabs present in the Edit Placemark
dialog box.
The Edit Placemark dialog box is identical to the New Placemark dialog box
described in the preceding section on creating and naming placemarks.
Setting the advanced options for either placemarks or folders is identical, the
only exception being that folders have only the Description and View tabs.
Customizing styles and colors
Beyond the basic creation and naming of a placemark, you have a variety 
of options you can set that affect the placemark’s appearance. The Style,
Color tab (see Figure 6-7) has settings that affect how the placemark displays
on the map. The settings are for the color, size, and opacity of either two or
three items:
 Lines: This option appears only if you choose the Extend to Ground
option on the Altitude tab and put your placemark higher than the
ground. (See the section, “Setting the altitude,” later in this chapter.)
These lines extend from the placemark down to the ground. If you want
the lines, select this option; otherwise, deselect it. 
 Label: This is the name that you gave the placemark when you created it
or when you last edited it.
 Icon: This is the pushpin icon.
Here’s how to set the options for each of these:
1. To set the color for any of these items, click the Color square next to it.
The Select Color dialog box appears. (See Figure 6-8.)
2. Make your color choice by clicking one of the Basic Colors.
If none of these basic colors suits you, you can click in the mixing box to
the right to interactively create a color. You can also specify a color by
manually entering its values in the text boxes below the mixing box. If
you want to use this custom color in the future, click the Add to Custom
Colors button. Then you can select this color any time by just clicking
its square under Custom Colors.
91
Chapter 6: Pinning Down Placemarks

3. Click OK to return to the Style, Color tab.
4. Specify either the width of a line or the scale (both height and width at
once) of the icon or label by either typing the value into the text box or
scrolling the numbers up and down with arrows, as shown in Figure 6-9.
Permissible values range from 0.0 to 4.0.
5. Set opacity (the presence or lack of transparency) in exactly the same
way you set the width/scale, except that the limits fall between 0%
(totally transparent) and 100% (totally opaque).
6. The effects of these changes are immediately visible but aren’t yet cast
in stone. To save them, click OK button; to cancel them, just click Cancel.

Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

Changing the placemark icon
The preceding section shows you how to change the properties of the pushpin
icon, but you can also change the icon itself. Google Earth comes with a pretty
good selection of icons — golf flags, silverware, and airplanes, for example —
but you can go even beyond that and specify your own artwork instead.
There are lots of reasons to use a custom icon instead of the standard push-
pin. You might need to signify different kinds of resources; varying ages of
archaeological sites; or types of roads, bridges, or other infrastructure items.
Maybe you simply want to mark an important intersection with a special sign.
There isn’t anything on the Style, Color tab that will help you do this; instead,
it’s that little button in the upper right of the Edit Placemark dialog box (see
Figure 6-10).
Here’s how to use it:
1. Click the Change Icon button.
This brings up an options box with lots of icons you can choose from
(see Figure 6-11).
2. If one of these icons is to your liking, click it to choose it. Or, click the
word None at the bottom of the icons to have no icon. To use your
own image, click the word Custom instead.
The new icon immediately appears in place of the pushpin in the 
Edit Placemark dialog box as well as in the viewing area, as shown in
Figure 6-12. If you choose None, no image will show in either place.

The new image becomes the default icon instantly. If you want the 
traditional pushpin back, you have to reselect it when you create a 
new placemark.
3. If you chose Custom in the preceding step, you see the dialog box
shown in Figure 6-13. Click Browse to locate your file.
The image file used for a custom icon must be of a standard type: .jpg
(or .jpeg), .bmp, .tif (or .tiff), .tga, .png, or .gif.
4. Navigate to the location of the file (see Figure 6-14), click its name,
and then click Open.
This takes you back to the dialog box shown in Figure 6-13.
5. Click OK to accept the icon file and return to the Edit Placemark
dialog box.
6. Click OK.

Chapter 6: Pinning Down Placemarks

Adjusting the view
In the View tab (see Figure 6-15), you can set from what location, angle, and
altitude you view a given placemark. It is important to distinguish this from
the location and altitude of the placemark itself. The view settings determine
how the placemark is shown in Google Earth.
The first option you run into here is the Center in View check box. When you
select this, how you work with icons in the Viewing area changes. Normally, if
you click and drag an icon, the icon itself moves. With this option selected,
however, the icon remains fixed in the center of the screen while you move
the Earth behind it.
When setting values on the View tab, you can enter the values by hand, but it
is much easier to use the navigation tools to find a viewpoint you like (see
Chapter 3), edit the placemark, and click the Snapshot Current View button.
This automatically changes all the settings to conform to the ones in the
Viewing area. To change back, click the Reset button. Table 6-1 explains the
meaning of each setting:

If you want to create a striking visual display, you can specify the placemark

You might want to pursue a few other options here.
Altitude here is shown in meters regardless of the Elevation measurement

Chapter 6: Pinning Down Placemarks

The altitude can be entered manually into the text box, or it can be set by
using the Ground/Space slider: Ground is 0 meters high, and Space is 800,000
meters high.
The instant you move the slider from Ground, the Clamped to Ground setting
suddenly changes to Relative to Ground. The converse is true as well: If you
move the slider all the way back to the left, the setting reverts to Clamped to
Ground. You can also click this drop-down list to choose a setting of
Absolute. Table 6-2 gives the details of the various choices in this list:
Table 6-2

Clamped to Ground
The default altitude method. The item is on the ground at
whatever elevation ground level occupies. The altitude
setting for this is always 0 (zero) because anything else
would be above the ground.
Relative to Ground
This option places the item above the ground level by the
amount specified in the Altitude setting.
Absolute
This works the same as Relative to Ground except that
the Altitude setting places the item at that height above
sea level rather than ground level.
If you choose either the Relative to Ground or the Absolute altitude setting,
you get another option (which is grayed out if you’re using Clamp to Ground):
Extend to Ground. This is useful when you have a placemark hovering over
some landmark (see Figure 6-17).

The color and width of these lines is set in the Style, Color tab, which I cover
in the earlier section, “Customizing styles and colors.”
Organizing Placemarks
Say you have the Statue of Liberty as a placemark. Maybe you want to put
that placemark in two folders: one for world monuments and another for
American history. Doing so is easy; after you create a placemark or a folder,
you can copy, paste, or cut it just like you’re used to doing with files and 
folders on your hard drive.
In this section, I take a look at how to manage your placemarks after you add
some to your collection.
You can work with placemarks in the Places pane pretty much the same way
you do with files on your hard drive. In other words, you can rename, cut, copy,
paste, delete them, and so forth. You can also save particular placemarks or
even entire folders separately from the main listing.

Chapter 6: Pinning Down Placemarks

Saving files
Everything you place in the My Places folder (which is every placemark you
make, ultimately) is automatically saved in one big file that loads every time
you start Google Earth. There are times — like when you want to share some
placemarks with a friend — when you’ll want to save just a placemark, or per-
haps a folder full of placemarks, as a separate file. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the folder or placemark that you want to save.
2. From the contextual menu, choose Save As.
3. Navigate to the folder on your computer where you want to save the
file (see Figure 6-18).
4. (Optional) Enter a new name in the File Name text box.
5. Click the Save as Type list down arrow and select KML if you don’t
want to save the file in the default KMZ file format.
The two formats both save the same information, but KMZ files are
zipped and therefore usually smaller. (See Chapter 10 for more informa-
tion on the Keyhole Markup Language [KML] used by Google Earth.)
6. Click Save to finish the job.
You can save the image in the viewing area, too. To do that, choose File➪
Save➪Save Image from the menu (or just press Ctrl+Alt+S). The shot will be
saved in the JPEG graphic format.
To rename a placemark or folder, right-click it, choose Rename from the 
contextual menu, and have at it.
Figure 6-18:
Saving a
placemark.
100
Part II: Personalizing Google Earth 

There is, however, no Move command on the contextual menu. So what do
you do if you want to move a placemark from one folder into another one? 
Or if you need to move a folder into another folder so that it becomes a 
subfolder of that one? It’s easy, and you can do both things in a few different
ways. Here’s the simplest approach:
1. Click the placemark or folder that you want to move.
2. Hold the left mouse button and drag the item to its new folder.
3. Release the mouse button.
The placemark or folder shows up in its new location (see Figure 6-19).
If you prefer working with menus, you can also move an item this way:
1. Right-click the placemark or folder that you want to move.
2. Choose Cut from the contextual menu.
The placemark or folder is removed from the Places pane.
3. Right-click the folder where you want to relocate the item, as shown
in Figure 6-20.
4. Select Paste from the contextual menu.
The placemark or folder appears in its new location.
Figure 6-20:
Pasting a
placemark.
Figure 6-19:
Putting a
placemark
into a new
folder.
101
Chapter 6: Pinning Down Placemarks

You could also use key combinations to speed things along. To do this, just
click the item you want to work on and press Ctrl+X to cut the item or Ctrl+V
to paste it into its new location.
If you want to put the same placemark in two different folders, just use the
Copy menu option (or Ctrl+C) in Step 2 above instead of using Cut.
Sorting — by hand!
With everything else that Google Earth has going for it, the lack of a sort fea-
ture for placemarks is a bit of a shocker (one that will be fixed soon, probably
before you read this). In the meantime, every placemark or folder that you
create comes in at the top of the list.
Thus, a new placemark shows up first in whatever folder it’s created in,
copied to, or moved to via cut and paste. Whatever folder you create shows
up first in its parent folder as well, regardless of whether that folder is the
main My Places folder or one that you created yourself.
There is nothing above the My Places folder; therefore, you cannot create any
folder outside it.
The solution is simple albeit tedious. You use pretty much the same proce-
dure as for moving a placemark into a folder, only you don’t drop it on a
folder icon. Instead, you just drop it below the point where you want it to go,
as shown in Figure 6-21.
Suppose you’ve already got everything nicely alphabetized, and you just
added a placemark for something cool you saw — a zoo in Zambia — and
there it is, Z, coming before A. There’s nothing for you to do but grit your
teeth and drag your new placemark on down to the bottom of the list. If
you’ve got a lot of placemarks, make a sandwich first.

hapter 7 shows you how to set up your own tours,
which are pathways from one place to another. You
can let the program create a tour by giving you driving
directions between two locations, or you can set up your
own custom tour by placing your placemarks in the order
you choose.
Chapter 8 introduces you to the Google Earth Community,
which is the huge and fast-growing group of users who
love to share their adventures with others and are there
to help answer your questions.
Chapter 9 shows you how to use external input to enhance
your Google Earth experience. You can, for instance, import
scanned map images and use them as image overlays on top
of the existing satellite imagery. It also shows how to use
your GPS (Global Positioning System) device to add custom
data to Google Earth. (This feature is available only in the
Google Earth Plus or Pro versions.)
Chapter 10 opens up the mysterious world under Google
Earth’s hood and shows you how to use KML, the native
markup language of Google Earth files. KML is very similar
to HTML, so if you know anything at all about creating Web
pages, you’ll be modifying your placemarks in no time.

aybe you’re planning to hop in the old jalopy and see what there is to
see out on the open road. Or it could be that you’re not interested in
where the roads go at all, but you’d still like to show where several things are
in relation to each other for one reason or another.
In Google Earth, tours are the solution to these kinds of needs. A tour is an
animation of a journey along a series of points, and those points are up to
you. That journey might follow a nice smooth highway, or it might soar high
over places where even a 4-wheel drive or a mule would have trouble.
Real Roads: Getting Route Info
You can use the search results that Google Earth gives you as the basis for a
tour. When you use the Directions tab, for instance, you get not only a series
of placemarks but a slightly different way of marking things, called the Route.
Check it out and see them both in action:
1. In the Search pane, click the Directions tab.
2. Enter a value in the From text box and another in the To text box.
For example, you might want to put Chicago in the former and Detroit in
the latter, as shown in Figure 7-1.
3. Click the Begin Search button.
The results appear in the Search pane (see Figure 7-2).

After you have something to work with, take a look at a couple of different
ways of using it. The results in the Search pane consist of a series of steps
(such as turn left here, go this far, turn left again, continue for two miles, and
so on). Each step in the process is also a temporary placemark.
These Directions placemarks use an automobile icon that is green for the first
step, amber for intermediate steps, and red for the conclusion of the journey.
To play the tour:
1. Click the top level heading under the Search results.
2. Click the Play Tour button (described in the following section).
The viewing area flies to each placemark, showing each of them in the
order in which they are listed, as shown in Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-2:

Figure 7-1:

106
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

Search results are designed to be ephemeral in Google Earth; that is, they’re
automatically deleted whenever you exit the program. If you want to keep 
the results of a search you have performed, however, it’s simple to do. Those
temporary placemarks in the Search pane can be moved to the Places pane,
where they will be automatically saved when you exit Google Earth instead 
of being automatically deleted. Here’s how:
1. Choose the item you want to move.
• To move the whole set of directions: Right-click the direction set’s
top level (the one that says wherever to wherever).
• To move an individual placemark: Right-click it only.
2. Choose Save to My Places from the pop-up menu (see Figure 7-4).
That’s all there is to it.
If you don’t like using menus, you can also drag and drop items from the
Search pane to the Places pane.
Figure 7-3:

107
Chapter 7: Going on Tour

Animating placemarks and routes
In both the Search pane and the Places pane (see Figure 7-5) are two buttons
for touring: Play Tour and Stop Tour. The third button in the Search pane, by
the way, is for deleting search results and has nothing to do with tours.

Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

Although they serve the same function, each Play Tour button controls only
those items within its own pane. This means that you can’t select a folder in
the Places pane and then click the Search pane’s Play Tour button or vice
versa. If you do, you get a Tour Failed error message, as shown in Figure 7-6.
To solve this, just click OK in the error message box and then click the 
correct Play Tour button.
This problem, by the way, doesn’t exist with the Stop Tour buttons. It doesn’t
matter which pane your tour started from; click either of the Stop Tour but-
tons, and the tour will stop. No problems and no error messages.
Clicking the viewing area will stop a tour, also, just like it stops any other
motion, such as a fly-to or a zoom.
Touring a path
If you scroll down to the end of the Driving Directions placemarks, just
beyond the final automobile icon (the red one), you find one more item —
simply called Route, as shown in Figure 7-7. Click it and then click the Play
Tour button.
Right away, you notice the difference in the way the tour plays. Instead of
going to a placemark, pausing there, and then going to the next one and 
pausing again, the scene just starts at the beginning and keeps moving until 
it reaches the end. This is because the scene isn’t a series of placemarks but
rather a path.
I discuss paths in Chapter 3.
Figure 7-6:
The Tour
Failed error

Tour button.
109
Chapter 7: Going on Tour

Although paths that you create in Google Earth are found under the Places
pane, they still act just like the Driving Directions Routes do in the Search pane.
This means — you guessed it — the options you use for Driving Directions are
also the ones that will control how a path-based tour is shown on your screen.
(See the upcoming section, “Driving Directions Tour options.”)
Working the Touring Tab
Two sets of options let you control how the different display methods work.
Both are on the Touring tab, which I touch on briefly in Chapter 4. To get
there, choose Tools➪Options from the menu and then click the Touring tab.
This time, play around a bit with the settings to see exactly how they interact
with one another as well as what the strengths and weaknesses of each are.
Feel free to fearlessly fool around with these settings. No matter how far you
get from where you started, you can just click the Reset to Default button to
return everything to its pristine state.
Fly-To/Tour settings
The Fly-To Speed determines how quickly you get from place to place when
you’re clicking placemarks in the Places pane or finding locations via the Fly
To or Find Businesses tabs in the Search pane (the Directions tab is dealt
with in the next section). The Tour Speed, on the other hand, sets the pace 
Figure 7-7:
The Route
variation is
another way

110
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

at which tours are displayed. Not only can you can set them independently of
one another, but there’s another nice touch as well: the ability to use a slider
and to manually enter precise speeds.
Figure 7-8 shows the Speed slider at its default setting. Drag it to the left for 
a slower speed and to the right for a faster one. The default speed is 0.119.
The minimum is 0.0, and the maximum speed you can have is 5.0. You can, 
of course, type in a higher number, but Google Earth automatically resets it
to 5.0 when you click OK.
At the maximum Fast setting, there is actually no fly-to experience; rather
than watching the intervening land and sea zoom past on the way to your
destination, the location simply appears onscreen instantly.
Here, you can also set two other factors affecting the tour: Tour Pause and
Play Tour x Times. This, by the way, is an example of the careful attention to
detail Google lavished on this program. The interface actually changes to say
“Time” if you select 1 and “Times” if you choose 2 or more plays.
The Tour Pause value is 1.7 seconds by default, but can range from 0 (no
pause at the placemark) to 60 (a one-minute pause). Unfortunately, you
cannot set individual pause times for each of the placemarks in a tour;
instead, this is a universally applied selection. The number of times to play
the tour can range from 1 to 9,999, or you can scroll below 1 to find the
Infinite setting.
Figure 7-8:
Set the
Speed
slider.
111
Chapter 7: Going on Tour

Driving Directions Tour options
You can use the search results that Google Earth gives you as the basis for 
a tour. When you use the Directions tab as shown in the opening part of this
chapter, for instance, these are the option settings that influence how you 
see the Route part of that tour. They have no effect on a normal placemark-
based tour.
The first two settings use the metaphor of a camera hanging in the sky. You
get to aim the camera and position it. The Camera Tilt Angle is, by default, 45
degrees, which is a nice compromise halfway between flat on the ground and
straight up and down. The lowest angle you can get, by the way, is 0, just as if
you were on the ground and looking straight ahead. The highest isn’t 90
degrees, but only 80, as shown in Figure 7-9.
The Camera Range tells Google Earth how far the camera is from the tour it’s
showing. The farther away, the more area you can see but with less detail, so
you might want to experiment with this to find the best balance for your
tour’s purposes. The default value is 1,000 meters, with the lowest being 150
meters and the highest possible at 5,000 meters.
Figure 7-9:
The highest
Camera Tilt
Angle is 80
degrees.
112
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

The Camera Range setting is always in meters regardless of your measurement
options settings in Google Earth. In case you’re not familiar with the metric
system, a meter is roughly equivalent to three feet, measuring about 1.1 yards.
A kilometer, or 1,000 meters, is about 0.6 miles long and a mile, conversely, is
1.6 kilometers long. Another way to look at it is that five kilometers is roughly
three miles.
The Speed slider works just as the others do. To go faster, move to the right;
slower is to the left. Again, this slider has no effect on placemark-based tours
but only on Routes and paths.
Making Custom Tours
When it comes to touring in Google Earth, you aren’t limited to following real
roads. You can take off and go anywhere, look at anything from any perspec-
tive you want, in whatever order you want.
Planning your tours
You can just slap a bunch of placemarks together, click the Play Tour button,
and be done. Technically, that’s a tour. But after you’re past the basics, put a
bit of thought into your tour.
What is the purpose of your tour? What kinds of information are you trying to
provide, and to whom? What’s the best way to accomplish your goals? There
are as many answers to those questions as there are situations that prompt
them, of course, and each situation is unique.
In some cases, the lay of the land is automatically your friend. In others, it
goes against you. For instance, say you’re interested in showing off the natural
features of some spot. City or countryside, it’s a matter of chance exactly how
well those features will show up on satellite photos. You can usually count 
on the Terrain layer’s elevation to provide a good sense of drama in motion
during a tour, but the area you’re working with might not lend itself to that
sort of thing. Kansas and Florida, for instance, just don’t have that kind of
change in elevation.
Look at things from several angles. Rotate and tilt. Zoom in and out. Get a
good feel for all the possibilities as you look for the one that clicks best. After
you settle on that, you need to determine the best sequence of placemarks
for the tour.
113
Chapter 7: Going on Tour

The majority of times, you find some sort of natural order implicit in the tour
itself. A simple set of driving directions, for example, has to be used pretty
much as is because any change in the order or number of steps could render
it useless.
In fact, most tours will follow some sort of geographical basis, even if they
aren’t representing an actual ground or air journey. For example, if you want
to show the wonders of each continent, jumping around at random is pretty
chaotic. You wouldn’t normally show the Egyptian pyramids, jump next to
the Great Wall of China, and then rush back to show the Suez Canal, for
instance. Both aesthetically and in terms of program performance, moving 
in shorter jumps makes more sense.
Constructing the tour
Start off with making a place to put the tour, creating the placemarks for the
tour, and then saving the whole thing as a unit. Begin by making a new folder:
1. In the Places pane, right-click My Places (scroll up if necessary to see
My Places).
2. Choose Add➪Folder from the pop-up menus, as shown in Figure 7-10.
3. Type a name in the Name text box (see Figure 7-11), perhaps 
something like TourOne.
4. Enter a description in the Description text box.
You can use HTML in the description if you want to add italics or 
even a link to a Web site. 
5. Click OK to finish.
The folder appears at the top of the My Places folder, as shown in 
Figure 7-12.
Figure 7-10:

folder to
contain your
tour.

Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

Your course of action depends on whether the placemarks you want to add
to the tour already exist. If they do, then you simply need to follow one of two
procedures to add them to the TourOne folder. You can:
 Drag them from their current locations and drop them into the
TourOne folder. This permanently removes them from their old 
locations.
 Copy them from their old locations and paste those copies into the
TourOne folder. This leaves the original versions intact.
These procedures are detailed in Chapter 6.
If the placemarks for your tour haven’t already been created, you need to 
go to each location in Google Earth one by one and make a new placemark 
for each stop on the tour. To make them automatically go into the TourOne
folder as you create them, simply click TourOne before you create the new
placemarks. If you forget to do that and end up with parts of your tour else-
where, you can solve that problem by just dragging them into TourOne.
Figure 7-12:
The folder
appears at
the top.
Figure 7-11:
Name your
folder.
115
Chapter 7: Going on Tour

Speaking of dragging and dropping, you can also rearrange the placemarks
within the TourOne folder by dragging them into a new position. Remember
that they play in top-down order, so repositioning them changes how the tour
works. Thus, if you decide to add a new item to the tour, it’s an easy matter
to slip it into whatever position you want.
You’re all set. To play the tour, just click its folder to select it and then click
the Play Tour button in the Places pane.
As things stand, the TourOne folder is a part of My Places, and the tour is 
automatically saved to your hard drive along with everything else in My Places
the next time you close Google Earth. If you want to save a separate copy right
away, right-click the folder and select Save As from the pop-up menu.
If you want to share your tours with other Google Earth users, check out
Chapter 8 to see how it’s done.

In This Chapter
 Using the Keyhole forums
 Joining the Google Earth Community
 Getting help
A
s of this writing, about 600,000 people have signed up for membership 
in the Google Earth Community (the official Web site for users of Google
Earth), and more than a thousand join every day, sharing their latest dis-
coveries with one another and helping each other out in countless ways. 
This number reflects only those users who are active participants in the
forums, but you don’t have to join if you don’t want to. If you’d rather be a
“lurker” and just read the members’ posts, that’s okay. The actual number of
people who use Google Earth but haven’t signed up for the forum is anyone’s
guess — but there are more than 100,000,000 unique IPs (Internet computer
addresses) using Google Earth, so it’s probably safe to say “a lot.”
Using the Keyhole Forums
The Google Earth Community on the Web can be reached in two ways. From
within Google Earth, you can simply choose Help➪Google Earth Community
from the menu. When you do this, your Web browser automatically opens with
the Google Earth Community’s forums page already loaded (see Figure 8-1).
If you want to go there without firing up Google Earth first, just start your
Web browser and enter the URL as with any other Web site:
http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/ubbthreads.php/Cat/0
Whatever way you get there, you’ll notice that you’re not at a Google.com Web
site but one run by Keyhole.com. Don’t be confused: That’s the company that
originated the program that would later be called Google Earth, and it’s also
why the internal language of Google Earth is called KML, which is short for
Keyhole Markup Language (see Chapter 10). The user forums were already 
in existence at Keyhole.com when Google bought the program, and Google

apparently took the wise approach of, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” choosing
to leave the existing forums intact rather than make the users switch over to
some new site and learn a whole new way of interacting with one another.
There are also several other points of entry you might want to add to your
Web browser’s Favorites listing. Some of these are accessible from any
Keyhole page by clicking the links on the upper-right side. Here are the URLs
of the various Keyhole pages:
 Login
http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/login.php
The page for registered forum participants to enter their user name 
and password.
 Forum Threads

Joining the Google Earth Community
Once again, you don’t have to officially join the Google Earth Community in
order to benefit from it. You can still read the posts, view the images, download
the files, and so forth. Still, there are some important things you can’t do, like
starting a new topic of discussion. If you want to just take a look around, you
can skip this section and jump ahead to the next one. However, if you find 
that you’re ready to shed your lurker status and want to become an active 
participant in the Google Earth Community, it’s a simple and painless process:
1. Open your Web browser and go to the New User page at
http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/newuser.php (see Figure 8-2).
119
Chapter 8: Mingling with the Community

Alternatively, if you have Google Earth running, you can choose Help➪
Google Earth Community.
2. When the Forum Threads page appears, click the New User link at the
top right.
3. Enter a name in the Login Name text box.
This name is what you use as your user name when you log in.
4. Type another name in the Display Name text box.
This name is the one by which the other users in the Google Earth
Community know you.
5. Type your e-mail address in the next two text boxes.
You have to enter it twice as an error-checking measure.
6. Type your password in the final two text boxes.
7. Click the Submit button.
If there are any problems (such as mismatching e-mail addresses or
trying to choose an existing user’s login name), you will be asked to 
correct them and resubmit. Otherwise, you get a page saying that you
have registered.
8. Check your e-mail for a message asking you to confirm your registra-
tion. Click the link in that message to confirm your registration.
If your e-mail software doesn’t support embedded Web links, copy the
URL and paste it into the Address bar in your Web browser.
Figure 8-2:

Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

Signing on to the forums
After you register, you’re ready to log on. How you log on varies depending
upon your point of entry to the Google Earth Community. (See the preceding
section for details.) If you get there via the Google Earth Help menu, you need
to click the Login link (upper left of the screen), which takes you to another
page (see Figure 8-3) where you enter your user name and password. The
same is true for the Main Index and every other page except for the Entrance.
If you go in via the Entrance, use the logon box at the upper right, where you
can enter that information without having to go anywhere else first.
These forums use cookies to manage your sessions, so you need to make
sure that your Web browser is set to accept them before you log in.
After you enter the appropriate info in the Login Name and Password text
boxes, click the Login button. You’re in.
If you want to have the site set a cookie on your system so you don’t have to
type the info in every time you go there, select the Remember Me on Each
Visit check box.
If you forgot your password, scroll down and enter your Login Name and
e-mail address in the text boxes at the bottom of the page; then click the I
Forgot My Password button.
Figure 8-3:
The Login
page.
121
Chapter 8: Mingling with the Community

After you log on, you’ll find yourself looking at a Web page like the one in
Figure 8-4. This is My Home, and you’ll notice that there’s also a new link
along with the standard Keyhole pages — My Home. Whenever you’re logged
on, that link takes you to your account management page from any other
page you might be viewing.
Browsing the forums
There are a variety of ways to get to the forum postings. You can get to them
via the Main Index or Search pages, for instance. For these examples, start
where Google Earth starts you off: the Forum Threads page, as shown in
Figure 8-5, which is the page you reach when you choose Help➪Google 
Earth Community from the Google Earth menu.
The main categories are shown on the left side: News, Earth, Other Planets,
Discovery Club, Education, and so on. These are the same as the ones on 
the Main Index page, but they are expanded here to also show their subcate-
gories, thus saving you an extra step (although eating up a bit more screen
space). For example, the Education category shows subheadings of Students,
Educators, and Tools. To get a look at the messages in those areas, just click
the heading.
Also note the links on the right side that take you instantly to the most
recently posted message in each forum.
Figure 8-4:
My Home
on the
Keyhole
forums.
122
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

After you select a forum, you’ll find yourself looking at a complete list of
threads, such as the one shown in Figure 8-6. A thread is a series of messages
on the same topic. Thus, if you post a new message and someone replies to
it, both of those messages are parts of the same thread.
Figure 8-6:
A thread
listing.
Figure 8-5:
The Forum
Threads
page.
123
Chapter 8: Mingling with the Community

Note the series of control buttons on the upper-right side that let you handle
the forums more easily:
 Start a New Topic: Use this to send your own message to the forum.
The Start a New Topic button won’t function unless you’re a registered
member who is logged in.
 Previous: This takes you back one thread in the forum (unless you are
on the first topic in the forum).
 Index: This has a ToolTip (place your mouse’s pointer over the button
to see it) that reads Main Index, but it actually takes you to the Forum
Threads page.
 Next: This takes you forward one thread in the forum (unless you are on
the last topic in the forum).
 Expand: This turns the listing of threads or topics into a complete list of
every message.
When you do this, the Expand button toggles to the Collapse button 
(see Figure 8-7). Clicking the Collapse button makes the listing revert 
to topics only (and the button, of course, goes back to Expand).
Beneath these buttons, each column has a heading showing things like the
subject and who posted the original message. If you click those headings, the
page is re-sorted. For example, if you click the Subject heading, the subjects
show up in reverse alphabetical order; click the same heading again, and they
show up in alphabetical order.
Figure 8-7:
Expand the
threads.
124
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

When you click a thread, you get a page like the one in Figure 8-8. This shows
the original post at the top and a listing of all the replies to it (and replies to
the replies, because they also form part of the thread). To see them, simply
scroll down and click any that interest you.
The Expand/Collapse button also changes to Flat. If you click it, the listing of
the replies at the bottom disappears. Instead of just the list of messages, you
get all the messages displayed fully on the same page. The button now reads
Threaded, and if you click it, the original listing will return.
If you’re a registered and logged-on user, you’ll see Reply and Quote buttons
along with each message you view. They both generate a reply: The first one
gives you a blank text area, and the second quotes the message you’re
responding to, just like in traditional e-mail messages.
Searching the forums
Although browsing through the forums is a fascinating activity, you might
prefer to use the search feature instead. It can save you hours of wasted time
by focusing your reading to only those messages that have certain keywords
in them. It’s also a lot less complex than browsing. Here’s how it’s done:
1. Go to the Search page (see Figure 8-9).
• If you’re already on one of the Google Earth Community’s Web pages:
Click the Search link at the upper right to get there.
Figure 8-8:
Reading the
threads.
125
Chapter 8: Mingling with the Community

• If you’re not already on one of the Google Earth Community’s Web
pages: Use your Web browser to go to http://bbs.keyhole.
com/ubb/search.php.
2. Choose which forum to search in the (you guessed it) Forums to
search listing on the left side. Scroll down if necessary to find the 
one you want.
If you want to search everything, leave things at the default All Forums
setting. If you want to search more than one forum but not all of them,
hold down your Ctrl key as you click the forum names.
3. Enter the words you want to look for in the Keyword Search Terms
text box.
4. Select where to search:
• To look for those terms only in the titles of messages: Select the In
Subject radio button.
• To look for them in both the title and text: Make sure that the In
Subject and Body radio button is selected instead.
5. To limit the search results to only those messages written by a particular
person, enter that name in the Username Search text box.
To find every message written by a particular user, skip Step 3 and just
enter that name with no search terms.
Figure 8-9:
The Keyhole
Search
page.
126
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

6. To limit the results to a particular time frame, enter a number in
either the Newer Than or the Older Than text box, and then choose
Day(s), Week(s), Month(s), or Year(s) from the drop-down list next to it.
For instance, if you want to find a message you saw within the past two
weeks, you enter a 2 in the Newer Than text box and then choose Week(s).
7. In the Result Format text box, type the number of search results you
want on each of the results page.
The default value is 25, and the maximum is 99.
8. Select the Show a Preview of Post Body with Results check box to
make the results page includes the first line of the message; other-
wise, you get only the subject listed.
9. Click Submit.
The results appear on a Web page like the one in Figure 8-10.
Getting Help
The Google Earth Community itself is a real boon to users of the program. The
Help menu within Google Earth itself, however, is another matter. There really
isn’t much in the way of help available in the program — it’s all on the Web.
When you choose Help➪Help Center Website, you get the Web page shown 
in Figure 8-11, and it’s not as helpful as you might need. It’s more of a simple
FAQ (list of Frequently Asked Questions) mixed in with some info about
billing and a few technical details.
Figure 8-10:
A Search

page.
127
Chapter 8: Mingling with the Community

You can go there from outside Google Earth by entering the following Web
address into your browser:
http://earth.google.com/support
Where you’ll find real help is in the Google Earth User Guide, which is, of
course, accessed by choosing Help➪User Guide from the menu. This is a
much fuller exploration of the program and is more likely to have the
answers you’re looking for (see Figure 8-12).

You can download an Adobe PDF version if you’d rather keep the whole User
Guide on your own computer. You can find it at
http://earth.google.com/userguide/v4/google_earth_user_guide.pdf
If you bought the Google Earth Pro subscription, you also get tech support
via phone.
Exploring Outside
Although the official Google Earth Community is quite an impressive site, it’s
far from the only place supporting Google Earth users or enhancing their
experience. There are an ever-increasing number of sites like Google Earth
Hacks (see Figure 8-13) that you can enjoy exploring. Although a full survey
of Google Earth-related sites would need a whole new book, Table 8-1 gives
you a nice start, listing several sites that deal with Google Earth.

Importing Data and Images
In This Chapter
 Adding custom data to Google Earth
 Using image overlays
 Positioning, rotating, and scaling imported information
 Importing information from GPS devices
A
lthough Google Earth is an awesome combination of both software 
and data, sometimes you just have to go outside the program to get
something you need, such as more detailed demographic data or a historical
map. Just for the sake of argument, say you live someplace (or just want to
research it) that isn’t on the lists of the most desirable real estate on the
planet. Well, Google Earth (like everything else) pays the most attention 
to the squeakiest wheels, and it’s a simple fact that your uncle’s farm in the
boonies just doesn’t compete with the heart of Manhattan’s high-rent district.
Where do you turn if you need (or just want) something better than Google
Earth has to offer in some area? Or what if you have some kind of specialized
data that’s really important to you but not of much interest to the rest of the
world? Don’t toss out Google Earth; it can still accommodate your needs.
Adding Custom Data to Google Earth
Say you’ve got something that you’re particularly interested in — something
that you just can’t find in the current version of Google Earth. Perhaps it’s
information like annual rainfall patterns in your home county or the incidence
of different types of malaria in 19th-century Africa, or maybe you’d like to lay 
a drawing of a proposed housing development on top of some vacant lots.
Are you lost? Is there nothing you can do? Fortunately, the answer is a
resounding, “NO!” Google Earth is fully capable of accommodating your
needs. All you’ve got to do is to tell it where to find the data, and it’ll add it.
Chapter 14 tells you where to find it, and this chapter tells you how to add it.

Using image overlays
Probably the most common type of data you’ll want to add is an image over-
lay, which is just what it sounds like — a picture or drawing that you put on
top of the base image in the viewing area. You can easily drop these image
files into Google Earth. The drawback to using image overlays is the same 
as for any other addition you make: They take up some of your computer
resources; and, the more you add, the greater the drain.
To help lessen the strain, use the smallest file size that will do the job. Convert
a TIFF file to a JPEG, for instance, to save space. Google recommends that you
never use a file larger than 2,000 pixels square.
Here’s how to add an image overlay:
1. Navigate in Google Earth to where you want to add the overlay.
Make sure that the scene in Google Earth matches as closely as possible
the one in the image you’re going to lay over it. Depending upon your
source image, you might need to zoom in or out, drag the scene around,
or adjust the tilt angle, for example.
2. When you’ve got the right spot in the Viewing area, click the Add
Image icon on the toolbar (see Figure 9-1).
Alternatively, you can choose Add➪Image Overlay from the menu or use
the keyboard combination Ctrl+Shift+O.
3. In the resulting New Image Overlay dialog box (see Figure 9-2), type a
name for the overlay into the Name text box.
4. Click the Browse button and navigate to the image file you want to
open as an overlay (see Figure 9-3).
You can use image files only in the following formats:
File Type
Extension
Bitmap
.bmp
GIF
.gif
JPEG
.jpg or .jpeg
PNG
.png
Targa
.tga
TIFF
.tif or .tiff
5. Double-click the name of the desired file, or just click it and then click
Open.
The image displays in Google Earth, as shown in Figure 9-4.

6. (Optional) Enter a description in the Description text area.

Chapter 9: Importing Data and Images

7. Click OK to make sure that the overlay is added to the other resources
in My Places.
If you feel like working without a net, you can go ahead and work with
the overlay without saving it first. (See the upcoming section,
“Positioning, rotating, and scaling.”)
Figure 9-4:

Figure 9-3:

134
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

If you take the daring route, skip ahead to the following section. If you
play it safe, the image overlay you just added is listed at the top of My
Places, but the New Image Overlay dialog box disappears from your
screen, and you need to get it back before going on.
a. Right-click the new overlay listing in My Places.
b. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu (see Figure 9-5).
This brings up the Edit Image Overlay dialog box, which is identical to
the New Image Overlay dialog box.
Transparency
Before you can position an image overlay precisely, you need to make the
image at least slightly transparent so that you can see what’s underneath it.
Feel free to vary this setting as needed while you work with the image over-
lay. You can turn it off when you’re done.
Setting the transparency is about as simple as it gets. Just click the
Transparency slider and drag it (see Figure 9-6).
Dragging the slider to the left (Clear) increases the transparency; dragging 
it to the right (Opaque) makes the image overlay increasingly (you guessed 
it again) opaque. At the far right, you can’t see anything behind the image
overlay. At the far left, the overlay itself disappears because it becomes 
completely transparent. It’s still there as an object in Google Earth; it’s just 
an invisible one.
The opacity of an image overlay is only in relation to the underlying satellite
imagery. Layers like roads and water bodies still appear on top of it, regard-
less of its transparency setting.
Figure 9-5:
Modifying
properties.
135
Chapter 9: Importing Data and Images

Positioning, rotating, and scaling
Odds are pretty good that the image you import won’t be an absolutely 
perfect fit for the view you’ve got in Google Earth. That means you have to
monkey with it a bit to get things just the way you want them, like rotating 
or scaling the image.
Unless the area you’re working with is perfectly flat, make sure that Terrain is
turned on in the Layers pane. That way, the image overlay drapes itself over
the shape of the land and blends in perfectly.
If the New Image Overlay/Edit Image Overlay dialog box is getting in your
way, move it to the side by clicking and dragging the dialog box’s title bar.
Assuming that you’ve got your image overlay loaded approximately where you
want it and you have the Edit Image Overlay dialog box open, here’s what you
need to do next, starting by looking at the image overlay. It has a series of
green markings on it (see Figure 9-7). Each of these is a control for positioning
the overlay.
If the green handles don’t appear, either the Edit Image Overlay dialog box
isn’t open, or the image overlay’s transparency is set to Clear.
1. Move your mouse pointer until it’s over the green plus mark in the
center of the image.
When you’re in the right spot, the pointer changes from an open hand to
a pointing index finger.
Transparency slider

Transpar-
ency slider.
136
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

2. Press and hold the mouse to move the pointer.
The image follows the movement, allowing you to position it precisely
where you want it.
3. Resize the image overlay.
• Click one of the green L-shaped markers at the corners of the image
and drag them to resize the image’s height and width simultaneously.
You probably want to resize the image overlay proportionally in most
cases — that is, you want it to retain the same relationship of height
and width that it originally had as you stretch and shrink it — so you
need to hold down your Shift key as you resize it. Otherwise, you end
up with some distortion of the original image’s proportions. When
you do this, your mouse pointer changes to a quadruple arrow.
• Click one of the T-shaped markers on the sides to stretch the
image vertically or horizontally with the double-arrow cursor.
Figure 9-8 illustrates the image being resized from the right side marker.
The left side marker is different from the other three side markers — note
the diamond-shaped control at the end of it. This is the final repositioning
tool, which you use for rotating the image overlay. Your mouse pointer
becomes a pointing hand when it’s over the rotation tool. Click it; while
holding down the mouse button, move the pointer up to rotate the image
overlay clockwise and down to rotate it counterclockwise (see Figure 9-9).
Green markings
Figure 9-7:
Positioning
the overlay.
137
Chapter 9: Importing Data and Images

You can use these various resizing/repositioning controls in combination to
put the image overlay just where you want it. Typically, you would first resize
the image proportionally to make it fit the underlying area, and then rotate it
as needed to align the various features in the image overlay with the screen
display in Google Earth. You might also need to move one or more of the sides
in to make the two images coincide and then perhaps to move the image just a
tad in one direction or other until you’re finally satisfied that it’s a good fit.
Precision location
Although you can do a lot with the tools already covered, visual approaches
don’t allow you to have really pinpoint control over your image overlay.
Google has thought of that, though, and you can set the location with mathe-
matical precision if you have an overlay where you know the exact location 
of its edges (such as when you’re overlaying with an image of a map done by
a professional surveyor).
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. On the Location Tab (see Figure 9-10), enter the precise latitudes in
the North and South text boxes and the longitudes in the East and
West text boxes.

Chapter 9: Importing Data and Images

Sometimes you get lucky and get your hands on georeferenced overlays, which
are images that have their corner location data (in latitude and longitude)
embedded within the image. This allows Google Earth to read the info and
properly place the image: It will automatically size and place a georeferenced
overlay. Of the Web sites that perform this service, www.gpsvisualizer.
com/kml_overlay is a primary one.
Use the Draw Order setting when you have multiple image overlays that all fit
into the same place. In most such cases, which one is on top matters, and the
Draw Order number determines this. The image overlay with the value of 0 is
on the bottom, 1 is on top of it, 2 is on top of that, and so forth.
The bad news is that this feature is active only in the Google Earth Pro ver-
sion. If you’re using the freebie or the Plus version, though, you can still set
the draw order. Simply add the bottom overlay first, the second level next,
and so on until you’re done. The Draw Order number for all of them is offi-
cially 0, but they’ll still show up in the order you added them.
Importing from GPS Devices
Google Earth is a product of the modern world, after all. As such, it recog-
nizes that people go wandering about the planet with modern gadgetry, like
Global Positioning System (GPS) devices.
GPS users rely upon a system of artificial satellites in orbit around the Earth.
The radio signals from these satellites, when combined, can tell a GPS receiver
exactly where it’s located in terms of longitude and latitude as well as exactly
how high it is above sea level.
Exactly which GPS devices Google Earth works with is kind of up in the air,
but certainly most of them made by the two most popular manufacturers,
Garmin and Magellan, have been tested successfully.
Even if you don’t own a Garmin or Magellan unit, however, you can probably
still use your GPS device with Google Earth. Even if your device won’t
directly connect with the program, the odds are pretty good that it comes
with some kind of software interface that will allow you to save its data as
one of the common GPS file types, such as .loc or .gpx.
After you do that, Google Earth can then simply import that data from your
computer without having to ever have been connected to the non-supported
GPS device. All you have to do is
1. Choose File➪Open.
2. In the Open dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-11, choose Gps from the
Files of Type drop-down list.
140
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

3. Navigate to the location of the file you want to import.
4. Double-click the name of the desired file (or just click it and then 
click Open).
This same technique, with the exception of the type of file chosen in Step 2, 
is used to open all types of external data files that Google Earth can import.
If you do have a Garmin or Magellan GPS device, you can transmit its data
directly into Google Earth without having to save it first:
1. Connect your GPS device to your computer with the cable that came
with it for this purpose.
2. Turn on the GPS device.
3. In Google Earth, choose Tools➪GPS.
4. In the resulting GPS dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-12, select either
Garmin or Magellan in the GPS Manufacturer panel.
5. In the Import panel, enable the check box(es) to select what points 
to import.
6. In the bottom portion of the dialog box are three more check boxes
used for setting the way the imported information is displayed in
Google Earth.They’re pretty self-explanatory:
Figure 9-11:

GPS data.

Chapter 9: Importing Data and Images

• Draw Icons at Track and Route Points: Adds a graphical symbol at
each imported point.
• Draw Lines for Tracks and Routes: Makes Google Earth connect all
the dots.
• Adjust Altitudes to Ground Height: Ignores any altitude information
that was imported and makes the points (and connecting lines, if
you chose that option) hug the terrain. You might, for instance,
have data that you recorded while flying over the terrain but want
to show the path of the flight as a line on the ground.
7. Click OK.
Google Earth first checks for a USB cable connecting to the GPS device;
if it doesn’t find one, it cycles through all your serial ports looking for
the device’s connection.
If you’re properly connected and Google Earth still can’t find your GPS
device, make sure that the software drivers for it are installed. Typically,
this means that you need to install the software that came with your GPS
device.
8. After the GPS device is found, Google Earth begins downloading the
data from it.
When it’s finished, you’ll see the dialog box shown in Figure 9-13.

KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML
In This Chapter
 Creating and saving KML files
 Understanding KML’s syntax
 Exploring useful KML tags
 Working with styles
A
mong the ever-expanding alphabet soup of markup languages — HTML,
XML, and so forth — there’s a newcomer you’re going to want to know.
It’s KML, short for the Keyhole Markup Language, and it’s at the heart of
Google Earth.
Markup languages like HTML (HyperText Markup Language, used to make
Web pages) have a different intent from programming languages. Although
these definitions are a bit arbitrary, markup is used only to define how things
are shown on a computer screen. (Programming is used to define processes
that take place in a computer.) You don’t have to worry about programming
Google Earth, but you can do a lot about defining the view it gives you.
Keyhole.com, by the way, was the company that originated the program that
would later be called Google Earth, and it’s also why the internal language of
Google Earth is called Keyhole Markup Language — KML.
Creating and Saving KML Files
Fortunately, working with KML doesn’t require any kind of specialized soft-
ware. You can use any kind of text editor, even Notepad, which comes with
Windows. However, if you’re really serious about it, you might want to try
HomeSite+ for Windows or Barebones’ BBEdit for the Mac.

Do not use a word processor as your text editor. Word processing programs,
such as Microsoft Word, add their own formatting to the saved file, and this
interferes with your KML code.
The process is about as simple as it gets. I’ll use Windows Notepad in the 
following example:
1. Open your text editor.
2. Type in the KML code (that you’ll work with later in this chapter), 
as shown in Figure 10-1.
3. When you’re finished, choose FileÍSave from the menu (or use the
Ctrl+S key combination) and then navigate to the folder where you
want to save the file.
4. In the File Name text box, type the filename including the .kml
extension, as shown in Figure 10-2.
That last part is critical. If you don’t add the extension yourself, Notepad
automatically adds a .txt extension instead.
5. Click Save.

Mastering the Syntax
If you’ve ever worked with any kind of computer code, even if it’s just 
HTML, you’ll find KML familiar territory. It’s very much like HTML, in fact, 
so don’t let the idea of getting under the hood and playing with Google 
Earth intimidate you.
Nonetheless, if you try to use a malformed KML file with Google Earth, all
you’ll get is an error message for your trouble, so it’s worth paying a bit of
attention to the details before you get started.
Tags and elements
KML works like other markup languages, using tags to specify which elements
to use. An element is one of the basic building blocks of the language, and a
tag is the manner in which that element is represented in a bit of KML code.
For example, the Placemark element is represented by the <Placemark>
tag. Tags are always delineated by these double brackets, and every element
requires both a beginning and an ending tag. Thus, a Placemark element is
always represented like this example:
<Placemark>placemark data</Placemark>
Figure 10-2:
Saving the
KML file.
147
Chapter 10: KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML

Don’t worry for now about the placemark data part — that’s just a place-
holder for either an attribute of the <Placemark> tag or another nested ele-
ment. I cover attributes in the next section and the whole issue of nesting
elements later on.
You’ll notice that the start tag and the end tag differ in only one way — the
end tag includes a slash before the element’s name.
Attributes
Elements tell Google Earth what something is, but attributes tell the program
what to display.
Say, for instance, that you have two different addresses to deal with. You
would — you’ve already guessed this, I’m sure — use two instances of the
address element. Within each, you would specify the attributes — the actual
street address, for example.
If you wanted to show the addresses of the White House in Washington and of
Google in California, the tags and attributes would read as follows:
<address>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC</address>
<address>1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA</address>
Despite the similarity of the first part of the addresses, these two locations
are on opposite sides of the continent, and their differences are specified in
the simple and standardized information contained in the tags’ attributes.
(See the section on the Address tag later in this chapter.)
Containers
Everything in KML, just as in HTML, is involved in what is technically known
as a container relationship. Attributes, for example, must be contained within
the elements themselves. Moving outward from there, one element can be
contained by another element, which can be contained by another, and so
forth. To phrase it another way, everything in a KML file must be nested
within something else.
This containment is sometimes referred to as a parent/child relationship. Any
element that contains another element is the parent, and the elements that it
contains are the child elements.
148
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

If you violate this parent/child relationship, your KML files won’t work properly.
Failure to properly contain elements is perhaps the single most important factor
that generates annoying errors when you try to import your homemade KML
files into Google Earth.
To build upon the earlier examples, a Placemark element would be the
parent of an address element, which would, in turn, be the child of the
Placemark element. It is customary to indent the child element in the 
code listing in order to distinguish it from its parent element, like this:
<Placemark>
<address>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC</address>
</Placemark>
Capitalization matters in KML. If you try for a <Placemark> tag or an
<address> tag, things won’t work.
Of course, this containment can’t go on forever; after all, there has to be
something at the top that contains everything else, and there is. The top-level
element in this hierarchical relationship is the root element, and only four
root elements are possible in KML.
The root element
When you create a KML file, the first thing you need to do is to specify its
root element. If you’re dealing with a simple situation like a single location
you want to show, you would likely use the Placemark element, but three
other possibilities exist, as I mention in the preceding section.
The other three are KML, Document, and Folder. So, how do you choose
which root element to use in a particular situation? It depends on what child
elements it needs to contain. Here’s the hierarchy: KML, Document, Folder,
Placemark. If you’re putting several placemarks together, you want to have 
a folder as the root. Several folders should, in turn, have a document as their
root, and KML is the granddaddy that can contain all the others. You’ll see
how it all works as the example code in this chapter develops.
Comments
Even when you’re working with short KML files, I recommend annotating
what you’re doing with comments, which are short pieces of text you type
right into the source code for your file. You might know every detail of the file
and understand exactly why you did everything you did — today, that is. But
what about when you look at that file a year from now? Trust me, by then, it’ll
149
Chapter 10: KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML

just be another piece of a lost past. Comments are also a great help if you’re
planning to send the file to somebody else, and you want to help him under-
stand what he’s looking at.
Thankfully, you don’t have to keep a written journal of your efforts in order to
keep a reminder. KML comments come to your rescue. Two special symbols
work much like the start and end tags of elements: A comment opens with
<!-- and ends with -->. Here’s how it looks as a line of code:
<!-- Comment goes here -->
Of course, you don’t type the Comment goes here part but replace that
with whatever it is you want to say.
Comments not only serve as memory joggers for you, but they can help you
to find a file on your computer — just search for files containing the words
you used in the comments.
The Most Useful KML Tags
This section starts with simple tags and their attributes. Each builds upon
the other to show how to do more complex things.
Placemarks
Try one of the most familiar features of Google Earth — the good old place-
mark. The start and end tags for it are
<Placemark> </Placemark>
When you send a placemark to a friend, you’re really sending her a short KML
file, and there’s a lot of information that can be included between those two
tags. Here’s a bare bones version of the KML code for a simple placemark:
<Placemark>
<name>Hollywood Bowl</name>
<description>The Los Angeles Philharmonic’s amphitheater</description>
<visibility>0</visibility>
<LookAt>
<longitude>-118.3390383230917</longitude>
<latitude>34.11230602728949</latitude>
<altitude>0</altitude>

Figure 10-3 shows this placemark in Google Earth:
The name and description elements
The name element corresponds to the Name text box when you’re creating or
editing a placemark (see Figure 10-4). Likewise, the description element
and the Description text area contain the same information. In fact, this part
of the Google Earth interface is designed to gather the data to place in the
KML code for the placemark; when you type anything here or alter any set-
tings on any of these tabs, the result is ultimately written to KML.
Figure 10-3:

151
Chapter 10: KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML

The visibility element
Within Google Earth, you control the visibility of a placemark by selecting its
check box to either select it (make it visible) or deselect it (make it invisible).
The visibility element controls whether or not the placemark’s icon is
visible at the time you load the placemark’s KML file. It has no effect whatso-
ever on what happens after that point — you can click the placemark’s check
box to deselect it anytime you want.
To set the placemark so that its icon is automatically visible on loading, like
the one in Figure 10-5, use this code:
<visibility>1</visibility>
To make the icon invisible on loading, just change the 1 to a 0 (zero).
The LookAt element
With the LookAt element, it’s pretty obvious that what you’re looking at is
the placemark. But who’s doing the looking? It’s perhaps easiest to just think
of yourself as floating in the air, but the metaphor common to GIS programs,
including Google Earth, is that of a camera which floats in the air and sends
us a view of what’s in front of its lens.
Figure 10-4:
Google
Earth

152
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

The six child elements of the LookAt element basically represent two sets 
of elements that are used to specify the location of the placemark and the
camera that’s looking at it. In each case, you need to specify three specific
measurements.
<LookAt>
<longitude>-118.3390383230917</longitude>
<latitude>34.11230602728949</latitude>
<altitude>0</altitude>
<range>272.1817526117454</range>
<tilt>1.485907294467841e-010</tilt>
<heading>-0.004589114879398169</heading>
</LookAt>
Locating the placemark: The longitude, latitude, and altitude elements
In order to locate a placemark, you have to give its longitude, latitude, and
altitude. As you can read in Chapter 2, longitude and latitude are the lines that
crisscross maps, specifying how far away a place is from the prime meridian
and the equator.
Figure 10-5:
Setting the
visibility of
an icon.
153
Chapter 10: KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML

This means that you are telling Google Earth how far east or west a point is
with the longitude value, how far north or south it is with the latitude
value, and how high it is with the altitude value.
The longitude and latitude elements are the only ones that are actually
required to make LookAt work. If you don’t specify any of the others, they
will all default to 0 (zero).
The altitude element, you will note, is set to 0 in this code. However, the
Hollywood Bowl is something like 600 feet above sea level, and the placemark
isn’t 600 feet below the ground. The reason for this is that in the absence of
instructions to the contrary, Google Earth takes any altitude value to mean
the same as Clamped to Ground (see Figure 10-6). This, for most purposes, 
is fine. However, if you know the exact altitude of the location and want the
placemark to float above it, you can override this. You’ll need to get a bit
more specific about how you want altitude handled by setting the values in
the altitudeMode element. (See the section entitled “Altitude and
altitudeMode” later in this chapter.)
Positioning the camera: The range, tilt, and heading elements
The camera needs to be located in three-dimensional space just as much as
the placemark that it’s viewing does. The method for doing this is a little bit
different from specifying the location of the placemark, though. You’re not
trying to specify a point within the longitude/latitude/altitude system but
rather a point that exists relative to the placemark.
Figure 10-6:

ically

154
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

First, you need to tell Google Earth how far away from the placemark the
camera is. This is done via the range element. This works as if you had a
camera on the end of a rope. The other end of the rope is figuratively tied to
the ground at the location you specified for your placemark, and the range
value tells how long the rope is.
After you know how far you are from your placemark, you’ve still got a lot 
of room to move around that center. Say that rope is a mile long; the camera
could be a mile east of the placemark or a mile west of it, or anywhere in
between, and it could be lying on the ground or a mile in the air.
So, even though you’ve established the range, you’ve got only one of the
three pieces of information you need to position the camera.
That’s where the tilt and heading elements come into play. The tilt
value tells Google Earth what the angle of the camera is. Now that it knows
the distance (range) and the angle (tilt), it can figure out the altitude of the
camera. However, that still leaves a very large circle in which the camera 
can be located.
Now, you have to tell Google Earth the last bit of information: what direction
the camera is pointing in. That’s the job of the heading element. A heading
value is given in degrees, a concept which is not hard to grasp. Remember
that every circle is divided into 360 degrees? There’s an imaginary circle —
usually represented by a compass rose on a map — in which north is at the
top, or at a heading of 0 degrees. South is at the bottom — half a circle away,
at 180 degrees. East (on the right) and west (on the left) are, respectively, at
90 degrees and 270 degrees.
So, what if you want to point your camera toward the south? You’d use a
heading value of 180. Toward the east? 90. And so forth. Table 10-1 shows
the degree values for the major subdivisions of common directions:
Table 10-1

When you’re pointing the camera toward one direction, you’re looking from
its opposite. For example, if the camera’s heading is toward the east, you’re
looking from the west. Figures 10-7 and 10-8 show the same scene from oppo-
site camera headings.
Figure 10-7:
Facing east.
156
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

You can also specify negative degrees, if you’re so inclined. In that case, west
would be –90 instead of 270, and east would be –270 instead of 90. South
would be –180 instead of 180, but north will always be 0. To get the negative
degree value of a heading, subtract 360 from it.
Pinning the icon: The Point element
The Point element tells Google Earth where to put your placemark’s icon. 
If you leave it out, you won’t see one. Normally, of course, the icon should 
go exactly where the placemark itself is located, so you’ll see the same longi-
tude, latitude, and altitude values as are found in that placemark’s LookAt
element.
However, they’re handled a little bit differently. Instead of separate elements
for those three values, a single element combines them all: the coordinates
element. In this example, it looks like this:
<Point>
<coordinates>-118.3390383230917,34.11230602728949,0</coordinates>
</Point>
The order is important in the Point element. You have to enter the longi-
tude, latitude, and altitude in that order. When specifying location in the
LookAt element, it doesn’t matter which comes first. Although they were
listed in order of longitude, latitude, and then altitude, they didn’t have to 
be. The following code is just as valid as the example one:
Figure 10-8:
Facing west.
157
Chapter 10: KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML

<LookAt>
<latitude>34.11230602728949</latitude>
<altitude>0</altitude>
<longitude>-118.3390383230917</longitude>
...
</LookAt>
If you try that with the coordinates element, though, you’ll end up with
things in the wrong place.
The coordinates element cannot be used as a child of LookAt; you must use
the separate longitude, latitude, and altitude elements there instead.
The Snippet element
You’re already familiar with the name and description elements, but here’s
one more way to add some written information to your placemark — one that
you just can’t do inside Google Earth. That’s the Snippet element, and it
works a little strangely.
Like the name element, it accepts only plain text; you can’t embed any HTML
code within it. Like the description element, it can show up under the
placemark in My Places, but it can also show up elsewhere, and even elbow 
a competing description aside.
The code couldn’t be simpler:
<Snippet>text goes here</Snippet>
Just type in whatever you want in place of text goes here, and you’re all set.
But what do you want to see when you load the placemark? Check out the
options. First, redo the example so that it has a snippet in place of the
description, as in the following modification. The name has also been
changed to reflect the purpose of the example; other than that, everything is
the same.
<Placemark>
<name>Hollywood Bowl with Snippet</name>
<Snippet>A natural formation with seats added</Snippet>
<visibility>0</visibility>
158
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

<LookAt>
<longitude>-118.3390383230917</longitude>
<latitude>34.11230602728949</latitude>
<altitude>0</altitude>
<range>272.1817526117454</range>
<tilt>1.485907294467841e-010</tilt>
<heading>-0.004589114879398169</heading>
</LookAt>
<Point>
<coordinates>-118.3390383230917,34.11230602728949,0</coordinates>
</Point>
</Placemark>
Normally, you see the description’s text under the placemark’s icon, but if you
leave out the description, you’ll see the snippet’s text there instead. Here’s
one other odd thing you’ll notice — there’s no link to the placemark (see
Figure 10-9). This doesn’t mean that the placemark doesn’t work; the link is 
to the description, which is what is shown in the text balloon. No description
equals no link.
Figure 10-9:
No de-
scription
means no

link.
159
Chapter 10: KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML

However, you can have both working at the same time as well. If you add the
description element back into the code while leaving the snippet, too, as in
the following code sample, you get a different result — the link is back.
<Placemark>
<name>Hollywood Bowl with Snippet</name>
<description>Description added back in.</description>
<Snippet>A natural formation with seats added</Snippet>
<visibility>0</visibility>
<LookAt>
<longitude>-118.3390383230917</longitude>

<Point>
<coordinates>-118.3390383230917,34.11230602728949,0</coordinates>
</Point>
</Placemark>
The snippet’s text still shows under the placemark in the Places pane, but the
description’s text is available by clicking the placemark’s link to display the
text balloon (see Figure 10-10).

Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

Altitude and altitudeMode
If you’ve read this chapter to this point, you’ve seen the altitude element
as a child of the LookAt element. As you might recall, the value is automati-
cally set to the same as ground level unless you tell Google Earth to do things
differently. The way you do so is via the altitudeMode element.
This has three possible values, each of which corresponds to the same 
settings on the Altitude tab in Google Earth (see Figure 10-11).
As I mention in Chapter 6, there are three different methods for displaying
the placemark’s icon:
 Clamped to Ground: The same level as the ground.
 Relative to Ground: altitude value added to the ground’s altitude.
 Absolute: Not really absolute at all — it’s actually just relative to sea
level instead of ground level.
The Google Earth option Clamped to Ground becomes the value
clampToGround, Relative to Ground becomes relativeToGround, 
and Absolute is absolute. Thus, if you wanted to choose the second 
option, you’d use this code:
<altitudeMode>relativeToGround</altitudeMode>

Chapter 10: KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML

You don’t really need to use the clampToGround value. If you want things
clamped to the ground, just don’t specify any altitudeMode at all.
The address element
If you’ve read this chapter to this point, you’re already familiar with the lon-
gitude, latitude, and coordinates elements, but here’s another way to
specify a location that’s a little bit more to the taste of the average person — a
street address. As you might guess, you use the address element to do that.
As usual in KML, the process is a simple one. The drawback is that it’s limited
to locations in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. If that
area covers the turf you’re working with, here’s how to go about it.
You can use any usual form of address as the value for the address element.
Thus, you may have something like this:
<address>123 Main Street, Smalltown, KS</address>
You can also use a ZIP code (or Canadian or British postal code) either as 
a part of the address or as a standalone value. In the latter case, the exact
point will be more or less in the geographical center of that ZIP code area
(see Figure 10-12):
<address>90210</address>

Working with Styles
Although earlier versions of KML supported local styles (embedded within
individual placemarks), they are now deprecated in favor of a global style
environment. In this section, I show you how to work at a higher level of file —
not just a simple placemark, but a folder which contains several placemarks.
You can extend these concepts to include even larger KML files.
First off, you’re going to go all the way up in the root element department.
When working with a complex file, it’s best to play it as safe as possible in
order to avoid any possibility of generating errors. So this is the most complex
piece of KML code you’ve seen so far. Still, start off small and build from there:
<?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?>
<kml xmlns=”http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1”>
<Document>
<Folder>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
</Folder>
</Document>
</kml>
The opening two lines of this segment specify some technical details that you
don’t need to worry about but that are very helpful to Google Earth (or any
other program that can read KML files). They tell that program that this file is
done in KML version 2.1, which falls under the XML version 1.0 standard, and
that it uses standard text encoding methods.
The second line is also the real beginning of the file as far as your display is
concerned. That’s the top-level <kml> element, which will contain everything
else as a child element. Notice that the last thing in the file is the </kml>
closing tag, in order to keep things tidy.
Within this set of tags, the next level is the Document element, which will
contain any and all folders you assign to this file. (For this example, you’re
keeping it down to only one folder.)
The next level represents the Placemark elements that will reside in the
folder. This is the basic skeleton of the file you’ll be creating. Now, all that
remains is to fill it in with all the good stuff.
163
Chapter 10: KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML

The Style element
The Style element itself is the parent for everything you’ll want to do style-
wise. Everything from the size and color of text to which icon shows up
onscreen is handled here. In this section, you’ll explore several ways to use 
it to spruce up your Google Earth experience.
To get things started, add it in the appropriate location. A global style definition
can be a part of the Document element or the Folder element, and is available
to all that element’s children. In this example, put it in the document itself to
make it available to all folders that might be added to this file in the future.
Thus, you need to amend the code example to read:
<?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?>
<kml xmlns=”http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1”>
<Document>
<Style>
</Style>
<Folder>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
</Folder>
</Document>
</kml>
Note that the Style and Folder elements are at the same level, equal chil-
dren of their parent document. This style of indenting each element to signify
its position in the container relationship is meant to make the code easier to
understand.
The styleUrl element
When you create a style, you give it a name, but it’s called an id here instead.
This name can then be used to reference the style you’ve created whenever
you need to use it. The id value must be unique, of course, so that Google
Earth can tell which style you mean when you call on it.
Expand the code example by adding a second Style element and giving
them two names:
<?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?>
<kml xmlns=”http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1”>
<Document>
<Style id=”StyleOne”>
</Style>
164
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

<Style id=”StyleTwo”>
</Style>
<Folder>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
</Folder>
</Document>
</kml>
From now on, anytime you want to apply one style or the other, all you have
to do is give their names. For example, say you want to apply StyleOne to
the first placemark. You simply add the styleUrl element to the placemark
like this:
<Placemark>
<styleUrl>#StyleOne</styleUrl>
</Placemark>
That little # tells Google Earth to look inside this file for a style definition
named StyleOne. You can use styles from another file as well, but you have
to specify the URL so that Google Earth can find it. For example, if you’re
looking for a style called RainbowSunset on a distant Web server, you might
use something like this:
<Placemark>
<styleUrl>http://www.notinthisfile.edu/
butinthisone.xml#RainbowSunset</styleUrl>
</Placemark>
After you understand how to name and reference a style definition, you’re
ready to do some styling!
LabelStyle
The LabelStyle element corresponds to the Label settings on the Style,
Color tab (see Figure 10-13). The Color and Opacity settings are combined into
a single color element here, while the scale is set by the scale element.
The color value is one of the easiest concepts to understand, of course.
Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most difficult to handle in KML. This is
because it requires hexadecimal numbers for input. The numbers you’re
probably used to working with everyday are in base 10, but hexadecimal
(hex) numbers are in base 16, which uses the numbers from 0 through 9 
normally and then substitutes the letters A through F for numbers 10 
through 15 and then wraps things up by using the number 10 for 16.
165
Chapter 10: KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML

Although professional programmers have long been used to this, they’re
pretty much Greek to the average Google Earth user. What can be even more
confusing is that these numbers, which specify four different settings, are all
run together into one long number.
Here’s how it looks:
<color>ff0055ff</color>
If you were to break it all out, you would see that there are actually four num-
bers here: ff, 00, 55, and ff. In normal decimal notation, they are 255, 0, 85, and
255, respectively. The first one sets the alpha (or opacity) value. The remain-
ing three specify the amount of blue, green, and red, in that order.
For all these values, the hex notation ff is the highest possible (255 decimal).
Thus, if you want something totally opaque and red, you set it like this:
<color>ff0000ff</color>
Translation: complete opacity (ff), no blue (00), no green (00), complete red (ff).
To help you through this potentially bewildering mathematical maze, Table 10-2
gives the hexadecimal values for various levels of opacity, and Table 10-3 lists
those for some common colors.

label values.

As you can see, the opacity values are two characters each, and the colors
have six characters. The latter are, of course, pairs of numbers representing
the same three colors to mix that you dealt with before (blue, green, red), so
you can just plug them in right away. All you have to do is to put the opacity
value in, followed by the color value. Thus, if you want to create a color that
is 80% opaque and of an olive hue, you take the CC from Table 10-2 and add it
to the 008080 from Table 10-3 to get
<color>cc008080</color>
To set the size of a label, you use the scale element. The following code, for
example, makes the label twice its size — in both dimensions. The label is
twice as high and twice as long. This means that the actual result is that the
label takes up four times the area it will at a setting of 1.0 (normal size).
<scale>2.0</scale>
Allowable values for the scale range from 0.0 to 4.0.
Aside from the standard settings you can manage within Google Earth, you can
toss one more thing into the mix if you like strange and unpredictable effects:
The colorMode element allows you to randomize the colors, using a different
one each time. To do this, you simply add this line to your color definition:
<colorMode>random</colorMode>
Add all that into the developing file’s source code in the part that defines the
options for StyleOne:
<Style id=”StyleOne”>
<LabelStyle>
<color>cc808000</color>
<scale>2.0</scale>
<colorMode>random</colorMode>
</LabelStyle>
</Style>
168
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

Now, whenever this style is applied to a placemark, the placemark’s labels
assume all these properties.
IconStyle
The IconStyle element is much like the LabelStyle one except that, of
course, it applies to the placemark’s icon itself instead of the lettering next to
it. It uses the same color, colorMode, and scale child elements but adds
two more as well: icon and heading.
The icon element is used to specify which image to use for the icon. This is 
a required child element of IconStyle, so even if you’re going to use the 
regular icon, you need to say so. Assuming that you want to leave the colors
and the scale as they were in the preceding example, here’s how to do that:
<IconStyle>
<color>cc808000</color>
<scale>2.0</scale>
<colorMode>random</colorMode>
<Icon>
<href>root://icons/palette-3.png</href>
</Icon>
</IconStyle>
To change the icon to any other, simply substitute its location in the Icon
element’s href child element.
The heading element determines which way the placemark’s icon is facing.
It works just like the same thing in the LookAt element: A value of 0 aims the
icon to the north, 90 to the east, 180 to the south, 270 to the west, and so
forth. (See Table 10-1 for a listing of directions and their degree values.)
Here’s a version of the preceding that uses a custom icon and points it
toward the eastern horizon:
<IconStyle>
<color>cc808000</color>
<scale>2.0</scale>
<colorMode>random</colorMode>
<Icon>
<href>c:/GoogleEarthIcons/MyOwnIcon002.jpg</href>
</Icon>
<heading>90</heading>
</IconStyle>
169
Chapter 10: KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML

Go ahead and add this new code to the example as part of the second style
definition:
<?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?>
<kml xmlns=”http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1”>
<Document>
<Style id=”StyleOne”>
<LabelStyle>
<color>cc808000</color>
<scale>2.0</scale>
<colorMode>random</colorMode>
</LabelStyle>
</Style>
<Style id=”StyleTwo”>
<IconStyle>

</IconStyle>
</Style>
<Folder>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
</Folder>
</Document>
</kml>
Radio buttons and check boxes (listStyle)
After you have two different style definitions set up, turn to the folder you
created but haven’t developed yet. The first step is to give it a name and
description. Go ahead and modify that part of the source code so that it
reads something like this:
170
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

<Folder>
<name>StyleExample</name>
<description>Shows different styles being applied</description>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
</Folder>
If you wanted to, you could just go ahead to the placemarks now, but you’ll
want to explore a couple of other things first. One is the open element. This
is similar to the visibility element used for placemarks in that it sets the
manner in which the folder is shown at first. Here’s how it works:
<Folder>
<open>0</open>
</Folder>
A value of 0 means that the folder is closed, and you have to click the plus
sign next to it to see what it contains. Change the value to 1, however, and
the folder is initially shown with everything in it showing as well.
The other thing to explore is another way of changing the appearance of the
listings in the Places pane using the listItemType and listStyle elements.
Normally, the folders have check boxes next to them that you use to activate 
or deactivate the contents. By changing the list style in which the placemarks
are displayed, you also alter the behavior of a click. With the default check box
style, you can simultaneously select two or more placemarks. If you replace the
check boxes with radio buttons, however, each placemark you select is exclu-
sive; choosing one shuts off the other. Figures 10-14 and 10-15 show how the
two methods work.
Figure 10-14:
The default
check box
style.
171
Chapter 10: KML: It’s Sorta Like HTML

The two values that create these are, respectively, checkHideChildren and
radioFolder. You simply create a style with either value in it, and you’re off
and running. To set a folder for radio buttons, for example, you would do this:
<Style id=”buttonsNotBoxes”>
<ListStyle>
<listItemType>radioFolder</listItemType>
</ListStyle>
</Style>
You don’t ever need to specify the checkHideChildren value. Because it’s the
default display method, it’s already active if you don’t specify radioFolder
instead. Go ahead and add this style to the example, along with the other things
I just covered:
<?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?>
<kml xmlns=”http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1”>
<Document>
<Style id=”StyleOne”>
<LabelStyle>
<color>cc808000</color>
<scale>2.0</scale>
<colorMode>random</colorMode>
</LabelStyle>
</Style>
<Style id=”StyleTwo”>
<IconStyle>
<color>cc808000</color>
<scale>2.0</scale>
<colorMode>random</colorMode>
<Icon>
<href>c:/GoogleEarthIcons/MyOwnIcon002.jpg</href>
</Icon>
<heading>90</heading>
</IconStyle>
</Style>
Figure 10-15:

172
Part III: Becoming a Cybertourist 

<Style id=”buttonsNotBoxes”>
<ListStyle>
<listItemType>radioFolder</listItemType>
</ListStyle> 
</Style>
<Folder>
<name>StyleExample</name>
<description>Shows different styles being applied</description>
<open>1</open>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
</Folder>
</Document>
</kml>
You’re almost done now. Other than adding a couple of placemarks, all you
have to do is to reference those styles in the appropriate places. Start with
the folder and style it with the buttonsNotBoxes style. Do that by adding 
a line right under the opening tag, <Folder>, like this:
<Folder>
<styleUrl>#buttonsNotBoxes</styleUrl>
<name>StyleExample</name>
<description>Shows different styles being applied</description>
<open>1</open>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
<Placemark>
</Placemark>
</Folder>
Now it’s time to apply each of the other two remaining styles to one of the
placemarks, like this:
<Placemark>
<styleUrl>#StyleOne</styleUrl>
</Placemark>
<Placemark>
<styleUrl>#StyleTwo</styleUrl>
</Placemark>
173

oogle SketchUp — one of the greatest things about Google Earth — is a
standalone companion program that lets you design 3-D models that
you can then import into Google Earth and include as a part of the landscape.
Like Google Earth itself, Google SketchUp comes in both free and paid ver-
sions ($249 for the Pro version); the paid version offers a few extras such as
greater flexibility in exporting files, but the freebie is an almost unbelievably
robust piece of 3-D software.
Even if you don’t have a lot of artistic talent, you can use a whole slew of
existing models as the basis for your own creations. 3D Warehouse
(http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse) is a collaboration
between Google and SketchUp’s original designers to provide a repository for
various premade 3-D graphics and objects. It also provides a way for users to
share their own 3-D designs. And the best news is that the models are free!
You can have it both ways with Google SketchUp — make your own dream
house from scratch or pick one of the models and drop it into Google Earth.
The flat image of the Statue of Liberty, for example, just doesn’t have the zing
you expect (see Figure 11-1). Add the model of that famous structure from 3D
Warehouse, however, and the scene comes alive (see Figure 11-2).

The Google SketchUp Interface
Google SketchUp is a powerful 3-D modeling program, and its controls reflect
both its complexity and its versatility. Like with most graphics programs, the
majority of the screen area is taken up by the drawing area, with menus and
toolbars at the top and (in some cases) on the side.
Although the simple default version, as shown in Figure 11-3, will suffice for
many of your design needs, sometimes you’ll need more features, and Google
SketchUp has plenty more, to put it mildly. Figure 11-4 shows the same pro-
gram with all its toolbars active at once.
Touring the toolbars
Each of the toolbars in Google SketchUp supplies a set of tools for a specific
type of task. For example, drawing tools are grouped together, as are the con-
trols for setting different views.
To see each toolbar, choose View➪Toolbars from the menu and then select
any toolbar from the resulting popup menu (see Figure 11-5). Only the Google
and Getting Started toolbars are active by default.

Part IV: Advanced Features 

The Camera toolbar
The Camera toolbar, as shown in Figure 11-6, includes several controls for
altering the view onscreen.
The tools here are:
 Orbit: Lets you move the camera over, under, and around the 3-D object,
viewing it from any angle.
 Pan: Used for moving the scene vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
 Zoom: Used to zoom in, on, or out from the 3-D object. Move your
mouse wheel away from you to zoom in and toward you to zoom out.
 Zoom Window: Used to zoom in or out from a part of the 3-D object.
 Zoom Extents: Lets you automatically zoom in or out so that the entire
3-D object is in view.
 Previous: Switches back and forth between the current view and the
previous one.
The Construction toolbar
The Construction toolbar (see Figure 11-7) is more of a tool belt than a tool-
bar, with a trusty tape measure handy and several ways to work on your
“blueprints.”

Chapter 11: Designing with Google SketchUp

The tools here are:
 Tape Measure: Just like a tape measure in real life, you hook it at one
end and drag it to the other to see how long something in the scene is.
 Dimension: Use this to add a line showing the measurement of an
object.
 Protractor: Again, just like a real one; you lay the Protractor tool at a
corner of an object, anchor it to another, and then move your cursor to
interactively measure the angles from the base.
 Text: Use this to add callouts (text with a line pointing to a specific fea-
ture) to the scene.
 Axes: Use this to adjust the orientation of the three axes on the screen.
Google SketchUp simply refers to them as the red, green, and blue axes,
but these correspond to the normal X, Y, and Z axes familiar to all 3-D pro-
grams. When interfacing with Google Earth, the green (Y) axis points north,
the red (X) axis points east, and the blue (Z) axis points straight up.
 Section Plane: This tool allows you to slice your 3-D models to show
cutaway views of their interior construction.
The Drawing toolbar
The Drawing toolbar, as shown in Figure 11-8, provides the tools for adding
basic shapes and lines as well as creating more complex variations on them.
The tools here are:
 Rectangle: Draws rectangles (including squares).
 Line: Draws straight lines. A series of straight lines can be intercon-
nected end to end to form more complex designs.
 Circle: Draws circles.
 Arc: Draws arcs (partial circle segments). Like with the Line tool, you
can use the end of one arc as the beginning point of another, chaining
them together to design intricate patterns.

hexagonal (six-sided). You can specify the number of sizes, but all poly-
gons begin to approximate a circle when you add more than about a
dozen sides.
 Freehand: For doodling. The Freehand tool works exactly as if you had a
pencil in your hand with which you could draw onscreen. Use this tool
to add hand drawings, signatures, and so on to your work.
The Display Style toolbar
The Display Style toolbar contains controls that determine how your work is
rendered onscreen (see Figure 11-9). It is a common practice in 3-D design to
use Wireframe during most of the design stages and Shaded with Textures
only for fine-tuning or during the final stages of the project. Because Wireframe
drawings have a lot less detail, they place fewer demands on a computer’s
resources than the more complex shaded renderings. This means that the
program runs a lot faster, saving the memory- and processing-intensive fine
touches for when everything else is just right.
This grouping of five controls is really a 1/4 situation. The last four items all
set various levels of rendering. The X-Ray control, however, has nothing to
do with the kind of rendering that is used. Instead, it works with the other
controls.
The controls here are:
 X-Ray: This control turns all faces (solid areas between lines) transpar-
ent in order to reveal the construction behind them. Using this doesn’t
affect rendering style.
 Wireframe: The least detailed (and least demanding) form of rendering,
this control shows an object as a series of connected lines with no fur-
ther detail. You can see through the whole object.
 Hidden Line: One step more detailed than Wireframe, this control adds
faces between the lines. Anything that’s behind a face is hidden by it.
The effect is to create a more realistic image.

Chapter 11: Designing with Google SketchUp

 Shaded: Moving into intensive computing demand, this option goes
Hidden Line one better by adding color and shading to the object.
 Shaded with Textures: This control is by far the most computer-intensive
setting but the one that produces the most detail in the image. Textures
such as brick, wood grain, and so forth are now displayed in nearly pho-
torealistic rendering.
The Google toolbar
The Google toolbar, as shown in Figure 11-10, is one of the default toolbars
(along with Getting Started). It has five items that affect Google SketchUp’s
interaction with its companion program, Google Earth.
The tools here are:
 Get Current View: This transfers an image of whatever is in the Viewing
area in Google Earth to Google SketchUp.
 Toggle Terrain: This turns the Terrain feature on and off, just like the
Terrain layer in Google Earth.
 Place Model: This transfers the 3-D model you are working on from
Google SketchUp into Google Earth.
 Get Models: This opens a 3D Warehouse Web page from which you can
download 3-D models for use in SketchUp and Google Earth.
 Share Model: The flip side of Get Models, this lets you post your own 
3-D models from SketchUp to 3D Warehouse.
The Modification toolbar
The Modification toolbar (see Figure 11-11) gives you various ways to either
move or alter the shapes of the objects in Google SketchUp.

Part IV: Advanced Features 

The tools here are:
 Move/Copy: This tool is used to move a 3-D object or to reposition por-
tions of an object. Pressing Ctrl changes the function to reposition a
copy of an object while leaving the original where it was.
 Push/Pull: This tool is used to extrude faces (areas between connected
lines). The extrusion can be either positive or negative. For example, a
simple circle can become either a towering cylinder (positive) or a hole
in the ground (negative).
 Rotate: This tool is used to turn an object or portion of an object in a cir-
cular motion, pivoting on a fixed point. Like with the Move/Copy control,
you can press Ctrl to change this to “rotate a copy” mode.
 Follow Me: Similar to the Push/Pull control, this extrudes a face as well.
However, the extrusion follows the path of your mouse pointer.
 Scale: This tool is used to interactively alter the measurements of some
or all the dimensions of a 3-D object.
 Offset: This, too, creates a copy of a face, allowing you to enlarge or
reduce the copy either inside or outside the original.
The Layers toolbar
The Layers toolbar, as shown in Figure 11-12, helps you manage — you guessed
it — layers. Layers are like the canvas on which you create your 3-D artwork.
In a simple model, everything will be done on one layer. When things get more
complex, however, multiple layers are involved. When you load an image with
terrain from Google Earth, for example, you end up with new layers.

of layers available depends on how many you have created.
 Layer Manager: Opens the Layer Manager, from which you can add or
delete layers, control which layers are visible as well as what their base
colors are.
The Principal toolbar
The smallest toolbar in Google SketchUp (see Figure 11-13), the Principal tool-
bar, has only three basic controls, but they are ones you will use constantly.
The tools here are:
 Select: This is used to click objects or parts of objects to indicate which
of them you want to work on.
 Paint Bucket: This “pours paint” onto your 3-D models to add color to
them. It also adds textures such as wood or stone, which provide an
extra touch of realism to your models.
 Eraser: This erases lines.
The Sections toolbar
If you’ve already used the Section Plane tool in the Construction toolbar to
create cutaways, the Sections toolbar, as shown in Figure 11-14, controls how
the results are displayed.

The tools here are:
 Display Section Planes: This shows the actual section plane itself — the
“guillotine blade” that cuts the 3-D object.
 Display Section Cuts: This hides the section plane while showing the
results of the cutaway.
The Shadows toolbar
Although this toolbar (see Figure 11-15) lets you quickly play with the date and
time settings that affect which way the shadow goes and how long it is, the
Shadow Settings dialog box gives you pinpoint control over the date and time.
The tools here are:
 Shadow Settings: This opens the Shadow Settings dialog box, where you
can set default date and time of day as well as adjust the darkness of the
shadow.
 Display Shadows: This toggles the display of shadows on and off.
 Date: Click this control to choose which month it is in the scene.
 Time: Click this control to choose the time of day in the scene.
The Standard toolbar
This toolbar contains all the things you would expect in a typical toolbar in
most programs (see Figure 11-16), yet it isn’t one of the defaults. You’ll proba-
bly want to activate this one first thing unless you like doing without Undo,
Redo, Print, and the other usual functions available in the average program.

 Model Info: Opens the Model Info dialog box, which presents you with
many possibilities from setting the text size and background to viewing
statistics on how many lines, materials, and so forth have been used in
your model
The Views toolbar
The Views toolbar, as shown in Figure 11-17, presents five buttons, each of
which automatically shifts the view to a different perspective. The first, Iso,
gives the isometric view, which is the default in Google SketchUp. This means
you are looking at the scene from a bit above and to the side. Which side
depends upon what you were looking at before.
The five remaining perspective buttons are self explanatory: Top, Front,
Right, Back, and Left.
The Walkthrough toolbar
The Walkthrough toolbar, as shown in Figure 11-18, is another tiny one. Its
three occupants set the situation when you feel like you want to be a part of
the scene on your screen.

 Walk: This control shows an interactive view of the current scene as if
you were walking within it.
 Look Around: Like Walk, this makes you feel like you are actually stand-
ing in the scene but instead of walking around, only your eyes move.
The Getting Started toolbar
This toolbar (see Figure 11-19) duplicates several tools found in different
toolbars. The Paint Bucket, for instance, comes from the Principal toolbar,
and the Rectangle tool comes from the Drawing toolbar. It is meant to be a
hodgepodge of the controls you are most likely to use regularly. See those for
the tools’ descriptions.
The Getting Started toolbar is, along with the Google toolbar, one of the two
defaults (active when you open the program).

SketchUp, Part 2
In This Chapter
 Creating a 3-D model
 Moving your creation to Google Earth
 Exploring the Google SketchUp community
I
n this chapter, you can follow along as I work my way through a running
example that shows you the basics of creating a 3-D model that you can 
use in Google Earth. Don’t worry — it’s nothing complicated, but you can walk
away with a good grounding in how Google SketchUp works and what you can
do with it. For the specifics of the various SketchUp tools, see Chapter 11.
The example demonstrates how you can “build” a house. Along the way, 
I show you how to spruce up the structure with details like windows and
doors. Beyond the basics, the house will also have a swimming pool and 
a rooftop deck. I also explore using textures to create materials like wood,
glass, and stone to enhance the realism of your creation.
Then, when the house is done, I show you how to move it into Google Earth
and add it to the landscape.
After you understand how to do these things, you can either modify this
model or create your own from scratch. Pop your model into Google Earth 
to test-fit it in various locations to see how it looks. Or, figure out how many
homes like it could fit within a planned subdivision. Of course, you’re not l
imited to just making houses — the only limit is your own imagination.

Creating a 3-D Model
To avoid any confusion at a critical moment, make sure that the following
toolbars are activated before you start:
 Views
 Getting Started
 Google
To activate a toolbar, choose View➪Toolbars from the menu and then choose
the toolbar you want. If you need to review what’s on which toolbar, read
Chapter 11.
Creating a yard and a house
The two minimums when it comes to housing are some kind of building on
some kind of lot. Start with the first things first and make a nice spot of land
to build on — say 100' x 110'. Then you can lay down a nice green lawn.
Although you can certainly experiment if you want to, stay with me and use
exactly the measurements I give you for this example because everything is
designed to fit together.
To start with the yard:
1. Click the Top icon on the Views toolbar.
This way, you’re looking directly down.
2. Select the Rectangle tool.
3. Click in the drawing area and without releasing the mouse button,
drag the pointer to any other spot. Release the mouse button.
You see something like Figure 12-1.
4. Type 100,110.
Do this before you do anything else. You don’t have to click anywhere
first — just type the numbers, including the comma — but no space.
These numbers show up in the Dimensions text box in the lower-right
corner (see Figure 12-2).
5. Press Enter.
The rectangle is automatically sized to the dimensions of 100' x 110'.
196
Part IV: Advanced Features 

Now add some texturing to the rectangle so it looks like a real lawn. While the
rectangle is still selected, follow these steps:
1. Click the Paint Bucket icon.
2. In the Materials dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-3, choose Vegetation.
Then choose the first item shown — Grass.
3. Click within the lawn rectangle.
It takes on the texture of a grass lawn.

Chapter 12: Designing with Google SketchUp, Part 2

With a little spot to call your own, put something — how about a house? —
on it. Once again, start with a rectangle but do something special to it this
time — extrude it upward so that it becomes a three-dimensional solid.
In order to fit neatly within the yard and still leave room for later development,
the house will be 60' x 40'. Give it a height of 12'.
1. Select the Rectangle tool.
2. Click within the lawn rectangle, drag the pointer to any other location
and then release the mouse button.
3. Type 60,40 in the Dimensions text box and then press Enter.
4. Select the Move/Copy tool.
5. Click the house rectangle and drag it so that it is positioned as shown
in Figure 12-4.
6. Give the structure a texture:
a. Click the Paint Bucket icon.
b. In the Materials dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-5, choose Concrete
and then choose Smooth Face Concrete Block.
c. Click within the house rectangle to apply the concrete texture.
7. Click the Iso icon on the Views toolbar.
This changes the screen so that you’re no longer looking at things from
directly overhead but rather from above and a bit to one side, as shown
in Figure 12-6 — an isometric view.
Figure 12-4:
Position the
house on
your lawn.
198
Part IV: Advanced Features 

8. Click the Push/Pull tool.
9. Click the house rectangle; then, while holding down the mouse
button, move the Push/Pull tool upward.
The rectangle follows the tool and extrudes upward from the ground
(see Figure 12-7).
10. Release the mouse button, type 12, and then press Enter.
The house is three-dimensional — measuring 60' x 40' x 12' — and all
walls share the original concrete texture.
Adding the deck, porch, and patio
Your house can be way more than just a block of brick or cement sitting in
the middle of a lawn. Spruce it up a bit by adding a deck to the top, a porch at
the front, and a patio at the back. The porch will be the smaller of the group,
measuring only 5' x 3', and the patio will be much larger at 60' x 30'.

Building the deck
Tackle the deck first, which is sunken into the roof with dimensions of 
58' x 38' x 3'.
1. Click the Top icon on the Views toolbar so you are looking at the view
from directly above.
2. Select the Rectangle tool.
3. Click within the rooftop area. While holding down the mouse button,
move the tool to any other spot and then release the mouse button
(see Figure 12-8).

4. Type 54,34 and then press Enter.
5. Select the Move/Copy tool, click within the deck rectangle, and 
position it so that it appears as shown in Figure 12-9.
6. Add a texture to the deck:
a. Click the Paint Bucket icon.
b. In the Materials dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-10, choose Wood
and then choose Wood-floor-dark.
c. Click within the deck rectangle to give it a wooden texture.
7. Click the Iso icon on the Views toolbar to get back to the isometric view.
8. Click the Push/Pull tool.
9. Position the tool within the deck rectangle; then, while holding down
the mouse button, move it downward and release the mouse button.
The results look like Figure 12-11.

10. Type 4 and then press Enter.
This places the floor of the deck exactly four feet below the top of the
surrounding wall.
The walls of the deck area share the sunken deck’s wooden texture instead of
the concrete texture of the outer walls.
Adding the porch and patio
The porch and patio are similar, but they are located at opposite ends and
have different sizes. The porch will be larger than the front door (but not
overwhelming), and the rear patio will be as wide as the house itself.
1. Select the Rectangle tool.
2. Click the lawn behind the house, drag the pointer to any other 
location, and then release the mouse button.
3. Type 60,30 in the Dimensions text box and then press Enter.
4. Select the Move/Copy tool.
5. Click the patio rectangle and drag it so that it’s positioned as shown 
in Figure 12-12.
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5, this time creating the porch rectangle in front
of the house. Also, for Step 3, enter 3,5 as the dimensions. For Step 5,
drag the rectangle to a position like that shown in Figure 12-13.

Adding a swimming pool
A few amenities never hurt anyone. I mean, a patio is nice, but a patio with a
swimming pool is even nicer. In this part of your building saga, add a built-in
pool at the back of your property and fill it with virtual water.
1. Click the Top icon on the Views toolbar.
2. Select the Rectangle tool.
3. Click within the patio area. While holding down the mouse 
button, move the tool to any other spot and then release the 
mouse button (see Figure 12-14).
4. Type 40,20 and then press Enter.
These dimensions make the pool fit neatly into the existing patio (60' x 30').
5. Select the Move/Copy tool, click within the pool rectangle, and position
it so that it appears as shown in Figure 12-15.
6. Select the Push/Pull tool.
7. Position the tool within the pool rectangle. While holding down the
mouse button, move it downward and then release the mouse button.
The results look like Figure 12-16.
8. Type 6" (that’s inches, not feet) and then press Enter.
You have a sunken surface that will shortly become “water.”

Time to change the pool’s texture. At this point, its texture is still concrete
because it inherited the patio’s texture, so I’ll change it to one of the more
liquid textures.
This process varies from the one used to create the wooden rooftop deck ear-
lier because I want the pool walls to remain concrete and not to share in the
water transformation. If you apply the water texture first, this isn’t possible.

2. In the Materials dialog box, choose Water and then choose either
Water-pool or Pool Water.
3. Click within the pool rectangle.
The results look like Figure 12-17.
Allowing entry and light: Adding 
doors and windows
The place is starting to look much more livable, but something significant is
missing — namely, doors and windows. Read along to see how to add two 
different kinds of windows and two different kinds of doors to turn your plain
old solid block into a normal house.
The standard windows will be 6' x 3', and the single picture window is 14' x 7'.
Standard doors are 3' x 7', and the garage door is the same as the picture
window: 14' x 7'.
1. Click the Front icon on the Views toolbar so that you are looking at
the front of the house.
2. Select the Rectangle tool and draw a rectangle on the front of the
building, as shown in Figure 12-18.
3. Type 14,7’ and then press Enter.

4. Select the Move/Copy tool, click within the picture window rectangle,
and position it so that it appears as shown in Figure 12-19.
5. After you have one window, you can work with copies of it instead 
of having to draw a new one every time. Press Ctrl; while holding it
down, repeat Step 4.
The original picture window remains in place while a copy of it is moved.
6. Position the copy as shown in Figure 12-20.
This copy becomes the garage door.

textures to the picture window first and then the garage door.
• For the picture window: Choose Glass+Transparent➪Glass Sky
Reflection.
• For the garage door: Choose Metal➪CorrogateShiny.

Part IV: Advanced Features 

Notice that the glass window actually functions like a window: It’s not just a
pretty bit of reflection but allows you to see through the wall as if it were
actually made of glass.
To add more, smaller windows, simply repeat Steps 1 through 4, using 6,3 as
the measurements in Step 3.
Every home also needs some way to actually get inside, so toss in a front door
as well, using the Push/Pull tool to inset it a few inches from the outer wall.
Once again, you’re dealing with a rectangular shape, so repeat Steps 1 through
4 of the preceding step list, with the exception that the measurements in Step 3
are 3,7 and that the door should finally be positioned as shown in Figure 12-22.
Now you have a situation like with the pool. You want the door to be made of
wood, but you want the surrounding doorway itself to be made of the same
material as the walls. Thus, you need to do the “push” first.
1. Select the Push/Pull tool.
2. Position the tool within the door rectangle; while holding down the
mouse button, move it downward and then release the mouse button.
The results look like Figure 12-23.
3. Type 4" (inches, not feet) and press Enter.
4. Use the Paint Bucket to add Wood,Wood-cherry texture to the front
door (see Figure 12-24).

To add windows and doors to the other sides, simply select the appropriate
icon from the View toolbar (Left, Right, Back, and so on) and repeat the
process. Don’t forget to make it easier on yourself by using the Copy part 
of the Move/Copy tool!

Driveway
If you have a garage, it stands to reason that you have a driveway leading 
to it. The size of the driveway is pretty much constrained by all the other
dimensions you’ve used to this point. It needs to be precisely as wide as that
door — 14' — as well as reach from the edge of the lot to the garage door. In
this part of your building endeavor, set the one figure as an absolute mea-
surement while doing the other by eyeball.
1. Select the Top icon on the Views toolbar.
2. Draw a rectangle approximately in front of the garage door, as shown
in Figure 12-25.
3. Type 14 and press Enter.
This use of only the first measurement specifies the width of the drive-
way while leaving its length as you drew it. If you want to specify the
opposite — the length — type something like ,20 instead. Note: Using
the leading comma is important because that tells Google SketchUp 
that you’re not supplying the first number.
4. Switch to Iso view and then select the Move/Copy tool.
5. Position the driveway rectangle in front of the garage door.
6. Click the edge of the driveway that is farthest from the garage door.
While holding down the mouse button, drag that edge until it reaches
the edge of the lot.
7. Use the Paint Bucket tool to apply a texture of Colors➪Black to the
driveway rectangle.

Stepping stones
One way people keep their lawns nice and neat is to provide a pathway from
the street to the front door so that people don’t wear their own path through
the grass. Take a break from the rectangular world and put down a series of
circular stepping stones.
In doing so, you create two pathways: one from the driveway to the porch,
and one from the edge of the lot. Just to show that not everything runs in
straight lines in the world of Google SketchUp, make the one from the drive-
way follow an arc:
1. Select the Top icon on the Views toolbar.
2. Select the Line tool.
3. Click the edge of the porch at the center; while holding down the
mouse button, draw a line to the edge of the lawn (see Figure 12-26).
This line won’t be there long; it’s only intended as a guideline for the
placement of the stepping stones.
4. Select the Circle tool.
5. Move the point of the pencil over the line you just drew.
A red dot shows at the tip when it’s in the right spot.

Moving Your Creation to Google Earth
Monkeying around with 3-D models is fun, but the whole point of Google
SketchUp is that you can use it with Google Earth. To do so, just follow these
simple steps:
1. Launch Google Earth.
2. Go to the location where you want to place your model.
3. Within Google SketchUp, click the Place Model icon on the Google
toolbar (see Figure 12-31).
Your model appears shortly in Google Earth, listed at the bottom of the
Places pane, under Temporary Places (see Figure 12-32).
After your creation is in Google Earth, you can change its properties just as
with any other object except that you can’t right-click it to do so. Instead, you
have to right-click its name in the Places pane.
This is a fine approach if you want to try the model out in different locations.
However, if you absolutely, definitely, positively, and without a doubt know
where it’s going to go before you start building it, here’s an even better way:
Just click the Get Current View button before you start. This automatically
imports whatever is in the Viewing Area in Google Earth into Google
SketchUp, where you can then go ahead and add your changes.
Use the Toggle Terrain button to switch between a flat view and one that
shows the actual shape of the land (see Figure 12-33), so you know how the
building sits.

The Google SketchUp Community
Just like with Google Earth, a community of Google SketchUp users is active
on the Web. It’s not as large yet, of course, because SketchUp is a newcomer
to the Google Earth toolbox, but it’s well worth checking out. You can get
there by choosing Help➪Google SketchUp Community from the menu. Or 
you can just use your Web browser to go directly to
http://groups.google.com/group/sketchup
In addition to exploring the forums, you should check out the existing 3-D
models. These have been created both by Google and by Google SketchUp
users, and many of them are very nice, indeed. Here’s how:
1. Click the Get Models button.
This brings up a Web page, as shown in Figure 12-34.
2. To download one of the models on the main page, click it.
3. In the resulting description page (see Figure 12-35), click the
Download Model button.
If you click the View in Google Earth button, the model is sent there
instead. This is useful if you simply want to see the model but not
modify it in any way.
A dialog box appears, asking whether you want to download the model
directly into Google SketchUp.

orking with basic shapes in Google SketchUp is usually sufficient, as I
show in the preceding chapter. After all, many things that surround us
are made up of simple rectangles, circles, and the like, from our houses to our
bookcases and tables, or even cereal boxes and cans of corn. However,
Google SketchUp can do a whole lot more than that.
In this chapter and the following one, I wrap up the tour of Google SketchUp 
by showing you how you can use even more tools and techniques to create not
only simple multisided figures like triangles and pentagons but truly complex
structures like the ones in Figure 13-1. You can use these structures to create
marvelous models to add to Google Earth, whether your intentions are to
create industrial models, modify architectural structures, or to just plain get
goofy and see what you can come up with.
Before starting these examples, make sure that you have the following toolbars
activated:
 Views
 Modification
 Getting Started
 Drawing
To activate a toolbar, choose View➪Toolbars from the menu and then click
the toolbar’s name.

Joining Shapes
Even with the basic shapes, you can build more and more complex items by
simply adding simpler ones to each other. Say, for example, that you want to
create a World War I biplane model so that you can add a bunch of them to
some former French field in Google Earth. Well, biplanes tended to be rather
boxy and pretty simple in design, so they’re not too much trouble to do —
until you get to the most difficult part: the airplane’s wings. You could just go
with a simple balsa wood glider style and make a flat wing. If you want more
realism, though, a true wing is a special shape called an airfoil, which is flat
on the bottom but curved on the top. This shape is what causes the wing to
provide lift; without that, a plane just doesn’t get off the ground.
So, how do you create this more challenging shape? Follow along as I show
you step by step:
1. Click the Front icon on the Views toolbar.
2. Select the Line tool in the Drawing toolbar.
3. Draw a line to become the base of the wing, as shown in Figure 13-2.
The specific dimensions aren’t important in this exercise.
4. Select the Arc tool in the Drawing toolbar.
5. Click the left edge of the line to set the arc’s first end point (see 
Figure 13-3).

6. Click the right edge of the line to set the arc’s second end point (see
Figure 13-4).
7. Move the mouse pointer upward.
As you do so, a curved line shows you the current shape of the arc
you’re creating (see Figure 13-5).
8. When the arc’s curvature is satisfactory to you, click to finish it.

9. Click the Iso icon on the Views toolbar.
10. Select the Push/Pull tool in the Getting Started toolbar.
11. Click in the center of the two-dimensional wing pattern. While holding
down the mouse button, move the Push/Pull tool to the side (either
side will do).
The shape follows the tool and extrudes from its flat state into a wing
shape (see Figure 13-6).

Part IV: Advanced Features 

Designing with the Offset Tool
The Offset tool is kind of specialized. It makes a copy of a shape and moves it
either inward or outward from the original. This might not sound too exciting
at first, but it saves you a lot of time and trouble when you need to replicate a
pattern. This is a common technique in both art and architecture, from the
frame around a painting to the eaves around a building’s roof.
For this example, I show you how to use the Offset tool to help create a regu-
lation archery target — without having to manually redraw an endless series
of circles.
1. Click the Top icon on the Views toolbar.
2. Select the Circle tool in the Drawing toolbar.
3. Click to set the center point of the circle.
4. While holding down the mouse button, drag it outward a little bit and
then release the mouse button.
5. Type 12" as the radius. This value appears in the Value Control Box at
the lower right side of the screen.
Because the radius is half of the diameter, this creates a regulation target
size of 24", as shown in Figure 13-7.
You don’t have to click in the Value Control Box to activate it before you
type values in Google SketchUp — whatever you type while creating an
object automatically goes into the Value Control Box.

6. Select the Offset tool in the Modification toolbar.
7. Click the edge of the circle.
A copy of the circle appears. If you move your mouse pointer in or out,
the copy follows your movements.
8. Move the copy inside the original circle (see Figure 13-8).

9. Type 1.2".
This sets the offset at the regulation size for the rings of a regulation
archery target.
10. Click the edge of the inner copy and repeat Steps 8 and 9 to make the
second ring. Continue this process with each succeeding circle copy
until you create ten rings in all (the bull’s-eye being the last), as
shown in Figure 13-9.
11. Select the Paint Bucket icon.
12. Use the Paint Bucket tool on the Getting Started toolbar to apply a 
texture of Colors in the following manner:
• White: Outer two rings
• Black: Third and fourth rings
• Blue: Fifth and sixth rings
• Red: Seventh and eighth rings
• Yellow: Ninth and tenth rings
Your target should look like the one in Figure 13-10.

Chapter 13: Creating Polygons and Other Complex Structures

Creating Polygons
A polygon is a many-sided figure (see Figure 13-11). Any closed shape with
three or more sides (you can’t possibly close a shape with fewer sides) can
be generated in Google SketchUp.

There is a practical limitation, however. Simpler shapes, such as triangles or
pentagons, are very distinctive. As you add more sides, though, all polygons
tend to look like circles. Figure 13-12 shows a circle next to a polygon with
100 sides.
This circularizing effect begins to become apparent after a polygon has
approximately ten sides (a decagon). Table 13-1 shows the names for several
of the common polygons.

Making a simple polygon
Take a look at how to make a polygon in Google SketchUp:
1. Click the Top icon on the Views toolbar.
2. Select the Polygon tool in the Drawing toolbar.
3. Click to set the center point of the polygon.
4. Move your mouse pointer outward.
As you do so, the size of the polygon changes in response to your action
(see Figure 13-13).
It doesn’t matter at this point how many sides the polygon has; I show
you how to set that next.
5. When you’re satisfied with the size, click to set it.
6. (Optional) If you want a different number of sides, enter the number
of sides you want, followed by an s (with no space between the
number and the s), and then press Enter.
For instance, say that you just drew an octagon but really want a trian-
gle. Just type 3s and then press Enter.
The figure instantly changes to a three-sided one, as shown in Figure 13-14.
Figure 13-13:

230
Part IV: Advanced Features 

Of course, if you want a pentagon, type 5s instead, 6s for a hexagon, and
so forth.
Making an arrowhead
I’ll wrap this chapter up with a more complex example before moving on to
the really fancy stuff in the next one. As long as I’m on an archery theme, why
not make a four-pointed arrowhead? It’s easy to do in Google SketchUp —
just a couple of triangles, after all — but, in the process, I’ll fill you in on a few
more tips and tricks that’ll stand you in good stead on your later projects.
This example starts with the triangle that I created in the preceding exercise.
(If you didn’t do it, just back up a page or so — you can catch up in a minute.)
1. Select the Push/Pull tool in the Getting Started toolbar.
You can find this tool in the Modification toolbar as well.
2. Click the triangle and move your mouse pointer upward a little bit.
3. Type 0.1mm and then press Enter.
This makes the triangle three-dimensional although it is now a blade of
razor sharpness (see Figure 13-15).
Figure 13-14:
Set the

231
Chapter 13: Creating Polygons and Other Complex Structures

Before moving on to the next steps, you need to select the blade.
However, what you and I think of as one three-dimensional figure is 
actually composed of several elements (every line and the space
between lines are individual parts of the whole — see the next chapter
for details), and you need to select them all at once. There are two ways
to do this, depending upon what you have on your screen (assuming
that you have followed these steps religiously, there should be nothing
else there but, if you’re the sort of person who likes to experiment, you
may have several items on screen right now).
• If that blade is the only thing there, all you have to do is press
Ctrl+A. This automatically selects everything in Google SketchUp.
• If you have other objects besides the blade, click the Selection icon.
If you press Ctrl+A, the other objects would be selected as well,
which is probably not desirable.
4. Click above and to the side of the blade. Hold down the mouse button
and drag your pointer all the way across and down so that you draw a
box around it, as shown in Figure 13-16.
5. Release the mouse button.
The entire range of elements that was within the box is now selected,
but nothing else is. Here’s how to solve that problem once and for all.
Figure 13-15:
Make a thin

6. Take all these disparate parts (the lines and faces that make up the
developing arrowhead) and make them into one unit by choosing
Edit➪Make Group from the menu.
Now — and from now on — all the parts will move together. In the next
step, we will use this feature to make an exact copy.
7. Select the Move/Copy tool in the Getting Started toolbar.
8. Hold down the Ctrl key to turn on the Copy function and then click
the blade.
9. While holding down the mouse button, drag a copy of the blade to the
side, far enough away that the original and the copy are not in contact
(see Figure 13-17).
In the next steps, I show you how to rotate one so that they are at right
angles to one another.
10. Switch to Front view by clicking the Front icon.
11. Select the Rotate tool in the Modification toolbar and move it over one
of the blades.
A protractor appears, as shown in Figure 13-18. As you move the mouse
pointer over different parts of the blade, various names appear, such as
Endpoint in Group or Midpoint of Group.

12. Click the two rear endpoints of the blade.

Now it’s time to bring the two blades together.

n this final chapter on Google SketchUp, I dig into some of the more fasci-
nating things you can do when creating three-dimensional models. Despite
the fact that the program mainly works with flat surfaces, I can show you a few
tricks — such as text callouts and dimensional markings — to bring to the
party that will allow you to go way beyond using simple right angles in your
work. Before starting these tutorials, make sure that you have the following
toolbars activated:
 Views
 Drawing
 Getting Started
 Modification

To activate a toolbar, choose View➪Toolbars from the menu and then choose
the toolbar name.

Slicing and Extruding a Stairway
Assuming that you use Google SketchUp (at least occasionally) to make
house models, you might want to include a stairway. As with most actions in
this program, you’ll be working with rectangular shapes to do so. (See later
sections for creating fancier shapes.)
To make a stairway with the Push/Pull tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Iso view on the Views toolbar.
2. Select the Rectangle tool on the Drawing toolbar.
3. Click to set the first corner of the rectangle and then drag the pointer
until the rectangle is of sufficient size, as shown in Figure 14-1. Then
release the mouse button.
4. Click the Push/Pull tool in the Getting Started toolbar.
5. Click the rectangle and move the mouse pointer upward to extrude it
(see Figure 14-2).
6. Click the Line tool in the Drawing toolbar.
7. Click the left side of the extruded rectangle to set the start point for
the line.
8. Click the right side to set the end point.
The result looks like Figure 14-3.

Understanding Lines and Faces
It’s time for some technical stuff about these figures I’ve been showing you.
Everything you’ve been doing in the earlier chapters on Google SketchUp is
composed of two basic elements: lines and faces. A line is, well, a line, plain
and simple. When you work with figures like a rectangle, however, the area
between those four lines isn’t empty. Rather, it’s filled by the face, just like
how glass in a picture frame fills the area inside it (see Figure 14-8).
Figure 14-7:
Complete
the
stairway.
Figure 14-6:
Add steps.
241
Chapter 14: Digging Deeper with Google SketchUp

Lines and faces behave very differently from one another, and altering them
can have a powerful impact on your modeling. You can gain an intuitive feel
for the difference between the ways they act by doing the following exercise:
1. Select the Iso view on the Views toolbar.
2. Select the Rectangle tool on the Drawing toolbar.
3. Click to set the first corner of the rectangle and then drag the pointer
until the rectangle is of sufficient size, as shown in Figure 14-9. Finally,
release the mouse button.
4. Click the Push/Pull tool in the Getting Started toolbar.
5. Click the rectangle and move the mouse pointer upward to extrude it
(see Figure 14-10).
6. Click the Move/Copy tool in the Getting Started toolbar.
7. Click any face in the rectangle; while holding down the mouse button,
move the pointer.
The results are exactly the same as using the Push/Pull tool — the face
extrudes in the direction in which it is moved.
The Move/Copy tool works this way only with three-dimensional shapes.
If you try this with a two-dimensional rectangle, you simply move the
whole thing — not extrude the face.
Figure 14-8:
Lines
surround
faces.
242
Part IV: Advanced Features 

8. Now comes the fun part. Click any line and repeat the moves you used
in Step 7 for faces.
The exact shape you create varies, depending upon which line you pick
and in what direction you move it. Figure 14-11 shows one possible result.
Figure 14-10:
Make it 3-D.
Figure 14-9:

243
Chapter 14: Digging Deeper with Google SketchUp

9. Click the Undo icon (or press Ctrl+Z) as many times as necessary to
return to the basic solid rectangle. Then try moving different faces
and different lines in different ways.
Figure 14-12 shows several possible results that all started as simple
extruded rectangles.
Repeat this step until you feel comfortable modifying your models 
this way.
Figure 14-12:
Some
examples of

rectangles.
Figure 14-11:
Moving
lines can be
dramatic.
244
Part IV: Advanced Features 

Think of it this way: When you extrude or move a face, the attached lines
follow along. When you move a line, however, it is the faces that follow along.
The first method allows for nothing more dramatic than extending things at
right angles to one another. The second, however, lets you create any kind of
angle you want, helping you to create sharp corners, sloping ramps, or even
twisted creations that would confuse M.C. Escher himself.
The Follow Me Tool
The Follow Me tool might seem oddly named at first, but you’ll soon see just
exactly how apt it is. When you want to add something like a projecting eave
to an existing figure, the Follow Me tool allows you to drag it along the edge
of that figure — the new element follows your mouse cursor as you do so.
1. Select the Iso view on the Views toolbar.
2. Select the Rectangle tool on the Drawing toolbar.
3. Click to set the first corner of the rectangle, drag the pointer until 
the rectangle is of sufficient size (as shown in Figure 14-13), and then
release the mouse button.
4. Click the Push/Pull tool on the Getting Started toolbar.
5. Click the rectangle and move the mouse pointer upward to extrude it.
(You know the drill by now.)
6. Click one of the upper corners of the extruded rectangle and then
draw a small rectangle, as shown in Figure 14-14.

245
Chapter 14: Digging Deeper with Google SketchUp

7. Click the Follow Me tool on the Modification toolbar.
8. Click the edge of the 3-D rectangle and drag the mouse pointer around
the first two sides.
The line you are following turns red as you do so, and the smaller rec-
tangle is subtracted from the larger one, as shown in Figure 14-15.

9. When you reach the endpoint of the second side, click.
The completed figure is shown in Figure 14-16.
Note that this example used a shape that was within the boundaries of the
extruded rectangle, which is why it was subtracted from the shape. If you use
the Follow Me tool with an intersecting shape that starts outside the bound-
aries instead, the resulting shape is added to the original one (see Figure 14-17).

Lathing a Polygon
The Follow Me tool can be very useful in working with flat surfaces, but it has
a very special feature as well — unlike the Push/Pull tool, you can use it to
create some very complex curved surfaces. The method for doing so involves
creating a flat base shape and then sweeping it around in a circle, resulting in
a three-dimensional version. This technique is also called lathing because it
produces results similar to those of a wood lathe.
If it sounds like a complicated operation, don’t worry. The user interface in
Google SketchUp makes it easy, and it’s reasonably similar to the normal way
to use the Follow Me tool:
1. Select the Top view on the Views toolbar.
2. Select the Circle tool on the Drawing toolbar.
3. Click to set the center point of the circle, drag the pointer until the
circle is the size you desire, and then release the mouse button. (See
Figure 14-18.)
4. Click the Front icon on the Views toolbar.
5. Click the Polygon tool on the Drawing toolbar.
6. Click the left edge of the circle to set the center point of the polygon,
as shown in Figure 14-19.

Figure 14-20; then click to set the size.

12. Click the rim of the circle next to the octagon and drag the mouse
pointer around the circle (which turns red to assist you — you can
even see it when it’s behind something).
As you do so, the octagon follows the pointer around the circle, as
shown in Figure 14-21.
13. Continue to circle the rim until you come all the way around and the
octagonal shape sweeps around the entire circle (see Figure 14-22).

As you can see, the shape is vastly more complex than the run-of-the-mill 
rectangular or cylindrical solids. The exact nature of the resulting three-
dimensional shape, of course, depends upon several factors:
 The shape of the original two-dimensional figure
 The size of the circle about which it is swept
 Its exact placement on that circle
Varying any of these points creates a different shape.
Setting Leader Text
You’ve probably noticed that some of the figures in this book include text 
callouts — brief descriptions of things like toolbar icons with a line indicating
where the named item is found. They can be very helpful in communicating
exactly what is where. Google SketchUp lets you add callouts, also called
leader text, to your own creations as well.
Here’s how it’s done:
1. Click the Text icon in the Construction toolbar.
2. Click the point you want the text to refer to.
3. Move the mouse pointer to where you want to place the text.
As you do so, the leader line extends from the point you choose in Step
2 and follows the movement of the pointer (see Figure 14-23).

leader line.

4. Click to set the text location.
An editable text box appears at that location, as shown in Figure 14-24.
By default, some text is already in the text box, depending upon the
object you clicked in Step 2. Usually, this is one of the measurements 
of some element of the object. Simply ignore it.
5. Type your text into the text box; then click outside the text box 
(or press Enter twice).
The results should look something like Figure 14-25.
To edit existing text, click the Select icon and then double-click the text on
screen. The text box opens, and the text within can be edited just like when
you first created it.

Understanding the Tape Measure 
and Dimension Tools
Two tools measure dimensions in Google SketchUp. The Tape Measure and
Dimension tools are very similar, but they have slightly different purposes:
 Tape Measure: The Tape Measure tool is used just like you use a physical
tape measure from your toolbox — to get a momentary idea of exactly
how long an object on your screen is.
 Dimension: The Dimension tool is kind of a blend of the Tape Measure
and Text tools. Like the Tape Measure tool, it gets the length of an
object; like the Text tool, it lets you mark that measurement much as
leader text is used.
Follow along and you’ll quickly get the hang of it. Tackle the Tape Measure
tool first:
1. Select the Iso view on the Views toolbar.
2. Select the Rectangle tool on the Drawing toolbar.
3. Click to set the first corner of the rectangle, drag the pointer to set the
opposite corner, and then release the mouse button.
4. After you have something to measure, select the Tape Measure tool on
the Construction toolbar.
5. Click at the point where you want to begin the measurement.
6. Move the Tape Measure to the end point of your measurement.
The metaphor for Steps 5 and 6 is precisely as if you were actually using
a tape measure in real life. As you move the pointer, a line extends from
the starting point. When you pause in your movement, the current
length of that line is shown (see Figure 14-26).
7. When you’re done measuring, click.
The “tape” automatically “rewinds.”
8. Click the Dimensions tool on the Construction toolbar.
9. Click one corner of the rectangle to set the start point for the 
measurement.
10. Move the pointer and click another corner to set the end point 
(see Figure 14-27).
253
Chapter 14: Digging Deeper with Google SketchUp

11. Move the pointer away from the rectangle.
As you do so, a set of dimensioning lines with the length displayed in the
middle follows the pointer (see Figure 14-28).

hapter 15 shows you where to go when you need to
find out where something is. These ten sites will give
you the latitudes and longitudes of just about any place
you can imagine.
Chapter 16 tells you where to find those external data files

map images to ecological data that you can add to Google
Earth.
Chapter 17 turns you on to some things you’ll want to

Chapter 15
Ten Great Places to 
Get Coordinates
I
n this chapter, I take a look at ten Web sites that are useful for finding loca-
tions of both famed and obscure places around the world. Each site has its
own purpose and method of searching. One, for example, might be geared
toward pilots and another toward astronomers, but all provide you with the
information you need to track down locations for use in Google Earth.
As great as Google Earth is, it can’t anticipate what’s important to everyone
on Earth, so here I give you a hodgepodge of Web sites that are dedicated 
to helping you find anything, even if it’s not already in the Google Earth data-
base. Each of these ten sites provides differing ways of showing where some-
thing exists on the Earth, without you needing to already know what the
latitude/longitude of the objects in question are. Each site has its own dis-
tinct user base. For example, Google Earth Community core members tend 
to be older and professional users (pilots, geographers, teachers, and so on),
but something like Google Earth Hacks (GEH) has a younger user base that
isn’t as focused on forums and discussion. Aliensview is similar in its user
base to GEH.
You’ll find, somewhere among these dozen-minus-two sites, not only one 
that you’ll want to use every day but the backups that you’ll need when your
favorite site just doesn’t have the info you need. Somewhere, though, among
the Web sites in this chapter, you can find the exact location of nearly every
place on Earth.
You can find a ready-made list of interesting locations to look for in Appendix C.
Aliensview Sightseeing
Aliensview Sightseeing is literally made for Google Earth users. Although 
its database is not as comprehensive as some, it meshes nicely with Google
Earth because it is designed to. The locales revealed in its searches can be
opened automatically in Google Earth.

Here’s how to get your bearings:
1. Go to www.aliensview.com.
2. In the menu on the left side of the page (see Figure 15-1), click the
Search option (located between Donate and New Entries).
3. In the resulting Search Engine page, as shown in Figure 15-2, enter the
name of the location you’re looking for in the Keywords text box.

4. (Optional) Click the Category drop-down lists to specify the type of
thing you’re hunting.
Categories include Buildings, Military, Sports, and so on. After you choose
a category, the Options drop-down list becomes active as well. For 
example, if you choose Buildings, you also gain options such as Castles,
Factories, and Skyscrapers to help you limit your search still further.
5. You can do the same thing with the Continent and Country options to
further narrow your search.
For instance, if you’re looking for Paris, Texas (not Paris, France), you
can use these options to skip past the better-known city in Europe.
6. (Optional) Limit the search by checking the user rating of the locale
(popularity ratings by the registered users of Aliensview). To do this:
a. Click the first Rating drop-down list and choose either At Least or 
At Most
b. Click the second Rating drop-down list and choose a rating from 
1 to 5, 1 being the lowest.
7. If you want to see a map of the search result, select the Show Results
in a Map check box.
8. Click the Search button.
The instructions on the resulting page are in German (see Figure 15-3),
but the links are usually in English.
9. Click the desired link. (In this example, I chose Notre Dame de Paris.)

10. When the link opens, scroll down beneath the image to where it reads
Eintrag downloaden und in Google Earth öffnen (which means
Download this entry and open it in Google Earth) and click that.
If you click the Open button in the resulting dialog box, Google Earth
opens at that location (as in Figure 15-4). If you choose Save, you can
store the KML file for later viewing.
You can find this file in the Temporary Places folder in your Places pane.
When you exit Google Earth, you are asked whether you want the file
moved to My Places. Clicking Yes will mean the location is permanently
added; clicking No deletes it.
After you find what you’re looking for, take the time to click the other links to
explore the other locations offered here.
Lat-Long.com
The site at Lat-Long.com has information for U.S. locations only, but if that’s
what you’re looking for, it’s one of the best. It offers a fast search function if
you’re in a hurry as well as the capability to click your way through the
browse option if you feel like exploring.

To use the search function, follow these steps:
1. Take your Web browser to www.lat-long.com.
2. In the Location Name text box, type the name of the place you’re 
looking for (see Figure 15-5).
3. Choose which state to look in from the State drop-down list.
4. (Optional) Enter a name in the County text box.
5. If you wish to limit the search by the kind of place you’re hunting,
choose one of the options in the Feature Type drop-down list (Airport,
Church, Geyser, School, Stream, and so on).
6. Click the Lat-Long Search button.
7. On the resulting Web page, click the desired link.
This opens a final results page (see Figure 15-6) on which the latitude
and longitude are listed in both minutes and decimal forms.
At Lat-Long.com, as with all databases, you can find some surprising gaps.
For example, if you search for Cape Hatteras in North Carolina and you spec-
ify the Feature Type as Cape, you get nothing. However, if you search for it
with the Feature Type set to Search All, you will find it.

If you’d rather browse features by state, here’s how:
1. On the main Lat-Long.com page, scroll down beneath the search form
and click the name of the state you want to browse through.
The resulting page (see Figure 15-7) lists features by Location Type, such
as Airport, Bay, and so on.
2. Click the location type you want.

fallingrain.com
This excellent Web site is aimed at a target market of pilots. Therefore, it
includes a lot more information than just locations — average cloud cover,
nearest alternative airports where you can land in an emergency — that sort
of thing. It lacks a search feature, so you must browse manually. However, 
its database of longitude and latitude information is the tops, and it includes
maps as well, so you can be absolutely sure that you’re not getting some
other place that just has the same name as the one you’re looking for.
To find out what’s where, follow these steps:
1. Point your browser to www.fallingrain.com/world.
2. Click the name of the country you want to look in.
This takes you to a Regions list (essentially, states, provinces, and so on).
3. Click the region. Depending upon the number of entries in that
region, you might need to choose the beginning letters from one 
further page as well.
Nota bene (note well, as they used to say back in Rome) that the location
names are the native ones — not your native language, but that of the
people who live there. If you’re looking for a place in a Spanish-speaking
country, you’d better know how they say it there, and if you’re looking
for a city in Russia, you’d better know the word gorod for city.
The resulting Web page (see Figure 15-8) lists all the cities in the region,
along with their latitude and longitude in decimal format. You can simply
copy the info from here and paste it into Google Earth’s search box.
Figure 15-8:

Chapter 15: Ten Great Places to Get Coordinates

Clicking one of the city links provides you with a much more detailed
page, including weather info and maps of the area. On this page, latitude
and longitude are given in decimal form in the first line, and the same
values on the second line are given in degrees, minutes, and seconds.
Either can be used in Google Earth.
NASA WorldWind
NASA WorldWind is a program similar to Google Earth although in my opin-
ion, it’s destined to be less popular. Face it: Google understands the popular
psyche a lot better than some government agency does. Regardless, its users,
like those of Google Earth, do their fair share of exploring the planet and
sharing their findings with others.
To dig into the NASA WorldWind database of interesting locales, do this:
1. Go to www.worldwindcentral.com/hotspots.
2. To search for a location, enter its name in the Search text box on the
left side of the Web page (see Figure 15-9) and then click Search.
3. On the resulting page, click the link for any item of interest.
This takes you to a detail page with an image of the location.

them all. (You can do this from any page, not just the home page.) Click
anything you like to get a nice set of thumbnail images complete with 
latitude and longitude (see Figure 15-10).
World Gazetteer
The World Gazetteer site is geared toward population figures and can be a bit
confusing at first, but it’s well worth it when you need to track down the coor-
dinates for a place. Just follow the steps carefully, and you’ll be happy you did.
To find something:
1. Fire up your Web browser and go to www.world-gazetteer.com.
2. Click the Search Tools link at the top of the page.
This takes you to a new page where you have the option of either using 
a search engine or browsing alphabetically (see Figure 15-11).
3. To use the search engine, click the small Search link near the upper-
left corner.

4. In the resulting text box, enter the name of the location you are
searching for and then click the Search For a Geographical Entity
button.
To browse the alphabetical listings instead, return to the search tools
page and click the first letter of the location’s name. This takes you to 
a new list like the one in Figure 15-12, and you do the same thing here,
gradually narrowing down the list until you find what you want.

How Far Is It?
Strictly speaking, How Far Is It? is just another longitude/latitude lookup tool.
Its primary purpose is to provide the distance between two points on the 
surface of the Earth. You enter the names of both places, and it gives you not
only the distance between them but also the latitude and longitude of each.
However, entering the second location is optional. If you enter only one place
name, — you guessed it — you get the latitude and longitude for just that
one, so you can use this tool to find a location’s coordinates even if you don’t
care how far it is from anything.
To go locating:
1. Head to www.indo.com/cgi-bin/dist.
2. Scroll down until you see the form shown in Figure 15-13.
3. Enter the location’s name in the From text box and then click the Look
It Up! button.
If there is only one possible answer — say, Russiaville, Indiana — it
shows up on the result page. If the name wasn’t specific enough — 
say, Paris — you get a Please Clarify result page, which lists the various
possibilities. Simply scroll down the list until you find the right one; the
latitude and longitude information are right there.

Heavens Above
Heavens Above specializes in astronomy, but it’s one of those places that
Google Earth-ers will want to drop in on for its database of terrestrial loca-
tions. It’s a bit of an odd combination of browsing and searching, with the
search being limited to one country at a time.
Jump right in:
1. Surf to www.heavens-above.com/countries.asp.
2. Click the name of the country you’re interested in (see Figure 15-14).
3. In the Search String text box on the next page, enter the name of the
place you’re looking for and then click the Submit button.
You can use wild cards with the Heavens Above search engine. For exam-
ple, you can use a question mark (?) to take the place of any one letter
or an asterisk (*) for any amount of letters. Thus, if you look for ay??s in
France, you would find Aymas, Aynes, and Ayros. Comparatively, if you
use ay*s, you would get nearly a dozen responses.
The results page shows all matching locations along with their latitude
and longitude.

If you ever wondered where your tax dollars go to, this is one of the few
delightful answers. The United States Census Bureau has a gazetteer 
(geographic index) online that you can use for free. Of course, it’s limited 
to locations in the U.S. and its territories, but within those limits, it’s about 
as concise and comprehensive as gazetteers get.
Here’s what you need to do:
1. Go to www.census.gov/cgi-bin/gazetteer.
2. Enter the location’s name in — you guessed it — the Name text box
(see Figure 15-15).
If you want to do a nationwide search, don’t enter anything else. If you
want to limit the search to a particular state, enter its two-letter postal
code in the State text box. To further narrow things down, you can also
specify a ZIP code.

ity to specify the altitude of a location.
To see what it can do, follow these steps:
1. Go to http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic.
2. Enter the location’s name in the Feature Name text box (see 
Figure 15-16).
3. To limit your search to one state, choose one from the State or
Territory drop-down list. You can also enter the name of the county 
in the County text box.
4. To look for a specific type of geographic feature (such as an airport, a
geyser, and so on), choose one from the Feature Class drop-down list.
5. To specify the altitude of the location, click the Elevation drop-down
list and choose from these relationships: Between, Equals, Higher
Than, or Lower Than. Next, enter a value in the Elevation text box 
and then select either the Feet or the Meters radio button.

W
hen it comes to getting your hands on digital data, you often find that
you have to go to a lot of trouble, and the expense can be a bit much
for a noncommercial budget. Fortunately, more and more Geographical
Information System (GIS) information is becoming available online — and a
lot of it is available for free!
WebGIS
The folks at WebGIS offer three types of digital data for free download: ter-
rain, land use/land cover, and digital line. The first is in the form of standard
Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and the latter two categories contain ArcView
shapefiles (.shp format).
Here’s how to download the files:
1. Go to www.webgis.com.
2. Click one of the links on the left side (see Figure 16-1) to choose the
type of digital file you wish to download.
For this example, follow the U.S. terrain data.
3. When a map of the United States appears, click the state you want.
The map changes to the selected state.

FreeGIS.org
FreeGIS.org is dedicated to helping you find anything and everything that’s both
free and related to GIS (no kidding). In addition to the digital data that I discuss
here, FreeGIS.org has items to help everyone from software developers to those
of us who, from time to time, need to convert one file format to another.
It’s worth taking a bit of time to explore the site, but for now, time to get back
to why you’re here:
1. Go to http://freegis.org/database.
2. Click the Geodata link (see Figure 16-11).

Global Elevation Data
One of the things the Space Shuttle did while floating around “up there” was
to use radar to check out the elevations of every part of Earth. This was the
famed Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, which you can read about at
http://srtm.usgs.gov. The data from that mission is freely available, and
here’s how to get it for yourself:
1. To download US data, go to
ftp://e0srp01u.ecs.nasa.gov/srtm/version2/SRTM1
To download data for the rest of the world, go to 
ftp://e0srp01u.ecs.nasa.gov/srtm/version2/SRTM3
2. For the U.S. version, click the number of the region you want (see
Figure 16-12).

Ten Cool Tools
A
s great as Google Earth is, it can’t do everything. Plenty of tools are
available to round out your Google Earth experience, however, from
image enhancement and file format converters to utilities that link Google
Earth to other servers.
IrfanView
This handy little graphics utility offers a slough of features in a simple, easy
to use package. Although it’s no competitor for high-powered paint programs
like Photoshop or Fireworks, it has all the essentials for rapidly manipulating
or enhancing the images you save from Google Earth:
 Gamma correction
 Rotate or flip image
 Crop image
 Resize/resample
 Increase/decrease color depth
 Contrast and brightness
 File format conversion (a particularly important feature because Google
Earth only saves images in JPEG format)
In addition to all this, IrfanView (as shown in Figure 17-1) has multi-language
support, a built-in set of filters, and the ability to utilize Photoshop-compliant
filters as well.
Get your copy at www.irfanview.com. It’s free for noncommercial users
and costs only $12 for commercial purposes.

Arc2Earth
An awful lot of geographical data is available in ESRI’s popular ArcGIS format.
If you want to use it in Google Earth, of course, you have to convert it to KML.
A number of utilities are available for doing so, but Arc2Earth is the one gen-
erating all the excitement.
Arc2Earth doesn’t just move a map from one program to another: It has a
wonderful selection of options that can enhance your presentations. Its 3-D
extrusion function, for example, enables you to make parts of the map jut out
from the ground, thus turning a plain map with some linked non-geographical
data (such as population figures, poll results, and so on) into a three-dimen-
sional display like the one shown in Figure 17-2.
This program also has good support for label creation, marker symbols, and
polygons. It can also create and link Google Earth pop-up information bal-
loons. You can download it at
www.spatialdatalogic.com/cs/blogs/brian_flood/archive/2005/09/12/98.aspx

$99–$299.
Juice Analytics Census Files
The Census layer in Google Earth has a minimum of information about each
county: population, median income, and per capita income. The U.S. Census
Bureau, however, has a lot more than that to share. The folks at Juice
Analytics are developing .kmz files that contain some of this information.
The Census layer is under US Government in the Layers pane, which does not
show up if you have only the Core Layers selected. You have to choose All
Layers view to see it.
The data, which is available for both counties and block groups, is currently
limited to
 Population density
 Median age
 Male/female ratio
Just point your Web browser to

Juice Analytics Geocoding Tool
While I’m on the subject of the nice folks at Juice Analytics, they also have a
geocoding tool. (See Chapter 2 for more information on geocoding.)
This utilizes Microsoft Excel (see Figure 17-4) to convert a list of addresses
into latitude and longitude values and then export them as maps for Google
Earth. It performs this task by querying either Yahoo! or geocode.us for the
location data, which it then converts to a .kml file and exports to the Google
Earth Temporary Places folder.
To get your copy, head on over to
www.juiceanalytics.com/weblog/?p=158
Just like the Census data files, this is a freebie.

MyFsGoogleEarth - Link Google Earth
with Flight Simulator (FS2004, FS9)
I suppose this was kind of inevitable — that someone would think of a way to
link up Google Earth and Microsoft’s Flight Simulator. MyFsGoogleEarth is a
Web server that does just that. This clever little application allows you to see
the plane in flight in real time, along with its expected location in one minute
as well as the AI (artificial intelligence) traffic flying near it (see Figure 17-5).

KML2X3D - Google Earth 
to Web 3D Converter
X3D used to be called VRML, and it’s a standard for displaying three-
dimensional objects on Web pages. Whereas Arc2Earth converts ArcGIS files
into Google Earth formats, KML2X3D changes Google Earth files into X3D.
This allows Webmasters to utilize the ever-growing number of 3-D models
designed for Google Earth on their own Web pages. (See Chapter 12 for more
information on Google Earth models.) This is yet another free program for
Google Earth users, and this one even has the source code available under
the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL).
Take your Web browser to www.mediamachines.com/KML2X3D (see 
Figure 17-6) and check out this program.

EarthPlot and EarthPaint
EarthPlot (see Figure 17-7) is a honey of a program. It can import ASCII data
and read Excel files. It generates several kinds of maps including post and
raster image. Perhaps most impressive, however, is EarthPlot’s ability to snag
input from the Microsoft TerraServer and import it into Google Earth.

EarthPaint is, as you might have guessed, a paint program. Unlike others,
however, it interfaces with Google Earth, bringing the current image in the
viewing area into EarthPaint. You then draw whatever you have in mind and
export the new image back into Google Earth as an overlay.
The limited-feature trial versions can be downloaded at www.earthplot
software.com. The fully functional version of EarthPlot costs $29.95, and
EarthPaint goes for $14.95. While you’re there, you might as well grab the free
program EarthShape, which creates polygons for use in Google Earth.
Google Earth Hacks Image Overlays
Your average overlay isn’t particularly exciting, but these people have come up
with some real stunners. The maps of the ancient Earth alone (see Figure 17-8)
are worth the visit, and there is a lot of more up-to-date material as well, such
as Hurricane Katrina and Iraq overlays.
You can browse their image overlays by category, such as Real-time Traffic
and Weather: Forecasts, or by country. The URL is

GPS Utility
If you use Google Earth with a GPS (Global Positioning System) device, you’ll
probably want to check out this nice add-on (see Chapter 9 for more on work-
ing with GPS devices). It can import and export in Google Earth’s native file
format. Although Google Earth cannot currently export to GPS devices, this
utility can provide a bridge between them.
The GPS Utility Web page is located at www.gpsu.co.uk. The free trial ver-
sion is limited in the number of waypoints and such that it can process, but
the full version’s top end is 65,000. The registration fee is $55.
GE-Path and GE-Graph
GE-Path, as shown in Figure 17-9, puts Google Earth paths on steroids (see
Chapter 3 for more on paths). You can import Google Earth files into it and
then monkey with the paths in many ways. You can, for example, add the lati-
tude and longitude coordinates to each point in the path, find the distance
between each point and the bearing from one to the other, and link the end
point to the starting point.
Figure 17-9:
GE-Path
puts paths

297
Chapter 17: Ten Cool Tools

The whole shebang can then be exported back into Google Earth, or you can
choose from a variety of other file formats.
GE-Graph (see Figure 17-10) creates graphs from Google Earth data, allowing
you to set different options based on the data appended to a placemark, such
as a different color or a larger size than the other placemarks. It can also
import and export data with other programs like Microsoft Excel.

Appendixes

In this part . . .
H
ere’s a collection of odds and ends that you’ll want
to dig into. Appendix A is a glossary of the book’s
technical terms as well as explanations of the various file
formats that you can either import into or export from the
program. Appendix B is a reference that shows you all 
the default layers in Google Earth. Appendix C gives your
Earth exploration a kickstart by guiding you to some of
the more interesting places on the planet.

Appendix A
Glossary
3D Buildings layer: A layer within Google Earth that supplies a more realistic
view of cities by adding models of major buildings. This is currently available
for only the largest and most populous locations.
anisotropic filtering: A technique for softening the harsh edges along the
horizon when you tilt the image onscreen. It’s very memory intensive, so go
for this only if you have 32MB of video RAM or better.
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange): A standard
for encoding text. ASCII files are the simplest kind of plain text files and can
be imported and exported by virtually any program.
AVI: Microsoft Audio/Video Interleave movie format. Makes very large 
movie files.
bandwidth: The total amount of information that a network connection can
transmit. The higher the bandwidth, the more data that can be sent over the
connection in the same amount of time. A dialup modem, for example, has a
much lower bandwidth than a DSL line.
base map: The simplest part of Google Earth. This is nothing more than the
most basic imagery and spatial coordinate information: in other words, just
the map with no frills. Layers, overlays, and such are placed upon the base
map to generate more complex and informative displays.
bearing: The direction from a specific location to another destination or
object, generally expressed in terms of compass points. (That is, “North” is
zero degrees.)
BMP: The older Windows bitmap format. Although it is lossless — that is, the
file that it saves is identical to the current image, down to the last pixel, when
it’s redisplayed — it lacks any form of compression and therefore creates
extremely large files.
border: The dividing line between political entities on a map. Also sometimes
referred to as boundary or limit.

cache: An area for temporary data storage. Caching data saves time and
bandwidth because the client doesn’t have to ask the server for the same
information over and over again but can access it locally instead.
camera: Your viewpoint when you look at a scene. The metaphor results from
thinking of the image onscreen as being taken by a camera that is at a partic-
ular altitude and location, aimed in a certain direction.
check box: A method of setting optional values, represented by a small,
hollow square. A check box that is blank is not selected. When it is selected,
it has a check mark inside. Check boxes are used for nonconflicting options.
client/server: Two computers in a relationship in which one makes a request
of the other and the second fulfills the request. When using Google Earth,
your computer is the client, and Google is the server.
compass: The circular ring in the upper-right corner that indicates which
direction is north.
CSV: Comma-Separated Value. These files are perhaps the most commonly
used method of moving tabular database information from one program to
another. Such a list consists of values that are separated by a delimiter, which
is a character that isn’t used in any of the values themselves so that it’s obvi-
ous where one value ends and another begins. Despite the name of the
format, that character isn’t always a comma, and Google Earth can import
both comma-delimited and tab-delimited versions.
default settings: The settings that Google Earth comes with. In most cases,
you can alter the default values in order to customize the program.
detail area: The amount of space in the center of the viewing area where
maximum screen resolution is applied. The smaller the detail area, the lower
the demands on your system but the less appealing the overall image.
DGN: MicroStation Geographical Information System (GIS) format.
Digital Elevation Model (DEM): A type of file containing geographical data
with three points: one for latitude, one for longitude, and one for elevation.
GIS programs are able to construct 3-D maps using these figures. See also
Geographical Information System.
distortion: The amount of error found in a map. All maps are approximations,
and all have to accept some compromises. The classic example is simply
trying to show a round globe on a flat screen. See also projection.
docking: Locking a screen element into a particular location. The only dock-
able element in Google Earth is the built-in Web browser, which can be
docked either at the bottom or on the right side of the viewing area.
302
Part VI: Appendixes 

elevation: The height of a point above sea level. Elevation is not visible in
Google Earth unless the Terrain layer is turned on. See also sea level, terrain
level.
equator: The imaginary dividing line between the northern and southern
halves of the Earth. See also latitude, longitude, prime meridian.
full-screen mode: An option in which all unnecessary screen elements are
temporarily hidden in order to make more of the screen available for the
expansion of the viewing area.
geocoding: The matching of a street address with a physical location, typi-
cally expressed in terms of latitude and longitude. Because of the irregular
manner in which addresses are usually assigned and the absolute regularity
of latitude and longitude, the two do not always mesh perfectly. See also lati-
tude, longitude.
Geographical Information System (GIS): Any of the vast array of computer-
ized systems for displaying and working with maps and related data.
GIF: Graphics Interchange Format. The venerable old workhorse of the early
days, the CompuServe GIF format fell from favor as it became entangled in a
seemingly unsolvable legal wrangle about patents and licensing. Although the
patents have now expired and the points are all moot, other formats like PNG
and JPEG have taken the lead. Every graphics program still supports GIFs,
however, because uncountable images already exist in this format. Images are
limited to 256 colors.
Global Positioning System (GPS): A high-tech way of finding the latitude and
longitude of where you are at any given moment and recording the location of
places as you travel. GPS devices use information from orbiting satellites to
pinpoint locations with much greater accuracy than earlier methods.
Information from most GPS devices by either Garmin or Magellan can be
imported into Google Earth.
GPX: TopoGrafix GPS eXchange format. This format for GPS data is pretty
much the standard today.
History drop-down list: A record of earlier operations within a program, gen-
erally displayed in the form of a drop-down list. This history is accessible by
clicking on the arrow on its right side. The history is then shown onscreen.
Clicking any item in the list repeats the action. Your Web browser, for exam-
ple, keeps a history of sites you have visited, and Google Earth keeps track of
searches that you’ve performed.
icon: A small image used to represent a variety of items in a program. In
Google Earth, both the toolbar buttons and elements such as placemarks are
icons. See also placemark, toolbar.
303
Appendix A: Glossary

image: Any graphical representation. In Google Earth, the scene in the view-
ing area can be saved as an image in the form of a JPEG file.
image overlay: An imported graphics file that is placed over the scene in
Google Earth. Typical overlays include current weather information or fore-
casts, traffic data, and so on.
JPG or JPEG: Joint Photographic Experts Group graphics format; used by
Google Earth to save screen images. JPEGs store image data as a bitmap,
using a sophisticated compression scheme. This has the benefit of creating
smaller files but has an inevitable loss of information compared with other
bitmap formats. However, the amount of detail that is lost is minimal and is
usually not visible to the human eye.
key combination: Pressing more than one key at a time. Key combinations are
typically used when issuing a command, to save time compared with using the
mouse to access a menu option. If you want to display the Latitude/Longitude
Grid, for example, it is faster for most people to press the Ctrl and L keys at
the same time than to click View in the menu and then choose Lat/Long Grid
from the resulting submenu. Key combinations are represented by the names
of the keys connected by plus signs, such as Ctrl+L or Ctrl+Alt+B.
Keyhole Markup Language (KML): The native language of Google Earth. KML
is similar to HTML but is geared toward GIS systems instead of Web pages.
Compressed KML files are KMZ files. See also markup language.
KML: Keyhole Markup Language; the native format of Google Earth. This is
used to represent geological information and to process how it is shown
onscreen.
KMZ: A compressed KML file.
label: The textual information that accompanies an icon. For instance, a label
is the name given to a placemark, which appears next to the icon in the view-
ing area.
lat/long grid: A series of lines that show the latitude and longitude of the
scene in the viewing area. When you zoom in more and more, the figures
become more detailed.
latitude: A method of determining the relationship of a particular location
with the equator. Latitude increases as you move away from the equator. See
also equator, longitude.
layer: Any kind of information that is in addition to the basic satellite images
shown in Google Earth. Everything from National Geographic Webcams to the
location of restaurants is a different layer.
304
Part VI: Appendixes 

LOC: EasyGPS storage method for waypoints.
longitude: A method of determining the relationship of a particular location
with the prime meridian. Longitude increases as you move away from the
prime meridian. See also latitude, prime meridian.
loop: The number of times a tour repeats when it is played back. See also tour.
markup language: Any of several computer languages that are meant to
define the appearance of things on a computer screen. The best known of the
markup languages is HTML, the heart of the World Wide Web, but several
other specialized markup languages also exist. See also Keyhole Markup
Language.
model: A representation of something by an image. A wide variety of three-
dimensional models is available for use in Google Earth, ranging from the
Eiffel Tower to whimsical pieces of art.
MOV: Apple QuickTime movie format.
MPS: Garmin MapSource Global Positioning System (GPS) waypoint data.
navigator: The navigation controls located in the upper-right corner of the
viewing area. By default, they’re not visible unless the mouse pointer is over
them, thus making the screen a bit less cluttered.
opacity: See transparency.
overlay: See image overlay.
Overview Map: A small screen insert that shows where the displayed scene
is on the Earth’s surface.
pane: Any of the smaller areas on the computer screen that contain a subset
of controls or other features. In Google Earth, the sidebar contains the Search
pane, the Places pane, and the Layers pane.
pause: The amount of time to wait at a point when playing back a tour. The
default value is 1.7 seconds.
PIX: PCIDSK database file.
placemark: Marks a particular location so that you can easily return to it. A
placemark is to Google Earth what a bookmark is to a Web browser.
PNG: Portable Network Graphics format. This format was developed in
response to legal problems entangling the older GIF format. It shares many of
305
Appendix A: Glossary

the same features with GIF files, but it includes a compression scheme that
works sort of like a JPEG.
polygon: A two-dimensional object composed of connected, closed lines. A
square, for example, is a polygon. When the third dimension of altitude is
applied to a polygon, it becomes 3-D, or an extruded polygon, which is the
basis of all 3-D models in Google SketchUp.
prime meridian: An imaginary north-south line drawn through Greenwich,
England. This is the partner of the equator, dividing the world into two
halves. See also equator, latitude, longitude.
projection: A method of showing a representation of the more-or-less spheri-
cal Earth on a flat surface. Google Earth uses Simple Cylindrical projection,
also known as Platte Carree or Equidistant Cylindrical projection.
public domain: The body of works that are not covered by copyright law and
are therefore nobody’s intellectual property. There is a large variety of public
domain data available for GIS purposes.
radio button: Similar to a check box but round instead. Unlike check boxes,
radio buttons are used for mutually exclusive options. See also check box.
rotation: The pivoting movement of the currently displayed scene around a
central axis. Rotating the view 180 degrees results in north being at the
bottom of the screen.
Ruler: The tool in Google Earth for measuring distances. The ruler is sort of
like a digital measuring tape.
Scale Legend: Like the scale on a printed map that shows the ratio of map
distance to real distance (for example, one inch to the mile). In Google Earth,
the Scale Legend’s ratio varies as you zoom in and out.
scroll wheel: The wheel in the center of most computer mice, used in Google
Earth for navigation control. Many mouse wheels can also be pressed as well
as rolled, thus adding a third button to the mouse.
sea level: The value between high tide and low tide. Sea level is used as a
basis for defining altitude (or depth).
server: See client/server.
SHP: ESRI ArcView’s shapefile format. This format is another popular method
for storing GIS information.
sidebar: The area in Google Earth on the left side that contains the Search,
Places, and Layers panes.
306
Part VI: Appendixes 

SketchUp: A companion program to Google Earth that allows the user to
create three-dimensional models that can then be added to the view in
Google Earth. SketchUp is surprisingly sophisticated for a free program.
SKP: SketchUp 3-D model format (extruded polygons).
slider: A method of setting values for options or for controlling navigation
(tilt, zoom). Sliders are used by dragging the center element within them with
your mouse.
status bar: The place at the bottom of the viewing area that displays informa-
tion, such as the latitude and longitude of your mouse pointer.
TAB: The format for the program MapInfo.
Terrain layer: The display of land elevations instead of just a flat image
onscreen. With the Terrain layer turned on, Google Earth shows the three-
dimensional aspects of the scene.
terrain quality: The amount of detail used when displaying terrain onscreen.
The higher the quality, the more demand on your system. The lower the qual-
ity, the faster Google Earth will work.
text box: A blank rectangle in which to enter textual information. The Search
pane, for example, uses text boxes for entering locations, business types, and
so on. Text boxes are also often used in setting option values.
texture colors: The degree of precision with which textures (the fine details of
terrain) are displayed, depending upon the capabilities of your video card.
TGA: Targa image file format. This was created by Truevision to support its
line of true-color graphics cards.
TIF or TIFF, GeoTiff, and compressed TIFF: Tagged Image File format. This
format is very flexible. It has both compressed and uncompressed versions
as well as the ability to store geographic information in the GeoTiff version.
tilt: The angle at which the view onscreen is presented. By using the Terrain
layer in combination with tilting, views can be obtained that are both more
realistic and more appealing to the average viewer.
toolbar: The set of icons or buttons at the top of the viewing area, providing
quick access to some functions.
ToolTip: A rectangular pop-up that contains information about the object
beneath your mouse pointer.
307
Appendix A: Glossary

topography: The representation of the surface of the Earth in three dimen-
sions, including elevations.
tour: An automated, virtual journey in Google Earth, composed of a series of
placemarks that are displayed one after another.
trackpoint: A series of location data which is automatically logged by a GPS
device as it moves. See also waypoint.
transparency: The degree to which the background behind an image overlay
can show through it.
TXT: Plain text files using the ASCII code, which uses the numbers 0–127 to
represent the most commonly used letters, numbers and symbols in the
English system.
United States Geological Survey (USGS): The U.S. government agency that is
the primary source for digital map information.
vector data: A method of storing image data as a series of points, lines, and
polygons rather than as a standard image file. Software like Google Earth
reconstructs the image from vector data.
waypoint: A GPS device’s version of a placemark, created by the device’s
user. See also trackpoint.
WMV: Microsoft Windows Media Video movie format.
zoom: The act of changing the scale of the map in the viewing area. The
visual effect of zooming is as if you are coming closer to the surface of the
Earth or moving higher above it.
308
Part VI: Appendixes 

Appendix B
Default Content of the 
All Layers Pane
T
he All Layers view setting in the Layers pane shows every one of the
available layers. This Appendix gives you a comprehensive listing of the
whole shebang as of the time of writing. Note: Bear in mind that Google is
always looking for new layers to add, so this list might vary somewhat from
what you find on your computer when you read this. The majority of the con-
tent is self explanatory. Germany Roads, for example, shows roads in
Germany, and Island Names shows the names of (you guessed it) islands. If
you’re not looking for these particular things, you probably won’t want to
turn on those layers.
The three settings for the Layers pane are
 Core: Includes all the layers except for US Government
 All Layers: Shows just that
 Now Enabled: Shows only those layers that have either some or all of
their elements selected
A few of the layers, however, require a bit of explanation:
 The Google Earth Community Showcase: The Showcase hosts some
personal input on various specialized topics. Thus, when you see some-
thing like US Lighthouses - Phred, you know that Phred is hard at work
keeping you up to date on these structures.
 Airports: Similarly, under Airports, you’ll find two listings:
• Airports: This simply shows an image of an airplane at the appro-
priate location.
• Airport Maps: This shows you an outline of the runways themselves
in addition to the location (see Figure B-1).
 DG Coverage: This is the layer for images from Digital Globe, which is a
major supplier of data to Google Earth.

o matter how much you might come to rely upon the search features of
Google Earth, lots of places still haven’t made it into the database of
eventful places, no matter how much they might deserve to be there.
This Appendix is an attempt to fill in the blanks — to give you an advantage
over other Google Earth users when it comes to locating historical places on
the map.
Current Events
Table C-1 shows a variety of locales that keep cropping up in news events
year after year. Figure C-1, for instance, shows the border between the war-
ring states of Israel and Lebanon.

Historical Conflicts
There is not one inch of ground on the surface of the earth that is not soaked
with the blood of its former inhabitants. 
—Anonymous
Setting this simple truth aside, there are certain spots where the more impor-
tant conflicts between nations have taken place, locales like Waterloo or
Saratoga or Pusan (see Figure C-2), where the course of history was changed
and a study of the landscape can help you to understand the event. Table C-2
details scenes of historical conflicts.

Monuments, Statues, and 
Historical Addresses
We like to commemorate our past, which helps preserve some elements from
bygone days. Sometimes this is in the form of a monument, like the Statue of
Liberty shown in Figure C-3. Other times, it’s a traditional old building kept in
use. Table C-3 shows latitude and longitude of monuments, statues, and his-
torical addresses.

Religious Sites
Around the world, the human need for spiritual experience has resulted in var-
ious spots being thought of as holier than the norm. From the city of Jerusalem,
sacred to three world religions, to Bethlehem (as seen in Figure C-5) to the
popular New Age ruins of Stonehenge, here’s a quick overview of sacred
ground. Table C-5 shows the locations of religious sites.

Major Cities
For the first time in history, half the world’s population can be found within
city limits, and many cities now have populations over or at least approach-
ing 10 million, such as Mexico City, as shown in Figure C-6. Here’s a listing of
some of the world’s largest cities. Table C-6 shows the location of major
cities.
