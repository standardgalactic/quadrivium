Introduction
N
ot long after the U.S. stock market crashed in late October 
1929, a reporter for The Saturday Evening Post asked the 
esteemed British economist John Maynard Keynes if he could think 
of another period in history that was as financially bleak.
“Yes,” Keynes replied. “It was called the Dark Ages, and it lasted 
400 years.”
The Great Depression didn’t last quite that long. It is generally 
considered to have begun in late 1929 and ended in 1940 and 1941, 
when the United States stepped up military production as the 
threat of war loomed.
But the influences of the period — from the existence of the Social 
Security system to federal government price supports of U.S. farm 
products to the insurance on bank accounts — are felt in nearly 
every aspect of contemporary life in the United States.
In fact, virtually every economic downturn since the 1930s has 
inspired comparisons to that earlier period and raised questions 
about what happened just before and during the Great Depression. 
In the last 90 days of 2008, for example, the term “Great 
Depression” appeared 270 times in The New York Times alone, 
most often in stories about the state of the 2008 economy.
In most cases, making such comparisons is a legitimate response 
because it’s highly probable that no other period has had as much 
impact on the way government, business, labor, and the American 
people interact with their economy.
The Great Depression has also had personal impacts on many 
modern American families because of the wrenching effects it had 
on their parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents.
For example, I’m a Californian because my mother’s parents moved 
in the 1930s from a dust-choked farm near Stillwater, Oklahoma, to 
the uncertain promise of a better life in Monterey, California. Tens 
of millions of Americans can relate similar stories about how the 
Great Depression affected their families.

About This Book
The Great Depression has long been a favorite topic for historians 
and history book writers. Except for the Civil War, probably no 
period in U.S. history has been written about more than the era 
of Black Thursday, the New Deal, FDR, John Dillinger, bread lines, 
and the Dust Bowl. (Don’t worry if some of these terms aren’t 
familiar — I explain them all in this book.) But Lessons from the 
Great Depression For Dummies takes a little different approach than 
other books about the era.
Here are my goals in this book:
 
✓ To give you a solid grounding in just what happened during 
the Great Depression, in the rest of the world as well as in the 
United States.
 
✓ To look at how the experiences of the 1930s stack up against 
the economic conditions of the 21st century.
 
✓ To assess just what has — and hasn’t — been learned from 
the events of eight decades ago.
 
✓ To maybe spark a chuckle or an “I didn’t know that!” through 
an anecdote or quirky fact about the people and the events of 
the period.
This book is not a textbook. If you’re looking for in-depth dissections 
of Keynesian economics or exhaustive explanations of the 
environmental effects of the Tennessee Valley Authority, you’re 
likely to be disappointed.
It’s also not meant to be a polemic for any particular political 
perspective. However, while I’ve tried hard to be objective, it’s 
possible my personal biases may have snuck in from time to time. 
If they have, I apologize. Just ignore them. I do.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate through the book, I’ve used the following 
conventions:
 
✓ Italics are used both to emphasize a word and to highlight a 
new word or phrase that is being defined.
 
✓ Bold highlights the keywords in a bulleted list.

What You’re Not to Read
Here and there in this book you’re going to see blocks of text in 
shaded gray boxes (called sidebars). They contain quotations, 
mini-profiles of interesting people from the period, anecdotes 
about certain events, or the origins of customs or other aspects of 
American life.
Think of them as side trips off the highway. You can skip right by 
them and stick with the main text, or you can stop for a minute 
before resuming the journey. You could even save them until 
you’ve read all of the main text and then go back to them. It’s like 
two books for the price of one!
Foolish Assumptions
We all know that when you assume, you make an ass of u and me. 
(Well, it was funny in sixth grade.)
Notwithstanding that admonition, I’m making a few assumptions 
about why you picked up this book:
 
✓ You know little to nothing about the Great Depression, and 
you want to find out about it.
 
✓ You know something about the Great Depression, and you 
would like to know more.
 
✓ You know a lot about the Great Depression, and you want to 
see just how big an ignoramus the author is.
Seriously, the only real assumptions I make are that you’re inter-
ested in U.S. history or you’re concerned about what’s happening 
with the current economy and you want to know how it contrasts 
and compares with the 1930s. If either or both assumptions are 
true, I think you have picked up the right book.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is set up so you don’t have to start on the first page and 
go straight through to the last. If you scan the table of contents 
and Chapter 10’s title jumps out and grabs you by the throat, feel 
free to read it first. You can always go back to Chapter 1 later.

Basically, the book is organized along a three-tier structure. The 
parts are collections of chapters grouped more or less around a 
central theme. Next are the chapters themselves, which contain 
aspects of a topic or time period. Finally, the headings and 
subheadings denote parts of the chapters that home in on specific 
subjects.
Oh, and starting with Chapter 3, there’s a section at the end of 
each chapter called “Lessons Learned.” This section looks at how 
events covered in the chapter relate to contemporary situations, 
and whether we do a better job of handling them now than we did 
then.
Here’s a look at what’s in the five parts:
Part I: Heading into a Mess
The chapters in this part are sort of like the appetizer course. 
There’s an overview of the book’s contents (think of it as an 
annotated menu). Then there’s a collection of explanations of 
economic terms and concepts that will make understanding the 
Great Depression easier.
This part is topped off by some pretty detailed background on 
what happened before the Great Depression that helped bring it 
about, from making too many things to having too little money to 
buy them.
Part II: Getting Depressed
This part covers just how hard the Great Depression’s hard times 
were — and who they were hard on, particularly in the three years 
after the stock market crash in late 1929.
It explores the events that helped trigger the Great Depression; 
how it changed Americans’ relationships with each other; how 
people coped with virtually no help from the government; the 
plight of rural Americans (who were doubly hit by the economy 
and Mother Nature); and what was happening in the rest of the 
world.

 Introduction

Part III: Living Through 
the Great Depression
Part III looks at the mass exodus of rural Americans from the 
drought-stricken Great Plains to the West. It also houses 
collections both of characters that made their livings with guns 
and of characters that made their livings with their big mouths. 
I explain how Americans tried to make the best of the gloomy 
economic times by escaping to radio shows or the movies, as well 
as how organized labor got stronger during the era.
Part IV: Fixing Things
This part focuses on the two presidents who played very different 
roles in the Great Depression: Herbert Hoover, the accomplished 
humanitarian who became the Great Goat; and Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, the polio-stricken patrician who simultaneously 
became the best-loved and most-hated man of the era. I examine 
the presidential campaign of 1932 and the transition between 
the two men, as well as Roosevelt’s New Deal cures for the Great 
Depression — how well they worked and their lasting impacts. I 
conclude this part with a summary of what’s different and what’s 
similar about the economies of the 1930s and the 2000s.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Ah, the ubiquitous For Dummies Part of Tens. This particular 
collection includes a look at ten good movies set in the Great 
Depression, ten things invented or popularized in the period, and 
ten things about the 1930s that weren’t so depressing after all.

are built. Me, I almost always go straight to “The Part of Tens” and 
then head back to Chapter 1.
But heck, it’s your book. Enjoy.

Part I
Heading into a Mess

In this part . . . 
T
he Great Depression wasn’t nearly as simple an 
historical period as some people make it out to be. It 
wasn’t just a case of the stock market going down and 
everyone in the United States going broke.
In this part, you get an overview of the period to whet 
your appetite for other parts of the book. And before you 
dine on what comes next, this part gives you a menu of 
economic terms and concepts that can be useful in 
understanding the era.
I top off this part with a summary of the country’s 
economic rough times prior to the Great Depression and a 
fairly detailed look at the decade just before things really 
got rough.

Chapter 1
It Was a Dark and 
Stormy Decade
In This Chapter
▶ Getting into a depression
▶ Dragging nearly everyone down
▶ Coping with life on the economy’s edges
▶ Trying to make things better

n August 1928, a few months before winning the U.S. presidency, 
Republican candidate Herbert Hoover boasted that “we in 
America are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever 
before in the history of any land.”
Boy, was he wrong.
Less than a year after Hoover assumed office, the United States 
was plunged into the deepest and longest economic recession in 
its history. It wasn’t called the Great Depression for nothing.
This book tells the story of this period in U.S. history (from the 
end of 1929 to the country’s entry into World War II in late 1941) 
by looking at the different elements that gave the era its shape, as 
well as some of the lessons and legacies that the era left us. This 
chapter tells you what those elements are and where to find out 
more about them.
Before the Beginning
Every era has a beginning and an end (although historians often 
disagree about just when they occur). But nothing, not even 
history, happens independently of everything else.

Part I: Heading into a Mess  
10
The first part of this book takes a look at events before the Great 
Depression, to put the era in context and explain how those events 
affected things after the depression began. It also provides some 
explanations of terms and concepts that may prove helpful in 
understanding the era.
Defining the Great Depression
While the Great Depression was a political, social, and cultural 
event, as well as a financial calamity, its roots were economic. To 
have some understanding of what happened, you need to have a 
grasp of basic economic terms and processes.
On your to-know list: the difference between a depression and a 
recession; the methods the federal government uses in fighting 
economic downturns; how the Federal Reserve System works; 
what role the stock market plays in a recession; and how inflation 
and deflation factor into recessionary economics. I explain all 
these terms and concepts in Chapter 2.
Tracking events that led 
to the Great Depression
 
The Great Depression wasn’t the first time that the U.S. economy 
hit the skids. In fact, recessions seem to come along with discon-
certing regularity. But they do vary in their causes (foreign wars, 
broken-down railroads, even presidents who don’t like banks), 
their duration, and their lasting impact.
In the period between the end of World War I and the onset of 
the Great Depression, the United States for the most part enjoyed 
economic good times under a string of Republican presidents who 
thought that what was good for big business was good for the 
rest of the country. There were new or improved products to buy 
(especially cars), lots of advertising to help talk people into buying 
them, and easily obtained credit with which to buy them.
But behind the façade of fiscal fun lurked indications that the U.S. 
economy was living on borrowed time. Large groups of Americans — 
farmers, minorities, and low-income workers — were not sharing 
in the good times. The stock market was dangerously overheated, 
and eventually it melted down.
I offer details of the times before the Great Depression, along 
with a look at modern stock market crash safeguards (as well as 
modern credit risks) in Chapter 3.

 Chapter 1: It Was a Dark and Stormy Decade 11
Sharing the Suffering
While relatively few Americans lost money directly when the U.S. 
stock market crashed in October 1929, the pain of the general 
collapse of the economy that followed was felt by almost everyone.
Part II of this book looks at the crushing blows suffered by various 
groups of people, from bankers to farmers.
Going hungry and jobless 
as the banks collapse
Trying to figure out why the Great Depression occurred has 
sparked debate among economists and historians for decades. 
It’s a safe bet there was a combination of reasons for it, from farm 
failures to too many poor people.
 
Whatever its causes, the Great Depression’s consequences were 
devastating. While government officials and business leaders 
initially tried to gloss things over, the U.S. banking system teetered 
on the edge of collapse. It took a change of administrations and an 
extended “bank holiday” to pull the banking industry back from 
the edge.
Unemployment soared, a swelling number of homeless people 
seemed to occupy every street corner, children went hungry, and 
World War I veterans marched on Washington, D.C.
To find out more, read Chapter 4, which also looks at the federal 
program that protects most bank deposits and the three-pronged 
approach the government has taken since World War II to prevent 
recessions from becoming depressions.
Looking for help, and striving 
to help themselves
The Great Depression damaged not only Americans’ wallets and 
purses but also their pride. They had been used to fending for 
themselves, their families, and their friends. But many of them got 
into such deep holes that to get out required help on a much larger 
scale.

Part I: Heading into a Mess  
12
 
The failure to help themselves did not result from lack of trying. 
People did whatever they could to make money, but most often 
they fell short. Local governments and private charities did what 
they could, but it took a change of presidents — and a lot of grit-
ting their teeth — for people to get and take meaningful help from 
the federal government.
In the meantime, people tried to create jobs and make do with what 
they had. The result was often a severe blow to their self-esteem and 
a source of stress in relationships. And hurting the most, as usual, 
were the nation’s minority groups.
Details on all these topics are in Chapter 5, where you’ll also find 
information on the country’s 21st-century social services safety 
net, and how efforts to pay women what they are worth have fared 
since World War II.
Suffering on the farm
Times were tough among U.S. farmers even before the Great 
Depression started. They were in some ways victims of their own 
success: Overproduction of crops led to low prices and small or no 
profits.
Farmers got little help from the federal government until Franklin 
D. Roosevelt was elected president in late 1932. While they were 
waiting, some farmers took things into their own hands by staging 
mini-revolutions.
Then the Roosevelt administration came up with a plan to help 
farmers, in large part by paying them not to farm so much. But 
the federal government couldn’t do much about the drought, dust 
storms, and insect invasions that plagued the agriculture industry 
during the Great Depression.
You can find out lots more in Chapter 6, along with how 
U.S. farmers are faring in the 21st century.
Exporting our economic woes
The United States wasn’t the only country whose economy was 
hurting as the 1930s began. In fact, most of the world was feeling 
financial pain by the end of 1930.

 Chapter 1: It Was a Dark and Stormy Decade 13
Chapter 7 looks at the international state of things after World 
War I, including efforts to make things better and efforts that only 
made things worse.
In that chapter, I explain the role the gold standard played in 
the world economy, offer a country-by-country view of the Great 
Depression, and describe how nations that were under the thrall of 
dictatorships fared. I also introduce two international organizations 
working in the 21st century to foster economic cooperation among 
nations.
Coping with Hard Times
The Great Depression was populated with a lot of disparate 
characters, from the “boxcar children” (kids who hit the road 
looking for a future) to murderous bank robbers to Shakespeare-
spouting labor leaders. Part III of the book covers these characters, 
as well as discussing migrant farm workers, historic labor strikes, 
and more.
Looking for better times 
down the road
While most Americans stayed close to home during the Great 
Depression, a sizeable number packed up what they had and hit 
the road. Chapter 8 describes the three groups in which most of 
those wanderers fell: men looking for work; young people looking for 
somewhere they wouldn’t be a burden and would have a chance 
at a decent life; and families headed for the “promised land” of 
California, only to find the promise was mostly false. The desperation 
of these people is caught in the famous portrait of a migrant 
woman with her children, shown in Figure 1-1.
Chapter 8 also looks at an ambitious federal program that put 
Depression-era young men to work improving the national parks 
and wild lands: the Civilian Conservation Corps. And I discuss the 
plight of migrant farm workers, and how they are (and aren’t) 
protected differently today.

Part I: Heading into a Mess  
14

at a farm workers’ camp in Nipomo, California.
Making noise with speeches, 
rallies, and machine guns
Unlike the citizens of some other countries, Americans never rose 
up in huge numbers to protest the state of things in the Great 
Depression (unless you count the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt 
in 1932 and 1936 as a protest).
That doesn’t mean, however, that there weren’t individuals with 
big visions, big mouths, and substantial followings. Chapter 9 
looks at some of these characters, such as Louisiana Governor and 
Senator Huey Long and Roman Catholic priest/radio commentator 
Charles E. Coughlin.
Chapter 9 also covers efforts by communists and Nazis to gain a 
foothold in the U.S. political scene, as well as the fascination with 
criminals (both on the movie screen and in real life) during the era 
and the correlation between recessions and crime.

 Chapter 1: It Was a Dark and Stormy Decade 15
Putting smiles on depressed faces
One of the sterling qualities of the American character is a refusal 
to stay down just because things aren’t going well. Even in the 
Great Depression, Americans found ways to have fun.
As Chapter 10 reveals, the most popular ways to fill an increasing 
amount of leisure time were to listen to the radio and go to the 
movies. But there were also comic strips, comic books, and pulp 
magazines to peruse; a new kind of music to listen to; legal liquor 
to drink; and better cars to drive.
Developing organized labor
Many sectors of the U.S. economy came out of the Great 
Depression better than they went into it, but perhaps none more 
so than organized labor.
Of course there were downs as well as ups. As Chapter 11 shows, 
it took thousands of strikes, scores of deaths, and three new major 
federal laws for labor to secure a significant role in U.S. politics 
and economic policy.
Chapter 11 also examines the history of the federal minimum wage 
since its inception in the Great Depression, and the role of labor in 
the first decade of the 21st century.
Finding a Way Out of 
the Great Depression
It took years for the United States to get into the Great Depression 
and years to get out of it. Part IV of this book examines the two 
men who bore the most responsibility for turning the country 
around in the era: President Herbert Hoover and President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
This part also looks in detail at the ambitious agenda of Roosevelt 
during his time at the helm, and what the effects of that agenda 
were on later generations. It ends with a look at what can be 
learned from the Great Depression and applied to other economic 
crises in U.S. history, particularly in the 21st century.

Part I: Heading into a Mess  
16
Swapping leaders mid-Depression
Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt had very different back-
grounds, so perhaps it’s not surprising that they took different 
approaches to dealing with the Great Depression. How well they 
succeeded, or how badly they failed, is still a source of debate 
among historians and economists.
Chapter 12 delves into what life experiences each man brought to 
the White House and how the two approached finding cures for the 
country’s economic illnesses. I also look at their 1932 presidential 
race and how they handled the handing-off of power from one to 
the other.
Curing the Great Depression with a 
New Deal’s worth of alphabet soup
Outside of a war, it would be hard to think of another period in U.S. 
history when so much federal government effort went into solving 
a problem as during the Great Depression.
The era was a great period for acronyms. There were federal 
programs from AAA (Agricultural Adjustment Act) to WPA (Works 
Progress Administration). Heck, even the president had one: FDR. 
Roosevelt’s efforts were called the New Deal, even though most 
historians would say that there were really two New Deals.
A lot of historians would also say that the New Deal(s) had a lot more 
lasting impact on the role of the federal government in American 
life than it had an immediate impact on the Great Depression. Read 
Chapter 13 and decide for yourself. And then read a summary of the 
status of Social Security and Medicare in the early 21st century.
Lessons and Legacies from 
the Great Depression
Economically speaking, the worst thing that ever happened to the 
United States was the Great Depression. But it wasn’t the last bad 
thing to happen to the U.S. economy.
In Chapter 14, I offer a summary of what helped to trigger the Great 
Depression and what came about as a result. I also review the 11 
recessions that have come along since World War II and look at the 
differences between the mess that started in 1929 and the one that 
began in late 2007.

f you already know the difference between general equilibrium 
analysis and multilateral trade conventions, go ahead and skip 
this chapter because you clearly have a firm grasp of economic 
theory.
If you’re like me, however, you have a tough time figuring out if 
“three for a dollar” is better than “40 cents each.” If that’s the case, 
stick around and peruse some basic economic terms and concepts 
that will give you a better grasp of what happened in the Great 
Depression and how things have changed since then.
Depression: A Recession 
on Steroids
There’s an old economists’ joke (told mainly by old economists) 
that a recession is when your neighbor loses his job and a 
depression is when you lose yours.
Actually, that’s pretty accurate because the major difference 
between the two is that a depression is more severe than a 
recession, and thus a bigger economic calamity. Think of a 
depression as a recession on steroids.

Part I: Heading into a Mess  
18
Defining a recession
So what’s a recession? Depends on whom you ask. The layman’s 
definition is that a recession occurs when a country’s gross 
domestic product (GDP) — the value of all the reported goods and 
services produced by a country — goes down for two or more 
consecutive quarters (which means for six months or more).
But the “two quarters or more of declining GDP” definition of a 
recession is much too simple for many economists. In fact, the 
official decision as to whether a recession is occurring is left to a 
private, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization called the National 
Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Founded in 1920, the 
NBER uses data from more than 1,000 university professors and 
researchers who look at factors such as manufacturing sales, 
personal income levels, and unemployment rates.
Of course, gathering all that data and analyzing it takes a while, so 
recessions can be months old before the NBER gets around to 
telling us one is occurring (or has already been here and gone).
 
However they’re defined, recessions are pretty common, and most 
economists consider them a natural part of the business cycle. For 
example, the NBER says the United States had recessions in the 
first half of 1980; from July 1981 until November 1982; from July 
1990 until March 1991; from March to November 2001, and from 
December 2007 through at least the first quarter of 2009 (the time 
of this writing).
Sinking into a depression
 
A recession becomes a depression when things get so bad that a 
country’s GDP drops by more than 10 percent. The last time that 
happened in the United States, we called it the Great Depression — 
and not because it was a lot of fun.
To get technical, the Great Depression was really two depressions:
 
✓ From 1929 to 1933, the GDP of the United States plunged 27 
percent, or 10 times as much as during any recession since 
World War II.
 
✓ From 1937 to 1938, after a bit of a rally, the GDP dropped 18 
percent.
Compare those numbers to the 1.5 percent decline in the GDP 
during the 1990–1991 recession or the 0.6 percent it went down 
in the 2001 recession, and you have some idea how severe the 
situation was in the 1930s.

 Chapter 2: Economic Basics: You Say “Depression,” I Say “Broke” 19
To be clear, a depression can still happen in modern times. In the 
1990s, Finland’s economy went into a depression. The Finnish GDP 
dropped 11 percent after the Soviet Union fell apart and Finland 
lost its best market for exporting its goods. (And since we’ve gone 
international for a minute, a global recession is said to occur when 
global economic growth drops to less than 3 percent.)
Considering Economic Cures
Ordinary recession symptoms are, well, depressing. People buy 
less stuff because they feel less confident about making money in 
the future. Factories make less stuff because people are buying less. 
It can be harder to get credit. Unemployment rises, and the stock 
market sags. (But as I explain in Part II, the Great Depression’s symp-
toms made an ordinary recession look like a day at the beach.)
Since one of the purposes of having a federal government is to 
have someone to blame when things go wrong, it seems only fair 
that we look at methods the federal government can use to try to 
pull the economy out of a recession.
Setting fiscal policies
Fiscal policies are basically the guidelines the government follows 
to collect and spend our money. To combat recession, it can take 
the following steps:
 
✓ Cut taxes so people and businesses keep more cash for 
spending on goods and services.
 
✓ Increase spending on government projects to spur 
employment.
 
✓ Widen “safety net” programs such as unemployment insurance.
Quibbling over definitions
“Let it show on the record that when the American people cried out for economic 
help, Jimmy Carter took refuge behind a dictionary. Well, if it’s a definition he wants, 
I’ll give him one. A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is 
when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his.”
— 1980 Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan, responding to criti-
cism from opponent Carter that Reagan had misused the term “depression.”

Adjusting monetary policy: The Fed
The United States pretty much wandered through its first 87 years 
as a country without a functional national banking system. The 
First Bank of the United States (1791–1811) and the Second Bank 
of the United States (1816–1836) were the only sources that issued 
and backed official U.S. currency. All other banks either operated 
under state charters or were strictly private enterprises. Each 
bank issued its own notes, which made for a chaotic system.
In 1863, Congress took the first step toward standardizing banking 
by passing the National Bank Act. The act established rules for 
lending practices and required minimum bank reserves. It also 
slapped a 10 percent tax on state bank notes, which made it 
financially impractical to use anything but federal currency.
In 1913, Congress created the Federal Reserve System, better 
known as the Fed. The system is essentially the federal government’s 
bank. It oversees 12 Federal Reserve banks located around the 
country, issues currency, regulates banking operations, and 
oversees consumer credit rights.
 
The Fed is in charge of monetary policy, which means it helps 
regulate the economy by manipulating the money supply. In a 
recession, the Fed can boost economic growth by lowering the 
amount banks have to keep in reserves, which puts more money in 
circulation. It can directly pump more money into the economy.
The Fed can also lower the federal funds rate (the rate banks 
charge each other for short-term loans), which means that they 
can then charge lower interest rates on loans they make to their 
customers. In the recession that began in late 2007, for example, 
the Fed cut the federal funds rate nine times in 15 months. It 
dropped from 4.75 percent to between .25 percent and zero, the 
lowest in its history.
In 2008, the Fed broke out other tools at its disposal to try to 
open up the country’s credit market. Those tools included buying 
Treasury bonds to prop up investment in the federal government 
and buying up loans that private entities had made so they could 
make new loans without being overburdened with debt.
But keep in mind that at the onset of the Great Depression, the Fed 
was only 16 years old, and like most teenagers, it didn’t always 
make the best decisions. Moreover, most small banks weren’t 
members of the system, mainly because the Fed snubbed them in 
favor of big commercial institutions. Both factors turned out to be 
disastrous, as I explain in Chapter 4.

 Chapter 2: Economic Basics: You Say “Depression,” I Say “Broke” 21
Sizing Up the Stock Market’s 
Role in a Downturn
The maxim that it takes money to make money has a corollary: 
Without money, you can’t make money. One exception to the 
corollary is the stock market. If you’re willing to gamble, you can 
make money by borrowing from someone else. But, of course, you 
can lose money the same way — and lots of it. In this section, I 
explore the role the stock market can play in exacerbating an 
economic downturn.
Buying on margin
Let’s say you want to buy 1,000 shares of Acme Widget Corp., 
which is trading at $10 a share. You need $10,000, but you have 
only $5,000. No problem: You buy on margin.
What that means is you borrow the other $5,000 from your 
stockbroker. Now let’s say Acme goes up in price by a dollar a 
share. Now your 1,000 shares are worth $11,000. You pay back the 
$5,000 you borrowed, and pocket your original $5,000 plus all of 
the $1,000 in increased value (minus any broker fees). You have 
thus profited on twice as many shares as you could have bought 
on your own.
 
Of course the reverse is true as well. If the price goes down, the 
broker may ask you to put some more money into your account as 
collateral for the amount you borrowed. That’s called a margin call, 
and it sort of takes the fun out of buying on margin.
In the 1920s, it was common for investors to leverage as much as 
90 percent of a stock purchase. Broker loans rose from $2.5 billion 
in 1926 to $8.5 billion in October 1929. Brokers charged interest 
rates of as much as 20 percent. No one cared because stock prices 
were going up so fast that everyone was making money.
But what was making the market go up so fast was the huge 
amount of money people were in effect borrowing by buying on 
margin. They used that money to bid up the price of stocks far out 
of proportion to the real value of the company issuing the stock. 
The Radio Corporation of America (RCA), for example, went from 
$85 to $420 in 1928 despite the fact that it had never paid a dividend.
When the overheated market dropped and margin calls were 
placed in droves, few people could repay what they had borrowed. 
“Buying on margin” became a recipe for disaster (see Chapter 3).

Nowadays, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the 
Federal Reserve Board, the stock exchanges, and the brokerage 
firms themselves set rules on which stocks you can buy on margin, 
what the minimum percentage is that investors must put up, and 
when brokerages must make margin calls. In 2008, investors had 
to put up a minimum of 50 percent of their own money to buy on 
margin. That regulation discourages wild speculation and also helps 
keep such speculation from artificially driving up stock prices.
Making pooled investments
If buying on margin seems a little risky, but you still want to invest 
in a variety of stocks with just a little money, the solution may be 
to pool your investment with a bunch of other small investors, give 
it to a stock-picking professional, and sit back and wait for the 
profits to roll in. That’s basically what a mutual fund is. Mutual 
funds have been around in their current, regulated form since 
1940. In 2008, there were more than 8,000 of them in the United 
States, with a total investment value of more than $12 trillion.
Samuel Insull
He began as a protégé to Thomas Edison and ended up face down in a Paris 
subway. In between, Samuel Insull was a hero of U.S. capitalism — and a villain of 
the Great Depression.
Insull was born in London in 1859. At 21, he came to New York and became Edison’s 
private secretary and right-hand man. After helping to launch what would become 
the General Electric Co., Insull moved to Chicago and began building an electric 
utility super company. By the end of the 1920s, Insull’s electric empire stretched to 
parts of 32 states and had 4 million customers.
To build his company, Insull sold low-priced stocks and bonds in various hold-
ing companies he controlled. More than a million people invested. But when the 
stock market crashed in October 1929, the empire went belly up, and investors lost 
more than $700 million. Subsequent investigations found an elaborate shell game 
in which one Insull company would sell property to another Insull firm at a large 
“profit.” Then the property would be sold again to a third Insull firm. The profits, 
however, existed only on paper.
Insull, who had been on the cover of Time magazine in 1929 as a captain of industry 
and patron of the arts (he gave $20 million to build the Chicago Civic Opera House), 
found himself on the cover of Time in 1934 as the defendant in a fraud and anti-
trust case. Although he was eventually acquitted, he was financially and personally 
ruined, and he left the country. He died in a Paris subway station in 1938 after suf-
fering a heart attack. As a final indignity for a 1920s tycoon, his wallet was stolen 
from his body.

 Chapter 2: Economic Basics: You Say “Depression,” I Say “Broke” 23
The 1920s versions were called investment trusts, but they were 
actually more like pyramid schemes than mutual funds. An average 
investor would buy shares (often on margin) in, say, Big Ed’s 
Investment Trust. Big Ed and other trusts would buy shares of an 
even bigger trust, which would buy shares in an actual company.
The insidious part of the trusts — beside the incredible risk 
factor — was that they tied up much of the nation’s investment 
capital. Instead of money going into businesses so that they could 
expand, make new products, and hire more people, much of that 
money just floated between trusts for speculation schemes.
Not everyone thought the investment trusts were a wonderful 
system. President Herbert Hoover called the trust system “an orgy 
of mad speculation” and noted that “there are crimes far worse 
than murder for which men should be reviled and punished.” But 
most people shrugged off any criticism.
Factoring in Inflation 
and Deflation
 
Inflation is basically a sustained rise in the prices of goods and 
services. In the United States, the inflation rate is most generally 
measured by something called the Consumer Price Index (CPI). 
The CPI gauges what a collection of goods and services costs at 
the moment, compared to what it cost at a fixed point in the past, 
which is set at 100. For example, a CPI of 120 would mean the 
goods and services that used to cost $100 now cost $120 — a 20 
percent inflation rate.
Most economists agree that a low inflation is best. In the United 
States, inflation rates stayed between 1.6 percent and 3.3 percent 
from 1991 through 2008.
The gold standard: Keeping 
inflation in check
Since the cost of goods rose more than 1,000 percent in the last 
60 years of the 20th century, it’s hard to believe that for most 
of history, inflation hardly existed. In the last third of the 19th 
century, for example, prices on many things in the United States 
dropped by nearly 50 percent as advances in transportation and 
technology made making and moving products cheaper.

Part I: Heading into a Mess  
24
Another reason inflation didn’t pose much of a problem until the 
1920s was that most countries (at least most Western countries) 
were on the gold standard. That term refers to a country tying its 
currency directly to the amount of gold it holds. The idea is that 
someone could go to the country’s treasury and exchange paper 
money for an equivalent amount in gold. It also means that countries 
did business with each other by transferring gold rather than 
currency. Because the supply of money was limited to the amount 
of gold a country had on hand, prices and wages tended not to 
increase dramatically.
The gold standard more or less worked until after World War I, 
when some countries were so broke that they needed to print 
more money than they had gold to support. That led to severe 
inflation, as governments began churning out currency to help 
people with rising prices on scarce commodities. In post-war 
Germany, inflation got so bad that people literally had to carry 
their cash in wheelbarrows so they could buy a loaf of bread. 
(See Chapter 7 for a discussion of when and why the United States 
broke away from the gold standard.)
Battling deflation
 
The opposite of inflation — known as deflation — can be even 
more damaging to an economy. Deflation occurs when prices 
persistently fall. This decline usually reflects a drop in demand 
for goods and services. That situation causes oversupplies, which 
leads to slowed production, which leads to rising unemployment, 
which leads to even less demand.
Credit shrinks as a result of heightened fears that loans won’t be 
repaid. Consumers stop buying because they’re afraid they’ll need 
the money even more in the future, or because they think prices 
will be even lower tomorrow. And the downward spiral continues.
Because prices drop in a deflationary period, people who bought 
things on credit — such as houses — find themselves in a bad way. 
After the October 1929 stock market crash, for example, housing 
prices dropped steeply. People found they owed more on their 
homes than they were worth. As unemployment rose, families who 
could no longer meet their mortgage payments found themselves 
homeless, as well as jobless.

T
he Great Depression didn’t just get great overnight. It took 
years of events — some related to each other, some not — to 
give it form, and even then its enormity wasn’t recognized right 
away.
In this chapter, I look at the up-and-down cycles of the U.S. economy 
prior to the Great Depression; the prosperity of the Roaring 
Twenties (both real and imagined); the hidden chasm between the 
rich and the poor that grew during that period; and the “everyone 
should be rich” ethos that helped trigger the stock market crash at 
the end of the decade.
Riding the Economic Cycle
Since the birth of the United States, its economy has tended to run in 
cycles, with periods of somewhere between 10 and 20 years of 
moderate-to-good times, interspersed with a few years of hard times.
Prior to the rise of capitalism, recessions were usually triggered 
by a specific external event, such as war, crop failures, or natural 
disasters. In capitalist economies, however, the causes of hard 
times are often attributed to the forces of the marketplace: supply 
and demand, consumer spending and saving, and the vagaries of 
people’s responses to economic events.

Part I: Heading into a Mess  
26
Whatever the cause (and there is ceaseless debate among 
economists about precisely what causes recessions), the advent 
of hard times is often preceded by calamities in the banking 
industry and stock market. Hard times also often come hard on 
the heels of over-speculation in land or securities. Creditors call in 
loans, money supplies get tight, and businesses close.
 
“It has been a history of extravagant expansions in the business 
of the country, followed by ruinous contractions,” said President 
James Buchanan in 1857. “At successive intervals the best and 
most enterprising men have been tempted to their ruin by excessive 
bank loans of mere paper credit, exciting them to extravagant 
importations of foreign goods, wild speculations, and ruinous and 
demoralizing stock gambling.”
But we always seem to get over it.
Some hard times before World War I
The precise beginnings and endings of recessions are as elusive 
as their exact causes. Keeping that in mind, though, following is a 
look at a half dozen tough economic times that the United States 
went through prior to World War I.
You can’t tax the Feds (1819–1824)
The end of the War of 1812 (in 1815) left the United States feeling 
financially frisky. U.S. goods were selling well in Europe. Banks 
were liberal in their lending, especially to finance the sale of public 
lands in the West. Public land sales rose from $4 million in 1816 to 
$13.6 million in 1818.
Things were going so well, in fact, that stock traders on New York’s 
Wall Street were compelled to take their business literally off the 
street in March 1817, moving it indoors and forming the New York 
Stock Exchange.
But a number of factors conspired to create this country’s first 
great economic crisis. Perpetual wars between France and England 
finally ended in 1815, spurring economic growth in those countries 
that competed with U.S. production. U.S. banks issued their own 
currency with little ability to back it in specie or hard money, mean-
ing gold and silver coins. When they needed more money, they 
simply printed more, which resulted in rapid inflation.
In 1816, Congress established the Second Bank of the United States 
(the first went out of business in 1811) in an effort to rein in the 
independent banks and establish some uniformity to currency. In 
1819, the Bank began calling in loans it had made to state banks, 

 Chapter 3: Prelude to Disaster: The Economy Prior to 1929 27
and it demanded hard money as payment. (Part of the reason was 
that the United States needed to pay back — in gold — foreign 
loans it had received to finance the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.) 
The state banks, in turn, began calling in loans they had made, 
and many debtors couldn’t meet their obligations. Wages fell, 
businesses failed, and banks closed.
Several states tried to counter the Bank’s calling in of loans by 
imposing taxes on the Bank’s assets within their borders. But in 
1820, the U.S Supreme Court ruled that while the federal government 
had the constitutional authority to tax state and private banks, the 
states did not have the right to tax a federal institution. It wasn’t 
until the mid-1820s that things leveled off.
The president who didn’t like banks (1837–1843)
Through the last half of the 1820s and first half of the 1830s, the 
U.S. economy chugged along. By 1834, the national debt had been 
paid off. Roads, railways, and canals were being built at a rapid 
pace. Public lands in the West were being snapped up, in large part 
by speculators. Land sales soared from around $2.3 million in 1830 
to $24.9 million by 1836.
To finance all that activity, banks were issuing loans like crazy. 
Not only that, but they were also still printing their own currency 
to lend. Inflation resulted, but few people minded because there 
seemed to be plenty of cash to cover things.
One guy who did mind was the president of the United States. 
Andrew Jackson had an antipathy to banks in general, in part 
because he had once lost a lot of money in one. He particularly 
disliked the Second Bank of the United States, believing it was 
unconstitutional. As a westerner, he also disliked what he viewed 
as the Bank’s favoritism toward the desires of northeastern 
financiers and speculators.
 
So in 1832, Jackson vetoed a bill that would have extended the 
charter of the Bank past its 1836 expiration date. He also withdrew 
the federal government’s money from the Bank and deposited it 
in “pet banks” chartered by various states. In July 1836, Jackson 
delivered another financial body blow by issuing the “Specie 
Circular,” or Coinage Act. It decreed that the federal government 
would accept payment for public lands in gold or silver coin only. 
Jackson’s idea was to end rampant speculation and inflationary 
practices spurred by banks that printed notes.
By the time Jackson left office in March 1837, the economic bubble 
had begun to burst. Foreign investors decided they wouldn’t 
accept U.S. paper either, and they called in their substantial loans. 
U.S. banks, in turn, called in their loans to people who had nothing 

Part I: Heading into a Mess  
28
to repay them with but paper. By April, businesses were failing. 
Unemployment reached 10 percent, and about 800 banks closed. 
With little hard money in circulation, deflation took over for 
inflation, and wages and prices dropped.
Jackson’s successor, Martin Van Buren, took the heat for Jackson’s 
actions. Van Buren lost his 1840 reelection bid, and the economy 
stayed in the tank until 1843.
Bad news travels fast (1857–1859)
While it didn’t last as long as the recessions of 1819 and 1837, 
the 1857 downturn was remarkable in several other aspects. The 
immediate sparks were the failure of the New York branch of a 
major financial company called the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust 
Company, due to embezzlement; and the sinking of the SS Central 
America, which was carrying 30,000 pounds of gold from the San 
Francisco mint to eastern banks.
Both events took place within three weeks of each other in late 
summer, and news of both was quickly spread around the country 
by the telegraph, still a relatively new medium. The immediacy of 
the news heightened the events’ impacts.
But there were more fundamental causes for the recession. The 
end of the Crimean War between Britain and Russia drove down 
demand for U.S. grain. The panicked stock selling that followed 
news of the trust company collapse and gold ship sinking induced 
British investors to withdraw funds from U.S. banks.
 
The recession was notable for one other reason. The downturn 
had less of an impact on the South, where the cotton industry was 
solid. That encouraged many southerners to believe they could 
make an economic go of it without the North, should the country 
split up.
The Railroad Depression (1873–1879)
Following the end of the Civil War in 1865, the U.S. economy found 
itself driven by a boom in railroad construction. Between 1866 
and 1873, 35,000 miles of track were laid. Railroads trailed only 
agriculture in importance to the country’s financial well-being.
In 1873, however, Congress passed a bill that called for backing U.S. 
currency with gold only. Silver coins were out, and the Treasury 
quit buying silver at a fixed price. The move depressed silver 
prices, reduced the money supply, and created uncertainty in the 
economy.

 Chapter 3: Prelude to Disaster: The Economy Prior to 1929 29
On September 18, 1873, uncertainty turned to panic when a major 
bank, Jay Cooke & Co., declared bankruptcy. The firm, which 
became prominent marketing Union bonds during the Civil War, 
was pushing a plan to build a second transcontinental railroad. 
Unable to attract enough backing, Cooke collapsed.
The failure started a deluge of panicky unloading of stocks. A 
stunned New York Stock Exchange closed for ten days. About 25 
percent of U.S. railroads went belly up, thousands of auxiliary 
businesses failed, and unemployment rose to 14 percent by 1876.
The job losses, combined with wage reductions, spurred labor 
unrest around the country. Acrimony between labor and 
management lasted well beyond the end of the depression, 
which lasted until 1879.
When the gold ran out (1893–1897)
The depression that began in 1893 in many ways paralleled the 
downturn of 1873. In February 1893, the largest railroad company, 
the Philadelphia and Reading, went bankrupt. More railroads and 
other businesses went under. Unemployment percentages climbed 
into the teens. Hard times in Europe dried up investment from 
other countries.
But there was a wrinkle to the 1893 depression that hadn’t happened 
before, and it had to do with the U.S. money supply. In 1890, 
Congress had decided to require the U.S. Treasury to buy silver 
with notes that could be redeemed in gold.
Coupled with a demand by European investors to be paid only in 
gold, the policy resulted in shrinking U.S. gold reserves. In April 
1893, officials announced that the nation’s gold supply had dipped 
below the $100 million minimum that federal law required be kept 
on hand. Panic set in. Nervous investors, fearful they would be 
paid in silver rather than gold, began runs on banks. The stock 
market crashed as banks collapsed. Violent labor strikes paralyzed 
railways, as they had in the 1870s.
Ultimately, the Treasury sold bonds to obtain enough gold to build 
up its reserves, and the law requiring the federal purchase of silver 
with gold-backed certificates was repealed. But the country didn’t 
fully recover until 1897.
The bankers’ panic (1907–1908)
As recessions go, the Panic of 1907 was relatively short-lived. But 
its eventual impact was significant. It started when two Montana 
mine owners and a New York City banker tried to corner the 
national copper market in October 1907.

Part I: Heading into a Mess  
30
The effort by F.A. Heinze, his brother Otto, and Charles W. Morse 
involved taking control of banks and trusts, and using their assets 
to take over the copper market. Doing so would allow them to set 
any price they pleased for the metal. But the scheme failed. As a 
result, the companies involved suffered huge losses. People began 
pulling money out of banks and the stock market, which lost half 
its value.
Enter an unlikely hero: 70-year-old financier J.P. Morgan. The 
richest banker in the country pledged huge personal sums to shore 
up shaky banks. He dragooned other financiers to do the same and 
was joined by the U.S. Treasury. The rescue plan worked. But the 
episode rekindled debate about the lack of a U.S. central bank to 
oversee the money supply and coordinate bailouts in dire times.
 
In 1908, Congress established a National Monetary Commission, 
charging it with finding a way to regulate U.S. banking. It took until 
1911 for the commission to craft a plan, and another two years for 
Congress to approve it. On December 22, 1913, President Woodrow 
Wilson signed the bill creating the Federal Reserve System. Before 
it passed the measure, however, the Senate removed a provision 
that would have offered some insurance for bank depositors. That 
change would cost a lot of people a lot of money in coming years.
Not much fun after World War I
The First World War (1914–1918) had a major impact on the U.S. 
economy — and a big role in the creation of the Great Depression.
The United States stayed out of the first three years of the war, 
which pitted the Allies (chiefly Britain, France, and Russia) against 
the Central Powers (chiefly Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the 
Ottoman Empire). U.S. manufacturers and farmers took advantage of 
Europe’s simultaneous preoccupation with the war and demands 
for food and goods by in essence becoming the war’s supermarket. 
Between 1914 and 1918, U.S. steel production doubled, and farm 
exports tripled.
 
When the United States finally entered the war in April 1917 on the 
side of the Allies (in part because they were better customers), 
the U.S. economy was bolstered by a wave of government spending, 
which rose from $1.3 billion in 1916 to a hefty $15.6 billion in 1918. 
The government raised revenues by increasing taxes and selling 
bonds. The Feds also basically took over the running of the economy. 
Federal boards and commissions oversaw food production and 
pricing, fuel allocation, railroad operations, and labor relations.

 Chapter 3: Prelude to Disaster: The Economy Prior to 1929 31
Organized labor didn’t mind the federal oversight because it gave 
some protection to those trying to organize labor unions. Union 
membership increased by 40 percent between 1915 and 1918. The 
labor shortage caused by the military draft brought significant 
numbers of women into the workforce, and some 500,000 African 
Americans migrated from the South to take jobs in the North and 
Midwest. Wages went up, and life wasn’t bad on the home front.
Then the war ended in November 1918. More than $3 billion in 
federal war-related contracts were canceled almost overnight. 
Several million soldiers and sailors became civilians again, looking 
for jobs. Racial tensions rose as black workers were shoved out of 
jobs to make room for returning white workers. Scores of strikes 
sparked charges that unions were in league with communists.
The switch from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy 
triggered a sharp recession in 1920. An oversupply of food and 
other products caused severe deflation (a big drop in prices, followed 
by stalled production, rising unemployment, and even less 
demand). The unemployment rate reached 11 percent by 1921.
 
Prodded by his Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, President 
Warren G. Harding convened a meeting of 300 business and 
banking leaders in September 1921 to discuss the unemployment 
problem. The Unemployment Conference eventually organized 
state and local relief efforts such as public works projects and 
“work sharing” programs. This was the first time a major federal 
effort was made to try to assuage the pains caused by a recession.
Things did get better, as they tend to do. Manufacturers retooled 
from wartime products to consumer goods. Women went home, 
opening jobs for returning veterans. By 1923, the economy was 
humming again, at least for most people.
But the war left lasting marks on the U.S. economy. Technological 
advances necessitated by wartime demands increased productivity. 
That spurred the development of new products or improvements 
on old ones, which in turn spurred consumer demand.
The role of the United States in the world economy also changed. 
Prior to World War I, it had been a debtor nation, meaning its 
overseas investments were smaller than the investments other 
countries had in the United States. That changed after the war, as 
huge public and private U.S. loans to war-torn European countries 
made us a creditor nation. New York replaced London as the 
Western world’s financial center. And that was fine, as long as the 
U.S. economy remained healthy.

Sharing the Good Times 
with “Silent Cal”
Warren G. Harding campaigned for the U.S. presidency in 1920 using 
a slogan he coined himself: “A return to normalcy.” He had meant 
to say “normality,” which should give you some idea of what a 
nincompoop Harding was. Still, the slogan struck a chord with 
voters. After the war and the post-war struggles, Americans were 
ready to kick up their heels a bit and enjoy life. Harding was elected 
in a landslide, and the Roaring Twenties started getting noisy.
Harding himself missed most of it, having had the good sense to die 
in August 1923 and thus escape an administration notable mainly 
for political scandal. But his successor, Calvin Coolidge, shared 
Harding’s political philosophy that the chief role of the government 
when it came to the economy was to foster business growth.
Known as “Silent Cal” for his aversion to speechmaking, Coolidge 
did manage to observe aloud that “the chief business of the 
American people is business,” and “the man who builds a factory 
builds a temple, and the man who works there, worships there.”
All three Republican administrations during the 1920s (Harding’s, 
Coolidge’s, and Herbert Hoover’s) did what they could to foster 
business growth. Tariffs were raised to protect U.S. manufacturers. 
Tax rates for the wealthy were lowered, purportedly to encourage 
them to invest more. The Federal Reserve Board kept interest rates 
low, so money was easier to borrow.
The presidents’ perspectives reflected a highly popular sentiment 
of the times, which was reflected by the title of a 1929 article in 
Ladies’ Home Journal: “Everybody Ought To Be Rich.” In an era 
known at the time as “the Coolidge Prosperity,” the acquisition 
of wealth to finance the acquisition of consumer goods, from 
electric irons to mouthwash, became tantamount to being a good 
American.
 
“As consumers of wealth, we exhibit mental and moral solidarity,” 
asserted Franklin Giddings, a Columbia University sociologist, in 
1922. “We want the same things. We have the same tastes.”
The United States did seem richer. The gross domestic product 
grew from $51 billion in 1920 to $97 billion in 1929. Disposable 
income (the amount left after taxes are paid) increased from $33.3 
billion in 1918 to $77.5 billion in 1928. And there was no consumer 
item more attractive to disposable income in the 1920s than the 
automobile.

 Chapter 3: Prelude to Disaster: The Economy Prior to 1929 33
Driving to the good life
In October 1923, National Geographic ran an article reporting 
that there were 13 million “motorcars” on U.S. roads. The author 
gushed, “The demand for initiative and enterprise in those who 
own and operate an automobile are giving to the American people 
a training the value of which cannot be estimated in dollars and 
cents.”
Notwithstanding the author’s sentiment, the dollars-and-cents 
impact the automobile had on 1920s’ America was pretty hefty:
 
✓ By the end of the decade, one in every eight U.S. jobs was 
related to the automobile, from the people who made tires to 
the people who ran roadside motor hotels, or “motels.”
 
✓ By 1925, there were 17.5 million motor vehicles registered in 
the country, and by 1929, there were 27 million — or one for 
every five Americans. Estimates showed there were more cars 
in New York than in all of Europe.
 
✓ Production methods had improved so much that a car that 
took 14 hours to build in 1913 was coming off the assembly 
line at a rate of every 10 seconds by 1925. The production 
speedup was reflected in lower prices. A car that cost the 
equivalent of two years’ average wages before World War I 
cost about three months’ worth in 1929.
But the National Geographic writer was correct in that the value 
of a car transcended its price for most Americans. They were no 
longer captives of the streetcar or bus schedule. They could live 
farther away from work, shop in distant stores, and take motor 
vacations.
 
Early cars had been simple transportation machines, with no frills. 
Automaker Henry Ford reportedly said that Ford buyers could 
have a car in any color they wanted “as long as they wanted black” 
(which dried faster than other colors and thus speeded up produc-
tion). But as they became more acquisitive, Americans wanted 
more from their autos. Cars became an extension of a family’s 
lifestyle, a status symbol. “[H]is motor car was poetry and tragedy, 
love and heroism,” Sinclair Lewis wrote in his 1922 novel Babbitt.
Ford stubbornly stuck to no-frills cars (although he did close down 
for six months in 1927 to retool his factory for production of a new 
model — the Model A). However, Ford’s rivals, particularly William 
C. Durant at General Motors, began offering extra features for extra 
money. The company began offering upscale models that made 
them stand out from the neighbors’ cars.

34
 
And if someone couldn’t afford to pay cash for a car, no problem. 
In 1919, GM started the General Motors Acceptance Corporation 
(GMAC) to let buyers purchase on the installment plan. By 1926, 75 
percent of all auto buyers were buying on credit.

In 1919, the same year that General Motors Acceptance Corporation 
began offering credit to car buyers, GM bought a small refrigerator 
company called Frigidaire. Realizing that a refrigerator, like 
a car, was basically a big box with a motor, GM began adapting 
its methods of making and selling cars to making and selling 
refrigerators. That included letting customers buy on credit.
Americans had traditionally viewed buying anything other than 
real estate on credit as something between embarrassing and 
shameful. But in the 1920s, Ben Franklin’s “a penny saved is a 
penny earned” maxim seemed old hat. A 1928 business yearbook 
noted that installment buying “is now recognized as an integral 
part of our economic life.”
 
By the end of the decade, more than 60 percent of appliances and 
furniture was being bought on installment plans. Consumer debt 
rose from $2.6 billion in 1920 to $7.1 billion in 1929. Installment 
buying at such high levels kept product demand — and thus 
production — at higher rates than the amount of real money in the 
economy could sustain indefinitely. The result was a situation that 
could — and did — lead to severe deflation.
In late 1928, the National Association of Credit Men, a group of 
30,000 merchants and manufacturers, warned that “making it easy 
for people to buy beyond their needs or to buy before they have 
saved enough to gratify their wishes tends to encourage a condition 
that . . . supports a form of transaction for which credit buying is 
not primarily intended.” But not many people were listening.
Creating demand for needless things
One of the challenges in a consumer-driven economy is to convince 
people that they need to keep consuming. That’s where advertising 
comes in, and in the 1920s, it became both an art and a science.

 Chapter 3: Prelude to Disaster: The Economy Prior to 1929 35
 
Traditional advertising had merely suggested the availability of a 
product. But in the 1920s, ads earnestly explained the necessity 
of a product, even when the necessity was wholly fabricated. 
Normal health and hygiene conditions were elevated to serious-
sounding maladies: bad breath became “halitosis,” sour stomach 
was “acidosis,” and stinky feet “bromodosis,” all of which were 
curable by some product or other.
 
The economist Stuart Chase observed in 1925 that advertising 
“creates a dream world: smiling faces, shining teeth, school girl 
complexions, cornless feet, perfect fitting union suits, distinguished 
collars, wrinkleless pants, odorless breath, regularized bowels 
(and) happy homes in New Jersey — 15 minutes from Hoboken.”
The ad game became a sophisticated avocation. Its most successful 
practitioners included Bruce Barton, who invented the baking icon 
Betty Crocker and wrote a best-selling book called The Man Nobody 
Knows. The book, which sold a staggering 700,000 copies between 
1925 and 1927, portrayed Jesus Christ as a “super salesman” and 
“the father of modern business.” There was also Edward Bernays, 
who had honed his pitchman’s skills by spending summers in his 
youth with his uncle, Sigmund Freud. Bernays is credited — or 
blamed — for breaking down the taboo against women smoking in 
public by promoting cigarettes as “torches of independence” for 
the modern female.
Advertisers used sex, celebrities, and pseudo-science to sell, and 
they utilized newspapers, mass-circulation magazines, and the 
ubiquitous and new-in-the-1920s medium of radio to make their 
pitches national. In 1919, total advertising in the United States 
cost an estimated $684 million. By 1929, it was a $3 billion-a-year 
business — and inspiring a whole lot of consumption, much of it 
on credit.
Getting Richer, or Staying Poor
While it may have appeared on the surface that 1920s America was 
installment-buying itself a life of ease and comfort, the reality was 
far different.
Most working people still put in six-day weeks. Paid vacations and 
pensions were rare. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down minimum 
wage laws for women and children during the decade. Job security 
was rare. A man held his job until he was too old or infirm to be as 
productive as a younger man, and then he was out the door.

Some employers adopted paternalistic practices (known as 
welfare capitalism) to keep unions at bay. Henry Ford, for example, 
periodically raised wages and shortened workweeks. There were 
sometimes fringe benefits, such as company picnics. But when 
company profits slipped, the fringe benefits quickly disappeared.
A much worse problem was the mountainous disparity in the 
distribution of wealth, as evidenced by some statistics:
 
✓ The wealthiest 1 percent of Americans saw their incomes 
increase 75 percent in the 1920s, while the average worker’s 
income rose just 9 percent. The 24,000 richest U.S. households 
controlled as much combined wealth as the 11.5 million at the 
bottom.
 
✓ While 0.1 percent of U.S. households had 34 percent of the 
country’s savings, 80 percent had no savings at all.
 
✓ About 40 percent of American families in 1929 earned less 
than the $1,500 annual income that the federal government 
deemed the poverty level. That compares to 8.4 percent living 
at the federal poverty level of $15,000 in 2006. In 1929, only 2.3 
percent earned more than $10,000 a year. In 2006, 24.2 percent 
earned more than $100,000, a comparable inflation-adjusted 
figure.
As ominous for the economy was the growing gap between 
productivity and wages. From 1923 to 1929, productivity per hour 
(the amount of goods made) rose 32 percent. During the same 
period, wages rose just 8 percent.
What that meant was there were too many things being produced 
and not enough people with the money to buy them. A person 
earning $100,000 a year was making 50 times more than the person 
earning $2,000 a year. But the wealthier person wasn’t likely to buy 
50 times as many cars or radios or refrigerators, or to spend 50 
times as much for them.
So the rich put much of their excess money into luxury items (the 
making of which didn’t employ a lot of people) or into investments. 
That led to more productivity but not more money in the pockets 
of average Americans.
Feeling downtrodden on the farm
If the average urban worker wasn’t exactly rolling in clover during 
the 1920s, he had it made compared to his cousin on the farm. In 
fact, the best days for U.S. farmers had come and gone by the time 
the 1920s started.

 Chapter 3: Prelude to Disaster: The Economy Prior to 1929 37
During World War I, the U.S. government encouraged farmers 
to produce as much as they could to help feed the country’s 
European allies. So farmers mortgaged more land, doubling their 
total mortgage debt between 1910 and 1920. As mechanized 
vehicles such as trucks and tractors replaced horses and mules, 
25 million acres once used to grow animal feed were put into crop 
production for humans.
 
But when the war ended, the European markets dried up, and 
prices dropped. Cotton that had sold for 35 cents a pound during 
the war slumped to 16 cents in 1920. Corn that had sold for $1.50 
a bushel slipped to 52 cents. Farm income during the decade 
dropped 50 percent. Bankruptcies in the Midwest alone quadrupled, 
and more than 3 million people left farms for towns and cities.
In the South, half of the farmers lived on rented land. Those who 
lacked their own capital had to pledge shares of their crops as 
payment for rent and supplies. Most of these sharecroppers were 
African Americans, and almost all of them were desperately poor.
Congress made some effort to help, twice passing bills that would 
have established “parity” programs in which the federal govern-
ment would buy surplus crops at guaranteed prices, and then sell 
them overseas for whatever the market would pay. But Coolidge 
vetoed both bills. “Farmers have never made money,” he said. “I 
don’t believe we can do much about it.”
Sweet deals in the Sunshine State
The stock market wasn’t the only place people were looking to get rich in the 1920s. 
For example, there was the Florida land boom of 1925–1926.
An estimated $450 million poured into the state, lured by promoters who promised 
lush waterfront paradises or lively resort cities. Many of those who bought didn’t 
care if they were actually buying fetid swampland, as long as they could resell at 
a higher price to someone else. And enough were able to do just that, keeping the 
scheme going for months.
Eventually the speculative bubble burst, just as two hurricanes slammed into the 
state, killing some 400 people and leaving 25,000 people homeless. By 1928, more 
than a hundred Florida and Georgia banks that grew fat on speculation money went 
under, taking much of the money with them.
The ridiculousness of the situation wasn’t lost on the Marx Brothers, who 
lampooned it in their 1929 film The Coconuts: “Why, you can get stucco,” leers 
pitchman Groucho in one scene. “Oh, how you can get stucco.”

38
When Hoover became president in 1929, he pushed through 
Congress a bill that called for government price subsidies for farm 
products. Within months, however, the rural depression of the 
1920s collided with the Great Depression of the 1930s, and life for 
U.S. farmers only got worse.
Immigrants and African Americans: 
Getting by at the bottom of the heap
Following World War I, America’s distaste for foreign entanglements 
led to a series of laws limiting immigration. Even so, the 1930 
Census showed that 10 percent of the population was foreign-born. 
Handicapped by language and cultural barriers, immigrants got the 
worst jobs and lived in the worst parts of towns and cities. As the 
Great Depression took hold in the early 1930s, many of them would 
turn around and go back where they originated.
Tightening immigration quotas meant U.S. industry had to find a 
new source of workers. A half million African Americans left the 
South for factory jobs during the war. Another 1 million would do 
the same during the 1920s. But they remained second-class citizens. 
Infant mortality rates for African Americans were twice those of 
white Americans. Life expectancies were 15 years shorter.
In the Southwest, a half million Mexicans, whose country had been 
exempted from the immigration restrictions, came for work, most 
as migrant farm laborers. Like African Americans, the Mexicans 
were generally tolerated, more than accepted, as a source of labor, 
and their lots would get worse as the 1920s ended.
Crashing with the Market
Few Americans actually had a direct stake in the stock market in 
1929. About 3 million people, or about 2.5 percent of the country’s 
population of 120 million, owned shares. Only half of those who did 
own stocks owned enough to involve a brokerage account. Playing 
the market was mostly a rich person’s game, with 30 percent of all 
1929 dividends going to families with annual incomes of more than 
$100,000.
But if they weren’t actually in the stock market, it seemed everyone 
talked about it. A visiting British journalist noted that whatever 
topic a conversation started with, “in the end you had to talk about 
the stock market, and that was when the conversation became 
serious.”

 Chapter 3: Prelude to Disaster: The Economy Prior to 1929 39
Buying into the market on credit
 
Both the wealthy and the wannabe wealthy often bought stock on 
credit. By putting just 10 percent down on a purchase, for example, 
a stock buyer could buy 10 times as much stock as he could afford 
out of his or her own pocket. (See the Chapter 2 discussion on 
buying on margin.) That was all right with brokers and other 
lenders because they were borrowing money from Federal Reserve 
banks at 5 percent and charging 12 percent or more to their 
clients. The total loaned by brokers rose from $4.4 billion at the 
beginning of 1927 to $8.5 billion in the fall of 1929.
The problem was that if brokers called in their loans, investors had 
to sell their stock at whatever price it was trading at to repay the 
money. If the stock was down, both the lender and the borrower 
could be in big trouble.
But there was certainly money to be made, at least for a while. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (a weighted average of 30 major 
companies’ stock prices) doubled from the beginning of 1928 to 
September 1929. But the market was fueled by speculation, not 
value. As long as stock prices kept going up, people weren’t much 
interested in what a company produced or if its products were 
turning a profit. So money kept pouring into the market.
 
“The ranks of the inexperienced — the ‘suckers’ — were swelled 
by numbers of men who had been attracted by newspaper stories 
of the big, easy profits to be made in a tremendous bull market,” 
a brokerage house observer wrote in a 1928 article in The Nation. 
“These amateurs were not schooled in markets that had seen 
stringent, panicky drops in prices. They came in on a rising tide.”
There were warnings that the tide of rising stock prices must 
inevitably recede. In March 1929, respected financier Paul M. 
Warburg wrote that “if orgies of unrestrained speculation are 
permitted to spread too far . . . the ultimate collapse is certain not 
only to affect the speculators themselves, but also to bring about a 
great depression involving the entire country.”
Getting gored by the bulls
October 24, 1929, was a cool and overcast Thursday on New York’s 
Wall Street. Inside the New York Stock Exchange, the morning’s 
session began more or less as usual. Then, at about 11 a.m., people 
began selling. And selling. And selling.

Part I: Heading into a Mess  
40
 
“The deluge broke,” New York Times reporter Elliott W. Bell wrote 
some years later. “It came with a speed and ferocity that left men 
dazed . . . it was the most terrifying and unreal day I have ever seen 
on the Street.”
When the session closed, a record 12.9 million shares had sold — 
so many that the ticker tape machine that relayed market prices 
around the country was more than four hours behind by the end of 
the day.
As the market sank on October 24, which came to be known as 
“Black Thursday,” a half dozen Wall Street bankers tried to calm 
things down by buying up shares. One of the bankers, Thomas W. 
Lamont, calmly told reporters “it seems there has been some 
distress selling in the market.”
 
The bankers’ effort failed. On October 29, which became known 
as “Black Tuesday,” another stock-selling stampede broke out. 
More than $9 billion (about $113 billion in 2008 dollars) was lost 
in a single five-hour period, and 16.4 million shares were sold, a 
record that would stand until 1978. Figure 3-1 offers a glimpse into 
the chaos that erupted that day. Before the market hit bottom in 
July 1932, its stock index (a measurement of the market’s value) fell 
from 452 to 58. It would take more than a decade to fully recover.

Contrary to popular myth, there was no mass exodus of despondent 
brokers and speculators through skyscraper windows. But it’s a 
safe bet that few investors felt like singing along to a new tune that 
had debuted at a Manhattan ballroom that week.
It was called “Happy Days Are Here Again.”
Lessons Learned
Following are two key lessons that Americans learned — or should 
have learned — from the events leading up to, and including, the 
stock market crash of 1929.
It’s easy to borrow, hard to repay
If there is one lesson to be learned from the 1920s, it’s that using 
credit to buy things can be a slippery slope to chronic debt.
When the Great Depression ended with the start of World War II, 
Americans who had lived through the hardest of hard times did 
become a nation of savers. Personal savings as a percentage of 
personal wealth reached a heady 26 percent during the war.
But after the war, consumerism collided with the ascension of 
credit cards that allowed repayment in installments. In 1978, a U.S. 
Supreme Court decision made it easier for banks to charge higher 
interest rates on credit cards and cross state lines in pursuit of 
customers. In the 1980s, rapidly rising inflation made the use of 
credit cards an attractive way to buy things before their prices 
went up. In the 1990s, home equity loans allowed consumers to tap 
money that they couldn’t otherwise access without selling their 
houses.
By the beginning of the 21st century, Americans didn’t even have 
to seek credit — it sought them through endless offers that even 
included paying off old credit cards with new ones. Many consumers 
developed a sense of entitlement. One college professor reported 
that his students referred to credit cards as “yuppie food stamps.”
The resulting numbers were both stunning and sobering:
 
✓ Consumer credit, not including mortgages, jumped from $700 
billion in 1988 to $2.6 trillion in 2008. Over the same period, 
the average personal savings rate dropped from 8 percent to 
less than 1 percent.

Part I: Heading into a Mess  
42
 
✓ In 2007, U.S. families were devoting 14 percent of their 
disposable income to paying off debt, the highest rate ever.
 
✓ From 2005 to 2008, the amount of credit card debt reported in 
personal bankruptcy filings tripled, to $61,000.
When the 2007 recession began, however, consumer credit began 
to dry up. Credit cards became harder to get, late payment fees 
increased, and down payments rose. In August 2008, consumer 
borrowing fell for the first time in a decade, indicating that — 
maybe — the credit lesson of the 1920s may be sinking in.
The stock market can go down
Could a big stock market crash happen again? Well, measured just 
by the size of the one-day decline in the stock market, it already 
did. On October 19, 1987, the market dropped 22.6 percent, far 
more than the 12.8 percent it dropped on October 29, 1929.
But after the 1987 crash, the various stock exchanges installed 
safeguards to protect against a complete meltdown. The safeguards 
included limiting computerized transactions in overheated selling 
sessions, requiring the markets to close after they fall by certain 
levels over a specified time, and requiring trading firms to have 
more capital available if there’s a run on the market. Congress has 
also created two agencies that keep an eye on things:
 
✓ The Securities Investor Protection Corporation: Established 
in 1970, the SIPC doesn’t provide insurance against broker 
fraud, but it does help investors recover their securities or 
cash when a brokerage firm is closed due to bankruptcy.
 
✓ The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: Formed in 
1934 to restore public confidence, the SEC regulates the 
stock market and the securities industry. The five-member 
commission oversees requirements that publicly traded 
companies disclose accurate information about their firms. It 
also investigates and brings civil prosecutions in fraud cases.
But even with all these safeguards available, it’s worth noting that 
a whole lot more people have something at stake: In the 1920s, 
around 2 percent of households had a stake in the market. In the 
2000s, more than 50 percent did.

Getting Depressed

In this part . . . 
M
ost Americans had no direct stake in the stock 
market crash of late 1929 and consequently had no 
idea what kind of economic tsunami was about to come 
down on them.
All too soon, they found out.
In this part, I look at both the causes of the Great 
Depression and the consequences, including the near-
collapse of the nation’s banking system, record unemploy-
ment, and the resulting crushing poverty that followed. I 
focus on the impact on the American family, the devasta-
tion suffered by U.S. farmers, and — oh yeah — how the 
rest of the world was getting along.

T
he Great Depression may have started with the stock market 
crash in October 1929 (see Chapter 3), but the crash didn’t 
shoulder all the blame.
In this chapter, I look at some of the contributing factors to the 
creation of the Great Depression, the early and abortive attempts 
to deal with it, the collapse and resurrection of the U.S. banking 
system, and how the consequences of the crippled economy 
played out in the first few years after the stock market crash.
Analyzing What Happened
Explaining precisely what caused the Great Depression is like 
trying to nail an egg to the wall: messy and unfulfilling. In fact, 
historians and economists have argued with each other almost 
since the Great Depression started about precisely what caused it, 
and no one has yet come up with a universally accepted explanation.
It’s reasonably safe to say that a combination of factors contributed 
to the sharp economic downturn that began in late 1929, including 
the bursting of the speculation bubble in the stock market, a drop 
in consumer spending, a rotten banking system, and too many 
poor people.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
46
These factors were aggravated by tardy, insufficient, and misdirected 
efforts to fix things. The result was that a nasty recession turned 
into a ten-year economic ordeal.
Here’s a look at some of the ingredients that created this economic 
stew:
 
✓ The stock market crash: In addition to financially wiping out 
tens of thousands of individual investors and speculators, the 
collapse of the market crippled banks that had made loans 
secured by stocks. It also greatly reduced public confidence 
in the economy, which meant people reduced their spending 
and investing.
 
✓ Too much stuff: In the 1920s, technological advances and 
innovative manufacturing techniques, such as mechanized 
assembly lines, meant U.S. workers were making things faster. 
In fact, they were making things too fast. Estimates indicate 
that by 1929, the country was producing 17 percent more 
than it could buy. The result of all this overproduction was a 
sudden halt to manufacturing in many areas when the economy 
slowed. That halt led to layoffs and higher unemployment, 
which naturally led to even less buying.
 
✓ Too many poor people: Most of the nation’s personal wealth 
was concentrated in the pockets of relatively few people. In 
1929, 40 percent of U.S. families had annual incomes below 
the federal poverty level. They could buy very little, and 
richer people couldn’t buy enough to make up the difference. 
By 1930, the result was deflation: oversupplies of goods, lower 
prices, lower wages, and higher unemployment. See Chapter 3 
for more details on the over-concentration of wealth.
 
✓ Failure on the farm: Agriculture was a major element of the 
economy. In 1929, 25 percent of U.S. jobs were still on the 
farm. But overproduction, low crop prices, foreign competition, 
disastrous weather, and lack of credit all combined to make a 
mess of agriculture. See Chapter 6 for a longer look at the fate 
of farmers in the Great Depression.
 
✓ Other countries: Much of Europe suffered a major economic 
hangover throughout the 1920s from the horrors of World 
War I. The United States made efforts to cure that hangover 
with loans during and after the war — $27 billion from 1914 
to 1929 — most of which weren’t repaid. But U.S. loans began 
to dry up in the late 1920s as American dollars were diverted 
into the overheated stock market.

 Chapter 4: Going Bust: A Depression Is Born 47
 
 That situation made it hard for other countries to buy U.S. 
products. The problem got much worse in 1930, when 
Congress approved a bill that steeply raised tariffs (taxes 
charged on imported goods). Other countries retaliated with 
their own tariffs, and international trade slowed to a trickle.
Putting a Happy Face 
on a Gloomy Economy
In June 1930, a group of clergymen visited the White House, hoping 
to persuade President Herbert Hoover to expand a federal public 
works program and put more people to work.
“Gentlemen,” Hoover told them, “you have come 60 days too late. 
The depression is over.”
It wasn’t, of course. But Hoover wasn’t alone in his cheery statements 
in the months following the collapse of the stock market. Other 
officials and academics pronounced that the “economic correction” 
(Hoover used the term “depression” because he thought it 
sounded better than “panic” or “crisis”) would start getting better 
any day. They pointed to a brief — and only temporary — rally 
in the market in spring 1930 as proof things were turning around. 
Business leaders made public pledges to enlarge their enterprises. 
Henry Ford even pledged to raise wages for his workers to $7 a day.
The media did its part to accentuate the positive. The New York 
Times declared the most important story of 1929 was not the stock 
market crash but the Antarctic expedition of Admiral Richard 
Byrd. In its December 1930 issue, Fortune magazine hyperbolized 
that “to compute the total construction investment of U.S. industry 
in 1930 would be a mathematical undertaking of colossal complexity.”
 
But the numbers told a much less rosy story. Private capital 
investment (money spent for fixed assets such as land, buildings, 
or machinery) fell from $35 billion in 1929 to $23 billion in 1930, on 
its way to an emaciated $3.9 billion in 1932. One survey showed 
the earnings of 200 non-automotive companies declined 19 percent 
in the first three months of 1930 compared to 1929. Auto company 
earnings plummeted 40 percent in that same period.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
48
While Ford did raise wages, he did so by giving raises to some 
workers and laying off others. Then he contracted the work of 
those people who had been laid off to other companies, which paid 
their workers as little as $1 a day. Such tactics helped nearly triple 
the number of unemployed Americans, from 1.5 million in 1929 to 
4.3 million in 1930.
As the reality of the situation began to sink in, many of Hoover’s 
top aides, particularly Treasury secretary Andrew Mellon, advised 
the president to do nothing. Business leaders joined the chorus.
 
“The fact that we have let nature take its course may augur well 
for the ultimate prosperity of the country,” said New York Stock 
Exchange president Richard Whitney. Others saw that approach 
as a convenient cover for not having a clue how to fix things. “The 
great advantage of allowing nature to take its course is that it 
obviates thought,” observed economics writer Stuart Chase.
 
Hoover did make some efforts (which are covered in more detail 
in Chapter 12). He tried to coax business leaders into maintaining 
wage rates. He expanded federal public works projects. He asked 
the Federal Reserve System to ease credit requirements and lower 
interest rates. He promoted a national charity drive in the winter of 
1929–30 (which raised an anemic $15 million).
But nothing seemed to help. In mid-January 1931, former President 
Calvin Coolidge came up with the understatement of the decade in 
his syndicated newspaper column. “The country,” he wrote, “is not 
in good condition.”
Banking in Ruins
The U.S. banking industry wasn’t in such great shape even before 
the onset of the Great Depression. Between 1865 and 1920, banks 
had closed at an average rate of about 57 a year. In the Roaring 
Twenties, however, the average jumped to 635 closures a year.
Most of the banks that closed were small rural operations that 
were usually underfunded and overly ambitious when it came to 
investments. These banks were often operated by people who 
were crooked, stupid, or both. Senator Carter Glass of Virginia 
sniffed that such banks were “pawn shops (run) by little corner 
grocery-men calling themselves bankers.”

 Chapter 4: Going Bust: A Depression Is Born 49
Reacting to the crash
After the stock market crash, things only got worse for banks. 
Some of those that had made large investments in the market or 
issued loans to brokers and speculators closed. That made 
depositors at other banks nervous, and they began withdrawing 
their money to store it under the mattress or bury it in the backyard.
Banks tried to meet the demand for cash by selling off their bonds 
and real estate holdings, often at a loss, which made their financial 
condition even worse.
 
The number of failed banks soared to more than 1,300 in 1930, 600 
of them in the last two months of the year. More than 2,000 failed 
in 1931, and more than 3,000 in 1932. In those three years, they 
took with them more than $2 billion in depositors’ savings — $28.4 
billion in 2008 dollars.
Many of the banks were small and in rural areas or small towns 
and cities. But on December 11, 1930, the Bank of United States in 
New York City closed. The failure wiped out $200 million belonging 
to more than 400,000 depositors, many of them immigrants. It was 
the largest commercial bank failure in U.S. history.
The bank might have been saved with help from other banks in the 
city, but the other banks refused. Some historians have attributed 
the refusal to the fact that the Bank of United States’s principals, as 
well as many of its customers, were Jewish. Whatever the reason, 
the failure only increased the public’s distrust of banks — and its 
dislike of bankers.
A popular joke at the time went, “Don’t tell my mother I’m a 
banker, it would break her heart. She thinks I play the piano in a 
whore house.” A British visitor related that U.S. bankers were “the 
most despised and most detested group of men” in the country.
Digging a deeper hole
Some of the public’s antipathy was justified. At a U.S. Senate hearing 
in January 1933, more than a few bankers admitted they had used 
bank funds to speculate in stocks, made unsecured “loans” to bank 
officials, evaded taxes, and used bank assets to set up outside 
companies they controlled.

The 16-year-old Federal Reserve Board could have helped by 
pumping more money into the economy and lowering interest 
rates to make it easier for banks to borrow. But unsure of its 
authority and disinterested in the plight of smaller banks that were 
not members of the system, the Fed failed to act decisively.
President Hoover first tried to get banks to help each other. 
When that effort failed, he pushed through the creation of the 
Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The RFC was designed to 
make loans to banks and other financial institutions so they 
could make loans to businesses. But businesses needed credit 
less than they needed customers, and banks weren’t anxious to 
extend themselves further by making loans.
So things got worse. People withdrew their money in fear their 
banks would close, often demanding payment in gold. Bank lobbies 
were jammed with panic-stricken customers.
The situation fostered some innovative thinking. A Utah bank 
manager tried to minimize the damage by instructing tellers to count 
out withdrawals as slowly as possible. A woman in New York City 
rented her baby to other customers for 25 cents: Holding a child in 
their arms entitled them to move to the front of the long lines.
But the crowds didn’t work out to everyone’s advantage. A would-be 
robber in Arkansas was thwarted because the bank was so 
crowded he couldn’t cover everyone: A customer slipped out and 
got the sheriff.
So much money was withdrawn and hoarded, it’s estimated that 
one-third of the nation’s money supply was out of circulation by 
the beginning of 1933. Some communities, such as Salt Lake City, 
resorted to creating their own currency, which was used to pay 
workers and was accepted by local businesses.
 
“Our banking system was the weakest link in our whole economic 
system,” Hoover later wrote in his memoirs. “(It was) the worst 
part of the dismal tragedy with which I had to deal.”
It was soon part of his successor’s new deal.
Taking a great bank holiday
As 1933 began, the country’s financial system was on the verge of 
collapse. In the first two months of the year, more than 4,000 banks 
closed their doors. In mid-February, Michigan Governor William A. 
Comstock declared a banking moratorium for the entire state. He 
called it a “bank holiday.”

 Chapter 4: Going Bust: A Depression Is Born 51
Other states followed. By March 4, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt 
was sworn in as the 32nd president of the United States, 38 of the 
48 states had declared partial or total “bank holidays.”
Roosevelt made it unanimous. The day after taking office, the new 
president issued an executive order closing banks across the 
country and banning the export of gold. The order was, legally 
speaking, a bit of a stretch of presidential power, so FDR also 
called Congress into special session to ratify his order.
In the meantime, Americans began coping with a severe cash 
shortage caused by the banks being closed. Remember, this was in 
the days before ATMs and credit cards:
 
✓ A boxing tournament at New York’s Madison Square Garden 
accepted false teeth, spark plugs, Bibles, and a box of egg 
noodles, among other things, in lieu of the 50-cent admission fee.
 
✓ A professional wrestler in Wisconsin signed a contract to 
perform in exchange for a can of tomatoes and a peck of 
potatoes.
 
✓ A newspaper in Ohio offered to trade ad space for produce.
The lack of change was a particularly vexing problem. Manhattan 
hotels sent bellboys to nearby churches to exchange bills for coins 
from the collection plates. Storekeepers in Elgin, Illinois, flocked to 
the house of a 16-year-old boy who, according to a local newspaper 
story, had collected 11,357 pennies toward his college education. 
And the country chuckled when it heard that for lack of change, 
the notoriously tight-fisted tycoon John D. Rockefeller had been 
forced to tip his golf caddy a dollar instead of his customary dime.
Federal bank officials, meanwhile, were trying to figure out how 
to get people to bring back to the banks all the gold and gold 
certificates they had withdrawn. On March 8, the Federal Reserve 
Board announced that lists would be made of everyone who had 
withdrawn gold after February 1 and not redeposited it by March 
13. The announcement sounded ominous, although there wasn’t 
any legal penalty for not redepositing the gold.
Breathing new life into the banks
On March 9, Congress approved the Emergency Banking Act of 
1933 — and it did so with lightning speed. Congress spent only 35 
minutes debating and voting on the bill, which was signed by FDR 
eight hours after it had been introduced.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
52
 
The act authorized what Roosevelt had already done. It also 
declared that banks could not be reopened until they had passed 
muster from an army of federal auditors that already had been 
dispatched to the nation’s 18,000-plus banks. The act extended 
the president’s authority over credit and currency and gave 
him the power to set gold and silver prices. It authorized the 
Reconstruction Finance Corporation to buy stock in banks to 
help shore them up. And it approved the printing of $2 billion in 
new currency, backed not by gold but by the assets of the banks. 
Naturally, the new bills were sent only to the banks that proved 
they had assets.
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing roared to life. By March 
11, planes were lifting off from Washington, D.C., to deliver the 
money. The next evening, Roosevelt spoke to the nation, via radio, 
to explain what had happened and to ask people to go back to the 
banks.
 
“I can assure you, my friends, that it is safer to keep your money 
in a reopened bank than it is to keep it under the mattress,” the 
president told an estimated audience of 60 million. “You people 
must have faith . . . we have provided the machinery to restore our 
financial system, and it is up to you to support and make it work.”
It worked. Hoarded gold and notes poured back into the banks. 
One Arizona bank reported taking in $640,000 in deposits the day 
after FDR’s speech, while paying out only $32,000 in withdrawals. 
By March 15, 69 percent of the country’s banks had reopened.
 
In June, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act, which established 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The FDIC was given 
authority to insure bank deposits up to $2,500 per depositor per 
bank. Federal oversight was extended to all commercial banks. The 
FDIC was funded by charging fees to financial institutions.
For all his zest for reforms, Roosevelt didn’t like the Glass-Steagall 
Act because he thought it represented too big a commitment for 
the federal government to make. But he signed the bill anyway, 
and it worked. Between 1921 and 1933, bank depositors had lost an 
average of $156 million a year. In 1934, the amount lost dropped to 
less than $1 million.

 Chapter 4: Going Bust: A Depression Is Born 53
Becoming Jobless, Homeless, 
and Hungry
On June 18, 1931, U.S. newspapers carried a brief story from 
the West African country of Cameroon. The story reported that 
members of the Bulu tribe had raised $3.77 and had given it to 
a Presbyterian Missions Board to help the down-and-out people 
in the United States. The gesture was made after the residents of 
Cameroon had read in a local paper that “there are actually people 
in America who do not have enough to eat.”
While the gesture may have amused some, what had motivated the 
Cameroonians was undeniably true: Some Americans were hungry, 
homeless, and unemployed. And it seemed that more people 
joined their ranks every day.
 
The writer Sherwood Anderson described watching “men who are 
heads of families creeping through the streets of American cities, 
eating from garbage cans; men turned out of houses and sleeping 
week after week on park benches, on the ground, in the mud under 
bridges . . . our streets are filled with beggars, with men new to the 
art of begging.”
Watching jobs disappear
As the Great Depression ground on, the grim employment statistics 
piled up:
 
✓ The number of businesses in the country dropped from 2.2 
million in 1929 to 1.9 million in 1933.
 
✓ Unemployment rates inexorably climbed: 1.5 million in 1929; 
4.3 million in 1930; 8 million in 1931; 12 million in 1932; 12.8 
million in 1933. By 1933, 24.9 percent of the entire civilian 
labor force was jobless.
 
✓ Total wages dropped from $50.4 billion in 1929 to $30 billion 
in 1932.
 
✓ Inflation-adjusted per capita income slumped from $681 in 
1929 to $495 in 1933. At the Depression’s depths, 28 percent of 
Americans had no income at all.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
54
The effects on some regions and communities were even more 
depressing than the big-picture numbers. By the end of 1931, 
unemployment in Chicago was at 40 percent, and it stood at 50 
percent in Detroit. In the steel town of Donora, Pennsylvania, it 
was estimated in 1932 that only 277 of the town’s 14,000 residents 
had jobs.
The interrelationships of industries exacerbated things. Steel 
production dropped because railroads shrank. In the 1920s, U.S. 
rail companies had purchased 1,300 locomotives a year. In 1932, 
they bought none. As farming shriveled, demand for fishmeal 
fertilizer and livestock feed waned. As a result, sardine prices 
dropped from $11 a ton to $6 a ton. As construction fell, lumber 
production declined with it. Washington State had produced 7.5 
billion board feet in the mid-1920s; in 1932, it produced 2 billion.
It was a buyer’s market for employers. New York City department 
stores, for example, required elevator operators to have college 
degrees and had no problems filling the jobs. Other employers 
cut wages to microscopic levels. Hourly rates fell to 10 cents for 
lumbering and 6 cents for brick-making. Garment workers were 
paid $2.39 for a 55-hour week.
The 50 percent of coal miners who weren’t out of work were paid 
$10.88 a month. And some weren’t even paid in U.S. currency, 
but company scrip, which could be spent only at company-owned 
stores.
 
In 1931, a Harlan County, Kentucky, miner wrote to federal officials: 
“We are half fed because we can’t feed ourselves and families with 
what we make. And we can’t go to a cut rate store and buy food 
because most all the company forbids such trading. If you got the 
cash. But now we have no cash. And the companies keeps their 
foodstuffs at high prices at all times. So you can not clear enough 
to go anywhere. And if you do go some where and buy food you 
are subject to be canned.”
If wages weren’t cut, the hours worked were. In 1932, U.S. factory 
workers averaged 32 hours of work a week, down from 44 in 1929. 
Other companies cut jobs in half, figuring it was better to employ 
two people half-time than have one go jobless.
While some employers cut wages and hours just to keep the doors 
open, others were unapologetic about exploiting the situation. 
The president of the National Association of Manufacturers, J.E. 
Edgerton, told a Senate committee that “I’ve never thought of 
paying men on the basis of what they need. I pay for efficiency. I 
attend to all those other things, social welfare stuff, in my church 
work.”

 Chapter 4: Going Bust: A Depression Is Born 55
President Herbert Hoover held a variation of that sentiment. He 
disliked wage cuts but disapproved of government interference in 
setting wages. But in June 1930, Hoover did approve $2.3 billion in 
public works projects to create jobs.
In October, he formed the President’s Emergency Committee 
for Employment. The committee came up with a list of inane 
recommendations (for example, the unemployed should spend 
less for food) and ran an equally inane advertising campaign to 
buck up the public’s morale. The committee’s director told a 
congressional committee, “I think that what we need is that 
everybody go back to work and have full pay for all jobs.”
But stating the obvious didn’t help much. Americans were willing 
to go to work, if they could find it. “I would be only too glad to dig 
ditches,” a North Carolina man wrote federal officials in 1933, “to 
keep my family from going hungry.”
An apple a day
In the fall of 1930, apple growers in the Pacific Northwest found themselves with a 
bumper crop. So someone at the International Apple Shippers Association came up 
with an idea: Why not marry the excess fruit, in an economic sense, with all those 
jobless people in the big cities of the East?
The idea caught on. People could buy a crate of about 60 apples for $1.75. At a 
nickel each, they could gross $3 a day and net $1.25. It wasn’t much, but it beat 
nothing at all.
By November 1930, city streets were packed with apple sellers. In New York City 
alone, there were an estimated 6,000, “some so near each other they could hold 
hands if they weren’t competitors,” in the words of one writer.
Journalist Frederic J. Haskin noted that “in the great industrial cities where 
thousands have been walking the streets, some for months, in search of work, apple 
selling is going forward briskly. One cannot walk a city square without encountering 
vendors of the fruit.”
In Akron, Ohio, city officials heard that some apple sellers were making $50 a week. 
So officials required the sellers to give up their spots every two weeks and let 
someone else have a chance.
Apple selling lasted only until the big crop ran out. A sign displayed by one seller 
summed up the experience: “We used to have to eat an apple a day to keep the 
doctor away. Now we have to sell a few apples a day to keep the wolf away.”

Moving to the streets
Higher unemployment meant more people without rent money or 
mortgage payments, which meant more people became homeless. 
By the end of 1931, hundreds of thousands were on the street or 
living in temporary shelters.
In Philadelphia, there were as many as 1,300 evictions a month. 
Children in a daycare center played a game that involved moving 
toy furniture from one corner of the room to another. “We ain’t got 
no money for the rent,” a child explained to a teacher, “so we’ve 
moved into a new house. Then we got the constable on us, so we 
moving again.”
In Chicago, Judge Samuel E. Heller presided over a landlord-
tenants court. “I had an average of four hundred cases a day,” he 
recalled several years later. “It was packed. People fainted, people 
cried ‘where am I going?’”
Many homeowners were scarcely better off than renters. Deflation 
was at work in the housing market as well as elsewhere in the 
economy. A house that had sold for $5,000 in 1926 might be worth 
$3,200 in 1932. Banks were often eager to unload properties as fast 
as they could when the mortgage got behind, before the property’s 
value declined further. By the end of 1933, it was estimated, as 
many as half of the home mortgages in the country were in default.
The homeless had few options, none of them attractive. For a dime, 
a single homeless man might get a bed for the night in a smelly 
and flea-ridden flophouse. If he didn’t have a dime, he might seek a 
resting place near the municipal incinerator. It meant sleeping on 
garbage, but at least it was warm.
For a family, if there were no friends or relatives to go to, moving 
into abandoned buildings was an option, but it meant living with 
no electricity or running water. Some cities had shelters, but stays 
in them were limited.
Then there were Hoovervilles: collections of shacks and sheds 
made of everything from flattened tin cans to packing crates, 
derisively named after the president. Virtually every big and 
medium-sized city had one, perched on vacant land usually on 
the outskirts of town. In Oakland, California, the “community” 
was situated around and inside large abandoned concrete sewer 
pipes. In San Francisco, it was a field of abandoned trolley cars. St. 
Louis had the largest Hooverville, with distinct “neighborhoods.” 
Charitable facilities that provided food — from soup kitchens to 
bread lines — were usually nearby.

 Chapter 4: Going Bust: A Depression Is Born 57
Although the tenants were technically trespassing, most cities 
were pragmatic enough to tolerate them, mostly because no one 
had a better idea that was economically practical. (In Seattle, city 
officials twice burned down the city’s Hooverville, and twice it was 
rebuilt.)
Local officials often did require that minimal health and safety 
regulations be met; for example, structures had to be built above-
ground and have windows, and trash and human waste had to be 
disposed of properly. Some Hoovervilles established their own 
governments and adopted rules and regulations. Structures were 
even bought and sold.
 
In 1933, the Federal Transient Program began. The program took 
different forms in different areas. In small towns, the federal 
government contracted with local charities, hotels, and restaurants 
to provide food and lodging. About 300 camps were established in 
rural areas using surplus Army equipment. The program’s facilities 
were efficiently maintained, and sometimes they provided work. 
By 1935, when it was phased out, the program had registered a 
million people and operated 600 centers.
In 1935, the Roosevelt administration shifted its focus to programs 
designed to keep families from becoming homeless in the first 
place. A sharp economic downturn in 1938 repopulated the 
nation’s homeless “towns,” but by the time the United States 
entered World War II in 1941, most of the Hoovervilles had been 
dismantled.
Going hungry
In mid-1933, Harry Hopkins, President Roosevelt’s top man when 
it came to relief programs, sent a former reporter named Lorena 
Hickok to travel around the country and report to him what she 
found.
Hickok found hunger. In West Virginia, she was told there were 
children that had never tasted milk. In Kentucky, she was told that 
five babies had starved to death in the ten days before she arrived. 
In South Dakota, she found farmers eating soup made from spiny 
Russian thistle.
 
“We have been eating wild greens, such as Polk salad,” a Kentucky 
coal miner wrote federal officials. “Violet tops, wild onions, forget-
me-nots, wild lettuce and such weeds as cows eat, as a cow won’t 
eat poison weeds.”

Part II: Getting Depressed  
58
That kind of desperate hunger in a nation that had fed itself and 
much of Europe, too, during World War I was hard to believe, so 
some chose not to believe it.
“Nobody is actually starving,” President Hoover told reporters in 
1932. “The hobos are actually better fed than they have ever been. 
One hobo in New York got ten meals in one day.”
 
But there were people starving, and tens of thousands more suffering 
from nutrition-related diseases such as pellagra and rickets. The 
New York City Welfare Council reported 29 cases of starvation in 
that city alone in 1932, with 110 more dead from malnutrition.
The author Thomas Wolfe wrote of watching “the homeless men 
who prowled in the vicinity of restaurants, lifting the lids of garbage 
cans and searching around inside for morsels of rotten food.”
In addition to grazing as the Kentucky miner’s family did, there 
were reports of orderly lines at refuse dumps as people waited 
their turn to scavenge the garbage. A Chicago widow told a social 
worker she always removed her glasses before cooking meat she 
had found, to avoid seeing the maggots.
Some of the more well-to-do and perhaps well-intentioned citizens 
instructed their servants to give their leftovers to the poor, and 
Hoover’s Secretary of War, Patrick Jay Hurley, even endorsed a 
suggestion for a federal program in which garbage from clubs, 
hotels, and restaurants would be collected in five-gallon containers 
and distributed to the needy by the Salvation Army. The idea was 
rejected.
Slightly less humiliating were the bread lines and soup lines that 
appeared in most cities and were sponsored by a combination of 
private donors and public agencies. Figure 4-1 depicts a typical 
bread line.
By the end of 1931, it was estimated that 85,000 meals a day were 
being served in New York City’s 82 bread lines. The two biggest 
were at Times Square and sponsored by newspaper tycoon William 
Randolph Hearst. In Chicago, top gangster Al Capone sponsored 
the largest line.
An observer of a New York line wrote that “wretched men, many 
without overcoats or decent shoes, usually began to line up soon 
after six o’clock, in good weather or bad, rain or snow.”

 Chapter 4: Going Bust: A Depression Is Born 59
Figure 4-1: An aerial view of a New York City bread line in 1930, stretching the 
length of a block with tents set up for distribution.
Most disturbing was the impact hunger had on children. In 
October 1932, the New York City Health Department reported 
more than 20 percent of the children in the city’s public schools 
were suffering from malnutrition. A survey by the American Friends 
Service Committee of mining regions in five states concluded the per-
centage of hungry children was sometimes as high as 90 percent. 
The committee said the children suffered from “drowsiness, 
lethargy and sleepiness,” as well as mental disabilities. A Chicago 
principal told a congressional committee in 1932 that he instructed 
his teachers to ask an unruly child what he had had for breakfast 
before disciplining him, “which usually brings out the fact that he 
has had nothing at all.”
A story widely reported in the 1930s concerned a West Virginia 
teacher who told an ill-looking child she should go home and eat 
something. The girl replied, “I can’t. This is my sister’s day to eat.”
In 1933, Congress approved the Federal Emergency Relief Act, 
which was designed to pump federal aid for food, clothing, and 
other necessities through state and local governments. The act, 
which provided $500 million in aid, is covered in Chapter 13.

Marching on Washington
The lack of a coherent and forceful plan to combat the nation’s 
deep troubles began to stir unpleasant thoughts of revolution in 
1932.
Magazine and journal articles debated the chances of a mass 
insurrection. Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak told a House committee 
that the federal government could send relief to Chicago — or it 
could send troops to quell the violence that would follow if no 
relief came. A labor leader warned a Senate committee that if 
nothing was done, “and starvation is going to continue, the doors 
of revolt in this country are going to be thrown open.”
In fact, there were sporadic incidents of violence and looting, much 
of it ignored by the newspapers for fear of encouraging copycat 
actions. But nothing occurred on a scale large enough to suggest 
an organized revolt until the “Bonus Army” reached Washington, 
D.C., in the summer of 1932.
The “Army” was a group of about 20,000 military veterans from 
around the country who wanted to accelerate the payment of 
bonuses they had been promised by Congress in 1924 for service 
during World War I. The bonuses were scheduled to be paid in 
1945, but hard times had prompted the vets to seek immediate 
payment.
The veterans made camp around Washington, with the main 
settlement at a place called Anacostia Flats, across the Potomac 
River from the Capitol, and they waited. On June 17, the House 
voted to pay the bonuses, but the Senate rejected the idea. About 
half of the vets went home, but the rest stayed.
On July 28, Washington, D.C., police were ordered to evict the 
remaining veterans. A fight broke out, and two vets were shot 
and killed. President Hoover, who had refused to meet with the 
veterans (although he did offer them $100,000 in aid if they would 
disperse), ordered the army to clear them out.
Under the command of Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur 
and backed by six tanks, infantry and cavalry charged into veterans 
massed along Pennsylvania Avenue. Ignoring orders from Hoover 
to stay out of the main camp, MacArthur had the settlement 
burned. Two babies in the camp died from tear gas, a 7-year-old 
boy trying to rescue a pet rabbit was bayoneted in the leg, and 
hundreds were injured.

 Chapter 4: Going Bust: A Depression Is Born 61
Administration officials tried to justify the attack. A War 
Department official called the vets “a mob of tramps and hoodlums, 
with a generous sprinkling of communist agitators.” MacArthur 
insisted that if the vets had not been routed, “I believe the institutions 
of our government would have been severely threatened.”
But newsreels, photos, and news accounts of the attack sickened 
many Americans.
 
“Soup is cheaper than tear gas bombs,” New York Representative 
Fiorello La Guardia said in a telegram to Hoover, “and bread is 
better than bullets in maintaining law and order in these times of 
depression, unemployment and hunger.”
Lessons Learned
Some lessons are learned the hard way, and two lessons from the 
Great Depression were learned in the hardest of ways.
It took the loss of the life savings of hundreds of thousands of 
Americans to win the creation of a national insurance program for 
bank deposits. And the hesitant and wrongly directed efforts of the 
Hoover Administration in response to the economic mess taught 
future administrations to move quicker — and in the opposite 
direction — when the U.S. economy was on the skids.
Safeguarding savings: The FDIC
Created by Congress in the wake of the 1933 banking industry 
crisis, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is basically just 
what the name implies: a U.S. government corporation that insures 
deposits at banks and financial institutions that are members.
Starting with maximum coverage of $2,500 per customer per 
bank on January 1, 1934, the FDIC now insures up to $250,000 
per investor per bank. (That amount is scheduled to decrease to 
$100,000 in January 2010.)
Keep in mind that the insurance amount is not per account, 
but per investor. For example, if you have $80,000 in a checking 
account (congratulations!), $100,000 in a savings account, and 
$100,000 in a certificate of deposit (CD) all at one bank, you’d have 
$280,000, which means $30,000 wouldn’t be covered. But if you and 
your spouse are joint holders of those three accounts, then the 
total amount would be covered because each of you is entitled to 
up to $250,000 in coverage.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
62
The FDIC is directed by a five-member board, appointed by the 
president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. No more than three 
board members can be of the same political party. The corporation 
has about 4,500 employees and insures funds in about 8,500 
institutions. Member banks pay insurance premiums and must 
meet minimum requirements for liquidity (availability of assets) 
and reserves.
The two most important things about the FDIC for most people to 
know are
 
✓ It does not cover stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or insurance 
annuities, even those that are purchased through an FDIC 
member bank.
 
✓ No one has ever lost a penny in an FDIC-insured account.
That’s not to say that banks don’t fail anymore. In fact, the longest the 
United States has gone without a bank failing since 1933 was from 
June 24, 2004, to February 2, 2007. From 1987 to 1989, slightly more 
than 200 banks per year failed, many of them in the Southwest, 
which suffered a sizeable slump in its energy industries. In July 
2008, FDIC regulators took over the IndyMac Bank in Pasadena, 
California. With $32 billion in assets, it was the third-largest bank 
failure in U.S. history. The two bigger ones were in 1984 and 1988.
But it’s probably safe to say that for all practical purposes, the U.S. 
government would have to fail before FDIC-insured deposits would 
be at great risk (which may or may not be of comfort to you).
Reacting to economic downturns
Since the Great Depression, the federal government’s response 
to downturns in the economic cycle has generally taken one of, 
or some combination of, three forms: lowering interest rates to 
encourage more borrowing and private investment; increasing 
government spending, either through public works projects or tax 
cuts; and maintaining and expanding “safety net” programs such as 
welfare and unemployment insurance (see Chapter 5).
That’s pretty much the opposite of what the Federal Reserve 
Board and the Hoover administration did in the months following 
the October 1929 stock market crash, when they raised interest 
rates and taxes and rejected the ideas of more government 
spending and direct relief programs.

 Chapter 4: Going Bust: A Depression Is Born 63
Since the end of World War II, the trio of lower interest rates, 
government stimulus spending, and safety net programs has 
generally worked to minimize the impact of recessions, or at least 
helped shorten them. For example, after the 1987 stock market 
crash (which was actually bigger than 1929’s when measured by 
the percentage of value lost), the Federal Reserve Board quickly 
lowered interest rates and increased liquidity in the financial 
system until it was clear there wasn’t going to be a major economic 
meltdown.
In the face of the severe economic recession that began in late 
2007, both the administrations of President George W. Bush and 
President Barack Obama employed combinations of tax cuts and 
public works spending, lowered interest rates, and expanded 
public assistance programs.
That’s not to say that government tinkering hasn’t sometimes 
caused problems. Some economists contend that periodic efforts 
to slow inflation by tightening the money supply have helped 
trigger recessions. As one economist put it in 1997, “None of the 
U.S. (economic) expansions of the past 40 years have died in bed 
of old age; every one was murdered by the Federal Reserve.”
In general, however, the three-pronged approach of more govern-
ment spending, lower interest rates, and provision of safety 
net programs has helped stave off an economic crisis like that 
of the 1930s.

Coming Face to Face 
with Hard Times
In This Chapter
▶ Aiding the needy without the federal government’s help
▶ Creating work wherever possible
▶ Trying to cope with family pressures
▶ Struggling to survive as minorities
▶ Lessons learned
T
he Great Depression deeply affected not only the U.S. economy 
but also the American psyche. The widely held belief that hard 
work and a responsible attitude would result in a comfortable and 
secure life (if not always wild success) was challenged by forces 
that seemed out of the control of everyone.
In this chapter, I show you how hard it was for some Americans to 
accept help, how hard it was for the federal government to give it 
(at least under Herbert Hoover), and how local governments and 
private sources tried to fill the gap. You also find out how people 
adapted to the times in their day-to-day lives, how traditional 
family relations and social institutions were affected, and how 
things got worse for those already at the bottom of the economy.
Looking for Relief
Since colonial times, Americans had had a high regard for standing 
on their own feet and a deep aversion to asking for help. In 1835, 
the French social scientist Alexis de Tocqueville noted how 
deeply ingrained the trait of individualism was in Americans. 
Individualism, he wrote, “is a mature and calm feeling, which 
disposes each member of the community to sever himself from the 
mass of his fellows, and to draw apart with his family and friends.”

66
In October 1928, Republican presidential candidate Herbert Hoover 
gave a speech that extolled “the American system of rugged 
individualism” over the “European philosophy” of “paternalism 
and socialism.” Hoover said “our country has become the land of 
opportunity to those born without inheritance, not merely because 
of the wealth of its resources and industry, but because of this 
freedom of initiative and enterprise.”
When Hoover was confronted as president with the grim reality 
that millions of Americans needed help that was beyond their 
abilities to provide for themselves, his first impulse was to deflect 
the responsibility to state and local public and private agencies.
 
“The basis of successful relief in national distress is to mobilize 
and organize the infinite number of agencies of relief help in the 
community,” Hoover said in February 1931. “This has been the 
American way of relieving distress among our people, and the 
country is successfully meeting its problem in the American way 
today.”
He was partially right. The traditional way of handling hard times 
was to do so at the local level. Except for a few natural disasters, 
the federal government had steered clear of providing direct relief 
(that is, food, clothing, shelter, cash, and other necessities of daily 
life). But Hoover was wrong in contending that the country was 
“successfully meeting its problem.”
Trying to help at the local level
The failure to provide enough help didn’t result from lack of trying. 
In April 1931 in Portland, Oregon, voters approved a $2 million 
bond issue for relief programs. In Fort Wayne, Indiana, private 
fundraising drives raised $775,000. In Boston, city employees 
contributed one day’s pay to a relief fund that collected $3 million.
Newspapers across the country called on their readers to find 
odd jobs or home repair chores for an out-of-work neighbor. The 
Moberly, Missouri, Monitor-Index, for example, announced on April 
3, 1931, that the local Salvation Army was organizing a spring 
cleaning week: “A list of worthy unemployed is being compiled at 
the organization’s headquarters, and residents will be asked to 
call on these unemployed for help in spring housecleaning, lawn 
raking, garden planting, cleaning basements and other spring 
improvements.”
On the same day in Jefferson City, Missouri, a city alderman 
proposed temporarily raising the town’s gasoline tax by two cents 
to finance some street repairs. The Jefferson City Post-Tribune 
reported that Alderman B.F. Reed “said the plan would result in 

 Chapter 5: Coming Face to Face with Hard Times 67
the employment of forty or fifty men, which, he said is the principal 
object for the suggestion.”
But local government and private relief efforts fell light-years short 
of meeting the need. In 1932, the total combined amount raised by 
charities and the municipal government in New York City reached 
$79 million. That was less than the city’s army of unemployed had 
lost in wages in one month. In Chicago, it was estimated that lost 
wages were averaging $2 million a day, while relief funds were 
averaging only $100,000 daily.
“I am stating that the funds we have are altogether inadequate to 
meet the situation,” Arthur T. Burns, the head of the Association of 
Community Chests and Councils, told a Senate committee in 1931.
Churches had suffered declining attendance — and leaner collection 
plates — throughout the 1920s, and most were in no position to 
extend substantial aid. States likewise were mostly broke in 1931, 
or close to it. With the exception of New York (where Governor 
Franklin D. Roosevelt had put together a competent relief agency), 
state relief programs were minimal.
 
The unemployment problem, meanwhile, was massive. By March 
1933, about one of every four able-bodied, working-age Americans 
was jobless. Because most of them were men with families to 
support, that statistic meant that as many as 40 to 50 million 
people — from 30 to 40 percent of the entire U.S. population — 
had no regular source of income.
“We can no longer depend on passing the hat and rattling the tin 
cup,” wrote William Allen White, the nationally known editor of the 
Emporia (Kansas) Gazette, in calling for federal intervention. “We 
have gone to the bottom of the barrel.”
Getting the feds involved . . . slowly
Hoover remained stubbornly opposed to direct federal relief. His 
opposition wasn’t based on a callous disregard for people’s troubles. 
But he feared that federal relief programs would create a permanent 
underclass of Americans dependent on government handouts. He was 
also nervous about deciding questions such as who would get help 
first, how much help they would get, and for how long. And he was 
dubious about the federal government’s ability to pay for it.
In February 1931, Hoover said that if the time ever came that local 
and state governments failed to have enough “resources with 
which to prevent hunger and suffering . . . I will ask the aid of every 
resource of the federal government.” But, he added, he had “faith 
in the American people that such a day never come.”

Part II: Getting Depressed  
68
In March 1931, Hoover vetoed a bill that would have provided loans to 
needy veterans. “I regard the bill as unwise,” he wrote in his veto 
message. “Of much greater importance is the whole tendency to 
open up the federal treasury to a thousand purposes . . . each of them 
breaks the barrier of self-reliance and self-support in our people.”
But Congress overrode Hoover’s veto, and the president grudgingly 
acquiesced to the idea of the federal government providing some 
help. Even then, however, it wasn’t direct help. In early 1932, Hoover 
signed into law the establishment of the Reconstruction Finance 
Corporation. The RFC helped prop up banks and other businesses 
with federal loans, but it did little to help the jobless guy on the street.
As humorist Will Rogers put it, “the money was all appropriated 
for the top, in the hopes it would trickle down to the needy.” But 
little trickling occurred, and jobless men waited for help.
Facing a reelection campaign and under increasing pressure from 
rival Democrats in Congress, Hoover finally agreed to expand the 
powers of the RFC so it could assist states in providing direct relief 
to people. But it was too little — only $30 million was spent by the 
end of 1932 — and too late for Hoover, who lost the presidential 
election to New York Governor Roosevelt.
In the early weeks of 1933, just prior to taking office, Roosevelt was 
absorbed by the nation’s banking crisis (see Chapter 4 for details). 
But other administration officials brought the issue of relief to the 
front burner — even those who weren’t known for their zeal for 
social issues.
 
“When we were campaigning,” said FDR’s crusty vice president, 
John Nance “Cactus Jack” Garner, “we sort of made promises that 
we would do something for the poorer kind of people, and I think 
we have to do something for them.”
Roosevelt agreed. Less than three weeks after taking office 
in March, FDR asked Congress to create the office of Federal 
Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) and to give it $500 million 
to provide grants to states.
Some congressional Republicans were apoplectic at the idea. “I can 
hardly find parliamentary language to describe the statement that 
the states and cities cannot take care of conditions in which they 
find themselves, but must come to the federal government for aid,” 
said Senator Simeon D. Fess of Ohio. Representative Robert Luce 
of Massachusetts declared, “[I]t is socialism. Whether it is 
communism I do not know.”

 Chapter 5: Coming Face to Face with Hard Times 69
Despite such bombastic indignation, the proposal easily passed 
both houses by the end of April 1933. How well it worked is covered 
in Chapter 13, along with other programs in Roosevelt’s “New Deal.”
The Arkansas “food riot”
On the cool and cloudy afternoon of January 3, 1931, Homer C. Coney decided he 
had been patient long enough.
Coney, a 46-year-old father of five, grew corn and cotton on 41 acres he rented 
near the central Arkansas town of England. A severe drought the previous summer 
had ruined Coney and other farmers in the area, and with no government aid on the 
horizon, his family was trying to make do on $12 a month from the Red Cross.
When a neighbor came by to beg, saying she and her two children hadn’t eaten for 
two days, Coney loaded up his truck with other men and drove into England. They 
demanded food from Red Cross officials, who contended they lacked the necessary 
application forms to issue anything.
“Our children are crying for food and we are going to get it,” one farmer said. 
“We’re not beggars (but) we are not going to let our families starve!”
As the crowd swelled to several hundred, town merchants defused the situation by 
opening their stores and providing food and clothing. A part-time reporter for the 
Associated Press phoned in the story, dramatically — and erroneously — describ-
ing it as a “riot.” But the exaggeration got the incident front-page play across 
the country and triggered an outpouring of small donations: $25 from a Winder, 
Georgia, manufacturing company; $5 from a man in Bridgeport, Connecticut; four 
pairs of socks and shoes from a couple in El Paso, Texas.
The story also caught the attention of arguably the best-liked man in America in 
1931. Homespun humorist Will Rogers was a star of stage, screen, and radio, and 
he also wrote a nationally syndicated newspaper column. On January 7, he wrote, 
“it took a little band of 500 simple country people . . . to come to a country town store 
and demand food for their wives and children. They hit the hearts of the American 
people more than all your Senatorial pleas and government investigations. Paul 
Revere woke up Concord. These birds woke up America.”
Rogers went to England, and then to the White House. After President Herbert 
Hoover turned down his appeal for direct aid to the region, Rogers organized a 
grueling 18-day, 50-show fundraising tour that raised more than $200,000. England 
pulled through.
In August, Rogers noted in another column that the farmers of England had sent 13 
truckloads of food to struggling coal miners in Oklahoma.
“Say, you talk about a people and a place being appreciative of what was done for 
them when they was in trouble,” Rogers wrote. “Now that’s remembering, ain’t it?”

Swallowing pride to 
keep from starving
Americans’ allegiance to the tenets of individualism and self-reliance 
were never more evident than in the resistance of so many people 
to accept relief when it was offered.
 
“We lived on bread and water for three weeks before I could make 
myself do it (accept relief),” a New Orleans man told a federal 
investigator in 1933. An unemployed schoolteacher in Texas told 
another investigator, “If I can’t make a living, I’m just no good I 
guess.” In Pennsylvania, when an investigator asked a half-dozen 
unemployed miners what the government could do for them, one 
miner replied in broken English, “[W]ork! Give man work, that’s all, 
no want relief if get work!”
Those who were less affected by the hard times, but who had been 
raised on the same ideal of self-reliance, sometimes reacted as if 
the country’s problems were made worse by efforts to help the 
poor and unemployed.
“To give a gratuity to an individual is divesting men and women of 
their spirit, their self-reliance,” said Patrick Jay Hurley, Hoover’s 
Secretary of War, in June 1932. “It is striking at the very foundation 
of the system on which the nation is built.”
Some of the down-and-out agreed. Frank Moorhead, a laid-off 
magazine editor, wrote in a 1931 article in The Nation that to keep 
up appearances, he set up an “office” in his home. There he would 
type randomly for hours, so neighbors would think he was working.
“I should like to find out at what stage of your poverty other 
people realize or sense it,” he wrote. “I guess, after all, it’s in the 
droop of the shoulders, the look in your eyes — furtive, expectant, 
resentful.”
But for every Patrick Jay Hurley who seemed to consider poverty 
a moral defect, or every Frank Moorhead who stigmatized himself, 
there were others who saw the needy as neither more nor less 
than the products of very hard times.
 
“Three or four million heads of families don’t turn into tramps or 
cheats overnight,” wrote top Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins in 1933. 
“An eighth or tenth of the earning population does not change its 
character, which has been generations in the moulding.”

 Chapter 5: Coming Face to Face with Hard Times 71
Changing with the Times
Many people who were out of a job, and who were unwilling or 
unable to get government help, created their own ways of making 
a buck.
Tapping the entrepreneurial spirit
Some enterprises were offshoots of people’s normal occupations. 
Coal miners, for example, smuggled coal out of the mines in 
lunch buckets or dug it out of company land after dark and 
then sold it on the black market. These coal “bootleggers” even 
formed an organization called the Independent Anthracite Miners 
Association. The association’s articles of incorporation stated 
that “we must dig the coal out of these mountains as a means of 
supplementing our measly income . . . in order to keep the wolf 
from our doorsteps.”
Some people shined shoes: The New York Times reported counting 
19 shoe shiners, ranging in age from 16 to 70, on one block of a 
Manhattan street in the summer of 1932. Other people sold things 
door to door: The Fuller Brush Company had so many salesmen — 
strictly on commission — that it was one of the relatively few firms 
in the 1930s to consistently make money.
Somewhat incongruously, given the hard times, people paid good 
money to watch other people do strange things. For example, 
boys climbed trees and tried to set endurance records for sitting 
in them, while passersby dropped coins in a box. Sometimes the 
tree sitters wore advertising for a local merchant. It apparently 
paid better than one would think. The Literary Digest reported in 
July 1933 that “the bank accounts of the numerous contestants . . . 
are not to be dismissed with a shrug.” To read about other wacky 
things people did for money, see the nearby sidebar “Endurance 
for sale.”
Hundreds of men wandered into old gold and silver mining 
regions in Colorado, Arizona, and California, looking as much 
for something to do as for precious metals. “We were more like 
scavengers,” television journalist Eric Sevareid wrote in his 1946 
memoir of being “on the bum” during the Great Depression. “The 
hope of finding gold, which almost none of us ever did, was more 
of an excuse to live in the hills, where life was cheap.”

72
Making do with what you had
An optimist in the 1930s might have pointed out that if half the 
families in the United States were without income, it meant half 
did have some money coming in. And it’s true that many American 
families didn’t lose their homes, go on relief, or find themselves 
rooting through their neighbors’ garbage cans for food.
Even so, the shaky economy, the unsettled political climate, and 
the shock of going from the seemingly shiny prosperity of the 
1920s to the decidedly gloomy atmosphere of the 1930s all made 
for a general feeling of uncertainty.
Endurance for sale
Americans in the 1930s had what Time magazine referred to as an “appetite for 
preposterous endurance.” It was an appetite sated by the willingness of some 
people to walk, dance, rollerskate, or bicycle for days and weeks on end in hopes 
of winning some money.
While there were variations on the theme, the basic premise was that a promoter 
invited individuals, couples, or teams to compete in activities ranging from kissing 
to sitting in rocking chairs. The promoter sold tickets to people who wanted to 
watch, and the contestants who lasted the longest at the activity won cash prizes. 
Roller Derby winners could make $1,000 for first place. Marathon dancers might 
average $20 to $30 a day in tips, and free meals, for as long as they could stay on 
their feet.
In addition to prizes for lasting the longest, competitors could also earn money from 
the crowds for an especially good effort or for some extra form of entertainment, 
such as singing. And there were often very big crowds. A Roller Derby held in 
Chicago in late 1935 and early 1936 drew 10,000 people a day.
While they may sound like quaint versions of American Idol, the competitions could 
be brutal. Bicycle races were usually six days long with competitors hurtling around 
an oval wooden track hour after hour, occasionally at speeds approaching 30 mph. 
Roller Derbies, on similar tracks, covered 4,000 miles. And dance marathons could 
drag on for months. One critic labeled them “a macabre modern equivalent of a 
homicidal Roman gladiatorial spectacle.”
Of course, not everyone was there for the spectacle. As a New York City reporter 
pointed out in 1933, a ticket to a six-day bicycle race cost $2.40, which was cheaper 
than most accommodations in the city: “It insures a gent some shelter, warmth, a 
bench and a certain amount of excitement if you like that sort of thing.”

 Chapter 5: Coming Face to Face with Hard Times 73
 
In that atmosphere, even people with incomes economized. Many 
families planted gardens and did more canning and preserving 
food. They made more of their own clothes. Telephones were 
deemed less necessary: The number of phones in service nationally 
dropped from 20 million in 1930 to fewer than 17 million in 1933. 
Automobiles remained a vital part of American life, but fewer of 
the cars were new. In 1929, 4.4 million new cars were sold. In the 
1930s, the annual number averaged 2.1 million. Book sales dropped 
50 percent.
Getting sick was not an economically healthy thing to do. “You had 
to have money to be sick,” the novelist John Steinbeck recalled. 
“Dentistry was out of the question, with the result that my teeth 
went badly to pieces.”
Some people dealt with the drooping economy by creating their 
own economies. Barter systems — in which people traded goods 
and services with each other — sprang up around the country. 
Sometimes it was a straight swap: You fix my roof, and I’ll give you 
some of my backyard rutabagas. In larger systems, scrip was used 
as a form of currency that could be exchanged for goods and services 
from anyone who was part of the system. A Washington state 
system used wooden nickels; a California system used seashells; 
an Oregon system used “rubber checks” — made of rubber.
At their peak in the early to mid-1930s, barter systems probably 
covered a million Americans in 30 states. A typical exchange, 
described in a 1939 paper by California social economist Clark Kerr 
(later chancellor of the University of California), worked like this: 
A music teacher owed $200 to a doctor. The barter cooperative 
she belonged to sent her three students, who paid her in scrip. 
She used the scrip to pay the doctor, who used it to get maid and 
stenographic services and new car tires from other members of 
the cooperative.
The systems worked on a limited basis but were no substitute 
for the real thing. As one observer put it, barter was “comparable 
to the relief a starving dog might get by eating his own tail.”
Taking a Toll on the 
American Family

1939 novel about a family of migrant farmers during the Great 
Depression, the family’s patriarch is talking to his wife.

“I ain’t no good any more,” Pa Joad says. “Funny! Woman takin’ 
over the fambly. Woman sayin’ we’ll do this here, an’ we’ll go 
there. An’ I don’t even care.”
Eroding men’s self-worth
A lot of Depression-era men could empathize with Pa Joad. Many, 
if not most, men drew their self-esteem and authority as head of 
the household from the fact that they were nearly always the sole 
breadwinners in the family.
Having no job meant more than having no money. It meant a loss 
of purpose and a diminution of the man’s role in the family. Mom 
did all the things that made the household function. Dad, if he 
was unemployed, was apt to sit around the kitchen table and sink 
deeper into depression.
That personal depression might deepen if Mom found a job, which 
was not an easy task. The percentage of the workforce made up of 
women increased only slightly from 1930 to 1940, from 24.3 percent 
to 25.1 percent. (In contrast, the percentage was 46.5 percent in 
2008.) Women were often discriminated against in the workplace 
because of fears that they might usurp the rightful place of men. 
Many employers who hired single women, including school districts, 
would often fire them if they married working men and thus 
created two-income families. There was a federal rule against two 
people in the same family working for the government.
Women were most often hired because they would accept lower 
pay — a practice not only allowed by federal law but also practiced 
by the federal government in its relief and jobs programs. In 
projects run by the federal Works Progress Administration, for 
example, men were paid $5 a day and women $3.
 
Some families faced double whammies. A Eureka, California, woman 
who worked at the county court house was married to a surveyor 
who lost his job. Then she got pregnant and had to leave her 
position. “I’m happy of course,” she wrote First Lady Eleanor 
Roosevelt in June 1934, seeking a government job for her husband, 
“but Tommy is nearly out of his head. He has tried every conceivable 
prospect, but you must know even pick and shovel jobs do not 
exist . . . A year is all I ask and after that I can go back to work and 
we can work out our own salvation. But to have this baby come to a 
home full of worry and despair, with no money for things it needs, it 
is not fair. It needs and deserves a happy start in life.”
Despite the extra pressures imposed on families by the economic 
stresses of the period, divorce rates actually declined, dropping 20 

 Chapter 5: Coming Face to Face with Hard Times 75
percent between 1929 and 1933. But that wasn’t necessarily good 
news. Men who saw themselves as failures because of unemployment 
often simply walked away and didn’t come back, a much cheaper 
alternative than a formal divorce.
Sometimes, as Figure 5-1 shows, the one thing that kept couples 
together was having nothing else.
Figure 5-1: An evicted Los Angeles couple sits on the curb surrounded by their 
belongings in 1937.
With the future so uncertain, marriage rates declined in the 1930s 
for the first time in the United States since the early 19th century. 
And birth rates dropped as well, from 25.1 per 1,000 population in 
1925 to 19.4 in 1940.
Even that number was too high for some women. For example, a 
Bakersfield, California, woman told federal investigator Lorena 
Hickok in 1933 that she worried about getting pregnant but 
couldn’t afford contraceptives.
 
“I suppose you can say the easiest way would be not to do it,” she 
said. “(But) you don’t know what it’s like when your husband is 
out of work. He’s gloomy all the time and unhappy. You haven’t 
any money for movies or anything to take his mind off his troubles. 
You must try all the time to keep him from going crazy. And many 
times — well, that is the only way.”

Hitting children the hardest
The domestic disruptions caused by the Great Depression were 
perhaps hardest on children, who had no concept of the economic 
forces that had put life in such disarray.
 
Some families had no recourse but to commit their children to 
orphanages or similar institutions. A veteran social worker told 
a Senate Committee in 1933 that the number of children who had 
been given up by their parents had risen from 284,000 in mid-1930 
to 400,000 in October 1932.
 
“It is the belief of those familiar with the facts that this increase . . . 
has been caused chiefly by the breaking up of family groups caught 
in the Depression and unable to care for their children because of 
inadequate relief or other conditions precipitated by unemployment,” 
said Dr. Jacob Billikopf.
Newspapers routinely carried heart-wrenching stories of the 
crushing weight borne by some children:
 
✓ In January 1933, an 8-year-old boy in Big Spring, Texas, told 
a social worker who had come to his home that he felt it was 
wrong to go out and play when he should be tending to his 
father, who was ill with tuberculosis.
 
 “No school for this boy,” wrote a reporter for the Big Spring 
Herald who had accompanied the social worker. “Only barely 
enough food. A chilly damp little room in which to live. No 
mother to care for him. Nothing in his days except to sit 
beside his father and watch him die.”
 
✓ New York City columnist Gilbert Swan noted in February 1933 
that those without shelter in the city sometimes went to the 
Central Park or Bronx zoo, where buildings were kept warm to 
protect the animals.
 
 “I happened by the other day when the animals were being 
fed,” Swan wrote. “Two puny, rickety, haggard youngsters 
were tugging at the hands of a beaten-looking man. No words 
passed. The children looked blankly at the food, and their 
father. Obviously there was no bread for them.”
 
✓ In Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in late 1933, a 15-year-old boy 
named Thomas Colbert was suffering from a chronic kidney 
disease. The illness had eaten the family’s savings, and Alec 
Colbert, Thomas’s father, had lost his job as a mechanic. The 
family had bought a small farm but lost it when they couldn’t 
pay the mortgage. According to a November 21 headline in the 
Indiana (Pennsylvania) Evening Gazette, Thomas “Did Not Want 
to Be Any Trouble to (His) Parents.” So he poisoned himself.

Scraping By at the Bottom 
of the Barrel
At just under 12 percent of the total population, minority groups 
were definitely in the minority in the United States of the Great 
Depression. The 1930 U.S. Census reported that 88.7 percent of the 
populace identified themselves as “white,” followed by 9.7 percent 
“Negro,” 1.2 percent “Mexican,” and 0.3 percent American Indian. 
(By contrast, the U.S. population was 33 percent minority in 2008.)
But despite being a relatively small slice of the American pie, 
minority groups bore an inordinate amount of the Great Depression’s 
burdens. What follows is a look at how the three largest minority 
groups fared during the 1930s.
African Americans
Most of the 11.9 million African Americans in the 1930s were 
already poor when the Great Depression began, so they didn’t feel 
the jolt as sharply as the white community. But because they were 
poorer to begin with, they did feel it more deeply.
 
About 80 percent of African Americans still lived in the South 
during the decade, and half of those lived in or near small towns 
in rural areas. Only 10 to 12 percent of those who farmed owned 
their own land. Most were tenant farmers (farming on rented land) 
or sharecroppers (growing crops on borrowed money, which was

repaid by giving up a percentage of the yield). And most were 
economically crippled even worse than they had been when the 
price of cotton dropped by more than half between 1929 and 1933.
Living conditions in the rural South ranged from bad to appalling. 
Fisk University sociologist Charles S. Johnson surveyed 916 black 
rural families in the mid-1930s. He reported that only 53 of the 
families had running water; 66 percent used “open privies,” or pit 
toilets, and 10 percent had no toilet at all. Only 2 percent had 
electricity.
Lynchings, which had dropped to a post–Civil War low of 8 in 1932, 
climbed to 28 in 1933, 15 in 1934, and 20 in 1935. And if lynching 
wasn’t uncommon, education for black children was: Some schools 
for African Americans opened only when the weather was bad and 
the students couldn’t work.
About 400,000 African Americans left the rural South for Northern 
cities during the 1930s, but things were only marginally better 
there:
 
✓ In New York City’s Harlem borough, the median annual 
income for black families in the mid-1930s was $1,300. In 
the white areas of the city, it was $1,750. Rents in Harlem, 
meanwhile, averaged $160 a year higher.
 
✓ In Cleveland, black families were twice as likely as white 
families to have annual incomes of less than $500 a year.
 
✓ In Chicago, African Americans made up just 4 percent of the 
city’s population but 16 percent of its unemployed.
Employers, many of whom had not been shy about having 
discriminatory hiring practices before the economic plunge, now 
were even less likely to hire a black person with so many unemployed 
white people from which to choose. By the end of 1932, black 
unemployment was estimated at 50 percent.
One small bright spot amid the hard times for African Americans 
was that some white retailers became more polite to black 
customers. “You know, this depression has made the great Anglo 
Saxon easier to get along with,” a black community leader wryly 
noted. “He smiles and is very friendly at his gas stations and stores.”
 
But federal relief programs under FDR’s administration were not 
always so friendly. Federal programs designed to help raise the 
price of cotton by paying landowners to plant fewer acres actually 
made things worse for black farm laborers or tenant farmers, 
because the landowners often pocketed all the subsidies while 
providing less work.

 Chapter 5: Coming Face to Face with Hard Times 79
Some of the federal job programs indirectly allowed African 
Americans to be paid less than white workers by setting lower 
wage levels for job classifications that were dominated by black 
workers.
Still, the fact that they were included in federal programs at all made 
many black voters leave the party of hero Abraham Lincoln — and 
more to the point, Herbert Hoover — and join the party of FDR. 
More black voters had backed Hoover than supported FDR in 1932. 
In Roosevelt’s reelection in 1936, however, 76 percent of African 
Americans voted for him.
 
The shift of African Americans from GOP allegiance to Democratic 
fealty continued through the rest of the 20th century and into the 
21st, and black voters became one of the Democratic Party’s most 
reliable voting blocs.
For his part, Roosevelt was very careful not to be seen as “pro-Negro,” 
to avoid irritating Southern members of Congress on whom he was 
counting to help push through his economic recovery program.
 
In explaining why he could not back an anti-lynching bill in 
1933, FDR told an executive of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People, “If I come out for the anti-lynching 
bill now, they (Southern members of Congress) will block every bill 
I ask Congress to pass to keep America from collapsing. I just can’t 
take that risk.”
What FDR couldn’t do because of politics, his wife Eleanor could 
because of her humanity. The First Lady was outspoken in her 
sympathies toward minorities and was roundly excoriated for it by 
racists around the country.
“We must all learn to work together, all of us, regardless of race 
or creed or color,” Eleanor said in a 1934 speech on African 
Americans and education. “We go ahead together or we go down 
together.”
Of course, then as now, not everyone felt the same way. U.S. 
Senator Theodore G. Bilbo of Mississippi, for example, actu-
ally proposed spending $1 billion in 1939 to deport all African 
Americans to the African country of Liberia.
But little by little, progress was made. In 1935, FDR issued an 
executive order specifically prohibiting discrimination on new 
federal public works projects. In 1937, he appointed the first 
black federal judge in U.S. history. And in 1939, the U.S. Justice 
Department created a Civil Rights section.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
80
America’s civil rights movement obviously had a long way to grow, 
but its roots may have taken hold during the Great Depression.
Latinos
The 1.4 million Latinos in the United States at the onset of 
the Great Depression shared some of the problems of African 
Americans — and had a few problems of their own.
 
The overwhelming majority of Latinos were from Mexico, which 
had been exempt from the U.S. immigration restrictions of the 
1920s, mainly because growers in the southwestern United States 
needed a source of cheap labor.
Many Latinos moved among the fields of Texas, Arizona, California, 
and southern Colorado, although some moved to cities such as 
Detroit and Chicago for manufacturing jobs. A Latino community in 
Los Angeles had reached a population of 100,000 by 1930. There, 
as elsewhere, Latinos were subject to strict segregation both in 
housing and in public settings such as movie theaters.
When the U.S. economy hit the skids in late 1929, the Latino labor 
supply became part of a labor glut, and Latinos became convenient 
scapegoats. Texas Representative Martin Dies proclaimed that “the 
large alien population is the basic cause of unemployment.”
A committee appointed by President Hoover recommended that 
the government toughen its immigration policies to reduce the 
labor supply, and in September 1930 Hoover agreed. The president 
invoked a provision in federal law that barred immigrants who 
were likely to become “burdens to taxpayers.” That move all but 
closed the United States to immigration.
The feds also began clamping down on immigrants who were 
deemed to be in the United States illegally. About 80,000 Latinos 
were eventually rounded up by the Federal Bureau of Immigration 
(which in 1933 became the Immigration and Naturalization Service) 
and deported.
Latino farm laborers, meanwhile, faced a double dilemma. As the 
Great Depression deepened, wages dropped. Pay in Colorado beet 
fields dropped from $27 an acre in 1929 to $12.37 in 1932. Picking 
100 pounds of cotton in Texas earned $1.28 in 1928; it earned 42 
cents in 1931. At the same time, local government relief programs 
and charitable aid began to be restricted to “citizens only,” which 
in most cases meant “whites only.”

 Chapter 5: Coming Face to Face with Hard Times 81
 
Although most federal relief programs under the Roosevelt 
administration were open to Latinos, the welcome mat had been 
all but pulled. In 1937, Congress closed a major federal jobs 
program to “aliens.” The ban extended to private companies with 
government contracts. Not wanting to take a chance at losing a 
contract, the companies often fired everyone that might fit the 
“alien” description, whether or not they were U.S. citizens.
Faced with mounting hostility, many Latinos decided to leave. In 
Los Angeles, county officials even offered to pay their train fares. 
An observer described the departure of one train loaded with 
repatriados, or repatriated Latinos: “The loading process began at 
six o’clock in the morning. Repatriados arrived by the truckload — 
men, women, children — with dogs, cats and goats; half-open 
suit cases, rolls of bedding and lunch baskets.” A punctilious 
official estimated the county saved $347,468.41 in relief aid for the 
$77,249.29 it spent on train fares.
Eventually, more than 300,000 Latinos, many of them U.S. citizens, 
left for Mexico. Some of those who stayed attempted to protect 
themselves by organizing their own unions, with mixed results. 
Those efforts are covered in Chapter 11.
Native Americans
In the mid-1880s, the federal government came up with the idea 
that the way to solve the country’s “Indian problem” was to 
“assimilate” them. That meant, among other things, allotting 
parcels of land to individual Native Americans, shipping Indian 
children off to white-run boarding schools to “help” them lose their 
culture, and waiting for the Indians to forget about being Indians.
To help them along, Congress made all Native Americans U.S. citizens 
in 1924, whether they wanted to be or not. (Some states didn’t 
want them to be; New Mexico and Arizona didn’t let Indians vote 
until 1948.)
In 1928, a Congress-commissioned study reported that the 
assimilation idea was a dismal failure:
 
✓ Half of Native Americans had lost the land that had been 
allotted to them, either by selling it or losing it for nonpayment 
of property taxes. By 1925, the 138 million acres given to 
individual Indians was down to 48 million.
 
✓ A shocking 96 percent of Native Americans had annual 
incomes of less than $200.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
82
 
✓ Infant mortality rates for Native Americans were twice the 
national average, and tuberculosis deaths were seven times 
the national average.
 
In 1934, the Roosevelt administration pushed a bill through 
Congress formally known as the Indian Reorganization Act (and 
informally known as the “Indian New Deal”). The act restored 
tribes’ rights to own land collectively, reaffirmed their right to 
self-government, and encouraged them to preserve their cultural 
identities and traditions while expanding their business and 
education opportunities.
In the dozen years after the act’s passage, tribes reclaimed a total 
of 4 million acres. But their overall economic lot did not improve, 
and when World War II began, the federal government lost interest 
in Native Americans again.
Lessons Learned
It took a descent into a swamp of joblessness, homelessness, 
and hunger in the Great Depression before a safety net of social 
services was woven that continues in place in the 21st century.
It also took the specter of economic disaster for women to break a 
longstanding tradition and enter the workplace.
Here’s a look at how the Great Depression helped spur the federal 
government to take an active role in aiding people in need, and 
how women have fared in the workplace since the 1930s.
Weaving a social services safety net
A host of 21st-century social service programs have their roots in 
actions taken by the federal government in response to the Great 
Depression. They include the following:
 
✓ Federal–State Unemployment Compensation: Created as part 
of the Social Security Act of 1935, the program is administered 
by individual states under federal guidelines. It’s financed by 
payroll taxes paid by employers. Almost anyone paid a salary 
or hourly wage is covered. Most states pay a maximum of 26 
weeks of benefits. An estimated 8 million people collected $35 
billion in benefits in the 2008 fiscal year.

 Chapter 5: Coming Face to Face with Hard Times 83
 
✓ Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF): Started in 
July 1997, this program is a successor to Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children (AFDC, 1960), which in turn was spawned 
by Aid to Dependent Children (ADC, 1935). The program is 
designed to give families up to 60 months of benefits, the 
levels of which vary from state to state. But it also requires 
recipients to work at least part-time. About 3.8 million families 
were participating in the program as of June 2008.
 
✓ Housing Choice Voucher Program: This program sprang 
from a 1937 law and is better known as “Section 8,” after the 
part of the law that dealt with the program. Under it, low-
income people pay a percentage (generally no more than 30 
percent) of their income for rent. The federal government 
pays the rest.
 
✓ Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Better known 
as the “food stamp” program, it provides assistance in buying 
food to low-income people. Until the late 1990s, recipients 
were issued booklets of coupons, or “stamps,” to exchange 
for food. The coupons were phased out in favor of electronic 
debit cards. The program, which served about 31.5 million 
people in fall 2008, is the latest iteration of a program that 
ran from 1939 to 1943. It was revived in 1961 and became a 
permanent program in 1964.
Virtually all of these programs have been criticized, often with 
justification, for faults ranging from arbitrary eligibility rules to 
insufficient benefit levels. None of them have totally solved the 
problems they’re designed to address. For example, the federal 
government estimated there were still 672,000 homeless people in 
the country in 2007, and that estimate is probably low.
But all in all, if you asked someone in a 1933 bread line, he’d almost 
certainly be glad to jump into a 21st-century social services safety 
net, holes and all.
Paying women what they’re worth
World War II tossed out the window many of the traditional 
arguments about women going to work. Millions of women took 
jobs left vacant by men in uniform. One thing that didn’t change, 
however, was the gender gap in wages: In 1944, women in war-
production factories received an average of $31.21 a week, while 
men working in the same jobs were paid $54.65.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
84
That gap remained relatively stable until the early 1960s, when 
Congress passed the Equal Pay Act, which made it illegal to pay 
men and women different wages for the same job. Between 1963 
and 2008, the gender wage gap closed from women making 60 
percent of what men received to 77 percent.
Even so, according to U.S. census numbers, the gap was still 
costing women from $400,000 to $2 million in lost wages over a 
lifetime. In 2009, several bills to strengthen and close loopholes in 
the 1963 law were pending in Congress.
In most recessions since World War II, women tended to lose their 
jobs at a lesser rate than men did. But in the recession that began 
in late 2007, the percentage of women becoming unemployed 
was actually higher than the percentage of men. Median wages 
for women also fell much farther (3 percent in 2007, compared 
to 0.5 percent for men), according to a report by the U.S. Senate 
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
Men or women still dominated certain jobs in the 2000s, just as 
they did in the 1930s. For example, 91 percent of registered nurses 
in 2007 were women, while 83 percent of industrial engineers were 
men. But gender barriers had come down in scores of occupations, 
and women filled jobs that few in the 1930s could have imagined 
them in, such as firefighter, airline pilot, and Secretary of State.

Troubles on the Farm
In This Chapter

I
f one group of Americans was well-rehearsed for the onset 
of the Great Depression in late 1929, it was the 29 million 
people who lived on farms. That’s because they had already been 
punched and pummeled by economic forces throughout the 1920s.
In this chapter, I show how the already-dreary situation for U.S. 
farmers got worse. I explain how some of them fought back and 
how the federal government came up with a plan to make farmers’ 
lives better by paying them for not growing so much stuff. 
The chapter ends with Mother Nature walloping farmers with 
drought, dust, and bugs. It wasn’t easy being a farmer in the Great 
Depression.
Farmers’ Pre-Depression 
Depression
Americans had a long tradition of idealizing farmers and farm life. 
Thomas Jefferson referred to them as “the chosen people of God.” 
The 19th-century orator and statesman Daniel Webster declared 
that farmers “are the foundation of civilization.” And Theodore 
Roosevelt insisted that “everything possible should be done to 
better the economic condition of the farmer.”

Part II: Getting Depressed  
86
While such statements may have made farmers feel warm and 
fuzzy, the truth was that farming had always been a very tough 
way to make a living. It was heavily dependent on the uncontrollable 
variables of both nature and how much people were willing to pay 
for what they ate and wore.
Getting a boost from 
weather and WWI
But by the second decade of the 20th century, the stars seemed to 
align themselves in favor of U.S. farmers. Rainfall was reliable, and 
the weather generally cooperated. The outbreak of World War I in 
1914 meant most European nations had to devote their attention 
and resources to fighting instead of farming. As a result, demand 
for U.S. exports of food and fiber soared.
The growth in demand came at the same time that technology was 
improving everything from irrigation systems to egg incubators. 
Particularly important were improvements in tractors that made 
them smaller and more maneuverable. The number of motorized 
farm vehicles tripled during and just after World War I.
The advent of tractors meant the demise of many horses and 
mules that had previously been used to supply power to farm 
machines. An estimated 9 million animals were destroyed in the 
decade following World War I, and 25 million acres that had been 
used to grow animal food were converted to grow people food.
The improved technology meant improved production, which, 
combined with higher prices, resulted in more profit. For example, 
in 1913 U.S. wheat farmers produced 751 million bushels on 52 
million acres for a price of 79 cents a bushel. In 1919, the year after 
the war’s end, wheat farmers produced 952 million bushels on 
73.7 million acres for $2.16 a bushel. Gross income for all U.S. farm 
products rose from $7.9 billion in 1913 to $18 billion in 1919.
And as demand grew and prices rose, many farmers began 
acquiring more land so they could make even more money. Farm 
mortgage debt rose from $3.4 billion in 1910 to $6.7 billion in 1920 
and more than $9 billion by 1925. It proved in most instances to be 
a classic case of overreaching.

 Chapter 6: Troubles on the Farm 87
Watching demand and prices fall
Two things happened to end the financial frolic on U.S. farms. The 
first was that World War I ended. Nations that had devoted most of 
their resources to the war began growing their own food and fibers 
again, reducing the demand for U.S. products.
 
The second was that farmers did precisely the wrong thing in the 
face of falling prices: They continued to overproduce, growing 
more crops and animals than there was a market for, either abroad 
or within the United States.
The result was that prices dropped precipitously. Wheat prices fell 
from a high of $2.16 a bushel in 1919 to 93 cents a bushel in 1923. 
Total farm income, which had reached $18 billion in 1919, was $6 
billion a decade later. In 1929, the average per capita income of all 
Americans was $750. For farmers, it was $273.
And then things really got bad. As the entire country slipped into 
economic quicksand at the end of 1929, and being able to afford 
food became an everyday struggle for millions of people, demand — 
and prices — slipped sharply down:
 
✓ Chicken farmers in Missouri earned as little as 3 cents a dozen 
for eggs. Dairy farmers in Nebraska sold milk for as little as 2 
cents a quart — when they could sell it at all.
 
✓ Corn was so cheap, an Iowa school district offered to trade a 
season ticket to high school basketball games for 600 pounds 
of ear corn, but only if the corn was delivered.
 
✓ In January 1933, an Iowa farmer reportedly sent five calves 
to the Chicago stockyards by rail. He got back a bill for $1.98: 
The sales price hadn’t covered the cost of shipping and feeding 
them.
Total U.S. farm income, which had been at a lofty $18 billion in 
1919, was $2 billion by 1932. Wheat prices, which had been $2.16 a 
bushel in 1919, dropped to 38 cents in 1932. The average per-acre 
value of farmland fell from $69.31 in 1920 to $29.68 in 1932. By the 
mid-1930s, only 16 percent of U.S. farm families were making more 
than $1,500 a year, which was the U.S. median family income. More 
than half of farm families were making less than $1,000 a year.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
88
 
“We plan to live on our small income of $1 a week, besides $3.60 
which we receive from the relief every week,” a South Dakota farm 
wife wrote a farming magazine in February 1935. She added ominously, 
“If these plans don’t work out, we won’t need to make any more 
plans.”
While prices and income dropped, however, mortgage payments 
and property taxes remained fixed. By 1933, 150,000 farms a year 
were being foreclosed, more than 17,000 a year in Iowa alone. By 
1934, federal officials estimated that 30 percent of the farms in the 
northern and central states were owned by “creditors or government 
agencies which have been compelled to take over the property.”
 
It wasn’t just a lack of income that made life difficult for families, 
but also a lack of basic services and amenities. More than 1,300 
rural counties had no general hospital. Nine of ten farm households 
had no indoor toilet, and eight of ten had no electricity. Hundreds 
of thousands of school-age children couldn’t go to school because 
they were needed to work on the farm, they lacked clothes or 
shoes, or there was simply no school in their area.
Farm families in the Midwest burned cow manure for fuel, made 
soup out of the thorny Russian thistle tumbleweed, and watched 
their animals starve. On a visit to the Dakotas in 1933, federal 
investigator Lorena Hickok reported the area had become “the 
Siberia of the United States.”
 
“A more hopeless place I never saw,” she wrote. “Half the people — 
the farmers particularly — are scared half to death . . . the rest of 
the people are apathetic.”
Sharecroppers: The worst 
of the worst-off
As bad as things were in the Midwest and Great Plains states, they 
were worse in the South. Drought conditions that plagued most 
U.S. farming regions at various times throughout the 1930s started 
in the South first, in 1930. That was just three years after devastating 
floods in the region had covered vast areas, wiping out entire crops.
 
In addition, the Southern farmer was much more likely than farmers 
elsewhere to be a tenant farmer or a sharecropper. About 75 percent 
of farmers outside the South owned the land they farmed. In the 
South, fewer than half did.
Tenant farmers ranked slightly above sharecroppers on the 
socio-economic pyramid. Tenant farmers were renters who often 
used their own equipment and kept the profits from their crops.

 Chapter 6: Troubles on the Farm 89
Sharecroppers were often virtual slaves, or at best medieval-style 
serfs. Landowners advanced money to the sharecroppers for seeds 
and supplies. The sharecroppers planted and reaped, then turned 
over a share of the crops to repay the debt, the rent on the land, 
and the use of equipment. Plus, landowners received a percentage 
of whatever amount was left. That left the sharecropper with not 
very much. A 1933 study of four Southern states found that the 
average annual income for working sharecroppers was $350 for 
white families and $294 for black families.
The sharecroppers’ living conditions were for the most part 
horrendous. A January 1933 story in The New York Times about 
sharecroppers in Arkansas described them as living off lard, flour, 
and salt pork given to them by the Red Cross. Their homes were 
“shacks built of logs” and “dilapidated board houses.”
 
“They have little furniture,” the story related, “perhaps a bed, two 
or three chairs and a stove in one room, and a rickety table and 
stove in the kitchen. Many are less fortunate than this . . . a lawyer 
at Harrisburg told of visiting one family of five where all were living 
in one room, sleeping on the floor and with a fireplace of mud.”
After touring some Southern states in 1934, Secretary of Agriculture 
Henry Wallace declared that “one third of the farmers of the United 
States live under conditions which are so much worse than the 
peasantry of Europe that the city people of the United States should 
be thoroughly embarrassed.”
Fumbling federal efforts to help
A few efforts were made at the federal level in the 1920s to help 
the beleaguered farmer, none of them successful. Congress twice 
passed bills that would have authorized the federal government to 
buy excess crops at prices that reasonably reflected the farmers’ 
cost of production, and then either store the crops until market 
prices rose or sell them to other countries for whatever they 
would pay. But President Calvin Coolidge vetoed both bills on the 
grounds that it was too expensive and that government should 
stay out of the market.
When Herbert Hoover succeeded Coolidge as president in 1929, 
one of his first efforts was to try to convince farmers to form 
cooperatives where they could coordinate crop production with 
each other. He also pushed a bill through Congress that created 
the Federal Farm Board, which was authorized to buy surplus 
crops and store them. But the cooperative thing never got going, 
and the Farm Board rather quickly ran out of money and storage 
space before it had much of an impact.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
90
 
Farmers, meanwhile, were fed up with the Feds. At a January 1933 
hearing of the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Agriculture, the president 
of the Wisconsin Farmers’ Union told senators, “I almost hate to 
express it, but I honestly believe that if some of them (farmers) 
could buy airplanes, they would come down here to Washington 
and blow you fellows up.”
John Simpson, the president of the National Farmers Union, 
echoed the sentiment. “The biggest and finest crop of revolutions 
you ever saw is sprouting all over the country right now,” he 
warned.
Fighting-Mad Farmers
As early as 1927, farmers in the Missouri River Valley in western 
Iowa and eastern Nebraska had talked about a strike. Following 
the veto by President Calvin Coolidge of a bill that would have 
had the federal government buy surplus crops, a group of farmers 
calling themselves the Corn Belt Committee drafted a resolution 
that stated in part, “if we cannot obtain justice by legislation, the 
time will have arrived when no other course remains than organized 
refusal to deliver the production of the farms at less than production 
costs.”
What the committee wanted was “parity,” which they defined as 
crop and livestock prices that covered the cost of production and 
transportation, plus a “reasonable” profit of 5.25 percent. But the 
architects of the idea received little support for the idea of a 
farmers’ strike until 1932.
By then, the gap between “parity” prices and real-world prices was 
enormous. The parity price of corn was estimated at 92 cents a 
bushel; of hogs, $11.25; and of butterfat, 62 cents a pound. The real 
prices were 32 cents a bushel for corn, $3.85 for hogs, and 18 cents 
for a pound of butterfat. Meanwhile, the number of farms being 
foreclosed because farmers could not pay their mortgages or taxes 
was rising weekly.
Calling for a “holiday”
In May 1932, about 1,300 farmers met in Des Moines, Iowa, and 
formed the Farmers’ Holiday Association. The “Holiday” part was 
borrowed from a practice banks used to avoid mass withdrawals: 
When a run on the bank began, the banker would declare a 
“holiday” and simply keep the doors locked until things cooled off.

 Chapter 6: Troubles on the Farm 91
What the farmers proposed to do was simple: refuse to deliver 
their crops and animals to market until they received fixed and fair 
prices, and prevent anyone else from delivering their products.
 
“Concede to the farmer production costs,” the group’s leader, 
Milo Reno, said in a radio address, “and he will pay his grocer, 
the grocer will pay the wholesaler, the wholesaler will pay the 
manufacturer, and the manufacturer will be able to meet his 
obligations at the bank. Restore the farmers’ purchasing power, 
and you have re-established an endless chain of prosperity and 
happiness in the country.”
 
The chances of a farmers’ strike succeeding were pretty much zero 
from the start. For one thing, they were badly organized and never 
attracted a large enough following to have a major impact. Many 
farmers simply could not afford to withhold their crops, even if the 
prices they were paid were miniscule. Families and livestock had 
to be fed. In addition, many farmers were suspicious of anything 
that smacked of communism (and indeed, communists did try to 
gain a foothold in the association).
It was also extremely difficult to actually block all the possible 
ways to get to all the markets that existed. But that didn’t stop the 
group from trying.
Facing the farmers in the road
The striking farmers used spiked logs and cables to block roads 
into towns that had agricultural markets. Cars were allowed to 
proceed; trucks with produce, grain, livestock, or dairy products 
were turned away, sometimes with a bit of force applied by club-
wielding farmers. Local police, who were badly outnumbered (and 
sometimes sympathetic to the cause), couldn’t do much, and so 
the strikers got bolder.
Lawyers for mortgage-holding companies were kidnapped, bankers 
bullied, and aggressive lawmen disarmed. After several strikers in 
Council Bluffs, Iowa, were arrested, a mob of 1,000 men marched 
into town and freed them. In Wisconsin, two cheese factories were 
bombed, and scores more closed temporarily in fear.
In late April 1933 in Le Mars, Iowa, a district court judge named 
Charles C. Bradley was dragged from his courthouse by a mob of 
600 farmers. The judge was roughed up, and a rope was put around 
his neck. After he refused to promise to stop hearing foreclosure 
cases, the mob clapped a grease-filled hubcap on his head, 
removed his pants, and left him standing in the middle of the road.

The strikers even had a song: “Let’s call a farmer’s holiday/A 
holiday let’s hold/We’ll eat our wheat and ham and eggs/And let 
them eat their gold.”
They also had a rationalization for their actions, which was that 
they were following American tradition. “They say blockading 
the road’s illegal,” a striker told a reporter for Harper’s Magazine. 
“I says ‘seems to me there was a tea party in Boston that was 
illegal too.’”
Holding “penny” auctions
The striking farmers had another tactic that was actually more 
effective than the roadblocks, at least in terms of actual results: 
They would sabotage foreclosure auctions. Sometimes doing so 
involved forcibly blocking the sheriff and auctioneer from starting 
the auction at all, and sometimes it meant bullying the mortgage 
holder into rethinking the foreclosure.
At one Iowa auction, farmers pushed their way through a police 
line, forced the mortgagor to forget about foreclosing, and then 
made the mortgagor and each of the cops kneel and kiss the 
American flag.
In slightly more subtle cases, the Holiday farmers would conduct 
“penny” auctions. Someone would bid a penny or other small 
amount for a piece of farm equipment being auctioned, and it was 
made clear that no one else was welcome to bid. After everything 
had been sold, the mortgage holder was prodded into accepting 
whatever pittance had been raised and relinquishing the deed, 
which was then turned over to the farm’s owner.
For example, at an October 1932 foreclosure sale of a Nebraska 
widow’s farm, 2,500 of her “neighbors” showed up. Her cows sold 
for 35 cents each, her disc plow for 25 cents, and her six horses 
for a total of $5.60. When it was over, everything had been sold for 
a bit over $100. The banker grudgingly turned over the $442 
mortgage for the $100, and the widow was given back the farm 
and all its assets.
Catching Washington’s attention
Just as the roadblocks failed to raise crop prices, the penny auctions 
didn’t in themselves make a significant dent in foreclosure sales. 
But both kinds of actions did make a significant impression on the 
region’s politicians and got the attention of people in Washington, D.C.

 Chapter 6: Troubles on the Farm 93
North Dakota Governor William “Wild Bill” Langer advised farmers 
during his 1932 election campaign to “shoot the banker if he comes 
on your farm. Treat him like a chicken thief.” (Langer later imposed 
a short-lived embargo on North Dakota wheat, prohibiting wheat 
from being shipped out of the state until prices rose.) Iowa legislators 
passed a law in February 1933 that put a foreclosure moratorium 
on all mortgages that were not yet delinquent. Eight other states 
followed with similar laws.
 
The Holiday group also got the attention of the national media. 
In The New Republic in August 1932, journalist Donald R. Murphy 
wrote that the strike was “a significant symptom of the state of 
mind of a great conservative class which has borne depression for 
twelve years and which is finally ready to employ radical measures 
that seem to give it a chance to save itself from general bankruptcy.”
After the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in November 1932, the 
striking farmers took a wait-and-see stance and halted most of 
their road blocking and auction hijacking. Roosevelt and Congress 
quickly pushed through several bills designed to provide relief to 
farmers (covered in this chapter’s next section).
Milo Reno
Depending on your point of view, Milo Reno was either a charismatic prophet or a 
demagogic rabble-rouser. Either way, he kept things lively in America’s farm coun-
try during the Great Depression.
Reno was born in Iowa in 1866, the 12th of 13 children of a farm family. Pushed by 
his mother, he attended college in Iowa, where he studied theology. After a career 
as a farmer and part-time preacher, Reno joined the newly formed Iowa Farmers’ 
Union in 1918. Within three years, he was union president and also ran two of the 
union’s three insurance companies.
As founder, president, and chief instigator of the Farmers’ Holiday Association, 
Reno was a tireless orator and organizer. Tall and thin-lipped, with a shock of bushy 
hair and a fondness for oversized cowboy hats, Reno became something of a media 
darling for several years during the 1930s. Time magazine described him as both 
“indefatigable” and “a bad weather bird” who showed up wherever there was 
dissension.
But as the Roosevelt administration’s farm relief efforts took hold, Reno’s fiery rhet-
oric became less interesting. He became a staunch FDR-hater and began champi-
oning the formation of a third major political party in time for the 1936 presidential 
race. Like the farmers’ strike, the third-party idea failed to catch on. Reno died of a 
heart attack in 1936 at the age of 70.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
94
The federal government’s efforts weren’t enough for some of the 
Holiday Association, including its president, Milo Reno. Reno 
wanted the government to guarantee set prices for farm products 
and set no limits on how much farmers could produce. “We were 
promised a new deal by which agriculture would receive the same 
consideration as others,” Reno complained. “Instead, we have the 
same old stacked deck.”
But others thought the Roosevelt plan was a fair start. “We don’t 
care if Milo Reno does say that you shouldn’t touch any of that 
(federal) money,” the Le Mars (Iowa) Sentinel editorialized. “When 
you get a chance to get Uncle Sam’s check for anywhere from $300 
to $1,000 and even more, there’s something wrong with you if you 
don’t take it.”
By the end of 1933, the farmers’ strike was all but over. But it had 
served to shine the national spotlight on the plight of American 
farmers, and helped spur efforts to ease their burdens.
Paying Farmers Not to Farm
Within weeks of taking office in March 1933, President Roosevelt 
began pushing for a program to aid farmers. In May, FDR signed 
the Emergency Farm Mortgage Act, which provided $200 million 
for refinancing mortgages for farmers facing foreclosure.
 
He also signed the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), which 
created the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, as well 
as doing some pretty interesting adjusting to U.S. agriculture. 
Previous efforts to deal with farm overproduction had centered 
on taking farm product surpluses off the market and storing them. 
Roosevelt favored a different approach: not growing or raising the 
surplus products in the first place.
 
That’s exactly what the AAA did. Farmers who agreed to plant at 
least one-third fewer acres or raise at least one-third fewer animals 
were paid by the federal government for the ungrown or unraised 
products. The price was set at or near prices for the products that 
were actually grown or raised. Money to fund the program was 
raised by imposing a tax on food processors, which in turn slightly 
raised consumer prices. Other AAA elements came to include price 
supports for rice, fruit, peanuts, and milk. Another $2 billion was 
set aside for providing mortgage aid to farmers looking to refinance 
their loans.

 Chapter 6: Troubles on the Farm 95
A program run through the federal Commodity Credit Corporation 
further supplemented the act. The program allowed farmers to 
obtain loans from the federal government in return for agreeing to 
store part of their crops. If market prices rose, the farmer could 
reclaim his crops, sell them, and repay the loan. If prices didn’t 
rise, the farmer could keep the loan and the Feds would keep the 
crop. By 1940, the federal government was storing more than $500 
million worth of unwanted cotton, wheat, and corn.
Pumping money into the economy
In addition, the AAA authorized as much as $3 billion in new currency 
to be added to the U.S. monetary system. The idea was to “reflate” 
the economy because the more money there is in the system, 
the easier it generally is to get some of it. Prices can therefore 
be raised without putting goods and services out of the reach of 
consumers. By raising prices, farmers could more easily pay their 
mortgages and taxes, countering the deflation (drop in prices and 
consumption) that had plagued them for years.
An example: Farmer Jones got $2.19 a bushel for his wheat in 1919 
and had mortgage payments of $50 a month. In 1932, wheat fell to 
38 cents a bushel but the mortgage was still $50 a month. But with 
more money in the system, wheat prices rose to 69 cents in 1934, 
while the mortgage stayed at $50.
The act was certainly ambitious enough to draw plenty of criticism. 
Food processors hated it because of the tax it imposed on them. 
Mortgage lenders and people with lots of money hated the idea of 
more money being pumped into the economy because it meant the 
money they already had was less rare and, therefore, worth less.
 
Even some farmers were skeptical. “The way I figure it, we’ve got 
to pay this money back some day,” an Iowa farmer told a touring 
reporter from the Syracuse (New York) Herald about a year after 
the act was in place. “The money I got for hogs and corn I didn’t 
have to raise was a life-saver . . . but there is no reason to it I can 
see. The agents tell me I do not understand economics. Well, 
maybe I don’t, but I wonder if they understand farming.”
But like many of FDR’s programs, most people were willing to give 
it a try and see if it would help the farmer. BusinessWeek magazine 
editorialized, “It might seem important to us to preserve in our 
country the one large class of property owners, the greatest body 
of entrepreneurs, the one stable and rooted element. It might seem 
worth a high cost — and it might be cheaper than to add them 
(farmers) to the breadlines of the cities.”

Finding a glitch and 
a flaw in the AAA
The Agricultural Adjustment Act contained both a politically 
embarrassing glitch and a cruelly devastating flaw.
“[T]he slaughter of innocents”
The glitch was that FDR didn’t get the bill from Congress and sign 
it until May 12, 1933. That turned out to be well after Southern 
farmers had planted their cotton crops and the spring litters of 
hogs had been born in the Midwest.
 
To reduce surpluses right away and get money to the farmers 
quickly, the farmers were persuaded to plow up 10 million acres 
of cotton and destroy 200,000 sows and 6 million piglets. All that 
potential clothing material and pork chops going to waste was a bit 
much to swallow for millions of hungry and ill-clothed Americans.
The noted defense and civil rights attorney Clarence Darrow 
proclaimed it a crime to “kill little pigs and throw them out on the 
prairies to decay while millions are hungry.” Newspaper columnists 
labeled it “the slaughter of the innocents.” Even Secretary of 
Agriculture Henry Wallace acknowledged it was “a shocking 
commentary on our civilization.”
By October, an embarrassed government formed the Federal 
Surplus Relief Corporation, which diverted excess farm products 
to state and local relief agencies. Harder to fix, however, was the 
plight of the tenant farmer and sharecropper because of the AAA.
The greedy stiff the needy
The flaw was in the way the Agricultural Adjustment Act dealt with 
tenant farmers and sharecroppers, the farmers who most needed 
help. Because subsidies from the AAA were based on the amount 
of land a farmer owned, farmers who rented their land were left 
out in the cold. The act did call for landowners to share their 
federal loot with their tenant farmers and sharecroppers, but it 
relied on the landowner to pass on the money, and very few did.
Instead, many landowners either withdrew rental farmland from 
production or used the federal money to buy tractors and hire 
day laborers to work the fields. Either way, the tenant farmers and 
sharecroppers and their families were often out on their ears.

 Chapter 6: Troubles on the Farm 97
 
They found themselves with no place to go. Some tenant farmers 
(both white and black) in Arkansas organized a union in 1933 to 
try to get a share of the federal money. Beatings and whippings 
by goons hired by landowners ended that effort. Congress passed 
two bills, one to resettle displaced tenant farmers and the other to 
help them buy land. Neither worked very well. And the Roosevelt 
administration was hesitant to fix the problem for fear it would 
alienate Southern members of Congress whose votes were needed 
for New Deal programs to gain approval.
The result was that tens of thousands of the poorest farmers 
took to the road, many heading for the promise of a paradise in 
California. Whether that effort worked out for them is covered in 
Chapter 8.
Revamping the AAA
Coupled with a severe and persistent drought that decimated 
crops (which I cover in the next section) and reduced supplies, the 
Agricultural Adjustment Act did help raise farm prices and farm 
income. Wheat rose from 32 cents a bushel in 1932 to 69 cents in 
1934, 92 cents in 1936, and $1.24 in 1937. Cotton, which had sold 
for about 6 cents a pound in 1932, averaged between 10 cents and 
13 cents in the next four years. Gross farm income rose 50 percent 
between 1933 and 1936.
In 1936, however, the U.S. Supreme Court declared the act 
unconstitutional on the grounds that “Congress has no power to 
enforce its command on the farmer to the ends sought by” the act, 
and that the processing tax it contained was also illegal.
 
Roosevelt quickly countered the court’s decision with the Soil 
Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, which paid farmers to 
conserve soil by following the natural contours of the land (contour 
farming) rather than straight rows. It also provided funds for 
planting beans, clove, and other crops that renewed the soil. This 
time, the money came from the federal government’s general 
operating budget and not a specific tax.
In 1937, another bill was approved that allowed the Secretary of 
Agriculture to set acreage limits for staple crops in order to stem 
surpluses. It had limited success, and farm surpluses continued 
until World War II came along.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
98
 
Throughout the rest of the Great Depression, the Roosevelt 
administration continued to tinker with farm legislation. “(It) is in 
the nature of an experiment,” Roosevelt told reporters. “We all 
recognize that. My position toward farm legislation is that we 
ought to do something to increase the value of farm products, and 
if the darn thing doesn’t work, we can say so quite frankly, but at 
least try it.”
Drought and Dust
On April 15, 1935, newspapers around the country carried a story 
written by Associated Press reporter Robert Geiger from a town 
called Guymon, Oklahoma.
 
It began: “Three little words — achingly familiar on a Western 
farmer’s tongue — rule life today in the dust bowl of the continent: 
‘If it rains.’ Ask any farmer, any merchant, any banker, and you 
hear them: ‘If it rains.’”
Geiger used the term “dust bowl” to describe a specific geographic 
region: the western third of Kansas, southeastern Colorado, the 
Oklahoma panhandle, the northeastern two-thirds of the Texas 
panhandle, and northeastern New Mexico. But the phrase caught 
on. It was capitalized for emphasis and became the catchall term 
for what was the worst environmental and agricultural disaster in 
U.S. history.
The disaster began with the plow and the high price of wheat. For 
centuries, the Great Plains had been covered with hardy buffalo 
grass. The region had a semi-arid climate but was suitable for 
grazing animals. In the last part of the 19th century and first part of 
the 20th, however, people began ripping up the buffalo grass and 
replacing it with wheat.
 
In good years, with plenty of rain, the result was bumper crops. 
But in 1930, the rain stopped coming to much of the country’s 
midsection. The next year saw a return to near normalcy, but in 
1932 precipitation dropped precipitously. By 1934, the drought 
had spread to cover 75 percent of the country. At least 27 states 
were severely affected.
Peaks at the southern end of the Rocky Mountains received no 
snow in the winter of 1933–34. In parts of the Midwest, the top 
three feet of earth contained no detectable moisture. Between June 
1933 and May 1934, almost no rain at all fell on the southern Great 
Plains.

 Chapter 6: Troubles on the Farm 99
The drought — which lasted in some areas through 1936 — was 
accompanied by blistering heat in the summers. On July 24, 1933, 
temperatures reached 117 degrees in Vinita, Oklahoma; 109 in 
Omaha, Nebraska; and 112 in Independence, Kansas. In 1936, parts 
of western Kansas had 60 straight days of temperatures of 100 
degrees or more.
Roosevelt, the rainmaker
In August 1934, President Roosevelt toured drought-stricken areas 
of Minnesota and North Dakota. “It is a problem,” Roosevelt 
understated to a crowd in Devils Lake, North Dakota. “I would not 
try to fool you by saying we know the solution of it . . . when I came 
out on the (train) platform this morning, I saw a rather dark cloud. 
I said to myself ‘maybe it is going to rain.’ Well it didn’t. All I can 
say is, I hope to goodness it is going to rain, good and plenty.”
And it did rain, although not “good and plenty.” After the presidential 
train left, The New York Times reported, “the rain cut a path about 
100 miles wide . . . with the heaviest fall in the cities the presidential 
train visited. In each case the showers came about seven hours 
after the (president) had departed.”
But even Roosevelt couldn’t be everywhere at once. Some 
communities in Kansas listened to pitches from salesmen with 
machines that could make it rain — they said. But, The New York 
Times reported, “thirty years ago, Kansas invested in rain-making 
machines which failed, and they are skittish of the new apparatuses.”
In Mitchell, South Dakota, people turned to prayer. At 11 a.m. on 
July 10, 1936, with the temperature hovering at 104 degrees (the 
eighth straight day over 100), the town’s 13 church towers began 
tolling their bells. Eleven thousand people fell to their knees and 
prayed for rain. It didn’t work.
A plague of grasshoppers
One creature — make that billions of creatures — that loved the 
heat and aridity were grasshoppers. Encouraged to breed often by 
the dry conditions, grasshoppers proliferated across the northern 
Great Plains during the early and mid-1930s. In 1933, entomologists 
estimated grasshopper infestations covered 75 percent of South 
Dakota, with the insects laying as many as 5,000 to 10,000 eggs per 
square foot in some areas.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
100
 
“The sun was shining brightly when we left home,” a South Dakota 
woman wrote in 1933. “When we were about halfway, it just turned 
dark. It was grasshoppers, blocking the sun.”
They came in such massive numbers that they stacked up four 
inches deep in streets, making cars skid as if they were on ice. It 
was reported that trains sometimes could not get traction on the 
track rails because they were covered with grasshoppers.
And they ate virtually everything: grain, vegetables, clothes left 
hanging out to dry, even the corks out of water jugs. A Nebraska 
woman in 1936 reported that her 5-year-old daughter left a doll 
outside, and the grasshoppers ate it.
To cope, farmers tried mixing bran, molasses, and arsenic and 
spreading it on the edges of fields. The grasshoppers ate it with 
enthusiasm, even consuming the abdomens of their poisoned 
comrades. The Aberdeen (South Dakota) News suggested farmers 
employ ring-necked pheasants, which were regarded by many 
farmers as a grain-eating pest in their own right, to gobble the 
grasshoppers. “Pheasants will utterly ignore grains as long as there 
is an abundance of insects,” the paper advised.
Neither the poison nor the birds put much of a dent in the hordes 
of ’hoppers. It would take a return to more normal weather 
conditions to do that, and there wasn’t much farmers could do 
about the weather.
Mountains of dust
On May 11, 1934, the captain of a German liner reported that the 
ship was late reaching port in New York City because of “a peculiar 
atmospheric cloudiness” it encountered while off the East Coast of 
the United States.
 
What the ship had run into was the middle of the United States, or 
at least part of it, in the form of dust. The dust — an estimated 300 
million tons of it — had been picked up by strong northwest winds 
from the parched Great Plains and swept across the Mississippi 
River. It stretched from St. Paul, Minnesota, in the north to 
Nashville, Tennessee, in the south, reached heights of 15,000 feet, 
and was still so thick when it reached New York that pedestrians 
could not see the tops of the city’s skyscrapers.
“The explanation of the dust cloud is simple,” U.S. Weather Service 
meteorologist James H. Kimball told The New York Times. “The 
surface soil in the Upper Missouri and Mississippi valleys was fine 
and loose as a result of the drought. All that was needed was a 
persistent and direct wind.”

 Chapter 6: Troubles on the Farm 101
From 1934 to 1938, big and small dust storms swirled through 
and out of the nation’s midsection. They occurred most often in 
summer, although “brown snow storms” were not unheard of in 
winter. And while persistent, the winds were not always predictable.
 
“If the wind blew one way, here came the dark dust from Oklahoma,” 
a Texas farmer contended in 1934. “Another way, and it was the gray 
dust from Kansas. Still another way, the brown dust from Colorado 
and New Mexico.”
The statistics generated by the dust storms were stunning:
 
✓ Federal officials reported in late 1934 that the storms had 
wreaked havoc across 1,400 counties in 22 states.
 
✓ The 1934 Yearbook on Agriculture calculated that 225 million 
acres of farmland had either lost their topsoil or were in the 
process of losing it.
 
✓ The Department of Agriculture estimated that 19 million bushels 
of wheat were lost in one week to a dust storm in mid-1934.
Photographs of the storms, such as in Figure 6-1, inspired awe and 
dread in those who had never seen a dust storm in person. For 
those who encountered them all too frequently, it was an experience 
that was simultaneously familiar and terrifying.

about a half hour.

A South Dakota observer described a 1933 storm this way: “By 
noon it was blacker than night, because one can see through night, 
and this was an opaque black. It was a wall of dust one’s eyes 
could not penetrate, but it could penetrate the eyes, ears and nose. 
It could penetrate to the lungs until one coughed up black.”
The dust was a killer. A 6-year-old boy walking home from school 
near Hays, Kansas, got lost in a dust storm, became tangled in a 
barbed wire fence, and suffocated. Six people died in a Colorado 
storm that lasted nearly a week. Infant mortality rates were sharply 
higher in Dust Bowl states.
Life’s little chores became teeth-grinding labor. Dishes had to be 
washed before meals to get the dust off. Liquids had to be stored 
in jars, and holes punched in the lids for straws, to keep the dust 
out. Meat was fried at the highest temperatures possible so that 
hot air rising from it would keep the dust from settling.
 
“Wearing our shade hats, with handkerchiefs tied over our faces 
and Vaseline in our nostrils, we have been trying to rescue our 
home from the accumulations of wind-blown dust which penetrates 
wherever air can go,” an Oklahoma woman wrote a friend in June 
1935. “It is an almost hopeless task, for there is rarely a day when 
the dust clouds do not roll over.”
Federal government efforts to help were substantial. In 1934, 
Roosevelt signed a bill that authorized him to establish grazing 
rights over 140 million acres of federal land, with oversight by 
the Department of Interior to ensure the land wasn’t overgrazed. 
The government spent $85 million between 1934 and 1936 to buy 
ruined farmland and try to rehabilitate it. It also bought cattle in 
drought areas, destroyed those that were in such bad shape they 
couldn’t be eaten, and distributed the meat from the rest to needy 
families.
 
And in 1935, Congress established the Soil Conservation Service 
(SCS) to teach and promote farming methods that preserved 
topsoil. The SCS encouraged farmers to form conservation districts 
to oversee soil conservation practices among themselves. Many of 
the districts continued to operate into the 21st century.
Combined, the programs resulted in an estimated 65 percent 
reduction in the amount of soil being blown by the winds. And in 
1939, the rains came back.

 Chapter 6: Troubles on the Farm 103
Lessons Learned
The Great Depression radically changed the relationship between 
the American farmer and the federal government. Here’s a look 
at how government has redefined its role in agriculture since the 
1930s, and how it handles surplus food and the poor.
The farmer and the Feds
Prior to the 1930s, the federal government rarely intervened in 
the agricultural economy. But since passage of the Agricultural 
Adjustment Act (AAA) in 1933, there have been at least a dozen 
major bills approved by Congress and signed by the president that 
deal with providing some form of financial aid to farmers.
Until the mid-1960s, major farm legislation was similar to 1933’s 
AAA. The bills committed the federal government to guaranteeing 
prices on farm products and paid farmers not to plant or raise 
more than the market could buy. But in 1965, Congress began 
providing some direct income support to farmers that wasn’t tied 
directly to how much they did or didn’t grow. The idea was that 
surplus products could be sold to expanding markets in other 
countries. In 1977, “farm bills” began to include non-farm elements, 
such as nutrition assistance programs like food stamps.
 
In 1996, the “Freedom to Farm” bill cut any remaining ties between 
federal payments to farmers and surplus production. One result 
was that surplus U.S. farm products began to swamp some world 
markets, undercutting farmers in other countries.
Laughing away the Dust Bowl blues
To keep their spirits up, Dust Bowl residents tried to top each other with tall tales 
and tongue-in-cheek observations about the dust storms. “My uncle should be 
along soon,” went one line, “because I just saw his farm go by.” There was the 
story of the pilot who had to bail out over Amarillo: “It took him six hours to shovel 
his way back to earth.” Or the fellow who was hit by a drop of water and fainted: 
“It took two buckets of dust to revive him.” And then there was the Kansas woman 
who, when asked by a reporter how bad the latest storm had been, replied “Lady 
Godiva could have ridden through it without even her horse seeing her.”

Part II: Getting Depressed  
104
In 2008, Congress passed a $300 billion farm package, overriding 
the veto of President George W. Bush. The 673-page bill included 
$200 billion for nutritional assistance programs, $43 billion for 
subsidies to farmers, $30 billion for crop insurance programs, and 
$27 billion for conservation efforts.
While only about 25 percent of U.S. farms received subsidies in 
2008, the program has been routinely criticized over the years for 
doling out taxpayer money to rich “farmers” that include foreign 
corporations and farm owners who rarely set foot on their farms. 
The 2008 bill, for example, “limited” subsidies to those who made 
less than $750,000 a year in farm income and less than $500,000 a 
year in non-farm income.
The definition of “farm relief” has come a long way since the Great 
Depression.
Feeding the poor
In 1933, the federal government suffered a public relations black 
eye when it convinced farmers to destroy 6 million piglets and 
10 million acres of cotton to reduce surpluses. So the Roosevelt 
administration set up the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation, 
which eventually became the Federal Surplus Commodity 
Corporation, which eventually became the Surplus Marketing 
Administration, which eventually became the Emergency Food 
Assistance Program run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
What’s new on the farm?
When people talk about the “disappearing American farmer,” they’re not kidding. 
Consider this:
 ✓ Fewer farm families: About 24 percent of the U.S. population lived on farms in 
1930. The number was 2 percent in 2008. The number of farms during that same 
period dropped from 6.8 million to 2.1 million.
 ✓ Fewer farm workers: About 21.5 percent of working Americans made their 
living on farms in 1930, producing 7.7 percent of the country’s gross domestic 
product (GDP). In 2000, only 1.9 percent of the U.S. workforce worked on farms, 
producing 0.7 percent of the GDP.
 ✓ Less reliance on farm income: In 1930, about 30 percent of farm families had 
income from work off the farm. In 2002, 93 percent had off-farm income.

 Chapter 6: Troubles on the Farm 105
Whatever it was called, the program’s purpose was to take surplus 
farm products the government had bought from farmers and give 
them to people in need — through food banks, soup kitchens, and 
other distribution centers.
 
The system works okay when U.S. farmers have a surplus of com-
modities to sell. But when farmers have domestic and foreign mar-
kets for everything they produce, there is no surplus. In 2003, for 
example, the Feds provided $242 million in surplus commodities; 
in 2007 it was only $59 million.
In 2009, the program was expected to supply $92.6 million in sur-
plus commodities. An additional $250 million for food assistance 
was included in the 2008 farm bill, along with a program that sup-
plies monthly food boxes to needy Americans.

T
he United States didn’t have a monopoly on suffering during 
the Great Depression. In fact, very few countries escaped hard 
times.
This chapter begins with an explanation of how post–World War I 
desires for revenge and debt repayment played important roles 
in bringing about the Great Depression, as well as what role the 
gold standard had in the whole mess. I then offer some snapshots 
of how various countries and continents fared during the period. 
Finally, I look at how the Great Depression was handled in countries 
run by some of history’s nastiest people.
Tallying the Costs of War
In his memoirs, published in 1952, Herbert Hoover made it clear 
where he placed the blame for the calamitous gyrations of the 
world’s economy in the 1920s and 1930s. In fact, blame was 
assigned in the very first sentence: “The primary cause of the 
Great Depression was the war of 1914–1918.”
Hoover overstated World War I’s impact as a cause of the Great 
Depression and understated the role that the United States — and 
its presidents — played in creating the mess. But he did have a point 
in that the war certainly changed America’s role on the world stage.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
108
For one thing, the war shifted the center of the world’s economic 
system from Great Britain to the United States, which had become 
“the world’s banker.” The United States had loaned billions to the 
winning side during the war. After the war, it loaned billions more 
to the losing side, as well as continuing to funnel money to its 
wartime allies.
The United States was also the world’s manufacturing leader. 
Improvements in technology and manufacturing techniques in 
the United States after the war resulted in American workers 
producing goods at twice the rate of their European counterparts. 
That made U.S. goods cheaper, which made them more sought 
after by the rest of the world, which hurt European manufacturing.
So when the U.S. economy sagged badly at the end of 1929, the rest 
of the world felt its pain. Or as the noted British economist John 
Maynard Keynes put it at the time: “When America sneezes, the 
world catches cold.”
Paying reparations — or not
In addition to being a nightmarish waste of human life, World War I 
carried a hefty price tag: an estimated total of $186 billion. (That’s 
about $2.7 trillion in 2008 dollars.) The United States, which didn’t 
even get into the fighting until 1917, spent $22.6 billion, much of it 
in the form of loans to allied countries. Great Britain incurred $35.3 
billion of the war’s expense. Germany spent $37.7 billion — and 
wasn’t done paying, even after the war ended.
 
Article 231 of the war-settling Treaty of Versailles declared flatly 
that Germany was responsible for “all the loss and damage” suffered 
by the countries that fought against it. Germany agreed — extremely 
grudgingly — to make a staggering $33 billion in reparations 
(payment of damages) to its former foes. France was to get 52 
percent, Great Britain 22 percent, Italy 10 percent, Belgium 8 
percent, and smaller countries the rest.
That was a hefty hunk of change to demand from a country whose 
economy had been eviscerated. Germany had lost 90 percent of 
its merchant fleet and 75 percent of its iron ore production. The 
democratically elected government put in place by Germans after 
the war responded to the pressure by printing money like it was, 
well, paper. The result was not just inflation, but super mega 
hyperinflation. In 1923 it took 1 trillion German marks to buy what 
one mark could buy in 1914. People literally used wheelbarrows to 
carry their money.

 Chapter 7: Misery Loves Company: How the Rest of the World Fared 109
The United States, meanwhile, had a difference of opinion with its 
recent allies about the whole reparations idea. Three consecutive 
U.S. presidents — Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Coolidge, and Warren 
G. Harding — all offered to cancel part of the $12 billion owed the 
United States by European nations if the Europeans would give 
Germany a break on reparations payments. The European countries 
refused, suggesting that the United States should write off their 
debts anyway since U.S. military and civilian losses had been so 
much smaller than the Allies’ losses.
In 1923, Germany defaulted on its reparations payments. In 
retaliation, France and Belgium invaded the Ruhr River region, 
which was the heart of Germany’s coal and steel industries. 
German workers refused to labor under the foreigners, crippling 
the industries and exacerbating Germany’s already feeble finances.
Trying temporary fixes: The 
Dawes and Young plans
To head off more trouble, Great Britain and the United States 
suggested an international committee be formed to find a 
compromise. The ten-member panel (two each from Belgium, 
France, Britain, Italy, and the United States) was headed by U.S. 
financier Charles G. Dawes. In August 1924, the Dawes committee 
offered a plan under which France and Belgium would vacate the 
Ruhr region, Germany would follow a repayment plan that called 
for smaller payments in the first few years, and international 
bankers would manage some of Germany’s economy.
Dawes, who became U.S. vice president under Coolidge in 1925, 
was a co-recipient of the 1925 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. 
And the plan did help Germany get its inflation under control and 
its economy a little more stabilized.
But by 1929, German unemployment rates were soaring and the 
country was again having trouble making its reparations payments. 
Another international committee was formed, this one chaired by 
U.S. businessman Owen Young, who had served on the Dawes 
committee. The Young panel reduced German payments and 
removed foreign oversight of Germany’s economy.
 
The real fly in the economic ointment applied by the two committees’ 
plans was that they relied on a circular path of finances: The United 
States made large public and private loans to Germany, which 
then used the money to pay reparations to other countries, which 
then used the money to repay their debts to the United States — 
while borrowing another $7.8 billion from U.S. lenders between 1924 
and 1929. As goofy as it was, the system worked for a while.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
110
But as the 1920s ran toward their end, U.S. banks and investors 
became more interested in pouring money into the U.S. stock 
market than into Germany, and U.S. loans eventually stopped. 
When the loans stopped, Germany stopped making reparations, 
and European countries stopped making debt payments to the 
United States. And when the U.S. stock market crashed in late 
1929, U.S. banks withdrew whatever they could get back from their 
investments in Europe, making matters worse for the affected 
countries.
In June 1931, President Hoover proposed a one-year moratorium 
on all the various debt repayments, which was somewhat grumpily 
agreed to by the European countries. But Hoover refused to cancel 
Europe’s debts to the United States altogether. To do so would 
have been highly unpopular with U.S. taxpayers, who saw themselves 
paying higher taxes if the countries the United States had bailed 
out in World War I didn’t pay their debts.
 
“You have no idea what the sentiment of the country at large is on 
the inter-governmental debts,” Hoover wrote financier Thomas 
Lamont in explaining his refusal to forgive the debts.
Germany and Austria, meanwhile, had agreed in spring 1931 to 
form a “customs union” to foster free trade between the two 
countries. This situation alarmed France, which withdrew its large 
deposits from Austria’s main bank. That withdrawal put banks in 
Austria, Germany, and other countries on the edge of collapse. In 
the ensuing economic downturn, German efforts to repay its war 
reparations stopped. All told, it had repaid only about one-eighth 
of what it had agreed to pay.
Making things worse with tariffs
Americans had always had a love-hate relationship with tariffs 
(fees imposed by a country on goods, food, or raw materials 
imported from other countries). That is, Americans who grew, 
manufactured, or mined things generally liked tariffs because the 
fees helped block foreign competition. American consumers, on 
the other hand, generally disliked tariffs because they tended to 
drive up prices. Farmers often opposed tariffs, too, because they 
drove up the prices of manufactured goods.
To help get the country out of a post–World War I slump, Congress 
in 1922 approved a set of tariff rates that were the highest in the 
nation’s history. The tariffs effectively prevented other countries 
from selling much of anything to Americans, which hurt their 
economies. And that situation made it harder for them to pay war 
debts and other U.S. loans. In 1927, a world economic conference 

 Chapter 7: Misery Loves Company: How the Rest of the World Fared 111
concluded that protective tariffs were bad things. An informal mor-
atorium on tariffs was agreed upon, with hopes that tariffs in place 
would eventually be lowered.
 
But in 1929, a Republican-dominated Congress decided to make 
good on a 1928 campaign promise to “protect” U.S. industries and 
farmers. After a fierce fight that took 17 months, Congress narrowly 
approved a bill authored by Representative Willis Hawley of 
Oregon and Senator Reed Smoot of Utah. The Hawley-Smoot Act 
dramatically raised tariffs on more than 650 goods, products, and 
raw materials, from anvils (from 1.5 cents to 3 cents a pound) to 
wool rags (7.5 cents to 18 cents a pound).
The bill raised howls from critics who saw it for what it was: The 
beginning of a trade war. More than 1,000 economists signed a 
petition asking President Hoover to veto the bill. But despite his 
reservations that the bill went much too far, Hoover signed it into 
law. Almost before the ink was dry from the six ceremonial pens 
he used, other countries retaliated with steep tariffs of their own 
against U.S. products. Eventually, 33 nations put up trade barriers. 
That included Great Britain, which had for decades been a champion 
of free trade.
The tariff wars drastically slowed down international trade, which 
dropped from $36 billion in 1929 to $12 billion in 1932. As trade 
slowed and international investments dried up, nations’ economies 
began creaking to a halt. By 1933, unemployment was 20 percent 
or higher in most European countries. The world’s industrial 
productivity rate dropped by 40 percent from its level in the 
mid-1920s. Even non-industrial countries in Latin America and 
Africa were hurt because markets for their agricultural goods and 
raw materials dried up.
Kicking the Gold Habit
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, much of the Western 
world adhered to a monetary system known as the gold standard. 
Basically, it meant a nation tied its currency to gold. Nations could 
then have a good idea what their currency was worth to other 
nations. For example, an ounce of gold could be worth $20 U.S. or 5 
British pounds. That meant a British pound was worth $4 U.S.
The idea was for the system to facilitate international trade because 
everyone would know what everyone else’s money was worth. 
The system would also help prevent inflation (see Chapter 2 for an 
explanation of inflation) because the money supply of each country 
would be tied to the amount of gold it had. And the system would 
help stabilize prices.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
112
 
An example: The United States develops a more efficient way to 
make widgets and can thus sell them for less than British-made 
widgets. British companies that need widgets would then buy U.S. 
widgets, and gold-backed British money would flow to the United 
States. That would increase the U.S. money supply, and the 
resulting currency inflation would raise U.S. widget prices. 
Meanwhile, less gold in Britain would mean less currency, causing 
British widget prices to drop. In theory, British and U.S. widget 
prices would eventually even out.
But for the gold standard system to work, the countries involved 
had to adhere to a few rules (which were completely voluntary). 
They had to keep balanced budgets, where government spending 
was no greater than revenues from taxes. They had to export more 
than they imported, to keep their gold levels up. And they had 
to raise interest rates when their gold holdings sagged. Doing so 
would cause an overall drop in domestic spending, which would 
bring the currency back in line with gold reserves.
The war changes the rules
The gold standard was okay in normal times. But the advent of 
World War I meant combatant countries had to spend a lot of 
money in a hurry. They had to drop the gold standard and switch 
to fiat currency, which is basically money that has no real value 
other than as an agreed-upon medium of exchange. (We agree that 
an apple is worth a piece of paper that says “one dollar.” You give 
me the apple; I give you the piece of paper.)
The advantage of fiat money is that you can put as much as you 
want into circulation, as long as the printing press holds out and 
everyone keeps agreeing the paper is worth goods and services. 
The disadvantage is that it can lead to inflation, where prices go up 
as the money supply goes up.
After the war, countries gradually began returning to the gold 
standard. Between 1924 and 1929, more than 40 nations went back 
to the system, including Britain in 1925, France in 1926, and Italy 
in 1927. (The United States never really left the gold standard 
system.)
 
But the gold standard was a very poor system to have when it 
came to fighting a major recession. Instead of the higher interest 
rates and tighter money supplies dictated by the gold standard, 
effectively fighting a recession calls for lower rates and expanded 
money supplies. Those tools make it easier for businesses to 
borrow and give consumers more to spend — and more confidence 
to spend it.

 Chapter 7: Misery Loves Company: How the Rest of the World Fared 113
Some countries were quicker to pick up on this fact than others, 
and the ones that figured it out first generally started climbing out 
of the Great Depression first. Great Britain and Sweden bailed out 
of the gold standard in 1931 and soon began recovering. France 
didn’t drop it until 1936 and was still staggering when World War II 
began three years later.
In the United States, President Hoover adhered to the economic 
medicine prescribed by classic gold standard theory — and nearly 
poisoned his patient. The U.S. money supply was tightened, interest 
rates were raised, and taxes increased. Things only got worse.
Goodbye, gold standard
When Franklin D. Roosevelt replaced Hoover in March 1933, the 
new president made it clear from the outset that he was far more 
concerned with curing the country’s economic ills than abiding by 
international monetary traditions.
 
“Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in 
point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a 
sound national economy,” Roosevelt said in his inaugural address.
On his second day in office, FDR halted all exports of gold. In April, 
he issued an executive order banning private holdings of gold 
except as jewelry, and he took the country off the gold standard.
A “bombshell message”
In June 1933, representatives of 66 countries convened in London 
at an economic conference. They hoped to find a way to defeat the 
Great Depression through international cooperation and to put 
an end to tariff wars and currency manipulations that had led to a 
“beggar they neighbor” attitude among nations.
Roosevelt sent his Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, as the head of 
a U.S. delegation. American representatives huddled away from 
the main conference with British and French financial experts. The 
expectation among conference delegates was that the “Big Three” 
would come up with a plan to stabilize the world’s currencies.
But on July 3, FDR stunned everyone, including Hull, by proclaiming 
via a telegraph (which came to be known as “the bombshell 
message”) that the United States would not be a party to any plan 
to stabilize exchange rates or currencies, and also wouldn’t be 
going back to the gold standard. In fact, Roosevelt said, the United 
States would be primarily concerned with cleaning up its own 
economic mess.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
114
 
“I do not relish . . . continuance of the basic economic errors that 
underlie so much of the present worldwide depression,” Roosevelt 
said bluntly. “. . . A sound internal economic system of a nation is 
a greater factor in its well-being than the price of its currency in 
changing terms of the currencies of other nations.”
The message effectively ended the conference because without 
the “world’s banker” taking part, a multinational economic plan 
wouldn’t have much chance of succeeding. In April 1934, Roosevelt 
drove a further wedge between the United States and its World 
War I allies by signing a bill that prohibited U.S. banks from making 
loans to countries that were tardy in their war debt payments to 
the United States. Every country except Finland promptly quit 
paying anything. It was clear that countries would have to fight the 
Great Depression on their own.
Looking at the Great Depression 
around the World
In 1933, perhaps for the first time since the early explorers came 
and went, more people left the United States than immigrated to it. 
Part of the reason was due to tighter immigration policies that had 
been in place since the early 1920s. But part of it was due to the 
tough times the United States was going through. (Heck, if that’s 
what people wanted to experience, they could stay home.)
The length and depth of the Great Depression varied from country 
to country. Here’s a quick look at how some other nations fared, 
starting with the United States’ neighbors to the north and south.
Canada
Many Canadians had traditionally gone south in tough times. But 
that tactic didn’t work when times were just as tough in the United 
States. In 1924, more than 200,000 Canadians immigrated to the 
United States. In 1933, only 6,000 did.
The Canadian economy relied heavily on foreign trade in the 
1920s. More than one-third of its gross domestic product (GDP) 
was derived from sales of its raw materials (such as lumber) and 
crops (such as wheat). So when foreign markets dried up, so did 
Canada’s economy. Wheat prices dropped from $1.60 a bushel in 
1929 to 38 cents in 1932. The country’s GDP dropped 40 percent 
from 1929 to 1933.

 Chapter 7: Misery Loves Company: How the Rest of the World Fared 115
Canadian industries had been “protected” by high tariffs. But there 
was no domestic market for what they produced. As a result, hundreds 
of thousands of workers were laid off, with unemployment rates 
reaching as high as 27 percent in 1933.
Canada’s agricultural midsection shared several things in common 
with the U.S. Midwest in the Great Depression, all of them bad. 
Like their Yankee counterparts, Canadian farmers suffered 
through severe drought, scorching temperatures, smothering dust 
storms, and plagues of grasshoppers (see Chapter 6). In fact, the 
Canadians one-upped the Americans by also enduring hailstorms 
that were severe enough to kill horses and destroy entire crops.
Canada’s political leadership during the Great Depression both 
mirrored and contrasted with the U.S. experience. When the hard 
times began, Liberal Party leader William Lyon Mackenzie King 
was prime minister. King lost the post to Conservative Party leader 
Richard D. Bennett in 1930. As staunch a conservative as Herbert 
Hoover, Bennett nonetheless pursued some remedies that were 
surprisingly liberal, such as minimum wage laws and unemployment 
insurance. But Canada’s highest court struck down many of the 
reforms as unconstitutional (just as the U.S. Supreme Court did to 
some of Roosevelt’s New Deal programs). Bennett was ousted in 
1935, and Mackenzie King again assumed leadership.
 
Canada did have two things going for it that the United States 
didn’t. One was a fairly stable banking system. While thousands 
of U.S. banks failed, dragging with them the savings of hundreds 
of thousands of people, not a single Canadian bank failed during 
the period. The other advantage was Canada’s membership in 
the British Commonwealth (a loose confederation of autonomous 
nations with allegiance to the British crown). That association 
helped shield Canada from defaulting on its foreign debts and 
gave it open and tariff-free markets among other Commonwealth 
countries for its exports.
Mexico
There’s an old Mexican saying that the country should be pitied 
because it is “so far from God, so near the United States.”
But that wasn’t completely the case in the Great Depression. True, 
the United States was Mexico’s best customer, and when the U.S. 
economy tanked, Mexican exports were badly hurt, dropping 65 
percent between 1929 and 1932. And true, Mexico had to absorb 
some 300,000 Latinos who were pushed out of the United States as 
unwanted labor during the 1930s (see Chapter 5).

Part II: Getting Depressed  
116
But Mexico had a couple of things going for it that weren’t hurt by 
its proximity to Uncle Sam. First, its export–import ratio stayed in 
the positive column (more going out than coming in) throughout 
the Great Depression (although the ratio did shrink considerably). 
Second, it had plenty of silver on hand.
Mexico had been on a bimetallic standard of both silver and gold. 
But as its money supply contracted and tax revenues shrank, 
the Mexican government, under President Pascual Ortiz Rubio, 
switched to a silver-only standard in July 1931. The country began 
minting silver pesos and issuing millions of silver-backed notes.
 
Mexico benefited further when the prices of silver and oil, both 
of which it exported, went up in 1934. In 1938, President Lázaro 
Cárdenas nationalized (that is, took government control of) 
the oil industry. The railroads had already been nationalized. 
Nationalization meant the Mexican government got the lion’s 
share of the revenues from the railroads and oil production, which 
had heretofore gone to private, and mostly British or American, 
companies.
The result of these changes was that Mexico’s gross domestic 
product actually grew during the Great Depression. The agricultural 
side of the Mexican economy did not fare as well as the industrial 
side. But all in all, Mexico’s experience during the 1930s was less of 
a Great Depression and more of a Not-That-Bad Depression.
Great Britain
The British were already in a bit of a financial hole when what the 
Brits sometimes referred to as the “Great Slump” hit the world in 
late 1929. The pre-Depression doldrums were a result of Britain 
having gone back on the gold standard in 1925. The overvalued 
British pound made the country’s exports expensive and therefore 
hard to sell.
The U.S. stock market crash and the subsequent drying up of U.S. 
loans and investment hit Britain hard. British exports were cut in 
half, and unemployment rose from 1 million in 1929 to 2.5 million in 
1930 and 3 million in 1931 — about 24 percent of the workforce.
The pre–stock market crash government, led by the Labour 
Party, gave way to a coalition government dominated by the 
Conservative Party. The government cut wages of public sector 
workers and reduced payments to a financially shaky unemployment 
insurance system. The system was funded by employee contributions 
and covered relatively few people. The government also raised 
income taxes. The results were an increase in unemployment and a 
decrease in economic activity.

 Chapter 7: Misery Loves Company: How the Rest of the World Fared 117
In 1931, Great Britain went off the gold standard and instituted 
a government-funded unemployment insurance system. The 
government also held down public sector spending, kept private-
sector wages down, and in short did everything it could to keep 
the costs of manufactured goods for export down. That was 
important because Britain imported more than half its food and 
needed a healthy balance between what it sold and bought from 
abroad.
 
The cumulative effect of the British efforts was that its economy 
did not fall as far or crash as hard as the U.S. economy. By 1935, 
British unemployment was at a more reasonable 10 percent. In the 
last half of the decade, the country’s economy was further boosted 
by heavy government spending on rebuilding Britain’s military in 
anticipation of a showdown with Nazi Germany. That turned out to 
be a wise investment.
France
The French got to the world’s Depression party a little late and 
stayed until it was almost over. Unlike other countries, France had 
been more wary about speculative investments in extravagant 
building projects — or the U.S. stock market. As a result, its 
monetary system was in better shape than those of other nations, 
and it held large gold reserves.
French unemployment rates were also low in the first years of the 
Great Depression, in part because it had lost so many work-aged 
men during World War I. But the global slump finally caught up 
with France in 1932. Tourism and the foreign sales of French 
products such as perfume slowed. Unemployment rates reached 
15 percent in 1932. While not as steep as in other nations, the rate 
stayed at that level for several years. A series of strikes led to an 
agreement between labor and management to increase salaries 
and thus stimulate the economy. That step had only moderate 
success, and the French economy continued to sputter until World 
War II shifted its attention to other matters.
Latin America
Latin American countries were generally vulnerable to the fallout 
from the Great Depression and pretty powerless to do much about 
it. Many of the nations in Central and South America were heavily 
dependent on the export of crops (such as coffee) or raw materials 
(such as oil or iron ore). When international demand waned, the 
Latin American nations could do little with their own products 
because many of them lacked much in the way of manufacturing 
plants.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
118
The other big problem many Latin American countries had was 
that their biggest trading partner and investor was the United 
States, and in the early 1930s, Uncle Sam wasn’t buying much and 
didn’t have anything to lend.
But a couple of things worked in the region’s favor. It didn’t have 
much absolute need for imported goods, and its unemployment 
problems were addressed by the fact that many out-of-work 
people in the cities simply returned to subsistence farming in the 
rural areas and were not dependent on government welfare or 
unemployment insurance programs.
Some countries were hit harder than others. In Brazil, which was 
run by a dictator named Getulio Vargas, the country’s textile 
industry ramped up as its coffee industry sagged. Vargas was 
also chummy with fellow dictators in Germany and Italy, and he 
established coffee-for-machinery barter arrangements. In Chile, 
on the other hand, the country’s main exports were iron ore 
and copper, the demand for which fell sharply. Chilean exports 
dropped 76 percent from 1929 to 1933 while its imports dropped 
more than 80 percent.
 
If there was a cheery note in the Great Depression for Latin 
American countries, it was that after World War II, the region 
found itself far less dependent on the United States for trade and 
investment, having gotten along without it during the 1930s.
Africa
Most of the African continent was still under colonial domination 
by European powers at the onset of the Great Depression. Private 
companies that held virtual monopolies often dominated the 
economies of African colonies.
Because of this situation, the companies — rather than the 
Africans themselves — bore the direct brunt of the Depression. 
In many cases, the companies responded to lower prices for their 
products by flooding the market, which served to drive prices 
down even more.
But while the companies and colonial governments felt the initial 
sting of the economic downturn, Africans weren’t entirely spared. 
In some cases, colonial governments replaced lost sales revenues 
with various taxes on workers. In the Belgian Congo, failure to pay 
the taxes resulted in forced labor, which amounted to slavery. In 
other white-dominated colonies such as Rhodesia, Africans were 
forced to abide by labor “contracts” that had the same effect as 
serfdom.

 Chapter 7: Misery Loves Company: How the Rest of the World Fared 119
Linking Depression and Despotism
In 1920, the British economist John Maynard Keynes morosely 
noted that the victorious nations of World War I had been so 
spiteful and selfish that the losers were sure to someday rise up 
and shake off the second-class status to which they had been 
relegated.
 
“Men will not always die quietly,” Keynes wrote. “For starvation, 
which brings to some lethargy and a helpless despair, drives other 
temperaments to the nervous instability of hysteria, and to a mad 
despair. And these in their distress may overturn the remnants of 
organization, and submerge civilization itself.”
The Great Depression was tailor-made for triggering the madness 
of which Keynes wrote. People weren’t quite sure how the world 
got into this mess and were even less sure how to get out of it. But 
that fact didn’t deter some individuals who were remarkable for 
their abilities of persuasion, their charisma, and their monstrous 
thirst for power at any cost.
In Japan, a collection of military officers seized control. In Italy, the 
power went to a former schoolteacher: Benito Mussolini. Germany 
was dominated by a failed painter from Austria: Adolph Hitler. 
And Russia was ruled by a seminary student–turned bank robber–
turned revolutionary: Joseph Stalin. Following is a brief look at 
how these countries fared economically.
Military Japan
Japan was still relatively new to industrialization in the 1920s, 
and its leaders strove to adapt Western technology and industrial 
methods. But the country was heavily dependent on trade for 
importing fuel and raw materials, and it didn’t have a wide variety 
of goods to export. In the late 1920s, its silk exports faced competition 
from artificial fabrics made in the West, and the value of Japanese 
exports dropped by 50 percent between 1929 and 1932. Bad rice 
harvests compounded Japan’s economic troubles.
These economic troubles sparked sharp anti-Western feelings and 
led to fervent nationalism. They also helped the army gradually gain 
control of the government. With government assent, Japanese textile 
manufacturers began exploiting the workforce, paying starvation 
wages and requiring workers to live in barracks at the mills.

The army also successfully pressed for increased industrialization 
so more military equipment, weapons, and other supplies could 
be produced. By 1937, Japan had conquered much of China, and 
its military efforts helped pull the country through the Great 
Depression.
Mussolini’s Italy
Benito Mussolini had come to power in Italy well before the onset 
of the Great Depression. After becoming prime minister in 1922, 
Mussolini quickly developed an almost completely undeserved 
reputation as a master planner who ran an efficient and economical 
government. In reality, “Il Duce” (“The Leader”) was erratic and 
contradictory. But he was also lucky. Italy’s unions and business 
leaders were relatively docile and rarely blinked at his economic 
efforts.
Those efforts included starting a “Battle for Land,” which consisted 
of draining swampland to create farms, and coercing Italians to 
trade their gold coins and jewelry in return for a steel wristband 
that said “Gold for the Fatherland” on it. He also forced citizens to 
turn over foreign stocks and bonds to the national bank, and he 
nationalized about 75 percent of Italy’s businesses.
When all was said and done, Mussolini didn’t really screw up the 
Italian economy too much. The Great Depression didn’t hit it all 
that hard. Of course the Italian economy wasn’t all that big a 
deal to begin with. In fact, with only 2.8 percent of the world’s 
manufacturing, Italy was the least economically important of 
Europe’s big countries.
Hitler’s Germany
In November 1923, a doughy little guy with a silly mustache 
jumped on a table in a Munich beer hall and proclaimed “the 
Nationalist Revolution.” Adolf Hitler was promptly arrested and 
served a year in prison, long enough to put together his plans for 
when he got out. Using what a 1933 Time magazine article called 
the “Sheer gift of gab, lung power and personal magnetism,” Hitler 
rose to prominence at the head of the National Socialist, or Nazi, 
Party. By early 1933, the Nazis controlled the German Parliament, 
and Hitler had been named chancellor. Later, he became known 
simply as Der Führer (The Leader).

 Chapter 7: Misery Loves Company: How the Rest of the World Fared 121
When Hitler came to power, the German economy was in shambles. 
Unemployment was nearing 30 percent. But the Nazis quickly 
developed a mass jobs-creation program fueled by huge 
governmental investments in public works projects that ranged 
from highways to affordable automobiles called “the People’s 
Cars,” or “Volkswagens.” Inflation was managed by rationing 
consumer goods, discouraging discretionary spending, and 
implementing wage and price controls.
As the decade moved along, Germany also began re-arming itself, 
spending huge amounts to create an industrial infrastructure that 
could churn out war machinery. By 1939, German unemployment 
was nearly invisible, and the country’s gross domestic product 
was 50 percent higher than it had been in 1929. Hitler had led the 
creation of a war machine, a part of which can be seen in Figure 7-1. 
Germany was ready for a world war.

Stalin’s Soviet Union
It’s safe to say that no world leader in the 1930s committed more 
crimes against humanity in the name of economic progress than 
Joseph Stalin. It’s probably also safe to say that no leader pulled 
the wool over the eyes of the world better than Stalin.
Stalin, who came to power in the mid-1920s, was pushing to turn 
the Soviet Union away from an agriculture-based economy to an 
industrial economy well before the onset of the Great Depression. 
He also wanted to make the country as economically self-sufficient 
as possible. And he was largely successful in both efforts. In 1926, 
about 80 percent of the Soviet populace lived on farms. By 1939, 
about 50 percent did. Because the country didn’t rely on international 
trade, it weathered the Great Depression without severe upheaval.
At least that’s what it looked like to the outside world. Americans 
were effusive in their praise of what seemed to be an efficient 
economic system. The esteemed newspaper editor William Allen 
White called the Soviet Union “the most interesting place on the 
planet.” Humorist Will Rogers observed that “those rascals in 
Russia . . . have got mighty good ideas. Just think of everybody in a 
country going to work.”
 
In fact, a lot of jobless Americans thought it was a great idea. In 
1931, a New York City–based Soviet trade agency named Amtorg 
announced that it had 6,000 jobs for skilled workers in the USSR. 
More than 100,000 Americans applied, and about 10,000 eventually 
went.
What they found when they got there was a nightmare. Stalin’s 
method of getting people to move off farms to factories, or to 
build canals and roads, was to totally disregard their right to live. 
It’s estimated that as many as 14 million people died in Stalin’s 
“collectivization” of farms, which meant turning them from modest 
enterprises into massive agricultural factories. The food supplies 
for entire villages were seized and transferred elsewhere, leaving 
the villagers to starve. By 1934, another 500,000 Soviet citizens 
were in gulags, or prison camps, where they were used as slave 
laborers.
Many of the Americans who immigrated to Stalin’s Soviet Union 
were not allowed to leave. A New Jersey mechanical engineer who 
did come back to the United States told a magazine reporter that 
“The people are in rags. There is depression everywhere . . . how 
anything fine or good can come from such squalor and misery is 
more than I can understand.”

Lessons Learned
Two of the lessons learned from the Great Depression are these:
 
✓ In an economic crisis, international cooperation is better than 
competition.
 
✓ Rigid currency systems aren’t a good idea in tough times.
Here is a look at two organizations that seek to foster international 
economic cooperation, and a brief recounting of what happened to 
the gold standard after the Great Depression.
The World Bank
In July 1944, representatives of 45 nations met in the town of 
Breton Woods, New Hampshire, to build a framework to help 
countries get along, economically speaking, after World War II 
ended. One idea to bear fruit was the creation of a World Bank.
With more than 180 countries as members, the World Bank keeps 
tabs on global economic issues and provides advice — and 
money — to developing countries. The bank is headquartered in 
Washington, D.C., and is run by a board of 24 directors. The voting 
power of each country is determined by its deposits in the bank. At 
the start of the 21st century, the United States controlled about 17 
percent of the votes, more than twice as many as runner-up Japan.
The World Bank is organized into five institutions:
 
✓ International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(IBRD): It provides loans, at market interest rates, to middle-
income developing countries.
 
✓ International Development Association (IDA): It provides 
interest-free loans to low-income developing countries.
 
✓ International Finance Corporation (IFC): It provides loans 
and loan guarantees to private sector business deals within 
developing countries.
 
✓ Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA): It 
provides loan insurance against loss from noncommercial 
risks such as political coups or civil wars within developing 
countries.
 
✓ International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes 
(ICSID): It arbitrates arguments among investors and 
developing countries.

Part II: Getting Depressed  
124
The World Bank has been criticized for requiring borrowing 
nations to adopt government structural reforms that hurt education 
and social service programs, and for rules that prohibited the 
bank from canceling or restructuring debts. But it was also highly 
praised for its efforts in helping communist nations switch to a free 
market system in the 1980s and 1990s.
The International Monetary Fund 
and the end of the gold standard
Like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was 
born at the 1944 Breton Woods conference. The idea was to 
establish an organization that would monitor the world’s monetary 
system and try to head off the fiscal feuding that had marked the 
Great Depression.
Countries that joined the IMF agreed to keep their currencies tied 
to the U.S. dollar, which would be tied to gold, at $35 an ounce. 
That meant, for example, that eight Mexican pesos would be 
worth one U.S. dollar, and therefore eight Mexican pesos were 
worth 1/35th of an ounce of gold. Currency exchange rates could 
be adjusted only when trade balances got severely out of whack, 
and only with IMF approval. The idea was to create some stability 
among the world’s currencies and prevent countries from 
devaluing their currency so their goods would be cheaper and thus 
more attractive than competing countries’ goods in global markets.
But by the end of the 1960s, the system was putting too great a 
strain on the U.S. economy. The expenses of the Vietnam War 
and the sweeping “Great Society” social service programs under 
President Lyndon B. Johnson meant the United States needed to 
put more money into circulation than the IMF system would 
allow. So in August 1971, President Richard M. Nixon ended the 
convertibility of U.S. dollars into gold.
The result was that nations’ currencies were free to float against 
each other. That change turned out to be a pretty good thing 
because it gave countries more flexibility when it came to dealing 
with economic crises such as the oil embargoes in the mid 1970s.
Since 1971, the IMF has focused on monitoring its 185 member 
countries’ economic situations, giving them advice and lending 
money when necessary. The IMF differs from the World Bank in 
that the bank focuses on long-term help for developing nations, 
while the IMF concentrates on currency and financial sector 
situations.

Great Depression

In this part . . . 
B
eyond all the facts and fi gures and economic data of 
the Great Depression are the people who lived 
through it. How they did so is every bit as instructive as 
all the numbers — and much more interesting.
This part starts with the story of Americans on the road, 
some trying to escape a life in ruins, others looking for a 
better life just over the next state line. Then it covers 
some of the period’s true characters, from machine gun–
toting desperadoes to homegrown Nazis and communists.
The part continues with a look at how Americans coped 
with the doom and gloom by going to the movies or 
pursuing other diversions. It ends with the story of 
organized labor during the Great Depression, perhaps the 
only part of the economy that did pretty well during the era.

▶ Lessons learned
W
hen faced with the hard times and uncertainty of the Great 
Depression, most Americans hunkered down at or near 
home. The best course for them seemed to be to wait things out in 
familiar surroundings. But hundreds of thousands of others decided 
that maybe, just maybe, things would be better someplace else.
This chapter looks at who hit the road during the 1930s, with the 
focus on two of the largest groups that did so. The first group 
was the young: people under the age of 21 who saw no future for 
themselves at home. The second group was the families who fled 
the drought-stricken farms of southwestern states for the promise 
of a new start in California.
The “Wandering Population”
As the Great Depression’s impact deepened in 1932, it became 
clear that local government and private organizations were not 
going to be able to handle the huge numbers of people who needed 
help. The ranks of the unemployed had swelled to the point of 
bursting. Only about a quarter of those who needed aid were 
getting it, and most of that relief was in the form of just enough 
food to survive. Many people began to think that life elsewhere 
couldn’t possibly be as bad as it was at home. So they went to see.
By the end of 1932, an estimated 2 million Americans were on 
the road. Up to 25 percent of them were believed to be under the 
age of 21.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
128
 
“The Depression,” reported Fortune magazine in September 1932, 
“along with its misery, (has) produced its social curiosities, 
not the least of which is the wandering population it spilled upon 
the roads. Means of locomotion vary, but the objective is always 
the same — somewhere else. There were the hitchhikers whose 
thumbs jerked onward along the American pike, and the number 
of spavined Fords dragging destitute families from town to town in 
search of a solvent relative or a generous friend.”
Riding the rails
As Fortune noted, many people hitchhiked or piled what possessions 
they could squeeze into the family car or truck and drove off. But 
many took to the railroads that crisscrossed the country — not 
inside passenger coaches as paying customers, but hidden away in 
boxcars filled with human cargo.
In 1927, the Southern Pacific Railroad reported evicting 78,099 
trespassers from trains or railroad yards. By 1932, the number was 
683,457. In just one month during that year, the railroad reported, 
it evicted 80,000 transients from boxcars in California alone. An 
average of 700 “train hoppers” per day passed through Kansas 
City, Missouri.
But hopping a freight train was a tricky and dangerous business: 
In 1932, the Interstate Commerce Commission reported, 5,962 
trespassers were killed on and around trains, 1,508 of them under 
the age of 21.
Some of the transients had been riding the rails well before the 
Great Depression started, as part of the “invisible poor” during 
the seemingly opulent decade of the Roaring Twenties. But the 
overwhelming numbers of people riding the rails or hitchhiking 
around the country were those who had no other particular place 
to be. They were dispossessed farmers and laid-off factory workers.
 
The writer Thomas Wolfe described them as “the flotsam of the 
general ruin of the time — honest, decent middle-aged men with 
faces seamed by toil and want, and young men, many of them 
teens, with their unkempt hair. These were wanderers from town 
to town, the riders of freight trains, the thumbers of rides on 
highways, the uprooted, unwanted male population of America.”
Not all of the wanderers were men. The estimates of the number of 
women on the road or riding the rails varied from about 15,000 to 
more than 100,000. Women often dressed like men, both because it 
was more practical for travel and also to keep a lower profile and 
thus reduce the risk of assault. Other women wanderers viewed 

 Chapter 8: On the Road 129
the risks of assault as part of the life. “You have to put up on the 
road with certain things,” a young woman told a social worker in 
1937, “and you got to give in when forced.”
Some women got by as prostitutes, risking rape, pregnancy, and 
disease for as little as a dime a customer. “So one day a guy says 
to me ‘get wise, sister, get wise,’” a teenage transient told Thomas 
Minehan, a University of Minnesota sociologist who traveled the 
rails doing interviews in 1932 and 1933. “So I got wise.”
“Waiting for nothing”
Many of the nation’s new transients were high school and college 
graduates who had both careers and senses of self-worth that were 
snuffed out by their new lives.
 
“It is the first couple of weeks at tramping that hurt a man the 
most,” a 25-year-old mechanical draftsman told The Forum magazine 
in early 1932. “Added to the uneasiness of any animal in a strange 
environment is the human feeling of depravity from his beggar’s 
status. One talks badly, goes hungry for unnecessarily long periods 
of time . . . goes blocks out of his way to avoid policemen.”
Thomas Kromer, an unemployed teacher, wrote an account of his 
life on the road called Waiting For Nothing. In it, he describes a 
typical meal at a homeless shelter: “They shove this stew before 
us. It is awful. It smells bad. The room is full of the stench of this 
rotten stew. What am I going to do? What can I do? I am a hungry 
man. Food is food to a hungry man, whether it is rotten or not. I’ve 
got to eat.”
Once someone was on the road, it was hard to get off. Few employ-
ers were willing to give a job to a stranger who looked like a bum. 
“Believe me sir,” a transient told a federal investigator, “three days 
in a box car, in zero weather, without water, sleep or food would 
make anybody look like a thug. But give me three days of heat, 
food, soap and water, a razor and a bed, and I will look just as 
I am — a graduate of the University of Chicago.”
Being run off or arrested
Vagrancy became a national problem. Local relief agencies 
couldn’t cover the needs of their own residents, let alone tens 
of thousands of transients. States were similarly overwhelmed. 
So local and state authorities devised other methods of handling 
unwelcome visitors. For example,

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
130
 
✓ Signs outside the city limits of Tucson, Arizona, read, 
“Warning to Transients. Relief Funds for local residents only. 
Transients, do not apply.”
 
✓ In Atlanta, Georgia, transients were arrested and sentenced to 
30 days in jail, and then they were rented out as forced labor 
to the state highway department or even private companies.
 
✓ The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce seriously suggested 
establishing concentration camps for transients. The L.A. 
police chief came up with an alternative: blockading the entire 
state from “undesirable elements.” See “The bums blockade” 
sidebar for details.
In 1932, Congress considered making vagrancy a federal crime, 
but the body’s saner members prevailed, and the proposal was 
dropped. In 1933, the Roosevelt administration established the 
Federal Transient Program. By January 1934, 40 states had federally 
funded transient aid programs operating. But in most cases, the 
sheer numbers of applicants overwhelmed the program, and it 
was closed in late 1935. The transient problem continued until the 
United States entered World War II in late 1941.
The bums blockade
With its hospitable year-round climate, California was a magnet for transients 
during the Great Depression. The state held just 4.7 percent of the entire U.S. popu-
lation, but by June 1934 was hosting 14 percent of the country’s transients. So in 
February 1936, Los Angeles Police Chief James Edgar “Two Guns” Davis decided to 
stem the flow of transients by sending 126 of his officers to entry points around the 
state. There they stopped anyone who looked “undesirable.” (The first man stopped 
was a 62-year-old Chicago native who had been riding freights for four days in 
freezing weather.) If they had no money and no job, they were offered a choice of 
turning around or being arrested and serving six months in jail, where, Davis said, 
they would find only “beans and abuse.”
A federal court judge warned Davis the blockades were unconstitutional. The sheriff 
of one county chased the LAPD out of his jurisdiction. The department became the 
butt of national jokes. (A sign reading “Los Angeles City Limits” was put up just outside 
Reno, Nevada.) But Davis refused to recall his men, and hundreds of transients were 
refused entrance (much to the consternation of officials in the neighboring states of 
Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon, who were left as hosts for the blocked transients).
In early April 1936, a Hollywood film director, who had been refused entrance to 
the state by deputies because of his unkempt appearance, sued Davis. After it was 
revealed that the chief’s top aide had threatened to bomb the director’s house if he 
didn’t drop the suit, Davis finally recalled his officers. The chief abruptly retired in 1938 
after a corruption probe threatened his pension. And the transients kept coming.

 Chapter 8: On the Road 131
The “Boxcar Children”
In early April 1934, a 15-year-old boy stood before a judge in Salt 
Lake City and told his story. The boy’s name was Robert Cozad. 
Up until about a year before his appearance in court, Cozad had 
worked on a farm near Muscatine, Iowa. When he lost the job, he 
told the judge, he began “riding the brakes,” or hopping freight 
trains to look for work.
 
“I tried to get home last winter from San Diego, where a police 
officer let me work in a gymnasium and sleep there,” Cozad said. 
“But out of St. Louis, I almost froze to death, so I beat it back to 
California. I started three days ago to try again to get home. I was 
in a boxcar out of Las Vegas with about 30 men, and a brakeman 
found me shivering. Today I was arrested. I told them I was not 
quite 16 and expected to be on the next freight out of Salt Lake.”
Instead of catching a freight, Cozad (who eventually went home, 
served in World War II, and died in 1990 at the age of 72) was put 
on a work detail at a nearby federal flood control project.
There were a lot of kids like Robert Cozad during the Great 
Depression. They were variously referred to in the newspapers as 
“the boxcar children,” “the wandering youth,” or “the wild boys.” 
Some were on the road for the adventure. But most were there 
for the same reasons their older counterparts on the road were 
there: hard times. In his 1934 book Boy and Girl Tramps of America, 
sociologist Thomas Minehan said 83 percent of the 466 homeless 
youths he interviewed gave “hard times at home” as their answer 
for being on the road.
“He didn’t exactly kick me out, but he gave me plenty of hints,” 
a 17-year-old boy named Joe told Minehan about how his father 
helped put him on the road. “He hasn’t worked steady in the 
last three years. There’s seven of us at home, and I’m the 
oldest . . . I thought I’d stay until Christmas. I got the kids a duck 
for Christmas, but I ain’t saying how I got it. Then, before the old 
man could start giving any more hints, I scrams.”
 
In 1932, the National Children’s Bureau estimated that as many as 
250,000 youths under the age of 21 were on their own and homeless. 
Others put the number as high as 1 million. Testifying before a 
congressional committee in 1933, the chief special agent of the 
Southern Pacific Railroad Company estimated that “75 percent 
of the 1932 (rail) trespassers ranged in age from 16 to 25 years.” 
Sociologist Minehan reported that the youths he came in contact 
with in his study were as young as 11 and had been on their own 
for an average of 14 months.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
132
 
“The migratory youth is a product of these times which have 
upset a whole world,” a Detroit News reporter wrote, somewhat 
melodramatically, in 1933. “His elders, his friends, his teachers, his 
parents have failed to understand a perplexed youth. They have 
driven him from his home into the physical and moral hazards of 
transiency.”
Locking up the schools
One of the reasons so many kids were on the road and in the 
streets was because a traditional anchor of childhood — the 
classroom — was locked up.
 
Money to pay teachers and heat classrooms simply dried up. 
Many, if not most, public schools in the United States ended their 
1933–34 school year in January 1934. Five thousand of them 
were closed for the entire year. There were 25,000 fewer 
U.S. schoolteachers in 1934 than in 1930. Forty percent of the 
10 million high school–age kids in 1935 were not in school.
Not everyone thought this situation was a tragedy. Automaker 
Henry Ford opined that “it’s the best education in the world for 
these boys, this traveling around. They get more experience in a 
few weeks than they would in years at school.”
If Ford was right, it was fortuitous that they were getting some 
experience at something: A 1934 survey of 200,000 Pennsylvania 
youths looking for jobs found that 71 percent had never been 
employed. Without experience, they weren’t likely to be employed 
during times as bad as the Great Depression.
Giving boys a purpose: The CCC
One federal program that was almost certainly the nearest and 
dearest to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s heart was the Civilian 
Conservation Corps (CCC). The program, which put needy young 
males to work restoring and improving federal lands, married 
two of Roosevelt’s keen interests: conservation, and giving young 
people a purpose in life.
 
“It is my belief that what is being accomplished will conserve our 
natural resources, create future national wealth and prove of moral 
and spiritual value not only to those of you who are taking part, 
but to the rest of the country as well,” the president said in a July 
1933 message in the CCC’s official newspaper. “It’s my honest 
conviction that what you are doing in the way of constructive 
service will bring to you, personally and individually, returns the 
value of which it is difficult to estimate.”

 Chapter 8: On the Road 133
 
So eager was Roosevelt to get the program started that the first 
boy was enrolled 35 days after FDR took office in March 1933. By 
July, 1,300 camps housed 274,000 boys on federal lands throughout 
the country.
To qualify, applicants had to be between the ages of 18 and 25. 
(Later, the range was expanded to 17 to 28.) They had to be male, 
single, jobless, and at least 60 inches tall. They had to weigh at 
least 107 pounds, have “at least three working teeth,” and be in 
good physical condition. Enlistments were for six-month terms 
that could be extended to as long as two years (or longer if the 
young man was promoted). The “soil soldiers,” as they were called, 
got $30 a month, at least $22 of which had to be sent home.
The CCC was a multi-jurisdictional affair. The camps were built and 
maintained by the U.S. Army, while the work details were run by 
the U.S. Forest Service and supervised by “local experienced men,” 
known as LEMs. The LEMs were paid $45 a month.
Liberals didn’t like the army’s involvement, fearing the program 
would amount to forced military training. They also didn’t like the 
low pay. Conservatives thought it a bad idea to give thousands of 
members of the lower classes military training, for fear they might 
use it someday against the government.
The program did have its troubles. One camp commander in 
Oklahoma was killed by one of his charges. Another was arrested 
for providing members with prostitutes and liquor. Despite rules 
that specifically prohibited it, most camps were strictly segregated, 
and in the end, only 7 percent of the CCC members were African 
American. Moreover, as a relief project it was fairly insignificant 
because it helped relatively few individuals and families. But it did 
have some triumphs too.
Leaving their mark on the land
The work done by the CCC was varied in scope and impressive in 
quantity. Members built 47,000 bridges and 318,000 check dams 
to fight erosion. They fought fires and floods, marked thousands 
of miles of trails, constructed amphitheaters and boathouses, 
and planted more than 1 billion trees. They planted hatchery fish, 
drained bogs, and restored farmland. Many CCC projects can still 
be seen in state and national parks around the country.
At its peak in September 1935, the CCC had 502,000 members in 
2,514 camps. By the time it closed in 1942 (because of World War II), 
2.9 million boys and young men had been through the program.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
134
 
“We built something, and I knew I had helped,” one CCC member 
recalled. “It was something you could take pride in, and there 
wasn’t a lot of pride available in those days.”
The Real-Life Grapes of Wrath
In March 1939, Viking Press published a novel by California author 
John Steinbeck called The Grapes of Wrath. The book told the 
story of the Joads, a 1930s Oklahoma family run off their land by 
foreclosure. Loading up family members from three generations, 
the Joads headed west in a sedan turned into a truck, to what 
they hoped would be a new start in California. Along the way, 
they encountered all sorts of hardship, including having both 
grandparents die. When they got to California, they were met 
mostly with hostility, prejudice, and exploitation. The story 
doesn’t end on an upbeat note.
The novel electrified the country. By the end of its first year in 
publication, it had sold 430,000 copies. The book, wrote First Lady 
Eleanor Roosevelt in her syndicated newspaper column, “made 
you dread sometimes to begin the next chapter, and yet you 
cannot lay the book down or even skip a page.”
 
Not everyone loved the novel, which won a Pulitzer Prize and 
helped Steinbeck eventually win a Nobel Prize for literature. 
California farm owners screamed that it was an unfair vilification 
of them. Oklahoma officials weren’t happy that it made their state 
look like hell on earth. Time magazine called it “a so-so book” 
infected with “exaggerations, propaganda and phony pathos.”
“So-so” or not, by the end of 1940 the story of the fictional Joads 
had been made into a hit movie and helped trigger a congressional 
investigation into the plight of real-life migrant farm families.
There were certainly plenty of real-life migrant families, mostly 
from what was then referred to as “the Southwest” or “Cotton 
Belt”: Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, and Arkansas. Most of the 
migrant families from those states ended up in adjacent states. But 
hundreds of thousands followed the route of the Joads, moving 
west. Many headed to Oregon and Washington, seeking jobs on 
mammoth federal dam-building projects. Far more went to 
California. In one 14-month span between June 1935 and 
September 1936, 86,000 people from the southwestern states 
entered California, part of 350,000 migrants who came from all 
over the country to the state between 1935 and 1940.

 Chapter 8: On the Road 135
Telling the rest of the story
Steinbeck’s saga didn’t tell the whole story of the exodus, however. 
For one thing, more than half of the Cotton Belt migrants weren’t 
even farmers or farm laborers. About 40 percent were blue-collar 
workers, and another 16 percent were managers, proprietors, or 
other white-collar workers. Many of them had relatives who had 
been living in California for years and offered them a place to live 
and sometimes even jobs when they got there. They settled in 
metropolitan regions, particularly around Los Angeles. Between 
1935 and 1940, census figures showed about 100,000 people from 
the Cotton Belt settled in and around Los Angeles.
Even those who were farmers seemed to have good reasons to go 
to California. One reason was better wages. In 1935, the average 
daily wage of a California farm worker was $2.95, with some form 
of housing included. In Oklahoma, it was $1.35, with no housing. 
“People think they are just a’flyin’ if they can get $3 a day,” one 
arrival from Arkansas told a University of California researcher.
Trouble was, there were a lot more workers than work. A billboard 
on U.S. Route 66 outside Tulsa, Oklahoma, told the tale: “NO JOBS 
in California/ IF YOU are looking for work — KEEP OUT/ 6 Men for 
Every Job/ No State Relief Available for Non-Residents.”
But there was cotton in California. The crop, which had barely 
existed in California before the 1920s, was booming in the 1930s. 
Cotton acreage grew from 170,000 acres to more than 600,000 
acres from 1927 to 1937. In the Cotton Belt, meanwhile, a federal 
program designed to help farmers get back on their feet was 
actually driving many of them off the land.
Contributing to the great 
migration: The AAA
In 1933, the federal government instituted the Agricultural 
Adjustment Act (which I cover in more detail in Chapter 6). 
Basically, the act was designed to reduce overproduction, and 
therefore raise farm prices, by paying subsidies to farmers in 
return for less being planted. Landowners who rented part of their 
property were supposed to share the subsidies with their renters, 
but there was almost no government oversight to see that they 
did. “I did everything the government told me to,” boasted one 
Oklahoma landowner, “except keep my renters.”

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
136
 
Instead, many landowners used the federal money to buy tractors 
and/or hire day laborers while evicting their tenants. “I bought 
tractors on the money the government give me and got shed of my 
renters,” a landowner said. “They got their choice — California or 
WPA,” a government relief program.
Coupled with the loss of as many as 20 percent of the Cotton Belt’s 
small farms to foreclosure notices, the unintended consequence 
of the federal program was enough to push tens of thousands of 
farmers and their families to choose California.
Heading west
 
Although the Joads’ trip in The Grapes of Wrath took on aspects 
of a forced death march, the trip from the southwestern states to 
“the Golden State” wasn’t that arduous for most people. The most 
favored route was U.S. Route 66, which ran from Chicago through 
Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and the deserts of New Mexico and 
Arizona to the Pacific Ocean at Santa Monica. Some people took 
buses or trains, or paid $10 for a ride with another family going 
west.
Gasoline cost 10 cents a gallon; a car or truck in reasonably good 
shape could make the trip in three or four days. (Of course, as 
Figure 8-1 shows, not all vehicles were up to the task.) Most people 
camped along the road. Studies showed that the average family of 
four or five had $40 in cash and a net worth of about $200, including 
the vehicle they were riding in.
Still, there were poignant stories to rival those of Steinbeck’s 
protagonists. One woman with six children was stopped at the 
California border and told she had to buy a $3 auto license. 
Tearfully, she told the police officer that she had only $3.40, adding 
“that’s food for my babies.” He gave her the license, and she was 
allowed into California.

Life in California
Despite its “promised land” image in many of the decade’s movies, 
California was not an economic oasis that escaped the cold hands 
of the Great Depression. Unemployment in the state reached as 
high as 29 percent in early 1933, and local government and private 
relief agencies faced uphill battles in providing food and temporary 
shelter for the needy.
But the state did recover quicker than most of the states in the 
Midwest and East, and even in the middle of the decade, wages 
were generally higher in California. Meat packers, for example, 
were paid 68 cents an hour in California in 1935, compared to 
46 cents in Oklahoma or Texas. Machine shop workers earned 
67 cents, compared to 60 cents in Texas or Oklahoma.

The prospect of better wages and the presence of friends and 
family already living in the state were what drew many of the 
Southwesterners to California. Many of them moved to new 
communities on the outskirts of metropolitan areas. A typical 
newspaper ad offered small lots for “$20 down, and $10 a month,” 
and promised neighborhoods with “Good schools, churches, fine 
water” (and assurances to the almost exclusively white newcomers 
that the new communities were “race restricted”). Assimilating in 
the urban areas was a fairly smooth process for the newcomers. 
But for those Southwesterners who gravitated to California’s vast 
Central Valley, it was a different story.
Fitting in where they weren’t wanted
The Central Valley of California is really two valleys that run right 
into each other. To the north is the Sacramento Valley; to the 
south the San Joaquin Valley. The San Joaquin Valley is cotton 
country, and that’s where most of the Southwesterners went when 
they arrived in California.
Unlike most of the country at the time, California agriculture was 
dominated by huge enterprises that were more crop factories than 
family farms. In 1939, Fortune magazine reported that fewer than 
10 percent of California farms produced half of the state’s crops, 
while the small farms that made up 41 percent of the total number 
of farms produced less than 6 percent of the crops.
The large farms had always been dependent on seasonal workers 
to get the crops in, and waves of migrants had filled the role: first 
Chinese, then Japanese, then Mexicans and Filipinos. At the outset 
of the Great Depression, 300,000 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans 
had been forced or coerced into leaving the United States because 
they were thought to be taking up jobs that could be filled by 
whites. (See Chapter 5 for more on the Latino exodus.)
The Southwesterners seemed to be the perfect replacements. But 
there was a big difference between the newcomers and the migrant 
workers who had come before. In most cases, California’s migrant 
workers had been male adults and youths who moved from place 
to place as different crops came to harvest.
 
With few exceptions, however, the Southwesterners tended to 
stay put. That caused problems, as a 1937 report from San Joaquin 
Valley health officials pointed out: “Growers have lost their fluid 
Mexican workers, who miraculously appeared on harvest day and 
silently slipped away after the work is done . . . the large families 
of the Southwesterners harvest the cotton (but) when the cotton 
is harvested, the family hangs on, swelling our emergency relief 
rolls.”

 Chapter 8: On the Road 139
The region was not equipped to permanently house migrant 
workers who didn’t migrate after the crops were in. So the new-
comers set up squalid settlements of tents and patched-together 
shacks alongside roads or stagnant drainage canals that simultane-
ously became drinking water supplies and sewage systems.
 
Maladies such as hookworm, pellagra, and rickets were common 
in the camps. In one season in just one county, 50 babies died of 
dysentery and enteritis. “Even in mid-day, the interior of the shack 
is dark,” reported a social worker touring a migrant labor camp. 
“The noxious odors are strong with dampness, rot, stale atmosphere. 
Some shacks contain nothing but a bedroll.”
As excited as they may have been about California’s higher wages, 
the migrants soon found out the higher pay couldn’t compensate 
for long stretches of unemployment. In 1938, the average migrant 
family was living on $650 a year, less than half the national family 
average of $1,500. The migrants found they had two choices: pack 
up the family and move to another camp, following the crops, or 
wait it out where they were. Most chose to wait it out, wanting to 
put down roots.
Feeling the sting of discrimination
The appalling living conditions weren’t the Cotton Belt migrants’ 
only problem. Many Valley residents regarded the newcomers as 
second-class citizens. The migrants were referred to disparagingly 
as Okies or Arkies and discriminated against just as other minorities 
were discriminated against. Some movie theaters had signs that 
directed “Okies and Negroes” to the balcony. Cafés posted placards 
reading “No dogs or Okies.”
A University of California anthropologist studying the social effects 
of the large-scale farming system reported that longtime residents 
thought of the newcomers as “ignorant and uneducated, dirty of 
habit if not of mind, slothful, unambitious and dependent . . . not 
rarely is he (the Southwesterner) accused of being dishonest.” The 
state’s leading farm journal accused the newcomers of being “clay” 
in the hands of communist agitators, of spreading disease, and of 
fostering “unmorality (sic) in the schools.”
The newcomers were also distrusted because of the roles they 
played — both real and exaggerated — in the series of bitter and 
sometimes violent farm strikes California suffered during the 
decade (more on those in Chapter 11).

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
140
 
While the claims of spreading disease and fostering “unmorality” 
were spurious, the Californians did have a legitimate beef about 
one thing: Taking care of the newcomers cost a lot of tax money. 
Between 1935 and 1940, taxes in five San Joaquin Valley counties 
doubled, while taxes in the rest of the state went up 50 percent. 
Much of that extra tax revenue went to pay for aid to the 
Southwesterners: Relief cases in the Valley went up 344 percent 
between 1937 and 1939, while they increased in the state as a 
whole by 77 percent.
In 1938, California business and agriculture leaders filed a petition 
with Congress, signed by 100,000 residents. The petition asked the 
federal government to lure the migrants back to their home states 
by promising them relief payments there, and by threatening to 
cut off relief if they stayed in California. “If they come to this state,” 
declared one California legislator, “let them starve or stay away.”
Putting down roots
But most of the Southwesterners stayed, despite state laws passed 
in 1939 and 1940 that increased the minimum residency to qualify 
for relief payments from one year to three years and then to five 
years.
 
“I would like to know who Californians think they are when they 
put themselves on a pedestal,” one defiant Oklahoma woman 
wrote to the Fresno Bee. “Oklahoma is a full-fledged state within 
these United States, and as this is a free country, we have every 
moral and legal right to be here.”
Toward the end of the decade, 13 federal migrant camps with 
showers, toilets, kitchen facilities, and communal halls were 
established in California, along with six mobile camps that could 
be moved as different crops reached harvest season.
Permanent settlements on the outskirts of Central Valley towns 
gradually replaced the tent camps. Dubbed “Little Oklahomas,” the 
communities featured lots that could be had for $125 ($10 down 
and $5 a month). It often took the owner several years to complete 
construction of a permanent dwelling, but it got done. A 1940 Time 
magazine story noted that in Salinas, California, “Little Oklahoma has 
become East Salinas,” with “new stucco or brightly painted five-room 
frame houses crowding out vestiges of the old tar-paper shacks.”
And as with so many aspects of the Great Depression, the great 
migration of Southwesterners to California would be overshadowed 
by the oncoming world war. The war brought tens of thousands of 
new war production jobs to California and tens of thousands more 
newcomers. By 1945, the “Okies” were Californians.

 Chapter 8: On the Road 141
Lessons Learned
While the Civilian Conservation Corps lasted only nine years, its 
impact lasted far longer, and it has become the ancestor of programs 
that match young people and public service. Sadly, another lesson 
of the Great Depression — the need to improve the shoddy 
treatment of migrant farm workers — has yet to be fully learned. 
Here’s a look at two programs that could be said to be the children 
of the CCC, and a brief look at the status of migrant workers in 
21st-century America.
Working to serve
The concept of a volunteer organization to help developing nations 
had been kicking around Congress throughout the 1950s. But it 
became a reality after John F. Kennedy won the presidency and 
established the Peace Corps in 1961.
The Peace Corps is an independent federal agency. Foreign 
governments in developing countries ask for help in specific areas, 
such as teaching English, or engineering, agricultural, or business 
skills, and the Peace Corps sends volunteers. From 1961 through 
2008, the Peace Corps sent about 200,000 volunteers to 139 countries.
The volunteers, who in early 2009 were 60 percent female, 94 
percent unmarried, 94 percent college graduates, and an average of 
27 years old, sign up for stints that are usually 27 months but can 
last a maximum of five years. Volunteers are given allowances to 
cover the cost of living in the country to which they are assigned, 
a round-trip air ticket, medical and dental insurance, and a $6,075 
“transition award” when they return.
The domestic version of the Peace Corps is AmeriCorps. President 
Bill Clinton and Congress created this agency in 1993. There are 
three subdivisions of AmeriCorps:
 
✓ AmeriCorps State and National: This division provides grants 
to public agencies and nonprofit and religious groups, which 
use the money to recruit and train workers to help meet 
community education, environmental, health, and public 
safety needs.
 
✓ AmeriCorps VISTA (Volunteers In Service To America): 
VISTA was originally begun in 1965 and became part of 
AmeriCorps in 1993. It functions like AmeriCorps State and 
National, except that it focuses on problems in low-income 
communities.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
142
 
✓ AmeriCorps NCCC (National Civilian Community Corps): 
NCCC consists of teams of 10 to 12 members located at four 
centers around the United States. They essentially function 
as AmeriCorps’ emergency teams, responding to specific 
requests for help in the geographic region they cover.
AmeriCorps members receive living allowances during their 
one-year assignment and end-of-stint education grants that in 2009 
were $4,725.
Losing ground in the fields
As the United States got deeper into World War II and more men 
were called to military service, a shortage of farm labor developed. 
So in 1942, the U.S. and Mexican governments reached an agreement 
that allowed Mexican workers — called braceros — to enter the 
United States. Thousands of Mexicans, some of whom had been 
pushed out of the United States during the Great Depression, 
entered the country, most of them taking jobs in farm fields in the 
West and Southeast. Many of the jobs in the West had been held by 
the “Okies”: migrants from the southwestern United States in the 
1930s.
The bracero program ended in 1964, in part because advances in 
mechanized farming had reduced the need for workers, and in part 
because criticisms were leveled at both governments for the harsh 
treatment and brutal living conditions endured by the workers.
But hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, in the country 
both legally and illegally, continued to labor in the fields under 
deplorable situations. Landowners sometimes tried to insulate 
themselves from responsibility for the workers by hiring them 
through a farm labor contractor, who acted as a middleman.
In 1983, Congress passed the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural 
Workers Protection Act (MSPA). The act requires labor contractors 
to register with the U.S. Department of Labor and sets standards 
for pay, working conditions, transportation, and housing.
But abuses have continued. In 2008, a congressional committee 
heard testimony that pineros, migrant workers who labor in 
reforestation and clearing timber, were often ripped off by their 
employers or not equipped with safety gear. Another committee 
was told about tomato field workers in Florida who were beaten 
and kept in virtual slavery.

 Chapter 8: On the Road 143
A 2008 study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported there 
were about 1 million migrant farm workers in the United States, 
down from about 3 million in 1953. The study found that migrants 
were 10 times as likely as nonmigrants to have homes with no 
stove and 17 times as likely to live in overcrowded conditions. It 
found that, adjusted for inflation, farm worker hourly wages had 
risen 76 cents from 1975 to 2006, about 2 percent per year, to 
$9.87.
“While critical to many agricultural sectors,” the study concluded, 
“hired farm workers remain among the most economically dis-
advantaged working groups in the United States. This relative 
position within the U.S. occupational structure has changed little 
over time.”

M
any historians still marvel at how Americans kept their 
political cool during the Great Depression. After all, there 
was plenty to be confused and angry about. People in other 
countries, faced with similar situations, either embraced new 
dictators or continued to put up with old ones. But Americans 
embraced neither revolution nor rule by despots.
Because they didn’t embrace radical extremes, however, doesn’t 
mean Americans didn’t think about them. This chapter takes a look 
at some of the leading leader wannabes of the 1930s, as well as efforts 
to influence the political process from both the left and right of the 
ideological spectrum. It also examines how Americans who were 
frustrated and wanted to strike out at “the man” did so vicariously 
through the bloody exploits of the Great Depression outlaws.
The Soapbox Supermen
By the beginning of 1934, the Great Depression was more than four 
years old, and people were getting more than a little tired of it. The 
enthusiasm and optimism generated by the election of Franklin D. 
Roosevelt in November 1932 had largely worn off.
Lorena Hickok, one of a group of investigators sent out by the 
Roosevelt administration to take the pulse of the country, wrote 
back to Washington, D.C., in April 1934 that the country’s pulse 
was a bit feeble.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
146
 
“I’ve been out on this trip now a little more than two weeks,” 
Hickok wrote. “In all that time I’ve hardly met a single person who 
seemed confident and cheerful . . . nobody seems to think anymore 
that this thing is going to work.”
Hickok also noted that she was hearing more talk about the possible 
need for not only a new government, but a new kind of government. 
“If I were 20 years younger and weighed 75 pounds less,” she joked, 
“I think I’d start out to be the Joan of Arc of the Fascist movement 
in the United States.”
Despite Hickok’s gloomy analysis, Americans made it clear in 
the 1934 congressional elections that if they were growing rest-
less under Roosevelt, they didn’t think it was time to give the 
Republicans another chance. The GOP lost 14 seats in the House of 
Representatives and 10 in the Senate. Yet Roosevelt’s real political 
problems were to come not from Republicans but from an elderly 
doctor in California, a Roman Catholic priest in Michigan, and a 
bombastic U.S. senator from Louisiana. Here’s a look at the trio of 
trouble.
Francis E. Townsend
Francis Townsend said his idea came to him after watching two 
elderly women look for something to eat in garbage cans behind 
his Long Beach, California, home. Townsend was a 66-year-old 
physician/real estate salesman in the fall of 1933. His idea was to 
provide financial security for older people.
 
The Townsend plan, which he called the Old Age Revolving 
Pension Plan, was simple — and simplistic. Under it, everyone 
over the age of 60 would be guaranteed a pension of $200 a month, 
provided they spent the entire amount each month in order to 
stimulate the economy. The funds would come from a tax on all 
wholesale and retail sales. Economists pointed out that the plan 
would take half of the nation’s wealth to provide security for only 8 
percent of the population.
A lot of people ignored the economists. By 1935, 5,000 “Townsend 
Clubs” had sprung up around the country. By the beginning of 
1936, a staggering 20 million Americans — one-fifth of the entire 
adult population — had signed petitions urging congressional 
passage of his plan.

 Chapter 9: Demagogues and Desperadoes 147
Charles E. Coughlin
Charles Coughlin was a man of the cloth, but he may have been 
born for radio. His voice had such an entrancing quality, author 
Wallace Stegner wrote, “that anyone turning past it on the radio 
dial almost automatically returned to hear it again.”
Born in Canada in 1891, Coughlin was a Roman Catholic priest with 
a small parish in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak when he began 
a radio program in 1926. A staunch anti-communist and ardent 
nationalist, Coughlin’s program became so popular that by 1930, 
he was on 17 CBS-owned stations. It later became so controversial 
that by 1932, CBS dropped him.
 
Undeterred, Coughlin started his own network. His “Golden Hour 
of the Little Flower” show was soon broadcasting to an estimated 
audience of 30 million people each week over 60 stations, and 
raking in $20,000 a week in contributions. (In 2008, the audience of 
Rush Limbaugh, the nation’s most popular radio personality at 
the time, was estimated at about 14 million.) Coughlin reported 
getting 80,000 letters a week — more mail than FDR — and Fortune 
magazine dubbed him “just about the biggest thing that ever 
happened to radio.”
Coughlin was initially an ardent booster of Roosevelt, saying the 
country’s choice was “Roosevelt or Ruin” and that FDR’s package 
of proposals, dubbed the New Deal, was also “Christ’s Deal.” But 
the “radio priest” eventually differed sharply with the president 
over several issues. A virulent anti-Semite, Coughlin began referring to 
the New Deal as the “Jew Deal.” By the end of 1934, he had formed 
a quasi-political party called the National Union for Social Justice, 
which claimed 7.5 million members.
Huey P. Long
Huey Long was a one-time traveling shortening salesman whom 
Roosevelt regarded as “one of the two most dangerous men in 
America” (the other being Army Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur).
Long was born in a log cabin in 1893, the seventh of nine children. 
By the age of 21, he had finished law school, and after paying his 
dues in lower elective offices, he was elected governor of Louisiana 
in 1928. He was called “Da Kingfish” by his friends (after a popular 
radio character), and Long had a lot of friends. As governor, Long 
built hundreds of miles of new roads, eased taxes on the poor, 
imposed new taxes on oil companies and other businesses, and 
supplied textbooks and buses to the state’s schools.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
148
 
“I’m for the poor man,” he told reporters, “all poor men. Black and 
white, they all gotta have a chance. ‘Every man a king,’ that’s my 
motto.”
But Long was also a virtual dictator. Through coercion or bribery, 
he controlled almost every judge in the state, most of the legislators, 
and the police. Critics were beaten, kidnapped, jailed, or black-
mailed into silence. Long was so powerful that he had himself 
elected a Democratic U.S. senator from Louisiana while also 
holding on, for a time, to the governor’s office.
 
Like Coughlin, Long started out a Roosevelt supporter and turned 
into a leading Roosevelt basher. Like Townsend, Long had a 
grandiose plan for curing the country’s ills. Under his Share Our 
Wealth Plan, Long proposed to limit the amount of money an 
individual could have or could make in a single year. The money 
confiscated from those who had more than the limits (which 
varied from $1.5 million to $5 million in cumulative wealth and 
from $600,000 to $1.8 million in annual income) would be 
redistributed so that every American family would have $5,000 
worth of annual salaries and amenities like a car and a homestead.
Like Townsend’s plan, it was mathematically goofy. Economists 
pointed out that taking all the money from the rich and giving it to 
the poor would amount to about $400 per family, not $5,000. It was 
a fact lost on lots of people. Long developed a national following 
and became a force in Washington, D.C., as well as Louisiana.
Heading for a showdown with FDR
In May 1935, Long, Townsend, and Coughlin began talking about 
forming a third political party to run against Roosevelt in the 1936 
presidential election campaign, with Long as the candidate. “I’ll 
tell you here and now,” Long said in the summer of 1935, “FDR will 
not be the next president of the United States. If the Democrats 
nominate Roosevelt and the Republicans nominate (former 
President Herbert) Hoover, Huey Long will be your next president.”
Roosevelt was acutely aware of the threat from the troika of 
demagogues. “I am fighting communism, Huey Longism, Coughlinism, 
Townsendism,” FDR told a reporter. “I want to save our system” 
from “crackpot ideas.” Roosevelt also knew that Long didn’t 
actually think he could win in 1936 but would run to pull enough 
votes away from Roosevelt to keep the president from winning.

 Chapter 9: Demagogues and Desperadoes 149
 
“Long plans to be a candidate of the Hitler type,” FDR wrote in a 
letter to the U.S. ambassador to Germany. “He hopes to defeat the 
Democratic Party and put in a reactionary Republican. That would 
bring the country to such a state by 1940 that Long thinks he could 
be made dictator.”
But the best-laid plans of Long, Coughlin, and Townsend went awry 
on the evening of September 8, 1935. Coming out of a legislative 
session in the Louisiana Capitol, Long was shot by a man whose 
family reputation had been smeared by the senator. Long died two 
days later. (His bodyguards pumped 61 bullets into the assassin.)
Without a bonafide candidate, the hopes of Coughlin and 
Townsend were dashed, although they tried anyway. A North 
Dakota congressman named William “Liberty Bill” Lemke was 
recruited, and he ran on the Union Party ticket. Coughlin vowed to 
quit radio if Lemke didn’t get at least 9 million votes in the election.
As strange as it sounds now, the Roosevelt camp had reason for 
concern about the election, if not Lemke. Several polls predicted 
that the Republican candidate, Kansas Governor Alf Landon, would 
win easily. But the pollsters asked the wrong voters, neglecting to 
include people at the bottom of the economic ladder or African 
Americans, who traditionally had voted Republican but switched 
in huge numbers to FDR’s Democratic Party.
 
Roosevelt won a smashing victory, gathering 27.7 million votes to 
Landon’s 16.7 million and Lemke’s 880,000. FDR carried every state 
but Maine and Vermont. “I knew I should have gone to Maine and 
Vermont,” Roosevelt quipped after the returns were in.
Coughlin, who died in 1979, did not give up his radio show until 
1942, but he never again attained the popularity or influence he 
once had. Townsend, who was briefly jailed for refusing to testify 
before a congressional committee, faded from the public eye and 
died in 1960 at the age of 93. As their influence decreased, however, 
there remained considerable noise during the 1930s from the left 
and the right of the political spectrum.
Fascists, Nazis, and Reds
It’s a truism of American politics that Americans don’t mind radical 
change — as long as it’s done in moderation. The veracity of that 
idea, however, was sorely tested in the Great Depression. The 
desperate times had people thinking that maybe something 
desperate needed to be done.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
150
 
“Never before or since have I heard so much open and bitter 
cynicism about democracy and the American system,” said 
six-time Socialist presidential candidate Norman Thomas.
Some Americans thought the president should seize power. 
“What we need now is martial law,” magazine publisher Bernarr 
Macfadden told readers of Liberty Magazine. “This is no time for 
civil law. The president should have dictatorial powers . . . the 
Constitution should not interfere with the remedies which are 
essential to get us out of this appalling depression.”
Hatching the “Business Plot”
If a former Marine Corps major general was to be believed, at least 
one group of business leaders thought power should be seized 
from the president. In November 1934, retired Major General 
Smedley Butler told a congressional committee that a man named 
Gerald MacGuire had approached him in mid-1933. MacGuire was 
heir to the Singer Sewing machine fortune and one of Wall Street’s 
richest investors.
 
Butler said MacGuire wanted him to participate in a fascist coup of 
the government. The plan, according to Butler, was to install Butler 
in a cabinet-level post as “secretary of general affairs.” Roosevelt 
would remain as a puppet, but a group of business leaders would 
actually run things. Butler said he was promised an army of 
500,000 veterans and $30 million in financial backing.
MacGuire vehemently denied the whole thing, which came to be 
known as the “Business Plot,” and there was little corroborative 
evidence. Nonetheless, the committee concluded that “there is 
no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, 
and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial 
backers deemed it expedient.” But for reasons never made 
entirely clear, nothing came of the allegations or the committee’s 
investigation.
Defending the wealthy
Some of the folks suspected of being in back of the “Business Plot” 
put together an organization in August 1934 that they called the 
American Liberty League. The members included business giants 
such as DuPont, General Foods, General Motors, and Standard 
Oil, and politicians from both parties — including Al Smith, the 
1928 Democratic presidential candidate-turned-Roosevelt hater. 
The organization’s purpose was to “defend and uphold the 

 Chapter 9: Demagogues and Desperadoes 151
Constitution” and “foster the right to work, earn, save and acquire 
property.” Left unstated but obvious to everyone was that the 
League’s purpose was to defeat Roosevelt’s bid for a second term 
in 1936 and to portray the administration’s depression-fighting 
programs as at best socialist and at worst communist.
The wealthy had good reason to be nervous. In his annual message 
to Congress in January 1936, FDR called for “unceasing warfare” to 
be waged on “our resplendent economic autocracy.” The Liberty 
League hit back at a New York luncheon of 2,000 people later in the 
month — a gathering The New York Times called “the greatest 
collection of millionaires ever gathered under one roof.”
 
“The New Deal smells of the stench of Communistic Russia,” Smith 
told the crowd. “There can be only one Capitol, Washington or 
Moscow. There can be only one atmosphere of government, the 
clean fresh air of free America, or the foul breath of Communist 
Russia.”
Actually, that sort of rhetoric and the League’s opposition probably 
ended up helping Roosevelt, because the enemy of the rich had to 
be the friend of the poor — and there were a lot more poor people 
than rich people during the Great Depression.
Trying to get a footing 
as communists
While Roosevelt’s enemies were trying unsuccessfully to paint 
his administration with a communist brush, the real communists 
were struggling mightily to establish themselves in Depression-era 
America.
 
Under a Soviet strategy called “the Popular Front,” American com-
munists tried to enhance their image as ordinary Americans who 
just happened to believe the government model the United States 
should follow was that of the Soviet Union. They joined churches 
and formed book clubs, dining clubs, and theater groups. They 
ingratiated themselves with Hollywood celebrities by sponsoring 
anti-Nazi or pro-Spanish Republic groups. The communist newspaper 
The Daily Worker even began running a large sports section.
But outside of a few intellectuals and a few labor unions, the 
communists made no significant inroads during the 1930s. And 
after Soviet leader Joseph Stalin signed an alliance with Germany’s 
Adolf Hitler in August 1939 (just before Germany invaded Poland 
and started World War II), the communists lost what little credibility 
they may have had.

Shilling for Der Führer
Another group trying to make a mark in Depression-era America 
came from the right. After Hitler rose to power in Germany in 1933, 
some Germans and German-Americans formed groups to support 
the new German leader and his National Socialist, or Nazi, Party.
The first of these groups called itself the “Friends of New Germany” 
and had the blessing of Hitler’s government. The group, which 
never grew larger than 5,000 to 10,000 members, mainly held rallies 
to rhetorically rough up communists and Jews, and soon was more 
of an embarrassment to Germany than an asset. In October 1935, 
German Nazi officials ordered the organization to disband.
In less than a year, another group sprung up, calling itself the 
“German-American Bund” (meaning “organization”). A fellow 
named Fritz Kuhn, who had fought for Germany in World War I but 
had become a naturalized U.S. citizen, headed the group. Kuhn’s 
group held rallies, set up recreational camps for youths and families, 
and simultaneously extolled the joys of Hitler’s Germany and the 
“evil conspiracies” being concocted by Jews.
The Bund began attracting the attention of U.S. federal agents 
when reports surfaced that Kuhn had a force of 200,000 men ready 
to take up arms. In reality, the group never had more than perhaps 
7,500 members, and Kuhn was a first-class chowderhead. Hitler’s 
government was so unimpressed that it ordered the group to stop 
displaying Nazi symbols or emblems, and the German ambassador to 
the United States referred to Kuhn as “stupid, noisy and absurd.”
The Bund held its largest rally at New York’s Madison Square 
Garden in February 1939. The rally attracted a crowd of about 
22,000. But after the rally, Kuhn was arrested for embezzling 
money from his group. After the Japanese attack on the U.S. Naval 
base at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Bund was formally 
dissolved and some of its other officers were arrested for 
attempting to avoid the draft or engaging in subversive activities.
Sticking with the Constitution
In the end, none of the extremist efforts made much headway with 
Americans, despite the anger, fear, and uncertainty generated by 
the Great Depression.

 Chapter 9: Demagogues and Desperadoes 153
That fact was underscored by two surveys conducted by pollster 
Elmer Roper in late 1939 for Fortune magazine. The surveys found 
that 67 percent believed it was government’s responsibility to 
provide for people in need, while less than 10 percent believed it 
was time to change the entire U.S. Constitution.
Most importantly, almost two-thirds believed “the future holds 
opportunity for advancement,” and 76 percent believed their 
children faced a better future than their own.
Robin Hoods and Dirty Rats
The 1930s saw the resurrection of an American archetype: the 
outlaw. Instead of the 19th-century six-guns, horses, and “head ’em 
off at the pass” motif, the Great Depression version was machine 
guns, Fords, and “come and get me coppers!”
Although violent crime rates actually decreased during the decade 
(compared with the previous decade), bank robberies, kidnappings, 
daring jailbreaks, and desperate shootouts between cops and 
killers became front-page news on an almost daily basis. Perhaps 
people wanted to hit back at whoever had caused the Great 
Depression, and they got a vicarious kick out of the brash behavior 
of criminals.
 
Whatever the reason for the public’s fascination with bad guys and 
bad girls, it was certainly aided and abetted by the mass media. 
Hollywood studios quickly figured out that gangster films were 
the single most popular genre among moviegoers. The studios 
churned out 50 such movies in 1931 alone.
In the early years of the Great Depression, criminals were often 
depicted as tragic figures that went bad because of a tough break 
somewhere along the line. They were also often portrayed as 
committing crimes against even more insidious criminals, such as 
corrupt politicians, bankers, or businessmen (which a lot of people 
may have wanted to do themselves).
In a 1932 piece about actor James Cagney’s role as a gangster in 
Public Enemy, New York essayist Lincoln Kirstein wrote that “when 
Cagney gets down off a truck, or deals at cards, or curses, or slaps 
his girl . . . he is, for the time, being the American hero, whom 
ordinary men and boys recognize as themselves.”

Newspapers sensationalized crooks by giving or playing up catchy 
nicknames such as George “Baby Face” Nelson, Arthur “Pretty 
Boy” Floyd, George “Machine Gun” Kelly, and Alvin “Creepy” 
Karpis. They installed various criminals as the nation’s “Public 
Enemy No. 1,” even though there was no such official list.
And there was no such thing as too much crime news. For example, 
the day after bad guy John Dillinger (whose wanted poster can 
be seen in Figure 9-1) was gunned down outside a Chicago movie 
theater (where he had been watching — what else? — a gangster 
movie), the Fresno Bee carried five front-page stories on crime. 
Three were related to Dillinger, one described a Texas prison 
break by pals of Clyde Barrow (of Bonnie and Clyde), and another 
told of the manhunt for Baby Face Nelson.
Figure 9-1: A 1934 FBI wanted poster for 
John Dillinger, offering a reward of $10,000 
for his capture.
The papers — and other media — also shamelessly played up the 
Robin Hood angle. The papers reported how Bonnie and Clyde 
sometimes burned mortgage notes when they robbed a bank. 
The iconic 1930s troubadour Woody Guthrie wrote a song about 
Pretty Boy Floyd that included the lyrics: “There’s many a starving 
farmer/The same old story told/ How the outlaw paid their mortgage/
and saved their little home.”

 Chapter 9: Demagogues and Desperadoes 155
A popular tale was how bad man Dillinger (see the sidebar on him 
later in the chapter) once asked a farmer during a bank robbery if 
the $50 in the farmer’s hand was his or the bank’s. When the fellow 
said it was his, according to the story, Dillinger told him to keep it. 
“He robs those who became rich robbing poor people,” an admirer 
wrote to an Indianapolis newspaper. “I am for Johnnie.”
Thirsting for justice
However much Americans liked reading about or watching 
criminals on the silver screen, however, most people didn’t really 
like the idea of criminals going unpunished. Seemingly everyone 
had a cure for a crime wave that, according to statistics, didn’t 
really exist. The cures ranged from public hangings to reinstating 
whipping as a punishment to establishing a “Devil’s Island” prison 
for hard-core bad guys (which actually came about in 1933 when 
San Francisco Bay’s Alcatraz Island became a federal prison).
New York passed a law that made it a crime to be someone “who 
bears an evil reputation” and “consorts with thieves and criminals 
or frequents unlawful resorts.” Most cases under the law were 
thrown out as unconstitutionally vague. But that didn’t stop the 
New York commissioner of corrections, Walter N. Thayer, from 
calling for a National Public Enemies Act that would allow the 
jailing of any “individual with a known record who consorts with 
known criminals and has no visible means of support.”
 
“Any city can be cleared of known criminals in 48 hours,” Thayer 
asserted, “if the hands of the police are unshackled and if the 
powers that be will assure them of backing and support.”
But the powers that be wouldn’t assure them of federal backing and 
support, at least not while Herbert Hoover was president. Hoover 
balked at more federal involvement in fighting crime because it 
would cost money and intrude on state’s rights. In a 1930 speech, 
Hoover said, “Every state has ample laws . . . what is needed is the 
enforcement of those laws, and not new laws. Any suggestion of 
increasing federal criminal laws in general is a (bad) reflection on 
the sovereignty and the standing of state government.”
Left unsaid by Hoover, at least publicly, was that he had little faith 
in the federal Division of Investigation (which formally became the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935). Federal investigators were 
not allowed to carry firearms, could not make arrests, and had 
such a reputation for corruption that they were sneeringly referred 
to as “the Department of Easy Virtue.”

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
156
 
After Roosevelt replaced Hoover in the White House in 1933, 
however, the federal government took a new approach. In April 
1934, Attorney General Homer Cummings announced a 12-bill 
crime-fighting package that included making federal crimes of 
bank robbery, interstate flight to avoid prosecutions, and 
transporting stolen goods. These statutes would thwart criminals 
who committed a robbery in one state and then fled to another 
state where they had committed no crime. The bill also allowed 
federal agents to carry weapons and make arrests, and it outlawed 
machine guns. The laws finally gave FBI director John Edgar 
Hoover the tools he had been waiting for since he took over the 
bureau in 1924.
In signing the package on May 18, 1934, Roosevelt issued a bit of 
a scolding to the media and the public: “Law enforcement and 
gangster extermination cannot be completely effective so long as 
a substantial part of the public looks with tolerance upon known 
criminals . . . or applauds efforts to romanticize crime.”
Emphasizing the good guys
Hollywood heeded Roosevelt’s advice to quit glamorizing the bad 
guys. In true Hollywood fashion, in fact, it went overboard. The 
Motion Picture Producers Association prohibited its members 
from making films about John Dillinger, stating that the decision 
was ”based on a belief . . . that such a picture could be detrimental 
to the best public interests.”
 
A new censorship code, established at the end of 1934, effectively 
banned gangster movies by prohibiting a long list of things from 
being shown on the screen. Those included giving the lead role 
to a bad-guy character; showing cops being killed; depicting the 
crimes of arson, kidnapping, or revenge murders; “flaunting 
firearms”; displaying machine guns or other illegal weapons; 
and ending the movie without the bad guy being killed or sent to 
prison.
Stripped of their most popular genre, some enterprising filmmakers 
got around the ban by making pictures about the good guys — 
specifically the FBI. Eight such movies were made in 1935. The 
most successful was called ‘G’ Men, a nickname for federal agents, 
or “government men.” The film starred James Cagney, who played 
a young agent in pretty much the same way he played a young 
criminal four years earlier in Public Enemy.
The FBI officially kept all the Hollywood adulation at arm’s length 
in order to head off charges that it had encouraged the films. But 
the bureau’s director, J. Edgar Hoover, ate it up. Hoover, who 

 Chapter 9: Demagogues and Desperadoes 157
looked and often acted like a dyspeptic owl, had a flair for public-
ity and an intense sense of duty. He played up the seriousness of 
crime in the period by collecting often inflated and at best unre-
liable crime statistics from local jurisdictions. “The criminal in 
America is on the march,” he solemnly warned in 1934.
As law enforcement hunted down and killed or captured the most 
high-profile criminals, Hoover made sure the bureau received ample 
credit, no matter what its real role had been. As FBI director until his 
death in 1972, Hoover would become one of the most powerful 
Americans of the 20th century. He would often use his powers 
unethically and possibly illegally. But in the 1930s, he was a hero.
“Pick a small boy these days and ask him who of all the people 
in the world he wants to be like,” the New York World-Telegram 
reported in 1936, “and ten to one he will reply ‘J. Edgar Hoover.’”
John Dillinger
“John Dillinger, ace bad man of the world, got his last night — two slugs through his 
heart and one through his head. He was tough and he was shrewd, but he wasn’t as 
tough or as shrewd as the federals, who never close a case until the end.”
Thus began the July 23, 1934, International News Service story that capped the 
criminal career of the 1930s’ number-one “public enemy.” Born in 1903, Dillinger got 
his start in crime by robbing a grocery store in 1924. His lack of experience showed, 
and he was quickly caught and served nine years in prison.
Dillinger made up for lost time when he was released in 1933 by beginning a 
14-month crime spree that saw him kill ten men, engineer three jail breaks (once 
with a “gun” carved from a bar of soap), escape from two gun battles with police, 
and grab more than $265,000 ($4.4 million in 2008 dollars) from various banks.
Dillinger became a folk hero, vaulting athletically over bank counters and seeming 
never to lose his cool. After being captured in January 1934, Dillinger posed for pic-
tures with law enforcement officials and then promptly escaped from an “escape-
proof” jail — in the sheriff’s new car. During the break, he took two hostages, and 
when he released them, Dillinger gave them each $4 for their troubles.
His demise came when a mysterious “woman in red” told FBI agents he would be 
attending a movie at a Chicago theater. Two dozen agents and police ambushed 
him as he left the theater and gunned him down. Or, as another newspaper story 
put it the next day:
“A stiffening corpse in the county morgue and a muddied pool of blood in the filth of 
an alley was all that was left today of John Dillinger, arch criminal of modern times. 
Dillinger died as he had lived — in a hail of bullets and a welter of blood.”

Lessons Learned
The correlation between hard economic times and increased crime 
rates would seem to be a no-brainer. But as the experiences of the 
Great Depression show, that’s not necessarily so.
Almost every recessionary period in the United States since the 
1950s has been accompanied by a rise in crime rates, particularly 
property crimes such as robbery and burglary. The factors that 
contribute to the increases include
 
✓ The obvious effects of falling wages and greater unemployment 
rates creating a bigger pool of people that may be driven to 
commit a crime.
 
✓ Greater use of alcohol and drugs as an escape, which could 
lead to lowered inhibitions to commit a crime, or make 
economic situations more desperate.
 
✓ More vacant stores and houses, which can invite more crime 
since there may be fewer potential witnesses.
 
✓ Smaller police budgets that translate to less law enforcement.
But in the Great Depression of the 1930s, crime rates went up in 
the first part of the decade and then steadily declined through the 
rest. Sociologists and criminologists theorize that the rise in crime 
during the first two or three years was due to a combination of two 
things. One was the onset of hard economic times.
The other, and more important, factor was Prohibition: the 
nationwide ban on liquor sales that spurred a massive illegal black 
market and sparked widespread violence as various criminal 
organizations vied for control of the trade. When Prohibition 
ended in 1933, crime rates began dropping even though hard times 
continued.
But researchers have suggested that another factor besides the 
end of Prohibition may have contributed to the drop: the creation 
of programs that put people to work (such as the Work Progress 
Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps) and social 
safety net services.
A 2007 study by economists from the University of California, 
Brigham Young University, and the University of Arizona con-
cluded that “relief spending during the 1930s lowered property 
crime in a statistically and economically significant way.”
Put another way, if you give people money, or a way to earn it, 
they are less likely to steal it.

W
hile the tentacles of the stagnant national economy 
touched all but the wealthiest Americans during the 1930s, 
that didn’t mean the sun never shone and everyone moped around 
waiting for World War II to start and get things moving again. The 
economic conditions meant less work, but that also meant more 
leisure time.
This chapter covers what people did with that leisure time, from 
listening to a lot of radio to going to lots of movies. It covers the 
heyday of comic strips and their offspring, as well as how people 
entertained their ears. I take a look at the return of legal drinking 
with the end of Prohibition in late 1933, and the chapter concludes 
with the pastime of driving around the country.
More Time to Play
In 1936, a federal committee formed by President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt to study the country’s resources reported that in the 
previous year, Americans had spent $17 billion on food, $9.5 billion 
on housing, $5.25 billion on clothing, $3.8 billion on automobiles, 
and $1.6 billion on recreation.
That last figure on recreation spending may seem surprisingly 
high, given that people were still in the midst of the most pro-
longed economic calamity in U.S. history. But people had more 
time on their hands for recreation — and recreation spending — 
precisely because the economy was sailing stormy seas.

Cutting down the workweek
Prior to the Great Depression, a typical U.S. workweek generally 
included at least a half-day’s work on Saturday, and very often a 
full day. That meant there were no such things as weekends, at 
least not in the modern sense of the term.
 
But when hard times hit, many companies reduced their hours of 
operation or split jobs among workers so that fewer would have to 
be laid off. In 1933, the Roosevelt administration urged employers 
to adopt a maximum 40-hours-per-person workweek as part of the 
National Industrial Recovery Act’s efforts to create more jobs.
By the time the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the act as 
unconstitutional in 1935 (see Chapter 13 for details), the five-day 
workweek had become a well-established fact for many businesses 
and industries. (In 1938, Congress approved the Fair Labor 
Standards Act, which mandated a 40-hour-maximum workweek. 
The act took effect in 1940.) And fewer hours working meant more 
leisure time for millions of Americans.
Finding uses for free time
Because most people were watching every dime, they often looked 
for things to do at home, whether it was hobbies such as gardening 
or playing games such as contract bridge. (Both activities were 
very big in the 1930s.) Other pastimes, like bowling or miniature 
golf (also big in the decade), cost a little money.
 
But whether they were free or for a fee, there seemed to be no 
shortage of things to do, even with a depression going on. In 1935, for 
example, the new things to do included seeing the first feature-length 
Technicolor movie (Becky Sharp), playing a new board game called 
Monopoly, attending a Major League Baseball game at night (at least 
in Cincinnati), and drinking beer out of a can. And if you were of a 
mind to just stay home and relax, there was always the radio.
When Radio Was King
With the exception of the automobile, probably nothing had a 
greater impact on American life in the first half of the 20th century 
than radio. Born in the early 1920s, the medium grew up in the 
Great Depression and became a member of most American 
families — especially when radios got cheaper. Manufacturers 
began encasing radios in plastic shells rather than wood, and they 
rewired the sets so they didn’t require large transformers. Those 
changes made them lighter and less expensive.

 Chapter 10: Having Fun in Spite of It All 161
 
In 1930, half of U.S. households had radios. By the middle of the 
decade, that number was up to 60 percent of households, which 
was twice as many as had telephones. By 1939, 86 percent of 
households had radios, as did 20 percent of motor vehicles, and 
Americans were listening to the radio an average of 4.5 hours 
a day.
A survey by the National Recreation Association in 1937 found that 
Americans’ favorite pastime was listening to the radio, and social 
workers reported radios were often the last possession destitute 
people would part with when selling off their household items.
What Americans listened to varied. There were comedy shows, 
often hosted by comics who had made the leap to radio from 
vaudeville or the movies. There were vivid dramas, which in at 
least one case proved too vivid. That was in October 1938, when 
Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre presented a version of The 
War of the Worlds that was so realistic it caused a panic among 
thousands of people who thought Earth had been invaded by 
Martians.
 
“You know, Orson,” President Roosevelt told Welles a few days 
after the broadcast, “you and I are the two best actors in America.”
People also could listen to real-life drama as it unfolded, such as 
the farewell address of the terminally ill baseball star Lou Gehrig, 
the abdication of the British throne by King Edward VIII so he 
could marry an American divorcee, and the German invasion of 
Poland.
Influencing America on 
the public airwaves
Radio exerted enormous influence on the country, turning 
America, as a 1933 study put it, “into a vast auditorium, into all 
corners of which a single voice can carry with dramatic ease and 
clarity.” Radio gave people a commonality of experience that 
jumped across family and neighborhood and even regional 
boundaries. It sold people things and told people things, and 
much of what was said over the airwaves was believed.
 
“When (people) say ‘the radio,’ they don’t mean a cabinet, an 
electric phenomenon, or a man in a studio,” wrote essayist E.B. 
White. “They refer to a pervading and somewhat godlike presence, 
which has come into their lives and homes.”

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
162
All this influence was being exerted over public property. In 1927, 
Congress declared that the airwaves belonged to the public and 
that the federal government had the responsibility to regulate 
who could broadcast and on what frequency. In 1934, the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) replaced what had been 
called the Federal Radio Commission and became the country’s 
supervising agency for nonprint mass media.
In the 1930s, the radio segment of the U.S. mass media was 
basically four major networks with which three-fourths of the 
country’s 600 to 800 radio stations were affiliated. The presence of 
four coast-to-coast networks (the Columbia Broadcasting Service, 
the Mutual Radio Network, and two controlled by the National 
Broadcasting Company, NBC “Red” and NBC “Blue”) gave 
U.S. businesses national avenues on which to advertise — and 
they jumped at the opportunity.
Between 1928 and 1934, radio advertising increased 316 percent, 
even as newspaper ads were dropping 30 percent and magazine 
ads 45 percent. By 1938, according to an FCC survey, one-third of 
radio time was devoted to commercials; one-third to music; and 
the rest to news, sports, religious shows, talk shows, comedies, 
and dramas — many of which were aimed at women and called 
“soap operas” because their sponsors often sold cleaning products.
 
Most shows had a single sponsor, and the show’s star often was 
the product’s primary pitchman. That situation resulted in products 
and characters or celebrities sometimes becoming fixed together 
in the public’s mind, such as Ovaltine drink mix with Little Orphan 
Annie, Pepsodent toothpaste with “Amos ’n Andy,” and Jell-O 
dessert mix with Jack Benny.
Radio ads were generally short and snappy, often with clever 
and annoyingly hard-to-forget jingles, and sometimes they made 
audaciously ludicrous claims:
 
✓ Cigarettes could ease digestion.
 
✓ Business careers could be ruined by not shaving closely 
enough.
 
✓ Mouthwashes could kill “up to 86.7 percent of germs” (though 
apparently never more than that).
Many ads also featured tie-ins, in which listeners were invited to 
write in for free samples or other “gifts.” That allowed advertisers 
to measure how well their message was getting across.

 Chapter 10: Having Fun in Spite of It All 163
Politicking over the air
Early on, politicians figured out the potential of radio to influence 
the public. In 1928, 20 percent of the Republican Party’s presidential 
campaign budget was for radio ads — the party’s single largest 
expense. In 1932, the GOP bought 42.5 hours of airtime for political 
messages and speeches, while the Democratic Party bought 51.5 
hours.
 
In 1936, Republicans set aside $1 million for radio advertising, and 
an adviser wrote to GOP presidential candidate Alf Landon that 
“the handling of Republican publicity should be on the same basis 
as the handling of any other article that wants to be merchandised 
to the public.” (It didn’t help much; Landon was crushed by 
Roosevelt.)
Political parties weren’t the only ones to recognize the potential 
and power of radio. Individuals such as Father Charles Coughlin 
and Louisiana politician Huey Long (covered in Chapter 9) used 
the radio as a pulpit from which to bash their opponents and 
extol the magnificence of their own ideas. But the most successful 
exponent of political persuasion over the radio was Franklin D. 
Roosevelt.
 
On Sunday, March 12, 1933 — eight days after taking over the 
Office of the President — Roosevelt sat before the fireplace in the 
Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House and addressed the 
nation over all of the radio networks.
It was the first of what would be 30 “fireside chats” during his 
12-plus years as president. (The “fireside chats” name was suggested 
by a radio executive.) In all of them, FDR would speak as though 
he were just talking with neighbors over coffee and pie, never 
patronizing his audience even when explaining complex issues.
 
As humorist Will Rogers put it after the first fireside chat on the 
country’s banking problems: “Our president took such a dry 
subject as banking (and) made everybody understand it — even 
the bankers.”
The chats were also an important political tool for Roosevelt. They 
allowed him to put his agenda before the country without filters, 
which was particularly helpful because most of the country’s major 
newspapers and newspaper chains opposed both the president and 
the New Deal and routinely editorialized against them.

Trading Real Life for Reel Life
If radio had a rival in the Great Depression, it was movies. Radio 
had the advantages of being free and readily accessible. But 
movies offered pictures to go along with the sound. And the 
darkened environment of the theater afforded customers at least 
the façade of anonymity and a place for many people to dream of 
other lives.
 
“Each day, millions of men, women and children sit in the 
windowless temples of the screen to commune with their 
vicarious friends and lovers,” observed writer Leo Rosten.
“Shhhhh! ‘Amos ’n Andy’ is on!”
Nowhere was radio’s influence more evident during the Great Depression than 
from 7:00 to 7:15 (EST) every evening except Sunday. Movie theaters would stop 
their films and pipe in the NBC Red network; department stores would crank up 
their radios; the number of phone calls around the country would drop by 50 per-
cent. And millions of Americans — including President Roosevelt — would drop 
whatever they were doing and listen to two white actors pretend to be two persis-
tently optimistic black men who ran a one-cab taxi company and repeatedly failed 
at get-rich-quick schemes.
At its peak in the mid-1930s, “Amos ’n Andy” drew an audience estimated at 40 
million — about one-third of all Americans. It was the equivalent of a Super Bowl 
TV audience, only it tuned in six nights a week, week in and week out. The show 
was so popular that the network eventually began rebroadcasting each segment at 
11:30 p.m. (EST) so people on the West Coast could hear it in prime time.
”Amos ’n Andy” was far more than a radio show. It made people smile during a 
period where there wasn’t a lot to smile about, and it served as a unifying force by 
giving perfect strangers something in common to discuss. Its impact was reflected 
in a comment by the noted British playwright George Bernard Shaw during a 1933 
tour of the United States. “There are three things which I shall never forget about 
America,” Shaw said, “Niagara Falls, the Rocky Mountains, and ‘Amos ’n Andy.’”
Not everyone was smitten by the show. The Pittsburgh Courier, the country’s most 
influential African American newspaper, gathered 740,000 signatures on a petition 
to have “Amos ’n Andy” pulled off the air for what the petition said were offensive 
racial stereotyping and propagation of racist attitudes toward African Americans. 
But the protests fell on deaf ears. “Amos ’n Andy” continued in various forms on 
the radio until 1960.

The relative newness of talking pictures (movies with sound, which 
debuted in late 1927) helped the movie industry keep the Great 
Depression at bay for a short time. But by 1933, ticket sales had 
slumped from 80 million a week in 1930 to 60 million. The cumulative 
value of stock of the five major studios — RKO, Paramount, Warner 
Brothers, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and 20th Century Fox — fell from 
about $1 billion in 1929 to less than $200 million in 1933.
Filling the seats
 
To combat declining ticket sales, theater owners cut their prices 
from 50 cents to 25 cents for adults and 10 cents for kids. (That’s 
$3.93 and $1.57 in 2008 dollars.) Owners also looked for extras 
they could add to their product. The extras included cartoons, 
abbreviated films called shorts, newsreels, or a combination of 
these. Gradually, the double feature became standard. It usually 
teamed an “A” picture with recognizable stars and big production 
values with a “B” picture featuring secondary actors and bargain-
basement production values.
Theater managers also added nonscreen extras. Popcorn, candy, 
and soda, once thought to be a nuisance because of the cleanup 
involved, became theater necessities when owners realized they 
could make more off food concessions than off admission tickets.
 
In the winter of 1932–33, a Colorado theater manager came up with 
something he called “Bank Nights” to stimulate attendance on the 
slowest nights at the box office, usually Mondays and Tuesdays. 
Patrons wrote their names in a book in the lobby, alongside a 
number. Tickets with corresponding numbers were put in drum, 
a ticket was drawn at intermission, and some lucky patron won a 
cash prize, usually around $150 (about $2,400 in 2008 dollars).
Variations on the game featured prizes that ranged from china to 
livestock. By the end of 1937, it was estimated that 5,000 theaters 
were hosting weekly promotions like Bank Night, giving away 
prizes totaling $1 million.
The extra screen features, the snacks, and the promotions, 
combined with films that were generally better made than those 
of an earlier decade, got people going to the movies again, as 
reflected in the Figure 10-1 photo.
By 1938, the average family spent $25 a year on movie admissions, 
and there were 1,700 movie theaters at which to spend it. That was 
double the number of hotels in the country and triple the number 
of department stores.

Free Soul.
 
Weekly movie ticket sales reached 86.5 million by the end of the 
1930s. That was the equivalent of two-thirds of the country going 
to the movies every week. In contrast, combined ticket sales for the 
United States and Canada in 2007 equaled about 26.9 million tickets 
a week, the equivalent of less than 8 percent of the two countries’ 
populations going to a weekly movie.
Keeping it clean
Sensitive to criticism in the early 1930s that it was portraying 
too much sex and violence on the screen, Hollywood voluntarily 
began to censor itself, particularly when it came to sex. In 1934, 
the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America began 
requiring films to have a “certificate of approval” from an industry-
created censorship board that had been created in 1930.
The board established a fairly rigid code of do’s and don’ts:
 
✓ Married couples had to have twin beds.
 
✓ Gangsters couldn’t be shown living the high life, even if they 
were gunned down later on.
 
✓ Words such as sex, God, and hell were forbidden.

(Producer David O. Selznick had to get special permission so that 
Clark Gable could utter the famous line “Frankly, my dear, I don’t 
give a damn” at the end of Gone with the Wind.)
Producing the stuff of dreams
Film historians and movie buffs often refer to the 1930s as 
“Hollywood’s Golden Age.” It was certainly one of the film industry’s 
most prolific periods. As many as 5,000 films were made during 
the decade, spurring one critic to call it “Fairyland on a production 
line.”
The quantity of films produced assured there would be a wide 
variety of genres. Gangster films were an early favorite in the 
decade (see Chapter 9). Lavish musicals, such as 42nd Street and 
Footlight Parade, brought sparkle to the screen, even if they were 
black and white. There were film biographies (The Story of Louis 
Pasteur, Voltaire), horror films (Dracula, Frankenstein, and King 
Kong), and adventure flicks (Robin Hood, The Lives of a Bengal 
Lancer). And late in the decade, there were epic Technicolor films 
like Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz.
Not everyone was enamored with the influence of movies on the 
American public during the period. In a 1936 Harper’s Magazine 
article, critic Ruth Suckow complained that films too often sugar-
coated life and resulted in too much hero worship of actors. 
“(Movies) have come to represent certain national ideals, reduced 
to the lowest common denominator,” she wrote. “For that is what 
the screen does — it reduces while it magnifies, grinds down what 
it exalts into the typical.”
But others have contended that movies during the period gave 
people not only an avenue of escape but also feelings of hope.
 
“American movie audiences, escaping from the realities of the 
Depression outside the movie theater, withdrew inside to see 
human grit triumph over suffering and human kindness triumph 
over financial, political and moral chicanery,” wrote film historian 
Gerald Mast. “If the optimism of Hollywood films provided the 
audiences with the tranquilizer it needed, it also strengthened the 
audience’s belief that eventually good people would make bad 
times better.”
That optimism was reflected in a 1933 film song that became 
something of an anthem for Americans, not only when facing 
the grimness of the Great Depression but also in the succeeding 
decade when facing totalitarian countries in World War II. The 
song was “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?” from Walt Disney’s 
The Three Little Pigs.

More Fun for the Eyes and Ears
While radio and movies dominated the leisure time of most 
Americans during the Great Depression, they were by no means the 
only pastimes to occupy the senses. Light reading, of things such 
as comics, comic books, and magazines, was also popular. And 
Americans found other ways to listen to music besides on the radio.
Reading comic strips 
and their offspring
Comic strips had been a part of U.S. newspapers since the late 
19th century, but they really came into their own in the late 1920s 
and early 1930s. Unlike their 21st-century counterparts, one comic 
strip could take up an entire page of a Sunday comics section, and the 
story lines tended to be more drawn out and convoluted. Newspapers 
were happy to provide the space because the strips were consistently 
at or near the top of best-read features in subscriber surveys.
 
Modern comic readers would find many familiar names in the 
comic strips that populated newspapers of the 1930s, such as 
Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Dick Tracy, Tarzan, Blondie, and 
Little Orphan Annie. A few less familiar figures emerged in that 
period as well: Flash Gordon, Secret Agent X-9, Buck Rogers, L’il 
Abner, Mandrake the Magician, and Terry and the Pirates.
Comic strips had the same appeal during the Great Depression as 
radio, movies, and other leisure-time activities, serving as respites 
from reality for adults and opening new worlds of imagination for 
children.
Critics took a less kindly view. In a 1937 article in the Saturday 
Review, Lowell Thompson complained that comics were too 
violent and full of cruel humor. “A tolerant contempt for the average 
man,” he wrote, “has ousted a spread-eagle faith in democracy.”
But Thompson was decidedly in the minority. Comics were so 
popular that they often spun off into other media, such as radio 
shows, feature films, and movie serials. A kid could listen to Flash 
Gordon on the radio Saturday morning, watch him at the movies 
Saturday afternoon, and read about him in the Sunday comics.

 Chapter 10: Having Fun in Spite of It All 169
 
The comics also spawned new forms of reading material during 
the period. There were comic books, the first modern version of 
which was born in 1933. Called Famous Funnies, it was a collection 
of comic strip reprints that was given away as a promotion by a 
cleaning products company.
The comic strips also gave birth to Big Little Books. These were 
squat cubes of cardboard and paper, measuring about 4 inches by 
4 inches and containing several hundred pages of big print and 
pictures. They were designed for kids and included most of the 
major comic strip characters, as well as adventure stories.
A slightly more sophisticated version of the comic book was the 
pulp magazine, so called because of the cheap wood pulp paper on 
which it was printed. The pulps featured fewer pictures and more 
words than comic books and usually focused on a specific genre, 
such as Westerns, detective stories, or horror. And they sometimes 
featured writers who were destined for greatness in other literary 
forms, such as playwright Tennessee Williams and novelist Sinclair 
Lewis.
Leapin’ lizards!
In 1924, a cartoonist name Harold Gray created a comic strip featuring the adven-
tures of a small girl named Little Orphan Annie. The redheaded kid had a dog named 
Sandy, a favorite saying (“Leapin’ lizards”), and eventually a foster father named 
Oliver “Daddy” Warbucks.
The strip was fabulously successful (it was reported to be President Herbert 
Hoover’s favorite). By 1934, Gray was reportedly making $100,000 a year from the 
strip and another $50,000-plus from a radio show featuring the characters.
At first aimed at children as a humorous strip, and then at older audiences as an 
adventure comic, “Annie” also served as a vehicle for Gray’s conservative/libertar-
ian political views. “Daddy” Warbucks was an unabashed champion of capitalism 
and a powerful tycoon who was not above meting out justice on bad guys without 
all the trouble of a court trial.
Gray hated President Roosevelt and Roosevelt’s New Deal policies. How much? 
In 1944, despondent at FDR having won a fourth presidential term, Gray killed off 
Daddy Warbucks with a mysterious disease, implying there was no longer room in 
the country for capitalists. After FDR himself died in April 1945, Gray resurrected 
Warbucks a few months later. Asked why, Gray smirked that “the situation changed 
last April.”

Swinging to a new sound
At the beginning of the Great Depression, popular music was 
dominated by what has been referred to as the “country club” 
sound: Full orchestras, with carefully balanced horn and string 
sections, produced music to soothe — or stupefy — an audience. 
Such music filled radio airtime okay, but it didn’t sell records, 
particularly in an economy without a lot of disposable income. In 
fact, the uninspired music and the rapid rise of radio combined 
with the hard times to almost kill off the record industry. Between 
1927 and 1932, record sales fell from 104 million per year to 6 
million. The entire music industry went from a $50-million-a-year 
concern to a $250,000-a-year basket case.
 
That changed on August 21, 1935. A 25-year-old clarinet player 
and bandleader named Benny Goodman was performing with 
his orchestra at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles. Bored and 
depressed because the group’s cross-country tour had been a flop, 
Goodman decided to “swing” in the last set, playing up-tempo and 
improvised stuff the musicians usually saved for after-hours jams.
The crowd went nuts for the new sound, which was really a 
derivation of jazz that black musicians had been playing for years.
 
“A good swing band, smashing away at full speed, with the 
trumpeters and clarinetists rising in turn . . . and the drummers 
going into long drawn-out rhythmical frenzies could reduce its less 
inhibited auditors to sheer emotional vibration,” wrote historian 
Frederick Lewis Allen.
Some thought the music was a health hazard. A psychologist told 
The New York Times that swing music was “dangerously hypnotic” 
because it was “cunningly devised to a faster tempo” than the 
average adult’s pulse rate of 72 beats per minute.
Despite such worries, swing music swept the country, and 
Goodman’s band was soon joined by groups headed by Tommy 
and Jimmy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Bob Crosby, Duke Ellington, 
Count Basie, Harry James, and Artie Shaw.
Record sales rebounded to 35 million in 1938, and records were the 
best-selling Christmas gift that year. In addition to the popularity of 
the swing sound, several other factors came into play:
 
✓ Radio-phonograph consoles: These items featured both a 
radio and a phonograph and became popular because they 
offered listeners an option when they wanted to hear a 
specific song.

 Chapter 10: Having Fun in Spite of It All 171
 
✓ Radio commercials: As radio ads became more numerous, 
they became more irritating for people who wanted to listen 
to uninterrupted music. The consoles allowed an easy way to 
switch to records.
 
✓ Jukeboxes: By the end of the 1930s, an estimated 325,000 
bars, cafés, and other spots had record machines in which 
customers could drop a nickel and hear their favorite tune. 
The “jukes” used a lot of records.
Drinking and Driving
On January 16, 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution took effect. Popularly known as Prohibition, the 
amendment made it illegal to make or sell alcoholic beverages 
in the United States. But it didn’t take long to see that the idea of 
making America a better place by banning booze was a flop.
There is some statistical evidence that Americans drank less after 
Prohibition than they did before it began. But Prohibition also 
fostered illegal activity on the part of otherwise law-abiding 
citizens; gave criminals a monopoly on a lucrative industry; and 
added to a general disrespect for law and order.
By the third year of the Great Depression, two more pragmatic 
arguments against Prohibition had been added:
 
✓ A legal liquor industry would mean new, legitimate jobs.
 
✓ A legal liquor industry presented an opportunity for govern-
ments to raise revenues through taxes on alcoholic drinks.
In the 1932 presidential race, the repeal of Prohibition was not 
much of an issue. Democratic candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt 
favored repeal, while Republican candidate Herbert Hoover 
favored at least letting the states decide. But Prohibition was still 
a controversial enough issue that it dominated as many local and 
state races that year as the hard economic times did.
Bringing back legal booze
In February 1933, Congress submitted the question of repeal to 
conventions called in each state. While waiting for the necessary 
three-fourths of the states to vote for repeal, new President 
Roosevelt signed a law in his first month in office that allowed the 
sale of two types of liquor: beer with an alcoholic content of up to 
3.2 percent, and light-alcohol wines. “I think this would be a good 
time for a beer,” FDR grinned after signing the measure.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
172
 
At 3:33 p.m. (Mountain Time) on December 5, 1933, Utah became 
the 36th state to ratify the Twenty-First Amendment, thus repealing 
Prohibition. Nationwide, people celebrated with a drink or two.
Well, not quite everywhere. Legal alcohol was in short supply, 
leaving much of the country’s liquor in the hands of bootleggers. 
“Liquor has been sold illegally for 13 years,” New Jersey Governor 
A. Harry Moore observed, “and it will not hurt if this is done for a 
few days more.”
Drinking also did not become legal everywhere. The amendment 
allowed states and counties to decide for themselves if they 
wanted to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages. Fifteen states 
made selling liquor an exclusive state government monopoly. But 
only eight states chose to stay dry altogether, leaving 40 states 
where people in the Great Depression had something else to spend 
their recreation dollars on.
Touring America
“We are,” noted humorist Will Rogers in 1931, “the first nation in 
the history of the world to go to the poor house in an automobile.”
As was customary with Rogers’ witticisms, this one had a large 
chunk of truth in it. Even in the depths of the Great Depression, 
Americans never lost their love for the automobile. At the beginning 
of the depression in 1929, there were 26.8 million registered vehicles 
in the country. In 1941, there were 38.9 million, a 45 percent 
increase during hard times. In 1937, half of U.S. families owned 
cars, and a New York City auto show that same year featured an 
impressive 200 models of cars, trucks, and even a few car-trucks.
Researchers looking at the spending and social habits of Muncie, 
Indiana, residents found that car ownership “was one of the most 
depression-proof elements of the city’s life . . . far less vulnerable, 
apparently, than marriages, divorces, new babies, clothing, jewelry 
and most other measurable things, both large and small.”
 
One reason it was easy to stay in love with cars is that cars were 
becoming easier to love. Improvements in suspension, brakes, and 
tires made cars safer, more comfortable, and more reliable in the 
1930s than a decade earlier. At 5 to 10 cents a gallon (79 cents to 
$1.58 in 2008 currency), gasoline was still relatively cheap. And 
more and more cars were equipped with amenities such as radios.
Sunday drives to the beach or into the countryside were favorite 
pastimes: “Give Americans a one-piece bathing suit, a hamburger, 
and five gallons of gasoline,” Rogers observed “and they are just as 
tickled as a movie star with a new divorce.”

 Chapter 10: Having Fun in Spite of It All 173
While foreign travel by Americans dropped, “touring” trips around 
the United States became popular in the 1930s, especially to 
national parks and monuments, which saw a 400 percent increase 
in visitors between 1935 and 1939. Gas stations and lunch rooms 
sprouted alongside the nation’s highways, along with motor 
hotels — motels — which were hybrids of urban hotels and rural 
motor camps.
Coupled with the forests of billboards that sprang up, the mass of 
roadside conveniences transformed U.S. highways, in the words of 
one critic, “into the ugliest spots on earth.” Maybe. But at least this 
type of travel was affordable.
Lessons Learned
The Great Depression changed the way many Americans looked 
at work and its relation to life. The long-held ideal that hard work 
guaranteed success was a bit hard to swallow for the guy who 
had worked diligently for 20 years, only to find himself suddenly 
unemployed — and unemployable — when times got hard.
That, in turn, changed how he felt about leisure time. There was 
less guilt about enjoying one’s self and more enthusiasm in finding 
ways to do it. Oh, and Americans managed to maintain their love 
for the automobile throughout the 1930s.
Here’s a look at how leisure time stacked up in the early 21st 
century — and how the country’s love affair with cars became 
more of a love–hate relationship.
Changing how we spend leisure time
“We work,” the Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote, “to have leisure.” 
In the United States of the 21st century, Aristotle’s observation 
may be more accurately worded, “We work to have leisure by 
ourselves.”
In the 21st century, leisure time takes a much different form than 
it did in the Great Depression. In the 1930s, hours away from work 
were more compartmentalized. For the most part, people worked 
from a set time to a set time on set days. That meant it was fairly 
easy to schedule social activities with friends and family.
 
In contrast, studies have found that modern leisure time tends to 
be more fragmented. In a 2008 Harris poll, people estimated they 
had lost four hours of weekly leisure time from the year before, 
while at the same time estimating they were working only one hour 

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
174
longer per week. Researchers theorized the difference was “gray 
hours,” where people weren’t physically at work but were checking 
on things at work via home computers, cellular phones, or personal 
digital assistants (PDAs).
The proliferation of wireless communication devices makes it 
simultaneously easier and harder to be away from work. It also 
makes it more likely that Americans will use their leisure time 
in smaller chunks. That means leisure time is becoming more 
individualized and less communal. A 2006 survey, for example, 
found that 75 percent of respondents would rather watch a movie 
at home than at a theater, mostly because they were “too busy” to 
go to the theater.
The privatization of leisure time was also reflected in a 2007 study 
of leisure time use by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 
survey found that the average American enjoys just under five hours 
per day of leisure time and spends 2.6 hours watching television, 
compared to 38 minutes socializing or talking with others.
Spending time in traffic
The traffic engineer Henry Barnes once said, “Traffic is the 
mother-in-law in the otherwise perfect romance between 
Americans and their automobiles.”
The “mother-in-law” is much harder to ignore these days than 
it was in the 1930s. There were 247.3 million motor vehicles 
registered in the country in 2007. That translates to about 1.3 
Americans for each vehicle, compared to 3.3 people per registered 
vehicle in 1940.
More vehicles means more traffic, and more traffic means 
significant losses of time and money, as reported by a 2005 study:
 
✓ Drivers snarled in traffic burned 2.9 billion gallons of wasted 
fuel, enough to fill 58 supertankers.
 
✓ Traffic jams consumed 4.2 billion hours of time.
 
✓ The wasted time and fuel carried a price tag of $78 billion, a 
420 percent increase from 1982 figures.
The study concluded that drivers in urban areas waste the 
equivalent of one week per year in traffic. That’s a fair chunk of 
leisure time!

Labor Rising: Unions in 
the Great Depression
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a beating before the Great Depression
▶ Getting a new deal from Washington
▶ Splitting the labor movement
▶ Striking — and getting struck
▶ Lessons learned
L
abor unions embarked on a roller coaster ride of highs and 
lows from just before World War I to just before the onset of 
the Great Depression. They were nearer the bottom than the top 
when the economic hard times hit. The 1930s proved to be even 
more chaotic than the 1920s for organized labor, but this time the 
decade ended with U.S. workers higher than they had ever been.
This chapter examines labor’s story from the entry of the United 
States into the world war in 1917 to the beginning of the Roosevelt 
administration in 1933. I then take a look at what Roosevelt did, 
and didn’t do, for labor and how the labor movement split itself in 
two. The chapter ends by recounting some of the biggest — and 
bloodiest — strikes in U.S. history. Put on a hardhat and grab a 
picket sign; it’s going to be a bumpy ride.
Disorganized Labor
Even before the United States entered World War I in April 1917, 
organized labor had pledged to be a good patriot. In March that 
year, 79 unions promised “full labor support” once the country 
was in the war, as long as basic union rights were protected. The 
federal government, in turn, agreed to enforce union standards in 
all government contracts.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
176
Despite the mutual pledges of cooperation, however, 4,450 strikes 
occurred by the end of 1917, involving 1 million workers. The 
cause of most of the disputes was that wages were not keeping 
pace with rising wartime prices.
So government officials and union representatives conferred 
again and agreed in April 1918 that a new agency was needed to 
try to head off strikes. The government established the National 
War Labor Board, which served as an arbiter in labor–business 
disputes. The government also promised that in its contracts with 
companies it would insist on eight-hour workdays (as much as 
possible), on the recognition of workers’ right to organize, and 
on equal pay for equal work for the increasing number of women 
entering the workforce.
Even without the government guarantees, organized labor had 
reason to smile during the war. As the large number of workers 
entering the military made the civilian labor market tighter, wages 
rose, and so did union membership — from about 3 million in 1916 
to 4.1 million in 1919 and 5 million in 1920.
 
But as prices continued to rise even after the war ended, wages 
again lost ground. The result was more than 3,500 strikes in 1919. 
A multi-union strike in Seattle virtually paralyzed the city for 
four days. In Boston, most of the city’s police force walked out. 
Steelworkers and coal miners also staged widespread strikes.
The steel strikes were broken by the companies using replacement 
workers (sneeringly referred to as scabs), and by companies’ 
propaganda that alleged the strikers were part of a communist 
conspiracy to overthrow capitalism. The coal strikes were stopped 
when a federal court issued an injunction against the strikers for 
engaging in work stoppages that threatened national security.
Losing ground in good and bad times
In 1920, the country ran into a post-war recession. By the time it 
ended in 1922, 5 million people were out of work. As usual when 
unemployment is high, union membership sagged, dropping from 5 
million in 1920 to 3.5 million in 1923.
But a curious thing happened when the country began to pros-
per again: Union membership continued to sag. One reason was 
that technological and organizational improvements had greatly 
increased the productivity of the average worker. That meant 
fewer workers were needed to produce the same amount of goods. 
That, in turn, resulted in unemployment rates staying fairly high 
during the decade of the 1920s, even when the economy improved.

 Chapter 11: Labor Rising: Unions in the Great Depression 177
Another reason union membership stalled was that many employers 
insisted on open shops, which meant that workers did not have to 
join a union and that no union had exclusive rights to deal with 
management on behalf of workers. Some companies also insisted 
on what were called yellow dog contracts, which new workers were 
forced to sign. The contracts forbade the workers from joining a 
union, thus reducing their rights to those of a “yellow dog.”
Employers also co-opted unions by embracing the idea of welfare 
capitalism. The term referred to the practice of companies offering 
benefits to workers (often in lieu of pay raises) that ranged from 
company-sponsored social clubs to profit-sharing programs. 
Workers could buy company stock at a discount, or they received 
it as a bonus for good work. By 1926, some 600 companies had 
established employee representation plans, which in effect were 
company unions operated by the personnel department that 
provided at least the veneer of someone looking out for the 
workers’ welfare.
 
“The assertion may be boldly made that the decreasing membership 
in most of the unions, and the great difficulty they are experiencing in 
holding their members together, is due to the fact that the 
employers — the so-called ‘soulless corporations’ — are doing 
more for the welfare of workers than the unions themselves,” 
boasted an official of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Exposing management’s dark side
Of course not every company or every industry took a paternal 
interest in its workers. Many companies relied on spies placed 
among workers to help the firms weed out union organizers. Some 
companies conspired with corrupt union leaders to pad the leaders’ 
pockets, in return for the union bosses ensuring rank-and-file 
members didn’t resort to job actions such as slowdowns or strikes.
Working conditions were often appalling. Steel mill workers averaged 
workweeks of 69 hours. One Pittsburgh steel mill safety manager 
admitted in 1928 that the mill “had a lot of equipment that is out 
of date, lacks the new safety devices and is liable to break down at 
any time, causing serious accidents.” But, he added, management 
wouldn’t replace it because it still worked.
That kind of attitude led to huge numbers of worker casualties. 
In one year, the steel industry averaged 63 injuries a day, four of 
them resulting in death or permanent injury. It was common for 
steelworkers’ clothes to catch on fire; if they survived, they had to 
pay to replace them.

Some companies made no pretense of having benevolent feelings 
toward their employees. When a congressional committee asked 
Pittsburgh Coal Company chairman Richard B. Mellon why the 
company kept machine guns mounted at its coal pits, he replied, 
“you cannot run the mines without them.”
Sinking with the economy
By 1929, union membership had sunk to 3.4 million, lower than 
at any time since 1917. While corporate profits had grown by 
62 percent in the decade, wages had risen only 8 percent. That 
meant workers were ill prepared for the economic Armageddon 
that followed the October 1929 stock market crash.
In fact, they appeared shell-shocked. As unemployment rose and 
paychecks shrank, U.S. workers grew decidedly less militant. 
Companies pledged not to cut wages and then ignored their 
pledges. The fringe benefits of “welfare capitalism” were rescinded. 
Still, there were few strikes. Organized labor made little attempt to 
pressure the federal government into launching recovery programs, 
nor did it strenuously object when companies unilaterally cut 
wages.
 
“Today labor stands patient and hopeful,” noted the Cleveland 
Plain Dealer. “Never before has there been a period of depression 
so free from labor strife . . . in the face of enormous hardship, labor 
has showed its good citizenship and sturdy American stamina.”
By early 1933, the 110-union American Federation of Labor (AFL) 
was losing 7,000 members a week, and overall union membership 
dipped below 3 million. What was left of organized labor looked to 
Washington, D.C., to see what a new president could do for them.
A New Deal for Workers
During the 1932 presidential contest between incumbent Republican 
Herbert Hoover and Democratic challenger Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
most labor groups, including the American Federation of Labor, 
officially stayed neutral.
That didn’t stop most rank-and-file workers from wholeheartedly 
embracing Roosevelt. The wealthy Roosevelt promised not to 
forget “the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.” 
He campaigned for direct government relief to struggling families 
and stated his support for an unemployment insurance program. 
All that warmed the hearts of working people.

 Chapter 11: Labor Rising: Unions in the Great Depression 179
 
“I am a long ways from you in distance, yet my faith is in you,” a 
South Carolina textile mill worker wrote Roosevelt. “My heart is 
with you and I am for you, sink or swim.”
The feeling wasn’t necessarily mutual on FDR’s part. He was more 
interested in improving workers’ economic status than their 
workplace status, and his feelings were more paternal than fraternal 
when it came to unions. That reality may have been reflected by 
the fact that his Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, was a social 
worker by training, not a union activist or official.
 
Even so, Roosevelt enjoyed strong labor support throughout the 
Great Depression. In his reelection campaign in 1936, labor groups 
formed a political action committee called the Non-Partisan League 
to help. Unions contributed nearly $800,000 to his campaign, about 
$500,000 of which came from the United Mine Workers (UMW).
The UMW was headed by labor’s leading figure in the 1930s, John 
L. Lewis. After Lewis and Roosevelt had a falling out over remarks 
FDR made about a 1937 steel strike, Lewis withdrew his support 
of the president and endorsed FDR’s GOP rival, Wendell Willkie, in 
1940. Even with Lewis’s defection, however, Roosevelt won third 
and fourth terms with strong labor backing.
In return, Roosevelt backed several key pieces of pro-labor 
legislation during the Great Depression, although not all with 
the same enthusiasm.
Section 7(a): Supporting 
the right to unionize
In June 1933, Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act 
(NIRA). Among the bill’s provisions (the rest of which are covered 
in Chapter 13) was Section 7(a). This section contained three key 
provisions having to do with labor:
 
✓ Employees had the right to organize and to bargain as a group 
without employer interference.
 
✓ No new employee could be made to join a “company union” or 
be prohibited from joining any union he or she chose.
 
✓ Companies would agree to minimum wages, maximum 
workweeks, and other workplace conditions, to be established 
by the industry to which they belonged and approved by the 
president. While industries worked on their own codes, they 
were asked to agree to a minimum wage of 40 cents per hour 
and a 40-hour maximum workweek, as well as the abolition of 
child labor under the age of 16.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
180
 
“In my inaugural,” Roosevelt said after signing the bill, “I laid 
down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this 
country. It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which 
depends on paying less than living wages has any right to continue.”
Union leaders were ecstatic with the NIRA. Union recruiters 
worked overtime to sign up new members. John L. Lewis, the 
United Mine Workers president, had sound trucks blare “the 
president wants you to unionize . . . it is your patriotic duty to 
unionize.” People did. The AFL claimed to have added 1.5 million 
workers, the United Mine Workers 300,000, and the International 
Ladies Garment Workers Union 150,000.
 
The joy was short-lived. Some employers coerced workers into 
joining company unions and declined to negotiate with other unions. 
With what Time magazine said were 7,000 different industries 
drawing up codes and more than 10,000 pages of federal regulations, 
the program’s framework became a hopeless snarl. Employers 
thought it went too far; labor decided it didn’t go far enough. A 
National Labor Relations Board was created in 1934 and charged 
with settling disputes. But it lacked the authority to enforce its 
decisions, and in 1935 the U.S. Supreme Court made the issue moot 
by overturning the NIRA for being unconstitutional.
The Wagner Act: Giving 
unions real strength
While the NIRA had proved to be a mess, its rejection by the 
Supreme Court left labor without any meaningful legal protections. 
That situation changed within six weeks of the court’s decision, 
however, when Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act 
and Roosevelt signed it into law on July 5, 1935.
Better known as the Wagner Act (after its chief author, Senator 
Robert Wagner of New York), the measure guaranteed the rights 
of workers to form their own union. It specifically prohibited 
employers from interfering in any way with worker organizing, and 
it required companies to bargain exclusively with whatever union 
workers voted to join.
 
Most importantly, it created a new National Labor Relations Board 
(NLRB) to monitor union elections, hear complaints about unfair 
labor practices, and issue “cease and desist” orders that could be 
appealed to a federal court.

 Chapter 11: Labor Rising: Unions in the Great Depression 181
 
“By preventing practices which tend to destroy the independence 
of labor, it seeks for every worker within its scope, that freedom of 
choice and action which is justly his,” said Roosevelt, who was not 
a big fan of the bill until he saw how popular it was with Congress 
and the public.
One thing the act did not do was set any standards for wages or 
hours. Nor did it require employers to sign a contract with a union.
 
Still, the measure was a huge triumph for labor, perhaps the biggest 
in U.S. history. For more than a century, the labor movement in 
the United States had struggled against a host of obstacles that 
blocked its right to organize in a meaningful manner. Now it had 
that right. The measure also firmly established the role of the 
federal government in relations between labor and management.
Many legal experts expected the Supreme Court would overturn 
the Wagner Act as it had the National Industrial Recovery Act. 
As a result, many employers ignored the law. The National Labor 
Relations Board conducted only 76 elections between 1935 and 
1937. But the court upheld the act in April 1937, and between 1937 
and 1940, the NLRB supervised 3,310 elections.
The Fair Labor Standards Act: 
Raising wages, cutting hours
Two issues that weren’t settled by the Wagner Act were establishing 
a federal minimum wage and setting a limit on how many hours an 
employee could be required to work without extra compensation.
One reason for these omissions was that starting in 1918, the 
Supreme Court had rejected several minimum wage laws as 
unconstitutional. Another was that some labor groups feared that 
adopting a minimum wage would give employers an excuse to use 
it as a maximum wage too. Southern lawmakers were afraid that a 
minimum wage law would remove the region’s only attraction for 
industry: its low wages. And conservative members of Congress 
thought the idea was the next big step on the way to socialism.
But Roosevelt had made the issue part of his 1936 reelection 
campaign and was determined to push a bill through. When 
Congress failed to act in the summer of 1937 (even after the 
Supreme Court had made an about-face and had found a state 
minimum wage law constitutional), FDR summoned lawmakers into 
special session in late 1937.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
182
A bill — the Fair Labor Standards Act — was finally approved in 
June 1938, but not before it endured 72 amendments or proposed 
amendments, most of them aimed at narrowing how many industries 
would be affected by the bill. One congressman joked that if the 
measure passed, the Secretary of Labor should be required to 
report within 90 days “whether anyone is covered by the bill.”
 
In fact, the final version of the bill applied to industries that covered 
only about 20 percent of the workforce. It set an initial minimum 
hourly wage of 25 cents (which was to move to 40 cents in 1940), 
and workweeks were limited to 44 hours (decreasing to 40 hours in 
1940). Extra hours required pay at time-and-a-half rates.
Just as importantly, the bill set 14 as the minimum age for workers 
outside school hours and 16 during school hours. Children had 
been shamefully exploited during the Great Depression. A 1938 
survey of 449 children by the Department of Labor’s Children’s 
Bureau found that nearly 25 percent of them worked 60 hours or 
more per week for a median wage of just over $4 a week.
 
“It is the most far-reaching, the most far-sighted program for the 
benefit of workers ever adopted here or in any other country,” 
Roosevelt said the night before he signed the bill. “Without question 
it starts us toward a better standard of living and increases 
purchasing power to buy the products of farm and factory.”
Even though the bill didn’t cover everyone, the 12 million people 
who were making less than 40 cents an hour were grateful. And 
it served as the base for future changes in wages, hours, and 
child-labor laws.
Forming New Kinds of Unions
The American Federation of Labor (AFL) was established in the 
1880s to serve as an association of autonomous unions, mostly 
representing skilled workers such as carpenters and machinists. 
The AFL’s goals were both mercenary and pragmatic: to get as 
much money, job security, and decent working conditions as 
possible for its members.
Under the cautious leadership of a former cigar maker named 
Samuel Gompers and (after Gompers’s death in 1924) a former coal 
miner named William Green, the AFL had focused its recruiting and 
organizing efforts almost exclusively on skilled workers. Part of the 
reason for this focus was discriminatory. Skilled workers tended 
to be white and second- or third-generation Americans. Many 
unskilled workers were minorities or immigrants.

 Chapter 11: Labor Rising: Unions in the Great Depression 183
 
What the AFL either failed or refused to recognize, however, was 
that as technology changed the workplace, it also changed the 
worker. More and more jobs were filled by unskilled men who 
performed specific — and often mind-numbingly repetitious — 
tasks on assembly lines and were as interchangeable to their 
employers as the parts they assembled.
The strength of a union in the new workplace was in numbers 
of members. But the AFL not only declined to pursue that large 
number of unskilled workers, it also insisted on compartmentalizing 
its members into small bargaining groups. If it took 19 men doing 
different tasks to make a car tire, for example, the AFL wanted 19 
unions to represent them.
And despite being the leading labor force at the onset of the Great 
Depression, AFL leaders were more diffident and accommodating 
than aggressive when it came to making labor’s voice heard. One 
AFL leader, however, was about to disturb the peace.
Setting up the CIO
The head of the United Mine Workers, John L. Lewis, was big, 
bushy-browed, and bombastic. A former miner who had once 
managed an opera house, Lewis had a theatrical manner that 
either amused or outraged his associates.
 
Once, when explaining why he seemed always to be in the spotlight, 
Lewis said, “He who tooteth not his own horn, the same shall not 
be tooted.” When asked if he were worried about using known 
communists to help recruit union members, Lewis replied 
rhetorically, “Who gets the duck, the dog or the hunter?”
Unlike most other union leaders, Lewis saw great value for the labor 
movement in organizing unskilled workers. He also argued that it 
was better to have a few very large unions than a lot of small ones.
In October 1935, at an AFL convention in Atlantic City, Lewis 
became embroiled in a series of confrontations with federation 
leaders over the question of organizing unskilled workers. In one 
instance, he socked the leader of the carpenters union in the jaw 
after the man called Lewis a “bastard.” (“Good for you,” a disaffected 
carpenter telegraphed Lewis. “Now sock him again.”)
 
With a few other union leaders, Lewis ultimately decided to take 
on the task of organizing the unskilled. The leaders created the 
Committee on Industrial Organization, later renamed the Congress 
of Industrial Organizations, or CIO, and divorced themselves from 
the AFL. “They have smote me hip and thigh,” the colorful Lewis 
said of the split, “and right merrily did I return the blows.”

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
184
Fighting in the ranks
From its beginning, the Congress of Industrial Organizations 
worked to expand the ranks of organized labor. It launched 
recruiting drives in industries such as tobacco, textiles, and 
laundries whose workforces were dominated by women and 
minorities. It established civil rights units within its local unions, 
and it even allowed in communists. “So what if he’s a Red,” 
snapped one union leader of a new member. “He’s our Red.”
The CIO was also more aggressive than the AFL in its negotiating 
tactics. It launched major offensives in the automobile and steel 
industries that involved violent confrontations, as I explain in the 
next section. And it was more politically active than the AFL, 
contributing money and campaign workers to local, state, and 
national contests.
 
The competition between the two groups was both good and bad 
for labor. On the one hand, it helped swell union membership as 
the groups vied for members. By the end of 1937, the CIO claimed 
3.7 million members, while the AFL claimed 3.4 million. Combined, 
that was more than twice as many unionists as there had been in 
1933. On the other hand, the deep rivalry between the two groups 
and their leaders (the AFL’s Green despised the CIO’s Lewis, and 
vice versa) prevented labor from speaking with one voice.
The two groups quarreled about the best way to establish federal 
minimum wage and workweek laws. Complaining that the National 
Labor Relations Board favored the CIO, the AFL worked with 
conservative members of Congress to try to weaken the board. 
The AFL also accused its rival of being too cozy with communists.
When the country slipped into a new and deep recession in the fall 
of 1937, the AFL was better equipped to handle it. Its unions were 
older and more established, and its members were better able 
and more willing to pay dues because many of them worked in 
specialized jobs that paid better wages and were more recession-
proof. By the end of the decade, the AFL had reasserted itself as 
labor’s dominant organization. But the CIO’s existence also forced 
the AFL to widen its umbrella and begin admitting unskilled and 
semi-skilled workers. In 1955, the AFL and CIO merged into a united 
federation.

 Chapter 11: Labor Rising: Unions in the Great Depression 185
Considering the workers 
no one wanted
One labor group that drew no interest from either the AFL or the 
CIO during the Great Depression was the farm workers of the South 
and Southwest. They had been specifically excluded from the 
protection of federal labor laws governing the minimum wage, 
number of hours worked, and union organizing rights.
 
That lack of federal protection made forming farm worker unions 
not only difficult but also dangerous. “Only fanatics are willing to 
live in shacks or tents and get their heads broken in the interest of 
migratory workers,” summed up one labor leader.
Many of the farm workers were Mexicans or first- or second-
generation Mexican Americans. The AFL had spent time and 
money trying to have them banned because they allegedly filled 
jobs that should have been filled by white Americans.
Still, some unionizing efforts were made, particularly in California, 
which was the nation’s second-biggest farm state (trailing only 
Iowa in the value of its crop production). California farms were 
often giant “food factories” owned by companies such as Standard 
Oil, Shell Oil, and the Southern Pacific Railroad. There was often a 
glut of labor, and it was not unusual for a grower to promise one 
wage, only to reduce it when the workers reached the fields or 
orchards.
In 1930, communists helped workers form the Agricultural Workers 
Industrial League, which struck the fields of California’s Imperial 
Valley. In 1931, workers walked out of Santa Clara Valley canneries 
after pay rates were cut by 20 percent. In 1932, there was a 
pea-picker strike. In 1933, it was strawberries; in 1936, lettuce.
In almost every case, tactics that ranged from the use of replacement 
workers to shootings and beatings by police or hired thugs 
defeated the strikers. Not only did the major labor groups fail to 
help, but most state and federal officials were also disinterested.
Not until the 1970s would farm workers succeed in gaining mean-
ingful union representation, and even then they would remain 
among the most forgotten of the U.S. economy’s forgotten men and 
women.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression

Strikes and Fights
Even with the federal government lining up solidly behind labor’s 
right to organize and workers’ rights to decent wages and working 
conditions, some big business leaders weren’t ready to surrender 
their old ways of doing things.
 
Some companies used spies to pose as workers and promptly 
report on any talk of forming a union. The Pinkerton Detective 
Agency earned $1.75 million between 1933 and 1936 spying for 
automakers. “We must do it to obtain the information we need in 
dealing with our employees,” Chrysler Corporation Vice President 
Herman Weckler told a Senate committee.
When labor trouble appeared imminent, industry could send for 
the likes of Pearl Bergoff, a burly New York “consultant” who 
would send a small army of heavily armed thugs with names like 
“Two Guns” and “Chowderhead” (really!) to act as strikebreakers. 
Machine guns, billy clubs, and tear gas were standard equipment 
for Bergoff’s men. The Ford Motor Company had its own in-house 
paramilitary force of 3,000 toughs.
There were other forms of intimidation. Georgia Governor Eugene 
Talmadge built concentration camps and had them ready, he said, 
for labor pickets. Pennsylvania mine owners had homes of striking 
miners bombed. And a textile industry journal editorialized that “a 
few hundred funerals will have a quieting effect” on labor unrest.
Shutting down cities
All of this anti-union activity was in response to the fact that in 
1934, organized labor shook off the torpor with which it had begun 
the decade. There were 1,800 strikes during the year, involving 1.5 
million people. The smallest strikes involved a handful of workers and 
were over in a day or two. The biggest strikes shut down cities, 
and often involved violence, as depicted in Figure 11-1.
In Minneapolis, strikes by teamsters in May and July 1934 erupted 
into battles that pitted the city’s employers and police against 
much of its working class. Two strikers were shot and killed, as 
were two members of a “citizens’ army” organized by employers.
A funeral for one of the striking members drew a crowd of 100,000, 
and the strikes shut down most of the city’s trucking industry. After 
Minnesota Governor Floyd B. Olson declared martial law in late July 
and sent in National Guard troops, a settlement was reached, and 
the anti-union forces’ dominance of the state was broken.

 Chapter 11: Labor Rising: Unions in the Great Depression 187
Figure 11-1: Unionized strikers fight with a group of nonunion replacement 
employees as they try to cross the picket line at a factory.
On the West Coast, longshoremen and sailors began an 84-day 
strike at every major port on the coast in May 1934. Battles 
between strikers and police or private security broke out in the 
Los Angeles region’s port of San Pedro, where two strikers were 
killed, and also in Oakland, Seattle, and Portland.
In San Francisco, two more strikers were killed in early July. 
After the deaths, virtually every union member in the city joined a 
general strike on July 16. For four days, the city came to a halt.
 
“No street cars were operating,” a journalist reported, “no buses, 
taxis, no delivery wagons except milk and bread trucks, which 
were operated with the permission of the general strike committee. 
No filling stations were open, no theaters, no shops.”
Of course, not every newspaper saw it the same way. “The situation 
in San Francisco is not correctly described as a ‘general strike,’” 
sniffed the Los Angeles Times. “What is actually in progress there 
is an insurrection, a communist-inspired and -led revolt against 
organized government. There is but one thing to be done — put 
down the revolt with any force necessary.”

Whatever it was called, the strike ended after employers agreed to 
arbitration, which resulted in the longshoremen being given most 
of the pay increase they had sought and the right for their union to 
choose its members.
Sitting down on the job
On December 30, 1936, workers at a General Motors auto plant 
in Flint, Michigan, shut down the assembly line and sat down. 
Over the next few days, workers at 16 other GM plants who were 
members of the two-year-old United Auto Workers (UAW) union 
followed their lead, and the largest manufacturing company in the 
world was brought to its knees. Before the strike began, GM was 
making 2,000 cars a day. During the 44-day strike, it averaged 20.
Unlike most strikes, the GM shutdown was as much about the 
breakneck pace of the assembly line as it was about wages and 
hours. “We don’t even have time to go to the toilet,” complained 
one GM worker. “You have to run to the toilet and run back.”
 
Also unlike most strikes, the GM workers traded the outside 
picket lines for the relative comfort of the indoor assembly lines. 
The sit-down tactic prevented the company from bringing in 
replacement workers, and it made it harder for police and hired 
strikebreakers to break heads without risking breaking company 
equipment.
That doesn’t mean there wasn’t violence. When police tried to 
prevent food from being delivered to the strikers, a fight broke 
out. Using plant fire hoses, the strikers forced the police to retreat. 
Michigan Governor Frank Murphy, who had just been elected 
with labor’s help, decided not to send in the National Guard. And 
General Motors, which was losing $1 million a day, gave in.
 
The UAW, which was affiliated with John L. Lewis’s Congress of 
Industrial Organizations (CIO), won higher pay, shorter hours, and 
a slowed-down production line. Other auto companies eventually 
followed, with Ford holding out against unionization longest, until 
1941. The UAW’s victory helped its membership grow from 88,000 
to 400,000 in the first nine months of 1937.
Sit-down strikes became the rage. Unhappy workers adopted the 
tactic in department stores, barbershops, hotel kitchens, and 
ocean liners. In March 1937, there were 170 sit-down strikes 
involving 167,000 workers. Having defeated the auto industry, 
meanwhile, the CIO took aim at another big industry: steel.

 Chapter 11: Labor Rising: Unions in the Great Depression 189
Beating “Big Steel”
In 1934, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) had won 
signed contracts from the coal industry, which supplied the fuel to 
run steel mills. In early 1937, it won the right to organize from the 
auto industry, which consumed much of the steel mills’ product. So 
CIO leader John L. Lewis decided it was time to go after the steel 
industry itself, starting with its biggest company, United States 
Steel. The company had gross earnings of $35.2 million in 1934 
($5.7 billion in 2008 dollars), and yet not a single employee there 
was considered a full-time worker. The average steelworker was 
making less than $400 per year in 1937.
 
“If we can organize here,” Lewis said of U.S. Steel, “the rest (of the 
industry) will follow. If the crouching lion can be routed, it is a safe 
bet that the hyenas in the adjacent bush may be scattered along 
the plains.”
But Lewis overestimated the “lion” and underestimated the “hyenas.” 
In March 1937, Lewis and U.S. Steel board chairman Myron Taylor 
stunned the country by announcing agreement on a union contract 
that had been negotiated quietly by the two men. Taylor, mindful of 
labor’s victory over General Motors, agreed to a contract calling for 
an eight-hour day and 40-hour week, $5 a day wages, and paid vaca-
tions. No strike had been required, not even the explicit threat of one.
Losing to “Little Steel”
The other steel companies, however, proved to be far less agreeable. 
Called “Little Steel” because of their size relative to U.S. Steel, the 
firms made it clear they were not in a union mood, particularly if it 
meant dealing with Lewis and his CIO.
 
“I won’t have a contract, verbal or written, with an irresponsible, 
racketeering, violent communistic body like the CIO,” said Thomas 
M. Girdler, president of Republic Steel. “And until they pass a law 
making me, I am not going to do it.”
On May 25, 1937, about 76,000 workers walked out of 27 steel 
plants in seven states. The companies retaliated by bringing in 
scabs and heavily fortifying the plants with armed guards and 
“strikebreakers” who alternately urged the strikers to return to 
work and threatened them.
Before the strike was over, 16 striking workers were killed and 
hundreds injured. Ten of the deaths occurred on Memorial Day, 
when police fired on demonstrators in Chicago, shooting many of 
the demonstrators in the back as they fled.

Part III: Living Through the Great Depression  
190
 
A Senate investigation into the “Memorial Day Massacre” concluded 
that “from the evidence we think it plain that the force employed by 
the police was far in excess of that which the occasion required. Its 
use must be ascribed to either gross inefficiency in the performance 
of police duty, or a deliberate attempt to intimidate the strikers.”
Intimidated or not, the steel workers lost the battle with Little 
Steel. They returned to work in July without contracts. (They did 
eventually win the war in 1942 when they signed contracts with all 
the Little Steel companies.)
Growing tired of labor strife
One of the reasons the Little Steel strike failed was that President 
Roosevelt chose not to get involved, despite personal pleas from 
John L. Lewis.
 
“A plague on both your houses,” Roosevelt said, echoing a line 
from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet and signaling that there were 
limits on the federal government’s role in settling labor disputes.
Roosevelt’s stance echoed the feelings of many Americans about 
the almost constant unrest stirred up by labor fights in the decade. 
There were an estimated 22,000 strikes in the 1930s, involving 
millions of workers, thousands of injuries, and scores of deaths.
A 1937 Gallup Poll found that 76 percent of Americans favored the 
existence of unions, but almost as many opposed sit-down strikes as 
violations of private property rights. (The Supreme Court outlawed 
them in 1939.) Most people thought unions should have the right to 
organize, but most people also thought industrialists like Henry Ford 
should have the right not to let them organize at their companies.
But while the public’s ambivalent feelings about labor unions 
would continue into the 21st century, labor had not only survived 
the nation’s hardest economic decade but also made itself a force 
in the U.S. economy.
Lessons Learned
Two of the Great Depression’s biggest contributions to the U.S. 
economic culture were the advent of a federal minimum wage and 
the development of organized labor as a significant force in the 
financial and political course of the country. Here, I discuss how 
a missing element in the 1938 minimum wage law has affected its 
course ever since, and how unions’ roles have changed significantly 
as the economy itself has changed.

 Chapter 11: Labor Rising: Unions in the Great Depression 191
Trying to keep pace with 
the minimum wage
Although the Fair Labor Standards Act was amended 11 times from 
its adoption in 1938 through 2008, it never included language that 
would automatically adjust the federal minimum wage to reflect 
increases in the cost of living.
As a result, increases have always been subject to the whims of 
Congress and the president, and the wage has been raised only 
sporadically. From May 1974 to January 1976, for example, it 
increased three times. But from February 1981 to March 1990, and 
again from October 1997 to June 2007, it did not increase at all.
Some other facts and figures regarding the federal minimum wage:
 
✓ Since its inception through 2008, the minimum wage has 
never been enough to lift a family of four above the poverty 
line if only one member of the family works full-time.
 
✓ The $7.25 minimum wage scheduled to go into effect in July 
2009 was less than half the January 2009 average hourly wage 
of $18.49.
 
✓ States can choose to set a minimum wage higher than the 
federal level. As of 2009, 27 states had higher rates than the 
federal government. In addition, more than 100 U.S. cities had 
adopted “living wage” laws that required companies doing 
business with the municipal government to pay “living wages” 
based on the cost of living in the area.
 
✓ As of January 2009, 13 countries had higher minimum wages, 
in U.S. dollars, than the United States.
Arguments for and against a minimum wage have changed little 
since the Great Depression. Proponents contend that minimum 
wage standards reduce poverty and dependence on government 
aid, stimulate the economy, and help close the gaps between the 
poor and rich. Increases in the minimum wage, they argue, are also 
stimulative because they tend to increase other wages.
Opponents insist that raising the minimum wage causes businesses 
to hire fewer workers, reduce their current payrolls, and raise prices. 
They also argue that most minimum wage earners are youths and 
part-time workers whose family incomes are well above the poverty 
line, and therefore increases in the wage don’t help the poor.
Some studies have concluded that there is no clear correlation 
between raising the minimum wage and job loss, or between 
raising the minimum wage and reducing overall poverty levels.

Striving to stay relevant in unions
If the 1930s marked the awkward adolescence of the U.S. labor 
movement, the 21st century could be said to be its faltering old age.
A tectonic shift from an industrial production–based economy to 
one based on services, retail, and information technology combined 
with other factors to steadily reduce the size and influence of 
organized labor in the last half of the 20th century.
At its peak in 1945, union membership encompassed 35 percent 
of working Americans. In 2008, that number was 12.4 percent. The 
public sector far outpaces the private sector in union membership: 
While only 7.6 percent of private-sector workers were union 
members in 2008, 37 percent of government employees were.
 
Not all of the decline in union membership can be attributed to 
a shifting economy or even “globalization.” A study of six other 
industrial countries — France, Japan, Italy, the United Kingdom, 
Canada, and Germany — found that between 1970 and 1990, union 
membership in those countries declined from 37.1 percent to 35.3 
percent, while in the United States the decline was from 30 percent 
to 17.6 percent.
In 2005, several major unions split from the AFL-CIO (a federation 
of unions) to form their own coalition, Change to Win. The unions 
took nearly 25 percent of the AFL-CIO’s membership with them. 
Optimists pointed out that the last time there was a major split 
among labor groups was during the Great Depression, when the 
Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) split from the American 
Federation of Labor (AFL). Overall union membership climbed 
significantly after the split.
And in 2008, the percentage of U.S. workers in unions made its first 
statistically significant increase in 25 years, from 12.1 percent to 
12.4 percent.

during this period; and the unsettled transition from one 
presidency to the other.
I also cover Roosevelt’s New Deal (probably the most 
ambitious package of domestic measures in U.S. history)

O
ne was an orphan who made himself a millionaire and 
became a world-revered humanitarian. The other was born 
rich but had to rebuild his life after being stricken with a crippling 
disease. One was a U.S. president who somewhat unfairly has 
been demonized as a flop in guiding the country during the 
Great Depression. The other was a U.S. president who somewhat 
exaggeratedly has been lionized as a savior during the Great 
Depression.
This chapter looks at Herbert C. Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
the two men who served as president during the period from 
1929 to 1941, and how they handled the challenges of the darkest 
economic time in the country’s history. It also covers their campaign 
against each other in 1932, and how they handled the transition 
from one administration to the other.
“The Great Humanitarian”
A reporter was said to have asked baseball hero Babe Ruth in 1930 
if he thought it was right that at $80,000, Ruth’s annual salary was 
$5,000 more than President Herbert Hoover’s. “Why not?” Ruth 
replied, “I had a better year than he did.”
This possibly apocryphal story reflects the reputation of Herbert 
Clark Hoover, 31st president of the United States, scholar, engineer, 
life-saving humanitarian — and scapegoat of the Great Depression. 
No U.S. president ever accomplished as much before he was in 
the White House — and was so maligned for what he did while in 
office.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
196
 
“Once upon a time,” Hoover was said to have wryly remarked late 
in life, “my political opponents honored me as possessing the 
fabulous intellectual and economic power by which I created a 
worldwide depression all by myself.”
Growing up
Herbert Hoover — his friends called him “Bert” — was born August 
10, 1874, in West Branch, Iowa, making him the first president 
whose birthplace was west of the Mississippi River.
He was part of that generation of Americans who bridged the 
transition from the country’s first century to its second: At the 
time of Hoover’s birth, the Bronx had just become part of New 
York City; a man named Levi Strauss had just received a patent for 
“riveted blue jeans”; and Billy the Kid, at 15, was still just a kid.
By the time Hoover was 8 years old, both of his parents had died, 
and he grew up under the care of an aunt and uncle in Newburg, 
Oregon. He attended a Quaker secondary school his uncle had 
helped found, and then he went to a night school where he studied 
algebra and geometry and developed a love for engineering.
 
In 1891, despite not having graduated from high school, Hoover 
was accepted as an engineering student in the first class of a new 
university in northern California called Stanford. He managed the 
baseball and football teams, and he met and eventually married 
another student named Lou Henry, who was the daughter of an 
Iowa banker. When he graduated in 1895, the 21-year-old Hoover 
had a degree in geology, $40 in his pocket, and no firm prospects.
Striking gold
Hoover landed a job as a clerk with a San Francisco mining firm, 
working his way up to become an engineering assistant. In 1897, 
at the age of 23, Hoover was hired by a British company and sent 
to Australia to supervise the firm’s gold mining operations. By 
the time he left in 1899 for a new assignment as the chief mining 
engineer of the Chinese government, Hoover was making $10,000 
a year from the mines and was on his way to amassing a fortune of 
more than $4 million ($85 million in 2008 dollars).
While in China, Hoover helped organize the successful defense 
of the offices and homes of Western diplomats when a group of 
anti-Western Chinese attacked them in what was known as the 
“Boxer Rebellion.” In November 1901, Hoover moved to London to 
become a partner in the mining firm that had hired him four years 
before.

 Chapter 12: A Tale of Two Presidents 197
With London as a base, Hoover traveled to every continent except 
Antarctica over the next 12 years to oversee various mining projects. 
But in 1914, the outbreak of World War I effectively ended his life in 
mining. Hoover volunteered to help more than 100,000 Americans, 
caught in Europe when the war began, get home.
 
“I did not know it,” he wrote later, “(but) my engineering career 
was over forever. I was on the slippery road of public life.”
Saving lives
When the evacuation of his fellow Americans was finished, 
Hoover became chairman of the Commission for Relief in Belgium. 
The group used private donations to funnel food and supplies to 
German-occupied Belgium. Hoover worked day and night, 
shuttling across the North Sea between Berlin and London to 
convince the Germans to allow the supplies into Belgium and 
overseeing distribution.
 
When the United States entered the war in April 1917, President 
Woodrow Wilson appointed Hoover as head of the American Food 
Administration, responsible for stabilizing domestic food prices, 
ensuring food got where it was needed, and convincing Americans 
to cut food consumption (which he did without having to resort to 
rationing).
After the war, Hoover became chairman of the Allied Food Council 
and the American Relief Administration. The groups managed food 
supplies to war-torn countries, including those of defeated enemies. 
When a British admiral said to Hoover, “young man, I don’t see 
why you American chaps want to feed those bloody Germans,” 
Hoover snapped back, “old man, we can’t understand why you 
British want to starve women and children after they are licked.”
Hoover’s efforts were warmly applauded at home and in other 
countries. He became known as “the Great Humanitarian,” and The 
New York Times named him one of the “ten most important living 
Americans.”
 
“He is certainly a wonder,” said the Assistant Secretary of the 
Navy, who was an admirer of Hoover, in 1920, “and I wish we could 
make him president of the United States. There could not be a 
better one.” The admirer’s name was Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
198
Serving presidents
So well-liked was Hoover in 1920 that both major political parties 
courted him as a possible presidential candidate. He entered the 
California Republican primary election but finished second and 
then threw his support behind the eventual GOP nominee, Ohio 
Senator Warren G. Harding.
 
After Harding’s election, Hoover was appointed Secretary of 
Commerce. With an engineer’s penchant for organization, Hoover 
used the office to increase efficiency by imposing national size and 
dimension standards for everything from bed mattresses to bricks 
to bolts. He pushed for better job safety regulations, promoted 
international trade, and was a cheerleader for home ownership.
Hoover used his humanitarian skills again by overseeing vitally 
needed aid to famine-stricken Russia in 1921 and running relief aid 
to six Southern states in 1927 after huge Mississippi River floods.
In 1923, Harding died and was succeeded as president by Calvin 
Coolidge. Coolidge did not hide the fact he didn’t like Hoover, 
sarcastically referring to him as “Wonder Boy” and once remarking of 
Hoover: “that man has offered me unsolicited advice for six years, 
all of it bad.”
Nonetheless, Coolidge retained Hoover as Commerce secretary, 
in part because of Hoover’s widespread popularity. And when 
Coolidge decided not to run for a second full term as president 
in 1928, he voiced no public objection to Hoover becoming the 
Republican candidate.
Serving as president
Hoover easily defeated his Democratic rival, New York Governor 
Al Smith, in the 1928 presidential race. He assumed the presidency 
brimming with confidence. “I have no fears for the future of our 
country,” he said at his inauguration. “It is bright with hope.”
 
As president, Hoover had ambitious plans for a progressive, 
reform-minded program that would make up for the failure of the 
Harding and Coolidge administrations to do much of anything 
beyond protect the interests of the business community. He 
expanded the civil service system, canceled private oil leases on 
public lands, organized the federal prison system, and planned or 
launched reforms in social service areas such as slum clearance.
But scarcely eight months into his presidency, the U.S. stock market 
crashed, presaging the economic disaster that became the Great 

 Chapter 12: A Tale of Two Presidents 199
Depression. The rest of Hoover’s term was completely dominated by 
trying to fix the financial mess the country found itself in.
It was uncharted territory for a U.S. president. The federal 
government’s role in shepherding the national economy had 
historically been minimal, so Hoover had no blueprints from which 
to come up with a plan that might work. He did, however, try.
His attempts included subsidizing agriculture; cutting taxes; 
increasing taxes; financing public works; making government 
loans to railroads, banks, and other financial institutions; liberalizing 
bank credit; and providing federal aid to stave off mortgage 
foreclosures. He ran up large federal budget deficits in funding 
some of the efforts to right the economy.
 
Hoover’s efforts won some applause. BusinessWeek called his plan 
to shore up sagging banks “the most powerful offensive force that 
government imagination has, so far, been able to command.” The 
New York Times went further: “The president’s course in this 
troublous time has been all that could be desired. No one in his 
place could have done more; very few of his predecessors could 
have done as much.”
A good man, a bad politician
But Hoover’s efforts were hampered by several factors. One was 
that it was hard for him to be enthusiastic about governmental 
actions to which he was philosophically opposed. Hoover believed 
that government’s role in economic matters should be minimal 
and that direct relief in the form of unemployment aid, old age 
pensions, or other subsidies to individuals was not the job of the 
federal government. (See Chapter 5 for more on Hoover’s views 
about direct federal relief to the unemployed and hungry.)
Hoover also suffered from the fact that while he was a very good 
manager, he was a lousy and inexperienced politician. In fact, the 
presidency was his first elective office. “Being a politician is a poor 
profession,” he would later write. “Being a public servant is a noble 
one.” That sentiment ignored the fact that the presidency was a 
political office and sometimes required political skills to build 
consensus, make compromises, and get things done.
 
Finally, Hoover lacked the personality to inspire public confidence 
at a time when the public’s confidence was badly shaken. He was 
somewhat shy and not a good public speaker. When he did talk, he 
sometimes would say patently absurd things, such as suggesting 
that “many persons (had) left their jobs for the more profitable 
one of selling apples” on street corners.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
200
“Hooverisms”
A sure sign that a politician is in trouble is when he becomes the butt of humor, and 
in the Great Depression, Herbert Hoover’s surname was the butt of a lot of bitter 
sarcasm. The slums of shacks and sheds thrown up by homeless people became 
known as “Hoovervilles.” Broken-down cars pulled by mules were “Hoover Carts.” 
Newspapers used as coverings were “Hoover blankets”; empty pockets turned 
inside out were “Hoover flags”; and jack rabbits were “Hoover hogs.”
The crowning indignity for Hoover came after he left office. A giant dam on the lower 
Colorado River that had been named for him was ordered renamed Boulder Dam by 
the Roosevelt administration in 1933. But Hoover got the last laugh on this one: In 
1947, after Roosevelt’s death, Congress renamed the structure Hoover Dam.
Because Hoover wasn’t widely trusted, for example, people continued 
to withdraw their money from banks and stuff it under their mat-
tresses even after Hoover took steps to prop up the financial industry.
Hoover was also seen as elitist and aloof. He dressed formally for 
dinner every evening; smoked 20 expensive Havana cigars a day; 
and declined to visit soup kitchens, bread lines, or any other place 
the poor and needy gathered.
 
His national image as a Scrooge in the White House was cemented 
by the Bonus Army disaster in the summer of 1932 (see Chapter 4 
for details). Many Americans were horrified and angered by press 
accounts and newsreel film of U.S. troops using tanks and bayonets 
against military veterans who had been seeking early payments 
of promised service bonuses. The troops’ commander, General 
Douglas MacArthur, had disobeyed Hoover’s specific directions 
and ordered the attack. Nonetheless, Hoover, who had refused to 
meet with the veterans, was blamed.
Hoover had become so unpopular that an oft-repeated joke at the 
time had the president asking an aide if he could borrow a nickel so 
he could call a friend. “Here’s a dime,” the aide replied, “call both of 
them.” By the time the 1932 presidential election campaign began to 
pick up speed, Hoover was, politically speaking, a dead duck.
The New Dealer
He could not stand unaided, but Americans accorded him the 
longest tenure in office of any U.S. president. He was born to wealth 
and privilege yet was regarded by the down-and-out as a friend to 
the “forgotten man” and by the rich as “a traitor to his class.”

 Chapter 12: A Tale of Two Presidents 201
He was so self-confident that an observer joked “he must have 
been psychoanalyzed by God.” He was so optimistic that an aide 
suggested “he was all light and no darkness.” He was Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States and the 
man often credited with leading the country out of the grip of the 
Great Depression.
Growing up
Franklin Roosevelt was born January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New 
York. His parents were both from wealthy and established families. 
Roosevelt’s ancestors and relatives included passengers on the 
Mayflower and an opium dealer. He was also related by blood 
or marriage to 11 U.S. presidents. One of them, his fifth cousin 
Theodore, became Franklin’s political idol.
Roosevelt was educated at a prestigious private boarding school 
and then graduated from Harvard in only three years. After only 
a year of classes at Columbia University’s law school, Roosevelt 
passed the New York State Bar exam and took a job with a 
prestigious Wall Street law firm.
He also married a distant cousin, Eleanor, and had six children. 
(The marriage was a painful one for Eleanor. Franklin had an affair 
with her social secretary, broke it off, and then resumed the 
affair after being elected president. But Eleanor would throw 
herself into the role of First Lady with zeal and serve as a valuable 
asset to her husband and the country.)
Starting his political career
After a few years practicing law, Roosevelt grew restless. In 1910, 
he began his political career by running as a Democrat for a state 
Senate seat that had been held by Republicans for 26 years. His 
family name and a generally good year for Democrats carried him 
to victory, and he won reelection in 1912.
As a reward for working for the election of Woodrow Wilson to 
the presidency in 1912, Roosevelt was named Assistant Secretary 
of the Navy. He held the post until 1920, all the while building his 
standing within the Democratic Party and his popularity nationally.
In 1920, Roosevelt was picked as the vice presidential running mate 
for Democratic presidential nominee James Cox, the governor of 
Ohio. But the ticket was thrashed by the Republican pair of Warren 
Harding and Calvin Coolidge, and Roosevelt returned to practicing 
law and readying himself for another political campaign.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
202
Losing the use of his legs
In August 1921, Roosevelt was vacationing at the family’s 34-room 
“summer cottage” on Campobello Island in the Canadian province 
of New Brunswick. After a swim, he began running a high fever and 
developed a weakness in his legs that eventually turned to paralysis.
His illness was publicly downplayed by the family and reported 
in the newspapers as everything from a heavy cold to an attack of 
rheumatism. However it was diagnosed in the press, Roosevelt was 
consistently reported to be recovering.
But he wasn’t. At the age of 39, Roosevelt had been stricken with 
what was diagnosed at the time as polio, often referred to as 
“infantile paralysis” because it tended to afflict children more than 
adults. (In 2003, researchers reported that FDR’s disease may have 
been Guillain-Barre Syndrome.)
 
Despite grueling and painful efforts, Roosevelt would never again 
take more than a few halting steps, and then only with the use of 
heavy leg braces. But in the years leading up to his presidency, 
FDR would publicly insist that his condition was improving. He 
never allowed himself to be photographed in his wheelchair or 
being carried, and he usually gave speeches or made other public 
appearances standing upright, supported on one side by someone.
Becoming governor
Throughout the rest of the 1920s, Roosevelt kept up his political 
contacts within the Democratic Party. In 1922, he helped former 
New York Governor Al Smith win the governorship back. In 
1924, Roosevelt made a mesmerizing appearance at the party’s 
presidential nominating convention, giving the nomination speech 
for Smith, who did not win the nomination.
In 1928, Roosevelt again gave the nomination speech for Smith at 
the Democratic National Convention. This time, Smith got the party’s 
nod. Roosevelt, who feared 1928 would be a Republican year, 
did not want to run for anything. But Smith, who wanted FDR’s 
presence on the ticket to help him carry New York, convinced 
Roosevelt to run for governor. Herbert Hoover slaughtered Smith 
in the presidential contest, even carrying New York, but Roosevelt 
won a close race for governor.
As governor, Roosevelt aggressively pushed a program of social 
services. He won legislative approval of a tax break for agricultural 
communities in tough economic straits. He also lobbied for old-age 
pensions funded by workers, employers, and government. “The 

 Chapter 12: A Tale of Two Presidents 203
first duty of a State, and by that I mean government, is to promote 
the welfare of the citizens of that state,” Roosevelt declared.
In 1930, after easily winning reelection, Roosevelt called the 
Legislature into special session and pushed through a $20 million 
unemployment relief plan, the first such program by any state.
With the nation’s economy going into a tailspin and Democrats 
growing hopeful of winning the White House for the first time since 
1916, Roosevelt’s name was increasingly mentioned as a candidate. 
The mentions, however, were not always flattering. The influential 
newspaper columnist Walter Lippmann wrote that Roosevelt was 
“a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the 
office, would very much like to be president.”
Running for president
Although Roosevelt had been considered the favorite in many 
quarters to win the Democratic nomination in 1932, he was not 
universally acclaimed, in part because people were uncertain 
whether he was politically conservative or liberal.
 
“In Franklin Roosevelt we have another Hoover,” said the 
Scripps-Howard newspaper chain. The New Republic magazine 
called him “not a man of great intellectual force or supreme moral 
stamina.” The Nation magazine suggested there was “no evidence 
whatever that people are turning to him as a leader.”
Roosevelt’s leading opponent was Al Smith, his former political 
mentor-turned-bitter rival. Smith won the Massachusetts primary, 
while Representative John Nance Garner of Texas, who was Speaker 
of the House of Representatives, won the California primary.
When the Democrats met in their national convention in Chicago, 
Roosevelt found that he could win the nomination only through 
some wheeling and dealing. After three ballots and no nominee, 
FDR offered the vice presidency to Garner. Garner, known as 
“Cactus Jack,” accepted the offer. California switched its support 
to Roosevelt, and he clinched the nomination.
 
Roosevelt then did something unprecedented in U.S. political 
history. Flying for nine hours through dangerous headwinds from 
New York to Chicago, Roosevelt showed up at the convention to 
accept the nomination in person, starting a practice that was 
followed in future years by other nominees. After his campaign 
theme song, “Happy Days Are Here Again,” was done blaring, 
Roosevelt delivered a crowd-pleasing 4,373-word speech. But it 
was 14 words in the 63rd paragraph that would resonate through 
the rest of the 20th century:

Part IV: Fixing Things  
204
 
“I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American 
people.”
Easy Campaign, Hard Transition
The morning after Roosevelt’s speech accepting the Democratic 
presidential nomination, the phrase “New Deal” dominated 
newspaper headlines across the country.
Neither FDR nor his speechwriter, Sam Rosenman, had any idea 
that the phrase would catch on as much as it did. It may have been 
borrowed from a new book called The New Deal by economics writer 
Stuart Chase or from a New Republic magazine story by Chase 
entitled “A New Deal for America.”
Wherever it came from, the phrase stuck. An editorial cartoon in 
the New York World-Telegram the day after Roosevelt’s speech 
captured the phrase’s appeal. It depicted a farmer looking up at a 
passing airplane, which on its wings bore the words NEW DEAL.
Running to the right
The conservative elements of the Democratic Party weren’t 
quite sure what they had as a candidate. In a speech at Georgia’s 
Oglethorpe University in May 1932, for example, Roosevelt had 
implied no proposal was too far out to try if it had promise.
 
“The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country 
demands bold persistent experimentation,” Roosevelt said. “It 
is common sense to take a method and try it; if it fails, admit it 
frankly and try another. But above all, try something.”
That kind of talk struck some party leaders as being too liberal and 
capable of scaring off voters who were fearful of “radical” ideas.
 
“Tell the governor that he is the boss and we will follow him to hell 
if we have to,” Roosevelt’s running mate, John Nance Garner, told 
a messenger. “But if he goes too far with some of these wild-eyed 
ideas, we are going to get the shit kicked out of us.”
Garner and other doubters, however, underestimated Roosevelt’s 
political skills and his pragmatism. “To accomplish anything 
worthwhile,” he said, “there must be a compromise between the 
ideal and the practical.”

 Chapter 12: A Tale of Two Presidents 205
 
In fact, Roosevelt publicly embraced what was a fairly conservative 
Democratic Party platform. It called for things like a 25 percent cut 
in federal spending and keeping the country on the gold standard, 
which would tend to dry up the money supply and make things 
harder on the poor while protecting the interests of the wealthy.
On the campaign trail, Roosevelt attacked Hoover for “reckless and 
extravagant spending” and running up federal budget deficits. He 
also criticized the incumbent for being “committed to the idea that 
we ought to center control of everything in Washington as rapidly 
as possible.” (Within a year, that statement would ooze irony, as 
Roosevelt would expand the federal government’s role into nearly 
every aspect of American life.)
Campaigning for a lost cause
In the end, it probably wouldn’t have mattered if Roosevelt had 
worn his underwear on his head and delivered speeches in Urdu. 
There was virtually no chance voters were going to reelect Hoover, 
and Hoover knew it. In contrast to the ever-smiling Roosevelt, 
Hoover’s public persona during the campaign ranged from somber 
to dour. His message seemed to give voters a choice between 
FDR’s “new deal” and his own “same old stuff.”
 
“My countrymen,” he said in one speech, “The fundamental issue 
that will fix the national direction for one hundred years to come 
is whether we shall be in fidelity to American tradition, or whether 
we shall turn to innovations.”
Hoover didn’t begin active campaigning until the month before the 
election, and it went badly. People threw eggs and tomatoes at his 
campaign train. He was booed during speeches and greeted with 
signs that read “Down with Hoover” and shouts of “Hang Hoover.” 
Some Republican candidates for other offices stayed as far away 
from the Hoover campaign as they could. The crowning indignity 
may have come in the form of an anonymous telegram to Hoover 
that said: “Vote for Roosevelt. Make it unanimous.”
Winning the White House
As expected, Roosevelt won by a crushing margin. The popular vote 
was 57.2 percent for FDR and 40 percent for Hoover. Roosevelt 
received 472 electoral votes, Hoover just 59. In terms of the 
popular vote, it was the worst defeat ever handed an incumbent 
president.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
206
 
That the country had been ready for a change in the White House 
was obvious. Just what it had changed to, however, was a different 
story. Newspaper editor William Allen White wrote to a relative 
of Roosevelt that he hoped FDR “may develop his stubbornness 
into courage, his amiability into wisdom, his sense of superiority 
into statesmanship. Responsibility is a winepress that drags forth 
strange juices out of men.”
Roosevelt himself had some doubts. On the night of the election, 
he told his son James, “you know Jimmy, all my life I’ve been afraid 
of only one thing — fire. Tonight I think I’m afraid of something 
else . . . I’m just afraid I may not have the strength to do the job . . . 
pray for me, Jimmy.”
Handing off the Great Depression
There was a 116-day gap between the November 8, 1932, election 
and the March 4, 1933, inauguration ceremony, which left Hoover 
in charge as a lame-duck president. Scarcely a week after the 
election, he sent a telegram to Roosevelt, asking to meet. Hoover 
wanted to talk about canceling or modifying European countries’ 
World War I debts to the United States, which was a highly 
unpopular idea with the American public.
Hoover’s motive may have been statesmanlike, but it also may 
have been politically nefarious: The more the two men were seen 
to be working together, the less Hoover might be blamed for what 
was happening. Roosevelt did meet with Hoover at the White 
House on November 22, 1932, and again in January 1933. But FDR 
was wary and refused to commit to anything until he was fully in 
charge.
 
A frustrated Hoover later said he found Roosevelt “amiable, 
pleasant, anxious to be of service, very badly informed and of 
comparatively little vision.” He also referred to him as “a very 
ignorant . . . well-meaning young man,” although Roosevelt was 
only seven years younger than Hoover.
Hoover tried once more to reach some agreement with Roosevelt. 
In mid-February, he sent FDR a ten-page letter (in which he 
misspelled Roosevelt’s last name) warning him that the country’s 
banking system was on the verge of collapse and asking Roosevelt 
to make a public statement on what he intended to do. This time, 
Roosevelt, who was well aware of the banking crisis and had his 
advisors working on a response to it after he was sworn in, ignored 
Hoover’s letter. He later said a secretary had lost it.

 Chapter 12: A Tale of Two Presidents 207
The two men met once more on the night before the inauguration, 
and they rode to the ceremony together (see Figure 12-1), but they 
would part enemies. Hoover lived for 32 years after leaving office, 
dying in 1964 at the age of 90. Asked during his retirement how he 
had handled critics of his role in the Great Depression, he joked, “I 
outlived the bastards.”

Avoiding an assassin’s bullet
In part to relax and in part to dodge Hoover, Roosevelt took a 12-day 
cruise in early February 1933 on a yacht belonging to businessman 
Vincent Astor. On February 15, Roosevelt gave an impromptu 
speech at a bayside park in Miami from the back seat of an open 
car. Just after he finished, a crazed 32-year-old unemployed Italian 
immigrant named Giuseppe Zangara began firing at FDR.
 
Roosevelt was unscathed, but five other people were hit, including 
Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who had been standing on the car’s 
running board while talking to Roosevelt. The president-elect 
ordered Secret Service agents to put Cermak in the car and rush 
to the hospital. Roosevelt cradled the mayor, according to an aide, 
and told him, “Tony, keep quiet — don’t move. It won’t hurt if you 
keep quiet.” Roosevelt was apparently unshaken during and after 
the event. “He had no nerves at all,” marveled one of his advisors.

Cermak died on March 6, two days after Roosevelt’s inauguration. 
Zangara, who pleaded guilty to the shootings, was executed on 
March 20 in Florida’s electric chair.
Taking over
While presidents traditionally drew much of their counsel from 
other politicians or captains of industry, Roosevelt turned to 
academia. His circle of advisors, tagged with the nickname “Brain 
Trust,” included Raymond Moley, a professor of government 
at Columbia University in New York; Rexford Guy Tugwell, a 
Columbia University economist; and Adolf Berle, Jr., a Columbia 
Law School professor.
 
Behind the scenes, Roosevelt’s advisors and other aides were work-
ing on plans to save the country’s crumbling banking system. (For 
more details on FDR’s efforts to save the banks, see Chapter 4.) 
Moley and William Woodin, who would become Roosevelt’s first 
Treasury secretary, met with members of Hoover’s Treasury staff 
to work out details.
Roosevelt, meanwhile, was being told by some people that, if 
necessary, he should seize more power than the presidency had — 
just as the German chancellor, Adolf Hitler, was doing at the time. 
“Even the hand of a national dictator is preferable to a paralyzed 
state,” said Kansas Governor Alf Landon.
 
In his inaugural speech, Roosevelt did say that to get things 
moving, he would seek from Congress “broad executive power 
to wage war against the emergency as great as the power that 
would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign 
foe.” Borrowing a line from the 19th-century American writer 
Henry David Thoreau (“nothing is so much to be feared as fear”), 
Roosevelt also assured the crowd and the millions listening on 
radio that it was his “firm belief that the only thing we have to fear 
is fear itself.”
Like the “new deal” phrase in his nomination acceptance speech, 
the “fear itself” line struck a chord with Americans. But as humorist 
Will Rogers pointed out, Americans were ready to embrace just 
about anything the new president did or said.
“If he (Roosevelt) burned down the Capitol,” Rogers observed, “we 
would cheer and say ‘well, at least he got a fire started somehow.’”

 Chapter 12: A Tale of Two Presidents 209
Lessons Learned
When Americans change presidents, the change is often accompanied 
by a sense of impatience: Why does it take so long for the old 
administration to get out of the way of the new one?
Here’s a look at how the transition, which used to take even longer, 
was changed during the Great Depression, followed by a look at 
how Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama handled the 
hand-off of power during the country’s deepest recession since the 
1930s.
Changing the wait with the 
Twentieth Amendment
Under the original provisions of the U.S. Constitution, a newly 
elected president took office on the March 4 following the 
November general election. The Congress that was elected in 
November waited even longer — 13 months — before taking office.
That meant a new congressman elected in, say, November 1884 
would not take office until December 1885. It also created the 
situation where defeated congressmen would remain in office for 
months, exposing them to the temptation of doing anything they 
wanted without having to fear voter retribution.
The long wait was considered necessary because counting votes 
in the late 18th century could take a long time, and a newly elected 
president would also need time to get his affairs in order and 
travel all the way to the capital. He could then call the Senate into 
a brief special session to confirm his cabinet appointees and spend 
the rest of the year pulling together his administration before the 
Congress convened in December.
 
But the advent of trains and telegraphs, and later airplanes and 
telephones, made the original system hopelessly obsolete. So in 
1932, Congress approved the Twentieth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. The amendment moved the presidential inauguration 
from March 4 to January 20 and the start of the new Congress to 
the January 3 after the November election.
But it took until January 23, 1933, for three-fourths of the country’s 
48 states to ratify the amendment — three days too late to affect 
the 1932 election. That meant Franklin Roosevelt did not take over 
from Herbert Hoover until March 4.

210
Handing off the office from 
Bush to Obama
There were many similarities between the transition from 
President George W. Bush to President Barack Obama following the 
2008 presidential election and the handoff from Herbert Hoover to 
Franklin Roosevelt following the 1932 election.
Both occurred in the midst of severe economic crises. In both 
cases, the banking industry was in shambles, unemployment was 
climbing, people were losing their homes to mortgage foreclosures,
and a popular Democrat was taking over for an unpopular 
Republican.
 
But there was also a key difference. In 1932, Roosevelt had badly 
beaten Hoover after a campaign in which Hoover referred to 
Roosevelt as a “chameleon on plaid” and Roosevelt had called 
Hoover “a fat, timid capon.” These guys really didn’t like each 
other.
In contrast, Obama, whose opponent was Senator John McCain 
of Arizona, criticized the termed-out Bush’s policies during the 
campaign but not Bush personally. Bush likewise refrained from 
personal attacks on Obama.
 
The result was one of the smoother presidential transitions in 
modern U.S. history. Obama made it plain that Bush was president 
until January 20, 2009, and he would not presume to tell him what 
he should do. In return, Bush graciously conferred with Obama on 
key issues during the transition.
It was certainly better than when Bush took over from President 
Bill Clinton in 2001: Incoming Bush aides found that the “W” keys 
had been removed from many of the keyboards in the Executive 
Office Building.

t started at the governmental equivalent of light-speed and 
ended with a world war. In between was the creation of an 
abundance of government programs, a fierce fight with the 
Supreme Court, and new and promising efforts to combat the Great 
Depression rising from old and failed ones.
Put it all together, as this chapter does, and you had the New Deal: 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s attempt to solve an economic 
dilemma bigger than any the United States had ever seen.
In addition to looking at both phases of the New Deal, this chapter 
examines FDR’s quarrel with an uncooperative Supreme Court 
and assesses the immediate effects the administration’s programs 
had on the Great Depression, as well as their lasting impact on the 
country.
Starting Fast: The First 100 Days
On the morning after he was sworn in as president, Roosevelt had 
himself wheeled into the Oval Office, only to find that there were 
no pencils or paper in the desk and no buzzer to summon aides. 
Roosevelt took a deep breath and began bellowing for a secretary. 
Then he got to work on what would be forever known as the New 
Deal.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
212
The first order of business was assessing just how big a mess the 
nation’s banking system was in. Roosevelt ordered all banks closed 
so federal regulators could see which ones were sound enough to 
be allowed to reopen. Within a week, FDR had pushed an emergency 
banking bill through Congress. (For details on the banking crisis 
and Roosevelt’s response to it, see Chapter 4.)
The swiftness of Roosevelt’s action on the banking crisis 
impressed even those who had been less than impressed by him 
as a candidate. The influential columnist Walter Lippman, who 
had criticized FDR in 1932 for lacking leadership qualities, wrote 
in March 1933 that “in one week, the nation, which had lost 
confidence in everything and everybody, regained confidence in 
the government and in itself.”
 
The new president was just getting warmed up. In the first 100 
days after taking office, the Roosevelt administration and Congress 
crafted more than a dozen major pieces of legislation, all of them 
designed to shore up, patch, revive, or jumpstart some aspect of 
the national economy. Some historians have labeled the period the 
busiest three months in congressional history.
 
“The special session of the 73rd Congress has hung up an amazing 
record of achievement in its 14-week setting,” said Time magazine 
in June 1933. “It was President Roosevelt’s do-or-die attack against 
the Depression.”
It often was not the most organized of attacks. One of FDR’s top 
aides, Raymond Moley, once joked that saying Roosevelt’s New Deal 
was planned was like saying a boy’s room strewn with chemistry 
sets and dirty clothes was the work of an interior decorator.
In one instance, Harry Hopkins, FDR’s top aide, and Frances 
Perkins, Roosevelt’s Secretary of Labor, huddled under the stairs 
of a women’s club in New York City to draft plans for an emergency 
relief program. In another case, Hopkins suggested during lunch 
with Roosevelt that the country needed a public works program 
to provide temporary employment. Within a week, the plan was 
up and running under Hopkins’s charge, and within a month it had 
created jobs for 2.6 million people.
 
When a program didn’t work — and plenty of them didn’t — the 
president and his people plucked out its best elements, melded 
them into a new program, and forged ahead.

 Chapter 13: Roosevelt’s New Deal 213
In addition, Roosevelt sometimes shot from the hip when it came 
to picking advisors. For example, his Secretary of the Interior, 
Harold Ickes, was FDR’s third choice for the job, behind two U.S. 
senators who turned him down. Ickes was a Republican, as were 
several of Roosevelt’s advisors, and had never met the president 
when he was appointed Interior secretary. Ickes would become 
one of FDR’s most important aides and serve him in various 
capacities for 13 years.
 
“Roosevelt is an explorer who has embarked on a voyage as 
uncertain as that of Columbus,” said the British statesman Winston 
Churchill, “and upon a quest which might conceivably be as 
important as the discovery of the New World.”
An alphabet soup of achievements
Many men in Congress shared Roosevelt’s thirst for swift action. 
More than half of the two houses’ 531 members had first been 
elected in 1930 or 1932; they were sent to Washington with voter 
expectations that they would do something to knock down the 
Great Depression. Other congressional members were dazzled by 
FDR’s jaunty confidence or impressed by his enormous popularity. 
Whatever the reason, most of them voted the way the president 
wanted, most of the time.
Here’s a look at some of the programs that emerged from what 
became known as The Hundred Days.
The Emergency Banking Act
After 35 minutes of debate, Congress passed a measure that gave 
Roosevelt broad authority over U.S. currency and credit and 
approved the printing of $2 billion to pump up banks’ assets. See 
Chapter 4 for more on the measure.
The Economy Act
A master politician, Roosevelt loved to “zig” just when his opponents 
expected to him to “zag.” So while many conservatives expected 
him to run up the federal government’s debts for a sheaf of social 
programs, Roosevelt instead pushed for saving $500 million by 
cutting pensions to military veterans and reducing salaries for 
federal workers — including members of Congress. “For three long 
years,” FDR scolded, “the federal government has been on the road 
to bankruptcy.”

Part IV: Fixing Things  
214
The bill passed over the protests of many Democrats in Congress 
but with support from many Republicans.
The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
Of all the New Deal’s projects and programs, this was the one 
closest to Roosevelt’s heart. It established a system of camps for 
young men who worked in conservation programs throughout the 
country’s national parks and wild lands. For more details on the 
CCC, see Chapter 8.
The Federal Emergency Relief Act (FERA)
One of the most pressing problems faced by the Roosevelt 
administration was helping Americans who literally were on the 
edge of starvation. In May 1933, Congress passed a bill creating the 
Federal Emergency Relief Administration, and Roosevelt put his 
top aide, Harry Hopkins, in charge. The program started with $500 
million, half of which was passed out to states on a matching basis: 
one federal dollar for every three state dollars. The other half was 
designated to go where it was most immediately needed or where 
the matching fund requirement could not be met.
 
Even before he had a desk in his office, Hopkins had approved $5 
million in grants to six states. He and his small staff alternately 
coaxed, cajoled, coerced, and threatened local agencies to funnel 
the funds to the needy as fast as possible. Before the program 
was absorbed into another New Deal program in 1935, FERA 
handed out $3 billion (about $48.2 billion in 2008 dollars) to needy 
Americans.
The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA)
At the same time that FERA was being launched, Congress 
approved a bold program designed to prop up the prices that 
farmers could get for their crops and livestock by paying them not 
to plant or raise so much. Take a look at Chapter 6 for more details 
on the AAA.
The Emergency Farm Mortgage Act 
and Home Owners’ Loan Act
Both measures were designed to provide funds and lending 
mechanisms that could help people stave off mortgage foreclosures 
and, in some cases, reverse foreclosures that had already 
occurred. By 1935, one-fifth of all farm mortgages had been 
refinanced. The homeowners’ program provided loans of up to 
$14,000 at 5 percent interest. By 1936, the program had made 
1 million loans totaling $3 billion.

 Chapter 13: Roosevelt’s New Deal 215
In 1934, well after the end of The Hundred Days, Congress 
approved the National Housing Act. The act created the Federal 
Housing Administration, which insured home mortgages and set 
up national standards for construction quality and home loans, 
such as 20 percent down payments for a 20-year mortgage.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
The TVA was notable among New Deal programs in that it was 
designed to make people’s lives better in the future — not just to 
meet an immediate need.
After the United States entered World War I in 1917, the federal 
government built a dam on the Tennessee River at Muscle Shoals, 
Alabama. The dam’s purpose was to provide cheap hydroelectric 
power for a plant to manufacture munitions.
But the war ended before the plant was built, and for the next 16 
years Congress debated what to do with the dam. Some wanted 
to sell the project to private interests. Others — most particularly 
Senator George Norris of Nebraska — crusaded for federal 
development of the area. With the election of Roosevelt, Norris 
at last had the powerful ally he needed to realize his quest.
 
As approved by Congress, the TVA was a seven-state (Tennessee, 
Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and 
Mississippi) organization charged with producing low-cost electricity, 
developing local manufacturing, enhancing the navigability of the 
river, providing flood protection, and “improving the economic 
and social well-being of the people living in said river basin.”
By 1940, 21 TVA hydroelectric plants had been completed, providing 
electric power to tens of thousands of poor rural families who had 
never had electricity. Many of the project’s other goals, such as 
flood protection, were also reached.
 
“Ten thousand men are at work, building with timber and steel 
and concrete the New Deal’s most magnificent project, creating an 
empire with potentialities so tremendous and so dazzling that they 
make one gasp,” federal investigator Lorena Hickok wrote in June 
1934. “There’s a chance to create a new kind of industrial life, with 
decent wages, decent housing. Gosh, what possibilities! You can’t 
feel very sorry for Tennessee when you see that in the offing.”
Truth in Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act
Not long after the stock market crashed in late 1929, the Senate 
Banking Committee began looking into just what had happened. 
Senators listened to tale after tale of legally dubious and morally 
reprehensible practices by more than a few bankers and brokers.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
216
 
In May 1933, Congress approved the Truth in Securities Act: a 
measure that required every new stock issuance to be registered 
with the Federal Trade Commission and fully disclosed in detail. 
A year later, the Securities Exchange Act extended the rules to all 
stocks, required the disclosure of insider trading, authorized the 
Federal Reserve to set margin rates (see Chapter 2), and created 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the 
market.
The Glass-Steagall Act
 
This measure basically prohibited commercial banks from risking 
their solvency by dabbling in the securities markets. It also created 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which guaranteed 
personal bank deposits up to $2,500 and was funded by premiums 
paid by member banks. (See Chapter 4 for more details on the 
FDIC.)
Roosevelt wasn’t crazy about the act because he thought it would 
prove to be too large an undertaking for the federal government. 
But he signed it anyway.
“The most far-reaching legislation 
ever enacted”
After taking over in March 1933, the Roosevelt administration 
moved swiftly to shore up two of the economy’s main pillars: 
banking and agriculture. On June 16, the last of The Hundred Days, 
Roosevelt signed a bill addressing a third pillar: industry.
The bill was entitled the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), 
and Roosevelt somewhat grandiosely called it “the most important 
and far-reaching legislation ever enacted by the American 
Congress.”
There were two main parts to the act:
 
✓ One part relaxed antitrust laws, in return for which industries 
were supposed to huddle up their members and draft 
workplace standards that would ensure workers a fair wage 
and decent hours, consumers a fair price, and companies a 
fair profit. This provision was to be governed by the National 
Recovery Administration, headed by a hard-drinking ex-cavalry 
man named General Hugh “Iron Pants” Johnson. There was 
also a section that guaranteed employees a right to organize 
and bound industries to minimum wages, maximum workweeks, 
and the abolition of child labor (see Chapter 11 for details on 
this part of the NIRA).

 Chapter 13: Roosevelt’s New Deal 217
 
✓ The second part of the act created the Public Works 
Administration (PWA). The PWA was given $3.3 billion and 
charged, under the direction of Interior Secretary Harold 
Ickes, to spend it on public works projects that would create 
jobs and fill needs around the country.
To pay for the measure, Roosevelt adroitly set up a fiscal plan 
outside the normal federal budget. The plan essentially borrowed 
money from the public and repaid it with higher taxes on 
corporations and dividends and a tax hike on gasoline.
 
While signing the NIRA, Roosevelt declared that “it represents a 
supreme effort to stabilize for all time the many factors which 
make for the prosperity of the nation.”
He was right about the effort part. General Johnson, lacking the 
authority to force industry compliance, settled on a dual strategy 
of convincing industry leaders it was a privilege to be a part of the 
team and threatening them with consumer boycotts if they didn’t 
join.
Johnson staged mammoth parades and demonstrations in support 
of the program. He sketched a blue eagle clutching a cogwheel and 
a sheaf of lightning bolts. The symbol was to be displayed by all 
companies that were part of the NIRA.
 
“While every American housewife understands that the blue eagle 
on everything that she permits to come into her home is a symbol 
of (her home’s) restoration to security,” Johnson said, “may God 
have mercy on the man or group of men who attempt to trifle with 
this bird.”
Initial cooperation was encouraging. More than 2 million employ-
ers signed up, including most of the heavy hitters in major 
industries. (Henry Ford was a notable exception.) But eventually 
Johnson’s cheerleading efforts wore thin. Many industries seized 
the opportunity to fix prices — at increased levels — but weren’t 
as enthusiastic about abiding by fair labor standards.
Big companies in each industry dominated the drafting of industry 
codes, so the needs of smaller firms were generally ignored. 
Price-fixing kept prices high while discouraging incentive for 
expansion, which in turn meant little or no increase in new jobs.
In addition, some key industries, such as agriculture, were not 
included. And paperwork for the program was crushing: More than 
10,000 pages of rules and regulations governed the NIRA.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
218
 
The Public Works Administration fared somewhat better. 
Administrator Harold Ickes was notoriously tight-fisted and 
released money for projects slowly. He also hated make-work 
projects, and he refused to “hire men to chase tumbleweeds on 
windy days.”
Home-building efforts by the PWA were fiercely opposed by real 
estate and construction lobbies and were generally unsuccessful. 
But in its six years in existence, the PWA did spend $6 billion on 
more than 34,000 projects that covered parts of virtually every 
county in the United States. The projects included building aircraft 
carriers for the Navy, post offices, courthouses, and more than 70 
percent of the public schools built between 1933 and 1939. The 
PWA built the Triborough Bridge in New York City, the Grand 
Coulee Dam in Washington, and the Port of Brownsville in Texas. 
Just as importantly, it employed more than 500,000 people per year.
No one likes relief: The Civil 
Works Administration
With generations-old traditions of self-reliance and individualism 
imbued in them, most Americans hated the idea of making or 
accepting handouts, even from the federal government.
 
That included Roosevelt. When he signed the Federal Emergency 
Relief Act in May 1933, FDR made it clear that he viewed it as a dire 
necessity and not a permanent solution. “President Roosevelt is 
not ‘relief minded,’” wrote journalist Gertrude Springer. “He sees 
relief as a necessary evil to be got rid of at the earliest possible 
date.”
His “deputy president,” Harry Hopkins, shared the president’s 
views. “I don’t think anybody can go year after year, month after 
month, accepting relief without affecting his character in some way 
unfavorably,” Hopkins wrote in June 1933. “It is probably going to 
undermine the independence of hundreds of thousands of families.”
So in October 1933, Hopkins suggested to FDR that the government 
put the unemployed to work over the winter on temporary public-
works jobs. Roosevelt agreed, redirected money from the Public 
Works Administration, and put the peripatetic Hopkins in charge.
The program was called the Civil Works Administration (CWA), 
and it was hugely popular. In one town, 2,000 people showed up 
for 155 jobs. In North Carolina, the number of applicants reached 
150,000 in one week. The CWA was also popular with state 
governments, which could hand off projects to it. “This civil works 

 Chapter 13: Roosevelt’s New Deal 219
program is one of the soundest, most constructive policies of your 
administration,” Kansas Governor Alf Landon wrote to Roosevelt, 
“and I cannot urge too strongly its continuance.”
Within a month, the CWA had hired 2.6 million people at wages 
from 40 cents to $1 an hour. Within two months, there were 
4 million people working. Much of the work was meaningful. The 
CWA renovated 300,000 miles of roads and 40,000 schools, and it 
built 150,000 “privies” in the South.
 
But some of the jobs were pure make-work. People were hired to 
hold balloons outside public buildings to frighten starlings. Others 
were hired to count dogs. A word that had heretofore been used to 
describe idle cowboys braiding scraps of leather to kill time came 
to describe some of the CWA jobs: boondoggle.
By the spring of 1934, criticism of the program for not creating 
enough jobs, pressure from businesses that didn’t like the 
competition, and fears that it would become hard to wean people 
off federal jobs spurred the administration to abandon the CWA.
Starting the Second New Deal
By the end of 1934, the Roosevelt administration’s efforts had won 
widespread public approval. Roosevelt himself — and by extension 
the Democratic Party — was immensely popular. Democrats 
picked up 22 more House and Senate seats in the 1934 election, 
and Roosevelt was lionized in some of the press. “No president in 
so short a time has inspired so much hope,” wrote The New York 
Times.
Forty-one popular songs were written about FDR. Under Herbert 
Hoover, the White House had received on average about 80 letters 
a day. Under Roosevelt, the number reached 50,000 on some days. 
Many people wrote to thank Roosevelt.
 
“Dear Mr. President,” read one letter, “this is just to tell you that 
everything is all right now. The man you sent found our house all 
right, and we went down to the bank with him and the mortgage 
can go on for awhile longer . . . you remember I wrote you about 
losing the furniture too. Well, your man got it back for us. I never 
heard of a president like you.”
There were more quantifiable measurements of the New Deal’s 
success too. Unemployment had dropped by 2 million, and the 
gross domestic product was up.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
220
But there was also no shortage of statistics that suggested the 
programs had not done enough. For example, 10 million people 
were still out of work in 1935. And there was no shortage of critics. 
Individuals such as Father Charles Coughlin and Senator Huey 
Long of Louisiana hammered Roosevelt, as did groups on the left 
and right of the political spectrum. (See Chapter 9 for more on 
FDR’s critics.)
 
So Roosevelt recalibrated his efforts. Never a fan of federal spending, 
FDR nonetheless decided to run up bigger budget deficits to 
expand federal aid programs. He became more confrontational 
with big business and pushed for tax increases on the wealthy 
(known as “soak the rich” taxes) and the closing of tax loopholes. 
But at the same time he embraced positions favored by those on 
the political left, he also decided to steer federal aid away from 
direct relief programs.
“The federal government must and shall quit this business of 
relief,” he told Congress in January 1935. “We must preserve not 
only the bodies of the unemployed from destruction, but also their 
self-respect, their self-reliance and courage and determination.”
Generating jobs through the Works 
Progress Administration
In January 1935, Roosevelt’s right-hand man, Harry Hopkins, told 
Congress that if it would allocate the money, the federal government 
would put millions of Americans to work on public works projects 
all over the country. (A senator once asked Hopkins if such 
programs were wise “in the long run,” to which Hopkins retorted: 
“People don’t eat in the long run, senator, they eat every day.”)
 
In April, Congress complied, and the Works Progress Administration 
(WPA) was begun, under the auspices of Hopkins. The WPA was a 
far more ambitious program than previous federal jobs efforts. Over 
its eight-year run, the program spent $11 billion (about $170 billion 
in 2008 dollars) and created 8 million jobs.
The variety of jobs was impressive. The administration oversaw 
projects from excavating and preserving Native American burial 
grounds to putting on Shakespeare’s Macbeth with an all–African 
American cast. Like other programs, the WPA did a lot of public 
works construction. Its workers built 110,000 public schools, 
libraries, post offices, courthouses, and government office 
buildings. They constructed 100,000 bridges and 600 airports, 
and they paved 500,000 miles of roads and highways.

 Chapter 13: Roosevelt’s New Deal 221
 
The WPA also provided jobs in areas where other public works 
projects had never ventured. Writers, singers, artists, and 
actors were employed to write, sing, paint, sculpt, and act. 
Photojournalists were hired to document the era. When asked if 
those kinds of jobs were the wisest investment for taxpayer 
dollars, Hopkins shrugged and said “hell, they’ve got to eat, just 
like other people.”
Like almost all of the New Deal’s programs, the WPA was widely 
criticized from the right and left. Liberals decried its policy of 
allowing women and minorities to be paid less than white men. 
Conservatives scoffed that WPA stood for “We Poke Along” and 
charged that by guaranteeing the wages of workers, the program 
eliminated any incentive for them to excel. The WPA was also 
criticized for being too expensive because its construction costs 
were often higher than private construction.
In 1939, a nationwide poll asked Americans what they liked best 
and what they liked least about the New Deal. The answer in both 
cases was the WPA.
Establishing Social Security
While governor of New York, Roosevelt had explored the idea 
of a government-run insurance system that would provide some 
security for senior citizens after they left the labor force. It would 
also provide a backstop for unemployed people and the dependents 
of workers who died suddenly. As president, Roosevelt approached 
the subject cautiously, waiting until the time seemed right to push 
the idea.
That time seemed to come in 1934. Americans were becoming 
increasingly enamored with the idea of a government-run old age 
pension plan. Much of the interest was stirred by an eccentric 
California doctor named Francis Townsend, who had proposed 
a simple-sounding but economically nutty pension system. (See 
Chapter 9 for more on Townsend and his plan.)
“The Congress can’t stand the pressure of the Townsend Plan 
unless we have a real old-age insurance system,” Roosevelt told 
his labor secretary, Frances Perkins, “nor can I face the country” 
without an alternative plan.
 
Roosevelt named an “Economic Security” committee to come up 
with a plan, and in January 1935 he asked Congress to approve 
the creation of a pension system. It would be paid for in part by 
employers and in part by a payroll tax deducted from wages,

starting in 1937. To build up a reserve, the first payments would 
not be made until 1942. Provisions were also made for lump-sum 
payments to survivors of workers who died and for aid to children 
whose parents died or were unable to work.
Despite furious protests from conservative newspapers and others 
that the plan smelled of socialism, Congress rather easily approved 
it, and Roosevelt signed it in August 1935.
The plan had several serious flaws. For one thing, it excluded large 
groups of workers, particularly those dominated by women and 
minorities, such as domestic help and farm labor. For another, it 
was a regressive tax, meaning that low-wage earners paid the same 
rates as high-wage earners, and the tax applied only to the first 
$3,000 of income.
But even with its flaws, the Social Security Act would prove to be 
one of the most important legacies of the New Deal. Even detractors 
were impressed by how quickly and efficiently the act’s programs 
were put into place amid a blizzard of paperwork. Figure 13-1 
shows a government ad promoting the program.

 Chapter 13: Roosevelt’s New Deal 223
Feuding with the Supreme Court
While Roosevelt generally had his way with Congress during his 
first term, he was not so fortunate with the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Dominated by elderly conservative justices (one was 80 years 
old, five were in their 70s, and none were under 60), the court 
overturned several key components of the New Deal.
In a 1935 case that pitted the federal government against a kosher 
poultry business from Brooklyn, the court ruled that in approving 
the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), Congress had delegated 
power to the executive branch in ways “utterly inconsistent with 
the constitutional prerogatives and duties of Congress.”
The Court also overturned the Roosevelt administration’s key 
piece of farming legislation, the Agricultural Adjustment Act. And 
it threw out a minimum wage law enacted by the state of New 
York, threatening the administration’s plans for a federal minimum 
wage law.
 
The court’s rulings infuriated Roosevelt, who referred to the 
justices as relics of “the horse and buggy age.” In February 1937, 
FDR proposed to Congress that he be allowed to appoint a federal 
judge for every judge that refused to retire after he reached 70. 
The “court packing” ploy would have raised the number of justices 
on the Supreme Court from 9 to 15.
 
“We have . . . reached a point as a nation where we must take 
action to save the Constitution from the court and the court from 
itself,” Roosevelt explained in a radio fireside chat. “We must find a 
way to take an appeal from the Supreme Court to the Constitution 
itself.”
Most Americans didn’t buy into the idea. “As an American who is 
a lover of liberty, I cry out against your wicked proposal,” wrote 
the owner of a Cleveland fruit packing company, “to undermine the 
American institution by packing the Supreme Court, thus making it 
a puppet under yourself.”
Congress eventually rejected the idea. The proposal, however, 
apparently got the attention of the court. Even before Congress 
voted the plan down, justices began handing down decisions that 
upheld New Deal programs that included the Social Security Act, 
minimum wage laws, labor union organizing rights, and farm 
legislation. Moreover, most of the court’s justices retired, allowing 
Roosevelt to name their successors.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
224
But the fight left Roosevelt with a political black eye from which 
he did not fully recover. Republicans made substantial gains in 
the 1938 elections, which, combined with the country’s entry into 
World War II, generally marked the end of the New Deal.
Assessing the New Deal
Did the New Deal end the Great Depression? No. Did it help end 
it? Probably not. Did it make things more palatable for Americans 
living through the period? Probably. Did it have a deep and lasting 
impact on the United States? Absolutely.
 
That the New Deal hadn’t cured the country’s economic blues was 
obvious as early as 1937. True, the national annual income had 
climbed from $40 billion in 1932 to $72 billion. But after being 
re-elected in 1936, Roosevelt had decided that inflation was 
enough of a threat that it was time to rebalance the federal budget. 
That meant cutting back on New Deal programs such as the Works 
Progress Administration.
When federal spending dipped, so did the economy. Unemployment 
went back up, from 14 percent to almost 19 percent between 1937 
and 1938. Steel, automobile, and other industries’ production fell, 
and Roosevelt and Congress responded with a $5 billion spending 
program that helped start the economy upward again by 1939. But 
combined with earlier spending efforts, the boost meant that by 
1940, the national debt had nearly doubled from the $22.5 billion it 
had been when Roosevelt took office. Unemployment remained at 
an unhealthily high 17 percent.
Many, if not most, historians believe that it wasn’t until the country 
began cranking up its production of war materials that the United 
States finally shook off the icy grip of the Great Depression. (This 
belief has led to the wry observation that maybe German dictator 
Adolf Hitler did more to end the Great Depression than did 
Roosevelt.)
The New Deal did succeed in giving Americans hope during the 
depression’s darkest days. That fact was reflected during the 1940 
presidential election, in which Americans gave Roosevelt some-
thing no president before him had been given: a third term.
 
But the real impact of the New Deal went far beyond programs 
designed to counter a temporary, if lengthy, economic recession. 
It created the template for much of the modern U.S. political and 
governmental system.

 Chapter 13: Roosevelt’s New Deal 225
 
In the late 1920s, President Calvin Coolidge had noted with no 
small degree of accuracy that “if the federal government should go 
out of existence, the common run of people would not detect the 
difference in the affairs of their daily lives for a considerable length 
of time.”
By the late 1930s, that statement was no longer true. For good or 
ill, the New Deal firmly established the federal government as the 
preeminent player in public life:
 
✓ It laid the foundation for the modern safety net of social 
services.
 
✓ It cemented the federal government’s role in regulating the 
economy.
 
✓ It popularized the idea that the federal government had a duty 
to provide security for those on the margins of society.
 
✓ It fostered the development of the modern labor movement.
 
✓ It made the government a leading player in U.S. agriculture.
And the New Deal also forged the coalition of interests that formed 
the core of the Democratic Party for the rest of the 20th century 
and into the 21st.
Lessons Learned
The New Deal instituted a host of federal government safeguards 
that ranged from the minimum wage to stock market regulations, 
and from insured bank deposits to agricultural product price 
supports. Here’s a look at one of the New Deal’s biggest legacies — 
Social Security — and an area it left largely untouched — health 
care.
Paying for Social Security
In January 2008, a 62-year-old Maryland woman named Kathleen 
Casey-Kirschling received a check from the Social Security 
Administration. What made her check unique was that it was 
thought to be the first paid to one of the baby boomers: the 
estimated 80 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964.
The cost of covering Social Security benefits for all the baby 
boomers to follow Casey-Kirschling is the biggest worry faced by 
the system in the 21st century.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
226
 
Since its inception, the Social Security system was on a pay-as-
you-go basis: Current workers paid for the benefits being collected 
by someone else. Surplus funds were put into a trust account to 
cover any shortfalls.
The system worked well enough until the mid-1970s, when 
Congress decided to tie Social Security benefits to increases in the 
cost of living, with the expectation that payroll taxes to fund the 
system would keep pace as wages increased. But between 1978 
and 1982, inflation soared by 60 percent while wages didn’t grow at 
all. The result was that Social Security experts predicted the fund 
would be running in the red and forced to dip into reserves within 
a year or two.
In 1982, President Ronald Reagan and Congress agreed to close the 
gap by increasing payroll taxes and gradually raising the minimum 
age for full Social Security benefits from 65 to 67.
 
In the fiscal year that ended in September 2008, the government 
collected $785 billion in payroll taxes from approximately 163 
million workers to finance $585 billion in benefits for 50 million 
pensioners. And the trust fund had assets of approximately $2.2 
trillion.
But critics of the system point out that while there were 42 workers 
making payments into the system for every pensioner at the end of 
World War II, there were only about three workers per pensioner 
in 2008. And as the baby boomers age, the gap is expected to close 
to two-to-one. The system is projected to begin running a deficit in 
2016.
In addition, critics say, the trust fund consists of assets that amount 
to little more than IOUs from the federal government, which routinely 
uses surplus payroll tax revenues for other government operations. 
Defenders of the system say such criticism is nonsense because all 
government bonds are essentially IOUs, and the U.S. government 
backs the special bonds held by the trust fund as it does all 
government bonds.
But both sides of the debate agree that by the middle of the 21st 
century, adjustments will be needed to allow the system to cover 
its obligations. Those adjustments could be further changes in the 
minimum retirement age, increased payroll tax rates, or lowered 
benefits.

 Chapter 13: Roosevelt’s New Deal 227
Closing the New Deal’s health gap
Several of President Roosevelt’s top aides wanted to include health 
insurance in the Social Security Act. But “here,” according to a 
September 1935 story in The Nation magazine, “the reactionary 
American Medical Association got busy at once and succeeded in 
suppressing any suggestion for health insurance.”
Roosevelt decided the idea was too controversial and would put 
the whole bill at risk, so he delegated it to the political limbo of 
“further study.” There it languished for 30 years. Roosevelt’s 
successor, Harry Truman, asked Congress for the establishment of 
a national health insurance plan. Truman’s request went nowhere, 
and the focus of reformers shifted from covering everyone to 
covering only those eligible for Social Security coverage.
 
In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the 
establishment of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Medicare 
extended government-sponsored health coverage to Americans 
aged 65 and older. Medicaid provided coverage for those receiving 
other safety-net services, such as welfare and aid to children, the 
blind, and the disabled. Medicaid went into effect on January 1, 
1966, and Medicare six months later.
In 1993, President Bill Clinton pushed a massive overhaul of the 
nation’s healthcare system, which had become plagued by soaring 
costs, confusing programs, and decreasing accessibility to the 
unemployed and uninsured. But the medical and insurance 
industries squashed the effort. In 2003, President George W. Bush 
signed into law a major change in Medicare that created new 
prescription benefits and other changes.
In 2009, President Barack Obama pledged to seek a universal 
health insurance system that included elements such as the choice 
of doctors, protection against financial catastrophe, lower cost 
growth, and improved patient safety.

Lessons Learned from the 
Great Depression
In This Chapter
▶ Recapping the Great Depression
▶ Summarizing the post–World War II economy
▶ Defining the differences between 1929 and 2009
▶ Putting the lessons of the Great Depression to work
T
he Great Depression ended roughly with the beginning of 
World War II. Ever since, it has been the comparative for every 
burp or bump to come along in the U.S. economy. Nothing like it 
has occurred in the seven subsequent decades. But could an 
economic disruption as cataclysmic as the Great Depression 
happen again?
This chapter addresses that question by first summarizing what 
happened to the U.S. economy between late 1929 and 1941, and 
then looking at how the economy has fared since the end of World 
War II. I consider the similarities and differences between the Great 
Depression and the recession that began in late 2007. And the 
chapter concludes with how the lessons from the Great Depression 
apply to the modern world.
An Overview of the 
Great Depression
As I point out in Chapter 4, economists and historians have argued 
for decades about what the precise cause (or causes) of the Great 
Depression was (or were). It’s not just an academic argument.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
230
 
Knowing what caused the Great Depression to happen could be 
vitally important in knowing how best to prevent it from happening 
again. With that in mind, following are summaries of some of the 
causes and some of the consequences of the Great Depression.
Creating an economic disaster
What do most historians and economists blame for the economic 
meltdown that was the Great Depression? Here are the most 
commonly mentioned culprits.
An overabundance of available credit
The development and widespread use of credit to purchase 
big-ticket consumer items such as cars and refrigerators greatly 
increased consumer debt in the decade prior to the start of the 
Great Depression. Consumer debt rose from $2.6 billion in 1920 to 
$7.1 billion in 1929, a 173 percent increase. When hard times hit, 
many people found themselves not only short of cash but saddled 
with debts they couldn’t pay. That situation caused trouble not 
only for them but also for the people to whom they owed money.
A big disparity in the distribution of wealth
Although the 1920s were, overall, a decade of prosperity, the 
wealth was by no means evenly shared. While the average worker’s 
wages went up only 9 percent, the incomes of the wealthiest 
1 percent of Americans soared 75 percent. Much of that wealth 
was put into luxury items that created few jobs, or into speculative 
investments that added very little to the economy.
Speculation in the stock market
Although relatively few Americans were directly invested in the 
market, it nonetheless sucked up a good deal of capital, which 
drove stock prices far beyond any grounding in real value. The 
price bubble was inflated on investors’ expectations that someone 
would pay more for the securities than they did. Then the bubble 
burst in late October 1929, and hardly any buyers could be found.
A shaky financial industry
Many of the country’s banks were underfunded, overextended, too 
deep in speculative investments, and not very well regulated (if 
they were regulated at all).
Too much stuff
By the end of the 1920s, the country was producing an estimated 
17 percent more than it could buy. When the economy slowed 

 Chapter 14: Lessons Learned from the Great Depression 231
down in the wake of the stock market crash, manufacturers with 
big inventories on their hands shut down production and laid off 
workers, which stifled consumption even more.
Prescribing the wrong economic medicine
Faced with a massive — and growing — crisis, the federal govern-
ment took steps that were either wrong or too feeble. These steps 
included the Federal Reserve Board raising interest rates to stifle 
speculation, only to have the action restrict the supply of money 
at the wrong time. President Herbert Hoover and Congress also 
approved a sizeable tax increase to pay down the federal budget 
deficit, which also shrank the money supply. And they approved a 
trade tariff that led to an international trade war.
Dealing with the consequences
Whatever the leading causes of the Great Depression, the 
consequences were pretty evident — and devastating:
 
✓ Private capital investment fell from $35 billion in 1929 to $3.9 
billion in 1933. Adjusted for inflation, the gross domestic 
product dropped 25 percent between 1929 and 1933, and the 
national income dropped 50 percent.
 
✓ More than 6,000 banks failed, taking $2 billion in depositors’ 
money with them. Lending came virtually to a halt.
 
✓ Unemployment reached a peak of 24.9 percent in 1933. Many 
families had only one wage earner, which meant that 30 percent 
to 40 percent of Americans had no regular income at all.
 
✓ About 300,000 businesses failed between 1929 and 1933 — 
approximately 14 percent of all the businesses in the country.
 
✓ In 1933, home foreclosures were running at 1,000 per day. By 
the beginning of 1934, half of the residential mortgages in the 
country were in arrears.
 
✓ The economic miseries in the United States both complemented 
and exacerbated the problems in other countries, ensuring 
that the Great Depression would be global in its reach.
 
✓ Between September 1929 and July 1932, the Dow Jones stock 
index, a weighted average of 30 major companies’ stock 
prices, fell 89 percent.
 
✓ Prices in general fell 25 percent between 1929 and 1933, 
making many assets, such as houses, worth less than the 
money owed on them.

Recessions after the 
Great Depression
The Great Depression was the King Kong of the U.S. economy’s 
downturns. It easily dwarfed all the recessions before it (although 
the recessions in the 1870s and 1890s — see Chapter 3 — were 
pretty grim too), and we haven’t seen anything like it since. But 
that doesn’t mean the economy has been all milk and honey since 
the Great Depression ended.
In fact, according to the official arbiter of recessions — the business 
cycle dating committee of the National Bureau of Economic 
Research (see Chapter 2) — 11 recessions have occurred since 
World War II ended.
 
On average, the first ten recessions lasted 10
1⁄2 months. (I can’t 
report the duration of the 11th recession because it wasn’t over as 
of this writing.) On average, unemployment rates increased a 
maximum of 2.5 percent. And the gross domestic product, adjusted 
for inflation, dropped an average maximum of 1.9 percent.
Those are relatively mild averages. For example, the average 
length of 101/2 months is just half of the average 21 months that 
recessions lasted prior to the Great Depression.
Debating “the Great Moderation”
Some economists have called the post-war pattern of milder 
recessions “the Great Moderation.” But because economists like to 
argue about nearly everything, there is disagreement about what 
caused the more moderate recessionary periods.
One theory is that better information-gathering techniques allowed 
the Federal Reserve Board (see Chapter 2) to stay on top of the 
economic situation and ease up or tighten interest rates. Doing so 
has allowed the money supply to increase when recessions hit and 
decrease when inflation is a threat.
Another theory is that the expansion of service industries’ role in 
the U.S. economy made it less prone to the ups and downs of an 
economy based heavily on manufacturing. At the same time, the 
theory goes, manufacturers and retailers did a better job of main-
taining inventories at levels that neither flooded the market nor 
starved it.

 Chapter 14: Lessons Learned from the Great Depression 233
And some people believe that an expansion of credit following 
World War II enabled people to adopt buy-now, pay-later spending 
patterns instead of everyone stopping spending when times get 
rough. The monthly credit card payments helped keep things rolling.
Looking at post-war recessions
Whatever the reasons, the result is that nothing like the Great 
Depression has come along in the post-war United States — so far. 
Here’s a look at the 11 recessions that have occurred since 1945.
1948
Economists say this 11-month downturn, which began in November 
1948, was a “natural down cycle” caused by the economy adjusting 
to post-war production. The unemployment rate reached 7.9 percent; 
the gross domestic product (GDP) dropped by 1.8 percent.
1953
Beginning in July 1953, this ten-month recession has been attributed 
to the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) tightening money supplies 
in an effort to head off inflation following the end of the Korean 
War. The federal government diverting more money into national 
security intensified the problem. Unemployment climbed to 6.1 
percent, and the GDP dropped by 2.7 percent.
1957
This recession lasted only eight months, starting in August 
1957, and was attributed to the Fed tightening money supplies. 
Unemployment climbed to 7.1 percent, and the GDP dropped 
by 3.7 percent. Interestingly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
dropped 19 percent during this recession after holding steady in 
the more severe 1953 recession.
1960
A ten-month recession that began in April 1960 was triggered by a 
combination of high inflation and growing unemployment (which 
reached 7.1 percent). Increased government spending ended it. 
The GDP dropped 1.1 percent.
1969
This relatively mild 11-month recession that began in December 
1969 was again caused by increasing inflation and declining 
employment. Unemployment peaked at 6.1 percent; the GDP 
dropped by 0.2 percent.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
234
1973
This one was a nasty bugger, beginning in November 1973 and 
lasting 16 months. It was caused by a combination of factors. The 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quadrupled 
oil prices as a consequence of war in the Middle East. Inflation 
soared, partly as a result of federal spending (on the Vietnam War 
and social service programs) and partly because the United States 
went off the gold standard (see Chapter 7).
President Richard Nixon imposed wage-and-price controls, which 
kept prices so high that demand fell. The result was stagflation, a 
relatively rare economic condition that combines recession with 
inflation. Unemployment reached 9 percent; the GDP dropped 3.1 
percent.
1980
This recession was actually just a preview of a much nastier one 
that began in 1981. The 1980 version started in January 1980 and 
ended in June.
1981
This 16-month-long recession began in July 1981 and was widely 
considered to be the worst since the Great Depression. It’s usually 
attributed to two causes:
 
✓ A revolution in Iran that resulted in sharply higher oil prices.
 
✓ Interest rates that were raised to the highest level since the 
Civil War in an effort to fight inflation.
Unemployment soared to a post-Depression record high of 10.8 
percent, and it stayed above 10 percent for ten months. The GDP 
dropped 2.9 percent.
1990
This relatively mild eight-month recession that began in July 1990 
was most probably a result of a crisis in the savings and loan 
industry the year before.
2001
An eight-month recession that began in March 2001 was sparked 
by a severe downturn in Internet businesses (the “dot-com indus-
try”) and aggravated by the terrorist attacks of September 11. 
Unemployment hit 6 percent, but the GDP dropped hardly at all.

 Chapter 14: Lessons Learned from the Great Depression 235
2007
This recession began in December 2007 and, as of March 2009, was 
entering its 16th month. That duration made it at least as long as 
any recession since the Great Depression.
The causes of what was sometimes wryly referred to as “the Great 
Recession” were rooted in the bursting of a real estate bubble in 
the United States.
 
Simply (and simplistically) put, lenders made home loans to a 
large number of people who couldn’t afford them. The loans were 
“bundled” together and resold as securities. When the borrowers 
began defaulting on the loans, the securities lost value. Major 
lenders and other firms that dealt in the mortgage-based securities, 
from banks to the world’s largest insurance company, went belly 
up or were financially crippled.
The collapses and crippling, in turn, shocked the stock market. 
The market lost almost 50 percent of its value between December 
2007 and March 2009. Unemployment reached 8.1 percent, and the 
gross domestic product dropped 2.2 percent.
How Things Have Changed 
since 1929
Once upon a time, the U.S. stock market fell sharply. Financial 
institutions that had made unwise and highly speculative investments 
began to teeter; some collapsed. Home mortgages were foreclosed 
at an accelerating rate. Some people had dangerously overextended 
their credit and were facing debts they couldn’t pay.
Other people feared times would get worse, so they quit spending. 
That action caused manufacturers to produce less and lay off 
workers, which raised unemployment levels, which increased fears 
of an economic collapse, which led to even less spending.
 
The economic mess was precipitated by, in the words of a 
prominent economist at the time, “an abundance of greed and an 
absence of fear (that) led some to make investments not based 
on the real value of assets, but on the faith that there would be 
another who would pay more for those assets.”
“At the same time,” the economist continued, “the government 
turned a blind eye to these practices and the potential consequences 
for the economy as a whole.”

Part IV: Fixing Things  
236
“[E]ventually however,” he said, “greed gave way to fear . . . it is 
the transition from an excess of greed to an excess of fear that 
President (Franklin) Roosevelt had in mind when he famously 
observed that the only thing we have to fear was fear itself.”
The economist was Lawrence Summers, who was Secretary of the 
Treasury not under Roosevelt but under President Bill Clinton, 
and who was named director of the National Economic Council by 
President Barack Obama.
 
Summers wasn’t speaking in 1933 about the Great Depression. 
He was speaking in mid-March 2009 about a worldwide recession 
that began in late 2007 and was on to the verge of becoming the 
longest economic downturn in the United States since the Great 
Depression.
The numbers from the 2007 recession were indeed sobering:
 
✓ $50 trillion in wealth was erased worldwide between late 2007 
and spring 2009, $7 trillion of it from the U.S. stock market and 
$6 trillion from U.S. real estate.
 
✓ The gross domestic product decreased and the unemployment 
rate increased at the fastest rates in more than half a century; 
at least 4.4 million jobs were lost in the United States alone.
In addition, the net worth of many Americans suffered a double 
whammy, as securities in the form of stocks, mutual funds, and 
retirement programs such as 401(k) plans took a big hit at the 
same time that real estate valuations headed south in a hurry.
 
In a speech in early March 2009, Christina Romer, the White House 
chief economist, acknowledged she had found herself “uttering the 
words ‘worst since the Great Depression’ far too often: the worst 
twelve month job loss since the Great Depression; the worst 
financial crisis since the Great Depression; the worst rise in home 
foreclosures since the Great Depression.”
But, Romer noted, for as many similarities as there were between 
the Great Depression and the recession that began in late 2007, 
there were probably more key differences.
That’s “trillion,” with a “T”
According to the online news archive Nexis, the term “trillion dollars,” or close vari-
ations of it, appeared in U.S. newspaper stories 410 times in all of 1989. It appeared 
1,918 times in the month of February 2009.

 Chapter 14: Lessons Learned from the Great Depression 237
 
That analysis is borne out by comparing some of the numbers 
from the two periods:
 
✓ The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 89 percent between 
September 1929 and July 1932. The drop between December 
2007 and March 2009 was 49 percent.
 
✓ The economy contracted 25 percent between 1929 and 1932. 
Between 2007 and 2009, it contracted about 6 percent.
 
✓ The unemployment rate during the Great Depression peaked 
at 24.9 percent in 1933. In March 2009, it was at 8.1 percent. 
Moreover, there were far more two-income families in 2009 
than in 1933, which helped ease the sting if one of the wage 
earners lost his or her job.
 
✓ While an estimated 50 percent of all home mortgages were in 
arrears in 1933, the figure was 12 percent in early 2009.
“If what we have now is a rainstorm,” economist and writer Amity 
Shlaes said in a January 2009 appearance on National Public Radio, 
the Great Depression “was a (Hurricane) Katrina.”
The Legacy of the Great Depression
The impacts of the Great Depression on 21st-century America are 
measurable in several ways. One way is that, for good or ill, the 
Great Depression significantly enhanced the role the federal 
government plays in the U.S. economy. When economic trouble 
hits, most Americans look quickly to Washington to see what the 
government is going to do about it.
Much of that expectation is based on the legacy of federal govern-
ment programs that were first created in response to the Great 
Depression itself and exist today as safeguards against some of the 
worst blows of a recession.
 
Those programs include federal insurance against the loss of bank 
deposits; insurance against unemployment; a federal pension 
system for the elderly and disabled; and programs that provide 
food, shelter, and financial aid to the needy.
Those Great Depression legacy programs have been joined in the 
decades since by other “safety net” components such as federal 
health insurance for senior citizens and the poor, and safeguards 
such as checks on abuses of the stock market and increased 
vigilance over the money supply.

Part IV: Fixing Things  
238
The public’s expectation of government intervention has also 
engendered a feeling of obligation in most post-Depression 
governments to act quickly — if not always wisely — in the face 
of economic problems. For example, after taking office in January 
2009, President Barack Obama quickly launched a three-pronged 
attack on the deepening recession that had begun in 2007:
 
✓ Less than a month after taking office, Obama signed the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the 
largest economic stimulus effort in U.S. history. The $800 
billion act included funds for everything from income tax 
breaks to extended unemployment benefits to money for state 
programs to financial incentives for buying new cars and first 
homes.
 
✓ The second prong was called the Financial Stability Plan, 
which included elements that ranged from the government 
buying up or refinancing mortgage, student, and small busi-
ness loans as a way of getting non-bank lenders back on their 
feet, to injecting federal funds into stressed banks.
 
✓ The third prong was the Helping Families Save Their Homes 
Act, which was designed to make it easier to modify home 
mortgages and reduce the rising numbers of foreclosures that 
were mainly a result of the real estate bubble bursting in 2007.
“The president is committed to an approach that moves aggressively 
on jobs, on credit, on housing,” said Summers, Obama’s chief 
economic advisor, in a March speech to the Brookings Institute. 
“In this effort, he has insisted that we be guided by the recognition 
that the risks of overreaction are dwarfed by the risks of inaction.”
The final lesson to be learned from the Great Depression is that all 
bad things, like all good things, come to an end. While historians 
and economists argue as to what, if anything, worked to help end 
the Great Depression, the inescapable fact is that it did end.
 
“If we continue to heed the lessons of the Great Depression,” noted 
economics historian and presidential adviser Christina Romer in 
March 2009, “there is every reason to believe that we will weather 
this trial and come through to the other side even stronger than 
before.”

N
o book For Dummies is complete without The Part of 
Tens. This part features lists of ten good movies 
either made or set in the Great Depression, ten things that 
were invented or popularized in the period, and ten things 
that weren’t all that depressing about the Great 
Depression.
(Someday there oughta be a book For Dummies with 
nothing but Parts of Tens. . . .)

Chapter 15
Ten Good Movies Made in or 
about the Great Depression
T
housands of movies were made during and about the Great 
Depression, so it’s tough to pare the list down to just ten good 
ones. My chief criterion was that they tell viewers something about 
what the period was like.
The Public Enemy (1931)
Stars: James Cagney, Jean Harlow. Director: William Wellman. 
Cagney plays Tom Powers, a working-class kid who “wises up” 
and becomes a bootlegger and hoodlum, only to get gunned down 
at the end of the film.
Although Cagney’s character is supposed to be a bad guy — in 
one famous scene he mashes half a grapefruit in the face of his 
girlfriend — Cagney was so charismatic that many people in the 
audience felt bad when Tom Powers was killed. The film, a hit at 
the box office, was made before Hollywood established its self-
censorship board in late 1934. It was one of the reasons the censor-
ship code, which effectively banned gangster movies, was adopted. 
(See Chapter 9 for more on gangster films during the 1930s.)
I Am a Fugitive from a 
Chain Gang (1932)
Stars: Paul Muni, Glenda Farrell. Director: Mervyn LeRoy. Based 
on a real-life story, the film follows a guy (Muni) who is wrongfully 
charged with a crime and sentenced to hard labor on a Georgia 
chain gang. He makes a daring escape and lives a successful life 
under an assumed name for seven years. He is eventually tricked 
into surrendering with the promise of lenient treatment, only to 
find himself back on the chain gang. He escapes again, and as the 
movie ends, he is still on the lam.

Part V: The Part of Tens  
242
This film was controversial when it was released because of its 
depiction of the way prison inmates were treated. It also disturbed 
audiences because its ending was neither happy nor conclusive. 
In the final scene, when his lover asks how he lives as a fugitive, 
Muni’s character says, “I steal,” as he slips into the darkness. Great 
Depression audiences undoubtedly felt great empathy with the 
injustice of Muni’s character’s situation.
Gabriel Over the White 
House (1933)
Stars: Walter Huston, Karen Morely. Director: Gregory La Cava. 
This is one weird movie. Huston plays Judson Hammond, a new 
U.S. president who is a good-time guy and stooge for political party 
bosses. Then he has a car accident, gets a visit from the archangel 
Gabriel, comes out of a coma, and assumes power as dictator. He 
takes over Congress, finds public works jobs for the unemployed, 
rounds up gangsters and has them shot, and bullies other countries 
into paying their debts to the United States and signing an 
international peace treaty. He dies a hero to the world.
The film was based on a novel by an ex-British general and brought 
to the screen by newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst. It was 
produced with the approval of Roosevelt, whom Hearst backed 
in the 1932 election. Hearst apparently meant it as something of a 
guide for FDR to follow. Roosevelt called it “an intensely interesting 
picture.” It was a big box office hit in 1933 but faded into obscurity, 
as did Hearst’s support for FDR by the end of 1933.
Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)
Stars: Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler. Director: Mervyn LeRoy. A 1933 
critic called it “an imaginatively staged, breezy show, with a story 
of no (great) consequence.” That was fine with Depression-era 
audiences. Musicals offered an escape for people who came to see 
the lavish song-and-dance numbers — not to gain insight into the 
human condition.
Based on a hit Broadway play, Gold Diggers actually had two 
directors: LeRoy for what little plot there was (struggling actresses 
and songwriter get big breaks on Broadway), and showman Busby 
Berkeley for the musical numbers. There is one politically charged 
song, “Remember My Forgotten Man,” that’s about the World War I 
vets who had hit hard times. (Read more about them in Chapter 4.)

 Chapter 15: Ten Good Movies Made in or about the Great Depression 243
Dead End (1937)
Stars: Joel McCrea, Humphrey Bogart, Sylvia Sidney. Director: 
William Wyler. This film is set at New York City’s East River, where 
residents of luxury apartments view the river while trying to ignore 
the slums along its banks. A gang of poor kids bully and then 
accept a rich kid; gangster Bogart tries to kidnap the kid; out-of-
work architect McCrea kills Bogart; and one of the poor kids does 
the right thing and turns himself in for stabbing the rich kid’s dad.
The film was spawned from a hit Broadway play. It’s notable both 
for its depiction of inner-city life during the Great Depression (The 
New York Times’ review called it “disturbingly accurate”) and the 
debut of the Dead End Kids, a group of young male actors who 
would go on to star in nearly 90 low-budget films through 1958.
The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
Stars: Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell. Director: John Ford. Based on 
John Steinbeck’s novel (see Chapter 8 for more on the book), the 
film is the story of the Joads, an Oklahoma family that has been 
forced off its farm and migrates to California. At the end of the film, 
the eldest son (Henry Fonda) kills a man and leaves the family, 
presumably to fight social injustice.
The film tones down the novel, as well as injecting extra optimism. 
“They can’t wipe us out and they can’t lick us,” says Darwell as the 
matriarch of the family. “We’ll go on forever Pa, ’cause we’re the 
people.” Despite its somewhat exaggerated portrayal of the “Okie” 
migration, the movie is often listed as among the best of all time.
They Shoot Horses, Don’t 
They? (1969)
Stars: Jane Fonda, Michael Sarrazin, Gig Young. Director: Sydney 
Pollack. Based on a 1935 novel, this film tells the story of people in a 
dance marathon, which people participated in (along with other types 
of endurance contests) because they were desperate for money in the 
1930s. (See Chapter 4 for more on endurance contests.) As the mara-
thon drags on, an unscrupulous emcee comes up with gimmicks that 
entertain the audience while adding to the dancers’ misery.
Although the film takes place almost entirely within a ballroom, it 
does give audiences a glimpse into how the desperate circumstances 
of the Great Depression led to desperate efforts by some people.

Part V: The Part of Tens  
244
Sounder (1972)
Stars: Cicely Tyson, Paul Winfield, Kevin Hooks. Director: Martin 
Ritt. Based on a young adults’ book, the film concerns an African 
American family of sharecroppers in Louisiana during the Great 
Depression. The father (Winfield) is arrested after stealing food for 
his hungry family and is taken off to a labor camp. The son (Hooks) 
goes off in search of his dad and winds up at the home of a 
schoolteacher (Tyson), who encourages the boy’s desire for an 
education. Sounder? He’s the family dog.
While a bit schmaltzy, the movie affords a view of how tough 
things were for rural African Americans in the 1930s. For more on 
that topic, see Chapter 5.
Bound for Glory (1976)
Stars: David Carradine, Ronny Cox. Director: Hal Ashby. This film 
is based on the life of folk singer/political activist Woody Guthrie. 
Guthrie lived the life of the people he sang about: the hardest-hit 
victims of the Dust Bowl and the hard times. (See Chapter 6 for 
more on the Dust Bowl.)
The film is based on a 1943 autobiography and follows Guthrie 
(Carradine) on his trek to and around California in the late 1930s. 
Unlike The Grapes of Wrath, the film shows what life was like for 
“Okies” in both rural and urban settings.
Cinderella Man (2005)
Stars: Russell Crowe, Renée Zellweger, Paul Giamati. Director: 
Ron Howard. This biographical film traces the life of James J. 
Braddock, a promising boxer in the late 1920s who gets hurt and 
is forced to take menial jobs just as the Great Depression is begin-
ning. Desperate to feed his family of five and forced to go on relief, 
Braddock (Crowe) goes back to boxing and beats long odds to 
become the heavyweight champion.
The movie accurately depicts Braddock as the hero of millions 
of other Americans down on their luck in the 1930s, and it shows 
how close to disaster so many people’s lives were in the Great 
Depression.

Chapter 16
Ten Things Invented or 
Popularized in the Great 
Depression
N
ecessity is the mother of invention (and laziness the father), 
and there was certainly a lot of necessity during the Great 
Depression. So maybe it’s not surprising that a lot of stuff was 
invented, improved, or popularized during the period. Here’s a 
look at just ten such things.
Sliced Bread (1930)
Ever hear the saying “It’s the greatest thing since sliced bread” 
and wonder how long that actually means? In 1930, the Continental 
Baking Co. began marketing pre-sliced Wonder Bread around the 
country. A reliable slicing machine had been perfected in 1928, 
making the mass production of pre-sliced bread possible.
Sales lagged at first because consumers were suspicious of any-
thing so convenient. But by 1933, 80 percent of bread sold in the 
United States was pre-sliced and wrapped. For a brief time during 
World War II, the federal government banned the sale of pre-sliced 
bread because the Feds thought it would save on waxed paper 
used to wrap the sliced loaves. But the ban was rescinded when 
the government realized it really wasn’t saving money and was just 
irritating the bejabbers out of a lot of sandwich makers.
Twinkies (1930)
As long as we’re in the bakery aisle: One day in the spring of 1930, 
James A. Dewar, an official for the relatively new Continental 
Baking Co., realized that equipment the firm owned for making 

Part V: The Part of Tens  
246
strawberry-filled “Little Short Cake Fingers” was being used only 
when strawberries were in season. So Dewar tried filling the cakes 
with a banana-flavored crème, and it worked.
Inspired by a billboard advertising Twinkle Toe Shoes, Dewar 
named his confectionary creation “Twinkies.” They sold in a 
package of two for 5 cents (64 cents in 2008 money). Because of 
a banana shortage during World War II, the company switched to 
a vanilla-based filling. In 2007, the corporation that now owns the 
brand was cranking out 500 million Twinkies a year.
Scotch Tape (1930)
One of the handiest household items was invented by a banjo 
player who had a job with a sandpaper company. The musician/
inventor was named Richard Drew. He worked for the Minnesota 
Mining and Manufacturing Co., which had started out as a mining 
business but switched to making sandpaper products.
In 1925, Drew invented masking tape so auto painters could more 
easily use two colors without the border between them getting 
messy. In 1930, he came up with a variation on the tape, using 
transparent cellulose. The new tape became a big hit in the Great 
Depression because it allowed people to mend things rather than 
replace them.
The name? The first version of the masking tape was light on 
adhesive and fell off. A frustrated auto painter told Drew to tell 
his “Scotch” (a pejorative for cheap or stingy) bosses to put more 
stick’em on their product. Drew’s employer, better known as the 
3M Co., not only did so, but it also trademarked the name.
Alka-Seltzer (1931)
So, in 1928 this guy walks into The Elkhart Truth, an Indiana 
newspaper, and notices no one is sick from the flu that’s going 
around. The editor tells the guy it’s because of a mixture of aspirin, 
bicarbonate of soda, and lemon juice that he whips together for 
the staff.
Fast forward to 1931. The guy, whose name is Andrew H. Beardsley, 
is chairman of the Dr. Miles Medical Company. He has his chief 
chemist come up with an effervescent tablet with ingredients similar 
to the newspaper elixir. They call it Alka-Seltzer, and by 2005 they 
were selling 300 million tablets a year. Which is a lot of burping.

 Chapter 16: Ten Things Invented or Popularized 247
Fritos (1932)
Nineteen thirty-two didn’t seem like a really good year to start a 
business, especially in the snack food field. Undaunted, a Texan 
named Elmer Doolin borrowed $100 from his mom and bought 
a recipe, 19 retail accounts, and an old handheld device called a 
“potato ricer.” With it he churned out ten pounds a day of salted 
corn chips that he sold for a nickel a bag.
Eventually, Doolin expanded his production facility from the 
kitchen to the garage and got some better machinery. By the 
21st century, the company he started was the largest salty snack 
company in the world. The Frito Pie? Some say Doolin’s mom 
invented the combination of chili, cheese, and Fritos. Others say 
a Woolworth’s in Santa Fe, New Mexico, invented it. Fortunately, 
Alka-Seltzer had been invented by then.
Toll House Cookies (1933)
Ever started baking something and found out you lacked a key 
ingredient? Thankfully for cookie lovers everywhere, that’s what 
happened to Ruth Graves Wakefield. The owner of a lodge in 
Massachusetts called the Toll House Inn, Wakefield was making 
cookies one day when she found she had run out of baker’s 
chocolate. So she took a semisweet chocolate bar a fellow named 
Andrew Nestle had given her and cut it into tiny chips.
When the cookies were done, she found the chips hadn’t melted. 
Everyone loved the cookies anyway. In 1939, Nestle began making 
semisweet chocolate morsels. Milk has never been the same.
The Laundromat (1934)
Fritos weren’t the only thing to come out of Texas in the Great 
Depression. In 1934, a fellow named J.F. Cantrell looked around his 
Forth Worth neighborhood and noticed that many of his neighbors 
lacked a washing machine. So he went out and bought four electric 
washing machines, installed them in a building, and charged 
people by the hour to use them.
Thus was born the “washateria,” later to be known as the laundromat. 
Cantrell’s customers were provided with hot water, but they had 
to bring their own soap. Variations on laundromats over the years 
have included restaurants, bowling alleys, and even a topless 
nightclub. I don’t know whether you had to bring your own soap to 
that one.

Part V: The Part of Tens  
248
Tampax (1936)
In 1931, a Colorado doctor named Earle Haas invented a new kind 
of tampon that used a telescoping cardboard tube applicator. He 
called it “Tampax,” which he said was a combination of “tampon” 
and “vaginal pack.” Unable to sell his invention, he sold the patent 
and trademark to a business group that began marketing it in 1936.
Naturally, one of the big hurdles was to promote a product no one 
wanted to talk about. So the company tried to closely tie its product 
to the medical community. Its first ad proclaimed it was “accepted 
for advertising by the American Medical Association.” That last part 
didn’t mean it was endorsed by the AMA, just that it was accepted 
as an ad in the AMA journal. Never mind, it worked. Tampax 
eventually cornered 55 percent of the worldwide tampon market.
Nylon Bristle Toothbrush (1938)
In 1930, DuPont Chemical Company scientists came up with a sub-
stance that stretched and had a silky texture. And that’s why you 
probably don’t brush your teeth with hair from a Siberian boar.
Toothbrush bristles were usually made from boar’s hair up until 
1938. But in that year, Dr. West’s Miracle Tuft Toothbrushes came 
along, with bristles made of something called nylon. They were 
hard on gums at first, but scientists eventually found a way to 
soften the bristles. And the folks at DuPont were so excited with 
their new substance that they came out with another nylon prod-
uct the very next year: women’s stockings. It caught on.
Rudolph the Red-Nosed 
Reindeer (1939)
In 1939, executives at the Montgomery Ward department stores 
asked Robert L. May, a company advertising copywriter, to come 
up with an original story they could give away at Christmas. May 
came up with a story about a red-nosed reindeer. The reindeer’s 
original name was Rollo, then Reginald. Finally, with the help of his 
4-year-old daughter, May settled on Rudolph.
The story was an immediate hit, and the company distributed 
2.4 million copies in the first year. The story and character were 
turned into lots of products. And in 1949, a cowboy star named 
Gene Autry recorded a song written by May’s brother-in-law, 
Johnny Marks, about Rudolph. You may have heard it.

Chapter 17
Ten Not-So-Depressing 
Things about the Great 
Depression
T
he overall impression many people have about the Great 
Depression is that everyone was pretty depressed all the time. 
But as I explain in Chapter 10, Americans didn’t walk around with 
their chins dragging for an entire decade. Here’s a list of ten things 
about the Great Depression that were pretty cool, then and now.
Marx Brothers Movies
The Marx Brothers may have been the perfect comedic tonic for 
the Great Depression. On-screen (and sometimes off it), the Marxes 
(Marxists?) did what they wanted, went where they wanted, and said 
what they wanted (except for Harpo, who never spoke on-screen).
For people who had been beaten down by forces they didn’t 
understand and couldn’t control, the brothers’ (yes, they were 
really brothers) fresh and funny anarchy was a great way to 
strike back at “the system,” even if only vicariously. “Practically 
everyone wants a good laugh right now,” observed Variety of the 
brothers’ 1933 anti-war, anti-government film Duck Soup, “and this 
should make practically everybody laugh.”
The Marx Brothers starred in 11 films during the Great Depression, 
including two that were versions of their Broadway plays The 
Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers. Among the others were such gems 
as Horse Feathers, A Night at the Opera, and A Day at the Races.
Shirley Temple
At less than four feet tall, Shirley Temple was the biggest thing in 
Hollywood for much of the Great Depression. Little Shirley wasn’t 

Part V: The Part of Tens  
250
vertically challenged. She was just a child, born the year before the 
1929 stock market crash.
But what a child. For four straight years, from 1935 to 1938, the 
curly-haired moppet was the biggest box office draw in the country. 
Her relentlessly cheery disposition and big smile were the perfect 
antidotes for the Great Depression blues, and she was a walking, 
talking, dancing, singing goldmine too. Besides making $5 million 
a year for her studio (Twentieth Century Fox) and $300,000 a year 
for herself, Temple spawned merchandise that included dolls, 
soap, baby carriages, and ribbons — and a hair style that was 
mimicked by hundreds of thousands of little girls.
When she grew up and eventually left show business, she didn’t 
do badly either. Temple became a U.S representative to the United 
Nations and the U.S. ambassador to Ghana.
The Golden Gate Bridge
On May 28, 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressed a telegraph 
key at the White House announcing to the world that something of 
a miracle had occurred in San Francisco: A public works project 
had been completed under budget and ahead of schedule.
Okay, so the real news was that the Golden Gate Bridge had opened, 
connecting San Francisco and the eastern side of San Francisco Bay 
by stretching across 4,200 feet of open water. That made the structure 
the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time. Construction 
took a bit more than four years and cost $35 million (about $5.4 billion 
in 2008 dollars), paid for through a bond issuance by six northern 
California counties. It also cost the lives of 11 workers.
The bridge actually opened to foot traffic the day before FDR 
hit the telegraph key, and 178,000 people poured across the Art 
Deco structure in both directions. Time magazine called the 
bridge “the world’s greatest by practically every measurement — 
length of span, height, difficulty of achievement.” Not a bad Great 
Depression legacy.
The Wizard of Oz Movie
This film is one of the Great Depression’s legacies that was more 
appreciated in later years than it was at the time. Released in 1939, 
the film got good, but not great, reviews. The New York Times 
suggested that it was “all so well-intentioned, so genial and so 
gay that any reviewer who would look down his nose at the fun-
making should be spanked and sent off, supperless, to bed.” Time 

 Chapter 17: Ten Not-So-Depressing Things about the Great Depression 251
magazine noted that the pure fantasy parts were great, but “when it 
descends to earth, it collapses like a scarecrow in a cloudburst.”
The film, which was based on a beloved 1900 children’s novel by L. 
Frank Baum, cost Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) a bit less than $2.8 
million to make ($42.7 million in 2008 dollars) and took in a bit more 
than $3 million when it was originally released. But it did quite well 
when it was re-released in 1949, taking in another $1.5 million.
And after it began running on television in 1956, the film’s popularity 
soared, as did its standing in film history. In 2008, the American 
Film Institute named The Wizard of Oz the best fantasy film of all 
time and the film’s song “Over the Rainbow” as the best movie 
song of all time. I guess they just didn’t appreciate winged monkeys 
during the Great Depression.
“Wrong Way” Corrigan
Douglas G. Corrigan had some solid aviation credentials when he 
climbed into the cockpit of his airplane on the morning of July 17, 
1938. He had been flying for 13 years, had helped build the plane in 
which Charles Lindbergh became the first man to fly solo across the 
Atlantic Ocean, and had himself flown across the United States solo.
On this particular morning, Corrigan had filed a plan to fly from New 
York to California. Less than 30 hours later, he landed in Ireland. 
Corrigan explained to bemused customs officials that it had been 
foggy when he left New York and he had misread his compass and 
had flown east instead of west. Everyone had a good laugh over 
the mistake. Corrigan and his plane were put on an ocean liner and 
sailed back to New York, where he received a good-humored ticker-
tape parade attended by an estimated 1 million people.
“Wrong Way Corrigan” became a nationwide phrase synonymous 
with going in the wrong direction. But there’s a big question 
whether the pilot really did go in a direction he didn’t intend. Turns 
out Corrigan had been denied permission to make the dangerous 
trans-Atlantic flight for three years before he made his trip. Many 
people suspect that he was dodging aviation bureaucrats with his 
“wrong way” story. If so, Corrigan, who died in 1995, never confessed.
The Debut of Bugs Bunny
The first screen appearance of the cartoon character the 
Encyclopedia Britannica called “the most celebrated and endur-
ing lagomorph in worldwide popular culture” came in 1938. 
Lagomorph? It’s the mammalian order to which rabbits and hares 

Part V: The Part of Tens  
252
belong. Anyway, the wisecracking, carrot-chomping rabbit showed 
up in a cartoon starring Porky Pig called “Porky’s Hare Hunt.” He 
was, however, a mere shadow of the rabbit that movie audiences 
would come to know and love.
In 1940, the bunny first uttered “Eh, what’s up doc?” and in 1941 
was formally christened with the name “Bugs.” The appellation 
came from the nickname of animator Ben “Bugs” Hardaway, who 
had drawn a casual sketch of the character that was labeled “Bugs’ 
Bunny” by a colleague.
The rabbit quickly became a favorite of late Great Depression and 
World War II audiences. Bugs sometimes emulated the on-screen 
persona of another period favorite, Groucho Marx, using a carrot 
the way Groucho used a cigar, making jokes directly to the audience, 
and even using a Groucho line: “Of course you know, this means 
war!” It must’ve worked: In 2002, TV Guide named Bugs the number-
one cartoon character of all time.
Baseball’s All-Star Game
Baseball fans around the country picked up newspapers on July 7, 
1933, and read about a new version of the national pastime, played 
the day before in Chicago: “Out of the shooting stars of baseball’s 
dream game blazed the mighty war club of the one and only Babe 
Ruth,” the Associated Press reported, “to hoist the American 
League to a spectacular 4–2 triumph over the National League in 
the first all-star game in the majors’ history.”
The game, which had been played at Comiskey Park before a 
crowd of 49,000, was the brainchild of Chicago Tribune sports 
editor Arch Ward. Ward had a two-fold purpose: to have a big 
sporting event to go along with the city’s “Century of Progress” 
World Exposition, and to raise money for a pension program for 
veteran ballplayers.
The game couldn’t have gone better if Ward had scripted it. The 
teams were selected by fans, who voted on ballots provided at the 
nation’s ballparks and in newspapers. Ruth, the greatest player 
the game ever produced, and who was near the end of his career, 
hit a two-run homer and made a game-saving catch against the 
right-field wall in the eighth inning. Initially planned as a one-time 
event, the All-Star Game has been played every year since and has 
become a midsummer staple.

The Introduction of Muzak
If you’ve ever been on a long elevator ride and wondered whom to 
blame for the music being played, it was George Owen Squier. Who? 
Squier. He was a World War I two-star general who had the distinc-
tion of being the world’s first airplane passenger when he flew for 
nine minutes on a Wright Brothers plane in 1908. He also invented a 
device that could be used to measure the speed of a projectile.
But Squier’s lasting claim to immortality — or ignominy — was 
something he came up with in 1922. It was a way to transmit 
phonograph music over electric power lines. That same year, 
he sold his invention to a firm called North American Company. 
Twelve years passed before the firm began to market the invention, 
which Squier had dubbed “Muzak,” a cross between “Kodak” 
(cameras were all the rage then) and “music.”
Unfortunately for the company, in the dozen years it had taken 
to get Muzak to the market, commercial radio had caught on, and 
there wasn’t much call for Muzak in private homes. Plus, it was 
the middle of the Great Depression. Undeterred, the firm turned 
its attention to public places, such as restaurants, office buildings, 
and yes, elevators.
The product was helped along by several more-or-less scientific 
studies in the 1930s that concluded low-volume, unobtrusive music 
increased worker productivity, decreased absenteeism, and even 
made cows give more milk and chickens more eggs. As of 2009, 
Muzak was piping 2.6 million different songs into tens of thousands 
of stores, offices, and elevators around the world, with a daily listen-
ing audience estimated at 100 million. So feel free to sing the praises 
of the Great Depression’s George Owen Squier. Or curse his name.
The World’s — and Other — Fairs
As I note in Chapter 10, Depression-era Americans were crazy 
about motor trips, and among the period’s chief destinations were 
various fairs and expositions around the country. And not just any 
old fairs and expositions.
In 1933, Chicago celebrated its 100th birthday by putting on a 
“Century of Progress” World Exposition. The fair, on the banks 
of Lake Michigan, showed off ultra-modern architectural styles, 
as well as old-fashioned fair attractions such as hoochie-coochie 
dancers like Sally Rand and “Little Egypt.” It also featured the 
wonders of electricity with what was billed as “the world’s largest 
display of electric lighting.” The expo drew 10 million people.

Part V: The Part of Tens  
254
In 1935, San Diego hosted the California Pacific Exposition, 
exposing tens of thousands to the wonders of Southern California. 
The following year, both Texas and Michigan staged lavish fairs, 
followed by the Golden Gate Exposition in San Francisco. But the 
coup-de-decade was the 1939–40 New York World’s Fair.
Developed on 1,216 acres that had previously hosted an ash dump, 
the fair featured everything from a 250-foot parachute jump to 
the broadcast of a speech by President Roosevelt over a medium 
called television. (About 1,000 New Yorkers saw it.) There were 
pavilions hosted by various nations, including one that promoted 
the establishment — some day — of a Jewish state in the Middle 
East. There was a gigantic diorama of future life in the United 
States, complete with 500,000 individually designed homes, a 
million miniature trees, and 50,000 miniature vehicles. (They 
somehow forgot to include any churches and, after a lot of 
complaints, were forced to add a few hundred.)
While the fair drew more than 45 million visitors during its two-
year run, it actually lost quite a bit of money. That’s what happens 
when you sandwich a world’s fair between a Great Depression and 
a world war.
Superman
Yes, Superman! Strange visitor from another planet, with commercial, 
promotional, and mass-merchandising powers far beyond those of 
mortal comic book heroes!
Or something like that. In truth, Superman was from Cleveland, or 
at least his creators were. It was 1933, and two 19-year-old guys 
named Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were looking for a career path. 
They came up with a cape-wearing superhero and for the next five 
years shopped their idea around. Finally, in June 1938, the Man of 
Steel made his debut in Action Comics No. 1 (a mint copy of which 
was appraised at $340,000 in 2006).
The following year, Superman got his own comic book, and the 
year after that, his own radio show. The radio show, in fact, was 
where his fans first met Daily Planet editor Perry White, cub 
reporter Jimmy Olsen, and Police Inspector Bill Henderson, all of 
whom became regular members of the Superman family. It was 
also on radio that Superman first encountered Kryptonite, the 
debris of his home planet that is deadly to him.
Lois Lane? He met her in Action Comics No. 1. Even asked her on a 
date. Well, he was faster than a speeding bullet.

Appendix
For Further Reading
I
f you’ve been with me since the opening pages of this book, you 
may recall I point out in the Introduction that more books have 
been written about the Great Depression than any other period in 
U.S. history, except for maybe the Civil War.
Well, here’s a list of some of them. They range from new to older, 
and from general histories to tomes that laser in on a particular 
facet of the time.
 
✓ Best, Gary Dean. The Nickel and Dime Decade: American 
Popular Culture during the 1930s. Praeger Publishers, 
1993: From fads and crazes to shirt styles, a somewhat 
scholarly look at some breezy, yet interesting, aspects of the 
Great Depression.
 
✓ Congdon, Don (editor). The Thirties: A Time To Remember. 
Simon and Schuster, 1962: An engaging and entertaining 
collection of essays and articles about the Great Depression, 
both contemporary and historical.
 
✓ Egan, Timothy. The Worst Hard Time. Houghton Mifflin 
Harcourt, 2006: A tale from Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist 
Egan of those who were caught up in the Dust Bowl — and 
persevered. Reads like a novel.
 
✓ Gerdes, Louise I. (editor). The 1930s. Greenhaven Press, 
2000: A nifty collection of contemporary and modern essays 
and excerpts about issues and cultural events during the era.
 
✓ Green, Harvey. The Uncertainty of Everyday Life, 1915–
1945. University of Arkansas Press, 2000: Provides a look at 
how Americans made their way through life, including what 
they ate, what they did for fun, and how they got old.
 
✓ Kennedy, David M. Freedom from Fear: The American 
People in Depression and War, 1929–1945. Oxford 
University Press, 2001: The gold standard for history books 
on this period. Eminently readable, sweeping in scope, and 
highly detailed.

256
 
✓ Kyvig, David E. Daily Life in the United States, 1920–1940. 
Ivan R. Dee, 2004: A nifty balance of the vital and the trivial. 
Examines life in the 1920s and 1930s and includes a more 
detailed look at daily life in six U.S. cities, large and small.
 
✓ Lash, Joseph. Dealers and Dreamers: A New Look at the 
New Deal. Doubleday, 1988: Not so much a recitation of the 
New Deal’s programs as a story of the men and women who 
helped President Franklin D. Roosevelt put his visions to 
work.
 
✓ McElvaine, Robert S. Down and Out in the Great 
Depression: Letters from the “Forgotten Man.” University 
of North Carolina Press, 2007: Just what the title says — a 
collection of letters written to the White House during the 
1930s.
 
✓ McElvaine, Robert S. The Great Depression: America, 
1929–1941. Three Rivers Press, 1993: McElvaine takes an 
unflinching look at the period and critiques some other 
historical interpretations of it. Authoritative, if a bit cranky.
 
✓ Rothermund, Dietmar. The Global Impact of the Great 
Depression, 1929–1939. Taylor & Francis, 2007: A thorough, 
if a trifle tedious, look at how the rest of the world fared 
during the period.
 
✓ Shlaes, Amity. The Forgotten Man: A New History of the 
Great Depression. Harper Perennial, 2008: Shlaes, a 
conservative economist and columnist, explores the era by 
recounting the roles played by a diverse cast of characters 
that range from Herbert Hoover’s treasury secretary to the 
kosher butchers from Brooklyn whose court case ultimately 
ended one of the biggest New Deal programs.
 
✓ Watkins, T.H. The Hungry Years: A Narrative History of 
the Great Depression in America. Henry Holt and Co., 
1999: An excellent and thoroughly readable overview of the 
period that focuses less on what went on in Congress and 
more on what went on in the homeless camps.
