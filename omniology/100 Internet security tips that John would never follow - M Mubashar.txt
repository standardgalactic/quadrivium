easy access to them all in one place. It seems, however, that the articles I dig into are
always from the same sites. I’d like to share a handful of those sites with you today. Most
you will probably be familiar with, though some may be unknown. I’d highly recommend
adding them all to your RSS reader if you have one.
The sites are presented in alphabetical order. I’ve chosen 15 in total.
Darknet – The Darkside
Darknet was launched in 2006 but its origins lie in a network of friends that first formed
on EFNet IRC in 1999. With the tagline “Don’t learn to HACK, hack to LEARN”, the site

features excellent tool reviews, analysis of new vulnerabilities and comment on topics in
the press.

luxury of combing wirefeeds, multiple bug feeds, or vendor Websites to find out what’s

Li0n worm. The handlers had isolated the worm and begun analysis within 3 hours of the
