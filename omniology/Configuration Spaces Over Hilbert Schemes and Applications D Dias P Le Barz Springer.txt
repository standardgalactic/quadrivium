Introduction 
0.1 
Let f : V 
> W be a morphism of non-singular varieties over C, with dimV < dimW. 
Let d = cod(f) = dimW - dimV. The locus 88 of elements x E V such that there 
exists at least (k - 1) other points of V in the fiber f-if(x) is called k-uple locus of 
f. When it exists, a class m~: in the Chow ring CH'(V) of V, which represents V~:, is 
called k-uple class of f. Then a k-uple formula is a polynomial expression which gives 
m~: in terms of the Chern classes c, of the virtual normal bundle u(f) = f*TW - TV. 
0.2 
When one deals with the double formula, one is interested in the set of elements 
x E V such that the fiber f-if(x) contains at least one other point in addition to x. 
A typical example is the imbedding with normal crossings f : C ~ 
~2 of a smooth 
curve, where one wishes to count the number of double points of f(C). 
The case k = 2 was treated thoroughly by Laksov ([La]). The double formula was 
also found by Ronga ([Ro]) in the C ~ case. The demonstration consists in looking 
at the blowing-up V x V of V x V along the diagonal and applying the residual 
intersection formula ([FU2], thm 9.2, pp 161-162) in order to remove the exceptional 
divisor which corresponds to the solutions xl = x2 of f(xl) = f(x2) (which we do not 
want) at the lifted double locus (see [FU2], pp 165-166). Then the double class m2 is 
given in the Chow ring of V by the double formula : 
~ 
: 
f*L[v] - cd, 
where Ca is the d th Chern class of u(f), defined above. 
0.3 
When one deals with the triple formula, one is interested in the set of elements x C V 
such that f-if(x) contains at least two points in addition to x. A typical example 

2 
Introduction 
is the imbedding with normal crossings f : S 
~ ~2 of a non-singular surface, where 
one wishes to count the number of triple points of f(S). 
One difficulty is to define a class m 3 E CH'(V) representing the set V3 and to 
compute this class so that one has the trzple formula : 
d 
m3 = f* f.m2 - 2cdm2 + ~ 2JCd_jCd+j , 
j=l 
where c~ is the ith Chern class of ,(f). 
This was done by Kleiman [KL1, KL2], modulo some general hypotheses on the mor- 
phism f. Kleiman even established a stronger formula [KL3]. So did Ronga [Ro] in 
the C ~ case. (These are "refined" formulas in the sense that if f(xl) = f(x2) = f(x3), 
they count the set of non ordered {xl, x2, x3} having the same image by f and not the 
set of ordered (Xl, x2, x3) ; therefore there is a gain of 3! in the formulas. The present 
work, despite the use of Hilbert schemes, will only deal with non refined formulas. 
However, all the demonstrations of triple formulas use general hypotheses on the 
morphism f, essentially the regularity of some "derivative" applications. See also the 
paper by Colley [Co]. 
0.4 
The goal of the first part of this book is to establish the triple formula without any 
hypotheses on the genericity of f. Of course, one must immediately : 
(i) make it clear that this requires to choose an ad hoc definition of m3, 
(ii) emphasize that in the degenerate case where the triple locus is too big, the 
formula does not mean much ! 
Looking for the triple locus of f means looking for the set of (xl, x2, x3) of V â€¢ V x V 
such that f(xl) = f(x2) = f(x3). Once again, one wishes to eliminate the solutions 
with Xl = x2 or x2 = x3 or x3 = xl. One must find a "good" space of triples for 
V : a space where the locus to be eliminated is a Cartier's divisor. In [KL1], Kleiman 
uses the space 'gilb 2(V) x v'Hilb2(Y) where 'Hilb 2(V) denotes the universal two- 
sheeted cover of Hilb2(V). In [Ro], Ronga blows-up in gilb2(V) x Y the tautological 
~Hilb2(V). Our suggestion here is to use the space H3(V) of completely ordered triples 
of V, introduced in [LB1], which is birational to V x V x V. Let us recall briefly the 
construction of H3(V) : 
An element t = (Pl,P2,P3, d12, d23, d31, t) in the product V 3 â€¢ [Hilb2(V)] 3 â€¢ Hilb3(V) 
is a complete triple if it verifies the relations : 
{ p~ C dii C t 
( scheme-theoretic inclusions ) 
Pi = Res(p~, dii) 
p~: = Res(d~i,t ) 
with 
{i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} 

where Res(7 h ~) denotes the residual closed point of the (h - 1)-uplet U contained in 
the k-uplet ~. 
The motivation is that this space appears to be more natural, in view of the action 
of the symmetric group $3. However, one must realize that one ends up computing in 
~Hilb2(V) x V in the process of the demonstration. In particular, the origin of the 2 j 
that one finds in the triple formula stems from the computation (see w 3.2.4) of the 
virtual normal bundle of the morphism 'Hilb2(V) --+ Hilb2(V), that one already finds 
in [KL1] and [Ro]. 
0.5 
Once the space of triples we work with has been chosen, we work along the same lines 
as Ran [Ra] and Gaffney [Ga]: 
(i) if X C Z is a non-singular subvariety of a non-singular variety Z, one gives the 
A 
fundamental class [H3(X)] in the Chow ring CH~ 
(theorem 3). 
(ii) if f : V --+ W is a morphism, one defines the triple class m 3 e CH~ 
as the 
direct image of the cycle 
A 
A 
A 
M3 = [H3(rs)]. [H3(V) x W] 
e 
CH'(H3(V x W)) 
where Ff is the graph of f. Tedious but straightforward computations lead to the 
triple formula (theorem 4). 
However, one must realize that in the case where the morphism f has S2-singularities, 
the scheme-theoretic intersection H3(r/)n (H3(V) x W) c H3(V â€¢ W) has automat- 
ically excess components. This makes the interpretation of the formula tricky. In 
enumerative geometry, one often gives a formula which is valid in general, even if one 
must explain afterwards how many "improper" solutions must be removed in order 
to find the number of "proper" solutions. We have chosen to follow this approach, 
i.e. we provide a formula which is valid in general, but we are aware that the second 
half of our task would be to interpret this formula in the degenerate cases, which one 
cannot avoid. This is done in a preliminary way in chapter 5, where one considers 
the simplest case where f : V ~ W is a morphism from a surface to a volume with 
S2-singularity. 
0.6 
The second part of this book is devoted to the construction of a variety of complete 
quadruples in order to define a class m4 in the Chow ring CH~ 
The goal is 
to construct a "good" space of completely ordered quadruples of V, in which the 
locus to be eliminated is a Cartier's divisor. To do so, one wishes to generalize the 

4 
Introduction 
A 
construction of the variety Ha(V) of the complete triples. Therefore, the question is to 
construct naturally a variety H4(V) consisting of ordered quadruples of V, possessing 
a birational morphism : 
A 
H4(V) --+ V â€¢ V â€¢ V â€¢ V 
compatible with the action of the symmetric group $4, and an order-forgetting mor- 
phism : 
H4(V) --+ Hilb4(V) 
The construction of this variety must also be compatible with closed imbeddings : 
if V C W is a subvariety of W, then H4(V) can be identified with a subvariety of 
H4(W).

A naive generalization

H~a~,,e(V ) of the construction of H3(V) is not sufficient, as 
was already pointed out by Fulton ([FU1]). The variety 
4 
H~,,,~,,,~(V) is defined as a 
subvariety of the product V 4 x [Hilb2(V)] 6 x [Hilba(V)] 4 x Hilb4(V). To do this, one 
introduces the following notation : 
Notation 1 : If ~ is a point in Hilbd(V), one will denote by Z~ the ideal sheaf of Ov 
which defines the corresponding subscheme. 
An element (PI, P2, P3, P4, d12, d13, d14, d23, d24, d34, tl, t2, t3, t4, q) in the above product 
is a complete nai've quadruple if it verifies the relationships :

Unfortunately, 
4 
H,,,,~,,~.(V) is reducible and singular. We will see below that the condi- 
tions (.) introduce excess components. 
Recall [I2, F] that (for dimV = 3) the Hilbert scheme Hilb4(V) is irreducible and 
singular at the quadruplets q of ideal A/I, 2 where 2~4 v is the ideal of a closed point p 
of V. Consider the subvariety R(V) of Hilb2(V) â€¢ Hilb4(V) â€¢ HilbZ(V) consisting of 
elements (d, q, d') satisfying the relations : 
The variety R(V) possesses a projection onto Hilb4(V), which we denote by II. We 
will see (chapter 6) that R(V) is reducible : R(V) is the union of two irreducible 

components, one of which dominates Hilb4(V) by II. When dim V = 3, for example, 
we will see that the non dominant excess component is smooth of dimension 8. We 
will give a geometric description of this extra component (w 6.4.2, p. 100). The other 
component, of dimension 12 (= dim Hilb4(V)), is the closure of the graph of the 
residual rational application Res, which is defined below. Let us first introduce the 
following definition : 
Definition 1 : One defines the incidence variety I(V) as subvariety of the product 
Hilb2(V) x gilb4(V) by the condition: 
(d, q) E I(V) if and only if d is subscheme of q. 
The second projection 
II2: 
I(V) 
--+ gilb4(V) 
(d,q) ~-~ q 
is generically a 6 = / 4 /-sheeted Cover. 
\ 2 ] 
Definition 2 : A triplet t C V is said to be amorphous (cf. [KL4]) if its support is 
reduced to only one point p and if the ideal of t is the square of the ideal of p in a 
germ of a smooth surface containing p. 
In this variety I(V), the complementary doublet of d in q is not always well defined. 
Indeed, let W be the locally closed subvariety of I(V) consisting of elements (d, q) 
such that : 
-q is the union of an amorphous triplet t of support p and a simple point m 
distinct from p, 
- 
d is the simple doublet p U m. 
At such elements (d, q) = (pUm, tUrn) of I(V), one cannot define the complementary 
doublet d' because the closed point p does not define canonically a doublet d ~ in the 
amorphous triplet t (cf. [ELB]). However, outside of W, the closure of W in I(V), 
one can always define the complementary doublet d I of d in q. One gives the following 
definition of the residual rational application : 
Definition 3 : Let Res be the residual rational application : 
Res : I(V) 
... ~ 
Hilb:(V) 
(d,q) ...-+ d'=q \ d 
where d ~ denotes the "other" doublet, once the doublet d in q has been fixed. The 
ideal which defines the subscheme d' of V is given by the ideal Ann(Zd/Zq) of Or. 
Then this ideal verifies the inclusions : 

6 
Introduction 
Let U denote the open subset of I(V) on which the residual rational application Res 
is well defined. The open set U contains the dense open subset (cf. proposition 3) 
consisting of elements (d, q) such that the quadruplet q is a simple quadruplet. 
Definition 4 : If Resu denotes the restriction of the rational application Res to U, 
the graph of the regular application Resu : U --+ Hilb2(V) is called the graph of the 
rational application Res. 
Then, the inclusion 
r~.(= rRo,u) c u â€¢ Hilb2(V) 
holds. 
Then the subvariety R(V) of Hilb2(V) â€¢ Hilb4(V) â€¢ Hilb2(V), whose elements 
(d, q, d') satisfy the inclusions 
contains FR~, the graph of the application Res : 
FR~., C R(V) C Hilb2(V) â€¢ Hilb4(y) â€¢ HiIb2(V) 
Therefore, this subvariety R(V) contains FR~.,, the closure of Pa~, in the product 
Hilbe(V) â€¢ Hilb4(V) â€¢ HiIb2(V). The following notation is then introduced : 
Notation 2 : Let B(V) -- FR,s be the closure of the graph of the rational application 
Res. One has the inclusions B(V) C R(V) c Hilb2(y) â€¢ Hilb4(V) x Hilb2(V). The 
variety R(V) possesses a projection 1-I onto Hilb4(Y). Its restriction to B(V) will be 
denoted by zr. If q E Hilb4(V) is a quadruplet, ~ will denote a~ element of the fiber 
7r-l(q) C B(V) : 
B(V) 
C R(V) 
q Hilb4(V) 
It will be shown in chapter 6 that the variety B(V) is irreducible, smooth, of 
dimension 4 9 dim V. The tool for the proof consists in using local coordinates for 
Hilb2(V) and Hilb4(V) in order to give local equations for B(V). 
0.8 
Let us see how a construction of the variety of complete quadruples as subvariety of 
the product [Ha(V)] 4 x [B(V)] 6 appeared to be natural to us. Consider the simple 

quadruplet q E Hilb4(V), which is the union of four distinct points Pl,P2,P3,P4 of V. 
The element ~ in H4(V) constructed from the point (pl,p2,P3,P4) of V 4 consists in 
the data of : 
- the four complete triples t1,/2,t3,t4 of H3(--~), constructed from the triplets 
tl, t2, t3, t4 contained in the quadruplet q. (The notation t~ means that the triplet t~ 
is disjoint from the simple point Pi.) The complete triple t, corresponds to the point 
(Pl,''' 
,Pi,' "' ,P4) of V 3 ; 
- the six elements (d~j, q, d~j){i,j}c{1,2,3,4} of B(V) constructed from q, where d~j 
denotes the simple doublet which is the union of the two points p~,pj, and d'ij is the 
residual doublet of d~j in the quadruplet q.

points satisfy the conditions : p~ = Res(t,, q) and P4 = Res(t4, q). 
Chapter 7 will be devoted to the construction of this variety. As before, the con- 
struction of this subvariety H4(V) C [H3(V)] 4 â€¢ [B(V)] 6 will be completely explicit. 
We will see that such a construction enables us to remove the excess components of 
4 
H~,,,i.,,,~(V) (defined in 0.7). The variety H4(V) constructed in this way is irreducible 
but unfortunately it is still singular. 
A geometric description of the singular locus of H4(V) will be given in section 7.2.1.

Fundamental facts 
If X is a non-singular C-variety, its Chow ring graded by the codimension is denoted 
by CH'(X). If a E CH'(X), {a} k denotes the part of codimension k. Of course, 
these two rules apply : 
(~1) If X is of pure codimension r, then 
x. {a} k = {x. a} k+r 
(T~2) If f : X -~ X' is a proper morphism and if cod(f) denotes dimX' - dimX, 
then : 
f,{a) k _- {f,a)k+cod(l) 
The part of dimension k of a E CH~ 
graded by the dimension, will be also denoted 
by {a}~:. Note that : 
(T~3) If f is a proper morphism, 
f,{a}k = {f,a}k 
1.2 
Conventions 
From [FU2], p. 13, if ~ : Y ~ 
Y' is the canonical imbedding of a subvariety and 
a E CH~ 
one will often write a in CH~ 
instead of ~,a, which would be more 
correct. 
The fundamental class of a variety X is denoted by IX] or sometimes by 1. Im- 
properly but for the sake of simplicity, from w 3.2.4 on, if Y C Y' is a subvariety, one 
will denote by Y and not by [Y], the class of the associated cycle in CH~ 
Finally, one writes "from (FP)" each time one uses the projection formula :

An element d of H2(--"X) can be identified with a couple (Pl, d) consisting of a point 
and a doublet containing this point. One can denote by P2 
= 
Res(pl,d) the "other 
point" (see [LB1]). One has a natural isomorphism: 
A 
H2(X) ~ 
X x X 
with the blowing-up X x X along the diagonal, which commutes with the projections 
onto X. This is why one will also write d = (Pl, P2, d). 
In H2(X), there is the "exceptional" divisor F, consisting of the couple (Pl, d) with 
supp(d) reduced to only one point ; it corresponds to the exceptional divisor of X â€¢ X 
via the above mentioned isomorphism. Finally, one checks that : 
F is the locus of ramification of the cover 0 : H2(--'-X) ~ 
H2(X) .

The class of H2(X) in H2(Z) 
Let Z be a non-singular variety of dimension z and j : X ~-+ Z the canonical imbed- 
ding of a subvariety of dimension x. One can identify in a natural way the variety 
H2(X) of dimension 2x with a subvariety of H2(Z), which is of dimension 2z. Our 
purpose is to compute the fundamental class [H2(X)] in CH'(H2(Z)). 
Let 111 and 112 : H2(Z) -~ Z denote the two canonical morphisms. 
In I = 
111-1(X) N l12-1(X) one has the excess component: 
7) = F A III-I(x) = F N 112-1(X) 
where F C H2(Z) denotes, as said already, the exceptional divisor of H2(Z). The 
component 7) consists of the (d, pl) with supp(d) = pl E X. 
Let us consider the commutative diagram where the restriction 11qn~-l(x) is de- 
noted by H/I and the other arrows are the canonical imbeddings (the parentheses 
indicate the dimensions) :

From [FU2], theorem 9.2, p. 161 and corollary 9.2.2, p. 163, one has in CH2~(I) : 
[H2(---'X)] = [IIx-I(X)] 9 [II2-1(X)] - {ci. a,s(I), H2-i(x))}2,~ , 
where g -- g[v(IIl-l(X), g2(--"~)) is the restriction of the normal bundle to III-I(x) 
in H2(Z). 
Hypothesis 1 : From now on, one assumes that the total Chern class cu(X, Z) of 
the normal bundle at X in Z can be written as j*d where d E CH~ 
Since H I and H2 are fiat morphisms (see (4.5) and (4.6) in w 4.2), one has: 
[II,-i(x)] = H*[X] 
i = 1, 2 
(2.1) 
Moreover, the normal bundle v(IIl-l(x), H~)) 
can by identified with Hi*u(X , Z). 
Hence the total Chern class N is :

Proof : 
See (4.20) in section 4.6. 
[] 
As a result, one gets the equality between Segre classes (inverse of Chern classes) : 
gu.a.s( 7), 112-1(X)) = i~s( F, He(Z)) 
Notation 
a : One writes s(F) for s(F, H2(-'-'Z)) and s(7)) for s(7:), II2-1(X)). 
Considering the above results, one can rewrite in CH2~(11e-1(X)) : 
ge,{cN, a,s(~)}e,~ = ge,{giilnle, a,s(~))e~

Finally the formula in CH2Z-2~'(H~)) 
[g2(-~)] = [111-1(X)]. [I12-1(X)] - {111c' 
follows.

Moreover, equation (2.1) 
yields [11i-1(X)1 = 11"[X1. 
Therefore we have shown the following theorem (Ran IRa], p. 90, with k = 2) : 
Theorem 
1 (Ran) Let j : X r 
Z be the canonical imbedding of a smooth subvari- 
ety of dimension x in a smooth variety of dimension z. Assume that the total Chern 
class cu(X, Z) of the normal bundle can be written as j'd, where d E tiff(Z). 
If [I1, 1112 : H2(Z) ---+ Z are the two natural morphisms, then one has in CH'( H2( Z) ) 
the equality : 
[He(X)] _- 111IX]- (11~[X] - {s(F). 111c'F -~) 
where s(F) denotes the Segre class s(F, He(Z)) of the exceptional divisor.

Definition of the double class 
From now on, let f:V ----+ W be a morphism of fixed proper smooth varieties, of 
respective dimensions n and m. Let k = m - n = cod(f). 
Hypothesis 2 : 
(i) Assume rn > n (i.e. k > 0). 
(ii) Assume 2n - m _> 0 (i.e. 
k _< n) , so that the classes defined below are 
meaningful. 
Let F be the graph of f and j : F ~-~ V â€¢ W be the canonical imbedding. As in 
A 
w 2.1, H2(F) can be identified with a subvariety of codimension 2m of H2(V x W). 
Moreover, one has an imbedding 
: H~(V) â€¢ W ~ H~(V â€¢ w) 
defined canonically. Thus, if d C V is a doublet and w a point of W, then a(d, w) 
denotes the doublet image of d by the imbedding

Definition of the double class 
17 
One says that m2 is the "double class". 
Remark 1 : The cycle M2 corresponds to the idea of points vl, v2 of V having the 
same image by f ; while the cycle m2 corresponds to the idea of points Vl E V such 
that there exists v2 E V having the same image as vl. 
The question is to evaluate m2 in CH~:(V). To do so, one introduces some new 
notation : 
Notation 4 : 
(i) If g : X 
~ Y is a morphism, one denotes by .q and g' the two following 
morphisms : 
= 
gxidw 
: XxW 
~ 
YxW 
g' 
= 
g x idy 
: 
X x V

(ii) One denotes by prl and pr2 the projections from V x W onto V and W, respec- 
tively. 
(iii) One denotes by Pl and P2 the two projections from V x V onto V. Note that 
Pl : idv x pr2 : V x V x W ---+ V x W 
A 
(iv) Let us denote by 7ri : H2(V) 
~ V the morphism which sends ((vl, v2), d) onto 
v~, fori = 1,2. Then one denotes by 7r : H2(V) ~ 
V x V the morphism 
(Th, 7r2). Note that rr can be identified with the blowing-up of the diagonal of 
VxV. 
(v) One denotes by Pw : H2(V) x W ~ 
W the natural projection. 
(vi) Last, as said above, if F is the graph of f, one denotes by j : F ~-+ V x W the 
canonical imbedding. One has inverse isomorphisms : 
7:V-7-~F 
and 
cr:r 
~>V 
With this notation, one has a commutative diagram :

2.3.1 
Computation of M2 
Let us apply theorem 1 with X = F, Z = V x W and d = pr~cW, where cW denotes 
the total Chern class of the tangent bundle TW to W. Indeed, the normal bundle to 
the graph is identified with j*pr~TW. For x = n, z = n + m, the formula of theorem 1 
gives in CH~ 
x W)) : 
[H2(r)] = II~[r]. (rib[r] - {s(~) 9 ri~c'}'-) 
where ~ C H2(-V-~xW) denotes the exceptional divisor. 
But one has the commutative diagram :

where F denotes in this case the exceptional divisor of H2(V). (This comes from 
A 
the fact that F and H2(V) â€¢ W intersect transversally in H2(V â€¢ W), as shown by a 
computation on coordinates (4.32) performed in w 4.10). 
It finally leads to the equality in CH~ 
x W)) : 
M2 = a*[H2(r)] = 73*~F[F]. (73"~2"[F] - {s(F) â€¢ cW} m) 
(2.2) 
Note that a*s(~) = s(F) since the Segre classes are the inverse of the total Chern 
classes of the normal bundles. 
2.3.2 
Let us apply the projection formula to the morphism 73 : 
73,M2 = ~,*[V l 9 73.(73%*[F l - {s(F) â€¢ cW}'). 
Since 73 is birational, 73,1 = 1. Hence, since 73 = 7r x idw and from (FP) : 
73,M2 =/51"[F]. (/52"[F] - {Tr, s(F) x cW}'). 
(we have used ('R2) with cod(73) = 0). 
But 7r-l(Ay) = F where Av C V â€¢ V denotes the diagonal. From [FU2], propo- 
sition 4.2.5, one has 7c.s(F) = s(Av). Hence the equality in CH'(V â€¢ Y â€¢ W) 
73.M2 =/3,'[F]. (/~2"[F] - {s(Ay) x cW} m) 

20 
Double formula 
holds. 
This time let us apply the projection formula to the morphism/31. Since cod(~i) = 
-n, we get by (7/2) the equality in CH'(V x W) 
;6i,#,M2 = [C]. (i~i,/52*[F] - {;i,s(Ay) x cW} ...... ). 
But the commutative diagram 
VxV 
Av 
' 
V 
yields pl,s(Av) = c(V) -i, the inverse total Chern class of V, since the normal bundle 
to A v can be identified with the tangent bundle to V. 
Notation 
5 : One writes 
~ : 
c(V) -1 X cW E CH'(V x W). 
Notation 
6 : Let 
# = #1 - #2 in CHk(V x W), 
where 
#i=/5i,/32"[F] 
and 
#2={~} ~, 
Using the previous notation and the fact that m - n = k, one gets : 
pl,~,M2 = [V]. (~1,/32"[F1 - {~}~) = [r].~ 
(2.3) 
From remark 2, one has in CH~'(V) : m2 = prl,~l,~r, M2 = pri,([F]. #). This is also 
(from (FF) applied to j) : m2 = pra,(j,j*#) = 7*J*# car prl,j, = a, = 7*. Hence: 
m2 = 7*J*# 
in 
CHk(V) 
(2.4) 
We will need the following lemma : 
Lemma 2 Let a E CIt'(V x W). Then one has the equality/31,/32"a = pr~pr2,a. 
Proof : 
By the construction of 132, one has/52"a = [Y] x a E CH'(V x V x W). Also, 
/31 = idv x pr2. Hence pl,/52*a = [V] x pr2,a = pr~pr2,a. 
[] 
2.3.3 
We saw (equation (2.4)) that m2 = 7*J*# = 7*J*/zi - 7"J*#2 (using notation 6). 
Let us first compute 7"j*#1, i.e. 3,*j*igl,/52*[r ]. 

Computation of the double class 
21 
From the previous lemma, 7*J*#l = 7*j*pr~pr2,[r] = f*pr2,[r], since f = pr2 o j o 7. 
Moreover, since f, = pr2,j,7,, one has : 
pr2,[r] = f,[Y]. 
(2.5) 
Therefore, we have shown that : 
7*J*#l =f*f,[V] 
in 
CH~:(V) 
(2.6) 
Let us now compute 7*J*#z, i.e. 7*j*{~} ~:. 
We have let ~ = c(V) -1 x cWin CH'(V â€¢ W). But it can also be written as~= 
pr~c(V) -1. pr~cW. Hence j*~ = j*pr~c(V) -1. j*pr~cW. 
But prl oj 
= a andpr2oj 
= foa. 
Hence j*~ = a*(c(V) -1. f*cW), and 
consequently : 
= 
-1 
. f*cW) 
Notation 
7 : In the Grothendieck's group K(V), let us denote by 
u(f) = f*TW- 
TV 
, 
the virtual normal bundle to f. One denotes by ci the Chern classes of u(f). 
Since cu(f) = f*cW. c(V) -1, one gets: 
= 
(2.7) 
Finally, 7*~r* = identity leads to 
7"j'#2 = 7"J'{~} k = 7*a'ek = ck. 
(2.8) 
It follows that : 
m2 = 7*j*(#l - t22) = f'f,[V] - ck. 
We have just proved again the following theorem : 
Theorem 
2 (Laksov) Let f 
: V 
~ 
W be a morphism of proper and smooth 
varieties, with dim W = k + dim Y (k > 0). Let m2 E CHk(V) be the "double class", 
direct image of 
M2 = [g2(r)] 9 [g:(Y) â€¢ W] 
9 
cI-r(H2(V x W)) 
where F is the graph of f. Then one has the double formula : 
m2 = f* f,[V] - ck 
where c~: is the U h Chern class of the virtual normal bundle f*TW - TV.

The class of H3(X) in H3(Z) 
Let Z be a smooth variety of dimension z. One introduces in [LB1] the smooth variety 
A 
H3(Z), of dimension 3z, of "complete triples". Below we recall briefly its construction. 
Notation 8 : Let us denote by H'(Z) the Hilbert scheme Hilb'(Z) (cf. [G], [I1]). 
A complete triple of Z consists of the data t -- (p1,P2,pa, d12, d23, d31,t) E Z a x 
(H2(Z)) 3 x H3(Z) where 
{ p~ C d~j C t 
( scheme-theoretic inclusions ) 
pj = Res(p,, d{j) 
p~ = Res(d,j,t) 
with {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3} 
A 
Let us denote by H3(Z) the set of complete triples of Z. We show that it is a non- 
A 
singular variety, birational to Z x Z x Z. In the case where Z = 1 ~2, the variety H3(~ 2) 
is canonically isomorphic to the Semple's complete triangles variety IS], since studied 
by Roberts-Speiser [RS1]. 
One has in H3(Z) for Cartier's divisors : 
E12---- {t[ d23--= d31} 
E23=-{ttd12=d31} 
and 
E ~ 
E31 : { t[ d23 -~ d12} 
Recall that (cf. definition 2) an amorphous triplet t is such that supp(t) is reduced 
to only one point p and t is defined by the square of the ideal of p in a germ of a 
smooth surface containing p. 
Then let j 
: X ~ 
Z be the canonical imbedding of a smooth subvariety of 
A 
dimension x. The variety H3(X) can clearly be identified with a subvariety of H3(Z), 
as one sees by coordinate computations (see (4.30) in w 4.9).

The class of H3(X) in H3(Z)

The question is to evaluate the fundamental class of [H3(X)] E CH~ 
with the same hypothesis as in w 2.1, i.e. cv(X, Z) = j*d where d e CH~ 
Let 
P~ : H3(Z) 
--+ Z 
~ 
p~ 
be the three natural morphisms. A computation (see (4.25) in w 4.7) shows that the 
P~ are flat. Similarly, one has the morphism 
A 
P12 : H3(Z) 
~ 
H2(Z) 
[ 
~ 
(Pl, d12) 
and a computation (see (4.23)) shows that P12 is flat. 
Then the intersection 
I -= P~21(H-~((X)) N pal(x) 
in H3(-'-~) possesses three 
excess components, respectively 
C23 = E23 VI pI~I(H'~)), 
C31 = E31 VI P~I(H"~)), 
E ~ = E ~ V~ P~I(H--~)).

Spec(C[T]/(T2)) is represented by:

P3 
The restriction of P3 to P31(X) is denoted by _P~. From IFU2], corollary 9.2.2, one 
has the equality in CH'(I) : 
[H3('-'~)] ---- [P~t(H--~))]- [P~-t(X)]- {cN. a,s(E, p1~1(H'5~)))}3~, 
where g = g*v(P31(X), H-~(Z)). 
But P3 is flat (see (4.25)), so g = g*P~*v(X, Z). 
Then, since by hypothesis cv(X, Z) = j'd, one has : eN = g*P~*j*d = i'*h*P~d. 
Moreover, P12 and/)3 are flat morphisms (see (4.23) and (4.25)), therefore 
{ [P~I(H--~))] = 
P12*[H2(~-X)] 
(3.1) 
[P3-'(X)] = 
P3*[X] 
Moreover, one has the following lemma

[] 
Notation 10 : One writes s(E) for s(E, H3(--~)) and also s(s for s(s P121(H-~))). 
Using what is above, one writes in CH3~,(PZ*(H-~"X))) : 
i ~ fi,*h*p*,v 
=

{h*P~d.i',a,s(s

the dimension 3x 
is equivalent to the codimension z - x.) 
= 
h*{P;d, s(E)} 
.... 
Afortiori, we get in CH3~(H3(--~)) = CH 3~ 3*'(H--~(Z)) : 
h, il,{cg 9 a,s(E)}3, 
= 
h,h*{P~d, s(E)} ~-*

Finally the formula in CHa~-a~'(H-~(Z)) 
[H3(--~)] = [P~I(H--~))]. ([p3-I(x)]- {P~e'. s(E)} z-*) 
follows. 
But we noticed that P12 and P3 are flat ; with the help of (3.1), we have therefore 
proved the following theorem (which generalizes Ran [Ra], p. 90 for k = 3) : 
Theorem 3 Let j : X ~-+ Z be the canonical imbedding of a smooth subvariety of 
dimension x in a smooth variety of dimension z. Suppose that the total Chern class 
cv(X, Z) of the normal bundle can be written as j*d where d E CH'(Z). Let P12 and

Then the equality in CI-I" ( H3 ( Z ) ) follows :

consists of the "horizontal" triplets of V x W.

~.tt, ~)

Let us denote by P~' : H3(---~) x W ~ 
V the morphism which takes (i, w) to vl, 
where [ = (t, d12, d23, d31, vl, v2, v3) is in H3(~"V). 
If F is the graph of f, the diagram 
H3(-~) ~ H3(V-""~W) ~ H-~(V) x W ~ V 
follows. 
Definition 6 : With the above notation, let

m-'-~ is said to be the "triple class". 
Remark 3 : As in remark 2, the cycle M3 corresponds intuitively to points Vl, v2, 
v3 of V having the same image by f; while the cycle m33 corresponds intuitively to 
points Vl 9 V such that there exists v2, v3 in V having the same image as vl. 

The triple formula 
27 
The question is to evaluate ~ 
in CH2k(V). To do so, we introduce some addi- 
tional notation besides the morphisms considered in w 2.2 : 
Notation 11 : 
A 
(i) Let q : H2(V) x V ----+ H2(V) be the natural projection ; 
(ii) Let 
w~ : H2(V) x V 
--+ V 
i=1,2,3 
where d = (vl,v2, d) e H2(--"V). Note the asymmetric role of 3 in comparison 
with 1 and 2 in this notation. 
(iii) Let us denote by Pw : H3(V) x W ----+ W the natural projection. 
(iv) Let r be the birational morphism 
r 
H3(V) 
~ 
H~(V) â€¢ V 
i 
~ 
((vl, v2, d~), v3) 
if [ = (t, d12, d23, d31, Vl, v2, v3). 
(v) The imbedding/3 : H3(V) x W '-~ H3(V x W) has been defined above. 
(vi) Recall (see notation 4.(i)) that .~ denotes g â€¢ idw, where g is a morphism. 
With this notation (in addition to the notation of w 2.2), one has a commutative 
diagram :

Remark 4 : With this notation, one has

3.2.2 
Computation 
of M3 and r 
In the same way as in w 2.3 with theorem 1, one applies theorem 3 with X = F, 
Z = V â€¢ W and d = pr~cW. Theorem 3 yields the equality in CH'(H3(~â€¢ W)) : 
[H3(F)] = P~*2[H2(F)] 9 (P~[r]- {s(~). P~c'}'") 
, 
where ~ is E23 + E31 + E'. The double bar denotes the divisors related to H3(~x W). 
The divisors related to H3(V) are denoted by E = E23+E31+E', so that ;3"(~) = E â€¢ 
[W] by transversality (cf. (4.33) in w 4.10). The definition of M3 (see definition 6.(a)) 
yields : 
A 
M3 = ;3*P~*2[H2(P)] 9 (;3*P3*[r] - {(s(~) x [w])./3*p~c'}") 
On the other hand, as it can be checked easily, pr2 o P3 o ;3 = Pw. Therefore

Furthermore, as it can be seen on the previous diagram 4,/3"P1" 2 = r 
Moreover, 
one verifies easily that Pa o/3 = o., 
a o r Therefore fl*P~ = r 
Finally, one has in CH*(Ha(V) x W) : 
M3 = 
~*(]*o~'[H2(-~)]

Let us then apply the projection formula to the birational morphism r = r x idw. 
Since cod(qS) = 0 and (~,r 
= id, one has from (7~2) : 
&M3 
= 
- 
x cW}") 
Let us then introduce some additional notation. 
(3.3) 
Notation 12 : 
(a) Let | 
: U 
) H2(V) be the universal two-sheeted covering and R C U its 
ramification locus. One has U C H2(V) x V. Of course, it is the same as 
0 : H2(V) ---+ H2(V), but we denote it differently in order to avoid any 
confusion. 
Similarly, R C U corresponds to F C H2(V) and it is the ramification locus of 
0 (see w 1.3). 
(b) Let 0' = 0 x idv. One constructs the cartesian diagram (where 0" is the restric- 
tion of 0' and u, ~ are the canonical imbeddings) : 
0 r 
u 
, H2(-"-'V) â€¢ V 
0" 
0' 
U 
U c 
, H2(V) â€¢ V 
(c) Let Gla and G2a be the graphs in H2(V) â€¢ V of the natural morphisms : 
Pi: 
H2(V) 
--+ 
V 
((vl,v2),d) 
v,. 
(d) Let t3 C F â€¢ V be the graph of PIIF : F ~ 
V. 
(e) We denote by D C H2(V) the set consisting of the doublets of support one 
point. 

3O 
(f) 
Triple formula 
The Segre class s(U, H~) 
x V) (resp. s(U, H2(V) â€¢ V)) is denoted by s(U) 
(resp. s(u)). 
See drawing in w 3.2.4, page 43. 
Lemma 4 
(i) One has the inverse scheme theoretic image 
r 
= E in H~). 
(ii) One has the equality of schemes 
U = G13 U G23 in H2(---"V) x V. 
(iii) One has the equality of schemes 
B = G13 N G23 in H2(V) x V. 
(iv) One has the equality 
0*[D] = 2[F] in CHI(H-~)). 
(v) One also has the equality 
0'*[R] = 2[B] in CI-F(H2(V) x V). 
Proof: 
The proof consists in computing coordinates ; the results are shown in chapter 4 
(see resp. (4.28), (4.15), (4.13), (4.9) and (4.16)). 
[] 
Lemma 4.(i) in conjunction with prop. 4.2.a, p. 74 in [FU2] shows that the direct 
image by r of the Segre class s(E) is given by : 
r 
= s(U) 
in CH'(H2(~-V) x V). 
(3.4) 
Equation (3.3) implies the final result in CH'(H2(V) x V x W): 
~,M3 
= 
~*~*[H2(~-~)]. (~'[r] - {s(0) â€¢ cwy"). 
(3.5) 
Let us introduce some more notation. 
Notation 
13 : Let 
where 
Remark 4 implies : 
A 
r 
= v = vl - ~2 
C 
CH'(H2(V) x V x W) 
vl = ~*~*[H2(r)]. ~*[r]

3.2.3 
Computation of prl,~,ul 
As it can be seen on diagram 4, one has ~ = Pl o 7r o q ; one first calculates ~,Ul = 
PI,~,~,vl. 
The definition of ul (notation 13) and the application of (FP) to ~ yield : 
A 
q,//1 
: 
a*[H2(r)] 
9 4,~,[r] 
But W~3 : H2(V) x V x W ----+ V x W simply is the natural projection. Therefore : 
~*[P] = [H2(V)] x [F] 
9 
CH'(H2(V) x V x W) 
, 
A 
and since ~ is the natural projection H2(V) x V â€¢ W 
) H2(V) â€¢ W, one has : 
A 
~,w"~'[s 
x pr2,[F] . 
But we have seen that pr2,[F] = f,[V] (see equality (2.5)). Therefore ~,W~*[F] can 
also be written as : 
A 
~*~* 
* 
[H2(V)] x f,[V] = 7r*p-~*(iV] x/,IV]) 
= 
lr Pi pr2f,[V] 
We finally obtain 
c/,., = a*[H2(r)] 
9 ~ pl i'DT2f*[ v] 
Applying (FP) to ~ o # yields in CH'(V x W) : 
A 
~"i,Vl = ~,#,~,Ul 
= p~,#,a*[H2(r)] 9 pr;f,[Y]. 
A 
But we let (definition 5): M2 = a*[H2(r)]. The equalities (2.3) yield: 
p'i,7?,[m2] = [s 
9 
CH'(V x W) 
Therefore 
w~,,l = IF]. ff.pr~f,[V]. 
But, for all a 9 CH'(V x W), (FP) gives: 
j,j*a = a. IF] 
(3.7) 
Therefore 
w~,,l = j,j*(t~" pr~f,[Y]). Since a = prl o j, one has: 
prl,w~,,l = a,j*(t~' pr~f,[Y]) 
But 7" = a, (since 7 (resp. or) is the inverse isomorphism of cr (resp. 7)). It follows 
that : 
prl,U~l,Vl = 7*J*#" 7*J*Pr]f*[ V] 
On one hand, 7*J*# = m2 (see (2.4)) ; on the other hand, f = pr2 o j o 7. Thus we 
have obtained what we were looking for :

Computation 
of {s(U) â€¢ cW} m 
We already mentioned in the introduction that the notation is abused in the following 
way : if Y C Y' is a subvariety, the class in CH*(Y') is denoted by Y and not by [Y]. 
a) In the following calculations, we need to know 
s(U) â€¢ cW 
e 
OH'(H2(I-V) x V x W) 
, 
or more exactly (see w 1.2): ~2,s(U) x cW , 
where t2 : s(&) r 
H2(----~) x V is the canonical imbedding. But one has (notation 12) 
a commutative diagram :

where w3 and ~-~ are the natural projections on the second factor and i5, p are their 
restrictions; ~ is the projection on the first factor. | is the two-sheeted universal 
covering. (We denote it by (9 : U ~ 
H2(V) and not by 0 : H2(V) ~ 
H2(V), 
A 
since U is another copy of H2(V), in order to avoid any confusion. Same thing for 
and q). 
Notation 14 : In order to simplify the notation, one writes H for H2(V). 
b) 
Lemma 5 (Kleiman, Ronga) : Let v be the normal bundle to U in H â€¢ V. Then one 
has in CH'(U) the total Chern class : 
l+2R 
c(v) =p*c(TY). 1 + R 
where TV is the tangent bundle to V and R is the ramification locus of U on H. 
Proof: 
From [HI, II, prop. 8.12, one has the exact sequence of sheaves on U : 
sis ~ 
> a~,i~ | o~ -~ r~i. --+ 0 

The triple formula 
33 
where I = Ou(-R) is the ideal of R. Then 
I/P = I e ou/I -~ o~(-n) 
Furthermore, (see (4.10) in w 4.3), the projection R ----9 H is not ramified, i.e. ~I/H = 
0. Thus one obtains the isomorphism ~/H "~ OR(--R). Let us apply again [H], II, 
prop. 8.12 but this time to the morphism ~. One obtains the exact sequence of sheaves 
onU: 
O----+ v* -"~ q ~V [ U ---+ fl~/H 
) 0 
~* denoting the conormal bundle. It follows that in the Grothendieck group K(U) of 
coherent sheaves (or vector bundles), one has the equality : 
1.1" : p*~]V1 -- OR(_R) 
. 
From the exact sequence of sheaves on U : 
0 ~ 
OU(12R) ~ 
Ou(-F~ ) ~ 
OR(--Jt~) ~ 
0 
one obtains in K(U) : 
.* = ;*~vl _ ou(-R) 
+ o~:(-2R) 
. 
The equality of Chern polynomials follows : 
1 - 2tR 
c,(~,*) = ;*c,(~) 
9 i = 
For t = -1, it yields the equality between total Chern classes of duals : 
c(~,) = p*c(TV). 1 + 2R 
1 + R 
E 
CH'(U) . 
Thus, lemma 5 has been shown. 
c) From temma 5, we get inverse Chern classes (by denoting c(TV) by c(V) ) : 
c(~,)_ 1 =p*c(V)- 1

But 1+2~-

Lemma 4.(iv) gives 0*D = 2F in CHI(H--~)); 
which gives | 
= 2R in CHI(U), if rewritten in the other copy U of H2(V). Thus :

l+2R 
One denotes (notation 12.(f)) by s(U) e CH~ 
the Segre class of U C H2(V) x Y. 
From ([FU2], chapter 4), one obtains: 
s(U) = c(~,) -1 = p*c(V) -1. (1 - Ru*~*(1 + D)-') 
e 
CH'(U) . 

34 
Triple formula 
Let us apply (FP) to the morphism u; the equality in CH~ 
x V) 
u,s(U) : ~3*c(V) -1. (U - u,R. ~*(1 + D) -1) 
follows since p* = u*~aa*. 
Let us lift by 0'. From ([FU2], prop. 4.2.5) the equality in CH'(H2(V) x V) 
~,~(0) = 
~,0"*4u) : o'*~,~(u) 
---- co~c(V) -1' (U - O'*R. 0'*~*(1 + 0) -1) . 
follows since 0' is flat (0 is flat). But one has the commutative diagram (q and ~ are 
the two natural projections) : 
H2(V) x V 
q 
, 
H2(V) 
O' 
H~(V) â€¢ V 
~ 
H~(V) 
Thus, one has O'*q*D = q*O*D; but O*D = 2F and O'*R = 2B (cf. 
Therefore, in CH'(H2(V) x V), one has 
u,s(U) -- co~c(Y) -1. (U - 2B(1 Jr. 2q'F) -1) . 
lemma 4). 
(3.9) 
d) Let us then look at {~2,s(0) â€¢ cW}" 9 CH'(H2('~) â€¢ V x W). One can formally 
expand ~2,s(U) given by (3.9) to obtain: 
~,s(O) = ~o~c(V)-' . (0 + B E(-2)"q*s '-1) 
h_~l 
Thus, the equality in CH'(H2(V) x V â€¢ W) 
{(o3~c(V) -1. U) x cW}m --[ - E(-2)h{(o3~c(V) -1. Bq'F h-l) x cW} m 
h> 1 
follows. 
For the first term in this sum, one has in CH'(H2(V) x V x W) : 
(03~c(V) -1. 8) x cW = (co~e(V) 1 x cW) . (U x W) . 
But codim(U x W) = n. Applying (T~I) yields: 
{(~o(v) -1. 0) x cW}" 
: 
{~c(v) -1 x cw} ...... 9 (0 â€¢ w) 
= 
~*{~}~. (O x w) 

The triple formula 
(recall that ~ = c(V) -1 x cW - see notation 5). 
For the other terms of this sum, one has : 
(od~c(V) -1. J~q*F h-l) x cW = (od~c(V) -1 X cW). ((Bq'F h-l) x W) 
But codim(Bq*F h-l) = (n + 1) + (h - 1) = n + h. From (741) again, one has: 
{(0J~c(V) -1. Bq*F h-l) x cW} TM 
= {w~c(V) -1 x cW} ...... h, ((~q, Fh 1) X W) 
= ~3"{~} ~:-h. ((Bq*S h-l) â€¢ W) . 
We have therefore shown the following proposition : 
Proposition 
1 In CH'(H2(V) x V x W), one has the forvnula : 
{~2,s(f)) x cW} m = ~3"{~} k. (U x W) + ~--~(-2)h~33"{~} k-h' ((Bq*F h-l) x W) , 
h_>l 
where ~ = 
c(V) -1 x cW and k = m - n. 
3.2.5 
Computation 
of prl,wl,P2, first part 
a) From notation 13, one has in CH'(H2(V) x V x W) : 
L,2 = ~*a'H2('---F) 9 {~,s(P) x cW} m . 
But one knows that (see (2.2)) : 
A 
a*H~(r) = #*pi*r. (#*p2*r - {s(F) x cW}"*) . 
Moreover, for i = 1, 2, one has 
~ =p;o~o~. 
Since ~ = q x idw, it follows that 
~2 = ~*r. (~*r - {q*s(y) x cWF). {a,s(8) â€¢ cWy" 
Let us then decompose u2, by using the following notation : 
A 
Notation 
15 : Let u2 = ~'~ - u2' e CH'(H2(V) x V x W), where

= 
~l*r. ~-~*r. {~,s(0) â€¢ cw)'-.

b) Let us consider the first term in the sum (3.12) :

(see lemma 4.(ii)) is the union of G13 and G23, the two graphs of the morphisms 
H2(V) 
--+ V 
(va,v2, d) 
w+ v, 
(i=1,2). 
Let us use some additional notation :

Let us first study al and r 
Since on (G13 â€¢ W) the restrictions W'il and 033] are equal, one has : 
31 = ~*(r{~}':). ~'r. 
(c13 â€¢ w). 
Applying (FP) to w-i yields : 
W~.al = F{~}*:. w~'i.(W-~*F 9 (G13 X W)) 
. 
Since (see (3.10)) 
w~ =/7/o 7? o ~ 
for i =1, 2, one has: 
~i,(~*r - (a13 â€¢ w)) = p5,~,~,(~*~*p~*r- (G13 â€¢ W)). 

The triple formula 
37 
i 
But ~,(G13 x W) = [H2(V) â€¢ W] = 1, since Gla is a graph of a morphism from Hz(V) 
to V. Applying (FP) to ~ yields : 
WI,(~2*F ' (G13 â€¢ W)) ~- p~,~,(~-*p'2*F 9 1) = p~,p~*r. 1 
(from (FP) and the fact that # is birational), or pr~pr2,F by lemma 2. 
But one has the equality pr2,F = f,V (see (2.5)). By (3.7), it follows that : 
.
.
.

J,3 ({c} .przf, V ) 
It remains to compute 
prl,wl,al = prl,3,(3 {c}'.J pr2f, V ) 9 
Since prl.j. = or. = 7*, one has : 
p~,~,al 
= ~*j*{~}~:' ~*j*PrU, V. 
On one hand, one has (2.8): 
result 
7*j*{~} k = ck , on the other hand, 7*j*pr~ = f*. The

follows. 
Let us now study a2 and wl,a2. 
Since on G23 â€¢ W, one has the equality w3l = w2I, one obtains : 
a2 = W'il*F" ~*(F{~}k) 9 (G23 X W) 
Therefore one gets from (FP) : 
w~'-{,a2 = F. ~'11,(w'22*(F{~}k) 9 (G23 x W)) 
= r. ~,~,~,(~*~*~*(r{~}~) 
9 (a23 x w)) 
As was done above, we apply (FP) to ~. Since G23 is the graph of a morphism from 
H~(V) to V, it follows that : 
~,[G23 â€¢ W] = [H2(V) â€¢ W] = 1 . 
Next, we apply (FP) to # which is birational. Hence : 
~,az 
= r. ~,~*(r{~} ~:) = r. pr~p~2,(r{~} k) 
by lemma 2 
= j,j*pr~pr2,(F{~} ~') 
by (3.7). 
Hence : 
pr l ,Cal , a2

prl,Wl,a2 =

9 
7 3 pr2pr2*3*7*c~ = f*f, ck 
follow, since f = pr2 o j o 7. 
To summarize, since u~ ~ = al + a2, we have obtained :

c~:f*f,V + f*f,c~, 
prl,COl,tY2 = 
Triple formula 
(3.14) 
c) Let us consider the other terms of the sum (3.12) : 
We wrote above u~ = ~i=0 v~ h with (for h > 1) v~ h = (--2)hwh, where 
Wh = W'll*r' ~-2*F- ~3"{~} k-h. ((Bq*F h-l) â€¢ W) . 
A 
Let b : B ~ 
H2(V) â€¢ V be the canonical imbedding ; then Bq*F h-1 can be rewritten 
as b.b*q*F h-1 from (FP). Since on B, the restrictions Wll, w21 and w31 are equal, one 
can rewrite Wh as : 
Wh = Wll*r " wl*V . Wl*{~} k-h. (b,b* q'F h-1 â€¢ W) . 
It follows that in CH'(V x W) :

One can rewrite u~ I as :

b) Let us consider the first term of the sum (3.17) :

~2 
Notice first (see notation 17) that 
ready noticed (lemma 4.(ii)) that 
has codim(G,3 x W) = n, it follows 
q*6,s(F) = 6~,(s(F) x V). 
Also we have al-

U2=lGi3 , 
Since in H2(~-~) x V x W one 
that :

From (FP), one has 5~,(s(F) x V) . Gi3 = 5',((s(F) x V) . 51"Gi3). The computation 
performed in chapter 4 yields 
51*Gia=B 
for 
i=1,2. 
(3.18) 
Hence : 
{q*~,,(F) x cwy". (O â€¢ w) = 2{(6',(,(F) â€¢ V). B) x cwy '+" . 
It follows that : 
u~ I~ = 2~*F. s 
k. {(6',(s(F) x V). B) x cW} "+" . 
(3.19) 
As we have seen previously, on B, the restrictions Wll, w21 and w31 are equal. Therefore, 
one has : 
.;10 = 2~*r. ~1"{~} ~ 9 {(~:(s(F) â€¢ V). B) â€¢ cW) m+" . 
Therefore, since codim(~) = -2n and m - n = k, (FP) and (7"42) yield: 
~,4 '~ = 2r. {~}~. {~1,(~',((4F) â€¢ v). B)) â€¢ cW} ~ . 
Let us consider the commutative diagram

where ql is the first projection (restriction of' q) and p is the restriction of 7rl

p,ql,(q~s(F).B)=p,(s(F).ql,B), 
by(FP) 
= 
p,(s(F). 1), 
because B is a graph of F in V 
= 
c(V) -1, 
because F can be identified with the exceptional 
divisor of V'~V. 
Finally, since ~ = c(V) -1 X cW, we are left with : 
~l,V~ '~ = 2F. (~}k. {~}k = 2j,/,({~}k)2

In view of (2.8), we have thus proved the result :

(3.20) 
c) Let us look at the other terms of the sum (3.17) : 
Recall that v~

where, for h > 1, one has 
u; 'h = (--2)h~'i*r 9 {q*5,s(F) x cW}". ~3"{~} k-h. (Bq'F h-1 x W) . 
But, as already seen in b), the restrictions w11/3 and 0331B are equal. One can therefore 
substitute w3* by &'i* in the above equation. Furthermore, since codim(Bq*F h-1 x 
W) = n + h, one has from (7~1) : 
{q*5,s(F) x cW}". (Bq*F h-1 x W) 
= 
{(q*5,s(F). Bq*F h-l) x cW} "+'+h

Hence :

Since codim(w'i) = -2n and k = m - n, we obtain from (FP) and (T42) the equality 
in CH'(V x W) :

since

We had from (3.6)

prl,Wl,U 
and also, v --/21 
-/]2 
: 
/'IX -- (D'~ -- /]~/) according 
to notation 13 and 15. Hence we have the equality 
m3 = prl,wl,ul - prl,oal,U2 + 
prl,Wl,U~'. Then, according to (3.8), (3.15) and (3.23), one has the equality: 
k 
m-'~ = m2f*f,V - c,,f*f,V - f*f, ck q- 2c~. -I- ~ 2hc,:-hC,,+h 
(3.24) 
h=l 
Using the known expression for m2 (see theorem 2), one can give for ~33 the more 
familiar expression (cf. Kleiman [KL1], th. 5.9) : 
k 
m"~ = f*f, m2 -- 2ckrn2 + ~ 2hc~-hCk+h 
h=l 
To conclude, one has shown the following theorem : 
Theorem 4 Let f : V ----+ W be an arbitrary morphism of proper, smooth varieties 
with dimW 
= 
k+dimV and 0 < k <dimV /2. Let ~33 E CH2k(V) be the "triple 
class", direct image of the cycle 
A 
A 
A 
M3 = [g3(r)]. [H3(V) â€¢ W] 
e 
CI-F(H3(V 
â€¢ W)) 
where F is the graph of f . 
Then one has the 'triple formula" 
k 
m"--~ = f* f, m2 - 2ckm2 + ~ 2hCk-hCt:+h 
(3.25) 
h=l 
where c~ is the i th Chern class of the virtual normal bundle f*TW - TV and where 
m2 denotes the double class in CI-I~(V). 
Remark 5 : In chapter 5, we will explain (in a particular case) how to interpret the 
existence of excess components in the cycle/I//3 in the case where the morphism f has 
Sz-singularities. 
For example, let f : p2 
> F 3 be defined by f[x : y : t] = [x 2 : zy : yZ : t2]. Let H 
(resp. h) be the hyperplane generator of CHI(~ 3) (resp. CHX(pZ)). Then f(p2) is a 
quadratic cone C and f,[p2] = 2[C] = 4H. One has: 
f*H = 2h 
and 
c(/*TF 3 - T? 2) = f*(1 + H) 4. (1 + h) -3 = 1 + 5h + 6h 6 
The equality m2 = 3h follows (note that the double locus of f is degenerate here). 
Moreover, f.h = 2H 2 and therefore (theorem 4) one has ~33 = 6h 2, hence deg(~33) = 6. 
Here, the intersection is reduced to the only extra component 1 (defined in chapter 5, 
page 55), as is easily seen. This example is confirmed by theorem 5.

Chapter 4 
Intermediate computations 
This chapter provides details of the computations used previously. 
4.1 
Let X be a non-singular variety of dimension p and do C X a doublet of support a 
point 0 E X. One can choose local coordinates (x, Y2, Y3,- .., Yv) centered at 0 such 
that the ideal of do in Ox is (x 2, Y2, Y3,..., Yv)" A chart of H2(X) = Hilb2(X) at do is 
then given (see [Ill) by (a, b, c2, d2,..., c v, dr), i.e. the coefficients of the neighbouring 
ideal in Ox : 
(x 2 + ax + b, -Y2 + c2x + d2 , -Y3 + c3x + d3 , . . . , -yp + Q,X + dr) 
(The minus signs are used to simplify the computations). Notice that in this chart, 
the hypersurface D C H2(X) consisting of doublets of support a single point is given 
by the equation a 2 - 4b = 0. 
Notation 18 : One will write ~ = (Y2,.--, Yl,), g = (c2,..., %) and d = (d2,..., dr), 
so that the ideal of do C Ox is (x 2, if) and the ideal of a neighbouring doublet is 
(x 2 + az + b, -~ + x~ + d~ 
So a chart of H2(X) at do is given by : 
(a, b, e, d3 
(4.1) 
4.2 
Flatness of 7rl and 7r2 
Let do C X be again a doublet of support 0 and let us consider Hz(X) C H2(X) â€¢ X, 
the tautological cover of H2(X). We want to give a chart of it at do = (do, 0). 

Proof of lemma 4.(iv) and of ~IlH : 0 
45 
Let ((,V2,... ,%) be the coordinates of a point Pl E X in the neighborhood of 0. 
Using the previous notation, one denotes again its coordinates by (~, ~). One expresses 
H2(~'X) in the chart (a, b, ~, d~(~, ~) of H2(X) â€¢ X by requiring all coordinates of Pl 
to verify the equations defining the doublet, i.e. : 
~ + a~ + b 
0 
(4.2) 
-~+@'+ 
(/ = 
0 
(4.3) 
One sees that H2(~-X) can be expressed locally as a graph (~,~,a,~ ~ (b,d-~. And 
therefore 
(~, if, a, ~ 
(4.4) 
constitutes a chart of H2(X) at (d0, 0). 
A 
Let us then express the morphisms 7q : H2(X) ~ 
X and ~2 : H2(X) ~ 
X. 
For ~1, it is easy, since d = (d, pl) must be sent to Pl. This gives : 
For lr2, one must find the coordinates of P2 = Res(pl, d). The abscissa of P2 is the 
other root ofx 2+ax+b,i.e. 
-a-~. 
Asp2 is located on the line defined by the 
equations ~ = xS"+ ~ its ordinate is -(a + ~)~'+ d= 77- (a + 2~)~', in view of (4.3). 
Hence : 
~1 : (~,~,a,~ 
~+ (~,~) 
(4.5) 
7r2 : (~,ff, a, 4 
~ 
(-a-~,~-(a+2~)c~ 
(4.6) 
These expressions show that ~h and 7r2 are submersions~ and therefore flat 
morphisms. 
The divisor F C H2(X) corresponding to the non simple doublets, i.e. px = p2, is 
then given by the equations : 
= --a--~ 
which reduce to 
and 
~ = ~- (a + 2~)~ 
a + 2~ = o. 
(4.7) 
4.3 
Proof 
of lemma 
4.(iv) and of ~1H : 0 
How can the two-sheeted covering 0 : H2(X) 
> H2(X), which is nothing else 
that the restriction to H2(t-X} of the natural projection H2(X) â€¢ X 
~ H2(X), be 
expressed? 
From equations (4.2) and (4.3), one has in the charts (4.4) and (4.1) : 
0 : (~, ~, a, c~ ~-+ (a, b = _~2 _ a~, 5", d= 
~- 
~c~ . 
(4.8) 

46 
Intermediate computations 
Notice in particular that if the ideal (a 2 - 4b) of D is lifted by 0, one finds the ideal 
A 
(a + 2~) z, which is the square of the ideal of F C He(X). Therefore, we have proved 
the statement (iv) of lemma 4 : 
O*[D]=2[F] 
in 
CHI(H2(---~)). 
(4.9) 
The Jacobian DO of 0 (in the charts (4.4) and (4.1))is:

where I denotes the identity matrix. DO is invertible except if 2~ + a = 0, which 
is the equation of F ; therefore we have proved (1.1) (see chapter 1). Moreover, the 
restriction of 0 to F is not ramified, since in the local coordinates (~, ~, ~ of F, 0 is 
given by : 
(~, ~, c-) ~ (-2~, ~2, ~, ~_ ~ 
This shows that : 
~FiH1 
~- 0 , 
which is used in the demonstration of lemma 5. 
(4.10) 
4.4 
Proof 
of lemma 
4.(iii) 
Let us now prove some other statements of lemma 4 (by denoting again the variety 
by X and not by V). Let (~', 3) be the coordinates of a point P3 E X. 
A 
In H2(X) x X, (4.4) provides a chart 
(~, ~, a, c~(~', 3) 
(4.11) 
A 
In this chart, the graph G13 of 71" 1 : H2(X) 
~ 
X is given by the condition P3 = Pl, 
i.e. : 
~'--~ 
and 
3=~. 
In the same chart, the graph G23 of ~r2 (condition P3 = P2) is given by (see (4.6)) : 
Consequently, one has the ideals : 
I(G13) -- (~' - ~, 3 - ~) 
and 
and 
3 = 77- (a + 2~)~'. 
z(a23) = (~' + a + ~, 3 - ~+ (a + 2~)c-). 
(4.12) 
Therefore, the ideal of the scheme-theoretic intersection G13 N G23 is : 
(~'-~,3-~,~'+a+~,3-~+(a+20c-), 

Proof of lemma 4.(ii) and (v) 
47 
or ({' -- ~, @ - r~, a + 2~). This ideal corresponds to a non-singular subvariety of 
H2(X) x X. Of course, it is the same ideal as the ideal of the graph B of rq from F 
to X, since B C Gla N G2a and B is non-singular. This proves the statement (iii) of 
lemma 4 : 
B = Gla Cl G2a 9 
(4.13) 
4.5 
Proof 
of lemma 
4.(ii) and 
(v) 
Notice that the expression (4.8) locally gives 
o'=e x idx : 
H2(X) x X --+ H2(X) x X 
(~,~, a,c-)(~',(~) ~ 
(a, b=-~2-a~,g, 
i=~-~c-)(~',~) 
(4.14) 
a) Let us look for the inverse image 
0 = O'-'(U) in H2(-'--X) â€¢ X. 
In the chart 
(a, b, < c0({', ~) of H2(X) â€¢ X, the subvariety U is given by the ideal (~,2 + a{' + 
b, -rf + ~'~*+ c/), which can be obtained by replacing the coordinates ({, if) by ({', r~) 
in (4.2) and (4.3). By lifting it by 0', one finds the ideal of U : 
((~' - ~)(~' + ~ + a), q- ? + (( - {)~. 
Introduce the new coordinates A" = ~' - {, A = {' + ~ + a, 37 = ~ - r~, keeping the 
other three {, ~" and ft. Therefore, the ideal of 0 is 
i(0) : (xA, -Y + Xc-) 
Also (see (4.12)), the ideal of G13 U G23 in these new coordinates is : 
:(0,3 u c~) 
(x, Y) n (x, Y + (.A - x)~. 
One does have I(U-) = I(Gla U G23), since the inclusion C is obvious and the other 
one comes from the following computation : if aX + ft. y = 7A + ~" (2~ + (A - X)c-), 
where "." is the dot product, it follows that 7A + A6"- 5 E (X, 2)7). 
Then 3',4 + A6'. ~' = AX + ft. 3~ and therefore /~ (and fi) is a multiple of A, by 
factoriality. Hence the condition 7,,4 + A6. ~ E (X,A, -y + Xc-'). Therefore, we have 
proved the equality of the schemes : 
0 = G13 O G2a 9 
(4.15) 
b) Let us look for the inverse image 0'*[R] where R C U C H2(X) x X has been 
defined above (notation 12). First, one has the equations of U : 
~,2+a~,+b=O 
and 
-rf+~'~'+c~=O. 

48 
Intermediate computations 
Furthermore, one has the equation of R itself, similar to (4.7) : a + 2~' = 0. Thus the 
ideal of R is (~,2 + a~' + b, -r~ + ~'~'+ ~ a + 2~'). By lifting it by 0', one finds the 
ideal in H2(-~) â€¢ X: ((~' - ~)(~' + ~ -b a), ~- r? -t- (~1 _ ~)~., a + 2~'). 
Let us perform the same change of variables X = ~' - ~, A = ~' + ~ + a, y = ~ - rT, 
and keep ~, ~'and fT. In these new coordinates, the ideal of O'-I(R) is 
z = (x.4, -Y + 
A + x). 
On the other hand, the ideal of B = G13 N G23 is, as was seen in w 4.4 : 
J= (~'-~, @-~, a+2~) = (X,y,A-X) 
= (X,y,,A) . 
In the new coordinates (A, 6', ~, ~y, X, ~), let M be the subvariety of ideal K = (6", ~, r~). 
Then one sees that J+K is the ideal of the origin, while I+K = (XA, ~, 2(+,.4, ~, ~, ~) 
is the ideal of a double point. It follows that : 
O'*[R] = 2[/5']. 
(4.16) 
4.6 
Proof of lemma 1 
Now, we consider the situation of w 2.1, i.e. X is a subvariety of the non-singular 
variety Z. Let II1 and II2 : H2(Z) ~ 
Z be the two natural morphisms. If F C 
H2(Z) is the divisor of the non simple doublets, one writes : 
'~) = F ['l YIll(X) 
= f ~ [I21(2) 
. 
Let us show that this intersection is transverse. 
Let do be a doublet of D. 
We consider the most degenerate case : the case 
with the scheme theoretic inclusion of do in X. If p = dim X and q = dim Z, let 
(x, Y2,..., Yp, Y~+I,..., Y'q) be coordinates of Z (centered at 0 = supp(do)), in which the 
equations of X are Y~,+I ..... 
ylq = 0 and the ideal of d0 is (x e, Ye,..., Yp, Y~+I,-.-, Y'q)- 
We use a shortened notation, as in notation 18 : 
(x, ~7, ~) 
chart of Z 
where the ideal of do is I0 = (z 2, g, ~). 
Let us use again the notation of w 4.2 and generalize it. As for (4.1), a chart of 
He(Z) at do is : 
(a, b, ~', ~ c ~, c~) 
where 
~', c~e C p-1 
and 
c ~, ~ ff C q-p 
(4.17) 
correspond to the neighbouring ideal 
I = (x e + ax + b, -~+ x~+ ~ -g + xd + ~) . 

Flatness of P12 and of P3 
49 
Let ([, ~, ~) be the coordinates of a point of Z in the neighorhood of 0. Then one has 
the equations of H2(Z) in H2(Z) x Z: 
{ ~2+a~+b=0 
-77+ @'+ d= 0 
(4.18) 
-~ + ~ + d~ = 0, 
giving locally H2(----Z) as a graph (~, ~, ~, a, ~', d) ~-~ (b, ~ ~). And therefore: 
(~, ~, 775, a, ~', d) 
(4.19) 
constitutes a chart of H2(Z) at (d0,0). The morphism 
I]2 : H2(Z) 
~ 
Z can be 
expressed as (of. (4.6)): 
(~, ~,r? ~, a, ~', c ~) w+ (-a-~,g-(a+2~)~',~-(a+2()d) 
. 
Using the same argument as in w 4.2, one sees that in the chart (4.19), F is given 
by the equation a + 2~ = 0 ; while II~I(x) can be expressed by @ - (a + 2~)c ~ = 0. 
Therefore, the intersection 7) = F Yl II(I(x) C H2(Z) is transverse, 
(4.20) 
which proves lemma 1, page 14. 
4.7 
Flatness of P12 and of P3 
From now on, we concentrate on the variety H3(X) where X is non-singular (see 
w 3.1). It consists of the elements [ = (t, d12, d23, d31, Pl,P2, P3). Let 
P12: H3(X) 
~ 
H2(X) 
and P3: H3(X) 
~ 
X 
be the natural morphisms, where dl: = (PI, d12). We show that they are flat. 
We are led to consider the neighborhood of the most degenerate case, i.e. 
~=(to, do, do, do, O,O,O) 
where to is an amorphous triplet. Recall the following definition (already given in the 
introduction - see 0.7-) : 
A triplet t C X is said to be amorphous if supp(t) is reduced to only one point p 
and if the ideal oft is the square of the ideal of p in a germ of a smooth surface going 
through p. 
(The other triple points are curvilinear, i.e. subschemes of a non-singular curve). 
Consequently, in a chart (x, y, Y') of X (where ~" C G ~'-2 if p =dim X), the ideal of the 

50 
Intermediate computations 
triplet to is (x 2, xy, y2, E) and the ideal of the doublet do is (x 2, y, Z). From ([LB1], p. 
937), a chart of H3(t--X) at to is 
C It , 
(s, t, ~', c, c', 
v, fi, g). 
(4.21) 
Notice that in [LB1] it was assumed that p = dimX = 3, but the generalization can 
be easily performed. 
However, a chart of H2(X) at do is (a, b, c, d, ~', fi), which corresponds to the ideal 
(x 2 + ax + b, -y + cx + d, -Z + gx + f). (It is similar to notation 18, except that not 
only x but both x and y are needed in the calculation ; this is why E is introduced 
and not ~7). 
A 
Let (~,r/, 0 be the coordinates of a point close to 0 ; thus a chart of H2(X) 
at 
do -- (do,0) is : 
(~, r/, (, a, c, ~ 
, 
(4.22) 
A 
which comes from the equations of H2(X) in H2(X) x X: 
~+a~+b=o, 
-~+c~+d=0, 
-(+#~+/= 
o 
which state that the point must be on the doublet. (The calculation is exactly the 
same as for (4.2), (4.3) and (4.4)). 
Then one gives the local expression of P12. First, Pl is the point of coordinates 
(s, t, ~'). From [LB1], pp 934 and 937, one also has: 
a=--2s--s'=--2s+d'v 
= --y-- ~c. 
The local expression of P12 in the charts (4.21) and (4.22) follows : 
i - (s, t, ~, c, c', c", ~, ~, ~) ~ ~ 
= (s, t, ,~ -2s + c'% c, -~- 
~c) 
which proves, in the neighborhood of to : 
the flatness of P12- 
(4.23) 
Notice once more that we studied P12 in the neighborhood of the most degenerate 
case ; in the other cases, the computations are similar. 
The expression for P12 which was obtained previously enables us to show that : 
P~I(F) = El2 + E" C H-5~) 
(scheme theoretically) 
(4.24) 
Indeed, the divisor F C H2(X) of the non simple doublets is given locally in the chart 
(4.22) by a + 24 = 0 (same calculation as for (4.7)). If this equation is lifted by P12, 
one finds -2s + c'v + 2s = 0, i.e. d'v = 0. From ([LB1], p. 940), it is indeed the 
equation of E12 + E'. 

Proof of lemma 4.(i) 
51 
For P3, it is in fact a submersion, since the coordinates of the point P3 are : 
(s+s' +s", t+t'+t", g+#+r 7') 
(see [LB1], p. 935). Then one sees (again from [LB1], (1), (2), (13), (14) and (E)), 
that P3 = (s+...,t 
+... ,F+...), where the dots denote terms of degree > 2 in the 
coefficients of the chart (4.21). 
This proves the flatness of P3. 
(4.25) 
4.8 
Proof 
of lemma 
4.(i) 
A 
A 
Now, let r -- P12 x P3 : H3(X) --+ H2(X) x X be the morphism defined by 
r 
-- (~12,p3) and let 0 c H2(I"X) x X be the inverse image of the tautological 
scheme U C H2(X) â€¢ X by O' = 0 x idx (see notation 12). We are going to show 
that scheme-the0retically, r 
__ ~ = El3 + E23 + E*. Once again, we just study 
the neighborhood of the most degenerate case : t~ = (to, do, do, do, 0, 0, 0), with to 
amorphous (cf. definition 2). 
One uses again the previous notation : (a, b, c, d, g, f) is a chart of H2(X) at do ; 
let (~', ~, ~) be the coordinates of a point of X close to 0, so that one has : 
(~', r]', ~) 
chart or X at 0. 
(4.26) 
The ideal of U in the corresponding chart of H2(X) â€¢ X is 
(~,2 + a~' + b, -~'+ c(+ d, -~ + ~'+ y) 
Moreover, the local expression of 0' = 0 x idx (similar to (4.14)) is 
(~, % (, a, c, ~(~', ~', ~) ~-+ (a, _~2 _ a~, c, ~7 - ~c, ~', (- ~'~)(~', ~7', ~) 9 
By lifting the ideal of V by 0', one finds (similarly to w 4.5) the ideal of U in H2(I-X) xX : 
((~' - ~)(~' + ~ + a), (~' - ~)c + ~ - 7', (~' - ~)~+ (- C) 
n 
The local expression of r 
: H3(X) 
~ H2(X) x X in the charts (4.21) and 
(4.22) x (4.26) 
r (s,t,~,c,c',c",v,f, 5) ~ (s,t,~,-2s+c"v,c,-fi-Sc)(s+s'+s",t+t'+t",~*+~+r; 0 
is now available (see w 4.7), where s', s", t', t", r-;, r '5 are given by ([LB1], relations (1), 
(2), (13), (14) and (E)) :

Then by lifting the ideal of 5 by r one finds the ideal of r 
C H~3(X) : 
((~' + ~")(J + J' + c%), (~' + ~")c - t' - t", (~' + ~")(~+ ~c) +; +/9, 
i.e., by using the relations (4.27) : 
((c' + c")c'vt (c' + ~")c'v, (c' + c")~'~3) = (r + c")c'~) .

From [LB 1], pp 939-940, one recognizes the equation of the divisor E = Ez8 + E23-t- E'. 
Hence : 
r 
= ~ 
C H~T'X) , 
(4.28) 
which is used in lemma 4. 
4.9 
Proof of lemma 3 
We now consider the situation of w 4.6 : the variety X is now a subvariety (of dimension 
p) of the non-singular variety Z (of dimension q). The two natural morphisms are 
denoted once again by P12 and P3 : 
P12 : H3(Z) ~ 
H2(Z) 
and 
P3 : Ha(Z) ~ 
Z. 
Then, let (x, y, 2", 2) be a chart of Z at a point, so that 
(4.29) 
z3 = 0 are equations of X in Z. 
Let t~ = (to, do, do, do, 0, 0, 0) be a complete triple in X, with to amorphous ; it 
is afortiori in Z. Let ~ = (do, 0) C H2(~-X). 
Similarly to (4.22), one obtains a chart of H3(~) at ~, simply by changing 2" into 
(2, z~), therefore by changing ~into (~', r-~), fiinto (~7,/) and 3 into (3, o7'). The chart 
of Ha(-~) at & follows: 
(,, t, ~, r ~, c, c', c", v, e, p~, 3, J'). 
(Warning : the variable r ~ has nothing to do with ~ used in the previous section !). 
A 
How is H3(X) expressed in this chart ? Simply by ~ = 0, tP = 0, o 7' = 0 and therefore : 
A 
H3(X) is a non-singular subvariety of Ha(z). 
(4.30) 

Transversality of/3 and E 
53 
[t remains to check that Pt~I(H2~-))intersects transversally the divisors E~3, E23 
and E" in Ha(Z). Of course, one uses the chart of H2(Z) at do, similar to (4.22) : 
(~, 71, ~, C', a, 0, ~, r 
. 
In this chart, H2(----X) is given by d = 0, e ~ = 0. 
Then one uses the local expression, similar to (4.23) of P12 : 
P~ : 
H~(z) 
~ 
H~(z) 
(~,t,r 
~, ~,J') 
~ 
(~,t,~',~,-2~ + c'%c,-~- 
~c,-7' - r 
Thus p121(H-5-~)) has for equations r ~ = 0 and r + ~3c = 0 in H~). 
One has: 
E13, E23 and E" are transverse at P121(H2(X)) in Ha(Z), 
(4.31) 
since their respective equations are d + c" = 0, c' = 0 and v = 0. 
4.10 
Transversality 
of/3 and 
a) Finally, let V and W be two non-singular varieties, of respective dimensions n and 
T/'t. 
Let F C H2(~-~xW) be the divisor of the non simple doublets. Let us prove that 
a*F = F â€¢ W, if a : H2('-~) â€¢ W ~-+ H2(V---xxW) is the imbedding onto the horizontal 
doublets (see w 2.2). 
Let w 9 W and do = (do,0) 9 H2(V), with do of support 0. 
Consider d'o = 
a(d~o, w). At (0, w), one has a chart of V â€¢ W: (x, ?7, ~) where (x, ~) is a chart of V at 
0 and ] is a chart of W at w, the ideal of do COv being (x 2, ~). In exactly the same 
way as in w 4.6, a chart of H~(V'-~xW) at d~ is (~, ~, 71-; , a, ~', c~), which corresponds 
to the doublets close to (do, w), of ideal 
(x ~ + ax + b, -g+ x~+ ~ -r + ~ + ~) 
In this chart, F is given, as usual, by a + 2~ = 0. However, d = 0 is the equation of 
a(H2(--~) â€¢ W), since it must correspond to the horizontal doublets, and then ~ is 
constant. This proves the statement : 
The intersection F A (H2(V) x W) is transverse in H2(V x W). 
(4.32) 
b) Now let p : H3(~-V) â€¢ W r 
H3(V-~x W) be the imbedding on the horizontal triplets. 
One would like to show that it is transverse to ~ = E13 + ~3 + E'. 
Once again, we study what happens close to the most degenerate case : to = 
(to, do, do, do, 0, 0, 0) where to is amorphous. Let w 9 W. Consider t~o =/3(~, w). At 

54 
Intermediate computations 
(0, w), one has a chart of V â€¢ W: (x, y, 5", z'), where (x, y, 5") is a chart of V at 0 and 
z ~ is a chart of W at w, the ideal of to being (x 2, xy, y2, Z) and the ideal of do being 
(x 2, y, z). 
Similarly to (4.21), one obtains a chart of H3(V--"-'~W) at t~: 
C tl 
(s, t, ~', r-;, c, c', 
v, fi, p-;, ~, a -~) . 
In this chart, H3(~-V) â€¢ W is expressed by ~ = 0 and o ~ = 0, since z-; must be constant. 
The equations of the divisors IE13, 43 and E" are respectively 
: c ~ + c" = 0, c ~ = 0 
and v = 0. It follows that 
A 
m 
/3 is transverse to E13, 43 and E" and then fl*E = E â€¢ W in H3(V) x W. 
(4.33) 

Chapter 5 
Application to the case where V is 
surface and W a volume 
a 
Let V be a surface and W be a volume (i.e. dimV = 2 and dimW = 3) and let 
f 
: V 
~ W be a morphism having a S2-singularity at the point 0 C V which 
means that in local coordinates, f is written as : 
f(x,y) ~- (ql(x,y) -~-''', q2(T,y) -~-''', q3(x,y)'~-''') 
where the qi are quadratic forms, the dots denoting terms of degree > 2. 
The intersection H3(F) n (H3(V) x w) in H3(V â€¢ W) then possesses an excess 
component I, which consists of the 
iF = (T, D12, D23, D31, Pl, P2, P3) 
with Pl -- P2 -- P3 -- 0. The ideal of T is A/t 2, where A4 is the ideal of 0 in (gv. On 
the other hand, D12, 023 and D31 are arbitrary and therefore set theoretically, one 
has a bijection : 
i 
_u, p1 â€¢ p:~ â€¢ p1 
(5.1) 
~ 
(o12, D23, O31) , 
by writing p1 for P(ToV), where P denotes the set of lines. 
In the following, we assume that I is reduced, which implies that (5.1) 
is an isomorphism. 
One has the commutative diagram where the arrows are 
canonical imbeddings (the dimensions are shown in parentheses) :

5.1 
Computation of cu(v) 
a) Let 0' = f(0) C W. First, I is contained inside H3(V) (identified with Ha(v) â€¢ 
{0'}) and even contained inside E', so that v can be decomposed in the canonical 
imbeddings : 
I ~ E" ~ H3(V) ~-~ H3(V) â€¢ W . 
Thus, in the Grothendieck group K(I) of the vector bundles, one has 
u(v) = u(I, E') + u(E', Ha(v))I, + trivial bundle. 
But E" is a fibration on V (by T ~-~ pl) and I is the fiber at 0. Thus, in fact, 
u(v) = u(E ~ Ha(V))EI + trivial bundle, 
which gives the total Chern class : 
c.(~) = c.( E', Ha(V) )li 
If i : E" ~-+ Ha(v) is the canonical imbedding, one has therefore 
ClZ/(E ~ H3(V)) = i*[E'] . 
(5.2) 
Hence cu(E ~ H3(V)) -- 1 + i*[E~ 
Abusing the notation, one has therefore: 
cu(v) : 1 + [E']I, 
(5.3) 
Thus, it remains to find [E~ 
in CHI(I).

Let 5 C I ~- F1 x I? 1 x ~1 be the "small" diagonal consisting of complete triples 
(02, D, D, D, 0, 0, 0) where 02 denotes (improperly) the triplet of ideal Ad 2. Obvi- 
ously, one has 5 _~ p1 
b) 
A 
Lemma 6 By identifying 5 with ~1, one has the equality C1/](~ , H3(V)) = 1. 
Proof : 
Let (x, y) be the coordinates of V centered at 0. If D is a doublet of support 0, one 
denotes by Axis(D) the line it defines in this coordinate system. One sees that 5 -~ p1 
is the glueing of two open sets U0 and U~ (each one is isomorphic to C), where : 
U0 corresponds to the doublets D of non vertical axis, 
U~ corresponds to the doublets D of non horizontal axis.

In [LB1], p. 937 was given a chart of H3(V) at To -- (02 , Do, Do, Do, 0,0, 0) where 
Do is the doublet of ideal (x 2, y). This chart is 
(s, t, c, c', c", v)

(iii) Finally v is a coefficient which arises in the ideal J of a triplet close to 02 : 
J = (z 2 + ux + vy + w, xy + u'x + v'y + w', y2 + u"x + v"y + w'') 
Then let D~ be the doublet of ideal (y2, x). If one considers the complete triple 
= (02, Doo, D~, D~, 0, 0, 0), one sees that a chart of H3(I--V) at ~ 
is given by 
(S, T, C, C', C", V) 
where 
(5.7) 
(i)' S = t, T = s are the coordinates of the point Pl in the chart (y, x) of V (and 
not (x,y)) ;

roles of x and y, as 
j = (y2 + v,,y + u,,x + w,,, yx + v~y + u,x + w,, x 2 + vy + ux + w) . 
The first generator of J should indeed be written as y2 + Uy + Vx + W. But, 
from [LB1], relations (E), p. 937, one has: 
= -ev(c + c')(c + c' + c") . 
(5.8) 
In the chart (5.6), 5 is given by the equations s = t = d = c" = v = 0, i.e. 5 is 
parameterized by the direction c of the line y = cx. On the other hand, in the chart 
(5.7), 5 is given by the equations S = T = C' = C" = V = 0. Thus, one obtains the 
normal bundle to 5 in H3(V) as the glueing of C* x C 5 and C* â€¢ C 5 by : 
(c, ds, dt, dc', dc", dv) ~ (C, dS, dT, dC', dC", dV) .

O 
c) The inclusions 6 C E ~ C H3(V) yield in the Grothendieck group K(5) : 
u(5, E ~ + u(E', H3(V))la = u(6, H3(V)) 
Considering the first Chern classes and taking into account the previous lemma , it 
follows that (from (5.2)) : 
deg ClU(5, E') + deg [E']la = 1 . 
Moreover, the inclusions 5 C [ C E" yield u(5, E') = u(6, I) + u(I,E')la. 
But 
u(g, I) ~- T5 | T5 (recall that 5 is the small diagonal of I -~ P: â€¢ ~: â€¢ p1). Also, as 
said already, u(I, E ~ is trivial since I is the fiber at 0 of E" --+ V. Since 6 -~ 1 ~:, it 
follows that: deg [E~ 
= 1 - deg c:u(5, E ~ = 1 - 4 = -3. But one has (see (5.5)) 
[E']Iâ€¢ = a(A + B + C). Also, one sees that [5] = AB + BC + CA in CH2(I). Indeed, 
one can see that 5 is the intersection of the two diagonals A:2 and A:3 in ~1 â€¢ ~: â€¢ p1, 
i.e. [5] = (A + t3)(t3 + C) = AB + BC + CA, from (5.4). It follows that, again from 
(5.4) : 
-3 = deg([E']la ) = deg(([E']lz)l~) = deg(a(A -4- B + C)(AB + BC + CA)) = 3a 
Thus, a = -1 and one has therefore proved the following lemma :

Computation 
of cu(w)l ~

let X be a smooth subvariety of a smooth variety Z and let

and 
P:2:

> 0 
where E = E23 + E31 + E ~ and u denotes the normal bundle. 
In order to show this proposition, we need an intermediate lemma. First, intro- 
duce the notation : 
Application to the case where V is a surface and W a volume 
Using the above notation, one has an exact sequence of vector bundles 
Notation 20 : If ~ is a smooth variety, its tangent bundle is denoted by T~. 
As H3(----X) C P~I(H-~)), 
the differential dP12 : THe) 
P{2TH2("~) gives by 
restriction a morphism

A "normM derivative" morphism of vector bundles

Similarly, the differential dP3 : TH3(Z)

tive" : 
d'P3 : u(Ha(X),H3(Z)) 
> P;u(X,Z) 
, 
since H3(X) C Pfl(X). 
b) Then, one has the following lemma : 
Lemma 8 With the above notation, 
(i) d~P12 is a su~ective morphism of vector bundles on H3(X) ; 
(ii) if K is its kernel, one has an isomorphism of vector bundles : 
d'P3[g : K 
~> P~u(X,Z) 
Proof: 
We first give local expressions of dvP12 . One can see easily that it is sufficient 
to consider the case where X is a surface and Z a volume. 
We only study the 
neighborhood of the most degenerate case, i.e. To C H3(X) is given by

where 0 is a point of X, Do is a doublet of support 0 and 02 denotes the triplet of 
ideal A42, if Ad is the ideal of 0 in Ox (i.e. To is amorphous, cf. definition 2). 
Let (x, y, z) be the coordinates of the variety Z centered at 0, the equation of X 
being z = 0, so that one takes the triplet 02 with ideal (x 2, xy, y2 z) and the doublet 
Do with ideal (x 2, y, z). A chart of H3(----Z) at ~ is given in [LB1], p. 937: 
(s, t, r, c, c', c", v, ;, ~). 
(5.10) 
A 
In this chart, the equations of Ha(X) are r = p = a = 0 so that a trivialisation of 
A 
A 
r,(Ha(X), Ha(Z)) in the neighborhood of To is given by: 
(s, t, c, c', c", v)(dr, dp, da) 
, 
(5.11) 
where dr (resp. dp, dcr) represents a tangent vector in the direction r (resp. p, or). 
Similarly, a chart of H2(Z) at Px2(T0) = Do is: 
(s, t, r, a, c, e) 
(5.12) 
It corresponds to a point Pl of coordinates (s, t, r) and a doublet D of ideal (x 2 + 
A 
ax + b, -y + cx -t- d, -z + ex + f) close to Do = (Do, Pl)- In this chart, H2(X) is 
given by r = e = 0, since z = 0 is the equation of X in Z. Therefore, a trivialisation 
of ~(H2(X), H2(Z)) in the neighborhood of Do is: 
(s, t, 6, c)(d~, de). 
(5.13) 
Now, in the charts (5.10) and (5.12), the morphism P12 is given by (see the two lines 
before (4.23)) : 
(s, t, ~, c, c', c", ~, ;, ~) ~ (s, t, r, -2s + c"~, c, -~ - ~c). 
Moreover (see [LB1], p. 937), one has the equality : e = -p-ac. The local expression 
of d" P12 
d" P12 : 
(s, t, c, e, c", ~)(d~, dp, d~) 
~ 
(~, t, c, c', c", ~)(d~, -ap - cd~) 
(5.14) 
follows. 
We have therefore proved that d~Pz2 is a su_~jection of vector bundles, i.e. 
(i) of 
lemma 8. 
Let us now express P3 and d~P3 . In the same chart (5.10) of H3(Z) at To, we have 
seen (cf. the lines above (4.25)) that P3 can be expressed by : 
P3(s,t,r,c,c',d',v,p,~) 
= (s+s'+s",t+t'+t",r+r'+r") 
= 
(s - v(c' + e,), t - v(ce'+ ce + c,2 + ee'), 
r + ~(r + c")(o + ~c + ~c')) 
, 

62 
Application to the case where V is a surface and W a volume 
from (4.27). The local expression of d"P3 
d"P3 : u(H3(X),H3(Z)) 
--+ p~u(X,Z) 
(s, t, c, d, c", v)(dr, dp, dcr) 
~ 
(s, t, c, c', c", v)(dr + v(c' + c")(dp+ (c + c')dcr)) 
(5.15) 
follows. Let us then restrict d~P3 to K = Ker(d'P12). Expression (5.14) yields : 
d~P3rK : (s, t, c, c', c", v)(O, -cda, dcr) ~ (s, t, c, c', c', v)(v(c' + c")c'&r) . 
But v(d + c")d = 0 is the local equation of E = E" + E31 + E23 (see (4.28)). Therefore 
one sees that d'P3rK is an isomorphism of vector bundles on Ha(X) : 
K 
oo(-E) 
, 
and this proves (ii) of lemma 8. 
(Of course, one should also construct the local 
expressions of d"P12 and d"P3 in the neighborhood of other points of H3(X) - we 
leave it to the reader). 
[] 
The last step consists in applying the trivial lemma : 
Lemma 9 Let Y 
be a variety, D a Cartier's divisor and E, El, E2 three vector 
bundles on Y. Let fl : E 
~ E1 and f2 : E ----+ E2 be two morphisms of bundles. 
Assume that : 
(i) f2 : E ---+ E2 is a su__~ective morphism of bundles, 
(ii) fliK~ri2 is an isomorphism from Ker f2 onto IEI, where I = Oy(-D). 
Then one has the exact sequence of bundles on Y : 
0 ----+ IE1 ~t4 E -~ 
E2 ----+ 0 
, 
where u = (fliK~I2) -1. 
We apply this lemma with fi = d"P3 and f2 = d'P12 9 One gets the desired 
sequence and proposition 2 is shown. 
Remark 6 : This kind of computations recovers in a simpler way the results of [LB2] 
or [LB3]. 
c) We can now compute explicitly cu(w)l I = cu(H3(~-T),H3(-~xW))jz 
when F C 
V â€¢ W is the graph of f : V ---+ W. Of course, we will apply the previous results 
withX=FandZ=VxW. 

Computation of the contribution of I 
63 
Let us now consider the sequence of morphisms (see the diagram at the beginning 
of chapter 5) : 
8' 
I 
r 
v â€¢ w 
w 
(5.16) 
where fit and j are canonical imbeddings and 1 < i < 3. The composition of the four 
morphisms is then constant. Moreover, the normal bundle N = u(r, V x W) can be 
identified with the bundle (of rank 3) j*pr~TW. Then 
l* 
* 
/3 piN= 
/ ..... 
3 Pi J pr2TW is trivial of rank 3, 
(5.17) 
/* 
* 
which one writes as fi P~ N = O a. 
From proposition 2, one has the exact sequence of vector bundles on Ha(r) : 
0 ----+ PjN| 
O(-E) 
---4 u(w) --4 PI*2u(H2(F), H2(V x W)) 
> 0 . 
(5.18) 
One has also the similar exact sequence on H2(F) (one can refer for example to [LB2] 
or ILB3]) : 
0 ---9 r;N | O(-F) ----4 u(HZ(F), g2(Y x W)) ~ 
7r~N ~ 
0 
(5.19) 
where 7rl, lr2 : H~(r) ~ 
r are the natural morphisms. Of course, one has 7rl o P12 = 
P1 and 7r2 o P12 = P2 ; moreover, P~I(F) = E12 + E" (see (4.24)). Thus, by lifting 
the previous exact sequence (5.19), one obtains the exact sequence of vector bundles 
A 
on H3(F) : 
0 ---4 P?N | 
(~(-J~12 
- 
ET*) 
) i~ 
H2(V x W)) ~ 
J;:2~N ~ 
0 
(5.20) 
A look at (5.18) and (5.20) enables us to give the total Chern class : 
cu(w) = c(P~ N | O(-E)) . c(P; N | O(-E~2 - E')) . c(P~N) . 
By applying fl'* to both members of this equality, one obtains from (5.17) 
: 
cu(w)l I = c(O a | J3'*O(--E)) . c(O a | J3'*O(-E12 - E')). 1, 
which can also be expressed by 
cu(w)l~ = 3'*((1 - E23 - 
E31 - E')3(1 - 
~12 - 
E') 
3) 
, 
(5.21) 
since E = E23 + Eal + E ~ 
5.3 
Computation 
of the contribution 
of I 
From what we have seen at the beginning of chapter 5, the contribution of I in the 
cycle [H3(F)] - [Ha(V) x W] is C3(b'(w)] I 
-
-
 
b'(V)). From (5.21) and (5.3), one knows 
the total Chern class 
c(u(w)l~ - u(v)) =/3'*((1 -/;23 - Eal - E')a(1 - 
El2 
- e') 3) 
(5.22) 
I+E" 

64 
Application to the case where V is a surface and W a volume 
A 
where ,~' : I ~-~ Ha(F) is the canonical imbedding. Moreover (lemma 7), one has 
/3'*E" = -(A + B + C) where A, B, C E CHI(I) -~ z 3 were defined in notation 19. 
A 
Furthermore, the divisors E12, E23, E31 of Ha(F) give, when restricted to I, the 
three diagonals of ~1 x F1 x pl respectively. E12 is for example defined as the set of 
= (T, D12, D23, D31, Pl, P2, P3) such that D23 = Dal. If one denotes by Aab, Abe., 
Aca the three diagonals of p1 â€¢ p1 â€¢ pl (defined by Aa~ = { (a, b, c) t a -- b}, etc...), 
one sees that ~'*E12 = Abe, since D23 = D31. 
Moreover, Abe = B+C in CH 1 (~1â€¢ plâ€¢ F1) and similarly, by circular permutation: 
r 
23 = /kac = A + C E CHI(~ '1 â€¢ F 1 X: P 1) 
fl'*E31 = A,tb = A + B E CH'(P 1 x ~1 x ~1) . 
Then one has the total Chern class in CH'(I) : 
(1 - A)3(1 + A) a 
- ,(v)) = 
- (X T-g 
Since A 2 = B 2 = C 2 = 0 and deg(ABC) = 1, it follows immediately that : 
deg c3(v(w)lI -/2(v)) = 6 
(5.23) 
Therefore, the following theorem has been proved : 
Theorem 5 Let f 
: V ~ 
W be a morphism of a smooth surface in a smooth 
volume. The rnorphism f is assumed to have a S2-singularity at the point 0 E V. Let 
F C V x W be the graph off.

Let I be the excess component, of dimension 3, of the inters ction H (F)gI(H (V) x 
W) consisting of the complete triples T = (02, D12, D23, D31, 0, 0, 0) where supp(Dij) = 
{0}. 
The component I is assumed to be reduced. Then, the contribution of I in the 
O-cycle 
A 
M3 = [H3(F)] " [H3(V) x W] 
is of degree 6. Therefore, the contribution of [ is 6 in the O-cycle m 
~-~ ff CH2(V). 


Part two 
Construction of a complete 
quadruples variety 
The present goal is to construct a "good" space of ordered quadruples of a variety V, in 
order to give a definition and a computation of the quadruple class m4 for an arbitrary 
morphism 
f 
: X ~ 
Y 
between non-singular varieties (with dim X < dim Y). 
H~a~ve(V ) of the 
We saw in the introduction (in 0.7) that a "naive" generalization

H,,a~,~.(V ) obtained in this way is 
construction of H3(V) is not sufficient : the variety

in fact reducible and singular. Therefore, we had to construct an intermediate variety 
B(V), which is the closure of the graph of the residual rational map (see definitions 3 
and 4) :

The following chapter is devoted to the study of this auxiliary variety B(V). The 
construction of our complete quadruples variety will be given in chapter 7. 

Chapter 6 
Construction of the variety B(V) 
6.1 
Statement of the theorem 
Theorem 6 Let V be a non-singular, irreducible variety of dimension 
over C . 
Let B(V) be the closure of the graph of the residual rational map

where I(V) C Hilb2(V) x Hilb4(V) is the incidence variety. 
The variety B(V) is irreducible and non-singular of dimension 4 9 dimV. 
dim V > 3 
The irreducibility of the variety B(V) will be established in w 6.3. The proof 
of the non-singularity of the variety B(V) will be the subject of w 6.4. 
One can 
go back to the case where V is a variety of dimension 3 in a systematic manner. 
When n = 
dim V _> 4, one just has to replace z by Zl,...,z,~-2 everywhere in the 
computations. 
In the following, V will be a non-singular variety of dimension 3. 
Let us give some definitions : 
6.2 
Definitions, drawing conventions 
Definitions 7 : Let q be a quadruplet of support a closed point p of V. According to 
the description of Briangon [B1], the different quadruplets supported by p are given 
by the different ideals of Ov (in an appropriate coordinate system (x, y, z) centered 
at p) :

Construction of the variety B(V)

This quadruplet is called a curvilinear quadruplet. 
(ii) I(q) = (x:, y2, z) 
This quadruple point is called a square quadruplet . 
(iii) I(q) = (x a, xy, y2, z) 
This quadruplet is said to be elongated. 
(iv) 1(q) = (x, v, z) 2 
This quadruple point is said to be spherical. 
Drawing conventions : 
One will use the following drawing conventions :

- The following symbol will be used to represent a square quadruplet :

- An elongated quadruple point will be represented by the following drawing :

Irreducibility 
and 
dimension 
of B(V) 
6.3.1 
General 
facts on Hilbert 
schemes 
: 
Here, we recall some generalities on Hilbert schemes : 

Irreducibility and dimension of B(V) 
69 
Property 1 : Universal property of the Hilbert scheme 
The Hilbert scheme Hilbd(V) comes equipped with a d-sheeted tautological cover- 
ing, denoted by 'Hilbd(V), and defined in the product V â€¢ Hilbd(V). w denotes the 
projection from 'Hilbd(V) C V â€¢ Hilbd(V) on Hilbd(V); the projection w (called 
universal family) is flat by definition. From a set-theoretic point of view, 'Hilbd(V) 
contains the couples (p, ~) such that the point p is a subscheme of ~. 
The Hilbert scheme Hilbd(V) is solution of the following universal problem : 
Let S be a scheme. Let y C S â€¢ V be a flat d-sheeted ramified cover of S (via 
the first projection). Giving such a subscheme y of S â€¢ V is equivalent to giving a 
unique morphism f : S ~ Hilbd(V). The family y is obtained by the pull-back of 
the universal family IHilbd(V) by f. 
One recalls the flatness criterion for a finite morphism : 
Let ~ : X --+ T be a finite morphism of schemes, with T integral. Then ~ is flat 
over T if and only if the length of the fibers ~-l(t) is a constant d independent of 
tET. 
Property 2 : Recall that if ~ E Hilbd(V) is a d-uple union of ~1 and ~2 where ~1 is a 
dl-uple of support Pl and ~2 is a (d-dl)-uple disjoint from p~, then Hilbd(V) is locally 
isomorphic at ~ to the product Hilb d' (V1) â€¢ HiIb d-d1 (V2), where V1 is a neighborhood 
of V at ~1 and V2 is a neighborhood of V at ~2- 
Improperly, we will say that the d-uple ~ is deforming to ~ in Hilbd(V) and we 
will denote this deformation by ~ -+ ~ when c goes to 0, if the family (~)~ec defined 
in this way corresponds to a sub-family of V â€¢ C, flat over C, via the second projection. 
Said differently, this deformation of base C corresponds to a unique morphism from C 
to Hilbd(V). 
6.3.2 
Recall that I(V) is the incidence subvariety of Hilb2(V) x Hilb4(V) consisting of 
the elements (d, q) such that d is a subscheme of q. Also recall that 1-Is denotes the 
projection from I(V) onto gilb4(y). One introduces some new notation: 
Notation 21 : From now on, one denotes by Hd(V) the Hilbert scheme 
Hilb'l(V) of the d-uples of V. 
Notation 22 : 
9 For d < 4, we denote by H~(V) the dense open subset IF] of Hd(v) containing 
the d-uples formed by d simple points. 

70 
Construction of the variety B(V) 
9 One denotes by I#(V) the open subset of I(V) containing the elements (d, q) 
such that q E HI(V ). 
9 One denotes by H3(V) the subvariety of H2(V) â€¢ H3(V) containing the (d, t) 
such that d is a subscheme of t. This subvariety is non-singular [ELB]. The 
second projection 
H (V) 
H (V) 
(d,t) 
t 
is generically a 3-sheeted covering. 
The Hilbert scheme H4(V) has a natural stratification consisting of five strata 
denoted by H4(V), H42(V), H41(V), H411(V) and H4111(V). 
- The stratum H4(V) is the closed subvariety of H4(V) containing quadruple points 
(i.e. the support is only one point). 
- The stratum H42(V) is the locally closed subvariety of H4(V) containing quadru- 
plets which are the union of two double points. 
- The stratum H~(V) is the locally closed subvariety of H4(V) containing quadru- 
plets which are the union of a triple point and a simple point. 
- The stratum H41 I(V) is the locally closed subvariety of H4(V) containing quadru- 
plets which are the union of a double point and two simple points. 
- The stratum H4111(V) is the open subset containing simple quadruplets, previ- 
ously denoted by H~(V). 
This natural stratification of H4(V) will induce through the projection II2 : I(V) --+ 
H 4 (V) a stratification on I(V), denoted by I.(V). Note that the open subset II111(V) 
of I(V) has already been denoted by I#(V). 
Other drawing conventions : 
- 
We recall the drawing convention used to represent the double point d of support a 
pointpofV : 
- We will represent a n-uple curvilinear point (i.e. a subscheme of a non-singular 
curve) by the symbol : 
- Then, for an amorphous triplet t (cf. definition 2), we will use the following con- 
vention : 

Irreducibility and dimension of B(V) 
Our goal now is to prove the following proposition : 
71 
Proposition 3 The incidence subvariety I(V) of H2(V) x H4(V) is irreducible of 
dimension 12 = 4. dim(V). 
Proof : 
We will show that the open subset I#(V) C [(V) is dense in I(V). According to 
property 2, it is enough to prove that each element (d, q) of the stratum /4(V) (i.e. 
when the support of the quadruplet q is one point) is the limit of elements of I#(V). 
In fact, when the support of the quadruplet contains at least two points, the result is 
already known, as shown below : 
a) In an element of the stratum/3I(V): 
With our drawing conventions, the elements of this stratum are of one of the four 
following forms : 
- The quadruplet q is the union of a triple point t and a simple point m, the 
doublet d is simple :

doublet d is contained in the triplet t :

Figure6.2: dCt andq=tUm 
From property 2, the Hilbert scheme H4(V) is locally isomorphic at q to the product 
H3(V) x V. If the doublet d is simple (figure 6.1), the variety I(V) is locally isomorphic 
to the product ~H3(V) â€¢ V which is an irreducible variety of dimension 12. If the 
doublet d is a double point (figure 6.2), the incidence variety is in this case locally

Construction of the variety B(V) 
isomorphic to the product H3(V) x V which is a variety of dimension 12. Moreover, 
each element of this stratum can be obtained as the limit of elements of the open 
subset Ir 
b) In an element of the stratum h2(V): 
The quadruplet q is the union of two double points dl and d2 of support Pl and P2 :

Figure 6.3: q=dl U d2 
Still from property 2, the Hilbert scheme H4(V) is locally isomorphic at q to the 
product H2(V) â€¢ H2(V). If d is the union of the two simple points Pl and P2, the 
incidence variety is locally isomorphic to the product 'H2(V) x 'H2(V). If d is one 
of the two doublets dl, d2, the variety I(V) is then locally isomorphic to the product 
H2(V) â€¢ H2(V). In these two cases, I(V) is a variety of dimension 12 and the elements 
of this stratum can be obtained again as the limits of elements of the open set Ir 
c) In an element of the stratum/211(V): 
The quadruplet q is the union of a double point dl of support Pl and two simple points 
P2 and P3 : 
dd~ 1 
9 P2 
9 P3 
Figure 6.4: q = da U P2 U P3 
If d = dl or d = P2 U P3, the incidence variety is in this case locally isomorphic to the 
product Hz(V) â€¢ H2(V) which is a variety of dimension 12. Now, if d is one of the 
two simple doublets Pt U P2, Pl U P3, the variety I(V) is then locally isomorphic to the 
product V x V x H2(V) which is of dimension 12. The points of this stratum belong 
to the closure of I#(V) in I(V). 
d) It remains to study the elements of the stratum I4(V) : 

Irreducibility and dimension of B(V) 
73 
Let us denote by p the support of an element (d, q) of I4(V). Remember that 172 
is the projection from I(V) onto H4(V). 
(i) If q is a curvilinear quadruple point, there is only one element (d, q) in the fiber 
II~-l(q), where d is the only doublet contained in q. In an appropriate local coordinate 
system (x, y, z) centered at p (cf. definition 7.(i)), the quadruplet q is defined by the 
ideal I(q) = (x 4, y, z) of Ov and the doublet d has for ideal I(d) = (x 2, y, z). 
Let us consider the ideal Ie = (x 4 - r 
y, z) ; it is the ideal of a quadruplet qe of 
H~(V). 
The ideal Je = ( x2 - r y, z) defines a doublet de of H~(V). 
Since the inclusion of 
ideals Ie C Je is eqnivalent to the scheme-theoretic inclusion de C qe, it follows that 
for every r different from zero, the element (de, qe) is in I#(V). In addition,/~ = I(qe) 
obviously goes to I(q) when r goes to 0. Similarly, Je = I(d~) goes to I(d) when r 
goes to 0. 
So, when the quadruplet q is curvilinear, the element (d, q) of I(V) is the limit of 
elements of Ir 
(ii) If q is square, from definition 7.(ii), one can assume it to be defined by the 
ideal I(q) = (x 2, y2 z) of Oy, where (z, y, z) is an appropriate local coordinate system 
centered at p. As the coordinates x and y play a symmetric role, one can always assume 
that a doublet d ~ which constitutes an element (d ~, q) of the fiber II~-l(q) is given by 
the ideal I(d '~) = (x 2, y - ax, z), where a is a fixed scalar. 
For a ~ 0, the ideal Ie = (x(x - r y(y - as), z) defines the quadruplet qe which 
is the union of the four following simple points : 
Pie

0 
P2~

a 
(The notation m 
b represents the coordinates in C 3 of the point m. The point m 
c 
is then defined by the ideal (x - a, y - b, z - c). ) 
Obviously, I(qe) goes to I(q) when c goes to 0. The ideal (x(x - e), y - ax, z) defines 
the doublet de which is the union of the two simple points Pie and P3e- The doublet de 
deforms in d ~ in H2(V) because I(de) goes to I(d '~) when r goes to 0. We represent 
these different configurations as follows :

If a = 0, the element (d ~ q) of I4(V) is the limit of elements (de, qe) of I#(V), 
where qe is the quadruplet union of the following four simple points : 
Ple 0 
e 
C 
0 
0 
P2e 0 
P3e C 
P4e 
0 
0

0 
The quadruplet qe is defined by the ideal [(q,) = (x(:c - e), Y(Y - r z) and it goes to 
I(q) when e goes to 0. If dE is the simple doublet Pie tO P2e, de is defined by the ideal 
I(d~) = (x(x - ~), y, z) which goes to I(d ~ when r goes to 0. Again, we represent 
these configurations as follows : 
Y 
P4e L p 3 e  
L

X 
i 
(d~ 
(de,qe) 
. 
X 
So, if q is a square quadruplet, each element (d, q) in I4(V) is the limit of elements 
of I#(V). 
(iii) Now, if the quadruplet q is elongated, from definition 7.(iii), one can assume 
q to be defined by the ideal I(q) = (x 3, xy, y2 z). A doublet d ~ which constitutes an 
element (d% q) of the fiber II~-l(q) is the same as the one given by an ideal I(d '~) = 
(x 2, y - ax, z).

the two simple points Pie and P3~, d~ is defined by [(d,) = (x(x - r y - ax, z). This

So, when the quadruplet q is elongated, every element (d, q) of I(V) belongs to Ir 
the closure of I#(V) in I(V). 
(iv) If the quadruplet q is spherical, that is to say defined by the ideal m 2 where mp 
is the maximal ideal of Or, the fiber H~-l(q) is isomorphic to P(TpV) (the projective 
space associated to the vector tangent space of V at p). As there is no preferred 
direction in such a quadruplet, it is sufficient to prove that one of the elements (d, q) 
of the fiber II~-l(q) is in the closure of I#(V) in order to obtain the result for all the 
elements of the fiber. 
For an appropriate local coordinate system (x, y, z) centered at p, the doublet d 
is defined by the ideal (x 2, y, z). The element (d, q) is the limit of elements (de, qE) of 
I#(V), where q~ is the simple quadruplet q~ = Pie Up2~ Up3e UP4E and de is the simple

The quadruplet qe is defined by the ideal I(qE) = (x(x-e), xy, xz, y(y-s), yz, z(z- 
e)), which goes to I(q) when e goes to 0. The doublet d~ of ideal [(de) = (x(x-e), y, z) 
goes to d in H2(V) when e goes to 0. 
So, when q is a spherical quadruplet, the element (d, q) of I(V) is in I#(V). 
We have therefore shown the inclusion of the stratum I4(V) in I#(V). As it is the 
same for the other strata, the equality I#(V) = I(V) follows. On the other hand, the 
open subset I#(V) is irreducible because there is a birational morphism from I(V) to 
the irreducible product H2(V) â€¢ H2(V) : 
l(V) ...-+ H2(V) â€¢ 
(d, q) 
... 
-~ 
(d, d' : q \ d) 
The incidence variety I(V) is therefore irreducible of dimension 12 = 2. dim (H2(V)). 
So, we have proved proposition 3.

Then proposition 4 follows trivially : 
Proposition 4 The closure B(V) of the graph of the residual rational map Res is an 
irreducible subvariety of I(V) â€¢ H2(V) of dimension 12. 

Non-singularity of the variety B(V) 
77 
Proof : 
Remember that U C I(V) is the open subset of I(V) where the rational residual 
map Res is regular. The graph Fn,~.w of Res restricted to U is isomorphic to U, which 
is a dense open set of dimension 12, from proposition 3. The closure B(V) of Fae,w 
in I(V) x H2(V) is then irreducible of dimension 12. 
[] 
6.4 
Non-singularity of B(V) 
Remember that II denotes the projection : 
n: 
R(v) 
~ H4(V) 
(d,q,d') 
~-~ 
q 
and ~r its restriction to B(V). Also remember that ~ denotes an element of the fiber 
~r-l(q) C B(V), (see w 0.7, definition 4 and notation 2). 
The study of the non- 
singularity of B(V) reduces to the cases where the support of the element ~ C B(V) 
consists of exactly one point. When the support of the quadruplet q consists of at 
least two points, the variety B(V) is in fact locally isomorphic at ~ to a smooth variety 
of dimension 12 = 4. dim (V) : 
- If the quadruplet q is the union of a triple point t of support p and a simple point 
m, according to property 2 the variety B(V) is locally isomorphic at ~ = t U m to the 
product H3(V) x V, where H3(V) denotes the incidence subvariety of H2(V) x H3(V) 
(cf. notation 22), 
- When the quadruplet q is the union of two double points dl and d2 of distinct 
supports, again from property 2, the variety B(V) is locally isomorphic at ~ = dl O d2 
to the product 'H2(V) x 'H2(V). 
In these two cases, the result is a smooth variety (of dimension 12) since it is 
locally the product of two smooth varieties. 
The goal of w 6.4.1 is to prove the non-singularity of B(V) at every element ~o, 
where qo is a locally complete intersection quadruple point (i.e. qo is curvilinear or 
square). Remember that the complete intersection k-uplets ~ are smooth points of the 
Hilbert scheme Hk:(V). It results from [HI-n-prop. 8.21.A(e). We will then prove in 
w 6.4.2 the non-singularity of B(V) at the points 4o where qo is a non-locally complete 
intersection quadruple point (i.e. qo elongated or spherical) . Remember [I2, F] that 
the Hilbert scheme H4(V) is irreducible and singular at the spherical quadruplets q, 
that is to say defined by the ideal Ad~2,, where M v is the ideal of a closed point p of 
V. (Also remember that we have assumed dim (V) = 3.) 
In this whole section, the support of the quadruple point qo is denoted by p. We 
denote by (x, V, z) an appropriate local coordinate system centered at p (cf. defini- 
tions 7), i.e. a system in which the quadruplet qo is defined by the ideal :

6.4.0 
Preliminaries 
a) In the following, we will divide elements of the algebra C{x,y, z} by ideals of 
C{x, y, z). In [B2], Brianqon gives a generalization of the division theorem of Weier- 
strass, according to the method of Hironaka (generalization in the sense that we 
divide a germ of an analytic function by several others, with respect to several coor- 
dinates). Let us now give some details on this division theorem. For each multi-index 
a -~ (al, a2, a3), the notation (xyz) '~ denotes the monomial x"ly~'2z '~3. Recall some 
definitions : 
Definitions 8 : 
9 A non zero linear form with positive integer coefficients is called direction L. For 
each element f in C{x, y, z}, let 
f = ~ 
a,. (xyz) (~ 
(xE~ 
9 The set 
N(f) = {a E 513 l a~ ~ O} 
is called Newton's diagram of f. 
9 The integer 
is called L-graduation of f. 
9 The element of C[x, y, z] : 
dL(f) = inf{L(a) l a,~ â€¢ O} 
inL(f) = 
~ 
a,~. (xyz) '~ 
L(,~)=dz(f) 
is called initial form of f with respect to the direction L. 
Such a positive linear form L defines an order on 1~ 3, denoted by < : 
(~ ---- (Or1, Or2, 0/3) < fl ~- (ill, f12,/33) 
if and only if : 
- either L(ax, a2, a3) < L(/3l, /32, /33), 

Non-singularity of the variety B(V) 
79 
- or L(al, a2, ha) = L(/31,/32,/3a) and there exists an index i0 such that a~ o </3,0 and 
for each index j > i0, aj =/3j. 
The linear form L then allows an ordering of the monomials of C{x, y, z}. 
Definition 9 : The smallest element of N(f) for this order is called a dominant 
exposant of f with respect to the direction L, and it is denoted by expL(f). 
For each ideal I and for each direction L, one can associate the set of the dominant 
exposants EL(I) of I and the set FL(I) = (a~, ..., %,) which is the minimal finite 
subset of N 3 such that EL(I) = LJl<i<_p(ai -4- N 3) 
(see [B1], [B2], [Gall). Let AL(I) = 
N 3 -- EL(I) ; there exists a unique basis {f,,} of I, called standard basis of I with 
respect to L indexed by FL(I), such that 
f (x, y, z) = ( yz) + 
e F (s) 
ileAL (I) 
Each element of C{x, y, z} is equivalent modulo I to a unique element of C{x, y, z} of 
the form : 
ai,(xYz) t~ 
flCAL(I) 
(see [B2], [Gal l, thm 1.2.5 p. 124). 
In particular, if I is of finite colength n, the family {(xyz)/~}/~CAL(S ) is a basis of the 
quotient C{x, y, z} over C and #AL(I) = n. 
I 
b) Moreover, we will frequently use the division theorem of Galligo by a family with 
parameters ([Gall, thin 1.2.7 p. 126) in the following particular case : 
Let I = (fl,..., fs,) be the ideal in C{x, y, z} of a n-uple point ~ of Ha(Y). The 
c{x, y, z} 
quotient (fl,..., fs,) is a C-vector space of dimension n. One assumes (fl,..., fp) to 
be the standard basis of I with respect a direction n ([B2], [Gall). The monomial 
c{x,y,z} 
x 
z '~ 
basis of (fT.. ::~,) is denoted by {( y ) }oe~.(s), where "-'' denotes the class of an 
element of C{x, y, z} modulo the ideal I. Let 
aCAL(I) 
ai.,,(xyz) <* 
One denotes by Os the C-algebra C{_a}. For each element f in Os{x, y, z}, one can 
perform the division of f by the family F1,..., F v and the remainder h is an element 
of the form : 
E 
'~EAL (I) 
where h<,(a) e Os. 

80 
Construction of the variety B(V) 
Definition 10 ([Gall, def. 1.4.5 p. 135) : Let ~ : X -+ S be a morphism of 
germs of analytic spaces. One denotes by 9)* : Os ~ Ox the corresponding local 
C-algebra morphism. 
There exists ([Gall, thm. 
1.4.4 p. 
135) a unique C-algebra Or, which is the 
quotient of Os, equipped with a canonical surjeetion X) : Os --4 Or, satisfying the 
conditions : 
(i) Ox| 
is a flat Or-module, 
(i/) For each morphism of algebras A* : Os --+ OT such that Ox| 
is a 
fiat OT-module, there exists one and only one morphism #* : Op --+ OT such that 
A* =if*ok:},. 
One calls flattener of the morphism ~o, the morphism ~op : Xâ€¢ 
--+ P obtained by 
the change of basis P ~-+ S. 
Property 3 : One denotes by (A', 0) the germ of an analytic subspace of (C a â€¢ Cap, 0) 
defined by Fl(x,y,z,a) ..... 
Fv(x,y,z,a ) = 0. 
The natural projection from 
V((F1,..., Fv) ) C (C a â€¢ C"v, 0) onto (S, 0) = (C '*', 0) will be denoted by 13. The Hilbert 
scheme Hn(V) is locally isomorphic at { to the flattener of II (see [Gr], prop. 0.4 
p. 20). One denotes by (P, 0) the basis of this flattener and Or the corresponding 
local algebra. (Op is a quotient of Os.) 
One recalls the flatness and division theorem of Galligo ([Gall, thm 1.2.8 p. 126) 
which will enable us to compute explicitly local flatteners. One has the equivalent 
statements : 
1. The module Os{x,y,z} is Os-flat, 
(F1,... ,Fp) 
2. For each f in Os{x,y,z}, the remainder of the division of f by the ideal 
(F1,..., Fv) is zero if and only if f C (&,..., &). 
Remark 7 : If I = I(4) is a complete intersection ideal, the morphism II introduced 
previously is fiat. Then one has (P, 0) = (S, 0) - the Hilbert scheme H"(V) is smooth 
at 4, of dimension 3n. 
In the following, we will use the result : 
Result 1 : According to the previous property, the Hilbert scheme Hn(V) is locally 
isomorphic at ~ to the flattener of basis P.

C{Xl,..., x,,}. In this case, let Yl = fi(Xl,..., x,,) ; the subvariety of C' x C ~ defined

point 
Recall that the rational application residual Res: I(V)... -4 H2(V) maps (d, q) on 
to d' = q \ d and that B(V) denotes the closure of its graph. Recall also that the 
projection from B(V) onto H4(V) is denoted by 7c.

Construction of the variety B(V) 
The case of the curvilinear quadruple point 
We intend to prove the following proposition : 
Proposition 5 The variety B(V) 
is smooth at ~o where qo E H4(V) is a curvilinear 
quadruple point. 
Proof : 
We are going to provide a chart of I(V) in the neighborhood of (do, qo) and to 
express the residual map Res in these coordinates. 
The curvilinear quadruplet qo of support p is defined by the ideal I(qo) = (x 4, y, z) 
of Ov. A quadruplet q close to qo in H4(V) is given by the ideal 
I(q) 
= 
(x 4 + aim 3 + a2x 2 + a3x + a4, 
y + a5 x3 -~- a6 x2 ~ aTx -4- a8, 
Z -t- a9 x3 + al0 x2 4- all x ~- a12) 
, 
so that a = (ax,..., a12) constitutes a chart of H4(V) at qo. 
Such a curvilinear quadruple point, i.e. subscheme of a non-singular curve C, can 
contain only one doublet : it is the doublet with the same support the point p, 
subscheme of C. Therefore, the doublet do is defined by the ideal (x 2, y, z). A doublet 
d in a neighborhood of do in H2(V) is given by the ideal 
I(d) = (z 2+ax+b,-y+cx+d,-z+ex+f) 
, 
so that A = (a, b, e, d, e, f) constitutes a chart of H2(V) at do. (The minus signs are 
just for convenience.) 
The inclusion of schemes d C q in the neighborhood of (do, qo) is equivalent to 
the inclusion of ideals I(q) C I(d) of C{a, Jt}{x, y, z}, which can be formulated by 
equations in C{_a,.A} that we are going to determine. For each of the three generators 
of the ideal I(q), the division by the ideal I(d) is performed. The remainder of the 
division of the i th generator of I(q) is denoted by r~. According to result [TCesl], 
w 6.4.0, the remainders ri are of the form : 
r~ ~ T~, 0 ~- ri,lz 
where rl,0 and ri.~ are elements of C{_a, __A}. 
From [7r 
again, the ideal I(q) is contained in the ideal I(d) if and only if the three 
remainders rm, r2, r3 are identically zero, which can be expressed by the six equations 
in C[a,A] : 
ala 2 - alb - a2a + a 3 - a 3 ~- 2ab = 0 
alab - a2b + a4 - a2b Jr b 2 = 0 
asa 2 - asb- a~a + aT + c = 0 
asab - a6b + as + d = O 
a9 a2 - a9b - aloa + an + e = 0 
a9ab - alob + a12 + f = 0

Non-singularity of the variety B(V)

These six equations form the generators of the ideal of c{a,A} which defines I(Y) 
in Hz(V) x H4(V) locally at (do, qo). From these six equations, one can see that the 
variety I(V) is obtained locally as the graph of a morphism : 
C 12 
-_~ 
C 6 
C_ = (al, a2, as, a6, a9, alo, a, b, c, d, e, f) 
~ 
(a3, a4, aT, a8, an, a12) 
So __C forms local coordinates of I(V) at (do, qo). 
Let us see now how the residual map Res can be expressed in these coor- 
dinates. 
As the quadruplet qo contains only one doublet, the residual doublet d'o = qo \ do is 
defined by the ideal I(d'o) = (x 2, y, z) of Or. A doublet d' close to d'o in H2(V) is 
given by the ideal 
I(d') = (x 2 + a'x + b',-y + c'x + d',-z + e'x + f') 
Thus, the parameters .4-- = (a', b', c', d', e', f') form a chart of H2(V) at d'o. The 
scheme-theoretic inclusion d' C q of the residual doublet is equivalent to the inclusion 
of ideals I(q) C [(d') and it is expressed by the six equations (6.1)'-(6.6)' of C[a,.A ~] 
(where a,..., f have been replaced by a',..., f' in the equations (6.1)-(6.6)). 
From (6.3)' and the expression of a7 (given by (6.3)), it follows that 
c' = ab(a 2 - a '2) + ab(b' - b) + a6(a' - a) + c 
(6.7) 
From (6.4)' and the expression of as (given by (6.4)), it follows that 
d' = ab(ab - a'b') + a6(b' - b) + d 
(6.8) 
Equation (6.5)' and the expression of an (given by (6.5)) yield: 
e' = ao(a 2 - a '2) + ag(b' - b) + alo(a' - a) + e 
(6.9) 
From (6.6)' and the expression of a12 (given by (6.6)), we get the equality: 
f' = ag(ab - a'b') + alo(b' - b) + f 
(6.10) 
Let us now find the ideal of C{_a, A, .A ~} which expresses the inclusion of ideals I(d) 9 
I(d') C I(q) in the neighborhood of (do, qo, d'o). For each of the nine generators of the 
product I(d). I(d'), one performs the division by the ideal I(q). If R~ denotes the 
remainder of the division of the ith generator of I(d). I(d'), one has from [7r 
: 
R~ = R~,0 + R~,lx + Ri,2x 2 +RI,3 x3 

86 
Construction of the variety B(V) 
where Ri,o, Ri,1, Ri,2 and Ri. 3 are elements of C{a, A, A'}. 
Again from [7~es4], the ideal I(d). I(d') is contained in I(q) if and only if the nine 
remainders R~ are identically zero, which yields the 9 x 4 = 36 equations 
{R,j = O} ..... 
0<_j_<3 
If the remainder of the division of the element (x 2 + ax + b)(x 2 + a'x + b') is denoted 
by R1, one has in particular the expressions : 
/~1,3 
: 
a + a' -- a 1 
R1, 2 
: 
b + b' + aa' - a2 
The expression of the coordinate a' of the doublet d' in the chart C_ of I(V) is obtained 
by the equation R1,3 = 0 : 
a' = al - a 
(6.11) 
From the expression of a', the equation/~1,2 = 0 can be rewritten : 
b' = -b + a(a - al) + a2 
(6.12) 
a' and b' are then replaced by their expressions in terms of a, b, ax, a2 in the equations 
(6.7), (6.8), (6.9) and (6.10). New equations are obtained: 
c' 
= 
a5(a 2 + aid -- a~ -- 2b + a2) + a6(al - 2a) + c 
(6.13) 
d' 
= 
as(a 3 - 2a2 al + aa 2 + a2 + alb - ala2) 
+a6(-2b + a(a - al) + a2) + d 
(6.14) 
e' 
= 
ag(a 2 + ala -- a21 -- 2b + a2) + al0(al - 2a) + e 
(6.15) 
f' 
= 
a9(a 3 - 2a2al + aa21 + a2 + alb - ala2) 
+al0(-2b + a(a - al) + a2) + f 
(6.16) 
From these six equations, the coordinates of the residual doublet d' can be expressed 
in the chart C_ of [(V). 
Then we check with Macaulay 
that when a',...,f' 
are 
replaced by their expressions in terms of (al, a2, a5, a6, a9, al0, a, b, c, d, e, f), the equa- 
tions (6.1)', (6.2)', {R~j = 0},<,<9 are satisfied. Thus, the variety B(V) 
is locally 
0</_<3 
obtained as the graph of a morphism : 
C 12 
...+ C 12 
C_ = (al, a2, as, a6, a9, alo, a, b, c, d, e, f) ~ (a3, a4, aT, as, all, a12, a', b', c', d ~, e', f') 
(6.17) 
So, the variety B(V) is smooth at ~o, since it is locally isomorphic to the variety C xz. 
This proves proposition 5. 

Non-singularity of the variety B(V) 
87 
The case of the square quadruplet 
Now, we are going to prove the non-singularity of the variety B(V) at ~ where q E 
H4(V) is a square quadruplet, which is represented by the following symbol : 
II 
First, we state a lemma which gives the form of the elements ~ in the fiber over such 
a quadruplet : 
Lemma 10 Let qo be a square quadruplet of support the point p of V. The elements 
of the fiber lr-l(qo) C B(V) over the quadruplet qo are of the form (d~,qo,d_~)~c c 
where d~ is the doublet contained in the quadruplet qo of direction a. 
Proof : 
The quadruplet qo is defined by the ideal (x 2, y2 z) of Ov (cf. definition 7.(ii)). A 
doublet in the quadruplet qo is fixed. Up to a change of coordinates from x to y, one 
can always assume that this doublet is defined by the ideal (x ~, y + ax, z), where a is 
a scalar. The figure below represents the element (d~, qo) of I(V) : 
Y 
m 
~ 
X 
The residual doublet is necessarily contained in the open set of the non-vertical dou- 
blets. Indeed, the ideal correponding to the vertical doublet is I = (y2 x, z) and the 
inclusion I(d~) 9 I C I(qo) is not satisfied because the element (y + ax)x does not 
belong to the ideal I(qo) = (x 2, y2, z). Thus, the residual doublet d' is defined by an 
ideal of the form (x 2, y + fix, z). The inclusion I(d,). I(d') C I(qo) will be verified if 
and only if the element (y + ax)(y + fix) is in I(qo) = (x 2, y2 z), which is equivalent 
to the condition a +/3 = 0. 
[::] 
Let us now prove the following proposition : 
Proposition 6 The variety B(V) is non-singular at each element (d, qo, d') C B(V) 
where qo E H4(V) is a square quadruplet. 
Proof : 
In order to prove the non-singularity of the variety B(V) at each element (d, qo, d') 
where qo is a square quadruplet, we will just prove the non-singularity at the most 

88 
Construction of the variety B(V) 
degenerate element, i.e. when the two doublets d and d' are identical and horizontal 
(cf. lemma 10). The different elements of the fiber 7r l(qo) C B(V) are represented 
below : 
Y 
Y 
d'=d_~ 
Extreme case 
X 
d~ d I ~do 
Computations performed for the extreme case will yield the non-singularity of the 
variety B(V) at each element (d, qo, d'). 
As the square quadruplet qo is defined by the ideal (x 2, y2, z), a quadruplet q close 
to qo in H4(V) is given by the ideal 
I(q) = 
(x 2 -1- alxy -1- a2z q- day + a4, y2 + a5xy + a6x + aTy + as, 
z + aoxy + alox + any + a12) , 
so that _a = (al,..., a12) forms a chart of H4(V) at qo. At the most degenerate point 
go = (do, qo, d'o) of the fiber 7r-l(qo) C B(V), the two doublets are identical and defined 
by the same ideal (x 2, y, z) (cf. lemma 10). As before, a doublet d in the neighborhood 
of do in H2(V) is given by the ideal 
I(d) = (x 2 + ax + b,-y + cx + d,-z + ex + f) 
The chart of H2(V) at do is denoted by A = (a, b, c,d, e, f). 
Similarly, the ideal 
(x 2 + a'x + b',-y + c'x + d',-z + e'x + f') defines a doublet d' close to d'o. And the 
chart of H2(V) at d'o is denoted by A' = (a', b', c', d', e', f') . 
Let us determine the local equations of the subvariety I(V) of H2(V)â€¢ H4(V) 
at (do, qo). We have to determine the ideal of C{_a,A} which expresses the inclusion 
d C q in the scheme-theoretic sense. To do so, one performs the division of each 
generator of I(q) by the ideal I(d). If Ii denotes the remainder of the division of the 
ith generator of I(q), one has from [T/esl] : 
l~ = l~,o + li,lx 
where l~,0 and 1~,1 are elements of C{a, A}. From ['~e81] again, the inclusion I(q) C I(d) 
will be satisfied if and only if the remainders l~ are non zero, which can be expressed 
by the six equations {l~j = 0} i = 1,2,3 in C[a,A]. More explicitly : 
j =0,1 
11,1 = 
-alac + ald + a2 + a3c- a 
(6.19) 

Non-singularity of the variety B(V)

13a = 
-agac+a9d+a!o+anc+e 
(6.23) 
13,0 = 
-agbc + and+ hi2 + f 
(6.24) 
Therefore these six equations define the subvariety I(V) of H2(V) x H4(V) locally 
at (do,qo). 
These six equations (6.19)-(6.24), taken in this order, enable one to 
express a2, a4, a6, a8, hi0 and a12 as functions of the other coordinates. Thus, C = 
(al, a3, ah, aT, ag, an, a, b, c, d, e, f) forms a chart of I(Y) at (do, qo). 
Let us now determine the residual application Res in these coordinates. 
The inclusion of the residual doublet d I in the quadruplet q in the neighborhood of 
(qo, d~o) is expressed by the six equations {l'i,y = 0}~b~53 in C[a, .4'] where l~,j is obtained 
from li,j by replacing a,..., f by a~,..., f. In particular, we get from the inclusion 
of ideals I(d) 9 [(d') C I(q) that the element (-y + cx + d)(y - cSx - d') is in the 
ideal I(q). From [~esh], the remainder of the division of this element by I(q) is of 
the form ro + rlx + r2xy + ray, where ro,rl,r2 and ra are in C{a, Ar, A}, and the 
condition (-y + cz + d)(y - c'x - d') E I(q) can be expressed by the four equations 
{ri = 0}~=0,...,a. In particular, we get the expressions : 
r2 
= 
c + c I + alcd + a5 
r3 
= 
d + d' + aT + a3cd 
The equation r2 = 0, which can be rewritten as c'(1 + ale) = -as - c, enables one to 
express the parameter c' locally as a graph because the element (1 + ale) is invertible 
in the ring C{C_}. Then one obtains the expression : 
c'= --(ah+C)(l+alc) -1 
(6.25) 
The equation r3 = 0 and the expression of c' yield the following expression for the 
parameter d' in C{C} : 
d' = -d 
- 
a 7 q- a3c(a 5 q- c)(1 q- ale) -1 
(6.26) 
From the expression of a2 (given by (6.19)) and the equation l~, 1 = 0, one gets the 
equality : 
a'(1 +alc') = a(1 + ale) + al(d' -- d) + a3(c' - c) 
From the expression of a4 (given by (6.20)) and the equation l' 
= 0, one gets the 
1,0 
equMity : 
b'(1 +alc') = b(1 + ale) + a3(d' - d) 

90 
Construction of the variety B(V) 
As the element 1 + alc' (= 1 - al(as + c)(1 + alc) 1, by (6.25)) is invertible in the ring 
C{C_}, one rewrites the two following equalities : 
a' = 
[a(l+alc)+al(d'-d)+a3(c'-c)](l+alc') 
-1 
(6.27) 
b' = 
[b(1 +alc) + a3(d'- d)](1 +alc') -1 
(6.28) 
d and d' are then replaced by their expressions in terms of al, a3, a5, aT, c and d in the 
equations (6.27) and (6.28), which enables us to express the coordinates a' and b' of 
the residual doublet in the chart _C_. From the expression of al0 (given by (6.23)) and 
the equation l~, 1 = 0, one gets : 
e'=e-a11(c'-c)+ao(d-d')+a9a'c'-a9ac 
(6.29) 
The expression of o,12 (given by (6.24)) and the equation l'3. o = 0 yield : 
f' = f + a9(b'e' - bc) + all(d - d') 
(6.30) 
It was shown above that a',b',c' and d' are elements of the algebra C{C}. When 
a', b', d and d' are replaced by their expressions in terms of the coordinates C_ in the 
equations (6.29) and (6.30), one gets the expressions of the last two coordinates e' and 
f' of the residual doublet in the chart C 
C_. The coordinates a',..., f' of the residual 
doublet have thus been obtained locally as graphs in the variety C 12 of coordinates C_. 
Then one checks that when a',..., f' are replaced by their expressions in terms of 
the coordinates C_ in the equations/~.0 = 0, l~, 1 = 0 and in the equations given by the 
generators of the ideal of C{_a, 4,.4'} which express the inclusion I(d). I(d') C I(q), 
one gets indeed 0 = 0. Therefore, the variety t?(V) is locally isomorphic at ~o to the 
graph of a morphism :

The variety B(V) is smooth at this point and (al, aa, a5, az, a9, a11, a, b, c, d, e, f) forms 
a chart. 
Remark 10 One can also choose (al, a3, a9, air, a, b, c, d, e, f, d, d') as chart of B(V) 
at qo. In this case, the variety/?(V) is locally isomorphic to the graph of a morphism

These charts will be used for the construction of the variety H4(V) in the product 
[H3(V)] 4 x [B(V)] ~ (cf. w 7.1.2). 
From lemma 10, the other elements of the fiber 7r ~(qo) C B(V) over the square 
quadruplet qo are of the form (d,~,qo,d_(~)(,cc, 
where the doublet d,~ is defined by 
the ideal (x 2, y + ax, z). The computations performed in the neighborhood of (]o = 
(do, %, do) in order to establish a chart of B(V) are still valid for (d~, qo, d_,~). It is 
sufficient to replace c by C-a and d by C' + a in the equations, where C and C' are 
local parameters. This ends the proof of proposition 6. 
Propositions 5 and 6 lead to the non-singularity of the variety B(V) at each element 
where q C H4(V) is a locally complete intersection quadruple point. We now proceed 
in proving the same result when q is no longer a complete intersection. 
6.4.2 
Non-singularity 
of B(V) 
at qo where 
qo is a non-locally 
complete 
intersection 
quadruple 
point 
Recall (cf. definitions 7) that the non-locally complete intersection quadruple points 
are the elongated and spherical quadruplets. Recall also that R(V) denotes the subva- 
riety of H2(V) â€¢ H4(V) â€¢ H2(V), the elements (d, q, d') of which satisfy the inclusions : 
I(d') c r(q) c I@ n I(d') 
The variety R(V) contains the graph ['n,~.~ of the rational residual map Res : I(V) 9 9 --+ 
H2(V) since elements (d, q, d' = q \ d) satisfy the previous inclusions. Therefore, the 
variety R(V) contains B(V), the closure of the graph FR~,, in [(V) x H2(V). 

92 
Construction of the variety B(V) 
The case of the elongated quadruplet 
Recall that if qo E H4(V) is the elongated quadruplet of support the point p of V, 
in an appropriate local coordinate system centered at p, it is defined by the ideal 
(x 3,xy,y2 z) (of. definition 7-(iii)). The following lemma provides a description of 
the elements (d, qo, d') of B(V) : 
Lemma 11 One of the two doublets d, d' which constitutes the element (d, qo, d') of 
B(V) defines the same line as the one defined by the elongated quadruplet qo. 
Proof : 
The two doublets d and d' have the same support as the quadruplet qo. Therefore, 
the question is to prove that one of these two doublets is a subscheme of the curve of 
local equations y = 0 = z. In this system of local coordinates (x, y, z), the doublets d 
and d' are necessarily defined by ideals of the form : 
I(d) 
= 
(x 2,y+~x,z) 
I(d') 
= 
(x 2,y + 
z) 
, 
where /k and A~ are elements in C. Then, the scheme-theoretic inclusions d, d' C qo 
follow. Then one checks that the inclusion [(d) 9 [(d') C I(qo) is equivalent to the 
condition 
~'x 2 9 I(qo) = (x 3, xy, y2, z) 
This condition is equivalent to ~,k' = 0. 
[] 
According to our drawing conventions, the elements (d, %, d') in the fiber 7r-~(qo) C 
B(V) are of the form : 
w 
d

with as extreme case the element ~o = (do,qo,d~) where the doublets do et d~ are 
identical and define the same line as the quadruplet :

Let us now prove the non-singularity of B(V) 
at this element e/o. The 
two doublets do and d~ are defined by the ideal (x2,y,z). 
As before (see (6.18)), 

Non-singularity of the variety B(V) 
93 
A = (a, b, c, d, e, f) denotes a chart of H2(V) at do and Jt ~ = (a', b', d, d ~, e', f') a chart 
of H2(V) at dro. A quadruplet q close to qo in H4(V) is defined by the ideal : 
I(q) = ( 
x 3 +alx 2 +a2x +a3y+a4,xy+a5 
x2 +a6x +aTy+as, 
y2 + agX2 + alOX + ally + a12, z + alax 2 + a14x + a15y + a16) 
where a4, as, alo and a12 are explicit functions of al, a2, a3, a5, a6, aT, a9 and an (cf. 
Appendix B.1), so that _a = (al, a2, a3, as, a6, aT, a9, an, a13, at4, a15, a16) constitutes a 
chart of H4(V) at qo. 
The scheme-theoretic inclusion d C q in the neighborhood of (do, qo) is equivalent to 
the inclusion of ideals 
(.) 
I(q) C I(d) 
and it is expressed by an ideal of C[_a,~] 
which we are going to determine now. For this purpose, one divides each generator 
of I(q) by the ideal I(d) = (x 2 + ax + b,-y 
+ cx + d,-z 
+ ex + f). From [nesl], the 
remainder ri of the division of the ith generator is of the form : 
ri = ri,o + ri,lX 
where r,,0 and r,,1 are elements of C{_a, A}. The inclusion (*) can be expressed by the 
eight equations {r~,j = 0}~<~<~ in c{a,A}. More explicitly, one has the expressions : 
j=0.1

Similarly, the incidence relation d' C q can be expressed in the neighborhood of 
(dro, qo) by the eight equations {r[j = 0}1_<~_<4 in C{a,~_~4 ~} , where r[j is obtained from 
j=O,1

Construction of the variety B(V) 
One adds to the nine generators of the ideal I(d) 9 I(d') combinations of elements of 
[(q), so that one obtains nine new generators P1,"", P9 of the form : 
Pi = P,,o + Pi,lZ + Pi,2z 2 + Pi,3y 
The inclusion (**) is equivalent to the new inclusion (P1,'", Pc) C I(q). This last 
inclusion can be expressed, from [gesG], by the 9 x 4 = 36 equations {P~.j = 0} ,_<~_<~ 
l<_j_<3 
in C[a,__M,~4']. If P1 (resp. -P2, P4 and Ps) denotes the remainder of the division by 
[(q) of flf~ (resp. f]fl, flY2 and f2f~), one has in particular: 
P1,2 
z 
a~ n t- a3a 5 -- ai(a -~ a') -- ct 2 + act' -~- b -~ b' 
(6.39) 
P2,3 = 
-a3as-a~-a3c'+aTa-b 
(6.40) 
P4,3 
= 
--a3a5 
-- a2 -- a3c ~- a7 a! -- b' 
(6.41) 
Ps,2 
= 
as( e + c') - ao + ec' 
(6.42) 
P5,3 
= 
a7(c ~- c') -- all -- d - 
d' 
(6.43) 
The equations r2.1 = 0, r~, 1 = 0,7"4.1 = 0 and r~. 1 = 0 enable one to express the 
parameters d, d', e and e' as Nnctions of the other coordinates. The equations P2,a = 
0, P4,a = 0 and P5,2 = 0 enable one to express b, b' and a0 in terms of aa, as, aT, a, c, a' 
and d. From the equation P1,2 = 0 and the expressions of b and b', one gets the 
following expression for a2 : 
a2 
â€¢ 
--a3(as + c + c') + al - 2a~ + aa' + (a + a)(aT - al ) 
(6.44) 
The equation P5.3 - 0 and the expressions of d and d' yield the equality : 
all 
= 
2a6 ~- aT(c ~- c') - a(a5 -~ c) - a'(a5 -~ c') 
(6.45) 
From the expressions of b and d and the equation r4, 0 = 0, one gets the following 
expression for f : 
f 
= 
ala[aT(a-az)-a3(a~+c')]-a16-als[-a6+a(as+c)-a~c] 
(6.46) 
Similarly, from the expressions of b' and d' and the equation r~, 0 = 0, one gets : 
f' 
: 
- 
- 
+ 
e)] 
- 
- 
+ 
+ 
e') 
- 
(6.47) 
Thus, the equations (6.33), (6.33)', (6.37), (6.37)', (6.38), (6.38)', (6.39) (6.43) enable 
one to express the eleven parameters a2, ag, all, b, d, e, f, D r, d', e', f' as functions of the 
other thirteen coordinates. Let _C_ = (at, a3, as, a6, aT, a13, a14~ a15, a16, a, c, a', c/). These 
eleven parameters are then replaced by their expressions in terms of the coordinates C 
in the other forty-one generators of the variety R(V) (of course, we use Macaulay). 
Only four equations are satisfied. We are left with thirty-seven generators with a zero 
linear part. The ideal of C[C] generated by these thirty-seven generators is denoted 
by J. Therefore the variety/~(V) is locally isomorphic at (do, qo, d'o) to the subvariety 
V(J) of C 13, of coordinates C. 

Non-singularity of the variety B(V) 
95 
Lemma 12 The subvariety V(J) of C 13 is reducible. This subvariety possesses two 
smooth irreducible components, one of dimension 8 and the other of dimension 12. 
Proof : 
One shows (still by using Macaulay) that the ideal J can be rewritten as a 
product J= 
(h).L,where 
h= al+aT-a-a' 
and L is the ideal (a3, a5+c, as+ 
C', al -- a7 -- a, al -- a7 -- a') of C[C_]. The hyperplane V((h)) and the linear subspace 
V(L) of dimension 8 intersect transversally. 
[] 
Then the variety R(V) is the union of two smooth irreducible components, one of 
which is of dimension 12. As recalled at the beginning of w 6.4.0, this variety R(V) 
contains the variety B(V) which is irreducible of dimension 12, from proposition 4. 
Then one concludes that the variety B(V) is locally isomorphic to the hyperplane 
V((h)). Therefore the variety B(V) is non-singular at the element ~o, the most de- 
generate of the fiber 7r-l(qo) C B(V). In the neighborhood of this point, the variety 
B(V) is locally isomorphic to the graph of a morphism : 
C 12 _+ C 12 
(a1,a3, a5, a6,aT, a13, a,4, a15, a16, a,c,e') ~ 
(a2, ag, all,b,d,e,f,a',b',d',e',f') 
and ( al , a3, a5, a6, aT, a13, a14, als, a16, a, c, c I) constitutes a local chart. 
The non-singularity of B(V) at any element of the fiber follows immediately. In- 
deed, from lemma 11, one can always assume the doublet d to be defined by the ideal 
(x 2, y + c~x, z) where c~ is a fixed non zero scalar and the doublet d' to be defined by 
the ideal (x 2, y, z) : 
Y 
q elongated 
A doublet close to d is then defined by the ideal (x 2 + ax + b, -y+ (C - c~)x + d, -z + 
ex + f). c is replaced by (C - a) everywhere in the computations, where C is a 
local parameter. In this case, the variety It(V) is smooth, irreducible of dimension 
12 because the subvariety V(L) of C la is reduced to the empty set - The ideal L of 
C{al, a3, a5, a6, at, a13, a14, a15, a16, a, C, a', c'} contains the element (a 5 + C - a) which 
is invertible. From proposition 4, the inclusion B(V) C R(V) is in fact an equality. 
This ends the proof of the following proposition : 
Proposition 7 The variety B(V) is non-singular at every element (d, q, d') E B(V) 
where q C H4(V) is an elongated quadruplet. 

96 
Construction of the variety B(V) 
To complete the proof of the non-singularity of the variety B(V), it remains to study 
the case of the spherical quadruplet. 
The case of the spherical quadruplet 
If qo E H4(V) is the spherical quadruplet of support the point p of V, it is defined 
by the ideal (x,y, z) z (cf. definition 7.(iv)). In this case, the doublets d and d ~ which 
constitute the element (d, qo, d') of B(V) have the same support the point p and any 
directions. The extreme configuration is obtained when the doublets are identical. 
With our drawing conventions, the elements ~]o are represented as : 
d' 
- 
~ d=d' 
As usual, we prove first the non-singularity of B(V) in the extreme case, i.e. when 
the two doublets do and d'o have the same direction. One can always assume that these 
doublets do and d'o are defined by the ideal (x 2, y, z). As usual, ~ = (a, b, c, d, e, f) 
will denote a local chart of H2(V) at do and ,4' = (a', b', c', d', e', f') a local chart of 
H2(V) at d'o. A quadruplet q close to qo in H4(V) is defined by the ideal : 
I(q) =( 
x 2 + alz + a2y + aaz + a4, xy + a5z + a6y + aTz + as, 
xz + agx + aloy + allz + a12, y2 + al3x + a14Y -t- a15z + a16, 
yz + alTx + alSy + a19 z + a20, z 2 -t- a21x + a2~y + a23z + a24) 
where a4, a8, a12, a16, a20 and a24 are explicit functions of the other eighteen parame- 
ters. These eighteen parameters must also satisfy fifteen linearly independent quadratic 
equations {Hi = 0}1_<i_<15 (cf. appendix 7.3). Let (a) = (al,..., ~4,..., ds,..., 
a~12,..., ai6,. 9 9 a20,. 9 9 a24) (the notation di means that a~ has been removed). Then 
the fifteen quadratic equations constitute in C[a] the local equations of H4(V) at %. 
(Recall that the spherical quadruplets are the singular points of the Hilbert scheme 
H4(V) (see [I2], [F]).) 
The inclusion of schemes d C q in the neighborhood of (do, qo) is equivalent to the 
inclusion of ideals I(q) C I(d) which is expressed by equations in C[a, ~] that we are 
going to determine now. To do so, one divides each of the six generators of the ideal 
I(q) by the ideal I(d). From [7r 
again, the remainder rz of the division of the ith 
generator is of the form : 
~'i = Ti,0 -~ ~i,1 $ 
where rl,o and ri,1 are elements of C{a, __A} 
The previous inclusion of ideals is 
(H~)I<_~" 
then equivalent to the inclusion (r~,..., rG) C I(d). However, the ideal I(d) can not 

Non-singularity of the variety B(V) 
97 
contain such non zero affine linear forms r i = ri, 0 -b ri,lX. The previous inclusion is 
therefore expressed by the 6 x 2 = 12 equations {ri,j = 0}~<,<~. In particular, one has 
j-0,1 
the expressions : 
rl,1 
= 
al + a2c + a3e - a 
(6.48) 
r2,1 
= 
as + aGc + ate - ac + d 
(6.49) 
r3,1 = 
a9 + alOC + alle - ae + f 
(6.50) 
rs,1 = 
azz+alsc+az9e-ace+de+cf 
(6.51) 
Similarly, the scheme-theoretic inclusion d' C q in the neighborhood of (d'o, qo) is 
expressed by the twelve equations {r~,j = 0}1<_,_<~ where r~,j is obtained from ri,j by 
j=0,1 
replacing a,..., f by a',..., f'. 
Let us now determine the equations in C[a, A, al'] which express the inclusion of 
ideals I(d). I(d') C I(q) in the neighborhood of (do, qo, d'o). One adds to each of the 
nine generators of the product I(d) 9 I(d') elements of I(q), in order to obtain nine 
new generators R1, ..., R9 of the form : 
Ri ~- Ri,o -~- ~i,1 x Ay Ri,2y -t- ~i,3 z 
, 
c[_~, x, x'] 
where Rij are elements in 
-- 
The inclusion of ideals I(d). I(d') C I(q) 
' 
(H~)~<~<I~ 
is equivalent to the inclusion (R1,..., R9) C I(q). From [7~esT], the elements Ri are 
necessarily zero in order to be able to satisfy the previous inclusion, which is expressed 
by the 9 â€¢ 4 = 36 equations {R~,2 = 0} ~<~<~. The remainder of the division by the 
0<j<_3 
ideal I(q) of the element (-y + cx + d)(x 2 + a'x + b') (resp. (x ~ + ax + b)(-y + dx + 
d'),(-y+cx 
+d)(-y+c'x 
+d'), (-z +ex + f)(-y+clx 
+d), (-y+cx 
+d)(-z 
+e'x + f') 
and (-z + ex + f)(-z 
+ e'x + f')) is denoted by R2 (resp. R4, Rs, R6, R8 and R9). In 
particular, one gets the expressions :

Claim : All these equations enable us to express the seventeen parameters a, a', b, b', d, 
d', f, if, a13, a14, a15, alT, a18, a19, a21, a22 and a23 in terms of the thirteen other coordi- 
nates al~ a2: a3~ a5, a6~ aT~ a9, alo: all~ c, e~ c1~ e'. 
Let us prove this claim. Let C = (al, a2, a3, as, aG, a7, ag, alo, an, c, e, c', e'). The equa- 
tions rl,1 = 0 and r~, 1 = 0 enable one to express a and a' in terms of the coordinates 
C_C_. The equation r2,1 = 0 and the expression of a yield the expression for d : 
d 
= 
-as + c(al + a2e + a3e - a6) - ate 
(6.63) 
Similarly, one obtains the expression for d' : 
d' 
= 
-as + c'(al + a2c' + a3e' - ae) - ate I 
(6.64) 
From the equation r3j = 0 and the expression of a, one gets the equality : 
= 
-a9 + e(al + a2c + a3e- an) - aloc 
(6.65) 
f 
The expression for f' : 
f' 
= 
--a 9 -Jr- e'(al -]- a2c"-~- a3 e! -- a11) -- aloC" 
(6.66) 
is obtained similarly from the equation r~, 1 = 0 and the expression of a'. 
The equations R5,3 = 0 and R9. 2 = 0 enable one to obtain a15 and a22 in terms of 
the coordinates C. When d and d' are replaced by their expressions in the equation 
R5.2 = 0, one gets the expression for a14 : 
a14 
= 
2a5 + (c + e')(2a6 -- al) -- a2(e 2 + e '2 + ec') -- a3(ec + e'c') 
+aT(e + e') 
(6.67) 
From the equations Rs,1 = 0, (6.63) and (6.64), one gets : 
a13 
= 
cc'[al -4- a2(c -4- c') d- a3(e d- e') -- 2a6] - aT(ec' + e'c) 
(6.68) 
The equations Rs,3 = 0 and (6.63) lead to the expression for a19 : 
a19 
= 
a5 - c[al -~- a2c + a3(e + e') - a6 - an] + a~(e + e') 
(6.69) 
The equations ~/:~6,2 = 0 and (6.65) yield the expression for a18 : 
als 
----- a9 -- e[al + a2(e + c') + a3e -- a6 -- an] + ai0(c + c') 
(6.70) 

Non-singularity of the variety B(V) 
99 
From the equations r5,1 = 0, (6.63), (6.65) and from the expressions of a18 and of a19, 
one obtains the equality : 
alz 
= 
ec[al - a6 - alx + a2(c + c') + aa(e + e')] - alocc' - a~ee' 
(6.71) 
From the equations R2.2 = 0, (6.63) and the expression of a', one obtains : 
b' 
= 
a6[al + a2(2c+ c') + a3e' - a6] - a2c[al + a2(c + c') + aa(e + e')] 
+a2aze + aaalOC - aTalo 
(6.72) 
Similarly, the equations R4,2 = 0, (6.64) and the expression for a yield the expression 
b 
= 
a6[al + a2(c + 2c') + aae- a61 - a2c'[al + a2(c+ c') + a3(e + e')] 
+a2aTe' + a3aloc' - aTalo 
(6.73) 
From the equation Rg,1 + era,2 + e'R6,2 = 0 and the expression for als, one gets : 
a21 
= 
--al0(ec' -I- e'c) -~ ee'(a 6 + aae - a,1) 
+e2[ai + a2(c + c') + a3e - a6 - all] 
(6.74) 
Finally, the equation Rg. 3 - Rs. 2 - R6.2 = 0 and the expression for als yield the 
equality : 
a23 
= 
2a9 -~ a6(e - e') ~- all(3e -~- e') -~- al0(C -t- c') 
+a2(e'c - 2ec - ec') - 2ale - 2aae 2 - aaee' 
(6.75) 
The equations r1.1 = r[.1 = R5.3 = R9.2 = 0, and (6.63)-(6.75) then prove the claim. 
Replacing these seventeen parameters by their expressions in terms of the coordi- 
nates C_ in the remaining equations leads to an ideal J in the ring C[C__]. Therefore, the 
variety R(V) is locally isomorphic at (do, qo, d'o) to the subvariety V(J) of C ~a. This 
variety R(V) is locally reducible. The ideal J can indeed be rewritten as a product 
J = (h) 9 L where h = al - a6 -all 
+ a2(c + c') + aa(e + e') and J is the ideal 
(c - c', e - e', aT - a3c, al0 - a2e, a6 -all 
- a2c + aae) of C[C_] and the two subvarieties 
V((h)) and V(L) are obviously transverse. The variety R(V) is the union of two irre- 
ducible components, one of which is smooth of dimension 12 because it is isomorphic 
to V((h)). The other one is smooth of dimension 8 because it is isomorphic to V(L). 
As the subvariety B(V) of R(V) is irreducible of dimension 12 (according to propo- 
sition 4), B(V) is isomorphic to the smooth hypersurface V((h)). The variety B(V) 
is therefore smooth at 4~ The equation h = 0 enables us to obtain the coordinate 
al in terms of the other twelve coordinates. We replace al by its expression in the 
equations (6.48), (6.48)', (6.63)-(6.75). The variety B(V) is then locally isomorphic 
to the graph of a morphism :

Construction of the variety B(V) 
and (a2, aa, as, a6, aT, ag, al0, axl, c, e, c', e') constitutes a local chart. 
If now the two doublets d and d' contained in the spherical quadruplet qo do not 
define the same direction anymore, one can always assume the doublet d to be defined 
by the ideal (x 2, y + ax, z) where a E C* and the doublet d' is defined by the ideal 
(x 2, y, z). The following figure represents this configuration : 
Y 
: x 
d 
d I 
Z 
A doublet close to d is then given by the ideal (x2+ax+b, -y+(C-a)x+d, -z+ex+f). 
In this case, (a, b, C, d, e, f) constitutes a local chart of H2(V) at d. One replaces c by 
(C - a) everywhere in the previous computations. The variety R(V) is then locally 
irreducible, smooth of dimension 12 because the subvariety V(L) of C xa is in this case 
reduced to the empty set - The ideal L of C{al, a2, aa, a5, a6, at, do, al0, all, C, e, d, e'} 
contains the invertible element (C - a - c'). The inclusion B(V) C R(V) is in fact an 
equality, by proposition 4. This proves the non-singularity of B(V) at each element 
(d, %, dr). One has proved the following proposition : 
Proposition 8 The variety B(V) is non-singular at every element (d, q, d') E B(V) 
where q E Hilb4(V) is a spherical quadruplet. 
The proof of theorem 6 is just a consequence of propositions 3, 4, 5 to 8. Let us just 
note that in the case where either Res(d, q), or Res(d', q) is well defined, it would 
have been enough to simply compute the dimension of the tangent space of I(V) at 
(d, q) or at (d', q), in order to prove the non-singularity of B(V). But we were also 
interested in getting local equations which would be useful for the construction of this 
variety H4(V) of quadruplets of V. Beforehand we are going to give a description of 
the elements of the excess component of the variety R(V). 
Description of the elements of the excess component of the variety R(V) 
The subvariety R(V) of H2(V) â€¢ H4(V) â€¢ H2(V) is the union of two irreducible 
components, only one of which dominates H4(V) by the projection II. This dominant 
irreducible component is the variety B(V). Let M(V) be the excess component of 
R(V). The elements of this variety M(V) are elements ~ = (d, q, d ~) in R(V) such 
that : 
- The quadruplet q is a non complete intersection, 
- The doublets d and d' are identical and have the same support that the quadruplet 
q. 
With our drawing conventions, one represents the elements of the variety M(V) as :

The variety M(V) is irreducible, smooth of dimension 8. When the support of the 
quadruplet q is only one point, the variety M(V) is locally isomorphic at ~ to the 
subv~riety V(L) of d 3 (cf. w 6.4.2, p. 95 and 100). 
To summarize, we proved in chapter 6 that the closure of the graph of the residual 
rational map Res defined by : 
ne~: 
I(v) ...-+ HUv) 
(d,q) ...-+ d'=q \ d 
is an irreducible, non-singular variety of dimension 4. dim V. In the next chapter, we 
will use this auxiliary variety to construct the variety H4(V) as a subvariety of the 
smooth and irreducible product [H3(V)] 4 â€¢ [B(V)] 6. Recall that the variety H3(V) 
denotes the variety of complete triplets of V ([LB1]). 

Chapter 7 
A 
Construction of the variety H4(V) 
A 
Let us now give an explicit construction of the variety H4(V) of ordered quadruples 
of V, as a subvariety of the product [Ha(V)] 4 x [B(V)] G where Ha(V) denotes the 
variety of complete triples of V ([LB1]). Let us briefly recall (cf. introduction 0.8) 
how the element 0 of H4(V) can be constructed from a generic quadruplet q. Let 
pX,p2,p3 and p4 be the four simple points which constitute this quadruplet. 
-If tl denotes the triplet contained in the quadruplet q, disjoint from the simple 
point pi, the complete triple in H3(---'~) corresponding to the point (pX,... ,pi,... ,p4) 
in V a is denoted by [i. 
-The doublet, which is the union of the two simple points pi and pa, is denoted by 
d~j, the residual doublet of d~j in q by d(. and the element (dij, q, d'~j) of B(V) by q-~j. 
The element ~ C H4(V) constructed from the point (plp2,pa,p4) of V 4 consists of 
the data (/1,/2,ta,t4, (c]ij)l_</<~_<4)in [H--~(V)] 4 x [B(V)] 6.

The study of the variety H4(V) can be restricted to the case where the support 
of the quadruplet reduces to one point, since (see property 2, page 69) this variety is 
already known when the support of the quadruplet contains more than one point : 
the quadruplet q consists of two points, the variety H4(V) is 
one of the products V x Ha(v) or 'H2(V) x 'H2(V) : 
of a triplet t located at the point p and a simple point m, the 
E H4(V) is equivalent to the data of an element (m, ~) in the

data of an element ~ C H4(V) is in this case equivalent to the data of an element 
(J1, d2) in the product 'H2(V) x 'H2(V). 
In both cases, one deals with a locally smooth (of dimension 12) variety, since it is 
locally the product of two smooth varieties. Moreover, such elements ~ E H4(V) are 
limits of elements of H~(V). 
In section 7.1, it will be shown that the variety H4(V) is smooth at each element 
where q is a locally complete intersection quadruple point and that in the neighbor- 
hood of such elements, the open subset H~(V) is dense in H4(V). The next section 
will be devoted to the study of the neighborhood of the elements ~ where q is a non 
locally complete intersection quadruplet.

Case of the curvilinear 
quadruplet 
Let us see what the elements which can be constructed in H4(V) from an arbitrary 
curvilinear quadruple point are : 
Let qo be a curvilinear quadruplet located at the point p. This quadruplet qo, 
subscheme of a non-singular curve C, can only contain one triplet : it is the (curvi- 
linear) triplet t of support p, subscheme of C. This quadruplet qo also contains only 
one doublet. We are going to show that in the neighborhood of such an element 0o, 
the variety H4(V) is non-singular of dimension 4 9 dim V and that the open subset 
H~(V) is dense in H4(V).The doublets and the triplets contained in the quadruplet 
qo are represented in the following figure :

Let (x,y, z) be a suitable system of local coordinates, centered at p, in which the 
ideal of qo is 
I(qo) = (x 4,y, z) (see definition 7.(i)). The triplet t contained in this 
quadruplet is defined by the ideal (x 3, y, z). The ideal (x 2, y, z) defines the doublet d 
contained in %. 
Remark 12 Since y and z play exactly the same role, we restrict ourselves to the case 
where dim V = 2. In this case, let (x, y) denote a local coordinate system centered at 
p.

Let us express H4(V) in the product [H3(V)] 4 x [B(V)] s or more precisely

In particular, let a[bl = a1215] and a[61 = a~6 ~. Conditions 4 lead to the equalities :

(7.9) 
b#

(7.10) 
For {i, j, k,l} = {1, 2, 3,4}, the equalities a~j = akl and b~j = bkl are consequences 
ij 
of condition 2. Moreover, in the chart (~ij), the expression of a(.,j is a'ij = all ] - aij 
(equation (6.11), page 86). Using the previous equalities, this equation becomes : 
ij 
-x[k] - x[l] = aE1 + (x[i] + 
ij 
This proves that all the all ] are equal to : 
a[1] = 
-(x[1] + x[2] + x[3] + x[4]) 
(7.11) 
Similarly, the expression of b~j in the chart (C_~j) (equation (6.12)) leads to the equality : 
a[2 
]ij 
= 
x[1]x[2] + x[1]x[3] + x[1]x[4] + x[2]x[3] + x[2]x[4] + x[3]x[4] 
(7.12) 
Let a[2] = a~2 ~. Moreover, from condition 5, which can be expressed by the inclusions 
of ideals 
:(pi). :(td c :(q) c I(p i) n I(t,) 
, 
one gets in particular the condition : 
(*) 
(x - x[i])(Y + ~:2 + .iY + "4) 
9 
:(q) 
One adds to this element the element a[5](x 4 + a[1]x 3 + a[2]x 2 + a[a]x + a[4]) + (x[i] - 
x)(y + a[5]x 3 + a[6]x 2 + a[7]x + a[8]) of I(q), in order to obtain the new element Ri : 
Ri 
= 
(-x[i]u/+ a[4]a[5 ] + a[s]x[i]) + (ui + ,ix[i] - a[s] + a[3]a[5] + a[7]x[i])x 
+(#i - x[i])~i - a[7] + a[z]a[5] + a[6]x[i])x 2 + (,~i - a[6] -t- a[1]a[5] + a[s]x[i])x 3 
Thus condition (*) is equivalent to the condition Ri 9 I(q). From result [nes4], w 6.4.0, 
this condition is equivalent to the condition Ri = 0, which implies in particular that 
the coefficient of x a is zero. This yields four equations : 
hi = a[6] -- a[5](a[1] + x[i]) 
which can be rewritten using the expression of a[1] (given by (7.11)) as : 
(ed

From condition 4, one gets in particular the equalities of the doublets 512 =

d12, 523 = d23 = dz3, 513 = dla. These equalities give in particular the equations :

Construction of the variety H4(V) 
Warning : In these equations, dij denotes the sixth coordinate of the doublet 5ij. 
From the expressions in the chart (~) of the right hand sides of these equalities and 
from equation (e4), one gets c12, e3, d12, c23, cl, d23, cl3, c2 and d13 in terms of (C_). 
The equalities of the doublets 514 = D14, 524 = d24 and 534 = d34 give in particular 
the equations : 
dz4=d2+d~ 
d23=dz+d~ 
d34=dl+d~+d'{ 
(Here too, the symbol d~j denotes the sixth coordinate of the doublet ~j.) 
Similarly, one replaces the right hand sides of these equalities by their expressions in 
the chart (_C). Thus, the sixty four coordinates have been obtained as expressions of 
! 
/I 
// 
the other eight coordinates s4, t4, s 4, s 4, s 1 , c4, a(bb hi6]. 
* Then one checks (using Macaulay again) that replacing these sixty four expressions 
in the remaining equations leads to 0 = 0. In other words, the sixty four conditions 
which are necessary to define locally H4(V) in the product [H3(V)] 4 â€¢ [B(V)] 6 are 
sufficient. These sixty four expressions enable one to exhibit locally the variety H4(V) 
as the graph of a morphism from C s to C ~4 where C "~ has coordinates (C). Then the 
variety H4(V) is non-singular of dimension 4 9 dimV in the neighborhood of c]o and 
(_C_) = (s4, t4, s~, s~, s~ ~, c4, a[5], a[6]) constitutes a local chart. Moreover, the expression 
of this chart proves that in the neighborhood of 4~ the open subset H~(V) is dense 
in H4(V). 
7.1.2 
Case of the square 
quadruplet 
In the next section, we prove the non-singularity of this variety at each element 
where q is a square quadruplet. 
We also prove that such elements ~ are limits of 
elements of the open subset HI(V ) . 
Starting with such a quadruplet q, let us see what the various elements which can 
be contructed in H4(V) are. Such a quadruplet q can only contain one triplet, which 
is amorphous. From lemma 10, only three of these six doublets contained in the 
quadruplet can be arbitrary. Recall that if d~, is a doublet of direction a contained 
in q, the complementary doublet of d, in q is the doublet of direction -a. Of course, 
A 
in order to prove the non-singularity of H4(V) at such elements, we will restrict the 
computations to the most degenerate point q, i.e. when the six doublets are identical. 
Let qo be a square quadruplet located at a point p of V. Consider a convenient 
local coordinate system (x, y, z) centered at p in which the quadruplet qo is defined 
by the ideal (x 2, y2, z) of Oy (cf. definition 7.(ii)) and the six doublets are defined 
by the same ideal (x 2, y, z). The only triplet t contained in qo is then defined by the 
ideal (x 2, xy, y2, z).

the equations :

Since the elements (1 + a[1]c12 ) and (1 + a[1]c14 ) are invertible in the algebra C{C_}, 
these two equalities enable us to obtain the coordinates c34 and c23 as elements of

When one writes the scheme-theoretic inclusions ti C q, which are equivalent to the

(7.15)

(7.16) 
Then one divides each of these elements by the ideal I(t~) (the form of the remainder 
is given by [~es3]). Condition (7.15) yields in particular the equalities : 
(eqi) 
a[3] - v~ - a[1]v~ = 0 
(This term corresponds to the coefficient of y in the expression of the remainder.) 
Condition (7.16) gives in particular the equations : 
(Ei) 
ar 
- Pi - aguli = 0 
( Fi) 
a[11] - ai - agv~ = 0 
(These two expressions correspond to the coefficients of x and y of the remainder of 
the division.) From equation (eqi) and the expression of v~ in the chart (7-/), one 
obtains the new equations : 
(eq4)' 
v4(1 + a[1]c23) = a[a] + all]S4 
(eq3)' 
v3(1 + a[1]c24) = a[3] + all]S4

(eql)' 
Vl(1 q- a[1]c34) -- a[3] q- a[1](s4 - v4(e23 - c13)) 
Equation (eq3)' enables one to express the coordinate v3 in the ring C{C__}, since the 
element (1 + all]e24 ) is invertible. 
From equations (7.13) and (7.14), the elements 
(1+a[,]c34) and (1+a[1]c23) ofC{C} are invertible. Equations (eq4)' and (eq2)' enable us 
to express the coordinates v4 and v2 in C{C__}. Thus, equation (eql)' enables us to obtain 
the coordinate Vl as an element of C{C}. From equations (Fi) and the expressions 

The variety H4(V) at ~ where q is a non 1.c.i quadruplet 
111 
of v~ in the chart (C), one obtains expressions for the coordinates a~. Then, the 
expressions of c4, c~, v4, a4 in <:{C} and equations (Eq) enable one to obtain Sl, tl and 
rl as elements of C{C_}. Equation (E~) (i = 1,2, 3) is replaced by (E,)' = (Ei) - (E4), 
which can be rewritten as :

These three equations and the expressions of v{ in C{C_} enable us to obtain expressions 
for ;91,;92 and ;ga in the ring C{C_}. One writes explicitly the equalities 512 = d12, 
51s = d13, 523 = d23, 514 = D14, 524 = ~24 and 5a4 = D34 on the coordinates of the 
doublets. Thus one obtains expressions in C{C_} for the coordinates aij, b~j, dij, eij, fij 
of the doublets 6ij since the right hand sides of these equalities are elements of C{C__}. 
Thus, the ninety six coordinates have been obtained as elements of the algebra C{C_}. 
9 Then one checks that when these ninety six expressions are plugged into the remain- 
ing equations, one does obtain 0 = 0. Consequently, the variety H4(V) is locally iso- 
morphic to the graph of a morphism from C 12 to C 96 defined in this way. Therefore, the 
variety H4(V) is smooth at this point and (C_) = (s4, t4, r4, c12, c13, c14, c24, a[1], a[3], a[9], 
~[11], P4) constitutes a chart. 
Moreover, the above calculations show that this element ~o is in the closure of the 
open subset H~(V). If x[i] denotes the first coordinate of the point p{ contained in 
the support of an element (} in the neighborhood of qo, one has the expressions : 
x[1]--

7.2.1 
Case of the elongated 
quadruplet 
Consider an elongated quadruplet qo E H4(V) located at a point p of V. According 
to the definition 7.(iii), the quadruplet qo is defined by the ideal (x 3, xy, y2, z) of Ov 
for a suitable local coordinate system centered at p. 
For such a quadruplet, let us see what the different elements which can be constructed 
in H4(V) are : 
Recall (see lemma 11) that from such a quadruplet qo, the elements ~o of B(V) all are 
of the form ~o = (d, qo, d') where either d or d' is defined by the ideal (x 2, y, z).

Thus, at an element qo of H4(V), only three of the six doublets d~j,djt,dli, where 
{i,j, l} C {1, 2, 3, 4}, can be arbitrary. Then the other three doublets are identical and 
defined by the ideal (x 2, y, z). The quadruplet qo can contain the amorphous triplet 
t of ideal (x 2,xy, y2, z), as well as the curvilinear triplets t~ defined by the ideals 
(x a, y + ax 2, z) where a E C. The doublets contained in the amorphous triplet t can 
have an arbitrary direction, while, the curvilinear triplet t~ contains only the doublet 
of ideal (x 2, y, z). We can now give the form of the different elements qo E H4(V) : 
(i) The four triplets tl are equal and amorphous, only three of the six doublets con- 
tained in the quadruplet are arbitrary. The other three doublets are identical and 
well determined :

We propose to show the following assertion : 
Assertion : the 108 - 17 = 91 other coordinates are obtained as explicit fonctions 
of these seventeen coordinates C. Moreover, these seventeen coordinates are linked 
together by ten linearly independent quadratic equations. 
Condition (3.1), which defines a complete quadruplet, gives the equations :

y[1] = t 4 -- t 3 = t2

x[21 
= 
x[l] - v4(c23

(7.17) 
In the chart (_Ta), one has the expression for x[2]: 
x[2] 
= 
x[1] - 733(c24 -

 C14 ) 
(7.18) 
Similarly, in the different charts CT~4), (7-2) and (7-1) taken in this order, the coordinate 
x[3] is given by the expression : 
x[3] 
: 
x[1] - v4(c23 - c12) 
(7.19) 
x[3] 
: 
x[1] - v2(c34 - c14) 
(7.20)

(7.21) 
Finally, in the different charts (T_3), (7-2) and (7-1) taken in this order, the coordinate 
x[4] has for expression : 
x[4] 
=

(7.24) 
Then one keeps the generators (7.17), (7.19) and (7.22). One replaces the generator 
(7.18) by the generator (7.18)'= (7.18) - (7.17) : 
~4(c23 - 
c13) 
= 
v3(c24 -

One replaces the generator (7.20) by (7.20)'= (7.20) - (7.19) : 
~4(c2~ -

= 
v2(c34 -

The generator (7.21) is replaced by (7.21)' = (7.21) - (7.19) + (7.1r) : 
v4(c1~ - 
c12) 
= 
~1(c~4 - 
c24) 
The 
generator 
(7.23) 
is replaced by (7.23)'

Construction of the variety H4(V) 
Finally, one replaces the generator (7.24) by (7.24)' = (7.24) - (7.22) + (7.18) : 
v~(c14 - Cl2) 
= 
~1(c34 - c~) 
The five quadratic equations (7.18)', (7.20)', (7.21)', (7.23)' and (7.24)' are necessary 
conditions to express the equalities between the points (condition 3). 
The scheme-theoretic inclusions 6~j C t~, for {i,j, k} C {1, 2, 3, 4} enable us to obtain 
in particular the expressions for the coordinates aij : 
a,) = -x[i] - x[j]. 
From the inclusions I(ti). I(p ~) C I(q) (condition 5), it follows in particular that the 
generator (z 2 + ulx + viy + wi)(x - z[i]) belongs to the ideal I(q). One adds to this 
generator an element of I(q) in order to obtain the new element R, : 
Ri = 
x2(-a[1] - a[5]vi - x[i] + ui) + x(-uix[i] - wi - a[2] - a[6]vi) 
y(-x[i]~, 
- aE~ I - aETl~ ) - 
(x[i]w~ + dE41 + acsl~) 
Therefore, the condition (x 2 + uix + viy + wi)(x - x[/]) E I(q) is equivalent to the 
condition R~ E I(q). From result [Ties6] one obtains in particular the four equations : 
We keep equation (el), which one rewrites by using the expression of Ul : 
a[1] = --3x[1] + y1(c34 - 
c24 - 
c23 -- a[5]) + 21)4(c23-- 
c13) 
One replaces equation (e2) by (e2) - (el), which one rewrites by using the expressions 
of Ul,U2,X[2] and the quadratic equations (7.18)', (7.23)' and (7.24)': 
~(ai~ 1 + c~) 
= 
~(~E~3 + cl~) 
(7.25) 
One replaces equation (e3) by (ea) - (el), which one rewrites by using the expressions 
of ul, u3, x[3] and the quadratic equations (7.18)' and (7.21)' : 
~l(~E~l + c:3) 
= 
.~(a~] + c1:) 
(7.26) 
Similarly, one replaces equation (e4) by (e4) - (el), which one rewrites by using the 
expressions of ul, u4, x[4] and the quadratic equations (7.18)' and (7.24)' : 
~gl(a[5 ] -[- C24 ) 
~-- 
v4(a[51 -~ C12 ) 
(7.27) 
On the other hand, we have seen (section 6.4.2) that the coordinate a~j of the doublet 
5'ij is given in the chart C_ij by the expression : 
a'ij = a[11 + a[7] -- aij 
The equalities ~ a~i 
= 
au 
lead to the equality 
( a,j 
= 
-x[i] 
- ~[j] 
a[7] = -(a[l] + x[1] + x[2] + x[3] + x[4]) 

A 
The variety H4(V) at ~ where q is a non 1.c.i quadruplet 
117 
When a[1], x[2], x[3] and x[4] are replaced by their expressions in terms of the coordi- 
nates C, this equality becomes : 
dE71 = vl(a[5 j + c23) + v3(c24 - c1~) - x[1] 
We have seen (equation (6.42)) that the expression in the chart (C~j) of the parameters 
ij 
a[91 is : 
/ 
Using the conditions c(,j = ct:l, these equalities can be rewritten as : 
a~ 
= 
a~9 ~ = 
a[5](c12 -I- c34) -t- c12c34 
a~

14 
a~ 
= 
a[9 ] = 
a[5](e14 -t- c23) -t- c14c23 
ij 
Then the equality of the coordinates a[9 ] of the quadruplets (consequence of condi- 
tion 1) gives both quadratic equations : 
a[5](e12 ~- e34 ) + e12e34 
a[5](c13 -}- e24 ) + c13c24 
(7.28) 
aE~l(Cl: + e~4) + e,:~4 
= 
aE~l(c14 + ~:~) + e,4c2~ 
(7.29) 
The scheme-theoretic inclusions ti C q, which are equivalent to the inclusions of ideals 
I(q) C I(t~), yield in particular the conditions : 
(*) 
z + a[13]x 2 + a[14]x + a[15]Y + a[16] 
e 
I(tl) 
One adds to this generator an element of I(t~) in order to obtain the new element Ri : 
R~ = ~(~E~l - 
P~ - 
aI~31~,) + Y(aI151 - 
~' - 
aI131~) + (aid

Therefore the conditions (*) are equivalent to the conditions 
Ri C I(ti). From [Nes3], 
these conditions can be translated into the equations :

all5] -- cri -- a[13]vi = 0 
a[16] -- Oi -- wia[13] = 0 
eli) 
(e2/) 
(e3d 
For i = 1,..., 4, equation (e2i) enables us to express al in terms of the coordinates C. 
Similarly, equation (ell) and the expression of ui give Pi in terms of the coordinates 
C. The scheme-theoretic inclusion t4 C q gives in particular the two conditions : 
X 3 -1- a[1]x 2 ~- a[2]x + a[a]y -/- a[4] 
C 
I(t4) 
, 
xy + a[5]x 2 + a[6]x + aF]y + a[8] C 
/(t4) 
The first condition yields in particular the equality : 
a[31 = v4(--v14 -t- a[l] -- u4) 
, 

A 
118 
Construction of the variety H4(V) 
while the second condition gives 
a[6] = u~ + a[5]u4. The expressions which were 
already obtained for u4, u~, v~ and all] enable us to express a[3] and a[6] in terms of the 
coordinates C. Finally, the condition pX C q gives in particular the equation : 
z[1] + a[13]x[1] 2 + a[14]x[1] + a[15]y[1] + a[16] = 0 
which enables us to obtain a[1Gj in terms of the coordinates C. 
Therefore, the ninety one parameters have been obtained as explicit functions of 
the seventeen coordinates g. Then one verifies that the necessary conditions imposed 
by the ten quadratic equations (7.18)', (7.20)', (7.21)', (7.23)', (7.24)', (7.25)-(7.29), 
in order to define the variety H4(V) locally at qo are sufficient. It suffices to replace 
all the expressions obtained above in terms of the coordinates g in the remaining 
equations and to verify that one obtains either 0 = 0, either combinations of these 
ten quadratic equations. One checks that these ten quadratic equations are linearly 
independent. 
Consequently, the variety H4(V) is locally isomorphic at qo to the subvariety of 
C 17, of coordinates C, defined by these ten quadratic equations. Moreover, the compu- 
tations show that this element qo E H4(V) is the limit of elements of H~(V). Indeed, 
if 0 is a complete quadruplet in the neighborhood of 0o, one obtains the expressions 
of the first coordinate of the different points of the support of the quadruplet : 
x[2] =x[l]--v4(c23--c13) 
x[3] 
= x[1] --v4(c23 --c12) 
x[41 
: x[1] --Y3(c24--c12 ) 
and one checks that the differences x[2] - x[3], x[2] - x[4] and x[3] - x[4] are not 
combinations of the ten previous equations. Next, we prove the proposition : 
A 
Proposition 9 The variety H4(V) is singular of dimension 12 at 0~ 
Proof 9 
We saw that the ten quadratic equations (7.18)', (7.20)', (7.21)', (7.23)', (7.24)',

The ideal I generated by the ten quadratic equations can be rewritten in the ring

These generators are independent of the seven coordinates a[s}, a[13j, a[14j, a[15], x[1], y[1] 
and z[1]. Therefore the subvariety V(I) of C 17 is a product H x C 7 where H is the 
subvariety of C 1~ of affine coordinate ring C[X1,..., Xlo], defined by the ideal I, and 
the coordinates of C 7 are a[5], a[13] , all41 , a[~51, x[1], y[1] and z[l]. Therefore the variety 
H4(V) is locally isomorphic to the product H â€¢ C 7. In order to prove the proposition, 
one has to prove that the subvariety H C C 1~ is singular, of dimension 12 - 7 = 5. As 
the ideal I is homogeneous, one must just study the projective subvariety FH C ?C l~ 
associated to the subvariety H C C 1~ From now on, the projective space associated to 
the vector space C 1~ is denoted by ?9. The affine open subset of F 9 consisting of points 
of homogeneous coordinates IX1 : '" : X10] such that Xi # 0 is denoted by Ui. This 
affine open U,, of coordinate ring C[X1,..., Xlo, Xi-1]0 is isomorphic to the variety 
C v, of coordinate ring C[Xl,..., xi-l,zi+l,..., Xl0]. (The isomorphism is given by 
xj = Xj for j â€¢ i.) We now show that the variety ?H is singular, of dimension 4, and 
Xi ' 
irreducible. Through the isomorphism Ui --% r 9, the ideal I N r

Construction of the variety H4(V) 
From equations (7.31), (7.33), (7.37), the coordinates x9,xlo and xs are obtained 
as explicit functions of the other coordinates. When one substitutes x8,x9 and xl0 
by these expressions into the seven other generators of the ideal I1, the generator 
(7.34) becomes proportional to (7.36), the generator (7.39) becomes proportionnal 
to (7.30) and the equations (7.35) and (7.38) are satisfied. The subvariety V(Ia) of 
C 9 is isomorphic to the subvariety of ~, of coordinate ring C[x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, xT], 
generated by the three generators (7.30), (7.32) and (7.36). It is nothing else than 
the determinantal variety defined by : 
= 
E M2x3(C) s.t. rankM < 1} 
X5 
X 6 
X7 
which is irreducible of dimension 4, as it is shown in the following lemma :

is irreducible, of dimension 4, and singular at the origin. 
Proof : 
The condition rankM < 1 can be rewritten as : 
Z1Z s 
= 
Z2Z 4 
Z1Z 6 
= 
Z3Z 4 
Z2 Z6 
= 
Z 3 Z5 
One easily checks that the projective subvariety PM1 C I? 5 associated to the variety 
M1 is irreducible, smooth, of dimension 3. 
[] 
On the open set U1, the variety 1?H is isomorphic to the variety M1 and is therefore 
irreducible of dimension 4 and singular at the origin. The origin of this affine open 
subset U1 corresponds to the point A1 E p9 of homogeneous coordinates [1 : 0 : ... :0]. 
9 Similarly, one checks that on the nine other open sets Ui of the covering, the variety 
I?H is isomorphic to the determinantal variety M1 and that the singular point of M1 
corresponds to the point Ai of p9 of homogenous coordinates [0 : 9 .. : 0 : 1 : 0 : ... : 0] 
(the 1 is the i th component). 
Therefore, one has proved that the variety PH is irreducible, of dimension 4, and 
that its singular locus is the union of the ten points Ai of p9. Consequently the subvari- 
ety H x C C C t~ x C 7 is irreducible of dimension 12 = 5 + 7, and its singular locus is the 
union of the ten subvector spaces ~ of C lz where V/= V(X1,..., Xi-1, Xi+l,..., Xlo). 
As in the neighborhood of ~o the variety H4(V) is locally isomorphic to the product 
H x C 7, it follows that this variety is singular of dimension 12 at ~o. Therefore, 
proposition 9 is proved. 

A 
The variety H4(V) at 2 where q is a non l.c.i quadruplet 
121 
In the neighborhood of qo , the singular locus sing(H4(V)) of Ha(V) is the union 
of the ten subvarieties ]2~ C H4(V). These ten subvarieties are smooth, of dimension 
8. The subvariety )2i is locally isomorphic to the vector space V/. 
Geometric description of the variety sing(H4(V)) at qo : 
In this section, we give a geometric description of the singular locus sing(H4(V)) of the 
variety H4(V) in the neighborhood of 2~ Recall that V/is the subvector space of C 1~, of 
dimension 8, defined by the equations: X1 ..... 
Xi-1 = X~+t ..... 
Xlo = 0. At 
an element 2 of sing(H4(V)) in the neighborhood of 20, the quadruplet q is elongated 
and its support p has coordinates (x[1], y[1], z[1]). Then one performs the change of 
origin : 
x 
= 
x-x[1] 
y 
= 
x - y[1] 
z 
= 
z-z[1] 
In the local coordinate system (X, y, Z) centered at p, the quadruplet q is defined by 
the ideal : 
I(q) = (X 3, X(y + a[5]X), (y + a[5]X) 2, Z + a[13]X 2 + (a[14] -{- 2a[13]x[1])X + a[15]Y) 
This ideal does define an elongated quadruplet (cf. definition 7.(iii)). 
9 Geometric description of an element 2 of V~, for i = 1,..., 4 : 
At such an element, all the doublets and all the triplets have the same support, the 
point p of V. An element of V1 U ])2 U V3 U ];4 satisfies the conditions : X5 ..... 
Xlo = 0, which can be rewritten as clj = -a[5]. (The coordinate c~ i corresponds to 
the direction defined by the doublet d~j C q.) These six equations yield the equality 
of the six doublets. 
One checks that these six doublets are defined by the ideal 
(X 2, y + a[512( , Z + (a[14] + 2a[13]x[1]),-Y + a[15]Y). 
For j = 1,..., 4, the condition Xj = 0, which can be written as vj = 0, is equivalent 
to the condition : the triplet tj is amorphous. Thus, for i = 1,..., 4, the triplet ti is 
generically curvilinear at an element 2 E ];i (since X~ = v~ is generically non zero on 
V~). This triplet is defined by the ideal : 
I(t,) = ( X 2 + v~(y + a[5]X), XN - a[5]vz(Y + a[s]X), 
y2 + a[5]2vz(y + a[5]X), Z + a[13]X 2 + (a[14] + 2a[13]x[1])X + a[15lY ) 
which can be rewritten as follows, if v~ is non zero : 
I(t,) -- (X 2 + vi(y + a[5]X), X 3, Z + a[13]X 2 + (a[la] + 2a[13]x[1])X + a[ts]Y) 
The other three triplets are amorphous and defined by the ideal : 
(X 2, Xy, y2, Z + (a[141 + 2ai~31x[1])X + ai,51y ) 

122 
Construction of the variety H4(V) 
Thus, for i = 1,... ,4, at a generic element ~ of Pi, the six doublets are identical, 
the triplet t~ is generically curvilinear and the other three triplets are (identical and) 
amorphous. On can represent a generic element ~ E ]2~ as : 
I t~ curvilinear 
tj = t~ = (amorphous//~ 
) 
d~j identical 
9 Geometric description of an element ~ of Vi, for i = 5,..., 10 : 
For i = 5,..., 10, the elements ~ of ]2i verify the equalities 
X1 = X2 = X3 = )(4 = 0. 
These equalities, which can be rewritten as 
Vl = v2 = v3 = v4 = 0, mean that the 
four triplets are amorphous. These four triplets are defined by the ideal : 
I(t~) = (X 2, ,3c'y, y2, Z, + (a[14) + 2a[13]x[1]),'Y + a[15]Y) 
At an element ~ of ]21, five of the six doublets are identical and defined by the ideal : 
(X 2, Y + a[5]X, Z + (a[14] + 2a[13}x[1])X + a[15]Y) 
The sixth doublet dkl contained in q (the doublet for which Xi = a[5] + ckt is generically 
non zero) has an arbitrary direction. This doublet dkt is defined by the ideal : 
I(dkz) = (X '2, Y + cklX, Z + (a[14] + 2a[13]x[ll)X + a[15]Y) 
Thus, for i = 5,..., 10, at a generic element ~ of ]2~, five of the six doublets are 
identical, the sixth doublet contained in q has an arbitrary direction and the four 
triplets are amorphous (and identical). On ]25 (resp. ]2G, ]27, ]28, ]29 and ]210) it is the 
doublet d12 (resp. d13, d14, d23, d24 and d34) which has an arbitrary direction. 
Consequently, in the neighborhood of 4~ the singular locus of H4(V) consists of 
the following elements : 
- The quadruplet q is elongated, the six doublets contained in q are identical, only 
one of the four triplets contained in the quadruplet is curvilinear. The other three 
triplets are amorphous : 
( 
l only one curvilinear triplet 
// 
"- 
) 
dij identical 
//~ 
three amorphous triplets 
- The quadruplet q is elongated, only one of the six doublets contained in q has 
an arbitrary direction. The other five doublets all define the same direction as that

Now, let qo denote the spherical quadruplet of support the point p of V. Such a 
quadruplet can only contain amorphous triplets. 
We are going to determine local 
equations of H4(V) in the product [H3(V)] 4 â€¢ [B(V)] 6 at the most degenerate element 
~o, i.e. when the four triplets are identical (and amorphous) and the six doublets are 
identical. In an appropriate system (x,y, z) of local coordinates centered at p, the 
triplets are defined by the ideal (x 2, xy, y2, z) and the doublets have for ideal (x 2, y, z). 
Let ~o = (t~ Â§176 Â§176 ~o ~12

(x[1], y[1], z[1], P4, 01, 02, (73, 0.4, a[2], aft], 
will be also denoted by (C). 
Let us show the following assertion : 
Assertion : the 108 - 17 = 91 other coordinates are explicit functions of the seven- 
teen coordinates C. Moreover, these seventeen coordinates are linked by ten linearly 
independent equations. 
The computations performed in 7.2.1 to express the equalities of the coordinates of 
the points of V (condition 3) are still valid (equations (7.17)-(7.24)). Therefore, one 
has again the five quadratic equations (7.18)', (7.20)', (7.21)', (7.23)' and (7.24)'. 
Condition 2 (5~1 = 5kl) enables us to obtain again the equalities 
(*) (see page 114), 
as well as the equalities e'q = ekl, for {i,j,k,l} = {1,2,3,4}. The equations (**) 
which were established in 7.2.1, page 115 are again satisfied. Condition 1 gives in 
particular the equalities : 
q ----a}l ~ for 
l E {2,3,7} 
a[z] 
Then, let aft] = a[~, in order to simplify the notation. The scheme-theoretic inclusions 
tz C q (condition 5), which are equivalent to the inclusion of ideals I(q) C I(t~), yields 
in particular the condition : 
x 2 + a~]x + a[2]y + a[3]z + a~4 l] 
E 
I(t~) 
If Ri denotes the remainder of the division of this element by the ideal I(ti), the 
previous condition becomes Ri = 0. This condition gives in particular the equations : 
vl -- a[2]-a[310.i 
, 
the element a[2] - v~ - a[310, i being the coefficient of y in the remainder R~. 
One substitutes vl, v2, v3 and v4 by their expressions in terms of the coordinates C 
into the equations (7.18)', (7.20)', (7.21)', (7.23)' and (7.24)'. One obtains the new 
expressions :

(7.47) 
Then, the six equalities on the right hand side enable us to express the coordinates 
el2, el3, e14, e23, e24 and e34 in terms of the coordinates C. Moreover, the inclusion of 
ideals I(q) C I(ti) (condition 5) gives in particular the conditions :

Let rl denote the remainder of the division of this element by the ideal I(t~). The 
previous conditions become ri = 0. In particular, the coefficients of x and of y of the 
remainder ri must be equal to zero, which leads to the equations : 
12 
i 
a[5 ] = 
u4 + a[z]p4 
12 
a[6 ] =

The first equation can be rewritten as : a~5 ~ = -t4- c12c13(a[2]- a[310"4)+ a[7]P4. Using 
the expression of v~, the equation (E4) can be rewritten as : 
12 
a[6 ] = a[7]a4 + (a[23 - a[310-4)c23 - s4 
For j = 1, 2, 3, one replaces the equation (Ej) by (Ej)' = (Ej) - (E4), which one 
rewrites as : 
a[7](0-1 -- 04) 3r- a[2](c34 -

One divides each element by the ideal I(q). The form of the remainder of the division 
is given by the result [T~esT]. Since this remainder must be equal to zero, one has in 
particular the four equations : 
a~211] = - x[i] -- a[710"i - a[3]pi 
(eq~) 
(This expression corresponds to the coefficient of z in the remainder.) Equation (eql) 
and the expression of fll in the chart C enable one to obtain an expression for the 
coordinate a~21] in terms of the coordinates C. For j = 2, 3, 4, one replaces equation 
(eqj) by (eqj)' = (eqj) - (eql), which one rewrites as: 
(0"2 -- 0"1)(a[7] -- a[3]c34)

(a[2] -- a[310"4)(c23 -- c13)

The condition xz + a~x + a~o]y + a~121]z + a~2] C I(t4), which is a consequence of the

(6.56), p. 97 and the equalities c<

The ninety one coordinates have been obtained explicitly in terms of the other sev- 
enteen C. One checks that one obtains either 0 = 0, or combinations of the sixteen 
equations (7.40) - (7.55) in the ring C[C], when these ninety one expressions are substi- 
tuted in the remaining equations. Then one verifies that the ideal I of C[C], generated

A 
The variety H4(V) is locally isomorphic at ~o to the subvariety of C 17 of coordinates 
(C), defined by these ten equations. Since the generators of I are independent of the 
coordinates x[1], y[1], z[1] and P4, consequently the variety H4(V) is locally isomorphic 
to the product V(I) x C 4 C C 13 â€¢ C 4, where I is in this case considered as an ideal 
of the ring C[0-1,0-2, ~r3, 0-4, a[2], a[3], a[r], c12, c13, c14, c23, c24, c34]. One checks that the 
subvariety V(I) of C 13 is irreducible, singular, of dimension 8. As a consequence, 
the variety H4(V) is singular of dimension 12(= 8 + 4) at the point qo. The local 
equations of H4(V) being in this case slightly more complicated, we have not been 
able so far to obtain a geometric description of the singular locus sing(H4(y)) in 
the neighborhood of this element 2~ However, the computations enable us to prove 
that in the neighborhood of this element ~o, the open set H~(V) is dense. The first 
coordinate x[i] of the point pi contained in the support of an element close to qo has 
for expression : 
x[2] 
= 
x[1] - (a[2] - a[310-4)(c23 - c13) 
x[3] 
-- 
x[l] - (a[2] - a[310-4)(c23 - c12) 
z[4] 
= 
x[1] - (a[2] - a[310-2)(c34 - c13) 
and one checks that the differences (x[2] - z[3]), (x[2] - x[4]), (x[3] - x[4]) are not 
elements of the ideal I.

7.3 
Irreducibility 
of H4(V) 
We saw in the introduction of this chapter that when the support of the element 
2 E H4(V) contains at least two points, the variety H4(V) is locally isomorphic to 
one of the two products 'H2(V) x' H2(V), Y x H3(V). Therefore such an element 
is the limit of elements of the open subset H~(V). The computations performed in 
sections 7.1 and 7.2 show that when q is a quadruple point, the element 2 E H4(V) 

128 
Construction of the variety H4(V) 
A 
is again in the closure of the open set H~(V). (See sections 7.1 and 7.2 for explicit 
deformations of a quadruple point into a simple quadruplet.) Consequently, the open 
set HI(V ) is dense in H4(V). The variety constructed in this way is irreducible, of 
dimension 12(= 4.dim V). 
Furthermore, the projection : 
H4(V) --+ H4(V) 
q ~ 
q 
is generically a 4!-sheeted cover, because the open set HI(V ) is dense in g4(y) (IF], 
[I2]). 


Appendix A 
In this appendix, one recalls the local equations of the variety of complete triples of 
V, derived in [LB1].

A.1 
Local 
chart 
of/-/3(V) 
at [, where 
t is a curvilinear 
triple 
point 
Assume that the variety V is of dimension 2. Let us denote by t~ a curvilinear triplet 
of support the point p of V. Such a triplet can only contain one doublet d. In the 
neighborhood of the complete triplet t~ = (p,p,p,d,d, d,t~ 
the variety Ha('--'~) is 
isomorphic to the graph of a morphism from C 6 to fi TM. We recall here its expression. 
In an appropriate local coordinate system (x,y) centered at p, the triplet t~ is 
defined by the ideal (x 3, y). Therefore the doublet d is defined by the ideal (x 2, y). A 
triplet t4 close to t~ is defined by the ideal : 
I(t4) = (x 3 + ~4x 2 + 9~x + ~, y + ~x2 + ,4x + -4) 
One defines the doublets d12, d23 and d13 close to d respectively by the ideals : 
I(d12) = (x 2 + a4x + b4, -y + c4x + d4) 
1(d13) = (x 2 Â§ (a4 + a'4)x Â§ b4 + bid, --y + (c4 + d4)x + d4 + d~4) 
I(d23) = (x 2 + (a4 + a' 4 + a~)x + b4 + b'4 + b~, -y + (c4 + c'4 + d~)x + d4 + d'4 + d~)

Remark 15 : We have assumed that the variety V is of dimension 2. For V of 
dimension n, it suffices to replace the coordinate system (x, y) of V by (x, ~7), where 
~7 = (Yl,..., Y~-~) (recall notation 18, p. 44). In this case, the ideal of d is (x 2, ~) and 
the triplet t~ has for ideal (x 3, ~7). Then a triplet t4 in the neighborhood of t~ is given 
by the ideal : 
Similarly, the doublets d12, d23 and d13 in the neighborhood of d are defined by the 
ideals 
I(d12) = (x~ + ~4~ + b4, -Y+ c~x + d~) 
I(d13) = (x 2 + (a4 + a'4)x + 54 -]- Dr4, -y--I- (~4 + 4) x, -~- ~ "Jr- ~)

One recalls here the local equations of the variety Hs(V) in the neighborhood of a 
complete triplet t'~ = (p~,p~,p~,d~2,d~n,d~3, t~) where t~ is an amorphous triplet of 
support the point p of V and the three doublets are identical. In an appropriate 
local coordinate system (x, y, z) centered at p, the triplet t~ is defined by the ideal 
(x 2, xy, y2, z) and the doublets are defined by the same ideal (x 2, y, z). Then a triplet 
t4 close to t~ is given by the ideal 
(x 2 + u4x + v4y + ~4,

Appendix B 
According to [BGS], [Gr], [I1], it is always possible to determine explicitly the neigh- 
borhood of H"(V) at a n-uple point .~, which one identifies with the flattener of a germ 
of an application. (We have at our disposal the division theorem with parameters of 
Galligo ([Gall) to compute explicitly the flattener of a germ of an application.) 
In this section, we give local equations of the Hilbert scheme H4(V) in the neigh- 
borhood of non-locally complete intersections quadruplets. Recall that we have as- 
sumed dim V = 3. Then, let { be a point of the Hilbert scheme H*'(V), of support 
the point p of V. The ideal of Ov which defines this n-uplet is denoted by I({). One 
denotes by (x, y, z) a local coordinate system centered at p. Briangon, Granger and 
Speder (cf. [BGS], [Gr], [I1]) have found a method to obtain explicitly local equations 
of Hn(V) at ~ : 
One denotes by (f~,..., s 
the standard basis of the ideal I({) (once the direction 
Ov 
has been chosen). The quotient 
is a C-vector space of dimension n. One 
(fl, .., s 
denotes by A = {gi-1,. 9 e77,,} a basis of this C-vector space where el,..., en are elements 
of Ov. Let Fi = fi + ~j'~=laijej, for i = 1,...,n, where all the parameters aij are 
elements of C. The set of these pn parameters is denoted by (_a). Let Os = C{_a}. 
The family (Fx,..., Fv) defines a morphism at the origin of C a x O" parametred by 
(x,y, z), (_a). In the neighborhood of the origin, one considers the subvariety X of 
C a x ~ 
defined by the cancellation of the polynomials F~ (x, y, z, a_),..., Fp(x, y, z, a). 
This subvariety X = V((F~,..., Fv) ) possesses a projection onto O "~, which is the 
restriction to X of the projection from the product C a x G "~ onto the second factor : 
(X,0)

Brian~on, Granger and Speder ([BGS], [Gr], [I1]) have shown that the Hilbert 
scheme Hn(V) is locally isomorphic at ~ to the flattener of II. The equations of 
this flattener can be obtained in the following manner, according to [Gal] - proposi- 
tion 1.4.7 : 
One constructs a basis {(Ej) = (Eli,..., Evj)} of relations between the fi. There- 

Local cha.rt of H4(V) at an elongated quadruplet 
133 
fore, for each j, one has the equality : 
P 
~_, E~j fi = 0 
i=1 
One creates in Os{x, y, z} the products : 
P 
~tj = Z E~jF~ 
i=1 
Then one constructs the remainders of the division of the Mj by the family (F1,..., F~,) 
(cf. [Gal] theorem 1.2.7). One has 
H i = ~ hj~(a)~, 
i=1 
Os{z, y, ~} 
(This remainder is not zero if (F~, 777~ is not a Sat C%-module.) 
The equations {s 
= 0} are the equations in Os which define H~(V) locally 
at. (. So, when ~ is a locally complete intersection n-uplet, ( is defined by the ideal 
I(() = (fl, f2, fa) of Ov. For j = 1, 2, 3, let Fj = fj +~'=~ %{e{, where the parameters 
aj{ are elements oft. Then the ideal (F1, F2, Fa) defines a n-uplet in the neighborhood 
of ( in H'~(V) and (aji) constitutes a local chart of H~'(V) at ~. 
B.1 Local chart of H4(V) at an elongated quadruplet 
Let qo be an elongated quadruplet of support a point p of V. In an appropriate local 
coordinate system (x,y, z) centered at p, the quadruplet qo is defined by the ideal 
I(qo) = (z a, zy, y2, z) of Ov (cf. definition 7.(iii), p. 67). Let I(qo) = (fl, fa, fa, f4). 
(-gv 
In this case, the quotient ~ 
is a C-vector space of basis {7, 5, a: 2, Y} over C. Let 
F1

F3

F4

The ideal I(qo) possesses five syzygies. The coefficients of these syzygies are given by 
the columns of the matrix E :

Appendix B 
Then, each column Ej represents a relation between the fi. Using Macaulay and 
following the previous method, one establishes the equations in C[al,..., a16], which 
define H4(V) locally at %. The equations are : 
a4 
=

aT2a9 -- asarau -- a62 + a2a9 + aGall 
The parameters a4~ as, alo and a12 are explicit functions of the parameters ai, a2, aa, a5, 
a6, at, a9 and an. Therefore, (a) = (al, a2, a3, as, a6, aT, ag, an, a13, a14, a15, al~) con- 
stitutes a chart of H4(V) at %. 
t3.2 Local equations of H4(V) at a spherical quadruplet 
If now qo denotes the spherical quadruplet of support the point p of V, qo is defined by 
the ideal (x 2, xy, xz, y2, yz, z ~) where (x, y, z) is a local system of coordinates centered 
COv 
at p. Let qo = (fl,--., fG). The quotient ~ 
is in this case a C-vector space of basis 
{I, ~, Y, 7}. One considers a deformation F1,..., F6 of the generators fx,.. 9 f6 in the 
cobasis : 
F1 
= 
x 2 + alx + a2y + aaz + a4 
F2 
=

F6 
= 
z 2 + a21x + a22y + a23z + a24 
where the parameters ai are elements of C. The ideal I(qo) has eight linearly inde- 
pendent syzygies. The coefficients of these syzygies are given by the columns of the 
E =

Let (a) = (al,...,d4,...,ds,...,a]2,...,a]6 
.... ,a~o,...,a~4) (the notation dl means 
that a~ is omitted). 
From the first six equations, the parameters a4, as, al2, a16, a20 
and a24 are explicit functions of the other eighteen parameters _a. 
These eighteen 
other parameters _a are linked by the last fifteen quadratic equations. One checks that 
these fifteen equations are linearly independent. 
Therefore, these fifteen quadratic 
equations of C[a] constitute the local equations of H4(V) 
at qo. (Recall ([I2], [El) that 
the spherical quadruplets are the singular points of the Hilbert scheme H4(V).)
