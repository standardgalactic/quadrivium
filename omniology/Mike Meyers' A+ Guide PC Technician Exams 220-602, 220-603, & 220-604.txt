Scott Jernigan, my Editor-in-Chief, Counter-Strike Foe, Master Bard, and Bon
Vivant, was the glue that made this product happen. There’s not a word or pic-
ture I put into this book that he hasn’t molded and polished into perfection.
My acquisitions editor, Tim Green, did a fabulous job keeping me moti-
vated and excited about this project. Tim, you’re the poster child for “Cali-
fornians who can actually get along with loud, obnoxious Texans.” Let’s do
another one!
My in-house Graphics Guru and Brother Tech, Michael Smyer, took ev-
ery bizarre illustration idea I could toss at him and came back with exactly
what I needed. To top it off, his outstanding photographs appear on nearly
every page in this book. Great job, Michael!
Cindy Clayton’s title might be “Editor” but it should be “Go to Gal,” as
she was always there for any job we needed to get done.
Cary Dier and Brian Schwarz came in at the 11th hour to save our bacon
with copy edits and technical editing. Thanks, guys!
On the McGraw-Hill side, their crew worked with the diligence of
worker bees and the patience of saints to put this book together.
Laura Stone did it all this time, a true pleasure to work with as project
editor, copy editor, and frequent long-distance companion during many
late nights. Your words of encouragement and praise—and laughter at my
bad jokes—helped me finish this book with sanity and a smile. I could not
have asked for a better editor, Laura. Thanks!
Jenni Housh offered a quiet voice and helpful spirit as acquisitions coor-
dinator. I enjoyed our Monday meetings and am looking forward to the next
project.
My technical editor, Ed Jennings, kept a close eye on me throughout the
book and made great suggestions and corrections. Thanks for the excellent
work!
To the copy editors, page proofers, and layout folks—Lisa Theobald,
LeeAnn Pickrell, Andy Carroll, Andrea Fox, Paul Tyler, and the folks at
ITC—thank you! You did a marvelous job.
■To my wonderful
daughter, Emily—
even though you’re
far away, you’re always
in my thoughts.
I love you.

have a docking station or port
replicator so you don’t have to
plug in all of your peripheral
devices one at a time.
USB and FireWire
Universal serial bus (USB) and
FireWire (or more properly, IEEE
1394) are two technologies that have their roots in desktop computer tech-
nology, but have also found widespread use in portable PCs. Both types of
connections feature an easy-to-use connector and give the user the ability to
insert a device into a system while the PC is running—you won’t have to re-
boot a system in order to install a new peripheral. With USB and FireWire,
just plug the device in and go! Because portable PCs don’t have multiple in-
ternal expansion capabilities like desktops, USB and FireWire are two
of the more popular methods for attaching peripherals to laptops (see
Figure 19.16).
Port Replicators
A port replicator plugs into a single port on the portable computer— often a
USB port, but sometimes a proprietary port—and offers common PC ports,
such as serial, parallel, USB, network, and PS/2. By plugging the port
replicator into your notebook computer, you can instantly connect it to
non-portable components such as a printer, scanner, monitor, or a full-sized
keyboard. Port replicators are typically used at home or in the office with the
non-portable equipment already connected. Figure 19.17 shows an Dell
Inspiron laptop connected to a port replicator.
Once connected to the port replicator, the computer can access any de-
vices attached to it; there’s no need to connect each individual device to
the PC. As a side bonus, port replicators enable you to attach legacy de-
vices, such as parallel printers, to a new laptop that only has modern

Tech Tip
USB and Handheld
Computing Devices
Almost all PDAs and other
handheld devices—such as iPod
music players—connect to PCs
through USB ports. Most come
with a USB cable that has a stan-
dard connector on one end and a
proprietary connector on the
other. Don’t lose the cable!
Cross Check
USB and FireWire
You explored USB and FireWire back in Chapter 16, “Input/Output.”
What kind of connectors do USB and FireWire use? What cable length
limitations are there? How many devices can each support?
Although portable PCs most
often connect to port replicators
via USB ports, some manufac-
turers have proprietary connec-
tions for proprietary port
replicators. As long as such a
portable PC has a USB port, you
can use either the proprietary
hardware or the more flexible
USB devices.
 Installing and Configuring Video
Once you’ve decided on the features and price for your new video card or
monitor, you need to install them into your system. As long as you’ve got
the right connection to your video card, installing a monitor is straightfor-
ward. The challenge comes when installing
the video card.
During the physical installation of a
video card, watch out for two possible issues:
long cards and proximity of the nearest PCI
card. Some high-end video cards simply
won’t fit in certain cases or block access to
needed motherboard connectors such as the
IDE sockets. There’s no clean fix for such a
problem—you simply have to change at least
one of the components (video card, mother-
board, or case). Because high-end video
cards run very hot, you don’t want them sit-
ting right next to another card; make sure the
fan on the video card has plenty of ventila-
tion space. A good practice is to leave the slot
next to the video card empty to allow better
airflow (Figure 17.46).
Once you’ve properly installed the video
card and connected it to the monitor, you’ve
conquered half the territory for
making the video process work
properly. You’re ready to tackle
the drivers and tweak the operat-
ing system, so let’s go!
Software
Configuring your video software
is usually a two-step process. First
you need to load drivers for the
video card. Then you need to open
the Control Panel and go to the
Display applet to make your ad-
justments. Let’s explore how to
make the video card and monitor
work in Windows.
Drivers
Just like any other piece of hardware, your video card needs a driver to func-
tion. Video card drivers install pretty much the same way as all of the other
drivers we’ve discussed thus far: either the driver is already built into Win-
dows or you must use the installation CD that comes with the video card.
Video card makers are constantly updating their drivers. Odds are good
that any video card more than a few months old will have at least one

Install a Video Card
You know how to install an expansion card from your reading in earlier
chapters. Installing a video card is pretty much the same, so try this!
1. Refer back to Chapter 6, “Expansion Bus,” for steps on installing
a new card.
2. Plug the monitor cable into the video card port on the back of
the PC and power up the system. If your PC seems dead after
you install a video card, or if the screen is blank but you hear
fans whirring and the internal speaker sounding off long-short-
short-short, your video card likely did not get properly seated.
Unplug the PC and try again.

eSATA
External SATA (eSATA)
extends
the SATA bus to external devices,
as the name would imply. The
eSATA drives use similar connec-
tors to internal SATA, but they’re
keyed differently so you can’t mis-
take one for the other. Figure 9.27
shows eSATA connectors on the
back of a motherboard. eSATA uses
shielded cable lengths up to 2 me-
ters outside the PC and is hot
pluggable. The beauty of eSATA is
that it extends the SATA bus at full
speed, so you’re not limited to the
meager 50 or 60 MBps of FireWire
or USB.
 SCSI: Still Around
Many specialized server machines and enthusiasts’ systems use the small
computer system interface (SCSI) technologies for various pieces of core
hardware and peripherals, from hard drives to printers to high-end tape
backup machines. SCSI is different from ATA in that SCSI devices connect
together in a string of devices called a chain. Each device in the chain gets a
SCSI ID to distinguish it from other devices on the chain. Last, the ends of a
SCSI chain must be terminated. Let’s dive into SCSI now, and see how SCSI
chains, SCSI IDs, and termination all work.
SCSI is an old technology dating from the late 1970s, but it has been con-
tinually updated. SCSI is faster than ATA
(though the gap is closing fast), and until
SATA arrived SCSI was the only good
choice for anyone using RAID (see the
“RAID” section a little later). SCSI is ar-
guably fading away, but it still deserves
some mention.
SCSI Chains
SCSI manifests itself through a
SCSI
chain , a series of SCSI devices working
together through a host adapter. The host
adapter provides the interface between
the SCSI chain and the PC. Figure 9.28
shows a typical PCI host adapter. Many
techs refer to the host adapter as the SCSI
controller, so you should be comfortable
with both terms.

Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

PREFACE
I started writing computer books for the simple reason that no one wrote the
kind of books I wanted to read. The books were either too simple (Chapter 1,
“Using Your Mouse”) or too complex (Chapter 1, “TTL Logic and Transis-
tors”), and none of them provided a motivation for me to learn the informa-
tion. I believed that there were geeky readers just like me who wanted to
know why they needed to know the information in a computer book.
Good books motivate readers to learn what they are reading. For exam-
ple, if a book discusses binary arithmetic but doesn’t explain why I need to
learn it, that’s not a good book. Tell me that understanding binary makes it
easier to understand how a CPU works or why a megabyte is different from
a million bytes—then I get excited, no matter how geeky the topic. If I don’t
have a good motivation to do something, then I’m simply not going to do it
(which explains why I haven’t jumped out of an airplane!).
In this book, I teach you why you need to understand the technology
that runs almost every modern business. You’ll learn to build and fix com-
puters, exploring every nook and cranny, and master the art of the PC tech.
In the process, you’ll gain the knowledge you need to pass the CompTIA A+
220-602, 220-603, and 220-604 exams.
Enjoy, my fellow geek.

omputers have taken over the world, or at least many professions.
Everywhere you turn, a quick dig beneath the surface sawdust of
construction, the grease of auto mechanics, and the hum of medical technology
reveals one or more personal computers (PCs) working away, doing essential
jobs. Because the PC evolved from novelty item to essential science tool to
everyday object in a short period of time, there’s a huge demand for a workforce
that can build, maintain, troubleshoot, and repair PCs.

■The Importance of Skill in
Managing and Troubleshooting PCs
The people who work with computers—the information technology (IT)
workforce—do such varied jobs as design hardware, write computer pro-
grams that enable you to do specific jobs on the PC, and create small and
large groupings of computers— networks —that enable people to share
computer resources. IT people built the Internet, one of the most phenome-
nal inventions of the 20th century. IT people maintain the millions of com-
puters that make up the Internet. Computer technicians, or PC techs as
those of us in the field call each other, make up the core of the IT workforce.
Without the techs, none of the other stuff works. Getting workers with skill
in building, maintaining, troubleshooting, and fixing PCs is essential for
success for every modern business.
In the early days of the personal computer, anyone who used a PC had to
have skills as a PC tech. The PC was new, buggy, and prone to problems. You
didn’t want to rely on others to fix
your PC when the inevitable prob-
lems arose. Today’s PCs are much
more robust and have fewer prob-
lems, but they’re also much more
complex machines. Today’s IT in-
dustry, therefore, needs special-
ized workers who know how to
make the machines run well.
The Concept of
Certifications
Every profession requires special-
ized skills. For the most part, if you
want to get or keep a job that re-
quires those specialized skills, you
need some type of certification or
license. If you want a job fixing au-
tomobiles, for example, you get the
Automotive Service Excellence (ASE)
certification. If you want to per-
form companies’ financial audits,
you get your Certified Public Ac-
countant (CPA) certification.
Nearly every profession has
some criteria that you must meet to
show your competence and ability
to perform at a certain level. While
the way this works varies widely
from one profession to another, all

Six Degrees of Personal Computers
As a fun exercise, divide up your class or your study partners and try
this. One side comes up with a profession that seemingly doesn’t use or
depend on personal computers. The other side then, within six steps,
tries to knock that argument down. Here’s an example.
Side A: Poets don’t need computers.
Side B: Sure, the poet could handwrite his or her poetry, but
eventually would want the poems typewritten, thus a computer.
Side A counters: The poet could use an old-fashioned typewriter.
Side B: Okay, then to submit the poem for publication, the poet
would have to use the mail—the mail is sorted electronically by
computers.
Side A counters: The poet could hand-deliver the typed
manuscript.
Side B: To get into print, the poem would have to be made
electronically, whether by someone at the publisher’s typing it in
or even using a scanner to get it into electronic form.
Side A: Arghh!!!
You get the idea? Have fun and let your imagination run the game. By
the end of a few minutes, you’ll probably be convinced that computers
are indeed everywhere and involved in just about every aspect of
modern life.

of them will at some point make you take an exam or series of exams. Passing
these exams proves that you have the necessary skills to work at a certain
level in your profession, whether you’re an aspiring plumber, teacher, barber,
or lawyer.
If you successfully pass these exams, the organization that administers
those exams grants you certification. You receive some piece of paper or pin or
membership card that you can show to potential clients or employers. This cer-
tification gives those clients or employers a level of confidence that you can do
what you say you can do. Without this certification, either you will not find
suitable work in that profession or no one will trust you to do the work.
■The Importance of CompTIA
A+ Certification
Although microcomputers were introduced in the late 1970s, for many years
PC technicians did not have a universally recognized way to show clients or
employers that they know what to do under the hood of a personal computer.
Sure, there were vendor-specific certifications, but the only way to get them
was to get a job at an authorized warranty or repair facility first, and then get
the certification. Not that there’s anything wrong with vendor-specific training;
it’s just that no one manufacturer has taken enough market share to make IBM
training, for example, something that works for any job. (Then there is always
that little detail of getting the job first before you can get certified!)
The software/networking side of our business has not suffered from the
same lack of certifications. Due to the dominance of certain companies at
one time or another (for example, Microsoft and Novell), the vendor-spe-
cific certifications have provided a great way to get and keep a job. For ex-
ample, Microsoft’s Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE), Novell’s
Certified Novell Engineer (CNE), and Cisco’s Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert
(CCIE) have opened the doors for many.
But what about the person who runs around all day repairing printers,
repartitioning hard drives, upgrading device drivers, and building sys-
tems? What about the PC hobbyists who want to get paid for their skills?
What about the folks who, because they had the audacity to show that they
knew the difference between CMOS and a command prompt, find them-
selves with a new title like “PC Support Technician” or “Electronic Services
Specialist”? On the other hand, how about the worst title of them all: “The
Person Who Doesn’t Get a Nickel Extra but Who Fixes the Computers”?
CompTIA A+ certification fills that need.
What Is CompTIA A+ Certification?
CompTIA A+ certification is an industry-wide, vendor-neutral certification
program developed and sponsored by the Computing Technology Industry
Association (CompTIA) . The CompTIA A+ certification shows that you have a
basic competence in supporting microcomputers. You achieve this certification
by taking two computer-based, multiple-choice examinations. The tests cover
2
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

what technicians should know after nine months of full-time PC support ex-
perience. CompTIA A+ certification enjoys wide recognition throughout
the computer industry. To date, more than 600,000 technicians have become
CompTIA A+ certified, making it the most popular of all IT certifications.
Who Is CompTIA?
CompTIA is a nonprofit, industry trade association based in Oakbrook Ter-
race, Illinois. It consists of over 20,000 members in 102 countries. You’ll find
CompTIA offices in such diverse locales as Amsterdam, Dubai, Johannes-
burg, Tokyo, and São Paulo.
CompTIA provides a forum for people in these industries to network (as
in meeting people), represents the interests of its members to the govern-
ment, and provides certifications for many different aspects of the computer
industry. CompTIA sponsors A+, Network+, i-Net+, Security+, and other
certifications. CompTIA works hard to watch the IT industry and constantly
looks to provide new certifications to meet the ongoing demand from its
membership. Check out the CompTIA Web site at www.comptia.org for de-
tails on the other certifications that you can obtain from CompTIA.
Virtually every company of consequence in the IT industry is a member
of CompTIA. Here are a few of the biggies:
Adobe
Systems
AMD
Best Buy
Brother
International
Canon
Cisco Systems
CompUSA
Fujitsu
Gateway
Hewlett-Packard
IBM
Intel
Kyocera
McAfee
Microsoft
NCR
Novell
Panasonic
Sharp Electronics
Siemens
Symantec
Toshiba
Total Seminars, LLC
(that’s my company)
Plus many
thousands more!
CompTIA began offering CompTIA A+ certification back in 1993. When it
first debuted, the IT industry largely ignored CompTIA A+ certification. Since
that initial stutter, however, the CompTIA A+ certification has grown to be-
come the de facto requirement for entrance into the PC industry. Many compa-
nies require CompTIA A+ certification for all of their PC support technicians,
and the CompTIA A+ certification is widely recognized both in the United
States and internationally. Additionally, many other certifications recognize
CompTIA A+ certification and use it as credit toward their certifications.
The Path to Other Certifications
Most IT companies—big and small—see CompTIA A+ certification as the
entry point to IT. From CompTIA A+, you have a number of certification op-
tions, depending on whether you want to focus more on hardware and op-
erating systems, or move into network administration (although these
aren’t mutually exclusive goals). The following three certifications are
worth serious consideration:
■
CompTIA Network+ certification
■
Microsoft Certified Professional certifications
■
Cisco certifications
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the A+ Exams

CompTIA Network+ Certification
If you haven’t already taken the CompTIA Network+ certification exam,
make it your next certification. Just as CompTIA A+ certification shows you
have solid competency as a PC technician, CompTIA Network+ certification
demonstrates your skills as a network technician, including understanding
of network hardware, installation, and troubleshooting. CompTIA’s Net-
work+ certification is a natural step for continuing toward your Microsoft,
Novell, or Cisco certifications. Take the CompTIA Network+: it’s your
obvious next certification!
Microsoft Certified Professional Certifications
Microsoft operating systems control a huge portion of all installed net-
works, and those networks need qualified support people to make them
run. Microsoft’s series of certifications for networking professionals are a
natural next step after the CompTIA certifications. They offer a whole slew
of tracks and exams, but you should first pursue the Microsoft Certified Pro-
fessional (MCP) . The MCP is the easiest Microsoft certification to get, as it
only requires you to pass one of many different exams⎯and all of these ex-
ams count towards more advanced Microsoft certifications.
When it comes to advanced certifications, Microsoft’s ever-popular
Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) certification holds a lot of
clout in the job market. The MCSE consists of seven exams: six core exams
covering three study areas—client operating system, networking system,
and design—and one elective. You can find more details on Microsoft’s
training Web site at www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/default.asp.
Cisco Certifications
Let’s face it, Cisco routers pretty much run the Internet and most intranets in
the world. A router is a networking device that controls and directs the flow
of information over networks, such as e-mail messages, Web browsing, and
so on. Cisco provides three levels of certification for folks who want to show
their skills at handling Cisco products. Nearly everyone interested in Cisco
certification starts with the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) . The
CCNA can be yours for the price of only one completed exam, after which
you can happily slap the word Cisco on your resume! After your CCNA,
you should consider the Cisco Certified Networking Professional (CCNP)
certification. See the Cisco certification Web site here for more details:
www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/learning_career_certifications_and_
learning_paths_home.html.
■How Do I Become CompTIA
A+ Certified?
You become CompTIA A+ certified, in the simplest sense, by taking and
passing two computer-based, multiple-choice exams. No prerequisites are
required for taking the CompTIA A+ certification exams. There is no re-
quired training course, and there are no training materials to buy. You do
4
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

have to pay a testing fee for each of the two exams. You pay your testing
fees, go to a local testing center, and take the tests. You immediately know
whether you have passed or failed. By passing both exams, you become a
CompTIA A+ Certified Service Technician . There are no requirements for pro-
fessional experience. You do not have to go through an authorized training
center. There are no annual dues. There are no continuing education re-
quirements. You pass; you’re in. That’s it. Now for the details.
The Basic Exam Structure
CompTIA offers three tracks to CompTIA A+ certification: a primary (re-
ferred to as the IT Technician track) and two secondary (Help Desk and De-
pot Technician tracks). All three tracks require you to take two exams, the
first of which is called the CompTIA A+ Essentials .
The Essentials exam concentrates on understanding terminology and
technology, how to do fundamental tasks such as upgrading RAM, and ba-
sic Windows operating system support.
To follow the primary track, you would also take the
CompTIA A+
220-602 exam, called the “602” or “IT Technician exam.” The IT Technician
exam builds on the Essentials exam, concentrating on advanced configura-
tion and troubleshooting, including using the command line to accomplish
tech tasks. This exam also includes network and Internet configuration
questions.
To attain CompTIA A+ certification on one of the two secondary tracks,
you would take Essentials and follow with either the CompTIA A+ 220-603
exam (Help Desk Technician) or the CompTIA A+ 220-604 exam (Depot
Technician). Both exams test on a subset of the information covered in the IT
Technician exam, but go more in depth on some subjects and have less cov-
erage on other subjects. Nearly a third of all questions on the Help Desk
Technician exam ask about managing, configuring, and troubleshooting op-
erating systems, for example, whereas only one in five questions on the IT
Technician exam hits that subject.
All of the exams are extremely practical, with little or no interest in the-
ory. All questions are multiple choice or “click on the right part of the pic-
ture” questions. The following is an example of the type of question you will
see on the exams:
A dot-matrix printer is printing blank pages. Which item should you
check first?
A. Printer drivers
B. Platen
C. Print head
D. Ribbon
The correct answer is D, the ribbon. You can make an argument for any
of the others, but common sense (and skill as a PC technician) tells you to
check the simplest possibility first.
The 2006 tests use a regular test format, in which you answer a set num-
ber of questions and are scored based on how many correct answers you get,

Tech Tip
The Big Change in
CompTIA A+ Certification
In June of 2006, CompTIA an-
nounced the most comprehensive
changes to the CompTIA A+ certif-
ication exams. Up to this point, the
CompTIA A+ certification con-
sisted of two exams very different
from what we now use. CompTIA
gave these two exams a number of
different official names over the
years, but regardless of the name
they boiled down to what we called
the “hardware” exam and the “op-
erating system” exam. That split
always seemed forced because you
can’t have a functional computer
without both hardware and operat-
ing systems working together to get
things done.
In keeping with the idea of a PC
as a single system instead of the PC
as two separate entities—a pile of
hardware and a pile of software—
CompTIA reshaped the exams into
a basic, conceptual exam followed
by a more in-depth configuration/
maintenance/repair exam, for
which you have three choices. This
book will get you through the
220-602 IT Technician exam.

rather than the adaptive format used in recent years. These exams will have
no more than 100 questions each.
Be aware that CompTIA may add new questions to the exams at any time
to keep the content fresh. The subject matter covered by the exams won’t
change, but new questions may be added periodically at random intervals.
This policy puts stronger emphasis on understanding concepts and having
solid PC-tech knowledge rather than trying to memorize specific questions
and answers that may have been on the tests in the past. Going forward, no
book or Web resource will have all the “right answers” because those answers
will constantly change. Luckily for you, however, this book does not just
teach you what steps to follow in a particular case, but how to be a knowl-
edgeable tech who understands why you’re doing those steps, so that when
you encounter a new problem (or test question), you can work out the an-
swer. Not only will this help you pass the exams, you’ll be a better PC tech!
To keep up to date, we monitor the CompTIA A+ exams for new content
and update the special Tech Files section of the Total Seminars Web site
(www.totalsem.com) with new articles covering subjects we believe may
appear on future versions of the exams.
IT Technician (Exam 220-602)
The CompTIA A+ 220-602 exam covers the same eight domains, although
they’re weighted differently and emphasize different aspects of the tasks in-
volved. Table 1.1 lists the domains and percentages.
The IT Technician exam covers the same hardware and software as Es-
sentials, but with much more focus on determining the appropriate technol-
ogy for a situation—running diagnostics, and troubleshooting—rather than
identification of hardware or operating system utilities. The exam tests your
knowledge of computer components and programs so you can make in-
formed recommendations to customers. You need to understand how all the
technology should work, know the proper steps to figure out why
something doesn’t work, and then fix it.
The first domain, “Personal Computer Components,” provides a stark
example of the difference in focus between the exams. Essentials talks about

Tech Tip
Adaptive Exams
Even though the current
CompTIA A+ certification exams
use a regular, multiple-choice
exam format, CompTIA has in
the past used an adaptive format.
It’s worth your time to make sure
you know the difference between
the two types of exams. The main
difference between a regular exam
and an adaptive exam is that on
an adaptive exam, each question
is assigned a difficulty level (for
example, easy, medium, or diffi-
cult). When you answer a me-
dium question correctly, the exam
adapts and asks you a harder
question. If you miss one, the
exam adapts and asks an easier
question. There is a maximum
number of questions the test will
offer you, but not a set number of
questions against which you are
scored, like you’d find on a regu-
lar exam. To get a passing score
on an adaptive exam, you need to
answer enough difficult-level
questions to prove your mastery
of the material. Adaptive exams
need far fewer questions than reg-
ular exams before the test ends,
usually less than half the number
of questions. Another big differ-
ence is that you cannot go back
and check previous questions
within adaptive exams, so make
sure you have the answer you
want before you move on to the
next question!

identifying names, purposes, and characteristics of various devices. The IT
Technician exam, in contrast, goes into more depth: “Add, remove, and con-
figure personal computer components, including selection and installation of
appropriate components.” [Emphasis mine.]
“Laptops and Portable Devices” gives another great example. Domain 2.1
is the same for both exams, “Identify fundamental principles of using
laptops and portable devices.” Digging a little deeper into the domains
shows the differences. Essentials: “Identify names, purposes, and character-
istics of laptop-specific [devices such as] peripherals, expansion slots, [and]
communication devices.” IT Technician: “Identify appropriate applications
for laptop-specific communication connections such as Bluetooth, infrared,
cellular WAN, and Ethernet.” The former has you identify the technology;
the latter requires you to understand it in detail.
The two exams differ greatly in the “Operating Systems” domain. Es-
sentials tests you on standard installation, configuration, and diagnostic
tools, for example, but the IT Technician exam goes much deeper. You need
to understand intimately how to use the command line to manage the oper-
ating systems. You’re expected to know all sorts of disk structures and run
all the major disk management tools. Finally, the IT Technician exam grills
you on operating system recovery tools and techniques, so you can help
customers get back up and running quickly.
Help Desk Technician (Exam 220-603)
The CompTIA A+ 220-603 exam emphasizes skills you need to succeed as a
help desk technician, remotely helping people who run into problems on
their PCs. As such, you’ll be tested a lot more intensely on operating system
questions than you would be on the IT Technician exam. In fact, almost a
third of the questions cover OS diagnostic and troubleshooting problems.
Perhaps even more interesting is the coverage of “Communication and Pro-
fessionalism.” One out of every five questions is about the proper way to talk
with people, working to get the most information and being polite and
kind when speaking to angry and upset people. Table 1.2 lists the domains
and percentages.
Although the Help Desk exam removes mention of portable computers,
the percentages on the “Security” and “Safety and Environmental Issues”
domains go up a lot (from 8% and 5% to 15% for both). You’ve got to know
these topics very well to succeed on this exam.

Table 1.2
Exam 220-603 Domains and Percentages

A fundamental difference between the IT Technician and Help Desk
Technician exams is that the former covers installing devices in detail,
whereas the latter emphasizes troubleshooting even more. Of the two, the
Help Desk Technician exam is clearly the more difficult. You should go that
route only if your employer insists upon it!
Depot Technician (Exam 220-604)
The CompTIA A+ 220-604 exam is targeted at folks who work behind the
scenes fixing computers. These are the techs who don’t interact with cus-
tomers much, so the emphasis on this exam is hardware, hardware, and
even more hardware. If you can’t build, maintain, troubleshoot, and repair
any personal computer—desktop and portable—on the planet, this path is
not for you! Table 1.3 lists the domains and percentages.
A quick glance at the domain percentages tells the tale. Almost half of all
questions are on installing, configuring, optimizing, and upgrading PCs.
Although operating systems as a domain has been removed, you definitely
need to know a lot about them to install, configure, and troubleshoot de-
vices. “Laptop and Portable Devices” and “Printers and Scanners” domains
leap up to 40% of the exam questions. You’ll be grilled on fixing portables
and printers! Because the exam assumes you’ll be in a lab environment
rather than in an office space, security is de-emphasized. The presumed lack
of communication between tech and customer caused the “Communication
and Professionalism” objective to go completely away.
Help! Which Exam Should I Take?
With three different tracks to becoming a CompTIA A+ Certified Techni-
cian, the inevitable question revolves around choosing the proper track. The
bottom line is that unless you have an employer specifically telling you otherwise,
do the primary track. Take Essentials and follow that with the 220-602 IT
Technician exam. This is by far the more common track and the one the vast
majority of employers will want to see on your résumé! When you complete
a track, your test results will show which track you chose.
If you choose the primary IT Technician track, potential employers will
know they’re getting a properly well-rounded tech who can be thrown into
pretty much any IT situation and handle it well. The Help Desk and Depot
Technician tracks target very specific jobs, so unless that job is yours, com-
pleting one of these tracks—and not doing the IT Technician track—limits
your employment opportunities.

Exam 220-604 Domains and Percentages

A glance at the competencies for the three Technician exams (602, 603,
and 604) might suggest that it would be easier to take 603 or 604 because
they have fewer domains than 602, but that assumption could prove very
painful indeed. The Help Desk and Depot Technician exams test you on the
same material as the IT Technician exam, but emphasize different aspects or
different ways to tackle personal computer issues.
Help! What Chapters Cover the Help Desk
and Depot Technician Exams?
The Mike Meyers’ A+ Guide to Managing and Troubleshooting PCs teaches you
what you need to know to become a great tech, first and foremost. It just so
happens that by learning how to become a great tech, you learn enough to
pass the CompTIA A+ certification exams. Because the book focuses on tech
and not exclusively on certification, the sections covered under the IT Tech-
nician banner in each chapter pertain to all three advanced exams: 220-602,
220-603, and 220-604.
To pass the 603 or 604 exams, focus more time on chapters weighted
more heavily in the CompTIA domains for those exams. Table 1.4 shows the
full eight domains for Essentials and IT Technician exams, with a series
of check marks that tell you where to focus for which exam. The key is
pretty straightforward. One check means around 10% on the domains. Two
checks means ~20%, three checks ~30%, and so on.
How Do I Take the Exams?
Two companies,
Prometric
and
Pearson/VUE , administer the actual
CompTIA A+ testing. There are thousands of Prometric and Pearson/VUE
testing centers across the United States and Canada, and the rest of the world.

Where to Focus Your Study Time

You may take the exams at any testing center. Both Prometric and Pearson/
VUE offer complete listings online of all available testing centers. You can
select the closest training center and schedule your exams right from the
comfort of your favorite Web browser:
www.prometric.com
www.vue.com
Alternatively, in the United States and Canada, call Prometric at
800-776-4276 or Pearson/VUE at 877-551-PLUS (7587) to schedule the exams
and to locate the nearest testing center. International customers can find a list
of Prometric and Pearson/VUE international contact numbers for various re-
gions of the world on CompTIA’s Web site at www.comptia.org by selecting
the Find Your Test Center link on the CompTIA A+ certification page.
You must pay for the exam when you call to schedule. Be prepared to sit
on hold for a while. Have your Social Security number (or international
equivalent) and a credit card ready when you call. Both Prometric and
Pearson/VUE will be glad to invoice you, but you won’t be able to take the
exam until they receive full payment.
If you have special needs, both Prometric and Pearson/VUE will accom-
modate you, although this may limit your selection of testing locations.
How Much Does the Exam Cost?
The cost of the exam depends on whether you work for a CompTIA member
or not. At this writing, the cost for non-CompTIA members is $158 (U.S.) for
each exam. International prices vary, but you can check the CompTIA Web
site for international pricing. Of course, the prices are subject to change
without notice, so always check the CompTIA Web site for current pricing!
Very few people pay full price for the exam. Virtually every organiza-
tion that provides CompTIA A+ training and testing also offers discount
vouchers . You buy a discount voucher and then use the voucher number in-
stead of a credit card when you schedule the exam. Vouchers are sold per
exam, so you’ll need two vouchers for the two CompTIA A+ exams. Total
Seminars is one place to get discount vouchers. You can call Total Seminars
at 800-446-6004 or 281-922-4166, or get vouchers via the Web site: www
.totalsem.com. No one should ever pay full price for CompTIA A+ exams!
How to Pass the CompTIA A+ Exams
The single most important thing to remember about the CompTIA A+
certification exams is that CompTIA designed the exams to test the knowl-
edge of a technician with only nine months’ experience—so keep it simple!
The exams aren’t interested in your ability to overclock CAS timings in
CMOS or whether you can explain the exact difference between the Intel
975X Express and the NVIDIA nForce590 SLI chipsets. Don’t bother with a
lot of theory—think in terms of practical knowledge. Read the book, do
whatever works for you to memorize the key concepts and procedures, take
the practice exams on the CD in the back of the book, review any topics you
miss, and you should pass with no problem.

Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

Some of you may be in or just out of school, so studying for exams is
nothing novel. But if it’s been a while since you’ve had to study for and take
an exam, or if you think maybe you could use some tips, you may find the
next section valuable. It lays out a proven strategy for preparing to take and
pass the CompTIA A+ exams. Try it. It works.
Obligate Yourself
The very first step you should take is to schedule yourself for the exams.
Have you ever heard the old adage, “heat and pressure make diamonds”?
Well, if you don’t give yourself a little “heat,” you’ll end up procrastinating
and delay taking the exams, possibly forever! Do yourself a favor. Using the
information below, determine how much time you’ll need to study for the
exams, and then call Prometric or VUE and schedule them accordingly.
Knowing the exams are coming up makes it much easier to turn off the tele-
vision and crack open the book! You can schedule an exam as little as a few
weeks in advance, but if you schedule an exam and can’t take it at the sched-
uled time, you must reschedule at least a day in advance or you’ll lose your
money.
Set Aside the Right Amount of Study Time
After helping thousands of techs get their CompTIA A+ certification, we at
Total Seminars have developed a pretty good feel for the amount of study
time needed to pass the CompTIA A+ certification exams. Table 1.5 pro-
vides an estimate to help you plan how much study time you must commit
to the CompTIA A+ certification exams. Keep in mind that these are aver-
ages. If you’re not a great student or if you’re a little on the nervous side, add
10 percent; if you’re a fast learner or have a good bit of computer experience,
you may want to reduce the figures.
To use the table, just circle the values that are most accurate for you and
add them up to get your estimated total hours of study time.
To that value, add hours based on the number of months of direct, pro-
fessional experience you have had supporting PCs, as shown in Table 1.6.
A total neophyte usually needs around 200 hours of study time. An ex-
perienced tech shouldn’t need more than 40 hours.
Total hours for you to study: _____________.
A Strategy for Study
Now that you have a feel for how long it’s going to take, it’s time to develop a
study strategy. I’d like to suggest a strategy that has worked for others
who’ve come before you, whether they were experienced techs or total
newbies. This book is designed to accommodate the different study agendas
of these two different groups of students. The first group is experienced techs
who already have strong PC experience, but need to be sure they’re ready to
be tested on the specific subjects covered by the CompTIA A+ exams. The
second group is those with little or no background in the computer field.
These techs can benefit from a more detailed understanding of the history
and concepts that underlie modern PC technology, to help them remember
the specific subject matter information they must know for the exams.
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the A+ Exams
11
Those of you who just want
more knowledge in managing
and troubleshooting PCs can
follow the same strategy as
certification-seekers. Think in
practical terms and work with
the PC as you go through each
chapter.

I’ll use the shorthand terms Old Techs and New Techs for these two groups.
If you’re not sure which group you fall into, pick a few chapters and go
through some end-of-chapter questions. If you score less than 70%, go the
New Tech route.

Adding Up Your Study Time

I have broken most of the chapters into three distinct parts:
■
Essentials Review
A very quick review of topics from the 601
exam that you should know.
■
IT Technician
Topics that clearly fit under the CompTIA A+ IT
Technician exam domains.
■
Beyond A+
More advanced issues that probably will not be on the
CompTIA A+ exams—yet.
The beginning of each of these areas is clearly marked with a large ban-
ner that looks like this:
Essentials Review
Those of you who fall into the Old Tech group may want to proceed straight
to the IT Technician area in each chapter. After reading that section, jump
immediately to the questions at the end of the chapter. The end-of-chapter
questions concentrate on information in the IT Technician section. If you run
into problems, read the Essentials Review section in that chapter. Note that
you may need to skip back to previous chapters to get the review informa-
tion you need for later chapters.
After going through every chapter as described, Old Techs can move di-
rectly to testing their knowledge using the free practice exams on the
CD-ROM that accompanies the book. Once you start scoring in the 85 to
90 percent range, you’re ready to take the exams!
If you’re a New Tech or if you’re an Old Tech who wants the full learn-
ing experience this book can offer, start by reading the book, the whole book,
as though you were reading a novel, from page one to the end without skip-
ping around. Because so many computer terms and concepts build on each
other, skipping around greatly increases the odds you will become con-
fused and end up closing the book and firing up your favorite PC game.
Not that I have anything against PC games, but unfortunately that skill is
not useful for the CompTIA A+ exams!
Your goal on this first read is to understand concepts, the whys behind
the hows. It is very helpful to have a PC nearby as you read so you can stop
and inspect the PC to see a piece of hardware or how a particular concept
manifests in the real world. As you read about floppy drives, for example,
inspect the cables. Do they look like the ones in the book? Is there a variation?
Why? It is imperative that you understand why you are doing something,
not just how to do it on one particular system under one specific set of condi-
tions. Neither the exams nor real life as a PC tech works that way!
If you’re reading this book as part of a managing and troubleshooting
PCs class, rather than a certification-prep course, then I highly recommend
going the New Tech route, even if you have a decent amount of experience.
The book contains a lot of details that can trip you up if you focus only on the
test-specific sections of the chapters. Plus, your program might stress histor-
ical and conceptual knowledge as well as practical, hands-on skills.
The CompTIA A+ certification exams assume that you have basic user
skills. The exams really try to trick you with questions on processes that you
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the A+ Exams

three sections!

may do every day and not really think about. Here’s a classic: “In order to
move a file from the C:\WINDOWS folder to the A:\ drive using Windows
Explorer, what key must you hold down while dragging the file?” If you can
answer that without going to your keyboard and trying a few likely keys,
you’re better than most techs! In the real world, you can try a few wrong an-
swers before you hit on the right one, but for the exams, you have to know it!
Whether Old Tech or New Tech, make sure you are proficient at user-level
Windows skills, including the following:
■
Recognizing all the components of the standard Windows desktop
(Start Menu, System Tray, etc.)
■
Manipulating windows—resizing, moving, and so on
■
Creating, deleting, renaming, moving, and copying files and folders
within Windows
■
Understanding file extensions and their relationship with program
associations
■
Using common keyboard shortcuts/hotkeys
Any PC technician who has been around a while will tell you that one of
the great secrets in the computer business is that there’s almost never any-
thing completely new in the world of computer technology. Faster, cleverer,
smaller, wider—absolutely—but the underlying technology, the core of what
makes your PC and its various peripheral devices operate, has changed re-
markably little since PCs came into widespread use a few decades ago.
After you’ve completed the first read-through, go through the book
again, this time in textbook mode. If you’re an Old Tech, this is where you
start your studying. Try to cover one chapter at a sitting. Concentrate on the
IT Technician sections. Get a highlighter and mark the phrases and sen-
tences that bring out major points. Be sure you understand how the pictures
and illustrations relate to the concepts being discussed.

Try This!
Windows Vista
Microsoft’s Windows Vista operating system debuted in January 2007,
and although CompTIA won’t immediately put it on the CompTIA A+
certification exams, every tech will need to know it. Do yourself and your
customers a favor and work with Windows Vista as soon as you can after
you finish getting CompTIA A+ certified, even if it means using a school
computer or making a lot of trips to computer stores.
I suggest waiting only because you’ll want to keep the details of
how to do things in Windows 2000 and Windows XP as fresh as possible
before you take the exams. If you’re studying simply to gain knowledge
and are not worried about getting certified, then jump right in!
Once you have access to a Windows Vista computer, skim through
this book and ask yourself these questions. What’s different about set-
ting up drives? What about installation? What diagnostic and trouble-
shooting tools does Vista offer that you can’t find or that differ
significantly from tools in Windows 2000 or Windows XP?

Once you feel you have a good grasp of the material in the book, you can
check your knowledge using the practice exams included on the CD-ROM
in the back of the book. These can be taken in Practice mode or Final mode.
In Practice mode, you can use the Assistance window to get a helpful hint
for the current questions, find the chapter that covers the question using the
Reference feature, check your answer for the question, and see an explana-
tion of the correct answer. In Final mode, you answer all the questions and
are given an exam score at the end, just like the real thing.
Both modes show you an overall grade, expressed as a percentage, as
well as a breakdown of how well you did on each exam domain. The Review
Questions feature lets you see what questions you missed and what the cor-
rect answers are. Use these results to guide further studying. Continue re-
viewing the topics you miss and taking additional exams until you are
consistently scoring in the 85% to 95% range. When you get there, you are
ready to pass the CompTIA A+ certification exams!

Tech Tip
Study Strategies
Perhaps it’s been a while since
you had to study for a test. Or
perhaps it hasn’t, but you’ve done
your best since then to block the
whole experience from your
mind! Either way, savvy test-
takers know there are certain
techniques that make studying for
tests more efficient and effective.
Here’s a trick used by students
in law and medical schools who
have to memorize reams of infor-
mation: write it down. The act of
writing something down (not
typing, writing) in and of itself
helps you to remember it, even if
you never look at what you wrote
again. Try taking separate notes
on the material and recreating di-
agrams by hand to help solidify
the information in your mind.
Another oldie but goodie: make
yourself flash cards with ques-
tions and answers on topics you
find difficult. A third trick: take
your notes to bed and read them
just before you go to sleep. Many
people find they really do learn
while they sleep!

Chapter 1 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
the CompTIA A+ exams.
The Importance of Skill in Managing
and Troubleshooting PCs
■
The IT workforce designs, builds, and maintains
computers, computer programs, and networks, the
basic information tools of the early 21st century.
PC techs take care of personal computers, so they
represent an essential component in that workforce.
As PCs become more complex, the IT workforce
needs specialized PC techs.
■
Certifications prove to employers that you have the
necessary skill to work in your chosen field. If you
want a job fixing automobiles, for example, you get
the Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) certification.
To get certified, you take and successfully pass
exams. Then the organization that administers
those exams grants you certification. This is
particularly important for IT workers.
The Importance of CompTIA A+ Certification
■
In the early days of the personal computer, you
could get vendor-specific certifications such as
“IBM Technician,” but nothing general for PC
techs. Worse, you often had to have a job at that
company to get the vendor-specific certification.
■
CompTIA A+ certification is an industry-wide,
vendor-neutral certification program that shows
that you have a basic competence in supporting
microcomputers. You achieve this certification by
taking two computer-based, multiple-choice
examinations. The tests cover what technicians
should know after nine months of full-time PC
support experience. CompTIA A+ certification
enjoys wide recognition throughout the computer
industry.
■
CompTIA is a nonprofit, industry trade association
based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. It consists of
over 20,000 members in 102 countries. CompTIA
provides a forum for people in these industries to
network, represents the interests of its members to
the government, and provides certifications for
many different aspects of the computer industry.
CompTIA sponsors A+, Network+, i-Net+,
Security+, and other certifications.
■
The CompTIA A+ certification is the de facto entry
point to IT. From CompTIA A+, you have a
number of certification options, depending on
whether you want to focus more on hardware and
operating systems, or move into network
administration. You can get CompTIA Network+
certification, for example, or go on to get Microsoft
or Cisco certified. CompTIA Network+ certification
is the most obvious certification to get after
becoming CompTIA A+ certified.
How to Become CompTIA A+ Certified
■
You become CompTIA A+ certified, in the simplest
sense, by taking and passing two computer-based,
multiple-choice exams. No prerequisites are
required for taking the CompTIA A+ certification
exams. There is no required training course, and
there are no training materials to buy. You do have
to pay a testing fee for each of the two exams.
■
CompTIA offers three tracks to CompTIA A+
certification, a primary (referred to as the IT
Technician track) and two secondary (Help Desk
and Depot Technician tracks). All three tracks
require you to take two exams, the first of which is
called the CompTIA A+ Essentials. The Essentials
exam concentrates on understanding terminology
and technology, how to do fundamental tasks such
as upgrading RAM, and basic Windows operating
system support. The IT Technician exam builds on
the Essentials exam, concentrating on advanced
configuration and troubleshooting.
■
To attain CompTIA A+ certification on one of the
two secondary tracks, you would take Essentials
and follow with either the CompTIA 220-603 exam
(Help Desk Technician) or the CompTIA 220-604
exam (Depot Technician). Both exams test on a
subset of the information covered in the IT
Technician exam, but go more in depth on some
subjects and have less coverage on other subjects.

■
All of the exams are extremely practical, with little
or no interest in theory. All questions are multiple
choice or “click on the right part of the picture”
questions. CompTIA may add new questions to the
exams at any time to keep the content fresh,
although the subject matter covered by the exams
won’t change.
■
Of the three tracks to becoming a CompTIA A+
Certified Technician, most techs take the Essentials
plus 220-602, IT Technician. Take one of the
secondary tracks only if an employer specifically
requires it.
■
Two companies, Prometric and Pearson/VUE,
administer the actual CompTIA A+ testing. You
can schedule exam time and location via the Web
site for either company, www.prometric.com or
www.vue.com. Check CompTIA’s Web site for
international links.
■
To achieve success with the CompTIA A+
certification exams, think in terms of practical
knowledge. Read the book. Work through the
problems. Work with computers. Take the practice
exams. You should obligate yourself by scheduling
your exams. This keeps you focused on study.

■Installing CPUs
Installing or replacing a CPU is a remarkably straightforward process. You
take off the fan and heat sink assembly, remove the CPU, put a new CPU in,
and snap the fan and heat sink assembly back on. The trick to installing or
replacing a CPU begins with two important questions. Do you need to re-
place your CPU? What CPU can you put in the computer?
Why Replace a CPU?
The CPU is the brain of your system, so it seems a natural assumption that
taking out an old, slow CPU and replacing it with some new, fast CPU
would make your computer run faster. No doubt it will, but before you do
you need to consider a few issues, such as cost, cooling, and performance.
Cost
If you have an older CPU, there’s a better than average chance that a faster
version of your CPU is no longer available for retail purchase. In that case,
replacing your CPU with a new one would require you to replace the moth-
erboard and probably the RAM too. This is doable, but does it make sense
cost-wise? How much would this upgrade compare to a whole new system?
20
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

Cooling
Faster CPUs run hotter than slower ones. If you get a new CPU, you will al-
most certainly need a new fan to dissipate the heat generated by the more
powerful processor. In addition, you may discover your case fans are not
sufficient, causing the CPU to overheat and making the system lock up.
Adding improved cooling can be done, but it might require a new case.
Performance
A faster CPU will make your computer run faster, but by how much? The re-
sults are often disappointing. As you go through this book, you will dis-
cover many other areas where upgrading might make a much stronger
impact on your system’s performance.
Determining the Right CPU
So you go through all the decision-making and de-
cide to go for a new CPU. Perhaps you’re building a
brand-new system or maybe you’re ready to go for
that CPU upgrade. The single most important bit
of documentation is called the motherboard book
(Figure 2.1). Every computer should come with this
important book, which contains all the details about
what CPUs you can use as well as any special con-
siderations for installing a CPU. Usually in the
first few pages, the motherboard book will tell you
exactly which CPUs your system can handle (as
shown in Figure 2.2).
If you don’t have a motherboard book, call the
place where you got the PC and ask for it. If they
don’t have it, get online and find it⎯I’ll show you
where to look in later chapters.
Your first concern is the socket. You can’t install
an Athlon 64 X2 into a Pentium D’s Socket 775—it won’t fit! If your mother-
board book lists the CPU you want to install, you’re ready to start shopping.
Chapter 2: Installing and Troubleshooting CPUs

Buying a CPU
Buying a CPU is a tricky game because most stores will not accept returns
unless the CPU is bad. If you’re not careful, you could get stuck with a use-
less CPU. Here are a few tricks.
CPUs come packaged two ways, as retail-boxed CPUs or OEM CPUs.
Retail-boxed CPUs have two advantages. First, they are the genuine article.
There are a surprising number of illegal CPUs on the market. Second, they
come with a fan that is rated to work with that CPU.
Most stores have an installation deal and will install a new CPU for very
cheap. I will take advantage of this sometimes, even though it may mean I
don’t have my PC for a few days. Why does your humble author, the Alpha
Geek, have others do work he can do himself? Well, that way I’m not out of
luck if there is a problem! Heck, I can change my own oil in my car, but I let
others do that, too!
If you buy an OEM CPU, you will need the right fan. See “The Art of
Cooling” section later in this chapter.
Preparing to Install
Once you’re comfortable that your new CPU will work with your mother-
board, get back to that motherboard book and see if there are any tiny jump-
ers or switches that you must adjust for your CPU. These jumpers might
adjust the motherboard speed, the multiplier, or the voltage. Take your
time, read the motherboard book, and set those jumpers or switches prop-
erly. Locate the fan power connector, usually called the CPU fan, as shown
in Figure 2.3.
Most CPUs use some form of mounting bracket for the CPU fan. Some of
these brackets require mounting underneath the motherboard, which
means removing the motherboard from the system case.
If you’re removing an old CPU, you’ll need to take off the old fan. Re-
moving CPU fans scares me more than any other physical act I do on a PC.
Many (not all) CPU fans use a metal clamp on both sides of the socket. These
clamps usually require you to pry them off to remove them using a flat-head
22
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
Many motherboards have no
jumpers or switches.
Before attempting to do any-
thing inside the system unit,
make sure you have adequate
ESD protection. Make sure the
power is off and the system is
unplugged.
• Figure 2.3
Fan connection

screwdriver (Figure 2.4). You need a lot of force⎯usually far more than you
think you should use, so take your time and pry that old fan off!
Inserting a PGA-Type CPU
Inserting and removing pin grid array (PGA) CPUs is a relatively simple pro-
cess; just don’t touch the pins or you might destroy the CPU. Figure 2.5 shows
a technician installing a Sempron into a Socket 754. Note the pins on the
CPU only fit in one orientation. These orientation markers are designed to
help you align the CPU correctly. Although the orientation marks make it
very difficult to install a CPU improperly, incorrectly installing your CPU
will almost certainly destroy the CPU or the mother-
board, or both!
To install, lift the zero insertion force (ZIF) socket
arm or open the metal cover, align the CPU, and it
should drop right in (Figure 2.6). If it doesn’t, verify
your alignment and check for bent pins on the CPU.
If you encounter a slightly bent pin, try a mechanical
pencil that takes thick (0.9mm) lead. Take the lead
out of the mechanical pencil, slide the pencil tip over
the bent pin, and straighten it out. Be careful! A bro-
ken CPU pin ruins the CPU. Make sure the CPU is
all the way in (no visible pins) and then snap down
the arm or drop over the metal cover.
Now it’s time for the fan! Before inserting the fan,
you need to add a small amount of thermal com-
pound (also called heat dope ). Many fans come with
thermal compound already on them; the thermal
compound on these pre-doped fans is covered by a
small square of tape—take it off before you snap
down the fan. If you need to put thermal compound
Chapter 2: Installing and Troubleshooting CPUs
23
It’s a good idea to use a new
fan when you replace a CPU—
even if the old fan works with
your new CPU. Fans get old and
die, too!
• Figure 2.4
Removing an old fan
• Figure 2.5
Orienting the CPU

on from a tube (see Figure 2.7), know that it only takes a tiny amount of this
compound! Spread it on as thinly, completely, and evenly as you can. Un-
like so many other things in life, you can have too much thermal compound!
Securing fans makes even the most jaded PC technician a little nervous
(Figure 2.8). In most cases, you must apply a fairly strong amount of force to
snap the fan into place—far more than you might think. Also, make certain
that the fan you install works with your CPU package.
Testing Your New CPU
The next step is to turn on the PC and see if the system boots up. If life were
perfect, every CPU installation would end right here as you watch the sys-
tem happily boot up. Unfortunately, the reality is that sometimes
nothing happens when you press the On button. Here’s what to
do if this happens.
First, make sure the system has power—we’ll be going through
lots of power issues throughout the book. Second, make sure the
CPU is firmly pressed down into the socket. Get your head down
and look at the mounted CPU from the side—do you see any of the
CPU’s wires showing? Does the CPU look level in its mount? If not,
reinstall the CPU. If the system still does not boot, double-check any
jumper settings—it’s very easy to mess them up.
As the computer starts, make sure the CPU fan is spinning
within a few seconds. If it doesn’t spin up instantly, that’s okay,
but it must start within about 30 seconds at the least.
The Art of Cooling
There once was a time long ago when CPUs didn’t need any type
of cooling device. You just snapped in the CPU and it worked.

Installing the fan

Well, those days are gone. Long gone. If you’re installing a modern CPU,
you will have to cool it. Fortunately, you have choices.
■
OEM Fans
OEM fans are included with a retail-boxed CPU. OEM
CPUs, on the other hand, don’t normally come bundled with fans.
Crazy, isn’t it? OEM fans have one big advantage: you know
absolutely that they will work with your CPU.
■
Specialized Fans
Lots of companies sell third-party fans for
different CPUs. These usually exceed the OEM fans in the amount of
heat they dissipate. These fans invariably come with eye-catching
designs to look really cool inside your system—some are even
lighted! (See Figure 2.9.)
The last choice is the most impressive of all— liquid cooling ! That’s
right, you can put a little liquid cooling system right inside your PC case!
Liquid cooling works by running some liquid—usually water—through a
metal block that sits on top of your CPU, absorbing heat. The liquid gets
heated by the block, runs out of the block and into something that cools the
liquid, and the liquid is then pumped through the block again. Any liquid
cooling system consists of three main parts:
■
A hollow metal block that sits on the CPU
■
A pump to move the liquid around
■
Some device to cool the liquid
And, of course, you need plenty of hosing to hook them all together!
Figure 2.10 shows a typical liquid-cooled CPU.
A number of companies sell these liquid-cooling systems. Although
they look really impressive and certainly cool your CPU, the reality is that
unless you’re overclocking or want a quiet system, a good fan will more
than suffice.

Whether you have a silent or noisy cooling system for your CPU, always
remember to keep everything clean. Once a month or so, take a can of com-
pressed air and clean dust off the fan or radiator. CPUs are very susceptible
to heat; a poorly working fan can create all sorts of problems, such as system
lockups, spontaneous reboots, and more.
Beyond A+
Overclocking
For the CPU to work, it must have the motherboard speed, multiplier, and
voltage set properly. In most modern systems, the motherboard uses the
CPUID functions to set these options automatically. Some motherboards en-
able you to adjust these settings manually by moving a jumper, changing a
CMOS setting, or with software; many enthusiasts deliberately change
these settings to enhance performance.
Starting way back in the days of the Intel 80486 CPU, people intention-
ally ran their systems at clock speeds higher than the CPU was rated, a pro-
cess called overclocking , and they worked. Well, sometimes the systems
worked, and sometimes they didn’t. Intel and AMD have a reason for mark-
ing a CPU at a particular clock speed—that’s the highest speed they guaran-
tee will work.
Before I say anything else, I must warn you that intentional overclocking
of a CPU immediately voids any warranty. Overclocking has been known
to destroy CPUs. Overclocking might make your system unstable and prone
to lockups and reboots. I neither applaud nor decry the practice of
overclocking. My goal here is simply to inform you of the practice. You
make your own decisions.
CPU makers dislike overclocking. Why would you pay more for a faster
processor when you can take a cheaper, slower CPU and just make it run
faster? To that end, CPU makers, especially Intel, have gone to great lengths
to discourage the practice. For example, both AMD and Intel now make all
their CPUs with locked multipliers and special overspeed electronics to de-
ter the practice.
I don’t think Intel or AMD really care too much what end users do with
their CPUs. You own it; you take the risks. A number of criminals, however,
learned to make a good business of remarking CPUs with higher than rated
speeds and selling them as legitimate CPUs. These counterfeit CPUs have
created a nightmare where unsuspecting retailers and end users have been
given overclocked CPUs. When they run into trouble, they innocently ask
for warranty support, only to discover that their CPU is counterfeit and the
warranty is void.
If you want to know exactly what type of CPU you’re running, down-
load a copy of the very popular and free CPU-Z utility from www.cpuid.
com. CPU-Z gives you every piece of information you’ll ever want to know
about your CPU (Figure 2.11).
Most people make a couple of adjustments to overclock successfully.
First, through jumpers, CMOS settings, or software configuration, increase

CPUs are thermally sensitive
devices—keep those fans clean!

the bus speed for the system. Second, you often have to
increase the voltage going into the CPU by just a little to
provide stability. You do that by changing a jumper or
CMOS setting.
Overriding the defaults can completely lock up
your system, to the point where even removing and re-
installing the CPU doesn’t bring the motherboard back
to life. (There’s also a slight risk of toasting the proces-
sor, although all modern processors have circuitry that
shuts them down quickly before they overheat.) Most
motherboards have a jumper setting called CMOS clear
(Figure 2.12) that makes the CMOS go back to default
settings. Before you try overclocking on a modern sys-
tem, find the CMOS clear jumper and make sure you
know how to use it! Hint: Look in the motherboard
manual.

Chapter 2 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
installing and troubleshooting CPUs.
Installing CPUs
■
Before upgrading your CPU, consider the
implications on your whole system, because an
upgraded CPU may require an updated
motherboard and RAM.
■
Consult your motherboard documentation to see
what CPUs are compatible with your system. Not
all CPUs are compatible with all motherboards.
■
Cooling is critical. Make sure you have a fan rated
to work with your CPU.
■
Never touch the pins on the underside of a CPU, as
this can permanently damage the processor.
■
A PGA CPU fits only one way in the ZIF socket.
Don’t force it. If you find the CPU will not
seat properly, take a second look at the
orientation markers and verify the CPU is in
the correct direction. Check the pins on the
underside to make sure none are bent.
■
There should be a small amount of heat sink
compound between the CPU and heat sink/fan
assembly. If your fan came with the compound
already applied, be sure to remove the protective
tape covering the compound before attaching the
fan to the CPU. If you are using your own heat
dope from a tube, spread it thinly and evenly.
CPU Cooling
■
OEM fans are included with a retail-boxed CPU.
Specialty fans, sold by third-party vendors,
typically exceed the OEM fans in performance.
■
Liquid cooling involves running liquid through
a metal block on top of the CPU. In addition to the
metal block, liquid cooling systems include a
pump to move the liquid, a device to cool the
liquid, and a hose to distribute the liquid.

nstalling RAM is easy to do and very forgiving of mistakes, making it the most
common upgrade for PCs. Although the physical act of snapping in RAM is
simple, there are a number of tricks to ensure the RAM you buy works when
you do put it in a machine. This chapter covers what you need to know about
choosing the right type of RAM, installing RAM in a PC, and troubleshooting

■Working with RAM
Whenever someone comes up to me and asks what single hardware up-
grade they can do to improve their system performance, I always tell them
the same thing—add more RAM. Adding more RAM can improve overall
system performance, processing speed, and stability—if you get it right.
Botching the job can cause dramatic system instability, such as frequent,
random crashes and reboots. Every tech needs to know how to install and
upgrade system RAM of all types.
To get the desired results from a RAM upgrade,
you must first determine if insufficient RAM is the
cause of system problems. Second, you need to pick
the proper RAM for the system. Finally, you must use
good installation practices. Always store RAM sticks
in anti-static packaging whenever they’re not in use,
and use strict ESD handling procedures. Like many
other pieces of the PC, RAM is very sensitive to ESD
and other technician abuse (Figure 3.1)!
Do You Need RAM?
Two symptoms point to the need for more RAM in a PC:
general system sluggishness and excessive hard drive
accessing. If programs take forever to load and running
programs seem to stall and move more slowly than you

would like, the problem could stem
from insufficient RAM. A friend
with a new Windows XP Profes-
sional system complained that her
PC seemed snappy when she first
got it, but takes a long time to do the
things she wants to do with it, such
as photograph retouching in Adobe
Photoshop and document layout
for a print zine she produces. Her
system had only 256 MB of RAM,
sufficient to run Windows XP Pro-
fessional, but woefully insufficient
for her tasks—she kept maxing out
the RAM and thus the system
slowed to a crawl. I replaced her
stick with a pair of 1-GB sticks and
suddenly she had the powerhouse
workstation she desired.
Excessive hard drive activity when you move between programs points
to a need for more RAM. Every Windows PC has the capability to make a
portion of your hard drive look like RAM in case you run out of real RAM.
This is called the
page file
or swap file. If you fill your RAM up with
programs, your PC will automatically start loading some programs into the
page file. You can’t see this process taking place just by looking at the screen—
these swaps are done in the background. But you will notice the hard drive ac-
cess LED going crazy as Windows rushes to move programs between RAM
and the page file in a process called disk thrashing . Windows uses the page
file all the time, but excessive disk thrashing suggests that you need more
RAM.
You can diagnose excessive disk thrashing through simply observing
the hard drive access LED flashing, or through various third-party tools. I
like FreeMeter (www.tiler.com/freemeter/). It’s been around for quite a
while, runs on all versions of Windows, and is easy to use (Figure 3.2). No-
tice on the FreeMeter screenshot that some amount of the page file is being
used. That’s perfectly normal.
System RAM Recommendations
Microsoft sets the minimum RAM requirements listed for the various Win-
dows operating systems very low to get the maximum number of users to up-
grade or convert, and that’s fine. A Windows XP Professional machine will run
on 64 MB of RAM. Just don’t ask it to do any serious computing, like run Doom
III! Here are my recommendations for system RAM.

Checking the Page File
How much of your hard drive does Windows use for a page file? Does
the level change dramatically when you open typical applications, such
as Microsoft Word, Solitaire, and Paint Shop Pro? The answers to these
questions can give a tech a quick estimation about RAM usage and pos-
sibly RAM needs for a particular system, so try this.
Windows 2000/XP gives you a very easy way to glance at your page
file usage through the Task Manager. To access the Task Manager, press
CTRL-ALT-DEL simultaneously once. Click the Performance tab. The sec-
ond box on the left, titled PF Usage, displays the amount of hard drive
the page file is currently using.

How big is the page file when you have no applications open?

How much does it change when you open applications?

Determining Current RAM Capacity
Before you go get RAM, you obviously need to know how much RAM you
currently have in your PC. Every version of Windows works the same way.
Just select the Properties for My Computer to see how much RAM is in your
system (Figure 3.3). If you have a newer keyboard, you can access the screen
with the WINDOWS-PAUSE/BREAK keystroke combination. Windows 2000
and XP come with the handy Performance tab under the Task Manager (as
shown in Figure 3.4).

Getting the Right RAM
To do the perfect RAM upgrade, determine the optimum capacity of RAM
to install and then get the right RAM for the motherboard. Your first two
stops toward these goals are the inside of the case and your motherboard
manual. Open the case to see how many sticks of RAM you have installed
currently and how many free slots you have open. Check the motherboard
book to determine the total capacity of RAM the system can handle and
what specific technology works with your system. You can’t put DDR
SDRAM into a system that can only handle SDR SDRAM, after all, and it
won’t do you much good to install a pair of 512-MB DIMMs when your sys-
tem tops out at 784 MB! Figure 3.5 shows the RAM limits for my Gigabyte
motherboard.
Mix and Match at Your Peril
All motherboards can handle different capacities of RAM. If you have three
slots, you may put a 512-MB stick in one and a 1-GB stick in the other with a
high chance of success. To ensure maximum stability in a system, however,
shoot for as close as you can get to uniformity of RAM. Choose RAM sticks
that match in technology, capacity, and speed. Even on motherboards that
offer slots for radically different RAM types, I recommend uniformity.
Chapter 3: Installing and Troubleshooting RAM
35
Tech Tip
CPU-Z
The freeware CPU-Z program will
tell you the total number of slots on
your motherboard, the number of
slots used, and the exact type of
RAM in each slot—very handy.
CPU-Z not only determines the
latency of your RAM, but also lists
the latency at a variety of mother-
board speeds. The CD accompany-
ing this book has a copy of CPU-Z,
so check it out!
• Figure 3.5
The motherboard book shows how much RAM that Athlon 64 can handle.

Mixing Speeds
With so many different DRAM speeds available, you may often find your-
self tempted to mix speeds of DRAM in the same system. Although in many
situations you can get away with mixing speeds on a system, the safest, easi-
est rule to follow is to use the speed of DRAM specified in the motherboard
book, and make sure that every piece of DRAM runs at that speed. In a
worst-case scenario, mixing DRAM speeds can cause the system to lock up
every few seconds or every few minutes. You might also get some data cor-
ruption. Mixing speeds sometimes works fine, but don’t do your income tax
on a machine with mixed DRAM speeds until the system has proven to be
stable for a few days. The important thing to note here is that you won’t
break anything, other than possibly data, by experimenting.
Okay, I have mentioned enough disclaimers. Modern motherboards
provide some flexibility regarding RAM speeds and mixing. First, you can
use RAM that is faster than what the motherboard specifies. For example, if
the system needs PC3200 DDR2 SDRAM, you may put in PC4200 DDR2
SDRAM and it should work fine. Faster DRAM is not going to make the sys-
tem run any faster, however, so don’t look for any system improvement.
Second, you can sometimes get away with putting one speed of DRAM
in one bank and another speed in another bank, as long as all the speeds are
as fast or faster than the speed specified by the motherboard. Don’t bother
trying to put different-speed DRAMs in the same bank with a motherboard
that uses dual-channel DDR. Yes, it works once in a while, but it’s too
chancy. I avoid it.
Installing DIMMs and RIMMs
Installing DRAM is so easy that it’s one of the very few jobs I recommend to
non-techie folks. First, attach an anti-static wrist strap or touch some bare
metal on the power supply to ground yourself and avoid ESD. Then swing
the side tabs on the RAM slots down from the upright position. Pick up a
stick of RAM—don’t touch those contacts! A
good hard push down is usually all you need to
ensure a solid connection. Make sure that the
DIMM snaps into position to show it is com-
pletely seated. You will also notice that the two
side tabs will move in to reflect a tight connection
(Figure 3.6).
SPD
Your motherboard should detect and automati-
cally set up any DIMM or RIMM you install,
assuming you have the right RAM for the system.
RAM makers add a handy chip to modern sticks
called the
serial presence detect (SPD) chip
(Figure 3.7). The SPD stores all the information
about your DRAM, including size, speed, ECC or
non-ECC, registered or unregistered, and a num-
ber of other more technical bits of information.
36
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
• Figure 3.6
Inserting a DIMM

When a PC boots, it queries the SPD so that the MCC knows how
much RAM is on the stick, how fast it runs, and other information.
Any program can query the SPD. Take a look at Figure 3.8 with the re-
sults of the popular CPU-Z program showing RAM information from
the SPD.
All new systems count on the SPD to set the RAM timings prop-
erly for your system when it boots. If you add a RAM stick with a bad
SPD, you’ll get a POST error message and the system will not boot.
You can’t fix a broken SPD; you just buy a new stick of RAM.
The RAM Count
After installing the new RAM, turn on the PC and watch the boot pro-
cess closely. If you installed the RAM correctly, the RAM count on the
PC will reflect the new value. If the RAM value stays the same, you
probably have installed the RAM in a slot the motherboard doesn’t
want you to use (for example, if you need to use a particular slot first)
or the RAM is not properly installed. If the computer does not boot
and you’ve got a blank screen, you probably have not installed all the
RAM sticks correctly. Usually, a good second look is all you need
to determine the problem (Figures 3.9 and 3.10). Reseat or reinstall
the RAM stick and try again.
RAM counts are confusing because RAM uses megabytes and
gigabytes as opposed to millions and billions. Here are some ex-
amples of how different systems would show 256 MB of RAM:
268435456 (exactly 256 × 1 MB)
256M (some PCs try to make it easy for you)
262,144 (number of KB)
You should know how much RAM you’re trying to install and
use some common sense. If you’ve got 512 MB and you add an-
other 512-MB stick, you need a number that looks like one giga-
byte. If after you add the second stick, you see a RAM count of
524582912—that sure looks like 512 MB, not the one gigabyte!
Installing SO-DIMMs in Laptops
It wasn’t that long ago that adding RAM to a laptop was either im-
possible or required you to send the system back to the manufac-
turer. For years, every laptop maker had custom-made, proprietary

RAM packages that were difficult to handle and stagger-
ingly expensive. The wide acceptance of SO-DIMMs over
the last few years has virtually erased these problems. All
laptops now provide relatively convenient access to their
SO-DIMMs, enabling easy replacement or addition of
RAM.
Access to RAM usually requires removing a panel or
lifting up the keyboard—the procedure varies among
laptop manufacturers. Figure 3.11 shows a typical laptop
RAM access panel. You can slide the panel off to reveal
the SO-DIMMs. SO-DIMMs usually insert exactly like the
old SIMMs—slide the pins into position and snap the
SO-DIMM down into the retaining clips (Figure 3.12).
Before doing any work on a laptop, turn the system
off, disconnect it from the AC wall socket, and remove all
batteries. Use an anti-static wrist strap because laptops
are far more susceptible to ESD than desktop PCs.
■Troubleshooting RAM
“Memory” errors show up in a variety of ways on modern systems, including
parity errors, ECC error messages, system lockups, page faults, and other error
screens in Windows. These errors can indicate bad RAM, but often point to
something completely unrelated to RAM. This is especially true with intermit-
tent problems. The challenge for techs is to recognize these errors and then de-
termine which part of the system caused the memory error.
You can get two radically different types of parity errors: real and
phantom. Real parity errors are simply errors that the MCC detects from the
38
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
• Figure 3.11

• Figure 3.12
Snapping in an SO-DIMM

parity or ECC chips (if you have them). The operating system then reports
the problem in an error message, such as “Parity error at xxxx:xxxxxxxx,”
where xxxx:xxxxxxxx is a hexadecimal value (a string of numbers and
letters, like A5F2:004EEAB9). If you get an error like this, write down the
value. A real parity/ECC error will show up at the same place in memory
each time, and almost always indicates that you have a bad RAM stick.
Phantom parity errors show up on systems that don’t have parity or
ECC memory. If Windows generates parity errors with different addresses,
you most likely do not have a problem with RAM. These phantom errors can
occur for a variety of reasons, including software problems, heat or dust, so-
lar flares, fluctuations in the Force … you get the idea.
System lockups and page faults (they often go hand in hand) in Win-
dows can indicate a problem with RAM. A system lockup is when the com-
puter stops functioning. A page fault is a milder error that can be caused by
memory issues, but not necessarily system RAM problems. Certainly page
faults look like RAM issues because Windows generates frightening error
messages filled with long strings of hexadecimal digits, such as “KRNL386
caused a page fault at 03F2:25A003BC.” (See Figure 3.13.) Just because the
error message contains a memory address, however, does not mean that you
have a problem with your RAM. Write down the address. If it repeats in later
error messages, you probably have a bad RAM stick. If Windows displays
different memory locations, you need to look elsewhere for the culprit.
Every once in a while, something potentially catastrophic happens
within the PC, some little electron hits the big red panic button, and the

Windows error message

operating system has to shut down certain functions running in order to
save data. This panic button inside the PC is called a non-maskable interrupt
(NMI) , more simply defined as an interruption the CPU cannot ignore. An
NMI manifests to the user as what techs lovingly call the Blue Screen of
Death (BSoD) —a bright blue screen with a scary-sounding error message on
it (Figure 3.14).
Bad RAM sometimes triggers an NMI, although often the culprit lies
with buggy programming or clashing code. The BSoD varies according to
the operating system, and it would require a much lengthier tome than this
one to cover all the variations. Suffice it to say that RAM could be the prob-
lem when that delightful blue screen appears.
Finally, intermittent memory errors can come from a variety of sources,
including a dying power supply, electrical interference, buggy applications,
buggy hardware, and so on. These errors show up as lockups, general pro-
tection faults, page faults, and parity errors, but never have the same ad-
dress or happen with the same applications. Try the power supply first with
non-application-specific intermittent errors of any sort.
Testing RAM
Once you discover that you may have a RAM problem, you have a couple of
options. First, several companies manufacture hardware RAM testing de-
vices, but unless you have a lot of disposable income, they’re probably
priced way too high for the average tech (US$1500 and higher). Second, you
can use the method I use—replace and pray. Open the system case and re-
place each stick, one at a time, with a known good replacement stick.

A general protection fault
(GPF) is an error that can cause

they’re caused by programs
stepping on each other’s toes.

on Windows errors.

(You have one of those lying around, don’t you?) This method, although po-
tentially time-consuming, certainly works. With PC prices as low as they are
now, you could simply replace the whole system for less than the price of a
dedicated RAM tester.
Third, you could run a software-based tester on the RAM. Because you
have to load a software tester into the memory it’s about to scan, there’s al-
ways a small chance that simply starting the software RAM tester might
cause an error. Still, you can find some pretty good free ones out there. My
favorite is the venerable
Memtest86
written by Mr. Chris Brady
(www.memtest86.com). Memtest86 will exhaustively check your RAM and
report bad RAM when it finds it (Figure 3.15).
Beyond A+
The Next Generations
Computer games have done more for advances in PC hardware than
anything else. Have you ever seen a late-generation game such as Half-Life
2 or Far Cry? These games require powerful video cards, and every video
card comes with DRAM. To make these beautiful games, the video card’s
DRAM needs to be incredibly fast. Video card makers adopted many
DRAM technologies such as DDR even before they were popular as system
RAM on PCs. If you want to see where DRAM is going, check out video
cards (Figure 3.16).
Two advancements to DDR2 originally found only in video cards will
show up as primary system memory within a year of this writing: DDR3
and DDR4. DDR3 uses even less power than DDR2 and doubles again the
speed of the DRAM’s I/O. DDR4 chips push the speed even higher than
DDR3!

Tech Tip
Serial Connections
Serial connections run ones and
zeroes through a single wire, as
opposed to parallel connections
that use many wires. With only
one wire to worry about, manu-
facturers can heavily shield serial
connections and make them run
blazingly fast. You’ll see the shift
from parallel to serial in many as-
pects of the modern PC.

DDR3 and DDR4 will almost certainly appear in the upcoming fully buf-
fered DIMMs (FB-DIMMs) . FB-DIMMs are registered⎯but with a twist.
They replace the 64-bit-wide DIMM data connection with a staggeringly
fast serial connection, expected to reach as much as 4.8 GBps! That should be
fast enough to keep our PCs happy for the next few years!

Chapter 3 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises,
you should understand the following about installing
and troubleshooting RAM.
Working with RAM
■
Disk thrashing is constant hard drive activity
symptomatic of insufficient RAM. It occurs when
Windows repeatedly uses up all available RAM
space and has to move data not immediately
needed out of the RAM into a temporary file on the
hard drive called a swap file or page file, and then
swap the data back into RAM when it is needed by
the program. You can monitor the size of your
swap file in the Task Manager.
■
You must know what type of RAM (such as
regular SDRAM, DDR RAM, or DDR2 RAM) your
motherboard accepts before you purchase a RAM
upgrade. You also need to know the maximum
amount of RAM your motherboard supports and
the maximum supported per slot.
■
Though not required, it is good practice to make
sure all sticks of RAM in any system are as close to
identical as possible. It will lessen the chance of
problems and incompatibility if your RAM
modules match in technology, capacity, speed, and
manufacturer.
■
The serial presence detect (SPD) chip on modern
DIMMs automatically supplies all the information
about the RAM to the system, such as the size,
speed, ECC or non-ECC, registered or
unregistered, and other details.
■
Installing SO-DIMMs in a laptop requires the
removal of a panel on the underside of the laptop
or removing the keyboard to find the RAM slots.
The SO-DIMM slides into the slot and snaps down
into position. Unplug the laptop and remove the
battery before attempting a RAM upgrade, and
protect the RAM from ESD by wearing an
anti-static wristband.
Troubleshooting RAM
■
Symptoms of bad RAM include parity errors,
system lockups, page faults, and other error
screens in Windows. However, other failing
components can cause similar problems. Bad RAM
usually results in error screens displaying
messages such as “Parity error at xxxx:xxxxxxxx”
where xxxx:xxxxxxxx is a hexadecimal value such
as A5F2:004EEAB9. A real parity error will show
up in the same place in memory each time—if that
hexadecimal code is always the same, you
probably have bad RAM.
■
Page faults result in error screens such as
“KRNL386 caused a page fault at 03F2:25A003BC.”
The process that caused the page fault (in this case,
KRNL386) may change, but if the hexadecimal
address is the same across numerous error screens,
you probably have bad RAM.
■
A non-maskable interrupt (NMI) results in a Blue
Screen of Death (BSoD). Although BSoDs are often
blamed on bad RAM, they are more often caused
by buggy application program code.
■
If you suspect you have bad RAM and you don’t
have a hardware RAM testing device, swap one of
the sticks in your system with a known-good stick.
If the system works, you’ve found the bad stick. If
the system still has errors, replace the stick you
removed and swap a different stick for the
known-good stick. Another option is to use a
software RAM tester like Memtest86.

he CMOS setup program is used to configure your PC’s most critical
hardware, but what happens when critical hardware isn’t working properly?
For example, how do you know if your keyboard has become unplugged or your
hard drive has suddenly died? That’s what you’ll learn in this chapter. Here
you’ll be introduced to the testing part of BIOS—the power-on self test (POST).
You’ll learn how the POST informs you of problems and how to deal with those
problems as they arrive. This chapter also covers how to maintain your BIOS/
CMOS by working with the onboard CMOS battery. You’ll even learn how to

■Power-On Self Test (POST)
BIOS isn’t the only program on your system ROM. When the computer is
turned on or reset, it initiates a special program, also stored on the system
ROM chip, called the power-on self test (POST) . The POST program checks
out the system every time the computer boots. To perform this check, the
POST sends out a command that says to all the devices, “Check yourselves
out!” All the standard devices in the computer then run their own internal
diagnostic—the POST doesn’t specify what they must check. The quality of
the diagnostic is up to the people who made that particular device.
Let’s consider the POST for a moment. Suppose some device—let’s say
it’s the keyboard controller chip—runs its diagnostic and determines that it
is not working properly. What can the POST do about it? Only one thing re-
ally: Tell the human in front of the PC! So how does the computer tell the hu-
man? PCs convey POST information to you in two ways: beep codes and
text error codes.
Before and During the Video Test:
The Beep Codes
The computer tests the most basic parts of the computer first, up to and
including the video card. In early PCs, you’d hear a series of beeps—called
beep codes —if anything went wrong. By using beep codes before and
during the video test, the computer could communicate with you. (If a POST
48
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
You’ll find lots of online doc-
umentation about beep codes,
but it’s usually badly outdated!

error occurs before the video is available, obviously the error must manifest
itself as beeps because nothing can display on the screen.) The meaning of
the beep code you’d hear varied among different BIOS manufacturers. You
could find the beep codes for a specific motherboard in its motherboard
manual.
Most modern PCs have only a single beep code, which is for bad or miss-
ing video—one long beep followed by three short beeps.
You’ll hear three other beep sequences on most PCs (although they’re
not officially beep codes). At the end of a successful POST, the PC will pro-
duce one or two short beeps, simply to inform you that all is well. Most sys-
tems make a rather strange noise when the RAM is missing or very seriously
damaged. Unlike traditional beep codes, this code repeats until you shut off
the system. Finally, your speaker might make beeps for reasons that aren’t
POST or boot related. One of the more common is a series of short beeps af-
ter the system’s been running for a while. That’s a CPU alarm telling you the
CPU is approaching its high heat limit.
Text Errors
After the video has tested okay, any POST errors will display on the
screen as a text error . If you get a text error, the problem is usually, but
not always, self-explanatory (Figure 4.1). Text errors are far more useful
than beep codes because you can simply read the screen to determine
the bad device.
POST Cards
Beep codes and text error codes, although helpful, can sometimes be mis-
leading. Worse than that, an inoperative device can sometimes disrupt the
POST, forcing the machine into an endless loop. This causes the PC to act
dead—no beeps and nothing on the screen. In this case, you need a device,
called a POST card , to monitor the POST and identify which piece of hard-
ware is causing the trouble.
POST cards are simple cards that snap into an
expansion slot on your system. A small, two-character
light-emitting
diode
(LED)
readout
on the card
indicates what device the POST is currently testing
(Figure 4.2). The documentation that comes with the
POST card tells you what the codes mean. BIOS makers
also provide this information on their Web sites.
Manufacturers make POST cards for all types of
desktop PCs. POST cards work with any BIOS, but you
need to know the type of BIOS you have in order to
interpret the readout properly.
I usually only pull out a POST card when the usual
POST errors fail to appear. When a computer provides
a beep or text error code that doesn’t make sense, or if
your machine keeps locking up, some device has
stalled the POST. Because the POST card will tell you
which device is being tested, the frozen system will
Chapter 4: Working with BIOS and CMOS

Tech Tip
Talking BIOS
Some newer motherboards can
also talk to you if there is a prob-
lem during POST. To use this
feature, all that is normally re-
quired is to plug a pair of speak-
ers or headphones into the
onboard sound card.
• Figure 4.1
Text error messages
• Figure 4.2
POST card in action

stay at that point in the POST, and the error will stay on the POST card’s
readout.
Many companies sell POST cards today, with prices ranging from the af-
fordable to the outrageous. Spend the absolute least amount of money you
can. The more expensive cards add bells and whistles that you do not need,
such as diagnostic software and voltmeters.
Using a POST card is straightforward. Simply power down the PC, in-
stall the POST card in any unused slot, and turn the PC back on. As you
watch the POST display, notice the different hexadecimal readouts and re-
fer to them as the POST progresses. Notice how quickly they change. If you
get an “FF” or “00,” that means the POST is over and everything
passed—time to check the operating system. If a device stalls the POST,
however, the POST card will display an error code. That’s the problem de-
vice! Good technicians often memorize a dozen or more different POST
codes because it’s much faster than looking them up in a book.
So you got a beep code, a text error code, or a POST error. Now what do
you do with that knowledge? Remember that a POST error does not fix the
computer; it only tells you where to look. You then have to know how to
deal with that bad or improperly configured component. If you use a POST
card, for example, and it hangs at the “Initializing Floppy Drive” test, you’d
better know how to work on a floppy drive!
Sometimes the POST card returns a bizarre or confusing error code.
What device do you point at when you get a “CMOS shutdown register
read/write error” beep code from an older system? First of all, read the error
carefully. Let’s say on that same system you got an “8042—gate A20 failure”
beep code. What will you do? Assuming you know (and you should!) that
the “8042” refers to the keyboard, a quick peek at the keyboard and its con-
nection would be a good first step. Beyond that specific example, here is a
good general rule: If you don’t know what the error means or the bad part is-
n’t replaceable, replace the motherboard. Clearly, you will stumble across
exceptions to this rule, but more often than not, the rule stands.
The Boot Process
All PCs need a process to begin their operations. Once you feed power to the
PC, the tight interrelation of hardware, firmware (programming stored on
chips), and software (programming stored on mass storage) enables the PC
to start itself, to “pull itself up by the bootstraps” or boot itself.
When you first power on a PC, the power supply circuitry tests for
proper voltage and then sends a signal down a special wire called the power
good wire to awaken the CPU. In every Intel and clone CPU, the moment the
power good wire wakes up the CPU, the CPU immediately sends a built-in
memory address via its address bus. This special address is the same on
every Intel and clone CPU, from the oldest 8086 to the most recent
microprocessor. This address is the first line of the POST program on the
system ROM! That’s how the system starts the POST.
After the POST has finished, there must be a way for the computer to
find the programs on the hard drive to start the operating system. The POST
50
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

passes control to the last BIOS function: the bootstrap loader. The boot-
strap loader is little more than a few dozen lines of BIOS code tacked to
the end of the POST program. Its job is to find the operating system. The
bootstrap loader reads CMOS information to tell it where to look first
for an operating system. Your PC’s CMOS setup utility has an option
that you configure to tell the bootstrap loader which devices to check for
an operating system and in which order (Figure 4.3).
Almost all storage devices—floppy disks, hard disks, CDs, DVDs, and
even USB thumb drives—can be configured to boot an operating system by
setting aside a specific location called the boot sector. If the device is bootable,
its boot sector will contain special programming designed to tell the system
where to locate the operating system. Any device with a functional operat-
ing system is called a bootable disk or a system disk . If the bootstrap loader
locates a good boot sector, it passes control to the operating system and re-
moves itself from memory. If it doesn’t, it will go to the next device in the
boot order you set in the CMOS setup utility. Boot order is an important tool
for techs because it enables you to load in special bootable devices so you
can run utilities to maintain PCs without using the primary operating
system.
■Care and Feeding of BIOS
and CMOS
BIOS and CMOS are areas in your PC that you don’t go to very often. BIOS
itself is invisible. The only real clue you have that it even exists is the POST.
The CMOS setup utility, on the other hand, is very visible if you start it.
Most CMOS setup utilities today work acceptably well without ever being
touched. You’re an aspiring tech, however, and all self-respecting techs start
up the CMOS setup utility and make changes. That’s when most CMOS
setup utility problems take place.
If you mess with the CMOS setup utility, remember to make only as
many changes at one time as you can remember. Document the original set-
tings and the changes on a piece of paper. That way, you can put things back
if necessary. Don’t make changes unless you know what they mean! It’s
easy to screw up a computer fairly seriously by playing with CMOS settings
you don’t understand.
Losing CMOS Settings
Your CMOS needs a continuous trickle charge to retain its data. Mother-
boards use some type of battery, usually a coin battery like those used in
wrist watches, to give the CMOS the charge it needs when the computer is
turned off (Figure 4.4). This battery also keeps track of the date and time
when the PC is turned off.
If the battery runs out of charge, you lose all of your CMOS information.
If some mishap suddenly erases the information on the CMOS chip, the
computer might not boot up or you’ll get nasty-looking errors at boot. Any
PC made after 2002 will boot to factory defaults if the CMOS clears, so the

Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
chances of not booting are slim⎯but you’ll still get errors at boot. Here are a
few examples of errors that point to lost CMOS information:
■
CMOS configuration mismatch
■
CMOS date/time not set
■
No boot device available
■
CMOS battery state low
Here are some of the more common reasons for losing CMOS data:
■
Pulling and inserting cards
■
Touching the motherboard
■
Dropping something on the motherboard
■
Dirt on the motherboard
■
Faulty power supplies
■
Electrical surges
■
Chip creep
Most of these items should be fairly self-explanatory, but chip creep
might be a new term for some of you. As PCs run, the components inside get
warm. When a PC is turned off, the components cool off. This cycling of hot
and cold causes the chips to expand and contract in their mounts. While the
chip designers account for this, in some extreme cases this thermal expan-
sion and contraction will cause a chip to work out of its mount and cause a
failure called chip creep . Chip creep was a common problem in the earlier
days of PCs, but after more than a quarter century of experience, the PC in-
dustry has done a pretty good job of designing mounts that will hold all
your chips in place dependably.

If you encounter any of these errors, or if the clock in Windows resets it-
self to January 1st every time you reboot the system, the battery on the
motherboard is losing its charge and needs to be replaced. To replace it, use
a screwdriver to pry the battery’s catch gently back. The battery should pop
up for easy removal. Before you install the new battery, double-check that it
has the same voltage and amperage as the old battery. To retain your CMOS
settings while replacing the battery, simply leave your PC plugged into an
AC outlet. The 5-volt soft power on all modern motherboards will provide
enough electricity to keep the CMOS charged and the data secure. Of
course, I know you’re going to be extremely careful about ESD while prying
up the battery from a live system!
Clearing CMOS
All techs invariably do things in CMOS they want to undo, but sometimes
simply making a change in CMOS prevents you from getting back to the
CMOS setup utility to make the change back. A great example is when
someone sets a CMOS password and then forgets the password. If you ever
run into a system with an unknown CMOS password, you’ll need to erase
the CMOS and then reset everything. All motherboards have a clear CMOS
jumper somewhere on the motherboard (Figure 4.5). Check your mother-
board book for the correct location.
To clear the CMOS, turn off the PC. Then locate one of those tiny little
plastic pieces (officially called a shunt) and place it over the two jumper
wires for a moment. Next, restart the PC and immediately go into CMOS
and restore the settings you need.
Flashing ROM
Flash ROM chips can be reprogrammed to update their contents. With flash
ROM, when you need to update your system BIOS to add support for a new
technology, you can simply run a small command-line program, combined
with an update file, and voilà, you’ve got a new, updated BIOS! Different
• Figure 4.5
Clear CMOS jumper

BIOS makers use slightly different processes for flashing the BIOS , but in
general you must boot from a floppy diskette and then run the relevant up-
dating command from the A:\> prompt. This example shows how simple it
can be:
A:\> aw athxpt2.bin
Some motherboard makers even provide Windows-based flash ROM
update utilities that will check the Internet for updates and download them
for you to install (Figure 4.6). Most of these utilities will also enable you to
back up your current BIOS so you can return to it if the updated version
causes trouble. Without a good backup, you could end up throwing away
your motherboard if a flash BIOS update goes wrong, so you should always
make one! Finally, don’t update your BIOS unless you have some compel-
ling reason to do so. As the old saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!”

Chapter 4 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
working with BIOS and CMOS.
Power-On Self Test (POST)
■
In addition to the BIOS routines and the CMOS
setup program, the system ROM also includes a
special program called the power-on self test
(POST) that is executed every time the computer
boots. POST first has basic devices up to and
including video run self-diagnostic. If a device
detects an error, the computer alerts you with a
series of beeps. Different ROM manufacturers have
used different beep codes, but your motherboard
book should explain them (particularly in older
systems). After the basic devices, POST tells the
rest of the devices to run tests and displays a text
error message on the screen if anything is wrong.
Some manufacturers use numeric error codes or
combine numeric and text messages.
■
The computer may beep in two situations that are
not related to POST beep codes. If the computer
beeps constantly until you shut it off, it means that
RAM is missing or damaged. If the computer beeps
after it is booted, it is probably a warning that the
system is overheating.
■
If the computer appears dead with no beeps or
screen response, you can place a POST card in an
expansion slot to diagnose the problem using the
LED readout on the card. The documentation that
comes with the POST card will explain the LED
codes for your particular BIOS.
■
A beep code, text error message, or POST error
may identify a problem, but it does not fix it. After
you know which device is causing the problem,
you should check the connection for the
troublesome device and replace it if possible. If you
cannot remove the bad part or if you cannot
interpret the error message, you may need to
replace the motherboard.
■
The last job of the BIOS is to start the boot process.
The CPU is the first component that wakes up. It
checks the power good wire of the power supply to
see that it has sufficient voltage to begin the
booting process. If so, the CPU issues a memory
address that executes the first line of the POST
program. After POST has finished, it passes control
to the bootstrap loader function on the system
BIOS. This program looks for an operating system,
checking the floppy drive, hard drives, or other
bootable devices to find the boot sector that
identifies the location of the operating system.
When the BIOS finds a bootable or system disk or
device that has a functional operating system, it
passes control to that disk or device.
Care and Feeding of BIOS/CMOS
■
A constant trickle of electricity is provided to
CMOS via the motherboard battery. A dead battery
results in the loss of all CMOS data and the
computer’s date and time information. Old PCs
may not even boot with a dead motherboard
battery and cleared CMOS data, but PCs made
after 2002 will boot to factory defaults.
■
Turning a PC on and off results in a cycle of
heating and cooling. This causes components to
contract and expand and possibly creep out of their
sockets. Modern systems feature well-designed
mounts that hold the chips better, so chip creep is
rare on newer systems.
■
To replace a motherboard battery, gently pry back
the battery socket’s catch with a screwdriver until
you can remove the old battery. Double-check the
replacement battery for the proper voltage and
amperage, and make sure to pay attention to
whether the positive or negative side goes up or
down. You can retain your current CMOS data
while changing the battery by leaving the PC
plugged into an AC wall outlet (being extremely
careful to avoid ESD).
■
To clear all CMOS data, including any CMOS
passwords, locate the clear CMOS jumper on the
motherboard. Typically, you turn off the PC,
reposition the jumper shunt, and reboot. However,
it’s always a good idea to consult the motherboard
manual for the procedure for your system.

IT Technician
■Installing Expansion Cards
Installing an expansion card successfully—another one of those bread-and-
butter tasks for the PC tech—requires at least four steps. First, you need to
know that the card works with your system and your operating system. Sec-
ond, you have to insert the card in an expansion slot properly and without
damaging that card or the motherboard. Third, you need to provide drivers
for the operating system—that’s proper drivers for the specific OS. Fourth,
you should always verify that the card functions properly before you walk
away from the PC.
Step 1: Knowledge
Learn about the device you plan to install—preferably before you purchase
it! Does the device work with your system and operating system? Does it
have drivers for your operating system? If you use Windows, the answer to
these questions is almost always “yes.” If you use an old operating system
like Windows 98 or a less common operating system such as Linux, these
questions become critical. A lot of older, pre-XP hardware simply won’t
work with Windows XP at all. Check the device’s documentation and check
the device manufacturer’s Web site to verify that you have the correct driv-
ers. While you’re checking, make sure that you have the latest version of the
driver; most devices get driver updates more often than the weather
changes in Texas.
For Windows systems, your best resource for this knowledge is the
Windows Marketplace . This used to be called the Hardware Compatibility
List (HCL) , and you’ll still hear lots of people refer to it as such. You can
check out the Web site (http://testedproducts.windowsmarketplace.com)
to see if your product is listed, but most people just look on the box of the de-
vice in question (Figure 5.1)⎯all Windows-certified devices will proudly
display that they work with Windows.

Tech Tip
Installation Order
Some manufacturers insist on a
different order for device installa-
tion than the traditional one
listed here. The most common
variation requires you to install
the drivers and support software
for an expansion card before you
insert the card. Failure to follow
the manufacturer’s directions
with such a card can lead to
hours of frustration while you
uninstall the card and reinstall
the drivers, sometimes manually
removing some drivers and soft-
ware from the system. The bottom
line? Read the instructions that
come with a particular card! I’ll
provide more specific examples of
problem devices in later chapters.
Windows Marketplace is also
a great resource to check
whether a particular software
program works with your ver-
sion of Windows.

Step 2: Physical Installation
To install an expansion card successfully, you need to take steps to
avoid damaging the card, the motherboard, or both. This means
knowing how to handle a card and avoiding electrostatic dis-
charge (ESD) or any other electrical issue. You also need to place
the card firmly and completely into an available expansion slot.
Optimally, a card should always be in one of two places: in a
computer or in an anti-static bag. When inserting or removing a
card, be careful to hold the card only by its edges. Do not hold the
card by the slot connectors or touch any components on the board
(Figure 5.2).
Use an anti-static wrist strap if possible, properly attached to
the PC. If you don’t have a wrist strap, you can use the tech way of
avoiding ESD by touching the power supply after you remove the
expansion card from its anti-static bag. This puts you, the card, and
the PC at the same electrical potential and thus minimizes the risk
of ESD.
Modern systems have a trickle of voltage on the motherboard at all times
when the computer is plugged into a power outlet. Chapter 7, “Installing
and Troubleshooting Power Supplies,” covers power for the PC and how to
deal with it in detail, but here’s the short version: Always unplug the PC before
inserting an expansion card! Failure to do so can destroy the card, the mother-
board, or both. It’s not worth the risk!
Never insert or remove a card at an extreme angle. This may damage the
card. A slight angle is acceptable and even necessary when removing a card.
Always screw the card to the case with a connection screw. This keeps
the card from slipping out and potentially shorting against other cards.
Chapter 5: Installing Internal Devices
61
• Figure 5.1
Works with Windows!
• Figure 5.2
Where to handle a card

Also, many cards use the screw connection to ground the card to the case
(Figure 5.3).
Many technicians have been told to clean the slot connectors if a par-
ticular card is not working. This is almost never necessary after a card is
installed, and if done improperly, can cause damage. You should clean
slot connectors only if you have a card that’s been on the shelf for a while
and the contacts are obviously dull. Never use a pencil eraser for this pur-
pose. Pencil erasers can leave behind bits of residue that wedge between
the card and slot, preventing contact and causing the card to fail. Grab a
can of contact cleaning solution and use it instead. Contact cleaning solu-
tion is designed exactly for this purpose, will clean the contact nicely,
and won’t leave any residue. You can find contact cleaning solution at
any electronics store.
A fully inserted expansion card will sit flush against the back of the
PC case—assuming the motherboard is mounted properly, of course—
with no gap between the mounting bracket on the card and the screw
hole on the case. If the card is properly seated, no contacts will be ex-
posed above the slot. Figure 5.4 shows a properly seated (meaning fitted
snugly in the slot) expansion card.
Step 3: Device Drivers
You know from the Essentials course that all devices, whether built into the
motherboard or added along the way, require BIOS. For almost all expan-
sion cards, that BIOS comes in the form of device drivers —software sup-
port programs—loaded from a CD-ROM disc provided by the card
manufacturer.
Installing device drivers is fairly straightforward. You should use the
correct drivers—kind of obvious, but you’d be surprised how many techs
mess this up—and, if you’re upgrading, you might have to unload current
drivers before loading new drivers. Finally, if you have a problem, you may
need to uninstall the drivers you just loaded or, with Windows XP, roll
back to earlier, more stable drivers.
Getting the Correct Drivers
To be sure you have the best possible driver you can get for your device,
you should always check the manufacturer’s Web site. The drivers that

BIOS
Although most devices bring their own BIOS in the form of device driv-
ers, that’s not always the case as you know from the Essentials course.
See if you can answer these questions. What other way can a device
bring BIOS to a system not originally built anticipating its installation?
What about devices that are common and necessary, like the keyboard?
How do they bring their own BIOS to a system? Or do they?

come with a device may work well, but
odds are good that you’ll find a newer
and better driver on the Web site. How
do you know that the drivers on the
Web site are newer? First, take the easy
route: look on the CD. Often the version
is printed right on the CD itself. If it’s
not printed there, you’re going to have
to load the CD in your CD-ROM drive
and poke around. Many driver discs
have an AutoRun screen that advertises
the version. If there’s nothing on the
pop-up screen, look for a Readme file
(Figure 5.5).
Driver or Device?
In almost all cases, you should install
the device driver after you install the device. Without the device in-
stalled, the driver installation will not see the device and will give an
error screen. The only exceptions to this rule are USB and FireWire
devices—with these you should always install the driver first!
Removing the Old Drivers
Some cards—and this is especially true with video cards—require you
to remove old drivers of the same type before you install the new de-
vice. To do this, you must first locate the driver in Device Manager.
Right-click the device driver you want to uninstall and select Uninstall
(Figure 5.6). Many devices, especially ones that come with a lot of ap-
plications, will have an uninstall option in the Add/Remove Programs
(Windows 2000) or Add or Remove Programs (Windows XP) applet in
the Control Panel (Figure 5.7).
Unsigned Drivers
Microsoft wants your computer to work, it really does, and the company
provides an excellent and rigorous testing program for hardware manufac-
turers called the Microsoft Windows Logo Program . Developers initially use
software to test their devices and, when they’re ready, submit the device to
the Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) for further testing. Hardware
and drivers that survive the WHQL and other processes get to wear the
Designed for Windows logo . The drivers get a digital signature that says
Microsoft tested and found all was well.
Not all driver makers go through the rather involved process of the
WHQL and other steps in the Windows Logo Program, so their software
does not get a digital signature from Microsoft. When Windows runs into
such a driver, it brings up a scary-looking screen (Figure 5.8) that says
you’re about to install an unsigned driver .
The fact that a company refuses to use the Windows Logo Program
doesn’t mean that its drivers are bad—it simply means that they haven’t gone
through Microsoft’s exhaustive quality-assurance certification procedure.
Chapter 5: Installing Internal Devices
63
• Figure 5.5
Part of a Readme file showing the driver version
• Figure 5.6
Uninstalling a device

If I run into this, I usually check the driver’s version to make sure I’m
not installing something outdated, and then I just take my chances
and install it. (I’ve yet to encounter a problem with an unsigned
driver that I haven’t also seen with Designed for Windows drivers.)
Installing the New Driver
You’ve got two ways to install a new driver: using the installation
CD directly or using the Add Hardware Wizard in the Control
Panel. Most experienced techs prefer to run from the installation
CD. Most devices come with extra programs. My motherboard
comes with a number of handy applications for monitoring tempera-
ture and overclocking. The Add Hardware Wizard does not install
anything but the drivers. Granted, some techs find this a blessing
because they don’t want all the extra junk that sometimes comes
with a device, but most installation discs give clear options to
enable you to pick and choose what you want to install (Figure 5.9).
The other reason to use installation CDs instead of the Add
Hardware Wizard stems from the fact that many expansion cards are actu-
ally many devices in one, and each device needs its own drivers. Sound
cards often come with joystick ports, for example, and video cards often
have built-in TV tuners. The Add Hardware Wizard will install all the de-
vices, but the installation CD brings them to your attention. Go for the CD
program first and save the Add Hardware Wizard for problems, as you’ll
see in the next section.

Driver Rollback
Windows XP offers the nifty driver rollback feature for rolling back to previ-
ous drivers after an installation or driver upgrade. If you decide to live on
the edge and install beta drivers for your video card, for example, and your
system becomes frightfully unstable, you can back up to the drivers that
worked before. (Not that I’ve ever had to use that feature, of course!) To ac-
cess the rollback feature, simply open Device Manager and access the prop-
erties for the device you want to adjust. On the Driver tab (Figure 5.10),
you’ll find the Roll Back Driver button.

Tech Tip
Permissions
To install drivers in a Windows
computer, you need to have the
proper permission. I’m not talk-
ing about asking somebody if
you’re allowed to install the de-
vice! Permissions are granted in
Windows to enable people to per-
form certain tasks, such as adding
a printer to a computer or install-
ing software, or to stop people
from being able to do such tasks.
Specifically, you need adminis-
trative permissions to install
drivers.
Tech Tip
Beta Drivers
Many PC enthusiasts try to
squeeze every bit of performance
out of their PC components,
much like auto enthusiasts tinker
with engine tunings to get a little
extra horsepower out of their en-
gines. Expansion card manufac-
turers love enthusiasts, who often
act as free testers for their unpol-
ished drivers, known as beta
drivers. Beta drivers are fine for
the most part, but they can some-
times cause amazing system in-
stability—never a good thing! If
you use beta drivers, make sure
you know how to uninstall or roll
back to previous drivers.

Installation menu
• Figure 5.10
Driver rollback feature

Step 4: Verify
As a last step in the installation
process, inspect the results of
the installation and verify that
the device works properly. Im-
mediately after installing, you
should open Device Manager
and verify that Windows sees
the device (Figure 5.11). As-
suming that Device Manager
shows the device working prop-
erly, your next check is to put
the device to work by making it
do whatever it is supposed to
do. If you installed a printer,
print something; if you in-
stalled a scanner, scan some-
thing. If it works, you’re done!
■Troubleshooting Expansion Cards
A properly installed expansion card rarely makes trouble⎯it’s the botched
installations that produce headaches. Chances are high that you’ll have to
troubleshoot an expansion card installation at some point, usually from an
installation that you botched personally.
The first sign of an improperly installed card usually shows up the mo-
ment you first try to get that card to do whatever it’s supposed to do and it
doesn’t do it. When this happens, your primary troubleshooting process is a
reinstallation⎯after checking in with Device Manager.
Other chapters in this book cover specific hardware troubleshoot-
ing—sound cards in Chapter 13, for example, and video cards in Chapter 12.
Use this section as your general methodology to decide what to look for and
how to deal with the problem.
Device Manager
Device Manager provides the first diagnostic and troubleshooting tool in
Windows. After you install a new device, Device Manager gives you many
clues if something has gone wrong.
Occasionally, Device Manager may not even show the new device. If
that happens, verify that you inserted the device properly and, if needed,
that the device has power. Run the Add/Remove Hardware Wizard and see
if Windows recognizes the device. If Device Manager doesn’t recognize
the device at this point, you have one of two problems: either the device is
physically damaged and you must replace it, or the device is an onboard de-
vice, not a card, and is turned off in CMOS.

• Figure 5.11
Device Manager shows the device working properly.

It’s rare that Device Manager completely fails to see a device. More com-
monly, device problems manifest themselves in Device Manager via error
icons—a black “!” or a red “X” or a blue “i.”
■
A black “!” on a yellow circle indicates that a device is
missing, that Windows does not recognize a device, or
that there’s a device driver problem. A device may still
work even while producing this error.
■
A red “X” indicates a disabled device (Figure 5.12). This
usually points to a device that’s been manually turned off,
or a damaged device. A device producing this error will
not work.
■
A blue “i” on a white field indicates a device on which
someone has configured the system resources manually.
This only occurs on non-ACPI systems. This symbol
merely provides information and does not indicate an
error with the device.
The “!” symbol is the most common error symbol and usually
the easiest to fix. First, double-check the device’s connections.
Second, try reinstalling the driver with the Update Driver button.
To get to the Update Driver button, right-click the desired device
in Device Manager and select Properties. In the Properties dialog
box, select the Driver tab. On the Driver tab, click the Update
Driver button (Figure 5.13).
A red “X” error strikes fear into most technicians. If you get
one, first check that the device isn’t disabled. Right-click on the
device and select Enable. If that doesn’t
work (it often will not), try rolling back
the driver (if you updated the driver)
or uninstalling (if it’s a new install).
Shut the system down and make tri-
ple-sure you have the card physically
installed. Then redo the entire driver
installation procedure, making sure
you have the most current driver for
that device. If none of these procedures
works, return the card⎯it’s almost
certainly bad.
As you look at the errors in Device
Manager, you’ll notice error codes for
the device that does not work properly.
Windows has about 20 error codes, but
the fixes still boil down to the same
methods just shown. If you really want
to frustrate yourself, try the Trouble-
shooter. It starts most fixes the same
way⎯by reinstalling the device driver.

Chapter 5 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
installing internal devices.
Installing Expansion Cards
■
There are four basic steps to follow when installing
an expansion card: determine that the card is
compatible with your system, physically install the
card, install the drivers, and verify that the card
works.
■
Determine that the card is compatible with your
system. Many older cards do not work with
Windows XP, and not every card works with older
versions of Windows or other operating systems
(such as Linux or Macintosh). Read the box before
you buy, consult the device manufacturer’s Web
site, and if Windows is your operating system,
consult the Windows Marketplace (formerly the
Hardware Compatibility List).
■
Physically install the card without damaging it or
other system components. Keep the card in its
anti-static bag until you are ready to install it.
Power off and unplug the computer. Wear an
anti-static wrist strap or use an alternative method
of dissipating static electricity.
■
Install the correct drivers, which should come on a
CD with the device. If you don’t have the CD, you
may be able to download the drivers from the
manufacturer’s Web site.
■
Some manufacturers use the Microsoft Windows
Logo Program to verify and digitally sign their
drivers. This means their drivers have been
verified by Microsoft to work properly. Other
manufacturers skip the certification process and
produce unsigned drivers that in most cases work
just fine.
■
Sometimes driver updates go bad and you find the
new driver just doesn’t work. With Windows XP,
you can roll back to the previous version driver by
double-clicking the device in Device Manager,
clicking the Driver tab, and then clicking the Roll
Back Driver button.
■
Always verify that your newly installed device
works. Immediately after installation, open Device
Manager and verify that no error icons are displayed.
Next, check the physical device. Finally, test the
device’s functionality.
Troubleshooting Expansion Cards
■
If you find a device is not working as expected,
your first step is to check Device Manager. If the
device is not listed in Device Manager, verify that
you inserted it correctly and it has power. You can
also try the Add Hardware Wizard to see if
Windows recognizes the device.
■
A good tech is familiar with Device Manager’s
trouble icons. A black “!” on a yellow circle
indicates that the device is missing, the device is
not recognized, or there is a problem with the
driver. A device may still work even when
displaying this icon. A red “X” indicates a disabled
device and usually means the device has been
turned off or is damaged. A device with a red “X”
will not work. A blue “i” on a white circle indicates
that system resources have been configured
manually. This icon is informational and does not
imply any error.
■
If you encounter the “!” icon, verify the device’s
connections. Next, try to reinstall the driver by
right-clicking the device in Device Manager and
selecting Properties. Click the Driver tab and then
click the Update Driver button.
■
If a device displays the red “X” icon, right-click the
device in Device Manager and select Enable. If that
doesn’t work, try rolling back or uninstalling the
driver. Shut down the system, verify the device’s
connections, and repeat the installation procedure. If
the device still doesn’t work, it is likely the device is
either bad or not compatible with your operating
system. Return the card to the place of purchase.

■Upgrading and Installing
Motherboards
To most techs, the concept of adding or replacing a motherboard can be ex-
tremely intimidating. It really shouldn’t be; motherboard installation is a
common and necessary part of PC repair. It is inexpensive and easy, al-
though it can sometimes be a little tedious and messy due to the large num-
ber of parts involved. This section covers the process of installation and
replacement and will show you some of the tricks that make this necessary
process easy to handle.
IT Technician
Choosing the Motherboard and Case
Choosing a motherboard and case can prove quite a challenge for any tech,
whether newly minted or a seasoned veteran. You first have to figure out
the type of motherboard you want, such as AMD- or Intel-based. Then you
need to think about the form factor , which determines the physical size of
the motherboard as well as the general location of components and ports.
Third, how rich in features is the motherboard and how tough is it to config-
ure? You’ve got to read the motherboard manual to find out! Finally, you
need to select the case that matches your space needs, budget, and form fac-
tor. Let’s look at each step in a little more detail.
First, determine what motherboard you need. What CPU are you using?
Will the motherboard work with that CPU? Because most of us buy the CPU
and the motherboard at the same time, make the seller guarantee that the
CPU will work with the motherboard. If you can, choose a motherboard that
works with much higher speeds than the CPU you can afford; that way you
can upgrade later. How much RAM do you intend to install? Are extra RAM
sockets available for future upgrades?

Being able to select and in-
stall a motherboard appropriate
for a client or customer is some-
thing every CompTIA A+ techni-
cian should know. This is
particularly important if you’re
studying for the CompTIA A+
220-604 Depot Technician exam,
but less so for those working to-
ward the CompTIA A+ 220-603
Help Desk Technician exam.

A number of excellent motherboard manufacturers are available today.
Some of the more popular brands are Abit, Asus, Biostar, DFI, Gigabyte,
Intel, MSI, and Shuttle. Your supplier may also have some lesser-known but
perfectly acceptable brands of motherboards. As long as the supplier has an
easy return policy, it’s perfectly fine to try one of these.

Try This!
Building a Recommendation
Family, friends, and potential clients often solicit the advice of a tech
when they’re thinking about upgrading their PC. This solicitation puts
you on the spot to make not just any old recommendation, but one that
works with the needs and budget of the potential upgrader. To do this
successfully, you need to manage expectations and ask the right
questions, so Try This!
1.
What does the upgrader want to do that compels him or her to
upgrade? Write it down! Some of the common motivations for
upgrading are to play that hot new game or to take advantage of
new technology. What’s the minimum system needed to run
tomorrow’s action games? What do you need to make
multimedia sing? Does the motherboard need to have FireWire
and high-speed USB built in to accommodate digital video and
better printers?
2.
How much of the current system does the upgrader want to
save? Upgrading a motherboard can very quickly turn into a
complete system rebuild. How old is the case? If it’s an AT case,
you pretty much need to look at a full computer replacement,
but if it’s a generic ATX case, you can usually save that much.
On the other hand, if you want to use front-mounted USB and
FireWire ports, then you’ll want a new case as well. You’ll most
likely want to replace the CPU, so your first decision is AMD vs.
Intel. The former gives you more bang for the buck, but the
latter offers peace of mind for non-techs. What about RAM? Do
you stick with the SDRAM or DDR SDRAM currently in the PC
and go for a lower-end board that supports the older technology,
or buy a board that uses DDR2? Do you go for a motherboard
that supports AGP—and thus keep the current video card—or
go for a PCI Express board that will require a new video card
as well?
3.
Once you’ve gathered information on motivation and assessed
the current PC of the upgrader, it’s time to get down to business:
field trip time! This is a great excuse to get to the computer store
and check out the latest motherboards and gadgets. Don’t forget
to jot down notes and prices while you’re there! By the end of
the field trip, you should have the information to give the
upgrader an honest assessment of what an upgrade will entail,
at least in monetary terms. Be honest—in other words, don’t just
tell the upgrader what you think he or she wants to hear—and
you won’t get in trouble!

Second, make sure you’re getting a form factor that
works with your case. Don’t try to put a regular ATX
motherboard into a microATX case!
Third, all motherboards come with a technical manual,
better known as the motherboard book (Figure 6.1). You
must have this book! This book is your primary source for
all of the critical information about the motherboard. If
you set up CPU or RAM timings incorrectly in CMOS, for
example, and you have a dead PC, where would you find
the CMOS clear jumper? Where do you plug in the
speaker? Even if you let someone else install the mother-
board, insist on the motherboard book; you will need it.
Fourth, pick your case carefully. Cases come in six ba-
sic sizes: slimline, desktop, mini-tower, mid-tower, tower,
and cube. Slimline and desktop models generally sit on the
desk, beneath the monitor. The various tower cases usu-
ally occupy a bit of floor space next to the desk. The
mini-tower and mid-tower cases are the most popular
choices. Make sure you get a case that will fit your mother-
board—many microATX and all FlexATX cases are too
small for a regular ATX motherboard. Cube cases generally require a spe-
cific motherboard, so be prepared to buy both pieces at once. A quick test fit
before you buy saves a lot of return trips to the supplier.
Cases come with many different options, but three more common op-
tions point to a better case. One option is a removable face (Figure 6.2)—
many cheaper cases will screw the face into the metal frame using wood
screws. A removable face makes disassembly much easier by offering mov-
able tabs that hold the face in place rather than screws.
Another option is a detachable motherboard mount. Clearly, the moth-
erboard will have to be attached to the case in some fashion. In better cases,
this is handled by a removable tray or plate called a motherboard mount

Tech Tip
Replacement
Motherboard Books
If you have a motherboard with
no manual, you can usually find
a copy of the manual in Adobe
Acrobat (.pdf) format online at
the manufacturer’s Web site. It’s
a good idea to grab and print a
copy to keep with the mother-
board. I often tape a copy (either
hard copy or burned onto a CD)
of the manual inside the case
where I installed the mother-
board. Just don’t cover any vents!
• Figure 6.1
Motherboard box and book
• Figure 6.2
Removable face

(Figure 6.3). This enables you to attach the motherboard to the case sepa-
rately, saving you from the chore of sticking your arms into the case to turn
screws.
The third option, front-mounted ports for USB, FireWire, and
headphones, can make using a PC much easier. Better cases offer these
ports, although you can also get add-on components that fit into the
increasingly useless floppy drive bay to bring added front connectivity to
the PC. Figure 6.4 shows a case with both types of front connectors.
Power supplies often come with the case. Watch out for “really good
deal” cases because that invariably points to a cheap or missing power sup-
ply. You also need to verify that the power supply has sufficient wattage.
Installing the Motherboard
If you’re replacing a motherboard, first remove the old motherboard. Begin
by removing all the cards. Also remove anything else that might impede re-
moval or installation of the motherboard, such as hard or floppy drives.
Keep track of your screws—the best idea is to return the screws to their
mounting holes temporarily, at least until you can reinstall the parts. Some-
times even the power supply has to be removed temporarily to enable ac-
cess to the motherboard. Document the position of the little wires for the
speaker, power switch, and reset button in case you need to reinstall them.
Unscrew the motherboard. It will not simply lift out. The motherboard
mounts to the case via small connectors called standouts that slide into
keyed slots or screw into the bottom of the case (Figure 6.5). Screws then go
into the standouts to hold the motherboard in place. Be sure to place the
standouts properly before installing the new motherboard.
When you insert the new motherboard, do not assume that you will put the
screws and standouts in the same place as they were in your old motherboard.
When it comes to the placement of screws and standouts, only one rule applies:
76
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
Watch out for ESD here! Re-
member that it’s very easy to
damage or destroy a CPU and
RAM with a little electrostatic
discharge. It’s also fairly easy to
damage the motherboard with
ESD. Wear your anti-static wrist
strap!
• Figure 6.3
Motherboard tray

Case with both front-
mounted ports and an

anywhere it fits. Do not be afraid to be a little tough here! Installing mother-
boards can be a wiggling, twisting, knuckle-scraping process.
Once you get the motherboard mounted in the case with the CPU and
RAM properly installed, it’s time to insert the power connections and test it.
A POST card , which can be inserted in an available expansion slot to display
any POST errors, can be helpful with the system test because you won’t
have to add the speaker, a video card, monitor, and keyboard to verify that
the system is booting. If you have a POST card, start the system and watch to
see if the POST takes place—you should see a number of POST codes before
the POST stops. If you don’t have a POST card, install a keyboard, speaker,
video card, and monitor. Boot the system and see if the BIOS information
shows up on the screen. If it does, you’re probably okay. If it doesn’t, it’s
time to refer to the motherboard book to see where a mistake was made.
Wires, Wires, Wires
The last, and often the most frustrating, part of motherboard installation is
connecting the LEDs, buttons, and front-mounted ports on the front of the
box. These usually include the following:
■
Soft power
■
Reset button
■
Speaker
■
Hard drive activity LED
■
Power LED

Tech Tip
Before the Case
A lot of techs install the CPU,
CPU fan, and RAM into the
motherboard before installing the
motherboard into the case. This
helps in several ways, especially
with a new system. First, you
want to make certain that the
CPU and RAM work well with
the motherboard and with each
other—without that, you have no
hope of setting up a stable system.
Second, installing these compo-
nents first prevents the phenome-
non of flexing the motherboard.
Some cases don’t provide quite
enough support for the mother-
board, and pushing in RAM can
make the board bend. Third, at-
taching a CPU fan can be a bear
of a task, one that’s considerably
easier to do on a table top than
within the confines of a case.
Finally, on motherboards that
require you to set jumpers or
switches, it’s much easier to read
the tiny information stenciled on
the PCB before you add the shad-
ows from the case! If necessary,
set any jumpers and switches for
the specific CPU according to
information from the
motherboard manual.
Pay attention to the location
of the standouts if you’re swap-
ping a motherboard. If you leave
a screw-type standout beneath a
spot on the motherboard where
you can’t add a screw and then
apply power to the mother-
board, you run the risk of short-
ing the motherboard.

These
wires
have
specific
pin
connections
to
the
motherboard. Although you can refer to the motherboard book
for their location, usually a quick inspection of the motherboard
will suffice for an experienced tech (Figure 6.6).
A few rules need to be followed when installing these wires.
First, the lights are LEDs, not light bulbs—they have a positive
and negative side. If they don’t work one way, turn the connec-
tor around and try the other. Second, when in doubt, guess. In-
correct installation only results in the device not working; it
won’t damage the computer. Refer to the motherboard book for
the correct installation. The third and last rule is that with the ex-
ception of the soft power switch on an ATX system, you do not
need any of these wires for the computer to run! Many techs of-
ten simply ignore these wires, although this would not be some-
thing I’d do to any system but my own!
No hard-and-fast rule exists for determining the function of
each wire. Often the function of each wire is printed on the con-
nector (Figure 6.7). If not, track each wire to the LED or switch to
determine its function.
■Troubleshooting Motherboards
Motherboards fail. Not often, but motherboards and motherboard compo-
nents can die from many causes: time, dust, cat hair, or simply slight manu-
facturing defects made worse by the millions of amps of current sluicing
through the motherboard traces. Installing cards, electrostatic discharge,
flexing the motherboard one time too many when swapping out RAM or
drives—any of these factors can cause a motherboard to fail. The mother-
board is a hard-working, often abused component of the PC! Unfortunately

Sample of case wires

for the common tech, troubleshooting a motherboard problem can be very
difficult and time-consuming. This chapter concludes with a look at symp-
toms of a failing motherboard, techniques for troubleshooting, and the
options you have when you discover a motherboard problem.
Symptoms
Motherboard failures commonly fall into three types: catastrophic, compo-
nent, and ethereal. With a catastrophic failure , the PC just won’t boot. This
sort of problem happens with brand-new systems due to manufacturing de-
fects—often called a burn-in failure —and to any system that gets a shock of
electrostatic discharge. Burn-in failure is uncommon, but usually happens
in the first 30 days of use. Swap out the motherboard for a replacement and
you should be fine. If you accidentally zap your motherboard when insert-
ing a card or moving wires around, be chagrined. Change your daring ways
and wear an anti-static wrist strap!
Component failure happens rarely, but appears as flaky connections be-
tween a device and motherboard, or as intermittent problems. A hard drive
plugged into a faulty controller on the motherboard, for example, might
show up in CMOS autodetect, but be inaccessible in Windows. A serial con-
troller that worked fine for months until a big storm took out the external
modem hooked to it, but doesn’t work anymore, even with a replacement
modem, is another example.
The most difficult of the three types of symptoms to diagnose are those I
call ethereal symptoms. Stuff just doesn’t work all the time. The PC reboots
itself. You get blue screens of death in the midst of heavy computing, like
right before you smack the villain and rescue the damsel. What can cause
such symptoms? If you answered any of the following, you win the prize:
■
Faulty component
■
Buggy device driver
■

Err…you get the picture.
What a nightmare scenario to troubleshoot! The Way of the Tech knows
paths through such perils, though, so let’s turn to troubleshooting tech-
niques now.
Techniques
To troubleshoot a potential motherboard failure requires time, patience,
and organization. Some problems will certainly be quicker to solve than oth-
ers. If the hard drive doesn’t work as expected, as in the example above,
check the settings on the drive. Try a different drive. Try the same drive with
a different motherboard to verify that it’s a good drive. Like every other
troubleshooting technique, all you try to do with motherboard testing is to
isolate the problem by eliminating potential factors.

If you’re studying for the
CompTIA A+ 220-604 Depot
Tech exam, pay particular atten-
tion to the techniques for trou-
bleshooting motherboards.

This three-part system—check, replace, verify good component—works
for the simpler and the more complicated motherboard problems. You can
even apply the same technique to ethereal-type problems that might be any-
thing, but you should add one more verb: document. Take notes on the indi-
vidual components tested so you don’t repeat efforts or waste time. Plus,
this can lead to the establishment of patterns. Being able to re-create a sys-
tem crash by performing certain actions in a specific order can often lead
you to the root of the problem. Document your actions. Motherboard testing
is time-consuming enough without adding inefficiency!
Options
Once you determine that the motherboard has problems, you have several
options for fixing the three types of failures. If you have a catastrophic fail-
ure, you must replace the motherboard. Even if it works somewhat, don’t
mess around. The motherboard should provide bedrock stability for the
system. If it’s even remotely buggy or problematic, get rid of it!
If you have a component failure, you can often replace the component
with an add-on card that will be as good as or better than the failed device.
Promise Technology, for example, makes fine hard drive controller cards
that can replace one or both hard drive controllers on the motherboard
(Figure 6.8).
If your component failure is more a technology issue rather than
physical damage, then you can try upgrading the BIOS on the motherboard.
80
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
If you’ve lost components
due to ESD or a power surge,
then you would most likely be
better off replacing the mother-
board. The damage you can’t
see can definitely sneak up to
bite you and create system
instability.
Tech Tip
Limits of BIOS
Upgrades
Flashing the BIOS for a mother-
board can fix a lot of system sta-
bility problems and provide better
implementation of built-in tech-
nology. What it cannot do for
your system is improve the hard-
ware. If AMD comes out with a
new, improved, lower-voltage
Athlon 64, for example, and your
motherboard cannot scale down
the voltage properly, then you
cannot use that CPU—even if it
fits in your motherboard’s Socket
AM2. No amount of BIOS flash-
ing can change the hardware
built into your motherboard.
• Figure 6.8
Promise Technology PCI hard drive controller card

Every motherboard comes with a
small set of code that enables the
CPU to communicate properly with
the devices built into the mother-
board. You can quite readily up-
grade this programming by flashing
the BIOS : running a small command-
line program to write new BIOS in
the flash ROM chip. Figure 6.9
shows a couple of typical flash
ROMs. Refer back to Chapter 4 for
the details on flashing.
Finally, if you have an ethereal,
ghost-in-the-machine type of prob-
lem that you have finally deter-
mined to be motherboard related,
you have only a couple of options
for fixing the problem. You can
flash the BIOS in a desperate at-
tempt to correct whatever it is,
which sometimes does work and is
less expensive than the other op-
tion.
Or,
you
can
replace
the
motherboard.

Many companies followed Shut-

hear these cases commonly re-
ferred to as small form factor

wide standard. Some SFF cases

case with a proprietary power supply. Originally, these systems were sold
barebones, meaning they came with only a motherboard, case, and power sup-

itor. Shuttle now produces a full line of computers.
Mini-ITX
If you really want to get small, check out Mini-ITX (Figure 6.11). Developed
by VIA Technologies in 2001, Mini-ITX has a maximum size of only 17 centi-
meters by 17 centimeters! These tiny systems only use the VIA C3 family of
CPUs, so if you want to get really picky, Mini-ITX is a proprietary computer
system, not really a form factor. Mini-ITX also has its own tiny power sup-
ply standard. The low power requirements don’t require a fan on some sys-
tems. The VIA C3 CPUs aren’t as powerful as the latest offerings from Intel
and AMD, but they’re great for specialized jobs such as home theater sys-
tems or manufacturing.

Chapter 6 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
installing and troubleshooting motherboards.
Upgrading and Installing Motherboards
■
Not all motherboards fit in all cases. If you
upgrade a motherboard, make sure the new
motherboard fits in the existing case. If you
purchase a new motherboard and a new case,
make sure you purchase a case that supports the
form factor of your motherboard.
■
Determine the CPU you or your client wants before
purchasing a motherboard. Not all CPUs are
supported by, or even fit in, all motherboards.
Make sure your motherboard supports your CPU
and, if possible, purchase a motherboard that
supports higher speeds than your CPU in case you
want to upgrade the processor at a later time.
■
To replace a motherboard, first remove all the
expansion cards from the old motherboard.
Document the position of all the little wires before
removing them. Unscrew the motherboard and
remove it from the case.
■
Before installing a new motherboard in the case,
attach the CPU, heat sink/fan, and RAM. Check
the standouts in the case—you might have to add
or remove a few to accommodate the new
motherboard. Once installed, boot the system and
make sure there are no POST errors and the BIOS
information appears on the screen. Then install any
expansion cards.
■
Cases come with a series of little wires that connect
to LEDs on the front of the case. These wires need
to be plugged in to the motherboard for the LEDs
to function. LEDs have a positive and a negative
side, so the wires must be connected the right way
or the LEDs will not work. If you find the LEDs are
not working, turn the connector around to reverse
the positive/negative connection. Getting it wrong
will not damage your system—it will only cause
the LEDs not to light up.
Troubleshooting Motherboards
■
Motherboards and motherboard components can
die for many reasons including time, dust, pet hair,
manufacturing defects, ESD, or physical damage.
Motherboard failures usually fall into one of three
main categories: catastrophic, component, or
ethereal.
■
Catastrophic failure is typically caused by
manufacturing defects (burn-in failure) or ESD.
Burn-in failures are uncommon and usually
manifest within the first 30 days of use. In the case
of a catastrophic failure, replace the motherboard.
■
Component failure appears as a flaky connection
between a device and the motherboard or as
intermittent problems. In the case of a component
failure, replace the failed component with an
expansion card or peripheral device. Sometimes a
BIOS upgrade can fix component failures.
■
Ethereal failure is the most difficult to diagnose.
Symptoms vary from the PC rebooting itself to
blue screens of death and can be caused by a faulty
component, buggy device driver, buggy
application software, operating system corruption,
or power supply problems.
■
Use three steps to troubleshoot problems: check,
replace, and verify. For example, first check the
settings of the problem device. If the device still
fails, replace the device. If the device continues to
malfunction, try the device with a different
motherboard. Remember to document your
troubleshooting steps. Not only will it help you to
become an efficient troubleshooter, but it can lead
to the establishment of patterns. Being able to
re-create a system crash by performing certain
actions in a specific order can often lead you to the
root of the problem.

Lab Projects
• Lab Project 6.1
You know now how important the motherboard
chipset is in determining the kind of CPU and RAM
that can be installed in the computer. You also know
that motherboards that may look similar may have
very different features and prices. Imagine that you
are going to build a new computer by ordering the
components. Price is not a problem, so you will want
to select the best and most powerful components. On
the Internet, search such sites as www.intel.com or
www.amd.com along with sites such as www
.newegg.com to select a motherboard and a
particular chipset. Then select a compatible CPU and
RAM. Explain where you found the information
about the components, what brands/models you
selected, and how much each will cost.
Now imagine that your budget will not allow you
to buy these components at this time. In fact, you’ve
decided that you can afford only 75 percent of the
cost of these components. What will you do to save
money? Will you change the motherboard and the
chipset or will you use a less powerful CPU with a
smaller amount of RAM? Consider what you can
upgrade at a later time when you have more
available cash. Again, search the Internet and select
components that would be satisfactory but are not
the latest and the greatest. Be sure that the CPU and
RAM you select are indeed compatible with your
motherboard and chipset. What did you select and
how much will it cost you?

■Installing, Maintaining, and
Troubleshooting Power Supplies
Installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting power supplies take a little less
math than selecting the proper power supply for a system but remain essen-
tial skills for any tech. Installing takes but a
moment, and maintaining is almost as sim-
ple, but troubleshooting can cause head-
aches. Let’s take a look.
Installing
The typical power supply, also known as
the power supply unit (PSU) , connects to
the
PC
with
four
standard
computer
screws, mounted in the back of the case
(Figure 7.1). Unscrew the four screws and
the power supply lifts out easily (Figure 7.2).
Insert a new power supply that fits the case
and attach it using the same four screws.
Handling ATX power supplies requires
special consideration. Understand that an

Mounting screws for power supply

ATX power supply never turns off. As long as
that power supply stays connected to a power
outlet, the power supply will continue to supply
5 volts to the motherboard. Always unplug an
ATX system before you do any work! For years,
techs bickered about the merits of leaving a PC
plugged in or unplugged while you serviced it.
ATX settled this issue forever. Many ATX
power supplies provide a real on/off switch on
the back of the PSU (see Figure 7.3). If you really
need the system shut down with no power to
the motherboard, use this switch.
When working on an ATX system, you may
find using the power button inconvenient be-
cause you’re not using a case or you haven’t
bothered to plug the power button’s leads into
the motherboard. That means there is no power
button! One trick you can use when in that situ-
ation is to use a set of car keys or a screwdriver
to contact the two wires to start and stop the
system (see Figure 7.4).
Your first task after acquiring a new power supply is simply
making sure it works. Insert the motherboard power connectors
before starting the system. If you have video cards with power con-
nectors, plug them in, too. Other connectors such as hard drives
can wait until you’ve got one successful boot⎯or if you’re cocky,
just plug everything in!
Cooling
Heat and computers are not the best of friends. Cooling is therefore
a vital consideration when building a computer. Electricity equals
heat. Computers, being electrical devices, generate heat as they

operate, and too much can seriously damage a
computer’s internal components.
The power supply fan (Figure 7.5) provides the
basic cooling for the PC. It not only cools the voltage
regulator circuits within the power supply, but it also
provides a constant flow of outside air throughout
the interior of the computer case. A dead power sup-
ply fan can rapidly cause tremendous problems, even
equipment failure. If you ever turn on a computer and
it boots just fine, but you notice that it seems unusu-
ally quiet, check to see if the power supply fan has
died. If it has, quickly turn off the PC and replace the
power supply.
Some power supplies come with a built-in sensor
to help regulate the airflow. If the system gets too hot,
the power supply fan spins faster. The 3-pin, 3-wire
fan sensor connector plugs into the motherboard
directly (Figure 7.6).
Case fans (Figure 7.7) are large, square fans that
snap into special brackets on the case or screw di-
rectly to the case, providing extra cooling for key
components. Most cases come with a case fan, and no
modern computer should really be without one or
two.
The single biggest issue related to case fans is
where to plug them in. Most case fans come with
standard Molex connectors (the large, 4-pin connec-
tors that power IDE hard drives and CD/DVD
drives), which are easy to plug in, but other case fans
come with special three-pronged power connectors
that need to connect to the motherboard. You can get
adapters to plug three-pronged connectors into
Molex connectors or Molex connectors into three-
pronged connectors.

Maintaining Airflow
A computer is a closed system and computer cases help the fans keep things
cool: everything is inside a box. Although many tech types like to run their
systems with the side panel of the case open for easy access to the compo-
nents, in the end they are cheating themselves. Why? A closed case enables
the fans to create airflow. This airflow substantially cools off interior com-
ponents. When the side of the case is open, you ruin the airflow of the sys-
tem, and you lose a lot of cooling efficiency.
An important point to remember when implementing good airflow in-
side your computer case is that hot air rises. Warm air always rises above
cold air, and you can use this principle to your advantage in keeping your
computer cool.
In the typical layout of case fans for a computer case, an intake fan is lo-
cated near the bottom of the front bezel of the case. This fan draws cool air in
from outside the case and blows it over the components inside the case.
Near the top and rear of the case (usually near the power supply), you’ll
usually find an exhaust fan. This fan works the opposite of the intake fan: it
takes the warm air from inside the case and sends it to the outside.
Another important part of maintaining proper airflow inside the case is
ensuring that all empty expansion bays are covered by
slot covers
(Figure 7.8). To maintain good airflow inside your case, you shouldn’t
provide too many opportunities for air to escape. Slot covers not only assist in
maintaining a steady airflow; they help keep dust and smoke out of your case.
Reducing Fan Noise
Fans generate noise. In an effort to ensure proper cooling, many techs put
several high-speed fans into a case, making the PC sound like a jet engine.
You can reduce fan noise by getting manually adjustable-speed fans, larger
fans, or specialty “quiet” fans. Many motherboards enable you to control
fans through software.
Missing slot covers can cause
the PC to overheat!
• Figure 7.8
Slot covers

Manually adjustable fans have a little knob you can turn to speed up or
slow down the fan (Figure 7.9). This kind of fan can reduce some of the
noise, but you run the risk of slowing down the fan too much and thus let-
ting the interior of the case heat up. A better solution is to get quieter fans.
Larger fans that spin slower are another way to reduce noise while
maintaining good airflow. Fans sizes are measured in millimeters (mm) or
centimeters (cm). Traditionally, the industry used 80-mm power supply
and cooling fans, but today you’ll find 100-mm, 120-mm, and even larger
fans in power supplies and cases.
Many companies manufacture and sell higher-end, low-noise fans. The
fans have better bearings than the run-of-the-mill fans, so they cost a little
more, but they’re definitely worth it. They market these fans as “quiet” or
“silencer,” or other similar adjectives. If you run into a PC that sounds like a
jet, try swapping out the case fans for a low-decibel fan from Papst,
Panasonic, or Cooler Master. Just check the decibel rating to decide which
one to get. Lower, of course, is better.
Because the temperature inside a PC changes depending on the load put
on the PC, the best solution for noise reduction combines a good set of fans
with temperature sensors to speed up or slow down the fans automatically.
A PC at rest will use less than half of the power of a PC running a video-
intensive computer game and therefore makes a lot less heat. Virtually all
modern systems support three fans through three 3-pin fan connectors on
the motherboard. The CPU fan uses one of these connectors, but the other
two are for system fans or the power supply fan.
Most CMOS setup utilities provide a little control over fans plugged into
the motherboard. Figure 7.10 shows a typical CMOS setting for the fans. Note
that there’s no way to tell the fans when to come on or off⎯only when to set off
an alarm when they reach a certain temperature.
Software is the best way to control your fans. Some motherboards come
with system monitoring software that enables you to set the temperature at
which you want the fans to come on and off. If no program came with your

Web site doesn’t offer one for download,
try the popular freeware SpeedFan utility
(Figure 7.11), written by Alfredo Milani
Comparetti, that monitors voltages, fan
speeds, and temperatures in computers
with hardware monitor chips. SpeedFan
can even access S.M.A.R.T. information
for hard disks that support this feature
and shows hard disk temperatures too, if
supported. You can find SpeedFan at
www.almico.com/speedfan.php.
Even if you don’t want to mess with
your fans, always make a point to turn on
your temperature alarms in CMOS. If the
system gets too hot, an alarm will warn
you. There’s no way to know if a fan dies
other than to have an alarm.
When Power Supplies Die
Power supplies fail in two ways: sudden death and slowly over time.
When they die suddenly, the computer will not start and the fan in
the power supply will not turn. In this case, verify that electricity is
getting to the power supply before you do anything! Avoid the
embarrassment of trying to repair a power supply when the only
problem is a bad outlet or an extension cord that is not plugged in.
Assuming that the system has electricity, the best way to verify that a
power
supply
is
working
or
not
working
is
to
check
the
voltages coming out of the power supply with a multimeter (see
Figure 7.12).
Do not panic if your power supply puts out slightly more or less
voltage than its nominal value. The voltages supplied by most PC
power supplies can safely vary by as much as ±10 percent of their
stated values. This means that the 12-volt line can vary from roughly

10.5 to 12.9 volts without exceeding the tolerance of the various systems in
the PC. The 5.0- and 3.3-volt lines offer similar tolerances.
Be sure to test every connection on the power supply—that means every
connection on your main power as well as every Molex and mini. Because
all voltages are between –20 and +20 VDC, simply set the voltmeter to the
20-V DC setting for everything. If the power supply fails to provide power,
throw it into the recycling bin and get a new one⎯even if you’re a compo-
nent expert and a whiz with a soldering iron. Don’t waste your or your com-
pany’s time; the price of new power supplies makes replacement the
obvious way to go.

Power supplies will not start unless they’re con-
nected to a motherboard, so what do you do if you
don’t have a motherboard you trust to test? First, try
an ATX tester . Many companies make these devices.
Look for one that supports both 20- and 24-pin moth-
erboard connectors as well as all of the other connec-
tors on your motherboard. Figure 7.13 shows a power
supply tester.
Switches
Broken power switches form an occasional source of
problems for power supplies that fail to start. The
power switch is behind the on/off button on every
PC. It is usually secured to the front cover or inside
front frame on your PC, making it a rather challeng-
ing part to access. To test, try shorting the soft power
jumpers as described earlier. A key or screwdriver
will do the trick.
When Power Supplies Die Slowly
If all power supplies died suddenly, this would be a much shorter chapter.
Unfortunately, the majority of PC problems occur when power supplies die
slowly over time. This means that one of the internal electronics of the
power supply has begun to fail. The failures are always intermittent and tend
to cause some of the most difficult to diagnose problems in PC repair. The
secret to discovering that a power supply is dying lies in one word: intermit-
tent. Whenever you experience intermittent problems, your first guess
should be that the power supply is bad. Here are some other clues you may
hear from users:
■
“Whenever I start my computer in the morning, it starts to boot, and
then locks up. If I press CTRL-ALT-DEL two or three times, then it will
boot up fine.”
■
“Sometimes when I start my PC, I get an error code. If I reboot it
goes away. Sometimes I get different errors.”
■
“My computer will run fine for an hour or so. Then it locks up,
sometimes once or twice an hour.”

Many CMOS utilities and
software programs monitor
voltage, saving you the hassle
of using a multimeter.
• Figure 7.13
ATX power supply tester

Sometimes something bad happens and sometimes it does not. That’s the
clue for replacing the power supply. And don’t bother with the voltmeter; the
voltages will show up within tolerances, but only once in a while they will
spike and sag (far more quickly than your voltmeter can measure) and cause
these intermittent errors. When in doubt, change the power supply. Power
supplies break in computers more often than any other part of the PC except
the floppy disk drives. You might choose to keep power supplies on hand
for swapping and testing.
Fuses and Fire
Inside every power supply resides a simple fuse. If your power supply sim-
ply pops and stops working, you might be tempted to go inside the power
supply and check the fuse. This is not a good idea. First off, the capacitors in
most power supplies carry high voltage charges that can hurt a lot if you
touch them. Second, fuses blow for a reason. If a power supply is malfunc-
tioning inside, you want that fuse to blow, because the alternative is much
less desirable.
Failure to respect the power of electricity will eventually result in the
most catastrophic of all situations: a fire. Don’t think it won’t happen to you!
Keep a fire extinguisher handy. Every PC workbench needs a fire extin-
guisher, but you need to make sure you have the right one. The fire preven-
tion industry has divided fire extinguishers into three fire classes:
■
Class A
Ordinary free-burning combustible, such as wood or
paper
■
Class B
Flammable liquids, such as gasoline, solvents, or paint
■
Class C
Live electrical equipment
As you might expect, you should only use a Class C fire extinguisher on
your PC if it should catch fire. All fire extinguishers are required to have
their type labeled prominently on them. Many fire extinguishers are
multi-class in that they can handle more than one type of fire. The most com-
mon fire extinguisher is type ABC—it works on all common types of fires.
Beyond A+
Power supplies provide essential services for the PC, creating DC out of AC
and cooling the system, but that utilitarian role does not stop the power sup-
ply from being an enthusiast’s plaything. Plus, server and high-end
workstations have somewhat different needs than more typical systems, so
naturally they need a boost in power. Let’s take a look Beyond A+ at these
issues.
It Glows!
The enthusiast community has been modifying, or modding, their PCs for
years, cutting holes in the cases, adding fans to make overclocking feasible,
and slapping in glowing strips of neon and cold cathode tubes. The power

supply escaped the scene for a while, but it’s back. A quick visit to a good
computer store off or online, such as Directron.com, reveals a line of power
supplies that light up, sport a fancy color, or have more fans than some rock
stars. Figure 7.14 shows a see-through PSU.
On the other hand, you also find super-quiet stealth power supplies
(Figure 7.15), with single or double high-end fans that react to the tempera-
ture inside your PC—speeding up when necessary but running slowly and
silently when not. One of these would make a perfect power supply for a
home entertainment PC, because it would provide function without adding
excessive decibels of noise.
Modular Power Supplies
It’s getting more and more popular to make PCs that look good on both the
inside and the outside. Unused power cables dangling around inside PCs

creates a not-so-pretty picture. To
help out stylish people, manufac-
turers created power supplies with
modular cables (Figure 7.16).
Modular cables are pretty cool,
because you add only the lines you
need for your system. On the other
hand, some techs claim that modu-
lar cables hurt efficiency because
the modular connectors add resis-
tance to the lines. You make the
choice: is a slight reduction in effi-
ciency worth a pretty look?
Rail Power
When you start using more power-
ful CPUs and video cards, you can
run into a problem I call “rail
power.” Every ATX12V power sup-
ply using multiple rails supplies only a cer-
tain amount of power, measured in amps
(A), on each rail. The problem is with the
12-V rails. The ATX12V standard requires
up to 18 A for each 12-V rail—more than
enough for the majority of users, but not
enough when you’re using a powerful CPU
and one or more PCIe video cards. If you’ve
got a powerful system, get online and read
the detailed specs for your power supply.
Figure 7.17 shows sample power supply
specs. Many power supply makers do not
release detailed specs⎯avoid them!
Look for power supplies that offer about
16 to 18 A per rail. These will be big power
supplies⎯400 W and up. Nothing less will
support a big CPU and one or two PCIe
video cards.
Watch out for power supplies that list
their operating temperature at 25º C—about
room temperature. A power supply that
provides 500 W at 25º C will supply substan-
tially less in warmer temperatures, and the
inside of your PC is usually 15º C warmer
than the outside air. Sadly, many power sup-
ply makers⎯even those who make good
power supplies⎯fudge this fact.

Chapter 7 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
installing and troubleshooting power supplies.
Install and Upgrade Power Supplies
■
Power supplies connect to the PC case via four
screws mounted in the rear of the case. Unscrew
the four screws and the power supply will lift out.
As ATX power supplies are always on, be sure to
unplug it from the wall outlet before working on it.
Understand and Implement System Cooling
■
Adequate cooling is important to prevent damage
to the computer’s internal components. The fan
inside the power supply itself cools the voltage
regulator circuits within the power supply and
provides a constant flow of outside air throughout
the interior of the computer case. If the fan is not
working, turn the computer off before you
experience equipment failure. Some power
supplies regulate airflow by using a sensor, with a
three-wire connector that plugs into the
motherboard.
■
To improve cooling, most cases come with a case fan.
If the case does not have one, you should add one.
Most case fans use standard Molex connectors, but
some use a special three-pronged power connector
that plugs directly into the motherboard. To enable
the fans to create airflow, the case needs to be closed.
If slot covers are left off empty expansion bays, it can
cause the computer to overheat. Slot covers also help
keep dust and smoke out of the case. Beware of
“great deals” on cases that come with power
supplies, as the included power supply is often
substandard.
Troubleshoot Power Supplies
■
Electrical problems range from irregular AC to dying
or faulty power supplies. Power supplies may fail
suddenly or slowly over time. After you make sure
that the wall outlet is providing electricity, checking
voltages from the power supply with a voltmeter is
the best way to verify that the power supply is
working or has failed. A power supply is functioning
properly if the output voltages are within 10 percent
over or under the expected voltage. Be sure to check
all the connections on the power supply. If you
determine that it is bad, the most economical solution
is to throw it away and replace it with a new one.
■
Power supplies will not start unless they are
connected to a motherboard. If you need to test a
power supply but don’t have a motherboard, use
an ATX tester.
■
If one of the internal electrical components in the
power supply begins to fail, the result is usually
intermittent problems, making it difficult to
diagnose. If you are experiencing intermittent
problems, such as lockups or different error codes
that disappear after rebooting, suspect the power
supply. Unfortunately, the voltmeter is not good
for diagnosing intermittent problems. Since power
supply failures rank second behind floppy drive
failures, it is a good idea to keep power supplies in
stock for swapping and testing.
■
Never open a power supply, even to check the
fuse, because the unit contains capacitors that carry
high voltage charges that can hurt you.
■
Every PC workbench should have a Class C fire
extinguisher handy in case of an electrical fire.
Although some fire extinguishers are multi-class,
handling all types of fire, use only a Class C fire
extinguisher on your PC.

O
f all the hardware on a PC, none gets more attention—or gives more
anguish—than the hard drive. There’s a good reason for this: if the hard
drive breaks, you lose data. As you probably know, when the data goes, you
have to redo work or restore from backup—or worse. It’s good to worry about
the data, because the data runs the office, maintains the payrolls, and stores the
e-mail. This level of concern is so strong that even the most neophyte PC users
are exposed to terms such as IDE, ATA, and controller—even if they don’t put
the terms into practice!
This chapter focuses on how hard drives work, beginning with the internal
layout and organization of the hard drive. You’ll look at the different types of
hard drives used today (PATA, SATA, and SCSI), how they interface with the
PC, and how to install them properly into a system. The chapter covers how
more than one drive may work with other drives to provide data safety and
improve speed through a feature called RAID. Let’s get started.

■How Hard Drives Work
All hard drives are composed of individual disks, or platters, with read/
write heads on actuator arms controlled by a servo motor—all contained in
a sealed case that prevents contamination by outside air (see Figure 8.1).
The aluminum
platters
are
coated with a magnetic medium.
Two tiny read/write heads ser-
vice each platter, one to read the
top and the other to read the bot-
tom of the platter (see Figure 8.2).
The coating on the platters is
phenomenally smooth! It has to
be, as the read/write heads actu-
ally float on a cushion of air above
the platters, which spin at speeds between 3500 and 10,000
rpm. The distance (flying height) between the heads and the
disk surface is less than the thickness of a fingerprint. The
closer the read/write heads are to the platter, the more
densely the data packs onto the drive. These infinitesimal
tolerances demand that the platters never be exposed to out-
side air. Even a tiny dust particle on a platter would act like
a mountain in the way of the read/write heads and would
cause catastrophic damage to the drive. To keep the air clean
inside the drive, all hard drives use a tiny, heavily filtered
aperture to keep the air pressure equalized between the
interior and the exterior of the drive.
Data Encoding
Although the hard drive stores data in binary form, visual-
izing a magnetized spot representing a one and a non-mag-
netized spot representing a zero grossly oversimplifies
the process. Hard drives store data in tiny magnetic

Implementing Hard Drives
In the Essentials book you covered the process of implementing a
preinstalled drive. What are the two steps that must be performed on ev-
ery installed hard drive so that the operating system can use the drive?

fields—think of them as tiny magnets
that can be placed in either direction on
the platter, as shown in Figure 8.3. Each
tiny magnetic field, called a flux, can
switch back and forth through a process
called a flux reversal (see Figure 8.4).
Electronic equipment can read and
write flux reversals much faster and
easier than it can magnetize or not mag-
netize a spot to store a one or a zero.
In early hard drives, as the read/
write head moved over a spot, the direc-
tion of the flux reversal defined a one or
a zero. As the read/write head passed
from the left to the right, it recognized
fluxes in one direction as a zero and the
other direction as a one (Figure 8.5).
Hard drives read these flux reversals at
a very high speed when accessing or
writing data.
Today’s hard drives use a more
complex
and
efficient
method
to
interpret flux reversals using special
data
encoding
systems.
Instead
of
reading individual fluxes, a modern
hard drive reads groups of fluxes called
runs. Starting around 1991, hard drives
began using a data encoding system
known as run length limited (RLL). With
RLL, any combination of ones and
zeroes
can
be
stored
in
a
preset
combination of about 15 different runs.
The hard drive looks for these runs and
reads them as a group, resulting in
much faster and much more dense data.
Whenever you see RLL, you also see
two numbers: the minimum and the
maximum run length, such as RLL 1,7
or RLL 2,7. Figure 8.6 shows two
sequential RLL runs.
Current drives use an extremely advanced method of RLL called Par-
tial Response Maximum Likelihood (PRML) encoding. As hard drives pack
more and more fluxes on the drive, the individual fluxes start to interact
with each other, making it more and more difficult for the drive to verify
where one flux stops and another starts. PRML uses powerful, intelligent
circuitry to analyze each flux reversal and to make a “best guess” as to what
type of flux reversal it just read. As a result, the maximum run length for
PRML drives reaches up to around 16 to 20 fluxes, far more than the 7 or so
on RLL drives. Longer run lengths enable the hard drive to use more com-
plicated run combinations so that the hard drive can store a phenomenal

amount of data. For example, a run of only 12 fluxes on a hard drive might
equal a string of 30 or 40 ones and zeroes when handed to the system from
the hard drive.
The size required by each magnetic flux on a hard drive has reduced
considerably over the years, resulting in higher capacities. As fluxes become
smaller, they begin to interfere with each other in weird ways. I have to say
weird since to make sense of what’s going on at this subatomic level (I told
you these fluxes were small!) would require that you take a semester of
quantum mechanics! Let’s just say that laying fluxes flat against the platter
has reached its limit. To get around this problem, hard drive makers re-
cently began to make hard drives that store their flux reversals vertically (up
and down) rather than longitudinally (forward and backward), enabling
them to make hard drives in the 1 terabyte (1024 gigabyte) range. Manufac-
turers call this vertical storage method perpendicular recording (Figure 8.7).
For all this discussion and detail on data encoding, the day-to-day PC
technician never deals with encoding. Sometimes, however, knowing what
you don’t need to know helps as much as knowing what you do need to
know. Fortunately, data encoding is inherent to the hard drive and com-
pletely invisible to the system. You’re never going to have to deal with data
encoding, but you’ll sure sound smart when talking to other PC techs if you
know your RLL from your PRML!
Moving the Arms
The read/write heads move across the platter on the ends of actuator arms. In
the entire history of hard drives, manufacturers have used only two technol-
ogies to move the arms: stepper motor and voice coil . Hard drives first used
stepper motor technology, but today they’ve all moved to voice coil.
Stepper motor technology moved the arm in fixed increments or steps,
but the technology had several limitations that doomed it. Because the inter-
face between motor and actuator arm required minimal slippage to ensure
precise and reproducible movements, the positioning of the arms became
less precise over time. This physical deterioration caused data transfer er-
rors. Additionally, heat deformation wreaked havoc with stepper motor
drives. Just as valve clearances in automobile engines change with operat-
ing temperature, the positioning accuracy changed as the PC operated and
various hard drive components got warmer. Although very small, these
changes caused problems. Accessing the data written on a cold hard drive,
for example, became difficult after the disk warmed. In addition, the read/
write heads could damage the disk surface if not “parked” (set in a non-data
area) when not in use, requiring techs to use special parking programs
before transporting a step-
per motor drive.
All
hard
drives
made
today employ a linear motor
to move the actuator arms.
The
linear
motor,
more
popularly called a voice coil
motor,
uses
a
permanent
magnet surrounding a coil on
the actuator arm. When an

Floppy disk drives still use
stepper motors.

electrical current passes, the coil generates a magnetic field that moves the
actuator arm. The direction of the actuator arm’s movement depends on the
polarity of the electrical current through the coil. Because the voice coil and the
actuator arm never touch, no degradation in positional accuracy takes place
over time. Voice coil drives automatically park the heads when the drive loses
power, making the old stepper motor park programs obsolete.
Lacking the discrete “steps” of the stepper motor drive, a voice coil drive
cannot accurately predict the movement of the heads across the disk. To
make sure voice coil drives land exactly in the correct area, the drive re-
serves one side of one platter for navigational purposes. This area essen-
tially “maps” the exact location of the data on the drive. The voice coil
moves the read/write head to its best guess about the correct position on the
hard drive. The read/write head then uses this map to fine-tune its true po-
sition and make any necessary adjustments.
Now that you have a basic understanding of how a drive physically
stores data, let’s turn to how the hard drive organizes that data so we can
use that drive.
Geometry
Have you ever seen a cassette tape? If you look at the actual brown Mylar (a
type of plastic) tape, nothing will tell you whether sound is recorded on that
tape. Assuming the tape is not blank, however, you know something is on the
tape. Cassettes store music in distinct magnetized lines. You could say that
the physical placement of those lines of magnetism is the tape’s “geometry.”
Geometry also determines where a hard drive stores data. As with a cas-
sette tape, if you opened up a hard drive, you would not see the geometry.
But rest assured that the drive has geometry; in fact, every model of hard
drive uses a different geometry. We describe the geometry for a particular
hard drive with a set of numbers representing three values: heads, cylin-
ders, and sectors per track.
Heads
The number of heads for a specific hard drive describes, rather logically, the
number of read/write heads used by the drive to store data. Every platter
requires two heads. If a hard drive has four platters, for example, it would
need eight heads (see Figure 8.8).
Based on this description of heads, you would think that hard drives
would always have an even number of heads, right? Wrong! Most hard
drives reserve a head or two for their own use. Therefore, a hard drive can
have either an even or an odd number of heads.
Cylinders
To visualize cylinders, imagine taking a soup can and opening both ends of
the can. Wash off the label and clean out the inside. Now look at the shape of
the can; it is a geometric shape called a cylinder. Now imagine taking that
cylinder and sharpening one end so that it easily cuts through the hardest
metal. Visualize placing the ex-soup can over the hard drive and pushing it
down through the drive. The can cuts into one side and out the other of

Tech Tip
Fluid Bearings
Currently, almost all hard drives
use a motor located in the center
spindle supporting the drive plat-
ters. Traditionally, tiny ball bear-
ings support the spindle motor,
and as disk technology has ad-
vanced, these ball bearings have
become the limiting factor in the
three critical design criteria for
hard drives: rotational speed,
storage capacity, and noise levels.
The higher the rotational speed of
a drive, the more the metal-on-
metal contact creates heat and lu-
bricant problems that impact the
lifespan of the bearings. However
precisely machined, ball bearings
are not perfectly round. The mea-
surement of how much they wob-
ble (and thus how much the drive
platters wobble), called runout, is
now the limiting factor on how
densely you can pack information
together on a disk drive.
The technological fix for this
comes in the form of fluid bear-
ings. A fluid bearing is basically
a small amount of lubricant
trapped in a carefully machined
housing. The use of fluid in place
of metal balls means that no con-
tact occurs between metal sur-
faces to generate heat and wear.
The fluid also creates no mechani-
cal vibration, so fluid bearings
can support higher rotational
speeds. The runout of a fluid
bearing is about one-tenth that of

each platter. Each circle transcribed by the can is where you store data on the
drive, and is called a track (Figure 8.9).
Each side of each platter contains tens of thousands of tracks. Interest-
ingly enough, the individual tracks themselves are not directly part of the
drive geometry. Our interest lies only in the groups of tracks of the same di-
ameter, going all of the way through the drive. Each group of tracks of the
same diameter is called a cylinder (see Figure 8.10).
There’s more than one cylinder! Go get yourself about a thousand more
cans, each one a different diameter, and push them through the hard drive.
A typical hard drive contains thousands of cylinders.
Sectors per Track
Now imagine cutting the hard drive like a birthday cake, slicing all the
tracks into tens of thousands of small slivers. Each sliver is called a sector,
and each sector stores 512 bytes of data (see Figure 8.11). Note that sector

refers to the sliver when discussing geometry, but it refers to the
specific spot on a single track within that sliver when discussing
data capacity.
The sector is the universal “atom” of all hard drives. You
can’t divide data into anything smaller than a sector. Although
sectors are important, the number of sectors is not a geometry.
The geometry value is called sectors per track (sectors/track).
The sectors/track value describes the number of sectors in each
track (see Figure 8.12).
The Big Three
Cylinders, heads, and sectors/track combine to define the hard
drive’s geometry. In most cases, these three critical values are
referred to as CHS. The importance of these three values lies in
the fact that the PC’s BIOS needs to know the drive’s geometry
to know how to talk to the drive. Back in the old days, a techni-
cian needed to enter these values into the CMOS setup program
manually. Today, every hard drive stores the CHS information
in the drive itself, in an electronic format that enables the BIOS
to query the drive automatically to determine these values.
You’ll see more on this later in the chapter in the section called
“Autodetection.”
Two other values—write precompensation cylinder and
landing zone—no longer have relevance in today’s PCs; how-
ever, these terms still are tossed around and a few CMOS setup
utilities still support them—another classic example of a technology appen-
dix! Let’s look at these two holdouts from another era so when you access
CMOS, you won’t say, “What the heck are these?”
Write Precompensation Cylinder
Older hard drives had a real problem with the fact that sectors toward the
inside of the drives were much smaller than sectors toward the outside. To
handle this, an older drive would spread data a little farther apart once it got
to a particular cylinder. This cylinder was called the write precompensation
Chapter 8: Hard Drive Technologies
107
• Figure 8.10
Cylinder
• Figure 8.11
Sectors

(write precomp) cylinder, and the PC had to know
which cylinder began this wider data spacing. Hard
drives no longer have this problem, making the write
precomp setting obsolete.
Landing Zone
On older hard drives with stepper motors, the landing
zone value designated an unused cylinder as a “parking
place” for the read/write heads. As mentioned earlier,
old stepper motor hard drives needed to have their
read/write heads parked before being moved in order to
avoid accidental damage. Today’s voice coil drives park
themselves whenever they’re not accessing data, automatically placing the
read/write heads on the landing zone. As a result, the BIOS no longer needs
the landing zone geometry.

■ATA—The King
Over the years, many interfaces existed for hard drives, with such names as
ST-506 and ESDI. Don’t worry about what these abbreviations stood for;
neither the CompTIA A+ certification exams nor the computer world at
large has an interest in these prehistoric interfaces. Starting around 1990, an
interface called ATA appeared that now virtually monopolizes the hard
drive market. ATA hard drives are often referred to as integrated drive elec-
tronics (IDE) drives. Only one other type of interface, the moderately popu-
lar small computer system interface (SCSI), has any relevance for hard
drives. ATA drives come in two basic flavors. The older
parallel ATA
(PATA) drives send data in parallel, on a 40- or 80-wire data cable. PATA
drives dominated the industry for more than a decade but are being re-
placed by serial ATA (SATA) drives that send data in serial, using only one
wire for data transfers. The leap from PATA to SATA is only one of a large
number of changes that have taken place over the years with ATA. To appre-
ciate these changes, we’ll run through the many ATA standards forwarded
over the years.
ATA-1
When IBM unveiled the 80286-powered IBM PC AT in the early 1980s, it in-
troduced the first PC to include BIOS support for hard drives. This BIOS
supported up to two physical drives, and each drive could be up to 504 MB—
far larger than the 5-MB and 10-MB drives of the time. Although having
built-in support for hard drives certainly improved the power of the PC, at
that time, installing, configuring, and troubleshooting hard drives could at
best be called difficult.
To address these problems, Western Digital and Compaq developed a
new hard drive interface and placed this specification before the American

Tech Tip
IDE
The term IDE (integrated drive
electronics) refers to any hard
drive with a built-in controller.
All hard drives are technically
IDE drives, although we only use
the term IDE when discussing
ATA drives.
Tech Tip
External Hard Drives
A quick trip to any major com-
puter store will reveal a thriving
trade in external hard drives. You
used to be able to find external
drives that connected to the slow
parallel port, but external drives
today connect to a FireWire,
Hi-Speed USB 2.0, or eSATA
port. All three interfaces offer
high data transfer rates and
hot-swap capability, making them
ideal for transporting huge files
such as digital video clips. Re-
gardless of the external interface,
however, inside the casing you’ll
find an ordinary PATA or SATA
drive, just like those described in
this chapter.

National Standards Institute (ANSI) committees, which in turn put out the AT
Attachment (ATA) interface in March of 1989. The ATA interface specified a
cable and a built-in controller on the drive itself. Most importantly, the ATA
standard used the existing AT BIOS on a PC, which meant that you didn’t
have to replace the old system BIOS to make the drive work—a very impor-
tant consideration for compatibility but one that would later haunt ATA
drives. The official name for the standard, ATA, never made it into the com-
mon vernacular until recently, and then only as PATA to distinguish it from
SATA drives.
Early ATA Physical Connections
The first ATA drives connected to the computer with a 40-pin ribbon cable
that plugged into the drive and to a hard drive controller. The cable has a
colored stripe down one side that denotes pin 1 and should connect to the
drive’s pin 1 and to the controller’s pin 1. Figure 8.13 shows the “business
end” of an early ATA drive, with the connectors for the ribbon cable and the
power cable.
The controller is the support circuitry that acts as the intermediary be-
tween the hard drive and the external data bus. Electronically, the setup
looks like Figure 8.14.
Wait a minute! If ATA drives
are IDE (see the Tech Tip), they al-
ready have a built-in controller.
Why do they then have to plug into
a controller on the motherboard?
Well, this is a great example of a
term that’s not used properly, but
everyone (including the mother-
board and hard drive makers) uses
it this way. What we call the ATA
controller is really no more than an
interface providing a connection to
the rest of the PC system. When
your BIOS talks to the hard drive, it
actually talks to the onboard cir-
cuitry on the drive, not the connec-
tion on the motherboard. But, even
though the real controller resides on the hard drive, the
40-pin connection on the motherboard is called the con-
troller. We have a lot of misnomers to live with in the
ATA world!
The ATA-1 standard defined that no more than two
drives attach to a single IDE connector on a single ribbon
cable. Because up to two drives can attach to one connec-
tor via a single cable, you need to be able to identify each
drive on the cable. The ATA standard identifies the two
different drives as “master” and “slave.” You set one
drive as master and one as slave using tiny jumpers on
the drives (Figure 8.15).
Chapter 8: Hard Drive Technologies
109
The ANSI subcommittee di-
rectly responsible for the ATA
standard is called Technical
Committee T13. If you want to
know what’s happening with
ATA, check out the T13 Web site:

The controllers are on the motherboard and manifest themselves as two
40-pin male ports, as shown in Figure 8.16.
PIO and DMA Modes
If you’re making a hard drive standard, you must define both the method
and the speed at which the data’s going to move. ATA-1 defined two differ-
ent methods, the first using programmed I/O (PIO) addressing and the sec-
ond using direct memory access (DMA) mode.

PIO is nothing more than the traditional I/O addressing scheme, where
the CPU talks directly to the hard drive via the BIOS to send and receive
data. Three different PIO speeds called PIO modes were initially adopted:
■
PIO mode 0: 3.3 MBps (megabytes per second)
■
PIO mode 1: 5.2 MBps
■
PIO mode 2: 8.3 MBps
DMA modes defined a method to enable the hard drives to talk to RAM
directly using old-style DMA commands. (The ATA folks called this single
word DMA.) This old-style DMA was slow, and the resulting three ATA sin-
gle word DMA modes were also slow:
■
Single word DMA mode 0: 2.1 MBps
■
Single word DMA mode 1: 4.2 MBps
■
Single word DMA mode 2: 8.3 MBps
When a computer booted up, the BIOS queried the hard drive to see
what modes it could use and would then automatically adjust to the fastest
mode.
ATA-2
In 1990, the industry adopted a series of improvements to the ATA standard
called ATA-2. Many people called these new features Enhanced IDE (EIDE) .
EIDE was really no more than a marketing term invented by Western Digi-
tal, but it caught on in common vernacular and is still used today, although
its use is fading. Regular IDE drives quickly disappeared, and by 1995, EIDE
drives dominated the PC world. Figure 8.17 shows a typical EIDE drive.
Chapter 8: Hard Drive Technologies
111
The terms ATA, IDE, and EIDE
are used interchangeably.
• Figure 8.17
EIDE drive

ATA-2 was the most important ATA standard, as it included powerful
new features such as higher capacities; support for non–hard drive storage
devices; support for two more ATA devices, for a maximum of four; and
substantially improved throughput.
Higher Capacity with LBA
IBM created the AT BIOS to support hard drives many years before IDE
drives were invented, and every system had that BIOS. The developers of
IDE made certain that the new drives would run from the same AT BIOS
command set. With this capability, you could use the same CMOS and BIOS
routines to talk to a much more advanced drive. Your motherboard or hard
drive controller wouldn’t become instantly obsolete when you installed a
new hard drive.
Unfortunately, the BIOS routines for the original AT command set allowed
a hard drive size of only up to 528 million bytes (or 504 MB—remember that a
mega = 1,048,576, not 1,000,000). A drive could have no more than 1024 cyl-
inders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors/track:
1024 cylinders × 16 heads × 63 sectors/track × 512 bytes/sector = 504 MB
For years, this was not a problem. But when hard drives began to ap-
proach the 504 MB barrier, it became clear that there needed to be a way of
getting past 504 MB. The ATA-2 standard defined a way to get past this limit
with logical block addressing (LBA) . With LBA, the hard drive lies to the
computer about its geometry through an advanced type of sector transla-
tion. Let’s take a moment to understand sector transla-
tion, and then come back to LBA.
Sector Translation
Long before hard drives approached
the 504 MB limit, the limits of 1024 cylinders, 16 heads,
and 63 sectors/track gave hard drive makers fits. The
big problem was the heads. Remember that every two
heads means another platter, another physical disk that
you have to squeeze into a hard drive. If you wanted a
hard drive with the maximum number of 16 heads, you
would need a hard drive with eight physical platters
inside the drive! Nobody wanted that many platters: it
made the drives too tall, it took more power to spin up
the drive, and that many parts cost too much money (see
Figure 8.18).
Manufacturers could readily produce a hard drive
that had fewer heads and more cylinders, but the stupid
1024/16/63 limit got in the way. Plus, the traditional
sector arrangement wasted a lot of useful space. Sectors
toward the inside of the drive, for example, are much
shorter than the sectors on the outside. The sectors on the
outside don’t need to be that long, but with the tradi-
tional geometry setup, hard drive makers had no choice.
They could make a hard drive store a lot more informa-
tion, however, if hard drives could be made with more
sectors/track on the outside tracks (see Figure 8.19).

Hard drive makers talk about
hard drive capacities in millions
and billions of bytes, not mega-
bytes and gigabytes!

Multiple sectors/track

The ATA specification was designed to have two geometries. The physi-
cal geometry defined the real layout of the CHS inside the drive. The logical
geometry described what the drive told the CMOS. In other words, the IDE
drive “lied” to the CMOS, thus side-stepping the artificial limits of the BIOS.
When data was being transferred to and from the drive, the onboard cir-
cuitry of the drive translated the logical geometry into the physical geome-
try. This function was, and still is, called sector translation .
Let’s look at a couple of hypothetical examples in action. First, pretend
that Seagate came out with a new,
cheap, fast hard drive called the
ST108. To get the ST108 drive fast
and cheap, however, Seagate had
to use a rather strange geometry,
shown in Table 8.1.
Notice that the cylinder num-
ber is greater than 1024. To over-
come this problem, the IDE drive
performs a sector translation that
reports a geometry to the BIOS that
is totally different from the true ge-
ometry of the drive. Table 8.2
shows the actual geometry and the
“logical” geometry of our mythical
ST108 drive. Notice that the logical
geometry is now within the accept-
able parameters of the BIOS limita-
tions.
Sector
translation
never
changes the capacity of the drive; it
changes only the geometry to stay
within the BIOS limits.
Back to LBA
Now let’s watch how the advanced sector translation of LBA
provides support for hard drives greater than 504 MB. Let’s use an old drive,
the Western Digital WD2160, a 2.1-GB hard drive, as an example. This drive is
no longer in production but its smaller CHS values make understanding LBA
easier. Table 8.3 lists its physical and logical geometries.
Note that, even with sector translation, the number of heads is greater than
the allowed 16! So here’s where the magic of LBA comes in. The WD2160 is ca-
pable of LBA. Now assuming that the BIOS is also capable of LBA, here’s
what happens. When the com-
puter boots up, the BIOS asks the
drives if they can perform LBA. If
they say yes, the BIOS and the
drive work together to change the
way they talk to each other. They
can do this without conflicting
with the original AT BIOS com-
mands by taking advantage of un-
used commands to use up to 256
heads. LBA enables support for a

GB was hundreds of time larger than the drives used at the time. Don’t worry,
later ATA standards will get the BIOS up to today’s huge drives!
Not Just Hard Drives Anymore: ATAPI
ATA-2 added an extension to the ATA specification, called Advanced Tech-
nology Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI) , that enabled non–hard drive
devices such as CD-ROM drives and tape backups to connect to the PC via
the ATA controllers. ATAPI drives have the same 40-pin interface and mas-
ter/slave jumpers as ATA hard drives. Figure 8.20 shows an ATAPI
CD-RW drive attached to a motherboard. The key
difference between hard drives and every other
type of drive that attaches to the ATA controller is
in how the drives get BIOS support. Hard drives
get it through the system BIOS, whereas non–hard
drives require the operating system to load a
software driver.
More Drives with ATA-2
ATA-2 added support for a second controller,
raising the total number of supported drives from
two to four. Each of the two controllers is equal in
power and capability. Figure 8.21 is a close-up of
a typical motherboard, showing the primary con-
troller marked as IDE1 and the secondary marked
as IDE2.
Increased Speed
ATA-2 defined two new PIO modes and a new
type of DMA called multi-word DMA that was a
substantial improvement over the old DMA.

With the introduction of
ATAPI, the ATA standards are
often referred to as ATA/ATAPI
instead of just ATA.

Technically, multi-word DMA was still the old-style DMA, but it worked in
a much more efficient manner so it was much faster.

Multi-word DMA mode 1: 13.3 MBps

ATA-3
ATA-3 came on quickly after ATA-2 and added
one new feature called Self-Monitoring, Analy-
sis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T. , one
of the few PC acronyms that requires the use of
periods after each letter). S.M.A.R.T. helps pre-
dict when a hard drive is going to fail by moni-
toring the hard drive’s mechanical components.
S.M.A.R.T. is a great idea and is popular in
specialized server systems, but it’s complex, im-
perfect, and hard to understand. As a result, only
a few utilities can read the S.M.A.R.T. data on
your hard drive. Your best sources are the hard
drive manufacturers. Every hard drive maker
has a free diagnostic tool (that usually works
only for their drives) that will do a S.M.A.R.T.
check along with other tests. Figure 8.22 shows
Western Digital’s Data Lifeguard Tool in action.
Note that it says only whether the drive has
passed or not. Figure 8.23 shows some S.M.A.R.T.
information.

ATA-4
Anyone who has opened a big database file on a hard drive appreciates that
a faster hard drive is better. ATA-4 introduced a new DMA mode called
Ultra DMA that is now the primary way a hard drive communicates with a
PC. Ultra DMA uses DMA bus mastering to achieve far faster speeds than
was possible with PIO or old-style DMA. ATA-4 defined three Ultra DMA
modes:
■
Ultra DMA mode 0: 16.7 MBps
■
Ultra DMA mode 1: 25.0 MBps
■
Ultra DMA mode 2: 33.3 MBps
INT13 Extensions
Here’s an interesting factoid for you: The original ATA-1 standard allowed
for hard drives up to 137 GB! It wasn’t the ATA standard that caused the
504-MB size limit, it was the fact that the standard used the old AT BIOS and
the BIOS, not the ATA standard, could support only 504 MB. LBA was a
work-around that told the hard drive to lie to the BIOS to get it up to 8.4 GB.
But eventually hard drives started edging close to the LBA limit and some-
thing had to be done. The T13 folks said, “This isn’t our problem! It’s the an-
cient BIOS problem. You BIOS makers need to fix the BIOS!” And they did.
In 1994, Phoenix Technologies (the BIOS manufacturer) came up with a
new set of BIOS commands called Interrupt 13 (INT13) extensions . INT13
extensions broke the 8.4-GB barrier by completely ignoring the CHS values
and instead feeding the LBA a stream of addressable sectors. A system with
INT13 extensions can handle drives up to 137 GB. The entire PC industry
quickly adopted INT13 extensions and every system made since 2000–2001
supports INT13 extensions.
ATA-5
Ultra DMA was such a huge hit that the ATA folks adopted two faster Ultra
DMA modes with ATA-5:
■
Ultra DMA mode 3: 44.4 MBps
■
Ultra DMA mode 4: 66.6 MBps
Ultra DMA modes 4 and 5 ran so quickly that the ATA-5 standard de-
fined a new type of ribbon cable of handling the higher speeds. This 80-wire
cable still has 40 pins on the connectors, but it includes another 40 wires
in the cable that act as grounds to improve the cable’s ability to handle
high-speed signals. The 80-wire cable, just like the 40-pin ribbon cable, has a
colored stripe down one side give you proper orientation for pin 1 on the

modes, is also called ATA/33.

modes, is also called ATA/66.

controller and the hard drive. Previous ver-
sions of ATA didn’t define where the differ-
ent drives were plugged into the ribbon
cable, but ATA-5 defined exactly where the
controller, master, and slave drives con-
nected, even defining colors to identify
them. Take a look at the ATA/66 cable in
Figure 8.24. The connector on the left is col-
ored blue (which you could see if the photo
was in color!)—that connector must be the
one used to plug into the controller. The
connector in the middle is grey—that’s for
the slave drive. The connector on the right is
black—that’s for the master drive. Any
ATA/66 controller connections are colored
blue to let you know it is an ATA/66
controller.
ATA/66 is backward compatible, so you may safely plug an earlier
drive into an ATA/66 cable and controller. If you plug an ATA/66 drive
into an older controller it will work⎯just not in ATA/66 mode. The only
risky action is to use an ATA/66 controller and hard drive with a non-ATA/
66 cable. Doing so will almost certainly cause nasty data losses!
ATA-6
Hard drive size exploded in the early 21st century and the seemingly
impossible-to-fill 137-GB limit created by INT13 extensions became a bar-
rier to fine computing more quickly than most people had anticipated.
When drives started hitting the 120-GB mark, the T13 committee adopted an
industry proposal pushed by Maxtor (a major hard drive maker) called Big
Drive that increased the limit to more than 144 petabytes (approximately
144,000,000 GB). T13 also thankfully gave the new standard a less-silly
name, calling it ATA/ATAPI-6 or simply ATA-6 . Big Drive was basically just
a 48-bit LBA, supplanting the older 24-bit addressing of LBA and INT13 ex-
tensions. Plus, the standard defined an enhanced block mode, enabling
drives to transfer up to 65,536 sectors in one chunk, up from the measly 256
sectors of lesser drive technologies.
ATA-6 also introduced Ultra DMA mode 5, kicking the data transfer rate
up to 100 MBps. Ultra DMA mode 5 is more commonly referred to as ATA/
100, which requires the same 80-wire connectors as ATA/66.
ATA-7
ATA-7 brought two new innovations to the ATA world⎯one evolutionary
and the other revolutionary. The evolutionary innovation came with the last
of the parallel ATA Ultra DMA modes; the revolutionary was a new form of
ATA called serial ATA (SATA).
Chapter 8: Hard Drive Technologies
117
• Figure 8.24
ATA/66 cable

ATA/133
ATA-7 introduced the fastest and probably least adopted of all the ATA
speeds, Ultra DMA mode 6 ( ATA/133 ). Even though it runs at a speed of
133 MBps, the fact that it came out with SATA kept many hard drive manu-
facturers away. ATA/133 uses the same cables as Ultra DMA 66 and 100.
While you won’t find many ATA/133 hard drives, you will find plenty
of ATA/133 controllers. There’s a trend in the industry to color the control-
ler connections on the hard drive red, although this is not part of the ATA-7
standard.
Serial ATA
The real story of ATA-7 is SATA. For all its longevity as the mass storage in-
terface of choice for the PC, parallel ATA has problems. First, the flat ribbon
cables impede airflow and can be a pain to insert properly. Second, the ca-
bles have a limited length, only 18 inches. Third, you can’t hot-swap PATA
drives. You have to shut down completely before installing or replacing a
drive. Finally, the technology has simply reached the limits of what it can do
in terms of throughput.
Serial ATA addresses these issues. SATA creates a point-to-point connec-
tion between the SATA device—hard disk, CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD-ROM,
DVD-RW, and so on—and the SATA controller. At a glance, SATA devices
look identical to standard PATA devices. Take a closer look at the cable and
power connectors, however, and you’ll see significant differences (Figure 8.25).
Because SATA devices send data serially instead of in parallel, the
SATA interface needs far fewer physical wires—seven instead of the eighty
wires that is typical of PATA—resulting in much thinner cabling. This
might not seem significant, but the benefit is that thinner cabling means
better cable control and better airflow through the PC case, resulting in
better cooling.

Further, the maximum SATA device cable length is more than twice that
of an IDE cable—about 40 inches (1 meter) instead of 18 inches. Again, this
might not seem like a big deal, unless you’ve struggled to connect a PATA
hard disk installed into the top bay of a full-tower case to an IDE connector
located all the way at the bottom of the motherboard!
SATA does away with the entire master/slave concept. Each drive con-
nects to one port, so no more daisy-chaining drives. Further, there’s no maxi-
mum number of drives⎯many motherboards are now available that support
up to eight SATA drives. Want more? Snap in a SATA host card and load
’em up!
The big news, however, is in data throughput. As the name implies,
SATA devices transfer data in serial bursts instead of parallel, as PATA de-
vices do. Typically, you might not think of serial devices as being faster than
parallel, but in this case, that’s exactly the case. A SATA device’s single
stream of data moves much faster than the multiple streams of data coming
from a parallel IDE device—theoretically up to 30 times faster! SATA drives
come in two common varieties, the 1.5Gb and the 3Gb, that have a maxi-
mum throughput of 150 MBps and 300 MBps, respectively.
SATA is backward compatible with current PATA standards and en-
ables you to install a parallel ATA device, including a hard drive, optical
drive, and other devices, to a serial ATA controller by using a SATA bridge .
A SATA bridge manifests as a tiny card that you plug directly into the
40-pin connector on a PATA drive. As you can see in Figure 8.26, the con-
troller chip on the bridge requires separate power; you plug a Molex con-
nector into the PATA drive as normal. When you boot the system, the PATA
drive shows up to the system as a SATA drive.
SATA’s ease of use has made it the choice for desktop system storage,
and its success is already showing in the fact that more than 90 percent of all
hard drives sold today are SATA drives.

Tech Tip
SATA Names
Number-savvy readers might
have noticed a discrepancy be-
tween the names and throughput
of the two SATA drives. After all,
1.5 Gb per second throughput
translates to 192 MB per second,
a lot higher than the advertised
speed of a “mere” 150 MBps. The
same is true of the 3Gb/300 MBps
drives. The encoding scheme used
on SATA drives takes about
20 percent of the overhead for the
drive, leaving 80 percent for pure
bandwidth. The 3Gb drive created
all kinds of problems, because the
name of the committee working
on the specifications was called
the SATA II committee, and mar-
keters picked up on the SATA II
name. As a result, you’ll find
many brands called SATA II
rather than 3Gb. The SATA com-
mittee now goes by the name
SATA-IO.

eSATA
External SATA (eSATA)
extends
the SATA bus to external devices,
as the name would imply. The
eSATA drives use similar connec-
tors to internal SATA, but they’re
keyed differently so you can’t mis-
take one for the other. Figure 8.27
shows eSATA connectors on the
back of a motherboard. eSATA uses
shielded cable lengths up to 2 me-
ters outside the PC and is hot
pluggable. The beauty of eSATA is
that it extends the SATA bus at full
speed, so you’re not limited to the
meager 50 or 60 MBps of FireWire
or USB.
■SCSI: Still Around
Many specialized server machines and enthusiasts’ systems use the small
computer system interface (SCSI) technologies for various pieces of core
hardware and peripherals, from hard drives to printers to high-end tape
backup machines. SCSI is different from ATA in that SCSI devices connect
together in a string of devices called a chain. Each device in the chain gets a
SCSI ID to distinguish it from other devices on the chain. Last, the ends of a
SCSI chain must be terminated. Let’s dive into SCSI now, and see how SCSI
chains, SCSI IDs, and termination all work.
SCSI is an old technology dating from the late 1970s, but it has been con-
tinually updated. SCSI is faster than ATA
(though the gap is closing fast), and until
SATA arrived SCSI was the only good
choice for anyone using RAID (see the
“RAID” section a little later). SCSI is ar-
guably fading away, but it still deserves
some mention.
SCSI Chains
SCSI manifests itself through a
SCSI
chain , a series of SCSI devices working
together through a host adapter. The host
adapter provides the interface between
the SCSI chain and the PC. Figure 8.28
shows a typical PCI host adapter. Many
techs refer to the host adapter as the SCSI
controller, so you should be comfortable
with both terms.

exam tests you on SCSI and
RAID, topics essential to server
environments.
• Figure 8.28
SCSI host adapter

All SCSI devices can be divided
into two groups: internal and external.
Internal SCSI devices are attached in-
side the PC and connect to the host
adapter through the latter’s internal
connector. Figure 8.29 shows an inter-
nal SCSI device, in this case a CD-ROM
drive. External devices hook to the ex-
ternal connector of the host adapter.
Figure 8.30 is an example of an external
SCSI device.
Internal SCSI devices connect to
the host adapter with a 68-pin ribbon
cable (Figure 8.31). This flat, flexible ca-
ble functions precisely like a PATA
cable. Many external devices connect to
the host adapter with a 50-pin high
density (HD) connector. Figure 8.32
shows a host adapter external port.
Higher end SCSI devices use a 68-pin
high density (HD) connector.
Multiple internal devices can be
connected together simply by using a
cable with enough connectors. Figure 8.33, for example, shows a cable that
can take up to four SCSI devices, including the host adapter.
Assuming the SCSI host adapter has a standard external port (some con-
trollers don’t have external connections at all), plugging in an external SCSI
device is as simple as running a cable from device to controller. The external
SCSI connectors are D-shaped, so you can’t plug them in backward. As an
added bonus, some external SCSI devices have two ports, one to connect to
the host adapter and a second to connect to another SCSI device. The process
of connecting a device directly to another device is called daisy-chaining.

121
• Figure 8.29
Internal SCSI CD-ROM
• Figure 8.30
Back of external SCSI device
• Figure 8.31
Typical 68-pin ribbon cable

You can daisy-chain up to 15 devices to one host adapter. SCSI
chains can be internal, external, or both (see Figure 8.34).
SCSI IDs
If you’re going to connect a number of devices on the same
SCSI chain, you must provide some way for the host adapter to
tell one device from another. To differentiate devices, SCSI
uses a unique identifier called the SCSI ID . The SCSI ID num-
ber can range from 0 to 15. SCSI IDs are similar to many other
PC hardware settings in that a SCSI device can theoretically
have any SCSI ID, as long as that ID is not already taken by an-
other device connected to the same host adapter.
Some conventions should be followed when setting SCSI IDs. Typically,
most people set the host adapter to 7 or 15, but you can change this setting.
Note that there is no order for the use of SCSI IDs. It does not matter which
device gets which number, and you
can skip numbers. Restrictions on
IDs apply only within a single chain.
Two devices can have the same ID, in
other words, as long as they are on
different chains (Figure 8.35).
Every SCSI device has some
method of setting its SCSI ID. The
trick is to figure out how as you’re
holding the device in your hand. A
SCSI device may use jumpers, dip
switches, or even tiny dials; every
new SCSI device is a new adventure
as you try to determine how to set its
SCSI ID.

Old SCSI equipment allowed
SCSI IDs from 0 to 7 only.

Termination
Whenever you send a signal down a wire, some of
that signal reflects back up the wire, creating an
echo and causing electronic chaos. SCSI chains use
termination to prevent this problem. Termination
simply means putting something on the ends of the
wire to prevent this echo. Terminators are usually
pull-down resistors and can manifest themselves in
many different ways. Most of the devices within a
PC have the appropriate termination built in. On
other devices, including SCSI chains and some net-
work cables, you have to set termination during
installation.
The rule with SCSI is that you must terminate
only the ends of the SCSI chain. You have to termi-
nate the ends of the cable, which usually means that
you need to terminate the two devices at the ends of the cable. Do not termi-
nate devices that are not on the ends of the cable. Figure 8.36 shows some ex-
amples of where to terminate SCSI devices.
Because any SCSI device might be on the end of a chain, most manufac-
turers build SCSI devices that can self-terminate. Some devices will detect
that they are on the end of the SCSI chain and will automatically terminate
themselves. Most devices, however, require that you set a jumper or switch to
enable termination (Figure 8.37).

■Protecting Data with RAID
Ask experienced techs, “What is the most expensive part of a PC?” and
they’ll all answer in the same way: “It’s the data.” You can replace any sin-
gle part of your PC for a few hundred dollars at most, but if you lose critical
data—well, let’s just say I know of two small companies that went out of
business just because they lost a hard drive full of data.
Data is king; data is your PC’s raison d’être. Losing data is a bad thing, so
you need some method to prevent data loss. Now, of course, you can do
backups, but if a hard drive dies, you have to shut down the computer, rein-
stall a new hard drive, reinstall the operating system, and then restore the
backup. There’s nothing wrong with this as long as you can afford the time
and cost of shutting down the system.
A better solution, though, would save your data if a hard drive died and
enable you to continue working throughout the process. This is possible if
you stop relying on a single hard drive and instead use two or more drives
to store your data. Sounds good, but how do you do this? Well, first of all,
you could install some fancy hard drive controller that reads and writes
data to two hard drives simultaneously (Figure 8.38). The data on each drive
would always be identical. One drive would be the primary drive and the
other drive, called the mirror drive, would not be used unless the primary
drive failed. This process of reading and writing data at the same time to
two drives is called disk mirroring .
If you really want to make data safe, you can use two separate control-
lers for each drive. With two drives, each on a separate controller, the sys-
tem will continue to operate, even if
the primary drive’s controller stops
working. This super-drive mirror-
ing technique is called
disk du-
plexing
(Figure
8.39).
Disk
duplexing is also much faster than
disk mirroring because one control-
ler does not write each piece of data
twice.
Even though duplexing is faster
than
mirroring,
they
both
are
slower than the classic one drive,
one controller setup. You can use
multiple drives to increase your
hard drive access speed. Disk strip-
ing (without parity) means spread-
ing the data among multiple (at
least two) drives. Disk striping by
itself provides no redundancy. If
you save a small Microsoft Word
file, for example, the file is split into
multiple pieces; half of the pieces go
on one drive and half on the other
(Figure 8.40).

Disk striping

The one and only advantage of disk striping is speed—it is a fast way to
read and write to hard drives. But if either drive fails, all data is lost. Disk
striping is not something you should do—unless you’re willing to increase
the risk of losing data to increase the speed at which your hard drives save
and restore data.
Disk striping with parity , in contrast, protects data by adding extra infor-
mation, called parity data, that can be used to rebuild data should one of the
drives fail. Disk striping with parity requires at least three drives, but it is
common to use more than three. Disk striping with parity combines the best
of disk mirroring and plain disk striping. It protects data and is quite fast.
The majority of network servers use a type of disk striping with parity.
RAID
A couple of sharp guys in Berkeley back in the 1980s organized the many
techniques for using multiple drives for data protection and increasing
speeds as the redundant array of independent (or inexpensive) disks (RAID) .
They outlined seven levels of RAID, numbered 0 through 6.
■
RAID 0—Disk Striping
Disk striping requires at least two drives.
It does not provide redundancy to data. If any one drive fails, all
data is lost.
■
RAID 1—Disk Mirroring/Duplexing
RAID 1 arrays require at
least two hard drives, although they also work with any even
number of drives. RAID 1 is the ultimate in safety, but you lose
storage space since the data is duplicated—you need two 100-GB
drives to store 100 GB of data.
■
RAID 2—Disk Striping with Multiple Parity Drives
RAID 2 was
a weird RAID idea that never saw practical use. Unused, ignore it.
■
RAID 3 and 4—Disk Striping with Dedicated Parity
RAID 3 and
4 combined dedicated data drives with dedicated parity drives. The
differences between the two are trivial. Unlike RAID 2, these
versions did see some use in the real world but were quickly
replaced by RAID 5.
■
RAID 5—Disk Striping with Distributed Parity
Instead of
dedicated data and parity drives, RAID 5 distributes data and parity
information evenly across all drives. This is the fastest way to
provide data redundancy. RAID 5 is by far the most common RAID
implementation and requires at least three drives. RAID 5 arrays
effectively use one drive’s worth of space for parity. If, for example,
you have three 200-GB drives, your total storage capacity is 400 GB.
If you have four 200-GB drives, your total capacity is 600 GB.
■
RAID 6—Disk Striping with Extra Parity
If you lose a hard drive
in a RAID 5 array, your data is at great risk until you replace the bad
hard drive and rebuild the array. RAID 6 is RAID 5 with extra parity
information. RAID 6 needs at least five drives, but in exchange you
can lose up to two drives at the same time. RAID 6 is gaining in
popularity for those willing to use larger arrays.
126
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
An array in the context of
RAID refers to a collection of two
or more hard drives.
Tech Tip
RAID Lingo
No tech worth her salt says
things like, “We’re implementing
disk striping with parity.” Use
the RAID level. Say, “We’re im-
plementing RAID 5.” It’s more
accurate and very impressive to
the folks in the accounting
department!

After these first RAID levels were defined, some manufacturers came up
with ways to combine different RAIDs. For example, what if you took two
pairs of striped drives and mirrored the pairs? You would get what is called
RAID 0+1. Or what (read this carefully now) if you took two pairs of mir-
rored drives and striped the pairs? You then get what we call RAID 1+0 or
what is often called RAID 10. Combinations of different types of single
RAID are called multiple RAID solutions. Multiple RAID solutions, while
enjoying some support in the real world, are quite rare when compared to
single RAID solutions RAID 0, 1, and 5.
Implementing RAID
RAID levels describe different methods of providing data redundancy or
enhancing the speed of data throughput to and from groups of hard drives.
They do not say how to implement these methods. Literally thousands of dif-
ferent methods can be used to set up RAID. The method used depends
largely on the desired level of RAID, the operating system used, and the
thickness of your wallet.
The obvious starting place for RAID is to connect at least two hard
drives in some fashion to create a RAID array. For many years, if you
wanted to do RAID beyond RAID 0 and RAID 1, the only technology you
could use was good-old SCSI. SCSI’s chaining of multiple devices to a single
controller made it a natural for RAID. SCSI drives make superb RAID ar-
rays, but the high cost of SCSI drives and RAID-capable host adapters kept
RAID away from all but the most critical systems—usually big file servers.
In the last few years, substantial leaps in ATA technology have made
ATA a viable alternative to SCSI drive technology for RAID arrays. Special-
ized ATA RAID controller cards support ATA RAID arrays of up to 15
drives—plenty to support even the most complex RAID needs. In addition,
the inherent hot-swap capabilities of serial ATA have virtually guaranteed
that serial ATA will quickly take over the lower end of the RAID business.
Chapter 8: Hard Drive Technologies

You'll hear the term nested
RAID used for multiple RAID
solutions. The terms are
synonymous.
Try This!
Managing Heat with Multiple Drives
Adding three or more fast hard drives into a cramped PC case can be a
recipe for disaster to the unwary tech. All those disks spinning con-
stantly create a phenomenal amount of heat. Heat kills PCs! You’ve got
to manage the heat inside a RAID-enabled system or risk losing your
data, drives, and basic system stability. The easiest way to do this is to
add fans, so Try This!
Open up your PC case and look for built-in places to mount fans.
How many case fans do you have installed now? What size are they?
What sizes can you use? (Most cases use 80 mm fans, but 60 and 120 mm
fans are common as well.) Jot down the particulars of your system and
take a trip to the local PC store to check out the fans.
Before you get all fan-happy and grab the biggest and baddest fans
to throw in your case, don’t forget to think about the added noise level.
Try to get a compromise between keeping your case cool enough and
not causing early deafness!
There is actually a term for a
storage system composed of
multiple independent disks,
rather than disks organized us-
ing RAID: JBOD, which stands
for Just a Bunch of Disks (or
Drives).

Personally, I think the price and performance of serial ATA mean SCSI’s
days are numbered.
Once you have a number of hard drives, the next question is whether to
use hardware or software to control the array. Let’s look at both options.
Hardware versus Software
All RAID implementations break down into either hardware or software meth-
ods. Software is often used when price takes priority over performance. Hard-
ware is used when you need speed along with data redundancy. Software
RAID does not require special controllers—you can use the regular ATA con-
trollers or SCSI host adapters to make a software RAID array. But you do need
“smart” software. The most common software implementation of RAID is the
built-in RAID software that comes with Windows 2000 Server and Windows
Server 2003. The Disk Management program in these Windows Server ver-
sions can configure drives for RAID 0, 1, or 5, and it works with ATA or SCSI
(Figure 8.41). Disk Management in Windows 2000 Professional and Windows
XP Professional, in contrast, can only do RAID 0.
Windows Disk Management is not the only software RAID game in
town. A number of third-party software programs can be used with Win-
dows or other operating systems.
Software RAID means the operating system is in charge of all RAID
functions. It works for small RAID solutions but tends to overwork your op-
erating system easily, creating slowdowns. When you really need to keep
going, when you need RAID that doesn’t even let the users know a problem
has occurred, hardware RAID is the answer.
Hardware RAID centers around an intelligent controller—either a SCSI
host adapter or an ATA controller that handles all of the RAID functions
(Figure 8.42). Unlike a regular ATA controller or SCSI host adapter, these
controllers have chips that know how to “talk RAID.”
128
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
You can use Disk Manage-
ment in Windows 2000 and Win-
dows XP Professional to create
RAID 1 and RAID 5 arrays, but
you can use Disk Management
only remotely on a server ver-
sion of Windows (2000 Server or
Server 2003). In other words, the
capability is there, but Microsoft
has limited the OS. If you want
to use software RAID in Win-
dows 2000 or XP (Home or Pro-
fessional), you need to use a
third-party tool to set it up.
• Figure 8.41
Disk Management in Windows Server 2003

Most RAID setups in the real world are hardware-based. Almost all of
the many hardware RAID solutions provide hot-swapping—the ability to re-
place a bad drive without disturbing the operating system. Hot-swapping is
common in hardware RAID.
Hardware-based RAID is invisible to the operating system and is config-
ured in several ways, depending on the specific chips involved. Most RAID
systems have a special configuration utility in Flash ROM that you access af-
ter CMOS but before the OS loads. Figure 8.43 shows a typical firmware pro-
gram used to configure a hardware RAID solution.
Personal RAID
Due to drastic reductions in the cost of ATA RAID controller chips, in
the last few years we’ve seen an explosion of ATA-based hardware RAID

solutions built into mainstream motherboards. While this “ATA RAID on
the motherboard” began with parallel ATA, the introduction of serial ATA
made motherboards with built-in RAID extremely common.
These personal RAID motherboards might be quite common, but
they’re not used too terribly often given that these RAID solutions usually
provide only RAID 0 or RAID 1. If you want to use RAID, spend a few extra
dollars and buy a RAID 5–capable controller.
The Future Is RAID
RAID has been with us for about 20 years, but until only recently it was the
domain of big systems and deep pockets. During those 20 years, however, a
number of factors have come together to make RAID a reality for both big
servers and common desktop systems. Imagine a world where dirt-cheap
RAID on every computer means no one ever again losing critical data. I get
goose bumps just thinking about it!
■Connecting Drives
Installing a drive is a fairly simple process if you take the time to make sure
you’ve got the right drive for your system, configure the drive properly,
and do a few quick tests to see if it’s running properly. Since PATA, SATA,
and SCSI have different cabling requirements, we’ll look at each of these
separately.
Choosing Your Drive
First, decide where you’re going to put the drive. Look for an open ATA
connection. Is it PATA or SATA? Is it a dedicated RAID controller? Many
motherboards with built-in RAID controllers have a CMOS setting that en-
ables you to turn the RAID on or off (Figure 8.44). Do you have the right con-
troller for a SCSI drive?
130
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
RAID controllers aren’t just
for internal drives; some models
can handle multiple eSATA
drives configured using any of
the different RAID levels. If
you’re feeling lucky, you can cre-
ate a RAID array using both in-
ternal and external SATA drives.
• Figure 8.44
Settings for RAID in CMOS

Second, make sure you have room for the drive in the case. Where will
you place it? Do you have a spare power connector? Will the data and power
cables reach the drive? A quick test fit is always a good idea.
Don’t worry about PIO Modes and DMA⎯a new drive will support
anything your controller wants to do.
Jumpers and Cabling
on PATA Drives
If you have only one hard drive, set the drive’s
jumpers to master or standalone. If you have two
drives, set one to master and the other to slave. See
Figure 8.45 for a close-up of a PATA hard drive
showing the jumpers.
At first glance, you might notice that the jump-
ers aren’t actually labeled master and slave. So how
do you know how to set them properly? The easi-
est way is to read the front of the drive; most
drives have a diagram on the housing that explains
how to set the jumpers properly. Figure 8.46 shows
the front of one of these drives, so you can see how
to set the drive to master or slave.
Hard drives may have other jumpers that may
or may not concern you during installation. One
common set of jumpers is used for diagnostics at
the manufacturing plant or for special settings in
other kinds of devices that use hard drives. Ignore
them. They have no bearing in the PC world. Second, many drives provide a
third setting, which is used if only one drive connects to a controller. Often,
master and single drive are the same setting on the hard drive, although
some hard drives require separate settings. Note that the name for the single
drive setting varies among manufacturers. Some use Single; others use 1
Drive or Standalone.
Many current PATA hard drives use a jumper setting called cable select,
rather than master or slave. As the name implies, the position on the cable
determines which drive will be master or slave: master on the end, slave in
the middle. For cable select to work properly with two drives, both
drives must be set as cable select and the cable itself must be a spe-
cial cable-select cable. If you see a ribbon cable with a pinhole
through one wire, watch out! That’s a cable-select cable.
If you don’t see a label on the drive that tells you how to set the
jumpers, you have several options. First, look for the drive maker’s
Web site. Every drive manufacturer lists its drive jumper settings on
the Web, although it can take a while to find the information you
want. Second, try phoning the hard drive maker directly. Unlike
many other PC parts manufacturers, hard drive producers tend to
stay in business for a long period of time and offer great technical
support.
Hard drive cables have a colored stripe that corresponds to the
number-one pin—called pin 1—on the connector. You need to make
Chapter 8: Hard Drive Technologies
131
• Figure 8.45
Master/slave jumpers on a hard drive

settings

66/100/133 cables support cable
select—try one and see!

certain that pin 1 on the controller
is on the same wire as pin 1 on the
hard drive. Failing to plug in the
drive properly will also prevent
the PC from recognizing the drive.
If you incorrectly set the master/
slave jumpers or cable to the hard
drives, you won’t break anything;
it just won’t work.
Finally, you need to plug a
Molex connector from the power supply into the drive. All modern PATA
drives use a Molex connector.
Cabling SATA Drives
Installing SATA hard drives is even easier than installing IDE devices due to
the fact that there’s no master, slave, or cable select configuration to mess
with. In fact, there are no jumper settings to worry about at
all, as SATA supports only a single device per controller
channel. Simply connect the power and plug in the control-
ler cable as shown in Figure 8.47—the OS automatically de-
tects the drive and it’s ready to go! The keying on SATA
controller and power cables makes it impossible to install
either incorrectly.
The biggest problem with SATA drives is that many
motherboards come with four or more. Sure, the cabling is
easy enough, but what do you do when it comes time to
start the computer and the system is trying to find the right
hard drive to boot up! That’s where CMOS comes into
play.
Connecting SCSI Drives
Connecting SCSI drives requires three things. You must
use a controller that works with your drive. You need to set
unique SCSI IDs on the controller and the drive. Finally,
you need to connect the ribbon cable and power connections properly. With
SCSI, you need to attach the data cable correctly. You can reverse a PATA
cable, for example, and nothing happens except the drive doesn’t work. If
you reverse a SCSI cable, however, you can seriously damage the drive. Just
as with PATA cables, pin 1 on the SCSI data cable must go to pin 1 on both
the drive and the host adapter.
■BIOS Support: Configuring CMOS
and Installing Drivers
Every device in your PC needs BIOS support, and the hard drive controllers
are no exception. Motherboards provide support for the ATA hard drive

Cross Check
Molex Connectors
Hard drives and other internal devices use Molex connectors for power.
Check your memory from the Essentials course. What voltages go
through the four wires on a Molex connector? What should you note
about the connector and inserting it into the corresponding socket on
the drive?
• Figure 8.47
Properly connected SATA cable

controllers via the system BIOS, but they require configuration in CMOS for
the specific hard drives attached. SCSI drives require software drivers or
firmware on the host adapter.
In the old days, you had to fire up CMOS and manually enter CHS infor-
mation whenever you installed a new ATA drive to ensure the system saw
the drive. Today, this process still takes place, but it’s much more auto-
mated. Still, there’s plenty to do in CMOS when you install a new hard
drive.
CMOS settings for hard drives vary a lot among motherboards. The fol-
lowing information provides a generic look at the most common settings,
but you’ll need to look at your specific motherboard manual to understand
all the options available.
Configuring Controllers
As a first step in configuring controllers, make certain they’re enabled. It’s
easy to turn off controllers in CMOS, and many motherboards turn off sec-
ondary ATA controllers by default. Scan through your CMOS settings to lo-
cate the controller on/off options (see Figure 8.48 for typical settings). This
is also the time to check whether your onboard RAID controllers work in
both RAID and non-RAID settings.
Autodetection
If the controllers are enabled and the drive is properly connected, the drive
should appear in CMOS through a process called autodetection. Autodetection
is a powerful and handy feature, but it seems every CMOS has a different
way to manifest it, and how it is manifested may affect how your computer
decides which hard drive to try to boot when you start your PC.
One of your hard drives stores the operating system needed when you
boot your computer, and your system needs a way to know where to look
for this operating system. The traditional BIOS supported a maximum of
only four ATA drives on two controllers, called the primary controller and the
secondary
controller.
The
BIOS
looked for the master drive on the
primary controller when the system
booted up. If you used only one
controller, you used the primary
controller. The secondary controller
was used for CD-ROMs, DVDs, or
other non-bootable drives.
Older CMOS made this clear
and easy, as shown in Figure 8.49.
When you booted up, the CMOS
would query the drives
through
autodetection, and whatever drives
the CMOS saw would show up
here. Some even older CMOS had a
special
menu
option
called
Autodetect that you had to run to

see the drives in this screen. There
are
places
for
up
to
four
de-
vices⎯notice not all of them actu-
ally have a device.
The autodetection screen indi-
cated that you installed a PATA
drive correctly. If you installed a
hard drive on the primary controller
as master, but messed up the jumper
and set it to slave, it would show up
in the autodetection screen as the
slave. If you had two drives and set
them both to master, one drive or the
other (or sometimes both) didn’t ap-
pear, telling you that something was
messed up in the physical installa-
tion. If you forgot to plug in the rib-
bon cable or the power, the drives
wouldn’t autodetect.
SATA messed up the autodetection happiness. There’s no such thing as
master, slave, or even primary and secondary controller in the SATA world.
To get around this, motherboards with PATA and SATA today use a num-
bering system⎯and every motherboard uses its own numbering system!
One common numbering method uses the term channels for each controller.
The first boot device is channel 1, the second is channel 2, and so on. PATA
channels may have a master and a slave, but a SATA channel has only a
master, as SATA controllers support only one drive. So instead of names of
drives, you see numbers. Take a look at Figure 8.50.
Whew! Lots of hard drives! This motherboard supports the traditional
four PATA drives, but it also supports four SATA drives. Each controller is
assigned a number⎯note that channel 1 and channel 2 have master/slave
settings, and that’s how you know channel 1 and 2 are the PATA drives.
Channels 3 through 6 are SATA, even though the listing says master.
(SATA’s still somewhat new, and a
CMOS using incorrect terms like
master is common.)
Boot Order
If you want your computer to run,
it’s going to need an operating sys-
tem to boot. While the PCs of our
forefathers (those of the 1980s and
early 1990s) absolutely required
you to put the operating system on
the primary master, most BIOS
makers by 1995 enabled you to put
the OS on any of the four drives and
then tell the system through CMOS
which hard drive to boot. Addition-
ally, you may need to boot from

New standard CMOS features

a floppy, CD-ROM, or even a thumb drive at times. CMOS takes
care of this by enabling you to set a boot order.
Figure 8.51 shows a typical boot order screen. It has a first, sec-
ond, and third boot option. Many users like to boot first from floppy
or CD-ROM, and then from a hard drive. This enables them to put in
a bootable floppy or CD-ROM if they’re having problems with the
system. Of course, you can set it to boot first from your hard drive
and then go into CMOS and change it when you need to⎯it’s your
choice.
Most modern CMOS lump the
hard drive boot order onto a sec-
ond screen. This screen works like
an autodetect in that it shows only
actual hard drives attached. This
beats the heck out of guessing!
Device Drivers
Devices that do not get BIOS via the
system BIOS routines naturally re-
quire some other source for BIOS.
For
ATAPI
devices
and
many
SATA controllers, the source of
choice is software device drivers,
but both technologies have a couple
of quirks you should know about.
ATAPI Devices and BIOS
ATAPI drives plug into an ATA controller on the motherboard and follow
the same conventions on cabling and jumpers used by PATA hard drives. In
fact, all current CMOS setup utilities seem to autodetect CD-media ATAPI
drives. If you go into CMOS after
installing a CD-ROM drive as mas-
ter on the secondary IDE controller,
for example, the drive will show up
just fine, as in Figure 8.52.
The
reporting
of
installed
CD-media drives in CMOS serves
two purposes. First, it tells the tech-
nician that he or she has good con-
nectivity
on
the
ATAPI
drive.
Second, it shows that you have the
option to boot to CD-media, such as
a Windows XP disc. What it doesn’t
do, however, is provide true BIOS
support for that drive! That has to
come
with
a
driver
loaded
at
boot-up.

Working with CMOS
One of the best ways to get your mind around the different drive stan-
dards and capabilities is to run benchmarking software on the hard
drive to get a baseline of its capabilities. Then, change CMOS settings to
alter the performance of the drive and run the diagnostics again. Try
this!
1.
Get a reliable hard drive benchmarking program. I recommend
HD Tach (www.simplisoftware.com) as reliable and rugged.
2.
Run the software, and record the scores.
3.
Change some or all of the following CMOS settings, and then
run the benchmarking utility again: PIO mode, DMA mode,
Block mode.
4.
What were the effects of changing settings?

■Troubleshooting Hard Drive
Installation
The best friend a tech has when it comes to troubleshooting hard drive in-
stallation is the autodetection feature of the CMOS setup utility. When a
drive doesn’t work, the biggest question, especially during installation, is,
“Did I plug it in correctly?” With autodetection, the answer is simple; if it
doesn’t see the drives, something is wrong with the hardware configura-
tion. Either a device has physically failed or, more likely, you didn’t give the
hard drive power, plugged a cable in backwards, or messed up some other
connectivity issue.
It takes four things to get a drive installed and recognized by the system:
jumpers (PATA only), data cable, power, and CMOS setup recognizing the
drive. If any of these steps is missed or messed up, you have a drive that
simply doesn’t exist according to the PC! To troubleshoot hard drives, sim-
ply work your way through each step to figure out what went wrong.
First, set the drive to master, slave, standalone, or cable select, depend-
ing on where you decide to install the drive. If a drive is alone on the cable,
set it to master or standalone. With two drives, one must be master and the
other slave. Alternatively, you can set both drives to cable select and use a
cable-select cable.
Second, the data cable must be connected to both the drive and control-
ler, Pin 1 to Pin 1. Reversing the data cable at one end is remarkably easy to
do, especially with the rounded cables. They obviously don’t have a big red
stripe down the side to indicate the location of Pin 1! If you can’t autodetect
the drive, check the cabling.
Third, be sure to give the hard drive power. Most hard drives use a stan-
dard Molex connector. If you don’t hear the whirring of the drive, make cer-
tain you plugged in a Molex from the power supply, rather than from
another source such as an otherwise disconnected fan. You’d be surprised
how often I’ve seen that!
Fourth, you need to provide BIOS for the controller and the drive. This
can get tricky as the typical CMOS setup program has a lot of hard drive op-
tions. Plus, you have an added level of confusion with RAID settings and
non-integrated controllers that require software drivers.
Once you’ve checked the physical connections, run through these issues
in CMOS. Is the controller enabled? Is the storage technology—LBA, INT13,
ATA/ATAPI-6—properly set up? Similarly, can the motherboard support
the type of drive you’re installing? If not, you have a couple of options. You
can flash the BIOS with an upgraded BIOS from the manufacturer or you
can get a hard drive controller that goes into an expansion slot.
Finally, make certain with non-integrated hard drive controllers, such as
those that come with many SATA drives, that you’ve installed the proper
drivers for the controller. Driver issues can crop up with new, very large
drives, and with changes in technology. Always check the manufacturer’s
Web site for new drivers.

Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
The CompTIA A+ 220-603
exam is interested in trouble-
shooting storage devices, but
more from the software side
than the physical installation
angle.

Beyond A+
Spindle (or Rotational) Speed
Hard drives run at a set spindle speed, measured in revolutions per minute
(RPM). Older drives run at the long-standard speed of 3600 RPM, but new
drives are hitting 15,000 RPM! The faster the spindle speed, the faster the
controller can store and retrieve data. Here are the common speeds: 4500,
5400, 7200, and 10,000 RPM.
Faster drives mean better system performance, but they can also cause
the computer to overheat. This is especially true in tight cases, such as
minitowers, and in cases containing many drives. Two 4500 RPM drives
might run forever, snugly tucked together in your old case. But slap a hot
new 10,000 RPM drive in that same case and watch your system start crash-
ing right and left!
You can deal with these hotrod drives by adding drive bay fans between
the drives or migrating to a more spacious case. Most enthusiasts end up do-
ing both. Drive bay fans sit at the front of a bay and blow air across the drive.
They range in price from $10 to $100 (U.S.) and can lower the temperature of
your drives dramatically. Figure 8.53 shows a picture of a double-fan drive
bay cooler.
Air flow in a case can make or break your system
stability, especially when you add new drives that
increase the ambient temperature. Hot systems get
flaky and lock up at odd moments. Many things can
impede the air flow—jumbled up ribbon cables,
drives squished together in a tiny case, fans clogged
by dust or animal hair, and so on.
Technicians need to be aware of the dangers
when adding a new hard drive to an older system.
Get into the habit of tying off ribbon cables, adding
front fans to cases when systems lock up intermit-
tently, and making sure the fan(s) run well. Finally,
if a client wants a new drive and his system is a tiny
minitower with only the power supply fan to cool it
off, be gentle, but definitely steer him to one of the
slower drives!
Hybrid Hard Drives
Windows Vista supports hybrid hard drives (HHDs), drives that combine
flash memory and spinning platters to provide fast and reliable storage.
Samsung has drives with 128-MB and 256-MB flash cache, for example, that
shave boot times in half and, because the platters don’t have to spin all the
time, add 20–30 minutes more of battery life for portable computers. Add-
ing that much more run time with only a tiny price premium and no extra
weight is the Holy Grail of portable computing!

Chapter 8 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
hard drive technologies.
How Hard Drives Work
■
Hard drives contain aluminum platters coated
with a magnetic medium and read/write heads
that float on a cushion of air. Hard drives store
data in a tiny magnetic field called a flux that
defines a zero or a one. The switching back and
forth of the field is called flux reversal. The
incredible storage capacity of today’s drives is due
to Partial Response Maximum Likelihood (PRML)
encoding that includes intelligent circuitry to
analyze each flux reversal.
■
Two different technologies have been used to move
read/write heads across the platters: stepper
motors and voice coil. Very susceptible to physical
deterioration and temperature changes, the now
obsolete stepper motors moved the actuator arm in
fixed increments or steps, often resulting in data
transfer errors or the inability to access data on a
cold drive. The heads had to be parked to a
non-data area when not in use to prevent possible
damage to the disk surface. Today’s drives use a
linear or voice coil motor consisting of a permanent
magnet surrounding a coil on the actuator arm.
Electrical current causes the coil to generate a
magnetic field that moves the actuator arm and
thus the read/write heads. Containing no data, one
side of one platter is used as a map to position the
heads directly over the data. Voice coil technology
automatically parks the heads when the drive loses
power.
■
Disk geometry for a particular hard drive consists of
three primary values: heads, cylinders, and sectors
per track. There are two read/write heads per
platter. A hard drive can have either an even or an
odd number of heads. A cylinder defines a group of
tracks of the same diameter. Each track is sliced into
tiny slivers called sectors, each of which stores
512 bytes of data. Disk geometry uses the number of
sectors per track. Combining cylinders, heads, and
sectors per track is referred to as CHS. Write
precompensation and landing zone, two other
geometric values, have no relevance in today’s
PCs, but most CMOS utilities still support them.
ATA—The King
■
Today’s hard drives have either an ATA interface
or a SCSI interface. ATA drives may be parallel
ATA (PATA) or the newer serial ATA (SATA).
A specification of the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI), the AT Attachment
(ATA) interface (commonly but incorrectly referred
to as IDE) used a 40-pin ribbon cable, had a built-in
controller, and did not require a low-level format.
By 1995, EIDE was the dominant interface. Its
features include higher capacities, support for
non–hard drive storage devices, a four device
maximum, and improved throughput. The terms
ATA, IDE, and EIDE are used interchangeably to
describe all PATA devices.
■
PATA drives use a 40-pin plug and a controller that
connects them to the external data bus. Although
the real controller is built into the hard drive itself,
the 40-pin connector on the motherboard is
called the controller. Most modern motherboards
contain two PATA controllers, each capable of
supporting up to two PATA devices. By looking at
the motherboard itself or at the motherboard book,
you can determine which is the primary controller
and which is the secondary. If you are using only
one controller, it should be the primary one.
■
The Advanced Technology Attachment Packet
Interface (ATAPI) enables non–hard drive devices
to use a PATA controller. ATAPI devices, such as
CD-ROM drives, use the same 40-pin interface and
follow the same rules of master, slave, and cable
select jumper settings. Non–hard drives must get
their BIOS from option RAM or a software driver.
■
Originally, IDE drives used the same BIOS command
set introduced years earlier. Maximum values of
1024 cylinders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors per track
limited an IDE drive’s capacity to 528 million bytes
(504 MB). Western Digital developed the LBA
sector translation method to accommodate larger
EIDE drives. LBA supports drives with up to
256 heads, for a storage capacity limit of 8.4 GB.
138
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

■
As drive capacity neared the 8.4-GB maximum,
Phoenix Technologies broke the limit by coming up
with a new set of BIOS commands called Interrupt
13 extensions (INT13). Completely ignoring the CHS
values, INT13 supports drives up to 137 GB by
reporting a stream of “addressable sectors” to LBA.
■
As drive capacity neared the 137-GB limit, the
ANSI ATA committee adopted ATA/ATAPI-6, a
new standard that increased the limit to more than
144 petabytes (144,000,000 GB). It uses a 48-bit
addressing scheme and an enhanced block mode
that transfers up to 65,536 sectors at a time.
■
Newer hard drives use direct memory access
(DMA) mode to send data directly to RAM,
bypassing the CPU. Instead of using the slow
DMA controller chip, today’s DMA transfers use
bus mastering to transfer 32 bits of data. Hard
drives typically use one of the following modes:
Ultra DMA mode 4 (ATA/66), Ultra DMA mode 5
(ATA/100), and Ultra DMA mode 6 (ATA/133).
To use Ultra DMA, you must have a controller and
an 80-wire ribbon cable. Some motherboards
combine different speeds of ATA controllers, with
the higher speed controller indicated with a bright
color. The 80-wire ribbon cable indicates where the
master and slave drives should be connected.
High-end PATA devices can use lower end
controllers, but they will operate at the slower
speed.
■
Serial ATA (SATA) devices look identical to
standard PATA devices (except their data and
power connectors), but their thinner seven-wire
cables provide better airflow and may be up to a
meter (39.4 inches) long. SATA does away with the
entire master/slave concept. Each drive connects to
one port, so no more daisy-chaining drives.
■
SATA devices are hot-swappable, great for RAID
technology. SATA transfers data in serial bursts,
for up to 30 times the throughput of PATA. SATA
drives come in two common varieties, the 1.5Gb
and the 3Gb, that have a maximum throughput of
150 MBps and 300 MBps, respectively.
SCSI: Still Around
■
All SCSI chains, which support either 8 or 16
devices including the controller, require proper
termination to prevent signal echo. Additionally,
each device on a chain requires a unique SCSI ID,
which can be set by jumpers, switches, or dials.
■
All SCSI devices can be divided into two groups:
internal and external. Internal SCSI devices connect
to the host adapter with a 68-pin ribbon cable.
External devices connect to the host adapter with
either a 50-pin HD connector or a 68-pin HD
connector. SCSI enables you to daisy-chain devices
together to form longer SCSI chains.
■
Improper termination or incorrect SCSI ID settings
are the two most common causes of SCSI devices
not working. The key factor here is that you must
terminate only the ends of the SCSI chain.
Protecting Data with RAID
■
Drive mirroring writes data simultaneously to two
hard drives, enabling the system to continue to
work if one hard drive dies. A faster and even
more effective technique is drive duplexing, which
performs mirroring using separate controllers for
each drive. A third way to create redundant data is
disk striping with parity. This technique, requiring
at least three drives, combines the redundancy of
disk mirroring with the speed of disk striping.
Although disk striping without parity works very
fast, splitting the data across two drives means
you’ll lose all data if either drive fails.
■
Numbered 0 through 6, there are seven official
levels of RAID, but the most commonly used ones
are RAID 0 (disk striping), RAID 1 (disk mirroring
or duplexing), and RAID 5 (disk striping with
distributed parity).
■
RAID may be implemented through hardware or
software methods. While software implementation is
cheaper, hardware techniques provide better
performance. Windows 2000 Server and Windows
2003 Server include built-in RAID software for
RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 5 for either ATA or SCSI.
Windows 2000 and XP Professional include Disk
Management for RAID 0. RAID software solutions
tend to overwork your operating system, resulting in
slowdowns. Hardware RAID is invisible to the OS and
is usually hot-swappable. A hardware ATA RAID
controller usually requires CMOS configuration. Many
motherboards include built-in ATA-based hardware
RAID 0 and RAID 1 capabilities.
■
SCSI drives were a natural for the multiple-disk
RAID. Specialized ATA RAID controller cards
support ATA RAID arrays of up to 15 drives. With
its hot-swap capabilities, SATA may soon take over
lower end RAID from SCSI.
Chapter 8: Hard Drive Technologies
139

Connecting Drives
■
Older PATA drives use a 40-wire cable, while the
newer Ultra DMA drives use an 80-wire cable.
Either round or flat and containing no twists, each
ribbon cable supports two drives. A diagram on
the hard drive’s housing shows how to set its
jumpers to identify it as master, slave, standalone
(on some drives), or cable select (cable position
determines whether the drive will be master or
slave). Two devices on one cable must both be set
to cable select, and the cable itself must also be
cable select, as indicated with a pinhole through
one wire. Align the colored stripe on the cable with
pin 1 on the controller and the drive. Use a Molex
connector to provide power to the drive.
■
SATA supports only a single device per controller
channel, so there are no master, slave, or cable
select jumpers. SATA controller and power cables
are keyed to prevent incorrect insertion. You can
connect a PATA device to a SATA motherboard
controller by way of a SATA bridge.
BIOS Support: Configuring CMOS
and Installing Drivers
■
While system BIOS supports built-in PATA
controllers, hard drives require configuration in
CMOS. ATAPI devices require software drivers to
provide BIOS support. Built-in SATA controllers
on a motherboard also require software drivers, as
does a SATA controller on a separate expansion
card. All SATA devices get BIOS support from the
SATA controller, but some drives require
additional configuration; in particular, with RAID
systems, you may also have to configure the
controller Flash ROM settings for the specific
drive(s) you install.
■
When the hard drive type is set to “Auto,” PATA
devices can be queried directly by BIOS routines,
resulting in the correct CMOS settings for up to
four ATA devices. Autodetection made hard drive
types obsolete. Because PATA drives have CHS
values stored inside them, the BIOS routine, when
set to “Auto,” updates the CMOS each time the
computer boots. An alternative is to run the
autodetection option from the CMOS screen.
■
Even if the autodetect feature indicates that an
optical ATAPI drive has been installed, this merely
shows that the drive is connected properly and has
the option to function as a boot device. This
autodetection does not provide true BIOS support.
You must still install drivers to provide the BIOS. If
the driver is installed in a graphical mode, you will
be unable to access the drive if you boot to a
command prompt–only environment.
■
It takes four things to get a drive installed and
recognized by the system: jumpers, data cable,
power, and CMOS setup or providing BIOS. If any
of these steps is missed or messed up, your drive
simply doesn’t exist according to the PC.
■
If the autodetection feature of the CMOS utility
does not detect a drive, it means it is installed
incorrectly or the drive itself is bad. Check the
master/slave jumper settings. Make sure that the
ribbon cable aligns pin 1 with pin 1, and that the
Molex connector is supplying power to the drive.
■
Once you’ve checked the physical connections, run
through these issues in CMOS. Is the controller
enabled? Is the storage technology—LBA, Large,
INT13, ATA/ATAPI-6—properly set up? What
about the data transfer settings for PIO and DMA
modes? Similarly, can the motherboard support the
type of drive you’re installing? If not, you can flash
the BIOS or get a hard drive controller that goes
into an expansion slot. Make certain with
non-integrated hard drive controllers, such as
those that come with many SATA drives, that
you’ve installed the proper drivers for the
controller. Always check the manufacturer’s Web
site for new drivers.

Lab Projects
• Lab Project 8.1
Access the CMOS setup for your computer and
examine the settings that apply to your hard drive(s)
and EIDE interface. In particular, look at the initial
screen to see if it is set to autodetect the kind of hard
drive. Is the mode set to LBA or something else?
Now find the screen that includes the autodetect
utility and run it. Does it offer different modes with
different drive capacities? Try to find a screen that
includes PIO modes and examine this setting. What
other screens apply to the hard drive? When you
finish, be sure to choose Quit without Saving.
• Lab Project 8.2
Visit your local computer store or use the Internet to
discover what kinds of hard drives and hard drive
interfaces are commonly offered with a new computer.
Try to determine whether the motherboards offer only
parallel ATA interfaces or if they offer serial ATA
interfaces, either onboard or through an expansion
card. If you were purchasing a new computer, would
you select PATA or SATA? Why?

emovable media has traditionally been the primary method to store and
trade data and to install large applications for PCs. Although Internet
installation now makes up a substantial part of the storage and trade business
(many programs are easily downloaded right to a PC), removable media still has
an important job in backups and—most important to techs like us—bootability.
There’s no PC ever made that isn’t designed to boot from a floppy disk, optical
disc, or even a USB thumb drive. Without a way for techs to boot an operating
system, we’d never be able to install a copy of Windows on a shiny new system
or run boot disk utilities to test and repair an ailing computer.
This chapter focuses on two types of removable-media drives: the old
floppy drives and optical drives (CDs and DVDs). Here you will install CD-ROM
and DVD drives. Then you will learn how to keep floppy and optical drives
running smoothly.

■Installing Optical Drives
From ten feet away, CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-RW, and DVD+RW
drives look absolutely identical. Figure 9.1 shows a CD-ROM, CD-RW, and
a DVD drive. Can you tell them apart just by a glance? In case you were
wondering, the CD-RW is on the top, the CD-ROM is in the center, and the
DVD is on the bottom. If you look closely at an optical drive, its function is
normally either stamped on the front of the case or printed on a label some-
where less obvious (see Figure 9.2).
Connections
Most optical drives use PATA or SATA connections and support the ATAPI
standard. (Other connections, such as SCSI and USB, are possible but less com-
mon.) ATAPI treats an optical drive exactly as though it were an ATA drive.

• Figure 9.1
CD-ROM, CD-RW, and DVD

PATA optical drives have regular 40-pin IDE connectors and master/slave
jumpers , just like IDE hard drives. SATA optical drives use standard
SATA cables. You install them the same way you would install any ATA
hard drive. Figure 9.3 shows a typical DVD installation using PATA. The
DVD is configured as slave with a master hard drive on a system’s primary
IDE controller.

ATAPI drives require no CMOS changes as part of the install process.
When the industry first introduced ATAPI drives, techs familiar with
hard-drive installations swamped the CD-ROM makers’ service depart-
ments asking how to set up the drives in CMOS. To reduce these calls, BIOS
makers added a CD-ROM option in many CMOS setup utilities, just to give
the techs something to do! You can find this option in many older CMOS
setup utilities. This setting actually didn’t do anything at all; it just kept us-
ers from bothering the CD-ROM makers with silly support calls. Modern
motherboards report the actual model numbers of optical drives, giving a
tech a degree of assurance that he or she configured and installed the drive
correctly (Figure 9.4).
Device Manager
When you install a new CD-ROM into an existing system, the first question
to ask is, “Does Windows recognize my CD-ROM?” You can determine this
by opening the My Computer icon and verifying that a CD-ROM is present
(see Figure 9.5). When you want to know more, go to Device Manager.
Device Manager contains most of the information about the CD-ROM.
The General tab tells you about the current status of the CD-ROM, basically
saying whether the device is working properly or not—rather less useful
than actually trying the device. Other tabs, such as the Driver tab shown in
Figure 9.6, provide other pertinent information about the drive.

Cross Check
Master/Slave Settings
You normally set up an ATAPI optical drive as a slave to a hard
drive master. You learned about master and slave settings for PATA
drives in Chapter 8, “Hard Drive Technologies.”

What are the various ways that you can determine which drive
on an IDE controller acts as slave and which acts as master?
2.
What factors should you consider when deciding where to
install an optical drive, either as a master or as a slave? Any
difference in your answer for a system with one hard drive
versus one with two hard drives?
Tech Tip
External
Optical Drives
Almost all new PCs have one or
both external expansion buses,
USB and FireWire, and the mak-
ers of optical drives have quickly
taken this fact to heart. Many
manufacturers have released ex-
ternal versions of CD and DVD
drives, both readers and burners.
Of the two expansion options, I
prefer FireWire simply because
it’s the standard for most digital
video cameras and the 400 Mbps
sustained data transfer rate eas-
ily trumps the Hi-Speed USB 480
Mbps burst rate for transferring
huge files.
The only benefit to the USB
versions is that USB is still more
common than FireWire, particu-
larly on portable computers. In
fact, quite a few super-light
laptops don’t have an optical
drive built in; the only way to
load an OS on them is through an
external drive! (Note that some
external drives for laptops con-
nect via the IEEE1284 DB 25
parallel port.) If you can’t decide
which expansion type to use, sev-
eral manufacturers have taken
pity on you.
• Figure 9.4
Autodetect settings for two optical drives

Auto Insert Notification
Another setting of note is the Auto Insert Notification option, often referred
to as AutoPlay in Windows 2000/XP. This setting enables Windows to de-
tect automatically the presence of audio or data CD-ROMs when they are
placed in the drive.
Windows 2000 and Windows XP have very different ways of dealing
with AutoPlay. In Windows 2000, if the CD is an audio disc, track 1 plays
automatically. If the CD-ROM is a data disc, Windows searches the disc’s
root directory for a special text file called AUTORUN.INF .
Although handy, this option can sometimes be annoying and unproduc-
tive. Windows 2000 does not provide a simple method to turn off AutoPlay.
The only way to turn it off is to edit the registry. You can use the REGEDT32
version of the Registry Editor and do it directly. In REGEDT32, access this
subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Cdrom
Change Autorun 0 × 1 to 0 × 0.
Most techs will use Group Policy to make the change because it gives
you much more control in multiple CD and DVD drive situations. With
Group Policy, you can turn off AutoPlay on your CD-RW drive, for exam-
ple, but leave it enabled for your DVD drive. Group Policy is a very power-
ful tool that goes well beyond CompTIA A+, so be careful with what you’re
about to do. To run Group Policy, go to Start | Run and type gpedit.msc in
the Run dialog box. Click OK to open the MMC. To turn off AutoPlay, navi-
gate down in the menu to the left as follows: Local Computer Policy | Com-
puter Configuration | Administrative Templates. Select the System option
and you’ll see the Turn off Autoplay option in the Setting section on the right
pane of the MMC (Figure 9.7).

Double-click or right-click Turn off Autoplay to open the
Properties. Note in Figure 9.8 that the default option is Not Con-
figured, but you can enable or disable it here. The words are
messy here, so make sure you know what you’re doing. Enabling
Turn off Autoplay gives you the option to stop an optical drive
from automatically playing a disc. Disabling Turn off Autoplay
prevents you or any other user from stopping any optical drive
from automatically playing a disc. Got the distinction?
Windows XP provides a much more sophisticated and sim-
pler approach to AutoPlay. By default, when you insert a CD- or
DVD-media disc that doesn’t have an AUTORUN.INF file, XP
asks you what you want to do (Figure 9.9). You can change the
default behavior simply by accessing the properties for a partic-
ular drive in My Computer and making your selection on the
AutoPlay tab. Figure 9.10 shows some of the options for a typical
Windows XP machine.
As a final note, Windows 2000 and XP enable you to change
the drive letter for an optical drive, just like you can change the
letter of a hard drive. You’ll find that option in Disk Manage-
ment (Figure 9.11).
Applications
A regular CD-ROM drive installation involves no applications. You install
it, Windows sees it, and you’re done. CD-R and CD-RW drives, in contrast,
require applications to enable their burning features. DVD-media drives

grams. If you’re looking for a free burner, try CDBurnerXP Pro, pictured
in Figure 9.12 (www.cdburnerxp.se). Windows XP contains basic CD-burn-
ing capabilities built into the operating system. With XP, you can readily

PC to PC. Almost all optical drives will read the discs burned in an XP
system.
Windows Media Player that comes free with Windows makes an excel-
lent DVD-watching application, but for DVD burning you need to turn to a
third-party tool. Nero and Roxio make excellent software that handles every
DVD recordable standard (as well as CD-R and CD-RW) that your drive can
use.
Ever wanted to make a perfect copy of a CD so that you can keep your
original in a safe place? You can do so using a special file type called an ISO
file. An ISO file is a complete copy⎯an ISO image as we say⎯of a CD. As
you might imagine, they are huge files, but they are also very important to
techs. Techs use ISO images to send each other copies of bootable utility
CDs. For example, if you want a copy of the Ultimate Boot CD, you go to
their Web site and download an ISO image. You then take your third-party
burning program (Windows XP built-in burning software can’t do this) and
go through a special process called burning an ISO image. Learn how to
burn ISO images with your burning program; you’ll use it all the time!

Burning Digital Music Files to a CD
Almost all computers and many portable CD players now have the abil-
ity to play recordable CDs loaded with MP3 files. This enables you to
mix songs from your music collection and fit a lot of songs on a disc
(MP3s are smaller than CD-audio files). That’s a great feature—but
where do digital audio files come from and how do you put them on
a CD?
You can create MP3s from your favorite CDs by using a ripper. A rip-
per is a piece of software that takes standard CD-audio files and com-
presses them, using specialized algorithms, into much smaller files
while maintaining most of the audio qualities of the original file. One le-
gal note, however—you should only make MP3s from CDs that you
have purchased. Borrowing a CD from a friend and ripping MP3s from
it is illegal! Likewise, downloading MP3s from unauthorized sources on
the Internet is also illegal. You don’t want to go to jail because you just
had to listen to the latest, greatest single from your favorite artist, right?
Now that I’ve taken care of the legal disclaimer, get ready to rip your
MP3s. You need three things—a recordable/rewritable optical drive,
some CD authoring software, and of course, a blank disc. I recommend
a CD-R. (Audio-only devices stand a much better chance of playing a
CD-R successfully rather than a CD-RW.)
1.
Confirm that you have a CD-R/RW drive installed in your
computer. You don’t have to have a drive like this in order to rip
audio files from a CD, but you must have one in order to burn
digital audio to a CD-R.
2.
Launch your favorite CD authoring software. Popular titles in
this category include Nero Burning ROM and Easy CD Creator.
3.
Most CD authoring programs use a simple drag-and-drop
interface, similar to the Windows Explorer interface. Browse to
the location of the audio files and select them. Then drag them
into the appropriate area—this is often called the queue.
4.
After you’ve selected all the files you want to have on your CD,
it’s time to burn! The procedure for initiating the CD-burning
sequence is different for each program. You should always make
sure to close the CD after you’ve burned it. Most standalone CD
players (even ones that play MP3s) won’t play CD-Rs that
haven’t been closed.
Once you get all the configuration information keyed in, just sit back
and watch the fireworks. Always be sure to use CD-media that is rated
appropriately for your drive, for both speed and media type. In no time
at all, you’ll be listening to MP3s while jogging around the park!

■Troubleshooting Removable Media
Floppy disk drives, flash memory, and optical drives are fairly robust de-
vices that rarely require troubleshooting due to an actual hardware failure.
Most problems with removable media stem from lack of knowledge, im-
proper installation, abuse, and incorrect use of associated applications.
There’s no way to repair a truly broken flash memory⎯once a flash card
dies, you replace it—so let’s concentrate on troubleshooting floppy drives
and CD- and DVD-media drives.
Floppy Drive Maintenance and
Troubleshooting
No single component fails more often than the floppy drive. This is not re-
ally that surprising because floppy drives have more exposure to the out-
side environment than anything but the keyboard. Only a small door (or in
the case of 5¼-inch drives, not even a door) divides the read/write heads
from dust and grime. Floppy drives are also exposed to the threat of me-
chanical damage. Many folks destroy floppy drives by accidentally insert-
ing inverted disks, paper clips, and other foreign objects. Life is tough for
floppy drives!
In the face of this abuse, the key preventive maintenance performed on
floppy drives is cleaning. You can find floppy drive cleaning kits at some
electronics stores, or you can use a cotton swab and some denatured alcohol
to scour gently inside the drive for dust and other particles.
Repairing Floppy Drives
When a floppy drive stops working, follow these steps to resolve the problem:
1.
Check for a bad floppy disk.
2.
Check for data errors on the disk.
3.
Check the CMOS settings.
4.
Blame the floppy controller.
5.
Check the cable.
6.
Replace the floppy drive.
First, Check the Floppy Disk
The vast majority of the time, when the floppy drive decides it won’t read a
floppy disk, the bad guy is the floppy disk, not the floppy drive. When the
floppy drive refuses to read a floppy disk, you usually get an error like the
one shown in Figure 9.13.
If you get this error, first try inserting another floppy disk. If a new disk
from a fresh box won’t work, don’t insert another one from the same box.
Find another disk, preferably from another box or one just lying around,
to retest. If the floppy drive refuses to read two floppy disks, then suspect
the floppy drive is the problem. Otherwise, blame the disk!

• Figure 9.13
Floppy disk read error

Second, Check for Data Errors on the Disk
If other floppy disks work in the drive, the floppy disk has a problem. If a
floppy disk fails, you have three options. First, just throw it away. Second,
reformat the floppy disk. The only downside to these two options is that you
lose the data on the floppy disk, and sometimes that is not an acceptable op-
tion. Your third option is to run some sort of recovery/fixing software on
the disk.
Floppy disks come preformatted from the manufacturer. We reformat
floppies for one of two reasons: either as a handy way to completely erase
a floppy disk or as a last-ditch effort to try to fix a bad floppy. To reformat a
floppy disk in any version of Windows, go to My Computer and right-click
the floppy icon. Select Format to see the dialog box shown in Figure 9.14.
Note that in Windows XP, although the first three settings appear to be
pull-down menus, you don’t actually get any format options besides the
ones showing. In Windows 2000, the Capacity pull-down menu does let you
format the floppy as an ancient 720 KB as well as a modern 1.44 MB type.
The Format Type radio button group enables you to choose between Quick
Format (just erases data), or Create an MS-DOS Startup Disk (don’t format
the floppy—save the data, just make it bootable). You can add a Volume La-
bel, which simply enables you to place a small amount of text on the floppy
to help describe the contents. Volume labels were quite popular in the DOS
days but are almost never used today.
The third option (recovery software) may save the data—and possibly
the disk! A bad floppy disk often holds data that you need. Don’t panic! Un-
less the floppy disk has substantial physical damage—for example, your

Tech Tip
Check Inside the Drive
Sometimes pieces of a floppy
disk—the metal shutter, for ex-
ample, or the spring—can get
jammed into the drive by users
who keep trying to shove a disk
into the drive. The user won’t no-
tice anything different except that
the disk doesn’t work and some-
times sticks in the drive. If you
have any trouble inserting the
floppy disk, take a flashlight and
peer inside the drive to check for
stray bits that don’t belong!

Creating a Windows 98 Startup Disk
If you have a computer system running Windows 98, you should have a
startup disk you can boot from when your computer locks up and won’t
boot normally. Grab a blank floppy disk and try this:
1.
Open the Control Panel from the Start menu. Double-click on
the Add/Remove Programs icon to start that applet. Select the
Startup Disk tab and click the Create Disk button.
2.
Insert a floppy disk when prompted. Windows will create a
bootable floppy by formatting the disk and adding certain key
files that will enable Windows to boot from it. When the process
is finished, remove the floppy and label it Windows 98 Startup
Disk.
3.
Restart the system with the Startup disk inserted. You should
see a Windows startup screen with several boot options. Select
Start Computer with CD-ROM support, and watch the boot
process progress to the A:\> prompt. Remove the startup disk
and reboot into Windows.

dog chewed on it for 20 minutes—certain utility programs can retrieve the
data. The process for repairing floppy disks is identical to the process for
repairing hard drives.
Third, Check the CMOS Settings
CMOS settings for floppy drives rarely cause problems. All BIOS makers
default the CMOS settings for the A: drive to 3½-inch high density if the
CMOS is accidentally erased. So although an erased CMOS might keep ev-
erything else on your computer from running, at least the floppy will still
work (assuming you have a 3½-inch A: drive). The rare instances of a prob-
lem with CMOS can be dangerous because technicians rarely look there.
Double-check the CMOS: A quick peek can save a lot of time!
Next, Blame the Floppy Controller
If the data cable or power plug is loose, the POST will flag with either “FDD
Controller Failure” or “Drive Not Ready” errors. At this point, open the ma-
chine and verify the connections. If the connections are good, it’s possible
that your motherboard has a bad floppy drive controller. Checking the
floppy drive controller requires two basic steps. First, turn off the onboard
controller. To turn off the controller, go into CMOS and find the Onboard
FDD Controller option (or something like that), shown in Figure 9.15, and
disable it. Some motherboards don’t give you the option to do this, in which
case you need to disable the controller in Device Manager.
Second, go to the computer store (hooray!) and buy one of two items. On
the off chance that the store has a PCI FDD controller card, pick it up. You
can install it and plug in the floppy drive. If the drive then works, suspect
the onboard controller. If the floppy drive still doesn’t work, remove the
card and re-enable the CMOS setting for the onboard controller.
Alternatively, you can get an external USB floppy drive (Figure 9.16).
This won’t give you a bootable floppy drive, but you can bypass the internal
components altogether and access it in Windows. Figure 9.17 shows
My Computer in a system with only a USB FDD installed. Note that the USB

device shows up as D:, but that you have the option of clicking on
the A: drive as well. Clicking on either drive icon will access the
same floppy disk.
Maybe It’s the Cable …
Your next investigation should focus on whether the cable is the culprit. The
34th wire on the floppy-drive cable is called the drive change signal (or disk
change signal). When a floppy disk is inserted or removed, this wire is ac-
tive. When Windows first reads a floppy disk, it keeps a copy of the direc-
tory in RAM and will not update that information unless the floppy drive
detects a disk removal and activates the drive change signal. This keeps the
system from constantly accessing the very slow floppy drive. Windows
waits until it knows it needs to reread the disk. However, if the drive change
signal disconnects because of a bent pin or bad cable, you will keep seeing
the same directory, even if you change the disk! This problem almost always
traces back to a bad floppy cable, so replace it and retry.
Connectivity plays a big (and sometimes embarrassing) role in floppy
drive failure. One of the most common errors techs make installing floppy
drives is reversing the ribbon cable on one or both ends. If you reverse it on
one end, invariably the LED on the drive (the light) comes on the moment
you turn on the system and stays on. Always check the light on the floppy
drive when installing a new floppy! If you reverse the cable on both ends, the
LED will not come on at all—most of the time. Usually, you will get an FDD
error at POST, and the drive simply will not work. As mentioned earlier,
newer systems key the floppy drive connector and ribbon cable to minimize
this issue, but no rule requires the floppy drive manufacturers to abide by

Last, Replace the Floppy Drive
At this point, if the floppy drive isn’t working, the only recourse is to replace
the drive. When you replace a bad drive, throw it away. Keeping a bad

floppy drive is a study in frustration because almost all bad floppy drives
aren’t consistently bad—just sometimes bad. Technicians are often tempted
to give a bad floppy drive one more chance. They install the drive, and it
works! They’re convinced they made a mistake and declare the drive good.
If the drive is reinstalled somewhere else, however, it will soon die again.
Throw it away.
Floppy drives fail more than any other part of a computer system. In any
five PCs, at least one floppy drive will need to be replaced in a year. So keep
floppy drives in stock. Purchase them in quantity, at least five at a time, so
you’ll receive a discount. Buying floppy drives one at a time is expensive
and a waste of time.
Troubleshooting Optical Drives and Discs
Optical drives are extremely reliable and durable PC components.There are
times, however, when a reliable and durable device decides to turn into an
unreliable, non-durable pile of plastic and metal frustration. This section
covers a few of the more common problems with optical drives and
discs—installation issues, burning issues, and firmware updates—and how
to fix them.
Installation Issues
The single biggest problem with optical drives, especially in a new installa-
tion, is the connection. Your first guess should be that the drive has not
been properly installed in some way. A few of the common culprits are for-
getting to plug in a power connector, inserting a cable backward, and
misconfiguring jumpers/switches. Although you need to know the type of
drive, the test for an improper physical connection is always the same: using
BIOS to see whether the system can see the optical drive.
The way in which a BIOS detects an optical
drive depends on the system. Most BIOS makers
have created intelligent BIOS software that can see
an installed optical drive. Figure 9.18 shows a mod-
ern Award Software, Inc., BIOS recognizing a
CD-RW during startup.
If the device is detected in BIOS, Windows will
recognize the drive and you’ll see it in My Com-
puter and Device Manager.
If the drive won’t read a CD-R or CD-RW disc,
first try a commercial CD-ROM disc that is in good
condition. CD-R and CD-RW discs sometimes have
compatibility issues with CD-ROM drives. The
same goes for a DVD-RW or any other writable DVD disc in your DVD drive.
As noted earlier, DVD drives have issues with media incompatibility. Also,
no optical drive will read badly scratched discs.
If the drive still does not see a disc, try cleaning the drive. Most modern
optical drives have built-in cleaning mechanisms, but from time to time, you
need to use a commercial optical-drive cleaning kit (see Figure 9.19).
Optical drives are not cleaned too often, but the discs are. Although a
number of fine optical disc cleaning kits are available, most discs can be

cleaned quite well with nothing more than a damp soft cloth. Occasionally,
a mild detergent can be added. Always wipe from the center of the optical
disc to the edge—never clean a CD or DVD using a circular motion! A com-
mon old tech’s tale about cleaning optical discs is that they can be washed in
a dishwasher! Although this may seem laughable, the tale has become so
common that it requires a serious response. This is not true for two reasons:
First, the water in most dishwashers is too hot and can cause the discs to
warp. Second, the water pushes the discs around, causing them to hit other
objects and get scratched. Don’t do it!
The final problem with optical drives—stuck discs—comes from tech-
nician error and is not actually the fault of the drives. I can’t tell you the
number of times I’ve pulled an optical drive out of a system to replace it,
only to discover that I or my customer left an essential disc inside the
now-powerless drive. Luckily, most optical drives have a small hole in
the front, usually just below the drive opening, into which you can insert
a wire—an unbent paper clip is the standard tool for this purpose—and
push on an internal release lever that will eject the disc. Try it!
Burning Issues
The tremendous growth of the CD-R and CD-RW industry—and to a lesser
extent, the recordable DVD industry—has led to a substantial number of in-
compatibility issues between discs and drives. Some of these incompatibili-
ties trace back to serious IO (Ignorant Operator) problems; people try to
make these discs do jobs they aren’t designed to do. Even when people read
the manuals and jump through the proper hoops, real problems do arise,
many of which you can easily solve with a few checks.
Know What It Can Do
Most mistakes take place at the point of purchase,
when someone buys a drive without completely understanding its capabilities.
Don’t just assume that the device will do everything! Before I purchase a
CD-RW drive, for example, I make it a point to get my hands on every technical
document provided by the maker to verify exactly what capabilities the drive
possesses. I make sure that the drive has a good reputation—just use any
search engine and type in review and the model number of the drive to get
several people’s opinions.
Media Issues
The CD-R and CD-RW standards committees refused to
mandate the types of materials used in the construction of discs. As a result,
you see substantial quality differences among CD-R and CD-RW discs of
different brands and sources (they are made in several different countries).
As mentioned earlier, CD-R discs use organic inks as part of the burning
process. Fellow techs love to talk about which color to use or which color
gives the best results. Ignore them—the color itself means nothing. Instead,
try a few different brands of CD-R discs when you first get your drive to
determine what works best for you. If you have a particular reason for
burning CDs, such as music recording, you may want to ask for opinions
and recommendations among folks in online communities with the same
focus. They’re usually happy to share their hard-won knowledge about
what’s good.
In general, two items can affect media quality: speed and inks. Most
CD-R and CD-RW media makers certify their CDs to work up to a certain

speed multiplier. A media maker often has two product lines: a quality line
guaranteed to work at a certain speed, and a generic line where you take
your chances. As a rule, I buy both. I primarily use cheap discs, but I always
stash five to ten good quality discs in case I run into a problem. Again, this
will in large part depend on what you want them for—you may want to pull
out the cheapies for temporary backups, but stick with the high-end discs
for archiving musical performances.
All of the discussion above about CD-Rs and CD-RWs definitely holds
true for recordable DVD discs and drives as well. Factor in the incompatibil-
ity of standards and you’re looking at a fine mess. Do your homework be-
fore you buy or advise a client to buy a DVD-writable or -rewritable drive.
Buffer Underrun
Every CD and DVD burner comes with onboard RAM,
called buffer RAM—usually just called the buffer—that stores the incoming
data from the recording source. Buffer underrun , the inability of the source
device to keep the burner loaded with data, creates more coasters—that is,
improperly burned and therefore useless CDs and DVDs—than any other
single problem. Buffer underrun most often occurs when copying from
CD-ROM to CD-R/RW or from DVD-ROM to DVD-writable of all stripes.
Many factors contribute to buffer underrun, but two stand out as the most
important. The first factor is buffer size. Make sure you purchase drives
with large buffers, a minimum of 2 MB. Unlike with system RAM, you can’t
get a buffer upgrade. Second is multitasking. Most systems won’t enable
you to run any other programs while the burner is running.
One trick to reduce underrun is using an ISO. Unlike some CD and DVD
media drives, any hard drive can keep up with a CD or DVD burner. Doing a
bit-by-bit copy from disc to disc dramatically reduces the chance of a buffer
underrun adding to your coaster collection.
All current CD-RW and DVD burners include the BURN-Proof technol-
ogy developed by Sanyo, which has eliminated the underrun issue. These
drives can literally turn off the burning process if the buffer runs out of in-
formation and automatically restart as soon as the buffer refills. I love this
feature, as I can now burn CDs in the background and run other programs
without fear of underrun. If you’re buying a new CD-RW drive, make sure
you get one that uses the BURN-Proof technology.
Firmware Updates
Almost all optical drives come with an upgradeable flash ROM chip. If your
drive doesn’t read a particular type of media, or if any other non-intermit-
tent reading/writing problems develop, check the manufacturer’s Web site
to see if it offers a firmware upgrade. Almost every optical drive seems to
get one or two firmware updates during its production cycle.
Conclusion
The world of removable media continues to change at a pretty hectic pace.
Within the last couple of years, floppy drives have just about died out;
thumb drives have become the rewritable media of choice for most users;
high-definition optical drives and discs (HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc, see the
“Beyond A+” section) have hit the store shelves, although they’re both out-
rageously expensive as of this writing. Manufacturers keep inventing new
160
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

and exciting technologies that seem to appear out of nowhere. A CompTIA
A+ certified technician would be wise to keep removable media on his or
her radar, well after taking and passing the CompTIA A+ exams!
Beyond A+
Color Books
The term color books is often used in the world of CD-media. Books
are—well, books! In this case, they’re the standards developed in the indus-
try to describe various media. For example, the Red book describes the orig-
inal audio CD format. If you have a lot of money—say, US$3000—you may
purchase copies of these books, and yes, their covers really match the colors
of the standards. You might hear
a fellow computer support per-
son using these terms. Instead of
saying, “Does your CD-ROM
read CD-RWs?” they will say, “Is
that CD-ROM of yours Orange
book?” Technical specifications
also use these terms. I personally
don’t like the way many people
refer to these book colors, but the
terms are used enough that you
should memorize the meanings of
at least three book colors: Red,
Yellow, and Orange. Table 9.1
shows a complete list of CD-media
book colors.
High-Definition Optical Drives
At the time of this writing, two optical standards are duking it out to see
which will become the Next Great Thing™in optical media: HD DVD and
Blu-ray Disc. HD DVD (High-Density DVD) offered the initial salvo, com-
ing out with 30-GB optical discs that could contain 8 hours of High-Defini-
tion video. Sweet! Blu-ray (no special meaning aside from using blue lasers
rather than red lasers) responded with 50-GB discs, and the gloves were off.
Right now it appears that HD DVD will be the eventual winner on the video
front, but Blu-ray Disc might win on the data-storage front. Time will tell.

Chapter 9 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
floppy disk drives and optical-media technology.
Install Optical Drives
■
All optical drives use PATA or SATA connections
and support the ATAPI standard. PATA drives use
a regular 40-pin IDE connector; SATA drives use a
standard SATA connector. They are installed just
as if you were installing any ATA hard drive. After
installing a new optical drive, check My Computer
or Device Manager to confirm that Windows sees
the drive.
■
The Windows feature Auto Insert Notification (or
AutoPlay) causes Windows to automatically begin
an action when an optical disc is inserted in the
drive. In Windows 2000, if an audio CD is inserted,
track 1 plays automatically. If a data CD or DVD is
inserted, AutoPlay scans the root of the disc for the
AUTORUN.INF file and executes the commands in
that file. In Windows 2000, the only way to disable
AutoPlay was to manually edit the registry.
Windows XP can be configured by accessing the
AutoPlay tab in the drive’s Properties window.
■
An ISO file is a complete copy of an entire CD or
DVD disc. Windows 2000/XP can’t burn an ISO
back to disc, but third-party programs like Ahead
Nero Burning ROM or Roxio Easy Media Creator
can.
Troubleshoot Removable-Media Drives
■
No single component fails more often than a
floppy disk drive. If your floppy drive stops
working, try the following: check for a bad floppy
disk, check for disk data errors, check CMOS
settings, check the cables, and finally replace the
floppy drive.
■
A bad or incorrectly attached floppy data cable can
cause strange errors. The same directory may be
displayed even after swapping disks, or the LED
on the front of the drive may stay on. Check that
the red stripe on the cable is aligned with pin 1 on
the drive and the motherboard. If it is and the
drive still malfunctions, replace the cable.
■
If your optical drive doesn’t work, first check the
installation. Specifically, look at the master/slave
jumper settings, data cable, and power cable. If the
drive is seen by Windows but can’t read a
particular disc, try a commercial disc. It’s also
possible your drive doesn’t support your media
type; for example, your DVD-R drive may not be
able to read your DVD+RW disc. Clean the disc
with a soft damp cloth, wiping from the center
towards the edge. Never clean an optical disc in
the dishwasher!
■
If an optical disc becomes stuck in a drive, or if the
drive has no power and you need to eject the disc,
use a paper clip. Straighten the paper clip and look
for the small hole on the front of the drive. Insert
the paper clip in the hole and push the internal
release lever to eject the disc.
■
Not all media brands are created equally, and not
all drives play nicely with all brands of media.
Experiment and try different brands of media with
your drive until you find one that works reliably.
■
A buffer underrun is caused by the source device
failing to keep the recording device loaded with
data. Buffer underruns are the leading cause of
improperly burned, and therefore useless, CDs and
DVDs. Purchase a drive with a large buffer—at
least 2 MB. Some drives protect against buffer
underrun with a technology called BURN-Proof.
Purchase a BURN-Proof drive and your buffer
underruns will be eliminated.
■
Most optical drives come with an upgradeable
flash ROM chip. If your drive is suffering read/
write problems, check the manufacturer’s Web site
for a firmware upgrade.

Lab Projects
• Lab Project 9.1
If your lab PC has a floppy disk drive, install a
second floppy disk drive. How does your system
determine which is drive A: and which is drive B:?
Reverse the ribbon cable on the A: drive so the red
stripe no longer aligns with pin 1. What happens
when you boot the system back up? Can the drive
read disks in this condition?
• Lab Project 9.2
Adding a second optical drive to a PC enables you to
do some fun things, from making your own music
CDs to watching movies. Assuming you want to
install an ATAPI drive, you then need to face some
issues. Which controller should you use, primary or
secondary? Should both optical drives be on the
same controller or on different controllers? Why?
Most techs would install a burner as secondary
master and put a read-only drive on the primary
as slave, but different drives require different
considerations. If you don’t plan to copy CD to CD,
there’s no reason the read-only CD shouldn’t be
secondary slave. The key is you have to experiment.
Install a second optical drive—preferably a burner—
and run it through its paces. Copy files and burn
discs to and from the optical and hard drives. Then
change the configuration of your drives (such as
having both optical drives on the same controller)
and run through the testing process again. Do you
notice any differences?

henever I teach a class of new techs and we get to the section on
working with the command line, I’m invariably met with a chorus of
moans and a barrage of questions and statements. “Why do we need to learn
this old stuff?” “We’re running Windows XP Professional, not Windows 3.1!”
“Is this ritualistic hazing appropriate in an IT class?”
For techs who master the interface, the command line provides a powerful,
quick, and elegant tool for working on a PC. If you want to go beyond baby-tech
status, you’ll need to learn that interface and understand how to make it work.
You simply cannot work on all PCs without knowing the command line! It’s not
just me who thinks this way. The CompTIA A+ certification exams test you on a
variety of command-line commands for doing everything from renaming a file to
rebuilding a system file.

If you’re interested in moving beyond Windows and into other operat-
ing systems such as Linux, you’ll find that pretty much all of the serious
work is done at a command prompt. Even the Mac OS, for years a purely
graphical operating system, now supports a command prompt. Why is the
command prompt so popular? Well, for three reasons: First, if you know
what you’re doing, you can get most jobs done more quickly typing a text
command than clicking through a GUI. Second, a command-line interface
doesn’t take much operating system firepower, so it’s the natural choice for
jobs where you don’t need or don’t want (or can’t get to, in the case of Linux)
a full-blown GUI for your OS. Third, text commands take very little band-
width when sent across the network to another system.
So, are you sold on the idea of the command prompt? Good! This chap-
ter gives you a tour of the Windows command-line interface, explaining
how it works and what’s happening behind the scenes. You’ll learn the con-
cepts and master essential commands, and then you’ll work with files and
folders throughout your drives. The chapter wraps up with a brief section
on encryption and file compression in the “Beyond A+” section. A good tac-
tic for absorbing the material in this chapter is to try out each command or
bit of information as it is presented. If you have some experience working
with a command prompt, many of these commands should be familiar to
you. If the command line is completely new to you, please take the red pill
and join me as we step into the Matrix.
Operating systems existed long before PCs were invented. Ancient,
massive computers called mainframes and minicomputers employed sophisti-
cated operating systems. It wasn’t until the late 1970s that IBM went looking
for an OS for a new microcomputer—the official name for the PC—the com-
pany was developing, called the IBM Personal Computer, better known as
the PC. After being rebuffed by a company called Digital Research, IBM
went to a tiny company that had written a popular new version of the pro-
gramming language called BASIC. They asked the company president if he
could create an OS for the IBM PC. Although his company had never actu-
ally written an OS, he brazenly said, “Sure!” That man was Bill Gates, and
the tiny company was Microsoft.
After shaking hands with IBM representatives, Bill Gates hurriedly be-
gan to search for an OS based on the Intel 8086 processor. He found a primi-
tive OS called Quick-and-Dirty Operating System (QDOS), which was written
by a one-man shop, and he purchased it for a few thousand dollars. After
several minor changes, Microsoft released it as MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk
Operating System) version 1.1. Although primitive by today’s standards,
MS-DOS 1.1 could provide all the functions needed for an OS. Over the
years, MS-DOS went through version after version until the last Microsoft
version, MS-DOS 6.22, was released in 1994. Microsoft licensed MS-DOS to
PC makers so they could add their own changes and then rename the
program. IBM called its version PC-DOS.
DOS used a command-line interface. You typed a command at a
prompt, and DOS responded to that command. When Microsoft introduced
Windows 95 and Windows NT, many computer users and techs thought
that the DOS interface would go away, but it turned out that techs not only
Chapter 10: Working with the Command-Line Interface
167

continued to use the command line, they needed it to troubleshoot and fix
problems! With Windows 2000, it seemed once again that the command line
would die, but again, that just didn’t turn out to be the case.
Finally recognizing the importance of the command-line interface,
Microsoft beefed it up in Windows XP. The command line in Windows XP
offers commands and options for using various commands that go well be-
yond anything seen in previous Microsoft operating systems. This chapter
starts with some essential concepts of the command line and then turns to
more specific commands.

■Deciphering the Command-Line
Interface
So how does a command-line interface work? It’s a little like having an In-
stant Message conversation with your computer. The computer tells you it’s
ready to receive commands by displaying a specific set of characters called a
prompt .
Computer: Want to play a game?
Mike: _
You type a command and press ENTER to send it.
Mike: What kind of game?
Computer: _
The PC goes off and executes the command, and when it’s done it dis-
plays a new prompt, often along with some information about what it did.
Computer: A very fun game...
Mike: _
Once you get a new prompt, it means the computer is ready for your
next instruction. You give the computer commands in the graphical user in-
terface (GUI) of Windows as well, just in a different way, by clicking buttons
and menu options with your mouse instead of typing on the keyboard. The
results are basically the same: you tell the computer to do something and it
responds.
When you type in a command from the command line, you cause the
computer to respond. As an example, suppose you want to find out the con-
tents of a particular folder. From the command line, you’d type a command
(in this case DIR, but more on that in a minute), and the computer would re-
spond by displaying a screen like the one in Figure 10.1.
In the GUI, you would open My Computer and click the C: drive icon to
see the contents of that directory. The results might look like Figure 10.2,
which at first glance isn’t much like the command-line screen; however,
168
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
CompTIA sees mastering the
command line as an essential
skill for a CompTIA A+ certified
tech, but more so for IT Techni-
cian and Help Desk than for
Depot Tech.

simply by choosing a different view (Figure 10.3), you can make the results
look quite a bit like the command-line version, albeit much prettier
(Figure 10.4). The point here is that whichever interface you use, the
information available to you is essentially the same.
Accessing the Command Line
Before you can use the command-line interface, you’ve got to open it. You
can use various methods to do this, depending on the flavor of Windows

that you might be using. Some methods are simpler than others—just make
sure that you know at least one, or you’ll never get off the starting line!
One easy way to access the command-line interface is by using the Run
dialog box . Click the Start button, and then select Run. If you’re using Win-
dows 2000 or Windows XP, type CMD or COMMAND and press the ENTER
key (Figure 10.5). A window will pop up on your screen with a black back-
ground and white text—this is the command-line interface. Alternatively,
buried in the Start menu of most
computers, under Programs | Ac-
cessories, is a link to the command-
line interface. In Windows 2000
and XP, it’s called Command
Prompt. These links, just like the
Run dialog box, pull up a nice
command-line–interface window
(Figure 10.6). To close the win-
dow, you can either click the Close

Accessing the Command Line
This chapter will be much more fun if you follow along with your own
command line, so try this! Using one of the methods outlined in this sec-
tion, access a command prompt in Windows. Just remember that every-
thing you do at the prompt can affect the functioning of your PC. So

box, like on any other window, or simply type EXIT at any command
prompt and press ENTER.
The Command Prompt
The command prompt is always focused on a specific folder. This is impor-
tant because any commands you issue are performed on the files in the folder
on which the prompt is focused. For example, if you see a prompt that looks
like the line below you know that the focus is on the root directory of the C:
drive:
C:\>
If you see a prompt that looks like Figure 10.7, you know that the focus is
on the C:\Diploma\APLUS\ folder of the C: drive. The trick to using a com-
mand line is first to focus the prompt on the drive and folder where you
want to work.
Filenames and File Formats
Windows manifests each program and piece of data as an individual file.
Each file has a name, which is stored with the file on the drive. Windows in-
herits the idea of files from older operating systems⎯namely DOS⎯so a
quick review of the old-style DOS filenames helps in understanding how
Windows filenames work. Names are broken down into two parts: the file-
name and the extension. In true DOS, the filename could be no longer than
eight characters, so you’ll often see oddly named files on older systems. The
extension, which is optional, could be up to three characters long in true
DOS, and most computer programs and users continue to honor that old
limit, even though it does not apply to modern PCs. No spaces or other ille-
gal characters (/ \ [ ] | ÷ + = ; , * ?) could be used in the filename or exten-
sion. The filename and extension are separated by a period, or dot. This
naming system was known as the 8.3 (eight-dot-three) naming system .
Here are some examples of acceptable true DOS filenames:
FRED.EXE
SYSTEM.INI
FILE1.DOC
DRIVER3.SYS
JANET
CODE33.H
Here are some unacceptable true DOS filenames:
4CHAREXT.EXEC
WAYTOOLONG.FIL
BAD÷CHAR.BAT
.NO
I mention the true DOS limitations for a simple reason: backward compati-
bility. All versions of Windows starting with 9x did not suffer from the 8.3

Tech Tip
Booting Directly to
a Prompt
Early versions of Windows (3.x,
9x—though not Me) enabled you
to boot directly to the command-
line interface, not loading the
GUI at all. Windows 2000 and
Windows XP do not have that op-
tion, as the graphical portion of
the OS is the OS. You can simu-
late the old user interface, if
you’re feeling brave, by altering
the way the shortcut to a com-
mand prompt works.
Go to Start | All Programs |
Accessories, and then right-click
the Command Prompt icon and
select Properties to open the Com-
mand Prompt Properties dialog
box. Select the Options tab, where
you’ll find four option boxes. The
one you want is Display Options.
By default, the Command Prompt
will display in a window. Click the
radio button for Full Screen, click
OK, and you’re good to go. The
next time you open the command-
line interface—from the shortcut
only—it’ll be full screen.
At about this time, a lot of
users who have been following
along are staring at a screen with
no buttons to click, and ESC
doesn’t do anything! No worries:
remember that you can type
EXIT and press ENTER to get out
of the command-line interface.
You can hold down the F5 or F8
key during boot up to access the
Windows 2000 or Windows XP
Advanced Options menu. This
has an option to boot to Safe
Mode with Command Prompt.
This loads the GUI into Safe Mode
and then overlays that with a
command-line interface for rapid
access to a prompt. This saves
you the step of going to Start |
Run and typing CMD. This is
not the old-style command-
prompt–only interface!

filename limitation, instead supporting filenames of up to 255 characters
(but still using the three-character extension) using a trick called long file-
names (LFN). Windows systems using LFN retained complete backward
compatibility by automatically creating two names for every file, an 8.3 file-
name and a long filename. Modern Windows using NTFS works almost
exactly the same way as LFNs.
Whether you’re running an ancient DOS system or the latest version of
Windows Vista, the extension is very important, because the extension part
of the filename tells the computer the type or function of the file. Program
files use the extension .EXE (for executable) or .COM (for command). Any-
thing that is not a program is some form of data to support a program. Dif-
ferent programs use different types of data files. The extension usually
indicates which program uses that particular data file. For example,
Microsoft Word uses the extension .DOC, while WordPerfect uses .WPD,
and PowerPoint uses .PPT. Graphics file extensions, in contrast, often reflect
the graphics standard used to render the image, such as .GIF for
CompuServe’s Graphics Interchange Format or .JPG for the JPEG (Joint
Photographic Experts Group) format.
Changing the extension of a data file does not affect its
contents, but without the proper extension, Windows won’t
know which program uses it. You can see this clearly in My
Computer. Figure 10.8 shows a folder with two identical
image files. The one on top shows the Photoshop icon,
which is the program that Windows will use to open that
file; the one on the bottom shows a generic icon, because I
deleted the extension. Windows GUI doesn’t show file ex-
tensions by default. Figure 10.9 shows the contents of that
same folder from the command line.
All files are stored on the hard drive in binary format,
but every program has its own way of reading and writing
this binary data. Each unique method of binary organiza-
tion is called a file format. One program cannot read another
program’s files unless it has the ability to convert the other
program’s format into its format. In the early days of DOS,
no programs were capable of performing this type of con-
version, yet people wanted to exchange files. They wanted
some type of common format that any program could read.
The answer was a special format called American Stan-
dard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) .
The ASCII standard defines 256, eight-bit characters.
These characters include all the letters of the alphabet
(uppercase and lowercase), numbers, punctuation,
many foreign characters (such as accented letters for
French
and
Spanish—é,
ñ,
ô—and
other
typical
non-English characters), box-drawing characters, and a
series of special characters for commands such as a car-
riage return, bell, and end of file (Figure 10.10). ASCII
files, more commonly known as text files, store all data in
ASCII format. The ASCII standard, however, is for more

than just files. For example, the keyboard
sends the letters of keys you press, in
ASCII code, to the PC. Even the monitor
outputs in ASCII when you are running
DOS.
ASCII was the first universal file for-
mat. Virtually every type of program—
word processors, spreadsheets, data-
bases, presentation programs—can read
and write text files. However, text files
have severe limitations. A text file can’t
store important information such as
shapes, colors, margins, or text attrib-
utes (bold, underline, font, and so on).
Therefore, even though text files are
fairly universal, they are also limited to
the 256 ASCII characters.
Even in the most basic text, you need
to perform a number of actions beyond
just printing simple characters. For ex-
ample, how does the program reading
the text file know when to start a new line? This is where the first 32 ASCII
characters come into play. These first 32 characters are special commands
(actually, some of them are both commands and characters). For example,
the ASCII value 7 can be either a large dot or a command to play a note (bell)
on the PC speaker. ASCII value 9 is a Tab. ASCII value 27 is an Escape.
ASCII worked well for years, but as computers became used worldwide,
the industry began to run into a problem⎯there’s a lot more than 256 char-
acters used all over the world! Nobody could use Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, or
even Braille! In 1991, the Unicode
Consortium,
an
international
standards
group,
introduced
Unicode. Basic Unicode is a 16-bit
code that covers every character
for the most common languages
plus a few thousand symbols.
With Unicode you can make just
about any character or symbol
you might imagine⎯plus a few
thousand more you’d never even
think of. The first 256 Unicode
characters are exactly the same as
ASCII characters, making for easy
backward compatibility.

A lot of e-mail programs can use Unicode characters, as can Internet
message boards such as my Tech Forums. You can use Unicode charac-
ters to accent your writing or simply to spell a person’s name cor-
rectly—Martin Acuña—when you address him. Working with Unicode
is fun, so try this!

Open a text editing program, such as Notepad in the
Windows GUI.
2.
Hold down the ALT key on your keyboard, and, referring to
Figure 10.10, press numbers on your keyboard’s number pad to

display an ñ, whereas ALT-168 will show a ¿.

focus the prompt at the specific drive and folder that contains the files or
programs with which you want to work. This can be a little more compli-
cated than it seems, especially in Windows 2000 and Windows XP.
At boot, Windows assigns a drive letter (or name) to each hard drive
partition and to each floppy or other disk drive. The first floppy drive is
called A:, and the second, if installed, is called B:. Hard drives usually start
with the letter C: and can continue to Z: if necessary. CD-media drives by
default get the next available drive letter after the last hard drive. Windows
2000 and XP enable you to change the default lettering for drives, so you’re
likely to see all sorts of lettering schemes. On top of that, Windows 2000 and
XP let you mount a hard drive as a volume in another drive.
Whatever the names of the drives, Windows uses a hierarchical direc-
tory tree to organize the contents of these drives. All files are put into groups
Windows calls folders, although you’ll often hear techs use the term directory
rather than folder, a holdover from the true DOS days. Any file not in a folder
within the tree—that is, any file in the folder at the root of the directory
tree—is said to be in the root directory . A folder inside another folder is
called a subfolder. Any folder can have multiple subfolders. Two or more
files with the same name can exist in different folders on a PC, but two files
in the same folder cannot have the same name. In the same way, no two
subfolders under the same folder can have the same name, but two
subfolders under different folders can have the same name.
When describing a drive, you use its letter and a colon. For example, the
hard drive would be represented by C:. To describe the root directory, put a
backslash (\) after the C:, as in C:\. To describe a particular directory, add the
name of the directory. For example, if a PC had a directory in the root directory
called TEST, it would be C:\TEST. Subdirectories in a directory are displayed
by adding backslashes and names. If the TEST directory had a subdirectory
called SYSTEM, it would be shown like this: C:\TEST\SYSTEM. This naming
convention provides for a complete description of the location and name of any
file. If the C:\TEST\SYSTEM directory included a file called TEST2.TXT, it
would be C:\TEST\SYSTEM\TEST2.TXT.
The exact location of a file is called its path . The path for the TEST2.TXT
file is C:\TEST\SYSTEM. Here are some examples of possible paths:
C:\PROGRAM FILES
C:\WINNT\system32\1025
F:\FRUSCH3\CLEAR
A:\REPORTS
D:\
Here are a few items to remember about folder names and filenames.

Folders and files may have spaces in their names.

The only disallowed characters are the following eleven: * “ / \ [ ] : ;

used.

Tech Tip
Directory Trees
It helps to visualize a directory
tree as upside down, because in
geek-speak, the trunk, or root di-
rectory, is spoken of as if it were
“above” the folders that divide it,
and those subfolders “below” root
are spoken of as being “above” the
other subfolders inside them. For
example, “The file is in the Adobe
folder under Program Files.”

■Mastering Fundamental
Commands
It’s time to try using the command line, but before you begin, a note of warn-
ing is in order: the command-line interface is picky and unforgiving. It will
do what you say, not what you mean, so it always pays to double-check that
those are one and the same before you press ENTER and commit the com-
mand. One careless keystroke can result in the loss of crucial data, with no
warning and no going back. In this section, you’ll explore the structure of
commands and then play with four commands built into all versions of
Microsoft’s command-line interface: DIR, CD, MD, and RD.
Structure: Syntax and Switches
All commands in the Windows command-line interface use a similar struc-
ture and execute in the same way. You type the name of the command fol-
lowed by the target of that command and any modifications of that
command that you want to apply. You can call up a modification by using
an extra letter or number, called a switch or option, which may follow either
the command or the target, depending on the command. The proper way to
write a command is called its syntax . The key with commands is that you
can’t spell anything incorrectly or use a \ when the syntax calls for a /. The
command line is completely inflexible, so you have to learn the correct
syntax for each command.
[command] [target (if any)] [switches]
or
[command] [switches] [target (if any)]
How do you know what switches are allowed? How do you know
whether the switches come before or after the target? If you want to find out
the syntax and switches used by a particular command, always type the
command followed by a /? to get help.
DIR Command
The
DIR command
shows you the contents of the directory where the
prompt is focused. DIR is used more often than any other command at the
command prompt. When you open a command-line window in Windows
XP, it opens focused on your user folder. You will know this because the
prompt will look like this: C:\Documents and Settings\username>.
By typing in DIR and then pressing the ENTER key (remember that you must
always press ENTER to execute a command from the command line), you will
see something like Figure 10.11.
If you are following along on a PC, remember that different computers con-
tain different files and programs, so you will absolutely see something different
from what’s shown in Figure 10.11! If a lot of text scrolls quickly down the
screen, try typing DIR /P (pause). Don’t forget to press ENTER. The DIR /P com-
mand is a lifesaver when you’re looking for something in a large directory.
Chapter 10: Working with the Command-Line Interface
175
Tech Tip
Do You Need Spaces?
Some commands give you the
same result whether you include
spaces or not. DIR/P and DIR /P,
for example, provide the same
output. Some commands, how-
ever, require spaces between the
command and switches. In gen-
eral, get into the habit of putting
spaces between your command
and switches and you won’t run
into problems.

When you type a simple DIR command, you will see that some of the en-
tries look like this:
09/04/2008   05:51 PM          63,664 bambi.jpg
All of these entries are files. The DIR command lists the creation date,
creation time, file size in bytes, filename, and extension. Any entries that
look like this are folders:
12/31/2004  10:18 AM    <DIR>          WINDOWS
The DIR command lists the creation date, creation time, <DIR> to tell
you it is a folder, and the folder name. If you ever see a listing with
<JUNCTION> instead of <DIR>, you’re looking at a hard drive partition
that’s been mounted as a folder instead of a drive letter:
08/06/2006  02:28 PM    <JUNCTION>     Other Drive
Now type the DIR /W com-
mand. Note that the DIR /W com-
mand shows only the filenames, but
they are arranged in five columns
across your screen. Finally, type
DIR /? to see the screen shown in
Figure 10.12, which lists all possible
switches for the command.
Typing any command followed
by a /? brings up a help screen for
that particular command. Although
these help screens can sometimes
seem a little cryptic, they’re useful
when you’re not too familiar with a
command or you can’t figure out
how to get a command to do what
you need. Even though I have al-
most every command memorized,

• Figure 10.11
DIR in a user’s folder
Extra text typed after a com-
mand to modify its operation,
such as the /W or /P after DIR,
is called a switch. Almost all
switches can be used simulta-
neously to modify a command.
For example, try typing
DIR /W /P.
• Figure 10.12

lists all possible switches for DIR command

I still refer to these help screens—you should use them as well. If you’re re-
ally lost, type HELP at the command prompt for a list of commands you
may type. Once you find one, type HELP and then the name of the com-
mand. For example, if you type HELP DIR, you’ll see the screen shown in
Figure 10.12.
Directories: The CD Command
The CD (or CHDIR) command enables you to change the focus of the com-
mand prompt to a different directory. To use the CD command, type CD\
followed by the name of the directory on which you want the prompt to fo-
cus. For example, to go to the C:\OBIWAN directory, you would type
CD\OBIWAN, and then press ENTER. If the system has an OBIWAN direc-
tory, the prompt will change focus to that directory, and appear as
C:\OBIWAN>. If no OBIWAN directory exists or if you accidentally typed
something like OBIWAM, you get the error “The system cannot find the
path specified.” If only I had a dollar for every time I’ve seen those errors! I
usually get them due to typing too fast. If you get this error, check what you
typed and try again.
To return to the root directory, type CD\ and press ENTER. You can use
the CD command to point DOS to any directory. For example, you could
type CD\FRED\BACKUP\TEST from a C:\ prompt, and the prompt
would change to C:\FRED\BACKUP\TEST\>—assuming, of course, that
your system has a directory called C:\FRED\BACKUP\TEST.
Once the prompt has changed, type DIR again. You should see a differ-
ent list of files and directories. Every directory holds different files and sub-
directories, so when you point DOS to different directories, the DIR
command will shows you different contents.
The CD command allows you to use a space instead of a backslash, a con-
venient shortcut. For example, you could go to the C:\WINDOWS directory
from the root directory simply by typing CD WINDOWS at the C:\ prompt.
You can use the CD [space] command to move one level at a time, like this:
C:\>CD FRED
C:\FRED\>CD BACKUP
C:\FRED\BACKUP>CD TEST
Or, you can jump multiple directory levels in one step, like this:
C:\>CD FRED\BACKUP\TEST
C:\FRED\BACKUP\TEST>
A final trick: if you want to go up a single directory level, you can type
CD followed immediately by two periods. So, for example, if you’re in the
C:\FRED\BACKUP directory and you want to move up to the C:\FRED di-
rectory, you can simply type CD.. and you’ll be there:
C:\FRED\BACKUP>CD..
C:\FRED>
Take some time to move the DOS focus around the directories of your
PC using the CD and DIR commands. Use DIR to find a directory, and then
use CD to move the focus to that directory. Remember, CD\ will always get
you back to the root directory.

Tech Tip
Errors Are Good!
Consider errors in general for a
moment—not just command
prompt errors like “Invalid direc-
tory,” but any error, including
Windows errors. Many new com-
puter users freeze in horror when
they see an error message. Do not
fear error messages. Error mes-
sages are good! Love them. Wor-
ship them. They will save you.
Seriously, think how confusing
it would be if the computer didn’t
tell you when you messed up! Er-
ror messages tell you what you
did wrong so you can fix it. You
absolutely cannot hurt your PC
in any way by typing the DIR or
CD command incorrectly. Take
advantage of this knowledge and
experiment. Intentionally make
mistakes to familiarize yourself
with the error messages. Have
fun and learn from errors!

Moving Between Drives
The CD command is not used to move between drives. To get the prompt to
point to another drive (“point” is command line geek-speak for “switch its
focus”), just type the drive letter and a colon. If the prompt points at the
C:\Sierra directory and you want to see what is on the floppy (A:) drive, just
type A: and DOS will point to the floppy drive. You’ll see the following on
the screen:
C:\Sierra>A:
A:\>
To return to the C: drive, just type C: and you’ll see the following:
A:\>C:
C:\Sierra>
Note that you return to the same directory you left. Just for fun, try typ-
ing in a drive letter that you know doesn’t exist. I know that my system does
not have a W: drive. If I type in a nonexistent drive on a Windows system, I
get the following error:
The system cannot find the drive specified.
Try inserting a floppy disk and using the CD command to point at its
drive. Do the same with a CD-media disc. Type DIR to see the contents of
the floppy or CD-media. Type CD to move the focus to any folders on the
floppy or CD-media. Now return focus to the C: drive.
Using the DIR, CD, and drive letter commands, you can access any
folder on any storage device on your system. Make sure you can use these
commands comfortably to navigate inside your computer.
Making Directories
Now that you have learned how to navigate in a command-prompt world,
it’s time to start making stuff, beginning with a new directory.
To make a directory, use the MD (or MKDIR) command . To create a direc-
tory called STEAM under the root directory C:, for example, first ensure that
you are in the root directory by typing CD\. You should see the prompt.
C:\>
Now that the prompt points to the root directory, type the following:
C:\>MD STEAM
Once you press ENTER, Windows will execute the command, but it won’t
volunteer any information about what it did. You must use the DIR com-
mand to see that you have, in fact, created a new directory. Note that the
STEAM directory in this example is not listed last, as you might expect.

What about uppercase and lowercase? Windows will support both but it
always interprets all commands as uppercase. Use the MD command to
make a folder called steam (note the lowercase) and see what happens. This
also happens in the graphical Windows. Go to your desktop and try to
make two folders, one called STEAM and the other called steam, and see
what Windows tells you.
To create a FILES subdirectory in the STEAM directory, first use the
CD\ command to point the prompt at the STEAM directory:
CD\STEAM
Then run the MD command to make the FILES directory:
MD FILES
Make sure that the prompt points to the directory in which you want to
make the new subdirectory before you execute the MD command. When
you’re done, type DIR to see the new FILES subdirectory. Just for fun, try
the process again and add a GAMES directory under the STEAM directory.
Type DIR to verify success.
Removing Directories
Removing subdirectories works exactly like making them. First, get to the
directory that contains the subdirectory you want to delete, and then exe-
cute the RD (or RMDIR) command . In this example, delete the FILES subdi-
rectory in the C:\STEAM directory. First, get to where the FILES directory is
located—C:\STEAM—by typing CD\STEAM. Then type RD FILES. If no
response was received from Windows, you probably did it right! Type DIR
to check that the FILES subdirectory is gone.
The plain RD command will not delete a directory in Windows if the di-
rectory contains files or subdirectories. If you want to delete a directory that
contains files or subdirectories, you must first empty that directory using
the DEL (for files) or RD (for subdirectories) command. You can use the RD
command followed by the /S switch to delete a directory as well as all files
and subdirectories. RD followed by the /S switch is handy but dangerous,
because it’s easy to delete more than you want. When deleting, always fol-
low the maxim “check twice and delete once.”
Now delete the STEAM and GAMES directories with RD followed by
the /S switch. Because the STEAM directory is in the root directory, point to
Chapter 10: Working with the Command-Line Interface

the root directory with CD\. Now execute the command RD C:\STEAM /S.
In a rare display of mercy, Windows will respond with the following:
C:\>rd steam /s
steam, Are you sure (Y/N)?
Press the Y key and both C:\STEAM and C:\STEAM\GAMES will be
eliminated.
Running a Program
To run a program from the command line, simply change the prompt focus
to the folder where the program is located, type the name of the program,
and then press the ENTER key on your keyboard. Try this safe example. Go to
the C:\WINNT\System32 or C:\WINDOWS\System32⎯the exact name of

Working with Directories
It’s important for a PC tech to be comfortable creating and deleting di-
rectories. To get some practice, try this:
1.
Create a new directory in the root directory using the make
directory command (MD). Type CD\ to return to the root
directory. At the command prompt, type the following:
C:\>MD JEDI
2.
As usual, the prompt tells you nothing—it just presents a fresh
prompt. Do a DIR (that is, type the DIR command) to see your
new directory. Windows will create the new directory wherever
it is pointing when you issue the command, whether or not
that’s where you meant to put it. To demonstrate, point the
prompt to your new directory using the CD command:
C:\>CD JEDI
3.
Now use the make directory command again to create a
directory called YODA:
C:\JEDI>MD YODA
Do a DIR again, and you should see that your JEDI directory
now contains a YODA directory.
4.
Type CD\ to return to the root directory so you can delete your
new directories using the remove directory command (RD):
C:\>RD /S JEDI
In another rare display of mercy, Windows responds with the
following:
jedi, Are you sure <Y/N>?
5.
Press Y to eliminate both C:\JEDI and C:\JEDI\YODA.

this folder varies by system. Type DIR/P to see the files
one page at a time. You should see a file called
MEM.EXE (Figure 10.13).
As mentioned earlier, all files with extensions .EXE
and .COM are programs, so MEM.EXE is a program. To
run the MEM.EXE program, just type the filename, in
this case MEM, and press ENTER (Figure 10.14). Note
that you do not have to type the .EXE extension, al-
though you can. Congratulations! You have just run
your first program from the command line!
■Working with Files
This section deals with basic file manipulation. You will learn how to look
at, copy, move, rename, and delete files. You’ll look at the ins and outs of
batch files. The examples in this section are based on a C: root directory with
the following files and directories:
C:\>dir
Volume in drive C has no label.
Volume Serial Number is 4C62-1572

Because you probably don’t have a PC with these files and directories,
follow the examples but use what’s on your drive. In other words, create
your own folders and copy files to them from various folders currently on
your system.
Attributes
All files have four special values, or attributes , which determine how pro-
grams (like My Computer) treat the file in special situations. The first attrib-
ute is the hidden attribute. If a file is hidden, it will not be displayed when
the DIR command is issued. Next is the read-only attribute . A read-only file
cannot be modified or deleted. Third is the system attribute, which is used
only for system files such as NTLDR and BOOT.INI. In reality, it does noth-
ing more than provide an easy identifier for these files. Fourth is the archive
attribute, which is used by backup software to identify files that have been
changed since their last backup.
ATTRIB.EXE is an external command-line program that enables you to
inspect and change file attributes. To inspect a file’s attributes, type the
ATTRIB command followed by the name of the file. To see the attributes of
the file AILog.txt, type ATTRIB AILOG.TXT. The result is
A      AILog.txt
The letter A stands for archive, the only attribute of AILog.txt.
Go to the C:\ directory and type ATTRIB by itself. You’ll see a result
similar to the following:
C:\>attrib
A          C:\AILog.txt
A          C:\aoedoppl.txt
A          C:\aoeWVlog.txt
A   H      C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
A  SH      C:\boot.ini
A   H      C:\CONFIG.SYS
A          C:\CtDrvStp.log
A  SH      C:\hiberfil.sys
A  SHR     C:\IO.SYS
182
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

A  SHR     C:\MSDOS.SYS
A  SHR     C:\NTDETECT.COM
A  SHR     C:\ntldr
A  SH      C:\pagefile.sys
A          C:\statusclient.log
A          C:\systemscandata.txt
A          C:\t3h0
The letter R means read-only, H is hidden, and S is system. Hey! There are
some new files there! That’s right, some were hidden. Don’t panic if you see
a number of files different from those just listed. No two C:\ directories are
ever the same. In most cases, you’ll see many more files than just these. No-
tice that important files, NTLDR and NTDETECT.COM, have the system,
hidden, and read-only attributes set. Microsoft does this to protect them
from accidental deletion.
The ATTRIB command is also used to change a file’s attributes. To add
an attribute to a file, type the attribute letter preceded by a plus sign (+) as an
option, and then type the filename. To delete an attribute, use a minus sign
(–). For example, to add the read-only attribute to the file AILog.txt, type
this:
ATTRIB +R AILOG.TXT
To remove the archive attribute, type this:
ATTRIB -A AILOG.TXT
Multiple attributes can be added or removed in one command. Here’s an
example of removing three attributes from the NTDETECT.COM file:
ATTRIB -R -S -H NTDETECT.COM
You can also automatically ap-
ply ATTRIB to matching files in
subdirectories by using the /s
switch at the end of the statement.
For example, if you had lots of
files in your My Music folder that
you wanted to hide, but they were
neatly organized in many subdi-
rectories, you could readily use
ATTRIB to change all of them with
a simple command. Change direc-
tories
from
the
prompt
until
you’re at the My Music folder and
then type the following:
ATTRIB +H *.MP3 /S
When you press the
ENTER
key, all your music files in My
Music and any My Music subdi-
rectories will become hidden files.

Try This!
Working with Attributes
It’s important for you to know that everything you do at the command
line affects the same files at the GUI level, so Try This!
1.
Go to My Computer and create a folder in the root directory of
your C: drive called TEST.
2.
Copy a couple of files into that folder and then right-click one to
see its properties.
3.
Open a command-line window and navigate to the C:\TEST
folder. Type DIR to see that the contents match what you see in
My Computer.
4.
From the command line, change the attributes of one or both
files. Make one a hidden file, for example, and the other
read-only.
5.
Now go back to My Computer and access the properties of each
file. Any changes?

Wildcards
Visualize having 273 files in one directory. A few of these files have the ex-
tension .DOC, but most do not. You are looking only for files with the .DOC
extension. Wouldn’t it be nice to type the DIR command so that only the
.DOC files come up? You can do this using wildcards.
A wildcard is one of two special characters, asterisk (*) and question mark
(?), that can be used in place of all or part of a filename, often to enable a com-
mand-line command to act on more than one file at a time. Wildcards work
with all command-line commands that take filenames. A great example is the
DIR command. When you execute a plain DIR command, it finds and displays
all the files and folders in the specified directory; however, you can also narrow
its search by adding a filename. For example, if you type the command DIR
AILOG.TXT while in your root (C:\) directory, you get the following result:
C:\>dir AILOG.TXT
Volume in drive C has no label.
Volume Serial Number is 4C62-1572
Directory of C:\
05/26/2006  11:37 PM                  0 AILog.txt
1 File(s)              0 bytes
0 Dir(s)  94,630,195,200 bytes free
If you just want to confirm the presence of a particular file in a particular
place, this is very convenient. But suppose you want to see all files with the
extension .TXT. In that case, you use the * wildcard, like this: DIR *.TXT.
A good way to think of the * wildcard is “I don’t care.” Replace the part of the
filename that you don’t care about with an asterisk (*). The result of DIR
*.TXT would look like this:
Volume in drive C has no label.
Volume Serial Number is 4C62-1572
Directory of C:\
05/26/2006  11:37 PM                 0 AILog.txt
05/29/2006  05:33 PM             5,776 aoedoppl.txt
05/29/2006  05:33 PM             2,238 aoeWVlog.txt
07/31/2005  10:40 PM               153 systemscandata.txt
4 File(s)          8,167 bytes
0 Dir(s)  94,630,002,688 bytes free
Wildcards also substitute for parts of filenames. This DIR command will
find every file that starts with the letter a:
C:\>dir a*.*
Volume in drive C has no label.
Volume Serial Number is 4C62-1572
Directory of C:\
05/26/2006  11:37 PM                 0 AILog.txt
05/29/2006  05:33 PM             5,776 aoedoppl.txt

So far you’ve seen how to use wildcards only with the DIR command,
but virtually every command that deals with files will take wildcards. Next,
I’ll show you the REN and DEL commands and how they use wildcards.
Renaming Files
To rename files, you use the REN (or RENAME) command , which seems
pretty straightforward. To rename the file IMG033.jpg to park.jpg, type this
and press the ENTER key:
ren img033.jpg park.jpg
“That’s great,” you might be thinking, “but what about using a more
complex and descriptive filename, like Sunny day in the park.jpg?” Type
what should work, like this:
ren img033.jpg Sunny day in the park.jpg
But you’ll get an error message
(Figure 10.15). Even the tried-and-
true method of seeking help by typ-
ing the command followed by /?
doesn’t give you the answer.
You can use more complicated
names by putting them in quotation
marks.
Figure
10.16
shows
the
same command that failed but now
succeeds because of the quotation
marks.
Deleting Files
To delete files, you use the
DEL
(or ERASE) command . DEL and
ERASE are identical commands
and can be used interchangeably.
Deleting files is simple—maybe too
simple. Windows’ users enjoy the
luxury of retrieving deleted files
from the Recycle Bin on those
“Oops, I didn’t mean to delete that”
occasions everyone encounters at
one time or another. The command
line,
however,
shows
no
such
mercy to the careless user. It has no
function equivalent to the Win-
dows Recycle Bin. Once a file has
been erased, it can be recovered
only by using a special recovery
utility such as Norton’s UNERASE.
Again, the rule here is to check twice
and delete once.
Chapter 10: Working with the Command-Line Interface
185
• Figure 10.15
Rename failed me.
• Figure 10.16
Success at last

To delete a single file, type the DEL command followed by the name of
the file to delete. To delete the file AILOG.TXT, for example, type this:
DEL AILOG.TXT
Although nothing will appear on the screen to confirm it, the file is now gone.
To confirm that the AILOG.TXT file is no longer listed, use the DIR command.
As with the DIR command, you can use wildcards with the DEL and
ERASE commands to delete multiple files. For example, to delete all files
with the extension .TXT in a directory, you would type this:
DEL *.TXT
To delete all files with the filename CONFIG in a directory, type DEL
CONFIG.*. To delete all the files in a directory, you can use the popular *.*
wildcard (often pronounced “star-dot-star”), like this:
DEL *.*
This is one of the few command-line commands that will elicit a response.
Upon receiving the DEL *.* command, Windows will respond with “Are
you sure? (Y/N),” to which you respond with a Y or N. Pressing Y will erase
every file in the directory, so be careful when using *.*!
Don’t confuse deleting files with deleting directories. DEL deletes files,
but it will not remove directories. Use RD to delete directories.
Copying and Moving Files
The ability to copy and move files in a command line is crucial to all techni-
cians. Due to its finicky nature and many options, the COPY command is
also rather painful to learn, especially if you’re used to dragging icons in
Windows. The following tried-and-true, five-step process will make it eas-
ier, but the real secret is to get in front of a C:\ prompt and just copy and
move files around until you’re comfortable. Keep in mind that the only dif-
ference between copying and moving is whether the original is left behind
(COPY) or not (MOVE). Once you’ve learned the COPY command , you’ve
learned the MOVE command !
Mike’s Five-Step COPY/MOVE Process
I’ve been teaching folks how to copy and move files for years using this
handy process. Keep in mind that hundreds of variations on this process ex-
ist. As you become more confident with these commands, try doing a COPY
/? or MOVE /? at any handy prompt to see the real power of these com-
mands. But first, follow this process step-by-step:
1.
Point the command prompt to the directory containing the files to be
copied or moved.
2.
Type COPY or MOVE and a space.
3.
Type the name(s) of the file(s) to be copied/moved (with or without
wildcards) and a space.
4.
Type the path of the new location for the files.
5.
Press ENTER.
186
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

Here’s an example. The directory C:\STEAM contains the file
README.TXT. Here’s how to copy this file to the floppy drive (A:).
1.
Type CD\STEAM to point command prompt to the STEAM
directory.
C:\>CD\STEAM
2.
Type COPY and a space.
C:\STEAM>COPY
3.
Type README.TXT and a space.
C:\STEAM>COPY README.TXT
4.
Type A:\.
C:\STEAM>COPY README.TXT A:\
5.
Press ENTER.
The entire command and response would look like this:
C:\STEAM>COPY README.TXT A:\
1 file(s) copied
If you point the command prompt to the A: drive and type DIR, the
README.TXT file will be visible. Here’s another example. Suppose 100 files
are in the C:\DOCS directory, 30 of which have the .DOC extension, and
suppose you want to move those files to the C:\STEAM directory. Follow
these steps:
1.
Type CD\DOCS to point the command prompt to the DOCS directory.
C:\>CD\DOCS
2.
Type MOVE and a space.
C:\DOCS>MOVE
3.
Type *.DOC and a space.
C:\DOCS>MOVE *.DOC
4.
Type C:\STEAM.
C:\DOCS>MOVE *.DOC C:\STEAM
5.
Press ENTER.
C:\DOCS>MOVE *.DOC C:\STEAM
30 file(s) copied
The power of the COPY/MOVE command makes it rather dangerous.
The COPY/MOVE command not only lets you put a file in a new location,
but it lets you change the name of the file at the same time. Suppose you
want to copy a file called AUTOEXEC.BAT from your C:\ folder to a floppy
disk, for example, but you want the name of the copy on the floppy disk to
be AUTO1.BAT. You can do both things with one COPY command, like this:
COPY C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT A:\AUTO1.BAT
Not only does the AUTOEXEC.BAT file get copied to the floppy disk, but
the copy also gets the new name AUTO1.BAT.
Chapter 10: Working with the Command-Line Interface
187

As another example, move all of the files with the extension .DOC from
the C:\DOCS directory to the C:\BACK directory and simultaneously
change the DOC extension to .SAV. Here is the command:
MOVE C:\DOCS\*.DOC C:\BACK\*.SAV
This says, “Move all files that have the extension .DOC from the directory
C:\DOCS into the directory C:\BACK, and while you’re at it, change their
file extensions to .SAV.” This is very handy, but very dangerous!
Say, for example, that I made one tiny typo. Here I typed a semicolon in-
stead of a colon after the second C:
MOVE C:\DOCS\*.DOC C;\BACK\*.SAV
The command line understands the semicolon to mean “end of command”
and therefore ignores both the semicolon and anything I type after it. As far
as the command line is concerned, I typed this:
MOVE C:\DOCS\*.DOC C
This, unfortunately for me, means “take all the files with the extension .DOC
in the directory C:\DOCS and copy them back into that same directory, but
squish them all together into a single file called C.” If I run this command,
Windows gives me only one clue that something went wrong:
MOVE C:\DOCS\*.DOC C
1 file(s) copied
See “1 file(s) copied”? Feeling the chilly hand of fate slide down my
spine, I do a DIR of the directory, and I now see a single file called C, where
there used to be 30 files with the extension .DOC. All of my DOC files are
gone, completely unrecoverable.
XCOPY
The standard COPY and MOVE commands can work only in one directory
at a time, making them a poor choice for copying or moving files in multiple
directories. To help with these multi-directory jobs, Microsoft added the
XCOPY command . (Note that there is no XMOVE, only XCOPY.)
XCOPY works similar to COPY, but XCOPY has extra switches that give
it the power to work with multiple directories. Here’s how it works. Say I
have a directory on my C: drive called \DATA. The \DATA directory has
three subdirectories: \JAN, \FEB, and \MAR. All of these directories, in-
cluding the \DATA directory, contain about 50 files. If I wanted to copy all
of these files to my D: drive in one command, I would use XCOPY in the
following manner:
XCOPY C:\DATA D:\DATA /S
Because XCOPY works on directories, you don’t have to use filenames as
you would in COPY, although XCOPY certainly accepts filenames and
wildcards. The /S switch, the most commonly used of all the many switches
that come with XCOPY, tells XCOPY to copy all subdirectories except for
empty ones. The /E switch tells XCOPY to copy empty subdirectories. When
you have a lot of copying to do over many directories, XCOPY is the tool to use.
188
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

Their power and utility make the DEL, COPY/MOVE, and XCOPY
commands indispensable for a PC technician, but that same power and util-
ity can cause disaster. Only a trained Jedi, with The Force as his ally…well,
wrong book, but the principle remains: Beware of the quick and easy key-
stroke, for it may spell your doom. Think twice and execute the command
once. The data you save may be yours!
Working with Batch Files
Batch files are nothing more than text files that store a series of commands,
one command per line. The only thing that differentiates a batch file from any
other text file is the .BAT extension. Take a look at Figure 10.17 and note the
unique icon used for a batch file compared to the icon for a regular text file.
You can create and edit batch files using any text editor program—good
old Notepad is often the tool of choice. This is the command-line chapter,
though, so it’s time to dust off the an-
cient but still important Edit pro-
gram—it comes with every version
of Windows—and use it to create
and edit batch files.
Edit
Get to a command prompt on any
Windows system and use the CD\
command to get to the root directory
(use C: to get to the C: drive if you’re
not on the C: drive by default). From
there, type EDIT at the command
prompt to see the Edit program’s
interface (Figure 10.18).
Now that you’ve started Edit,
type in the two commands as shown
in Figure 10.19. Make sure they look
exactly the same as the lines in
Figure 10.19.
Great! You have just made your
first batch file! All you need to do
now is save it with some name—the
name doesn’t matter, but this exam-
ple uses FIRST as the filename. It is
imperative, however, that you use
the extension .BAT. Even though you
could probably figure this out on
your own later, do it now. Hold
down the ALT key to activate the
menu. Press the F (File) key. Then
press S (Save). Type in the name
first.bat as shown in Figure 10.20.
Press ENTER and the file is now saved.

Now that you’ve saved the file,
exit the Edit program by pressing
ALT-F and then press X (Exit). You’re
back at the command prompt. Go
ahead and run the program by typ-
ing FIRST and pressing
ENTER.
Your results should look something
like Figure 10.21.
Super! The batch file created a
folder and moved the prompt to fo-
cus on that folder. Don’t run the
first batch file again or you’ll create
another folder inside the first one!
Now get back to the root direc-
tory of C: and edit the FIRST.BAT
file again. This time type EDIT
FIRST.BAT and press ENTER. The
batch file will come up, ready to
edit. Now change the batch file to look like Figure 10.22. Use the arrow keys
to move your cursor and the DELETE key to delete.
The VER command shows the current version of Windows. The ECHO
command tells the batch file to put text on the screen. Run the batch file, and
it should look like Figure 10.23.
Gee, that’s kind of ugly. Try editing the FIRST.BAT file one more time
and add the line
@echo off
as the first line of the batch file. Run FIRST.BAT again. It should look quite a
bit nicer! The echo off command tells the system not to show the command,
just the result.
Sometimes you just want to look at a batch file. The TYPE command dis-
plays the contents of a text file on the screen, as shown in Figure 10.24.

Don’t try using the TYPE
command on anything other
than a text file—the results will
be unpredictable.

One of the more irritating as-
pects to batch files is that sometimes
they don’t work unless you run
them in the folder in which they are
stored. This is due to the path set-
ting. Every time you open a com-
mand prompt, Windows loads a
number of settings by default. You
can see all of these settings by run-

Cross Check
Command Line versus GUI
Now that you’ve become familiar with the command-line interface, you
should be able to switch between the Windows GUI and the command
line with relative ease. Check to make sure you can explain how to do
the basic tasks covered in this chapter in both the Windows GUI and the
command line.
1.
How do you delete a folder in Windows?
2.
How do you delete a directory from the command line?
3.
Which interface is faster for which tasks?
4.
What advantage do wildcards give the command line over the
GUI when you’re working with files?

Windows where to look for a pro-
gram (or batch file) if you run a pro-
gram that’s not in your current folder.
For example, say I make a folder
called C:\batch to store all my batch
files. I can run the PATH command
from the command prompt to see my
current path (Figure 10.26).
I can then run the PATH com-
mand again, this time adding the
C:\batch folder (Figure 10.27). I can now place all my batch files in this
folder, and they will always work, no matter where I am in the system.

Beyond A+
Using Special Keys
You might find yourself repeatedly typing the same commands, or at least
very similar commands, when working at a prompt. Microsoft has provided
a number of ways to access previously typed commands. Type the DIR
command at a command prompt. When you get back to a prompt, press F1,
and the letter D will appear. Press F1 again. Now the letter I appears after
the D. Do you see what is happening? The F1 key brings back the previous
command one letter at a time. Pressing F3 brings back the entire command
at once. Now try running these three commands:
DIR /W
ATTRIB
MD FRED
Now press the up arrow key. Keep pressing it till you see your original
DIR command⎯it’s a history of all your old commands. Now use the right
arrow key to add /P to the end of your DIR command. Windows command
history is very handy.
Compact and Cipher
Windows XP offers two cool commands at the command-line interface:
COMPACT and CIPHER. COMPACT displays or alters the compression of
files on NTFS partitions. CIPHER displays or alters the encryption of folders
and files on NTFS partitions. If you type just the command with no added
parameters, COMPACT and CIPHER display the compression state and the
encryption state, respectively, of the current directory and any files it con-
tains. You may specify multiple directory names, and you may use
wildcards, as you learned earlier in the chapter. You must add parameters
to make the commands change things. For example, you add /C to com-
press and /U to uncompress directories and/or files with the COMPACT
command, and you add /E to encrypt and /D to decrypt directories and/or
files with the CIPHER command. When you do these operations, you also
mark the directories involved so that any files you add to them in the future
will take on their encryption or compression characteristics. In other words,
if you encrypt a directory and all its files, any files you add later will also be
encrypted. Same thing if you compress a directory. I’ll run through a quick
example of each.
COMPACT
First, try the COMPACT command. Figure 10.28 shows the result of enter-
ing the COMPACT command with no switches. It displays the compression
status of the contents of a directory called compact on a system’s D: drive.
Notice that after the file listing, COMPACT helpfully tells you that 0 files are
compressed and 6 files (all of them) are not compressed, with a total com-
pression ratio of 1.0 to 1.
Chapter 10: Working with the Command-Line Interface
193

If you enter the COMPACT
command with the /C switch, it
will compress all the files in the di-
rectory, as shown in Figure 10.29.
Look closely at the listing. Notice
that it includes the original and
compressed file sizes and calculates
the compression ratio for you. No-
tice also that the JPG (a compressed
graphics format) and WAV files
didn’t compress at all, while the
Word file and the BMP file (an un-
compressed graphics format) com-
pressed down to less than a third of
their
original
sizes.
Also,
can
you spot what’s different in the text
at
the
bottom
of
the
screen?
COMPACT claims to have com-
pressed seven files in two directo-
ries! How can this be? The secret is
that when it compresses all the files
in a directory, it must also compress
the directory file itself, which is
“in” the D: directory above it. Thus,
it correctly reports that it com-
pressed seven files: six in the com-
pact directory and one in the D:
directory.
Typing
COMPACT
again
shows you the directory listing, and
now there’s a C next to each file-
name, indicating that the file is
compressed (Figure 10.30).

• Figure 10.29
Typing COMPACT /C compresses the contents of the directory.
• Figure 10.30
The contents of D:\COMPACT have been compressed.

Okay, now suppose you want
to uncompress a file—the Dilbert
image, dilbert.bmp. To do this, you
must specify the decompression op-
eration, using the /U switch and the
name of the file you want decom-
pressed, as shown in Figure 10.31.
Note that COMPACT reports the
successful decompression of one
file only: dilbert.bmp. You could do
the same thing in reverse, using the
/C switch and a filename to com-
press an individual file.
CIPHER
The CIPHER command is a bit com-
plex, but in its most basic implemen-
tation, it’s pretty straightforward.
Figure 10.32 shows two steps in the process. Like the COMPACT command,
the CIPHER command simply displays the current state of affairs when en-
tered with no switches. In this case, it displays the encryption state of the files in
the D:\Work Files\Armor Pictures directory. Notice the letter U to the left of
the filenames, which tells you they are unencrypted. The second command you
can see on the screen in Figure 10.32 is this:
D:\Work Files\Armor Pictures>cipher /E /A
This time the CIPHER command carries two switches: /E specifies the
encryption operation, and /A says to apply it to the files in the directory, not
just the directory itself. As you can see, the command-line interface is actu-
ally pretty chatty in this case. It reports that it’s doing the encryption and
then tells you what it’s done, and it even warns you that you should clean
up any stray unencrypted bits that may have been left in the directory.
Chapter 10: Working with the Command-Line Interface
195
• Figure 10.31
Typing COMPACT /U DILBERT.BMP decompresses only that file.
• Figure 10.32
Typing CIPHER /E /A encrypts the contents of the directory.

To confirm the results of the cipher operation, enter the CIPHER com-
mand again, as shown in Figure 10.33. Note that the U to the left of each file-
name has been replaced with an E, indicating an encrypted file. The other
indication that this directory has been encrypted is the statement above the
file listing:
New files added to this directory will be encrypted.
Remember that the CIPHER
command works on directories
first and foremost, and it works
on individual files only when
you specifically tell it to do so.
That’s great, but suppose
you want to decrypt just one of
the files in the Armor Pictures
directory. Can you guess how
you need to alter the com-
mand? Simply add the file-
name of the file you want to
decrypt after the command and the relevant switches. Figure 10.34 shows
the CIPHER command being used to decipher DCP_0106.JPG, a single file.

Chapter 10 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
the command line.
Deciphering the Command-Line Interface
■
The text-based DOS-like user interface, now
known as the command-line interface, still
functions as a basic installation and troubleshooting
tool for techs in Windows 2000 and XP. Windows
comes with a text editor called EDIT that enables
technicians to manipulate text files from within the
command prompt.
■
When you use a command-line interface, the
computer tells you it’s ready to receive commands
by displaying a specific set of characters called a
prompt. You type a command and press ENTER to
send it. The OS goes off and executes the
command, and when it’s done it displays a new
prompt, often along with some information about
what it did. Once you get a new prompt, it means
the computer is ready for your next instruction.
■
You can access the command-line interface by
clicking Start | Run to open the Run dialog box,
and then typing CMD and pressing ENTER. You
can also click Start | Programs | Accessories |
Command Prompt in Windows 2000 and XP. To
close the command-line–interface window, either
click the Close box in the upper-right corner of the
window or type EXIT at the prompt and press
ENTER.
■
The command prompt is always focused on some
directory, and any commands you issue are
performed on the files in the directory on which the
prompt is focused. Make sure you focus the
prompt’s attention on the drive and directory in
which you want to work.
■
Windows manifests each program and piece of
data as an individual file. Each file has a name,
which is stored with the file on the drive. Names
are broken down into two parts: the filename and
the extension. In true DOS, the filename could
be no longer than eight characters. The extension,
which is optional, could be up to three
characters long. No spaces or other illegal
characters (/ \ [ ] | ÷ + = ; , * ?) could be used in
the filename or extension. The filename and
extension are separated by a period, or “dot.” This
naming system is known as the “eight-dot-three”
(8.3) naming system. All versions of Windows
starting with 9x allow filenames of up to 255
characters.
■
The filename extension tells the computer the type
or function of the file. Program files use the
extension .EXE (for executable) or .COM (for
command). If the file is data, the extension
indicates which program uses that particular data
file. Graphics files most often reflect the graphics
standard used to render the image, such as .GIF or
.JPG. Changing the file extension does not change
the data in the file. The Windows GUI doesn’t
show the file extensions by default.
■
All files are stored on the hard drive in binary
format, but every program has its own unique
method of binary organization, called a file format.
One program cannot read another program’s files
unless it has the ability to convert the other
program’s file format into its file format.
■
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange) was the first universal file format. The
ASCII standard defines 256, eight-bit characters,
including all the letters of the alphabet (uppercase
and lowercase), numbers, punctuation, many
foreign characters, box-drawing characters, and a
series of special characters for commands such as a
carriage return, bell, and end of file. ASCII files,
often called text files, store all data in ASCII
format. The keyboard sends the characters you
press on the keyboard in ASCII code to the PC.
Even the monitor outputs in ASCII when you are
running a command line.
■
As a rule, the OS treats the first 32 ASCII values as
commands. Some of them are both commands and
characters. How these first 32 values are treated
depends on the program that reads them.
■
Unicode supports thousands of 16-bit characters.
The first 256 Unicode characters are the same as the
complete 256 ASCII character set, which maintains
backward compatibility.
Chapter 10: Working with the Command-Line Interface
197

■
At boot, the OS assigns a drive letter to each hard
drive partition and to each floppy or other disk
drive. The first floppy drive is called A:, and the
second, if installed, is called B:. Hard drives start
with the letter C: and can continue to Z: if
necessary. CD-media drives usually get the next
available drive letter after the last hard drive.
■
Windows uses a hierarchical directory tree to
organize the contents of these drives. All files are
put into groups called directories. Windows also
uses directories, but it calls them folders. Any file
not in a directory within the tree, which is to say,
any file in the directory at the root of the directory
tree, is said to be in the root directory. Directories
inside directories are called subdirectories. Any
directory can have multiple subdirectories. Two or
more files or subdirectories with the same name
can exist in different directories on a PC, but two
files or subdirectories in the same directory cannot
have the same name.
■
When describing a drive, you use its assigned
letter, such as C: for the hard drive. To describe the
root directory, add a backslash (\), as in C:\. To
describe a particular directory, add the name of the
directory after the backslash. To add a subdirectory
after the directory, add another backslash and then
the subdirectory’s name. This naming convention
provides for a complete description of the location
and name of any file. The exact location of a file is
called its path.
Mastering Fundamental Commands
■
The command-line interface will do what you say,
not what you mean, so it always pays to double-
check that those are the same before you press
ENTER. One careless keystroke can result in the loss
of crucial data, with no warning and no going back.
■
The DIR command shows you the contents of the
directory on which the prompt is focused. The DIR
command lists the filename, extension, file size in
bytes, and creation date/time. The DIR /P command
pauses after displaying a screen’s worth of the
directory contents; press the SPACEBAR to display
the next screen. The DIR/W command shows you
filenames only, arranged in columns, with directory
names in square brackets.
■
Extra text typed after a command to modify its
operation, such as the /W or /P after DIR, is
called a switch. Almost all switches can be used
simultaneously to modify a command. Typing any
command followed by a /? brings up a help screen
for that particular command.
■
The CD command enables you to change the focus
of the command prompt to a different directory.
Type CD\ followed by the name of the directory
on which you want to focus the prompt, and press
ENTER. If no such directory exists or if you
mistyped the name, Windows will report: “The
system cannot find the path specified.” To return
to the root directory, type CD\ and press ENTER.
The CD command also allows you to use a space
instead of a backslash. The CD command is not
used to move between drives; to point the prompt
to another drive, type the drive letter and a colon.
■
To make a directory, use the MD (or MKDIR)
command. Once you press ENTER, the OS will
execute the command, but it won’t volunteer any
information about what it did. You must use the
DIR command to see that you have, in fact, created a
new directory. Make sure that the prompt points to
the directory in which you want to make the new
subdirectory before you execute the MD command.
■
To remove a directory, first point the prompt at the
directory that contains the subdirectory you want
to delete, and then execute the RD (or RMDIR)
command. If you get no response, you probably
did it right, but use the DIR command to be sure.
The RD command will not delete a directory if it
contains files or subdirectories; you must first
empty that directory using the DEL (for files) or
RD (for subdirectories) command. The RD
command followed by the /S switch will delete the
directory as well as all files and subdirectories.
Working with Files
■
All files have four special values, or attributes, that
determine how they will act in special situations:
hidden, read-only, system, and archive. These
attributes can be set through software. If a file is
hidden, it will not be displayed when the DIR
command is performed. A read-only file cannot be
modified or deleted. The system attribute, which is
used only for system files such as NTLDR and
NTDETECT.COM, provides an easy identifier for
these files. The archive attribute is used by backup
software to identify files that have been changed
since their last backup.
198
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

■
ATTRIB.EXE is an external program that enables
you to inspect and change file attributes. Type the
ATTRIB command followed by the name of the
file and press ENTER. In the resulting list of files,
letter codes indicate each file’s attributes, if any: A
stands for archive, R means read-only, H is hidden,
and S is system. The ATTRIB command can change
a file’s attributes. To add an attribute to a file, type
the attribute letter preceded by a plus sign (+), and
then the filename. To delete an attribute, use a
minus sign (–). Multiple attributes can be added or
removed in one command.
■
Wildcards are two special characters, asterisk (*)
and question mark (?), that can be used in place of
all or part of a filename to make a command act on
more than one file at a time. Wildcards work with
all command-line commands that take filenames.
The asterisk (*) wildcard replaces any part of a
filename, before and/or after the period. The ?
wildcard replaces any single character. Virtually
every command that deals with files will take
wildcards.
■
Use the REN (or RENAME) command to rename
files and folders. If the new name contains spaces,
enclose it in quotation marks.
■
To delete files, you use the DEL or ERASE command.
DEL and ERASE are identical commands and can be
used interchangeably. DEL will not erase directories.
To delete a single file, type the DEL command
followed by the name of the file. No confirmation will
appear on the screen. To delete all the files in a
directory, you can use the *.* (star-dot-star) wildcard.
Upon receiving the DEL *.* command, Windows will
respond with “Are you sure? (Y/N),” to which you
respond with a Y or N. Pressing Y will erase every file
in the directory. It pays to check twice before you
delete, because the command line has no function
equivalent to the Windows Recycle Bin that allows
you to retrieve an accidentally deleted file; once a file
has been erased, it can be recovered only by using a
special recovery utility.
■
The COPY and MOVE commands are used to copy
and move files. The only difference between them
is whether the original is left behind (COPY) or not
(MOVE). Type COPY or MOVE and a space. Point
the prompt to the directory containing the files to
be copied or moved. Type the name(s) of the file(s)
to be copied/moved (with or without wildcards)
and a space. Type the path of the new location for
the files. Press ENTER. The COPY/MOVE
command not only lets you put a file in a new
location, but it also lets you change the name of the
file at the same time.
■
Check for the common typo of substituting a
semicolon for a colon, because the semicolon
means “end of command” and therefore ignores
both the semicolon and anything you type after it.
■
XCOPY works similarly to COPY but has extra
switches that give XCOPY the power to work with
multiple directories. Because XCOPY works on
directories, you don’t have to use filenames as you
would in COPY, although you can use filenames
and wildcards. The /S switch tells XCOPY to copy
all subdirectories except for empty ones. The /E
switch tells it to copy empty subdirectories.
■
Batch files are text files that contain a series of
commands with one command per line. Batch files
must end with the .BAT file extension. You can use
the Edit program within the command line to
create batch files or a text editor from the Windows
GUI such as Notepad.
■
The TYPE command displays the contents of a file
on the screen. Don’t use TYPE on binary files as the
results are unpredictable.
■
Every time you open a command prompt, Windows
loads a number of settings by default. You can see
all of these settings by running the SET command.
■
When you type a command, Windows will try to
run it as an internal command, like CD or DIR. If
what you typed is not an internal command, such
as EDIT or ATTRIB, Windows will check the folder
that currently has the command-prompt focus. If
the command is not found there, Windows will
check all folders in the path for the command.
■
Storing batch files in a folder included in
Windows’ path will ensure your batch files will
run no matter where your command prompt is
focused. Use the PATH command to see the
current path. To add a folder to the Windows’
path, type PATH followed by that folder.

t’s a fine line in the Windows world between installation, maintenance, and
troubleshooting. Most troubleshooting is nothing more than a completion of
the installation of a new piece of hardware or software that either failed or was
not properly maintained. In the Essentials text you saw how to install and
maintain Windows—along with a bit of very basic troubleshooting. This
chapter picks up where the Essentials text left off, concentrating on the type of
troubleshooting you need for a machine that was working properly earlier but
suddenly stopped (rather than cases of incomplete installation or configuration,
although there are a few exceptions).

■Troubleshooting Windows
By now you should be familiar with the essential tools for troubleshooting
and repairing Windows. You know about Disk Management, Device Man-
ager, Event Viewer, and more. You’ve spent countless hours preparing sys-
tems for disaster with NTBackup and System Restore. While learning about
the tools, you also learned how to use them. This section puts it all together
and shows you a plan to deal with potential disasters for a Windows
computer.
This section looks at Windows problems from the ground up. It starts
with catastrophic failure—a PC that won’t boot—and then discusses ways to
get past that problem. The next section covers the causes and work-arounds
when the Windows GUI fails to load. Once you can access the GUI, then the
204

world of Windows diagnostic and troubleshooting tools that you’ve spent so
much time learning about comes to your fingertips. First, however, you have
to get there.
Failure to Boot
Windows boot errors take place in those short moments between the time
the POST ends and the Loading Windows screen begins. For Windows to
start loading the main operating system, the critical system files NTLDR ,
NTDETECT.COM , and BOOT.INI must reside in the root directory of the C:
drive, and BOOT.INI must point to the Windows boot files. If any of these
requirements isn’t in place, the system won’t get past this step. Here are
some of the common errors you see at this point:
No Boot Device Present
NTLDR Bad or Missing
Invalid BOOT.INI
Note that these text errors take place very early in the startup process.
That’s your big clue that you have a boot issue. If you get to the Windows
splash screen and then lock up, that’s a whole different game, so know the
difference.
If you get one of the catastrophic error messages, you have a three-level
process to get back up and running. You first should attempt to repair. If
that fails, then attempt to restore from a backup copy of Windows. If restore
is either not available or fails, then your only recourse is to rebuild. You will
lose data at the restore and rebuild phases, so you definitely want to spend a
lot of effort on the repair effort first!
Attempt to Repair Using Recovery Console
To begin troubleshooting one of these errors, boot from the installation
CD-ROM and have Windows do a repair of an existing installation. Win-
dows will prompt you if you want to use the Recovery Console (a text-based
startup of Windows that gets you to a command prompt similar to the Win-
dows command prompt) or the emergency repair process (ASR/ERD). Start
with the Recovery Console.
If you followed the instructions earlier in the lesson, then you’ve in-
stalled the Recovery Console onto your system and have it as an option
when you boot the system. If not, start it as described earlier using the Win-
dows 2000 or XP installation CD-ROM. When you select the Recovery Con-
sole, you will see a message about NTDETECT, another one that the
Recovery Console is starting up, and then you will be greeted with the fol-
lowing message and command prompt:
Microsoft Windows XP<TM> Recovery Console.
The Recovery Console provides system repair and recovery functionality.
Type Exit to quit the Recovery Console and restart the computer.
1: C:\WINDOWS
Which Windows XP installation would you like to log onto
<To cancel, press ENTER>?
Chapter 11: Windows Troubleshooting
205

The cursor is a small, white rectangle sitting to the right of the question
mark on the last line. If you are not accustomed to working at the command
prompt, this may be disorienting. If there is only one installation of Win-
dows XP on your computer, type the number 1 at the prompt and press the
ENTER key. If you press ENTER before typing in a valid selection, the Recov-
ery Console will cancel and the computer will reboot. The only choice you
can make in this example is 1. Having made that choice, the only change to
the screen above is a new line:
Type the Administrator password:
This is also followed by the cursor. Enter the Administrator password
for that computer and press ENTER. The password will not display on the
screen; you will see asterisks in place of the password. The screen still shows
everything that has happened so far, unless something has happened to
cause an error message. It now looks like this:
Microsoft Windows XP<TM> Recovery Console.
The Recovery Console provides system repair and recovery functionality.
Type Exit to quit the Recovery Console and restart the computer.
1: C:\WINDOWS
Which Windows XP installation would you like to log onto
<To cancel, press ENTER>? 1
Type the Administrator password: ********
C:\Windows>
By now, you’ve caught on and know that there is a rectangular prompt
immediately after the last line. Now what do you do? Use the Recovery
Console commands, of course. Recovery Console uses many of the com-
mands that worked in the Windows command-line interface that you ex-
plored in Chapter 10, as well as some uniquely its own. Table 11.1 lists the
common Recovery Console commands.
The Recovery Console shines in the business of manually restoring reg-
istries, stopping problem services, rebuilding partitions (other than the sys-
tem partition), and using the
EXPAND
command to extract copies of
corrupted files from a CD-ROM or floppy disk.
Using the Recovery Console, you can reconfigure a service so that it
starts with different settings, format drives on the hard disk, read and write
on local FAT or NTFS volumes, and copy replacement files from a floppy or
CD-ROM. The Recovery Console enables you to access the file system, and
is still constrained by the file and folder security of NTFS, which makes it a
more secure tool to use than some third-party solutions.
The Recovery Console is best at fixing three items: repairing the MBR, re-
installing the boot files, and rebuilding BOOT.INI. Let’s look at each of these.
A bad boot sector usually shows up as a No Boot Device error. If it turns
out that this isn’t the problem, the Recovery Console command to fix it
won’t hurt anything. At the Recovery Console prompt, just type:
fixmbr
This fixes the master boot record.
206
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

The second problem the Recovery Console is best at fixing is missing
system files, usually indicated by the error NTLDR Bad or Missing. Odds
are good that if NTDLR is missing, so are the rest of the system files. To fix
this, get to the root directory (CD\—remember that from Chapter 10?) and
type the following line:
copy d:\i386\ntldr
Then type this line:
copy d:\i386\ntdetect.com

Common Recovery Console Commands

This takes care of two of the big three and leads us to the last issue, re-
building BOOT.INI. If the BOOT.INI file is gone or corrupted, run this com-
mand from the recovery console:
bootcfg /rebuild
The Recovery Console will then try to locate all installed copies of Win-
dows and ask you if you want to add them to the new BOOT.INI file it’s
about to create. Say yes to the ones you want.
If all goes well with the Recovery Console, then do a thorough backup as
soon as possible (just in case something else goes wrong). If the Recovery
Console does not do the trick, the next step is to restore Windows XP.
Attempt to Restore
If you’ve been diligent about backing up, you can attempt to restore to an
earlier, working copy of Windows. You have two basic choices, depending
on your OS. In Windows 2000, you can try the ERD. Remember the Emer-
gency Repair Disk contains critical boot files and partition information and is
your main tool for fixing boot problems in Windows 2000, but it is not
bootable. Windows XP limits you to the ASR.
If you elected to create an ERD in Windows 2000, you can attempt to re-
store your system with it. Boot your system to the Windows 2000 installa-
tion CD-ROM and select repair installation, but in this case opt for the ERD.
Follow the steps outlined earlier in the chapter and you might have some
success.
ASR can restore your system to a previously installed state, but you
should use it as a last resort. You lose everything on the system that was in-
stalled or added after you created the ASR disk.
Rebuild
If faced with a full system rebuild, you have several options, depending on
the particular system. You could simply reboot to the Windows CD-ROM
and install right on top of the existing system, but that’s usually not the opti-
mal solution. To avoid losing anything important, you’d be better off swap-
ping the C: drive for a blank hard drive and installing a clean version of
Windows.
Most OEM systems come with a misleadingly-named Recover CD or re-
covery partition. The Recover CD is a CD-ROM that you boot to and run. The
recovery partition is a hidden partition on the hard drive that you activate at
boot by holding down a key combination specific to the manufacturer of
that system. (See the motherboard manual or users’ guide for the key combi-
nation and other details.) Both “recover” options do the same thing—restore
your computer to the factory-installed state. If you run one of these tools,
you will wipe everything off your system—all personal files, folders, and
programs will go away! Before running either tool, make sure all important
files and folders are backed up on an optical disc or spare hard drive.
208
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
To use the Windows XP Sys-
tem Restore, you need to be
able to get into Windows. “Re-
store” in the context used here
means to give you an option to
get into Windows.

Failure to Load the GUI
Assuming that Windows gets past the boot
part of the startup, it will then begin to load the
real Windows OS. You will see the Windows
startup image on the screen (Figure 11.1),
hiding everything until Windows loads the
Desktop.
Several issues can cause Windows to
hang during the GUI-loading phase, such as
buggy device drivers or Registry problems.
Even autoloading programs can cause the
GUI to hang on load. The first step in trouble-
shooting these issues is to use one of the Ad-
vanced Startup options (covered later in the
chapter) to try to get past the hang spot and
into Windows.
Device Drivers
Device driver problems that stop Windows
GUI
from
loading
look
pretty
scary.
Figure 11.2 shows the infamous Windows Stop error, better known as the
Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) . The BSoD only appears when something
causes an error from which Windows cannot recover. The BSoD is not
limited to device driver problems, but device drivers are one of the reasons
you’ll see the BSoD.
Chapter 11: Windows Troubleshooting
209
• Figure 11.1
GUI Time!
• Figure 11.2
BSoD

Whenever you get a BSoD, take a moment and read what it says. Win-
dows BSoDs tell you the name of the file that caused the problem and usu-
ally suggest a recommended action. Once in a while these are helpful⎯but
not often.
BSoD problems due to device drivers almost always take place immedi-
ately after you’ve installed a new device and rebooted. Take out the device
and reboot. If Windows loads properly, head over to the manufacturer’s
Web site. A new device producing this type of problem is a serious issue that
should have been caught before the device was released. In many cases, the
manufacturer will have updated drivers available for download or will
recommend a replacement device.
The second indication of a device problem that shows up during the GUI
part of startup is a freeze-up: the Windows startup screen just stays there
and you never get a chance to log on. If this happens, try one of the Ad-
vanced Startup Options, covered in the upcoming section.
Registry
Your Registry files load every time the computer boots. Windows does a
pretty good job of protecting your Registry files from corruption, but from
time to time something may slip by Windows and it will attempt to load a
bad Registry. These errors may show up as BSoDs that say “Registry File
Failure” or text errors that say “Windows could not start.” Whatever the
case, you need to restore a good Registry copy. The best way to do this is the
Last Known Good Configuration boot option (see the upcoming section). If
that fails, then you can restore an earlier version of the Registry through the
Recovery Console.
Boot to the Windows installation CD-ROM, select the repair installation
to get to the Recovery Console, and type these commands to restore a Regis-
try. Notice I didn’t say “your” Registry in the previous sentence. Your Reg-
istry is corrupted and gone, so you need to rebuild.
delete c:\windows\system32\config\system

Advanced Startup Options
If Windows fails to start up, use the Windows Advanced Startup Options menu
to discover the cause. To get to this menu, restart the computer and press F8 af-
ter the POST messages, but before the Windows logo screen appears. Windows
2000 and Windows XP have similar menus. Central to these advanced options
are Safe Mode and Last Known Good Configuration.
There are several differences between the two operating systems in this
menu. First, the Windows 2000 option called Boot Normally is called Start
Windows Normally in Windows XP. In addition, Windows XP has options not
210

but that is not a choice in Win-
dows 2000/XP. Look for it as a
wrong answer on the exams!

available in Windows 2000: Disable automatic
restart on system failure and Reboot. A Win-
dows system with multiple operating sys-
tems might also have the Return to OS
Choices menu. Here’s a rundown of the
menu options.
Safe Mode
Safe Mode (Figure 11.3) starts
up Windows but loads only very basic,
non–vendor-specific
drivers
for
mouse,
VGA monitor, keyboard, mass storage, and
system services. Some devices, such as your
USB mouse, may not work!
Once in Safe Mode, you can use tools
like Device Manager to locate and correct
the source of the problem. When you use
Device Manager in Safe Mode, you can ac-
cess the properties for all the devices, even
those that are not working in Safe Mode.
The status displayed for the device is the
status for a normal startup. Even the net-
work card will show as enabled. You can
disable any suspect device or perform other
tasks, such as removing or updating drivers. If a problem with a device
driver is preventing the operating system from starting normally, check the
Device Manager for yellow question mark warning icons that indicate an
unknown device.
Safe Mode with Networking
This mode is identical to plain Safe Mode
except that you get network support. I use this mode to test for a problem
with network drivers. If Windows won’t start up normally, but does start up
in Safe Mode, I then reboot into Safe Mode with Networking. If it fails to
start up with Networking, then the problem is a network driver. I reboot
back to Safe Mode, open Device Manager, and start disabling network
components, beginning with the network adapter.
Safe Mode with Command Prompt
When you start Windows in this mode,
after you log on, rather than loading the GUI desktop, it loads the
command prompt (CMD.EXE) as the shell to the operating system, as
shown in Figure 11.4. This is a handy option to remember if the desktop
does not display at all, which, after you have eliminated video drivers, can
be caused by the corruption of the EXPLORER.EXE program. From the
command prompt, you can delete the corrupted version of EXPLORER.
EXE and copy in an undamaged version. This requires knowing the
command-line commands for navigating the directory structure, as well as
knowing the location of the file that you are replacing. Although Explorer
is not loaded, you can load other GUI tools that don’t depend on Explorer.
All you have to do is enter the correct command. For instance, to load
Event Viewer, type eventvwr.msc at the command line and press ENTER.
Chapter 11: Windows Troubleshooting
211
• Figure 11.3
Safe Mode

Enable Boot Logging
This option starts Windows normally and creates a
log file of the drivers as they load into memory. The file is named Ntbtlog.txt
and is saved in the %SystemRoot% folder. If the startup failed because of a
bad driver, the last entry in this file may be the driver the OS was initializing
when it failed.
Reboot and go into the Recovery Console. Use the Recovery Console
tools to read the boot log (type ntbtlog.txt) and disable or enable problem-
atic devices or services.
Enable VGA Mode
Enable VGA Mode starts Windows normally but only
loads a default VGA driver. If this mode works, it may mean that you have a
bad driver, or it may mean that you are using the correct video driver, but it
is configured incorrectly (perhaps with the wrong refresh rate and/or
resolution). Whereas Safe Mode loads a generic VGA driver, this mode
loads the driver Windows is configured to use, but starts it up in standard
VGA mode rather than using the settings for which it is configured. After
successfully starting in this mode, open the Display Properties and change
the settings.
Last Known Good Configuration
When Windows’ startup fails immediately
after installing a new driver, but before you have logged on again, you may
want to try the LastKnownGoodConfiguration option. This can be a rather fickle
and limited tool, but it never hurts to try it.
Directory Services Restore Mode (Does Not Apply to Professional)
The title
says it all here—this option only applies to Active Directory domain
controllers, and Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP can never be

• Figure 11.4
Safe Mode with command prompt

domain controllers. I have no idea why Microsoft includes this option. If you
choose it, you simply boot into Safe Mode.
Debugging Mode
If you select this choice, Windows 2000/XP starts in
kernel debug mode. It’s a super-techie thing to do, and I doubt that even
über techs do debug mode anymore. To do this, you have to connect the
computer you are debugging to another computer via a serial connection,
and as Windows starts up, a debug of the kernel is sent to the second
computer, which must also be running a debugger program. I remember
running debug for an early version of Windows 2000. My coworkers and I
did it back then simply because we were studying for the MCSE exams and
expected to be tested on it! We all decided that it was an experience that
didn’t need to be repeated.
Disable Automatic Restart on System Failure
Sometimes a BSoD will appear at startup, causing your computer to sponta-
neously reboot. That’s all well and good, but if it happens too quickly, you
might not be able to read the BSoD to see what caused the problem. Select-
ing Disable automatic restart on system failure from the Advanced Startup Op-
tions menu stops the computer from rebooting on Stop errors. This gives
you the opportunity to write down the error and hopefully find a fix.
Start Windows Normally
This choice will simply start Windows normally,
without rebooting. You already rebooted to get to this menu. Select this if
you changed your mind about using any of the other exotic choices.
Reboot
This choice will actually do a soft reboot of the computer.
Return to OS Choices Menu
On computers with multiple operating systems,
you get an OS Choices menu to select which OS to load. If you load Windows
XP and press F8 to get the Advanced Startup Options menu, you’ll see this
option. This choice will return you to the OS Choices menu, from which you
can select the operating system to load.
Troubleshooting Tools in the GUI
Once you’re able to load into Windows, whether through Safe Mode or one
of the other options, the whole gamut of Windows tools are available for
you. If a bad device driver caused the startup problems, for example, you
can open Device Manager and begin troubleshooting just as you’ve learned
in previous chapters. If you suspect some service or Registry issue caused
the problem, head on over to Event Viewer and see what sort of logon
events have happened recently.
Event Viewer might reveal problems with applications failing to load, a
big cause of Windows loading problems (Figure 11.5). It might also reveal
problems with services failing to start. Finally, Windows might run into
problems loading DLLs. You can troubleshoot these issues individually or
you can use System Restore in Windows XP to load a restore point that pre-
dates the bugginess.
Chapter 11: Windows Troubleshooting
213
Chapter 18, “Computer Secu-
rity,” goes into a lot more detail
on using Event Viewer, espe-
cially auditing, a way to trouble-
shoot a buggy system.

Autoloading Programs
Windows loves to autoload programs so they start at boot. Most of the time,
this is an incredibly handy option, used by every Windows PC in existence.
The problem with Autoloading programs is when one of them starts behav-
ing badly⎯you need to shut off that program!
There are at least five different locations in folders, files, and the Regis-
try that Windows accesses to autoload programs. To help you, Windows XP
includes the handy System Configuration Utility (MSCONFIG.EXE) , a one-
stop spot to see and maintain every program (and service) that autoloads
at startup (Figure 11.6).
The System Configuration Utility enables you to keep individual programs
and services from autoloading, but it does not actually remove the programs/
services. If you want to completely delete a program,
you’ll need to find the uninstall or Add/Remove Pro-
gram option. If the program doesn’t have either of
these, you’ll need a third-party tool like EasyCleaner
to delete the program.
Services
Windows loads a number of services as it starts. If
any critical service fails to load, Windows will tell
you at this point with an error message. The impor-
tant word here is critical. Windows will not report
all service failures at this point. If a service that is
less than critical in Windows’ eyes doesn’t start,
Windows usually waits until you actually try to use
a program that needs that service before it prompts
you with an error message (Figure 11.7).

MSCONFIG
Windows 2000 Professional

figuration Utility.

To work with your system’s services, go to the Control Panel |
Administrative Tools | Services and verify that the service you
need is running. If not, turn it on. Also notice that each service has
a Startup Type—Automatic, Manual, or Disabled—that defines
when it starts. It’s very common to find that a service has been set
to Manual when it needs to be set to Automatic so that it starts
when Windows boots (Figure 11.8).
System Files
Windows lives on dynamic link library (DLL) files. Almost every
program used by Windows⎯and certainly all of the important
ones⎯call to DLL files to do most of the heavy lifting that makes
Windows work. Windows protects all of the critical DLL files very
carefully, but once in a while you may get an error saying Win-
dows can’t load a particular DLL. Although rare, the core system
files that make up Windows itself may become corrupted, pre-
venting Windows from starting properly. You usually see some-
thing like “Error loading XXXX.DLL,” or sometimes a program
you need simply won’t start when you double-click on its icon. In
these cases, the tool you need is the System File Checker. The Sys-
tem File Checker is a command prompt program (SFC.EXE) that is
used to check a number of critical files, including the ever-impor-
tant DLL cache. SFC takes a number of switches, but by far the
most important is /scannow. Go to a command prompt and type
the following to start the program:
SFC /scannow
SFC will automatically check all critical files and replace any it
sees as corrupted. During this process, it may ask for the Windows
installation CD-ROM, so keep it handy!
System Restore
Windows XP systems enable you to recover from a bad device or applica-
tion installation by using System Restore to load a restore point. Follow the
process explained earlier in the chapter. System Restore is the final step in
recovering from a major Windows meltdown.

Chapter 11 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about troubleshooting Windows 2000/XP.
Troubleshooting Windows
■
The critical system files NTLDR, NTDETECT
.COM, and BOOT.INI must reside in the root
directory of the C: drive, and BOOT.INI must point
to the Windows boot files. If any one of these files
is missing or damaged, Windows will not start.
■
The Recovery Console works as a command-line
utility. Many of its commands should be familiar to
DOS users, but some new commands have also
been added. Because the file for the Recovery
Console is on the system partition in a folder called
CMDCONS, this program is useless for system
partition crashes, but it is excellent for restoring
registries, stopping problem services, or using
EXPAND to extract copies of files from the
CD-ROM. You can also use it to format hard drives
and read and write on local FAT or NTFS volumes.
■
The four items most likely to show up as problems
during the GUI portion of startup are device
drivers, the Registry, services, and system files.
Any one of these can cause a Windows Stop error,
more commonly known as the Blue Screen of
Death. If a driver is the problem, remove the
problem driver and install a new version from the
device manufacturer’s Web site.
■
You can restore the Registry by choosing the Last
Known Good Configuration boot option or use the
ASR to return to a restore point you made. You
may also boot into Recovery Console, delete the
corrupt Registry files, and copy backups from the
Repair directory.
■
Use Control Panel | Administrative Tools |
Services to manage your system’s services.
Common problems are caused by a service that
needs to start automatically, but is set to start
manually.
■
Use the System File Checker to verify important
system files and DLLs. At a command prompt,
type SFC /SCANNOW to have the System File
Checker automatically check all critical files and
replace any it sees as corrupt. Be sure to have your
Windows CD handy when you do this.
■
If Windows will not start, use the Advanced
Startup Options menu that is available when you
press F8 after POST and before the Windows logo
screen appears. You must log on as Administrator
and enter your password. Both OSs offer similar
menus, but may use different terminology such as
“Boot Normally” with Windows 2000 and “Start
Windows Normally” with Windows XP. XP also
includes two extra options: Reboot and Return to OS
Choices Menu. The two most commonly used
options are Safe Mode and Last Known Good
Configuration.
■
Safe Mode starts with only basic, non–vendor-
specific drivers. You can then use the Device
Manager to locate the source of the problem. Look
for warning icons such as a yellow question mark
indicating an unknown device or a yellow
exclamation mark indicating a conflict with an
existing device. If you have a problem with a
network driver, use the Safe Mode with Networking
option.
■
Another option is Enable Boot Logging, which
creates a log file of drivers as they load into
memory. If startup fails, the last entry in the file
may be a bad driver. If the Enable VGA Mode
works, you were using the wrong video driver or
had it configured for the wrong refresh rate or
resolution.
■
Debugging Mode starts Windows 2000/XP in
kernel debug mode and requires a serial
connection with another computer that is running
a debugger program. This is a high-end procedure
that you’ll probably never do.
■
The System Configuration Utility is useful in
managing programs and services that are set to run
at startup. You can disable items you suspect are
troublesome, reboot, and see if the problem has
gone away.

■Choosing a Video Card
Video card discussion, at least among techs, almost always revolves around the
graphics processor they use and the amount of RAM onboard. A typical video
card might be called an ATI Radeon X1950 XTX 512 MB, so let’s break that
down. ATI is the manufacturer, Radeon X1950 XTX is the model of the card as
well as the graphics processor, and 512 MB is the amount of video RAM.
Graphics Processor
The graphics processor handles the heavy lifting of tak-
ing commands from the CPU and translating them into
coordinates and color information that the monitor un-
derstands and displays.
Many companies make the hundreds of different
video cards on the market, but only two companies pro-
duce the vast majority of graphics processors found on
video cards: NVIDIA and ATI. NVIDIA and ATI make
and sell graphics processors to third-party manufactur-
ers who then design, build, and sell video cards under
their own branding. ATI also makes and sells its own
line of cards. Figure 12.1 shows an NVIDIA GeForce
7900 GT KO on a board made by EVGA.
Your choice of graphics processor is your single most
important decision in buying a video card. Low-end
graphics processors will usually work fine for the
run-of-the-mill user who wants to write letters or run

a Web browser. High-end graphics processors are designed to support the
beautiful 3-D games that are so popular today.
NVIDIA and ATI are extremely competitive, and both companies intro-
duce multiple models of graphics processors (and therefore new models of
cards) every year. However, unless you’re using the Vista Aero glass desktop,
all of these extra features you see in video cards are really only for the true driv-
ing force in video cards: 3-D gaming. Your PC is capable of providing you with
hours of incredible entertainment via a huge number of popular games that im-
merse you in 3-D environments full of light, shadows, explosions, and other
amazing effects that create a fun and beautiful gaming experience.
These 3-D games have special needs to do all this amazing stuff. One
need is textures. A texture is a small picture that is tiled over and over again
on walls, floors, and other surfaces to create the 3-D world. Take a look at
the wall in Figure 12.2. It’s made up of only three textures that are repeated
over and over again on the surface.
Games also use hundreds of lighting effects such as transparency (wa-
ter), shadows, reflection, and bump mapping—the process of laying multi-
ple textures on the same spot to give a more textured (bumpy) look to the
surface. These games are where the higher-quality graphics processors re-
ally shine. Learn more about 3-D issues in more depth in the “3-D Graphics”
section later in this chapter.
Choosing a graphics processor is a challenge because the video industry
is constantly coming out with new models. One of the best guides is price.
The best (and newest) graphics cards usually cost around US$400–500. The
cheapest cards cost around $50. I usually split the difference and go for a
card priced around $180 to $200—such a card will have most of the features
you want without breaking your bank account.
If you use your computer only for 2-D programs (most office applica-
tions such as word processors, e-mail, and Web browsers are 2-D), then al-
most all of the features of the more advanced graphics cards will do you
little good. If you’re not a gamer, a cheap, low-end video card will more
than meet your needs.
Video Memory
Video memory is crucial to the operation of a PC. It is probably the hardest-
working set of electronics on the PC. Video RAM constantly updates to reflect
every change that takes place on the screen. Video memory can prove to be a
serious bottleneck when working with heavy-duty applications (like games)
in three ways: data throughput speed, access speed, and simple capacity.
Manufacturers have overcome these bottlenecks in three ways: upping
the width of the bus between the video RAM and video processor; using
specialized, super-fast RAM; and adding more and more total RAM.
First, manufacturers reorganized the video display memory on cards
from the typical 32-bit-wide structure to 64, 128, or even 256 bits wide. This
would not be of much benefit because the system bus is limited to 32 or 64
bits—if it weren’t for the fact that video display cards are really coprocessor
boards. Most of the graphics rendering and processing is handled on the
card by the video processor chip rather than by the CPU. The main system
simply provides the input data to the processor on the video card. By mak-
ing the memory bus on the video card as much as eight times wider than the

Wall of textures

standard 32-bit pathway (256 bits), data can be manipulated and then sent to
the monitor much more quickly (Figure 12.3).
Specialized types of video RAM have been developed for graphics
cards, and many offer substantial improvements in video speeds. The single
most important feature that separates DRAM from video RAM is that video
RAM can read and write data at the same time. Table 12.1 shows a list of
common video memory technologies used yesterday and today⎯make
sure you know these for the exams!
Finally, many advanced 3-D video cards come with huge amounts of
video RAM. It’s very common to see cards with 64, 128, 256, or even 512 MB
of RAM! Why so much? Even with PCI Express, accessing data in system
RAM always takes a lot longer than accessing data stored in local RAM on
the video card. The huge amount of video RAM enables game developers to
optimize their games and store more essential data on the local video RAM.

■Installing and Configuring Video
Once you’ve decided on the features and price for your new video card or
monitor, you need to install them into your system. As long as you’ve got
the right connection to your video card, installing a monitor is straightfor-
ward. The challenge comes when installing the video card.
During the physical installation of a video
card, watch out for two possible issues: long
cards and proximity of the nearest PCI card.
Some high-end video cards simply won’t fit
in certain cases or block access to needed
motherboard connectors such as the IDE
sockets. There’s no clean fix for such a
problem—you simply have to change at least
one
of
the
components
(video
card,
motherboard, or case). Because high-end
video cards run very hot, you don’t want
them sitting right next to another card; make
sure the fan on the video card has plenty of
ventilation space. A good practice is to leave
the slot next to the video card empty to allow
better airflow (Figure 12.4).
Once you’ve properly installed the video
card and connected it to the monitor, you’ve
conquered half the territory for making the
video
process
work
properly.
You’re ready to tackle the drivers
and tweak the operating system,
so let’s go!
Software
Configuring your video software
is usually a two-step process. First
you need to load drivers for the
video card. Then you need to open
the Control Panel and go to the
Display applet to make your ad-
justments. Let’s explore how to
make the video card and monitor
work in Windows.
Drivers
Just like any other piece of hardware, your video card needs a driver to func-
tion. Video card drivers install pretty much the same way as all of the other
drivers we’ve discussed thus far: either the driver is already built into Win-
dows or you must use the installation CD that comes with the video card.
Video card makers are constantly updating their drivers. Odds are good
that any video card more than a few months old will have at least one

Install a Video Card
You know how to install an expansion card from your reading in earlier
chapters. Installing a video card is pretty much the same, so try this!
1.
Refer back to Chapter 5, “Installing Internal Devices,” for steps
on installing a new card.
2.
Plug the monitor cable into the video card port on the back of
the PC and power up the system. If your PC seems dead after
you install a video card, or if the screen is blank but you hear
fans whirring and the internal speaker sounding off long-short-
short-short, your video card likely did not get properly seated.
Unplug the PC and try again.

driver update. If possible, check the manufacturer’s Web site and use the
driver located there if there is one. If the Web site doesn’t offer a driver, then
it’s usually best to use the installation CD. Always avoid using the built-in
Windows driver as it tends to be the most dated.
We’ll explore driver issues in more detail after we discuss the Display
applet. Like so many things about video, you can’t really fully understand
one topic without understanding at least one other!
Using the Display Applet
With the driver installed, you’re ready to configure your display
settings. The Display applet on the Control Panel is your next stop.
The Display applet provides a convenient, central location for all of
your display settings, including resolution, refresh rate, driver in-
formation, and color depth.
The default Display applet window in Windows XP, called the
Display Properties dialog box (Figure 12.5), has five tabs: Themes,
Desktop, Screen Saver, Appearance, and Settings. Earlier versions
of Windows have a subset of these tabs. The first four tabs have op-
tions that enable you to change the look and feel of Windows and
set up a screen saver; the fifth tab is where you make adjustments
that relate directly to your monitor and video card. I’ll walk you
through each tab.
Making the Screen Pretty
Three tabs in the display applet have the job of adjusting the ap-
pearance of the screen: Themes, Desktop, and Appearance. Win-
dows themes are preset configurations of the look and feel of the
entire Windows environment. The Desktop tab (Figure 12.6) de-
fines the background color or image. It also includes the handy
Customize Desktop button that enables you to define the icons as
well as any Web pages you want to appear on the desktop.
The last of the tabs for the look and feel of the desktop is the
Appearance tab. Think of the Appearance tab as the way to
fine-tune the theme to your liking. The main screen gives only a
few options⎯the real power is when you click the Advanced but-
ton (Figure 12.7). Using this dialog box, you may adjust almost ev-
erything about the desktop including the types of fonts and colors
of every part of a window.
Screen Saver Tab
At first glance the Screen Saver tab seems to do nothing but set the
Windows screensaver⎯no big deal, just about everyone has set a
screensaver. But there’s another button on the Screen Saver tab
that gets you to one of the most important settings of your sys-
tem—power management. Click on the Power button to get to the
Power Options Properties dialog box (Figure 12.8).
These tabs define all of the power management of the system.
Power management is a fairly involved process, so we’ll save the

big discussion for where we need to save power the most⎯Chapter 14,
“Portable Computing.”
Settings Tab
The Settings tab (Figure 12.9) is the centralized location for configuring all of
your video settings. From the main screen, you can adjust both the resolution
and the color depth. Windows will only display resolutions and color
depths your video card/monitor combination can accept and that are
suitable for most situations. Everyone has a favorite resolution, and
higher isn’t always better. Especially for those with trouble seeing small
screen elements, higher resolutions can present a difficulty—already
small icons are much smaller at 1280 × 1024 than at 800 × 600. Try all of
the resolutions to see which you like—just remember that LCD moni-
tors look sharpest at their native resolution (usually the highest listed).
The color quality is the number of colors displayed on the screen.
You can change the screen resolution with a simple slider, adjusting the
color depth from 4-bit all the way up to 32-bit color. Unless you have an
older video card or a significant video speed issue, you’ll probably set
your system for 32-bit color and never touch this setting again.
Another option you may see in the Settings tab is dual monitors.
Windows supports the use of two (or more) monitors. These moni-
tors may work together like two halves of one large monitor, or the
second monitor might simply show a duplicate of what’s happening
on the first monitor. Dual monitors are very handy for those who
need lots of screen space but don’t want to buy a really large, expen-
sive monitor (Figure 12.10).

• Figure 12.9
Settings tab

There are two ways to set up dual monitors: plug
in two video cards or use a single video card that sup-
ports two monitors (a “dual-head” video card). Both
methods are quite common and work well. Dual
monitors are easy to configure—just plug in the mon-
itors and Windows should detect them. Windows
will show both monitors in the Settings tab, as shown
in Figure 12.11. By default, the second monitor is not
enabled. To use the second monitor, just select the Ex-
tend my Windows desktop onto this monitor checkbox.
If you need to see more advanced settings, click
on…that’s right, the Advanced button (Figure 12.12).
The title of this dialog box reflects the monitor and
video card. As you can see in the screen shot, this par-
ticular monitor is a ViewSonic A90 running off an
NVIDIA GeForce 6800 video card.
The two tabs you’re most likely to use are the
Adapter and Monitor tabs. The Adapter tab gives de-
tailed information about the video card, including
the amount of video memory, the graphics processor,
and the BIOS information (yup, your video card has a
BIOS, too!). You can also click on the List all Modes
button to change the current mode of the video card, although there’s no
mode you may set here that you cannot set in the sliders on the main screen.
If you’re still using a CRT, you’ll find the Monitor tab a handy place.
This is where you can set the refresh rate (Figure 12.13). Windows only
shows refresh rates that the monitor says it can handle, but many monitors
can take a faster—and therefore easier on the eyes—refresh rate. To see all
the modes the video card can support, uncheck the Hide modes that this moni-
tor cannot display option.
Chapter 12: Installing and Troubleshooting Video

• Figure 12.10
My editor hard at work with dual monitors
All LCD monitors have a fixed
refresh rate.
• Figure 12.11
Enabling dual monitors
• Figure 12.12
Advanced video settings

If you try this, always increase the refresh rate in small incre-
ments. If the screen looks better, use it. If the screen seems distorted or
disappears, wait a moment and Windows will reset back to the origi-
nal refresh rate. Be careful when using modes that Windows says the
monitor cannot display! Pushing a CRT past its fastest refresh rate for
more than a minute or two can damage it!
Most video cards add their own tab to the Advanced dialog box
like the one shown in Figure 12.14. This tab adjusts all of the special-
ized settings for that video card. What you see here varies by model
of card and version of driver, but here’s a list of some of the more in-
teresting settings you might see.
Color Correction
Sometimes the colors on your monitor are not
close enough for your tastes to the actual color you’re trying to
create. In this case, you can use color correction to fine-tune the
colors on the screen to get the look you want.
Rotation
All monitors are by default wider than they are tall. This
is called landscape mode. Some LCD monitors can be physically
rotated to facilitate users who like to see their desktops taller than
they are wide (portrait mode). Figure 12.15 shows the author’s LCD
monitor rotated in portrait mode. If you want to rotate your screen,
you must tell the system you’re rotating it.
Modes
Most video cards add very advanced settings to enable you to
finely tweak your monitor. These very dangerous settings have names such
as “sync polarity” or “front porch” and are outside the scope of both
CompTIA A+ certification and the needs of all but the most geeky techs.
These settings are mostly used to display a non-standard resolution. Stay
out of those settings!

Working with Drivers
Now that you know the locations of the primary video tools within the oper-
ating system, it’s time to learn about fine-tuning your video. You need to
know how to work with video drivers from within the Display applet, in-
cluding how to update them, roll back updates, and uninstall them.
Windows is very persnickety when it comes to video card
drivers. You can crash Windows and force a reinstall simply
by installing a new video card and not uninstalling the old
card’s drivers. This doesn’t happen every time, but certainly
can happen. As a basic rule, always uninstall the old card’s
drivers before you install drivers for a new card.
When you update the drivers for a card, you have a choice
of uninstalling the outdated drivers and then installing new
drivers— which makes the process the same as for installing a
new card—or if you’re running Windows XP, you can let it
flex some digital muscle and install the new ones right over
the older drivers.
Updating
To update your drivers, go to the Control Panel and double-

3-D Graphics
No other area of the PC world reflects the amazing acceleration of techno-
logical improvements more than 3-D graphics —in particular, 3-D gaming,
which attempts to create images that have the same depth and texture as ob-
jects seen in the real world. We are spectators to an amazing new world
where software and hardware race to produce new levels of realism and
complexity displayed on the computer screen. Powered by the wallets of
tens of millions of PC gamers always demanding more and better, the video
industry constantly introduces new video cards and new software titles that
make today’s games so incredibly realistic and fun. Although the gaming
world certainly leads the PC industry in 3-D technologies, many other PC
applications such as Computer Aided Design (CAD) programs quickly snatch
up these technologies, making 3-D more useful in many ways other than
just games. In this section, we’ll add to the many bits and pieces of 3-D video
encountered over previous chapters in the book and put together an
understanding of the function and configuration of 3-D graphics.
Before the early 1990s, PCs did not mix well with 3-D graphics. Cer-
tainly, many 3-D applications existed, primarily 3-D design programs such
as AutoCAD and Intergraph, but these applications used proprietary meth-
ods to generate 3-D graphics and often required the users to purchase

complete systems as opposed to simply dropping an installation disk into
their desktop system. Even though these systems worked extremely well,
their high cost and steep learning curves kept them hidden inside organiza-
tions such as design firms and government entities that needed them. UNIX
systems enjoyed 3-D graphics very early on, but even the most powerful
UNIX workstations of the early 1980s relegated almost all 3-D functions to
CAD applications.
The big change took place in 1992 when
a small company called id Software created
a new game called Wolfenstein 3D that
launched an entirely new genre of games,
now called first-person shooters (FPSs) (see
Figure 12.17). In these games, the player
looks out into a 3-D world, interacting with
walls, doors, and items, and shoots what-
ever bad guys the game provides.
Wolfenstein 3D shook the PC gaming
world to its foundations. The innovative
format turned Wolfenstein 3D and id Soft-
ware into overnight sensations. The folks
at id Software knew that their 3-D game re-
quired substantial RAM and CPU strength
for the time. They gambled that enough
systems existed to handle the massive cal-
culations required to keep track of the po-
sition of objects, keyboard inputs, and
most importantly, the incredibly complex
process of placing the 3-D world on the
screen. The gamble paid off, making John Carmack and John Romero, the
creators of id Software, the fathers of 3-D gaming.
Early 3-D games used fixed 3-D images called sprites to create the 3-D
world. A sprite is nothing more than a bitmapped graphic like a BMP file.
These early first-person shooters would calculate the position of an object
from the player’s perspective and place a sprite to represent the object. Any
single object would only have a fixed
number of sprites—if you walked around
an object, you noticed an obvious jerk as
the game replaced the current sprite with
a new one to represent the new position.
Figure 12.18 shows different sprites for
the same bad guy in Wolfenstein 3D.
Sprites weren’t pretty, but they worked
without seriously taxing the 486s and
early Pentiums of the time.
The second generation of 3-D began to
replace sprites with true 3-D objects,
which are drastically more complex than
a sprite. A true 3-D object is composed of
a group of points called vertices . Each
vertex has a defined X, Y, and Z position

in a 3-D world. Figure 12.19 shows the vertices for an air-
plane in a 3-D world.
The computer must track all the vertices of all the ob-
jects in the 3-D world, including the ones you cannot cur-
rently see. Keep in mind that objects may be motionless
in the 3-D world (like a wall), may have animation (like a
door opening and closing), or may be moving (like bad
monsters trying to spray you with evil alien goo). This
calculation process is called transformation and, as you
might imagine, is extremely taxing to most CPUs. Intel’s
SIMD and AMD’s 3DNow! processor extensions were ex-
pressly designed to perform transformations.
Once the CPU has determined the positions of all ver-
tices, the system then begins to fill in the 3-D object. The
process begins by drawing lines (the 3-D term is edges)
between vertices to build the 3-D object into many trian-
gles. Why triangles? Well, mainly by consensus of game
developers. Any shape works, but triangles make the
most sense from a mathematical standpoint. I could go into more depth
here, but that would require talking about trigonometry, and I’m gambling
you’d rather not read that detailed of a description! All 3-D games use trian-
gles to connect vertices. The 3-D process then groups triangles together into
various shapes called polygons . Figure 12.20 shows the same model from
Figure 12.19, now displaying all the connected vertices to create a large
number of polygons.
Originally, the CPU handled these calculations to create triangles, but
now special 3-D video cards do the job, greatly speeding up the process.
The last step in second-generation games was texturing. Every 3-D game
stores a number of bitmaps called textures . The program wraps textures
around the object to give it a surface. Textures work well as they provide
dramatic detail without the need to use a lot of triangles. A single object may
take one texture or many textures applied to single triangles or groups of tri-
angles (polygons). Figure 12.21 shows the finished airplane.

These second-generation games made a much
more realistic environment, but the heavy demands
of true 3-D often forced game designers to use both
3-D and sprites in the same game. Figure 12.22
shows the famous game DOOM. Note that the
walls, floors, doors, and such were 3-D images,
whereas the bad guys continued to manifest as
sprites. Notice how pixilated the bad guy looks
compared to the rest of the scene.
True 3-D, more often referred to as rendered ob-
jects, immediately created the need for massively
powerful video cards and much wider data buses.
Intel’s primary motivation for creating AGP was to
provide a big enough pipe for massive data pump-
ing between the video card and the CPU. Intel gave
AGP the ability to read system RAM to support tex-
tures. If it weren’t for 3-D games, AGP would almost
certainly not exist.
3-D Video Cards
No CPU of the mid-1990s could ever hope to handle the massive processes
required to render 3-D worlds. Keep in mind that in order to create realistic
movement, the 3-D world must refresh at least 24 times per second. That
means that this entire process, from transformation to texturing, must re-
peat once every 1/24th of a second! Furthermore, while the game re-creates
each screen, it must also keep score, track the position of all the objects in the
game, provide some type of intelligence to the bad guys, and so on. Some-
thing had to happen to take the workload off the CPU. The answer came
from video cards.
Video cards were developed with smart onboard graphics processing
units (GPUs) . The GPU helped the CPU by taking over some, and eventually
all, the 3-D rendering duties. These video cards not only have GPUs but also
have massive amounts of RAM to store textures.
But a problem exists with this setup: How do we talk to these cards? This
is done by means of a device driver, of course, but wouldn’t it be great if we
could create standard commands to speed up the process? The best thing to
do would be to create a standardized set of instructions that any 3-D pro-
gram could send to a video card to do all the basic work, such as “make a
cone” or “lay texture 237 on the cone you just made.”
The video card instructions standards manifested themselves into a se-
ries of application programming interfaces (APIs) . In essence, an API is a li-
brary of commands that people who make 3-D games must use in their
programs. The program currently using the video card sends API com-
mands directly to the device driver. Device drivers must know how to un-
derstand the API commands. If you were to picture the graphics system of
your computer as a layer cake, the top layer would be the program making a
call to the video card driver that then directs the graphics hardware.
Several different APIs have been developed over the years with two
clear winners among all of them: OpenGL and DirectX. The OpenGL stan-
dard was developed for UNIX systems, but has since been ported, or made

A mix of 3-D objects and sprites

compatible with, a wide variety of computer systems, including Windows
and Apple computers. As the demand for 3-D video became increasingly
strong, Microsoft decided to throw its hat into the 3-D graphics ring with its
own API, called DirectX. We look at DirectX in-depth in the next section.
Although they might accomplish the same task (for instance, translating
instructions and passing them on to the video driver), every API handles
things just a little bit differently. In some 3-D games, the OpenGL standard
might produce more precise images with less CPU overhead than the
DirectX standard. In general, however, you won’t notice a large difference
between the images produced using OpenGL and DirectX.
DirectX and Video Cards
In the old days, many applications communicated directly with much of the
PC hardware and, as a result, could crash your computer if not written well
enough. Microsoft tried to fix this problem by placing all hardware under
the control of Windows, but programmers balked because Windows added
too much work for the video process and slowed down everything. For the
most demanding programs, such as games, only direct access of hardware
would work.
This need to “get around Windows” motivated Microsoft to unveil a
new set of protocols called DirectX . Programmers use DirectX to take con-
trol of certain pieces of hardware and to talk directly to that hardware; it
provides the speed necessary to play the advanced games so popular today.
The primary impetus for DirectX was to build a series of products to enable
Windows to run 3-D games. That’s not to say that you couldn’t run 3-D
games in Windows before DirectX; rather, it’s just that Microsoft wasn’t in-
volved in the API rat race at the time and wanted to be. Microsoft’s goal in
developing DirectX was to create a 100-percent stable environment, with di-
rect hardware access, for running 3-D applications and games within
Windows.
DirectX is not only for video; it also supports sound, network connec-
tions, input devices, and other parts of your PC. Each of these subsets of
DirectX has a name like DirectDraw, Direct3D, or DirectSound.

Chapter 12: Installing and Troubleshooting Video

Microsoft constantly adds and
tweaks this list. As almost all games
need DirectX and all video cards
have drivers to support DirectX,
you need to verify that DirectX is in-
stalled and working properly on
your system. To do this, use the
DirectX diagnostic tool in the Sys-
tem Information program. After
you open System Information (it
usually lives in the Accessories |
System Tools area of the Start
menu), click the Tools menu and se-
lect DirectX Diagnostic Tool (see
Figure 12.23).
The System tab gives the version
of DirectX. The system pictured in
Figure 12.23 runs DirectX 9.0c. You
may then test the separate DirectX
functions by running through the
other tabs and running the tests.
So, what does DirectX do for
video cards? Back in the bad old
days before DirectX became popular
with the game makers, many GPU makers created their own chip-specific
APIs. 3dfx had Glide, for example, and S3 had ViRGE. This made buying 3-D
games a mess. There would often be multiple versions of the same game for
each card. Even worse, many games never used 3-D acceleration because it
was just too much work to support all the different cards.
That all changed when Microsoft beefed up DirectX and got more GPU
makers to support it. That in turn enabled the game companies to write
games using DirectX and have it run on any card out there. The bottom line:
When Microsoft comes out with a new version of DirectX, all the GPU com-
panies hurry to support it or they will be left behind.

■Troubleshooting Video
People tend to notice when their monitors stop showing the Windows desk-
top, making video problems a big issue for technicians. A user might tempo-
rarily ignore a bad sound card or other device, but they will holler like crazy
when the screen doesn’t look the way they expect. To fix video problems
quickly, the best place to start is to divide your video problems into two
groups⎯video cards/drivers and monitors.
Troubleshooting Video Cards/Drivers
Video cards rarely go bad, so the vast majority of video card/driver prob-
lems are bad or incompatible drivers or incorrect settings. Always make
sure you have the correct driver installed. If you’re using an incompatible
driver, Windows defaults to good old 640 × 480, 16-color VGA. A driver that
is suddenly corrupted usually doesn’t show the problem until the next re-
boot. If you reboot a system with a corrupted driver, Windows will do one
of the following: go into VGA mode,
blank the monitor, lock up, or display a
garbled screen. Whatever the output, re-
boot into Safe mode and roll back or de-
lete the driver. Keep in mind that more
advanced video cards tend to show their
driver as an installed program under Add
or Remove Programs, so always check
there first before you try deleting a driver
using Device Manager. Download the
latest driver and reinstall.
Video cards are pretty durable but
they do have two components that do go
bad: the fan and the RAM. Lucky for you,
if either of these goes out, it tends to show
the same error⎯bizarre screen outputs
followed shortly by a screen lockup. Usu-
ally, Windows keeps running; you may
see your mouse pointer moving around
and windows refreshing, but the screen
turns into a huge mess (Figure 12.24).
Chapter 12: Installing and Troubleshooting Video
235
• Figure 12.24
Serious video problem

Bad drivers sometimes also make this error, so al-
ways first try going into Safe mode to see if the prob-
lem suddenly clears up. If it does, you do not have a
problem with the video card!
The last and probably the most common problem
is nothing more than improperly configured video
settings. Identifying the problem is just common
sense⎯if your monitor is showing everything side-
ways, someone messed with your rotation settings; if
your gorgeous wallpaper of a mountain pass looks
like an ugly four-color cartoon, someone lowered the
color depth. Go into your Display Properties and re-
set them to a setting that works! The one serious con-
figuration issue is pushing the resolution too high. If
you adjust your resolution and then your monitor
displays an error message such as “Input signal out
of range” (Figure 12.25), then you need to set your
resolution back to something that works for your
video card/monitor combination!
Troubleshooting Monitors
Because of the inherent dangers of the high-frequency and high-voltage
power required by monitors, and because proper adjustment requires spe-
cialized training, this section concentrates on giving a support person the in-
formation necessary to decide whether a trouble call is warranted. Virtually
no monitor manufacturers make schematics of their monitors available to
the public because of liability issues regarding possible electrocution. To
simplify troubleshooting, look at the process as three separate parts: com-
mon monitor problems, external adjustments, and internal adjustments.
Common Monitor Problems
Although I’m not super comfortable diving into the guts of a monitor, you
can fix a substantial percentage of monitor problems yourself. The follow-
ing list describes the most common monitor problems and tells you what to
do—even when that means sending it to someone else.
■
Almost all CRT and LCD monitors have replaceable controls. If the
Brightness knob or Degauss button stops working or seems loose,
check with the manufacturer for replacement controls. They usually
come as a complete package.
■
For problems with ghosting, streaking, and/or fuzzy vertical edges,
check the cable connections and the cable itself. These problems
rarely apply to monitors; more commonly, they point to the video
card.
■
If one color is missing, check cables for breaks or bent pins. Check
the front controls for that color. If the color adjustment is already
maxed out, the monitor will require internal service.

• Figure 12.25
Pushing a monitor too hard

■
As monitors age, they lose brightness. If the brightness control is
turned all the way up and the picture seems dim, the monitor will
require internal adjustment. This is a good argument for power-
management functions. Use the power-management options in
Windows to turn off the monitor after a certain amount of time or
use the power switch.
Common Problems Specific to CRTs
The complexity of CRTs compared to LCDs requires us to look at a number
of monitor problems unique to CRTs. Most of these problems require open-
ing the monitor, so be careful! When in doubt, take it to a repair shop.
■
Most out-of-focus monitors can be fixed. Focus adjustments are
usually on the inside somewhere close to the flyback transformer. This
is the transformer that provides power to the high-voltage anode.
■
Hissing or sparking sounds are often indicative of an insulation
rupture on the flyback transformer. This sound is usually
accompanied by the smell of ozone. If your monitor has these
symptoms, it definitely needs a qualified technician. Having
replaced a flyback transformer once myself, I can say it is not worth
the hassle and potential loss of life and limb.
■
Big color blotches on the display are an easy and cheap repair. Find
the Degauss button and use it. If your monitor doesn’t have a
Degauss button, you can purchase a special tool called a degaussing
coil at any electronics store.
■
Bird-like chirping sounds occurring at regular intervals usually
indicate a problem with the monitor power supply.
■
Suppose you got a good deal on a used 17-inch monitor, but the
display is kind of dark, even though you have the brightness turned
up all the way. This points to a dying CRT. So, how about replacing
the CRT? Forget it. Even if the monitor was free, it just isn’t worth it;
a replacement tube runs into the hundreds of dollars. Nobody ever
sold a monitor because it was too bright and too sharp. Save your
money and buy a new monitor.
■
The monitor displaying only a single horizontal or vertical line is
probably a problem between the main circuit board and the yoke, or
a blown yoke coil. This definitely requires a service call.
■
A single white dot on an otherwise black screen means the
high-voltage flyback transformer is most likely shot. Take it into the
repair shop.
External Adjustments
Monitor adjustments range from the simplest—brightness and contrast—to
the more sophisticated—pincushioning and trapezoidal adjustments. The
external controls provide users with the opportunity to fine-tune the moni-
tor’s image. Many monitors have controls for changing the tint and satura-
tion of color, although plenty of monitors put those controls inside the
monitor. Better monitors enable you to square up the visible portion of the
screen with the monitor housing.
Chapter 12: Installing and Troubleshooting Video
237

Finally, most monitors have the ability to degauss themselves with the
push of a button. Over time, the shadow mask picks up a weak magnetic
charge that interferes with the focus of the electron beams. This magnetic field
makes the image look slightly fuzzy and streaked. Most monitors have a spe-
cial built-in circuit called a degaussing coil to eliminate this magnetic buildup.
When the degaussing circuit is used, an alternating current is sent through a
coil of wire surrounding the CRT, and this current generates an alternating
magnetic field that demagnetizes the shadow mask. The degaussing coil is ac-
tivated using the Degauss button or menu selection on the monitor. Degauss-
ing usually makes a rather nasty thunk sound and the screen goes crazy for a
moment—don’t worry, that’s normal. Whenever a user calls me with a fuzzy
monitor problem, I always have them degauss first.
Troubleshooting CRTs
As shipped, most monitors do not produce an image out to the limits of the
screen because of poor convergence at the outer display edges. Convergence
defines how closely the three colors can meet at a single point on the display.
At the point of convergence, the three colors will combine to form a single
white dot. With misconvergence, a noticeable halo of one or more colors will
appear around the outside of the white point. The farther away the col-
ors are from the center of the screen, the more likely the chance for
misconvergence. Low-end monitors are especially susceptible to this prob-
lem. Even though adjusting the convergence of a monitor is not difficult, it
does require getting inside the monitor case and having a copy of the sche-
matic, which shows the location of the variable resistors. For this reason, it is
a good idea to leave this adjustment to a trained specialist.
I don’t like opening a CRT monitor. I avoid doing this for two reasons:
(1) I know very little about electronic circuits, and (2) I once almost electro-
cuted myself. At any rate, the A+ exams expect you to
have a passing understanding of adjustments you
might need to perform inside a monitor. Before we go
any further, let me remind you about a little issue
with CRT monitors (see Figure 12.26).
The CRT monitor contains a wire called a
high-voltage anode covered with a suction cup. If you
lift that suction cup, you will almost certainly get seri-
ously electrocuted. The anode wire leads to the
flyback transformer and produces up to 25,000 volts.
Don’t worry about what they do;
just worry about what they can do
to you! That charge is stored in a
capacitor, which will hold that
charge even if the monitor is
turned off. It will hold the charge
even if the monitor is unplugged.
That capacitor (depending on the
system) can hold a charge for
days, weeks, months, or even
years. Knowing this, you should
learn how to discharge a CRT.

Cross Check
Dangerous Toys
The CRT doesn’t have a lock on being the only dangerous piece of
high-voltage equipment inside the PC. Check out Chapter 7, “Installing
and Troubleshooting Power Supplies,” and answer these questions:
1.
What other equipment should you avoid when working on a PC?
2.
Should you ground yourself at all times?

Discharging a CRT
There are 75,000 opinions on how to discharge a CRT
properly. Although my procedure may not follow the steps outlined in
someone’s official handbook or electrical code, I know this works. Read the
rules, and then look at Figure 12.27.
1.
Make sure everything is unplugged.
2.
If possible, let the monitor sit for a couple of hours. Most good
monitors will discharge themselves in two to three hours, and many
new monitors discharge in just a few moments.
3.
Get a heavy, well-insulated, flat-bladed screwdriver.
4.
Get a heavy gauge wire with alligator clips on each end.
5.
Do not let yourself be grounded in any way. Wear rubber-soled
shoes, and no rings or watches.
6.
Wear safety goggles to protect yourself in the very rare case that the
CRT implodes.
7.
Remove the monitor’s case. Remember where the screw went in.
8.
Attach one alligator clip to an unpainted part of the metal frame of
the monitor.
9.
Clip the other end to the metal shaft of the screwdriver.
10.
Slide the screwdriver blade under the suction cup. Make triple-sure
that neither you nor the screwdriver is in any incidental contact with
anything metal.
11.
Slide the blade under until you hear a loud pop—you’ll also see a
nice blue flash.
12.
If anyone is in the building, they will hear the pop and come
running. Tell them everything’s okay.
13.
Wait about 15 minutes and repeat.

The main controls that require you to remove the monitor case to make
adjustments include those for convergence, gain for each of the color guns,
and sometimes the focus control. A technician with either informal or for-
mal training in component-level repair can usually figure out which con-
trols do what. In some cases, you can also readily spot and repair bad solder
connections inside the monitor case, and thus fix a dead or dying CRT. Still,
balance the cost of repairing the monitor against the cost of death or serious
injury—is it worth it? Finally, before making adjustments to the display im-
age, especially with the internal controls, give the monitor at least 15 to 30
minutes of warm-up time. This is necessary for both the components on the
printed circuit boards and for the CRT itself.
Troubleshooting LCDs
■
If your LCD monitor cracks, it is not repairable and must be
replaced.
■
If the LCD goes dark but you can still barely see the image under
bright lights, you lost either the lamp or the inverter.
■
If your LCD makes a distinct hissing noise, an inverter is about
to fail.
■
You can find companies that sell replacement parts for LCDs, but
repairing an LCD is difficult, and there are folks who will do it for
you faster and cheaper than you can. Search for a specialty LCD
repair company. Hundreds of these companies exist all over the
world.
■
An LCD monitor may have bad pixels. A bad pixel is any single
pixel that does not react the way it should. A pixel that never lights
up is a dead pixel. A pixel that is stuck on pure white is a lit pixel,
and a pixel on a certain color is a stuck pixel. You cannot repair bad
pixels; the panel must be replaced. All LCD panel makers allow a
certain number of bad pixels, even on a brand-new LCD monitor!
You need to check the warranty for your monitor and see how many
they allow before you may return the monitor.
Cleaning Monitors
Cleaning monitors is easy. Always use antistatic monitor wipes or at least a
general antistatic cloth. Some LCD monitors may require special cleaning
equipment. Never use window cleaners or any liquid because the danger of
liquid getting into the monitor may create a shocking experience! Many
commercial cleaning solutions will also melt older LCD screens, which is
never a good thing.
Beyond A+
Video and CMOS
I’m always impressed by the number of video options provided in CMOS,
especially in some of the more advanced CMOS options. I’m equally
240
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

impressed by the amount of disinformation provided on these settings. In
this section, I’ll touch on some of the most common CMOS settings that deal
with video. You may notice that no power-management video options have
been included.
Video
Every standard CMOS setup shows an option for video support. The default
setting is invariably EGA/VGA. Many years ago, this setting told the BIOS
what type of card was installed on the system, enabling it to know how to
talk to that card. Today, this setting has no meaning. No matter what you
put there, it will be ignored and the system will boot normally.
Init Display First
This CMOS setting usually resides in an advanced options or BIOS options
screen. In multi-monitor systems, Init Display First enables you to decide
between PCIe and PCI as to which monitor initializes at boot. This will also
determine the initial primary monitor for Windows.
Assign IRQ for VGA
Many video cards do not need an interrupt request (IRQ). This option gives
you the ability to choose whether your video card gets an IRQ. In general,
lower-end cards that do not provide input to the system do not need an IRQ.
Most advanced cards will need one; try it both ways. If you need it, your sys-
tem will freeze up without an IRQ assigned. If you don’t need it, you get an
extra IRQ.

True-VGA devices only show 16 out of a possible 262,000 colors at a time.
The 16 current colors are called the palette. VGA Palette Snoop opens a video
card’s palette to other devices that may need to read or temporarily change
the palette. I am unaware of any device made today that still needs this
option.
Video Shadowing Enabled
This setting enables you to shadow the Video ROM. In most cases, this op-
tion is ignored as today’s video cards perform their own automatic shadow-
ing. A few cards require this setting to be off, so I generally leave it off now
after years of leaving it on.
SLI and Crossfire
A modern GPU can do some amazing things with video, creating a sense of
realism unparalleled in any other technology. Imagine what you could do if
you had multiple video cards working together. NVIDIA and ATI did just
that; both have come out with competing standards for splitting the
graphics processing load between two or more GPUs. NVIDIA calls their
standard Scalable Link Interface (SLI), and ATI calls theirs CrossFire. In both
cases, you install two identical video cards into PCIe slots and connect the
two with a tiny bridge card. Applications that understand the technology
Chapter 12: Installing and Troubleshooting Video
241
Some manufacturers have
produced video cards that have
two GPUs on a single card, en-
abling you to do SLI with a sin-
gle slot or, more importantly, to
do four GPUs in SLI using two
slots.

draw on both cards to produce a cinematic experience that no single card
could produce. Sweet, but expensive!
TV and PCs
It wasn’t that long ago that your television and your PC were two totally dif-
ferent devices, but those days are quickly changing. For years, all television
signals (at least in the U.S.) used the NTSC standard of 480 interlaced lines
and a refresh rate of 59.94 hertz. In the last few years, the high-definition
television standards of 480 non-interlaced (480p), 720p, 1080i, and 1080p are
bringing the technologies that made PC monitors so attractive into the realm
of television sets. Let’s talk about some of the new technologies and how
you might see them on your PC…err…I mean television.
TV Out
Many modern video cards offer an S-Video port to connect the computer to
a standard television set or projector. This is primarily aimed at gaming and
presentation software, offering a nice interface between the technologies.
The S-Video port is always one way, from the computer to the monitor or
projector, so it doesn’t offer television on the computer. For that, you need a
tuner card.
Tuner Cards
Okay, tuner cards aren’t that new, but man are they now getting popular! A
tuner card is simply a card that accepts television input signals from your ca-
ble television box or an antenna. Tuner cards come in regular TV versions
(NTSC tuners) and now high-definition versions called ATSC tuners. All of
these cards come with the necessary drivers and software so that you can
watch television on your PC (Figure 12.28).
Have you ever used the popular TiVo brand personal video recorder
(PVR)? TiVos are amazing! You plug them in between your cable box and
your television and then connect the TiVo to a phone line or network

connection (Figure 12.29). They en-
able you to pause live television
and record television shows to a
built-in hard drive. TiVo is propri-
etary and you have to pay the TiVo
people an ongoing fee to use it.
TiVo is so popular that now oth-
ers have copied the idea. You can
turn your PC into a PVR using noth-
ing but a tuner card, an Internet
connection, and the right software.
Companies such as SnapStream
(www.snapstream.com)
produce
programs like Beyond TV that give
you all the power of PVR for a very small, one-time price for the software. If
you like free (and hard to configure), you might want to consider the
Linux-based MythTV (www.mythtv.org). Even Microsoft has jumped into
the PVR game with its Microsoft Windows XP Media Center edition.
Even if you don’t want to turn your PC into a TV, you’ll find a number of
television technologies that have some overlap into the PC world. Let’s look
at those technologies and see how they fit into PCs.
HDMI
The newest video connector available today is the High-Definition
Multimedia Interface (HDMI). HDMI was developed to replace DVI for
televisions by combining both video and sound connections in a sin-
gle cable (Figure 12.30). HDMI also includes a feature called DDC.
DDC is similar to your PC’s plug-and-play feature. Imagine plugging
a DVD player into your TV using an HDMI cable. When this happens,
the two devices talk to each other and the TV tells the DVD player ex-
actly what resolutions it will support, making a perfect setup with no
user intervention.
HDMI
supports
High-Bandwidth
Digital
Content
Protection
(HDCP), an anti-copy feature (also called digital rights management)
designed to prevent unauthorized use of copyrighted material
(mainly High Definition DVDs). If you attempt to play an HD DVD
without HDCP, you will only get to watch that content in 480p, much
lower than the 1080p native resolution of HD DVD.
HDCP is controversial but it is here, even in PCs. You don’t need an
HDMI cable to support HDCP. Operating system programmers are work-
ing furiously to provide some way to support HDCP. If you decide you
want to play an HD DVD movie on your Windows Vista systems, go right
ahead, as HDCP support is built in!
Plasma
Plasma display panels (PDP) are a very popular technology for displaying
movies. Unfortunately, plasma TVs have two issues that make them a bad
choice for PC use. First, they have strange native resolutions (such as 1366 ×
768) that are hard to get your video card to accept. Second is burn-in—the
Chapter 12: Installing and Troubleshooting Video

tendency for a screen to “ghost” an image even after the image is off the
screen. Plasma TV makers have virtually eliminated burn-in, but even the
latest plasma displays are subject to burn-in when used with PC displays.
DLP
The final projector technology to discuss is Digital Light Processing (DLP).
DLP is a relatively new technology that uses a chip covered in microscopi-
cally small mirrors (Figure 12.31).
These individual mirrors move thousands of times per second toward
and away from a light source. The more times per second they move toward
a light source, the whiter the image; the fewer times they move, the grayer
the image. See Figure 12.32 for a diagram of how the mirrors would appear
in a microscopic close-up of the chip.
Figure 12.33 shows a diagram of a typical DLP system. The lamp pro-
jects through a color wheel onto the DLP chip. The DLP chip creates the im-
age by moving the tiny mirrors, which in turn reflect onto the screen.

DLP is very popular in home theater systems, as it
makes an amazingly rich image. DLP has had very little im-
pact on PC monitors, but has had great success as projec-
tors. DLP projectors are much more expensive than LCD
projectors, but many customers feel the extra expense is
worth the image quality.
Right…SED, FED
Wouldn’t it be nice to get a monitor that combined a
CRT’s excellent contrast ratio, color flexibility, and reso-
lution with an LCD’s thin profile and power-sipping
trait? Canon, Toshiba, and Sony (among others) have
been working on this Holy Grail monitor replacement for
some years now, and you might see production displays by the time you
read this book. The two technologies are surface-conduction electron emit-
ter display (SED) and field emission display (FED). Both put the electronic
equivalent of thousands of tiny electron guns into the display, one be-
hind each RGB phosphor, so you get the best of both CRT and LCD moni-
tors. (This is a gross oversimplification of the two technologies, of course,
but will suffice for a quick note here.)
At the time of this writing, SED technology seems a lot closer to commer-
cialization. At the Consumer Electronics Show in 2006, for example, Toshiba
debuted working prototypes that offered a jaw-dropping 10,000 to 1 con-
trast ratio. Toshiba claims that production models will hit a 100,000 to 1 con-
trast ratio (no, that’s not a typo!). It won’t be long, it seems, before you will
be able to replace your aging CRT or LCD with a SED monitor that practi-
cally sings, “I’m too sexy for my desk.…”

Chapter 12 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises,
you should understand the following about installing
and troubleshooting video.
Choosing a Video Card
■
Video cards are identified by their manufacturer,
model number, graphic processor, and amount of
video RAM. While a number of companies
produce video cards, the two major manufacturers
of graphics processors are NVIDIA and ATI. The
most important decision when buying a video card
is the graphics processor, especially if you play 3-D
games where texture and layering are important
considerations.
■
Video RAM has been improved over the years to
overcome the bottlenecks of data throughput speed,
access speed, and capacity by using specialized fast
RAM and adding more and more total video RAM.
Video memory technologies include VRAM,
WRAM, SGRAM, DDR SDRAM, DDR2 SDRAM,
GDDR3 SDRAM, and GDDR4 SDRAM.
Installing and Configuring Video
■
During the physical installation of a video card, be
conscious of long cards and proximity to other PCI
cards. Long cards simply don’t fit in some cases,
and close proximity to other expansion cards can
cause overheating.
■
Video card drivers install pretty much the same as
all other drivers: either the driver is already built
into Windows or you must use the installation CD
that comes with the video card.
■
As a basic rule, always uninstall an old video card’s
drivers before you install drivers for a new card.
■
The Display applet in the Control Panel provides a
convenient, central location for adjusting all of
your display settings, including resolution, refresh
rate, driver information, and color depth. The
Screen Saver tab provides access to the power-
management settings. The Settings tab provides
access for configuring all of your video settings
such as resolution, color depth, and dual monitor
configuration. The Settings tab also provides an
Advanced button for access to the Monitor and
Adapter tabs. The Adapter tab displays information
about your video adapter; the Monitor tab enables
you to set the refresh rate for your CRT monitor.
Most video cards add their own tabs to the
Advanced section.
■
Dual monitors can be configured by using a video
card with two monitor connectors or by using two
video cards. Either way, once both monitors are
connected, you can enable the second monitor
from the Display applet’s Settings tab.
■
Early 3-D games used sprites to create a 3-D world.
Later games replaced sprites with true 3-D objects
composed of vertices. Bitmap textures are used to
tile a section of the screen to provide a surface in
the 3-D world.
■
Video cards use a series of APIs to translate
instructions for the video device driver. If you
were to picture the graphics system of your
computer as a layer cake, the top layer would be
the program making a call to the graphics
hardware. The next layer is the API. The device
driver comes next, and way down at the base of the
cake is the actual graphics hardware—RAM,
graphics processor, and RAMDAC. OpenGL and
DirectX are the most popular APIs.
■
DirectX includes several subsets, including
DirectDraw, Direct3D, DirectInput, DirectSound,
DirectMusic, DirectPlay, and DirectShow. You can
verify your DirectX installation via the DirectX
Diagnostics Tool found under the Tools menu of
the System Information utility.
Troubleshooting Video
■
Video problems may be divided into two
categories: video cards/drivers and monitors.
■
If your screen is black or garbled, or if Windows
freezes after installing a video card driver, reboot
into Safe mode and roll back or delete the driver.
Check Add or Remove Programs first, as many
video card drivers show up there. If Safe mode
doesn’t fix the problem, you may have a bad video
card that needs to be replaced.
246
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

■
All monitors have replaceable hardware controls
(knobs and buttons). Check with the manufacturer
for replacement parts. Ghosting, streaking, or
fuzzy images may mean a bad or improperly
connected video cable, or the video card may be
the cause.
■
Monitor troubleshooting falls into two categories:
external and internal adjustments. Because
monitors have high-voltage power that can harm
or kill you, always leave it to trained professionals
to work inside the monitor.
■
Many CRT monitors have a button to degauss
themselves. When the shadow mask picks up a
weak magnetic charge, it interferes with the focus
of the electron beams, making the monitor appear
fuzzy or streaked. A built-in circuit called a
degaussing coil generates an alternating magnetic
field that eliminates the magnetic buildup on the
shadow mask.
■
Convergence defines how closely the three colors
meet at a single point on the display. With
misconvergence, one or more of the colors will
appear to have a halo outside the white point, with
the problem being more severe toward the outside
of the screen.
■
Clean CRT monitors with an antistatic monitor
wipe. Never use window cleaners or other liquids.
LCD monitors need special cleaning equipment or
a soft, damp cloth.
■
Common monitor problems are often related to
cable breaks or bent pins. Monitors also lose
brightness over time, especially if you are not
using the power-management functions.
■
For best performance, keep the screen clean, make
sure cables are tightened, use power management,
don’t block the ventilation slots or place magnetic
objects close to the monitor, and don’t leave the
monitor on all the time, even with a screensaver. If
the monitor is dead, use proper disposal methods.
■
A cracked LCD monitor must be replaced. If the
LCD screen goes dark, starts to hiss, or develops
bad pixels, it is best to either replace the monitor or
find a company specializing in LCD repair.

acing down the virtual track, pixels flying across the screen, hearing the
engine roar as you take another turn and press down the accelerator—or
surfing the Web for lovely scenic nature photos with the sweet, mellifluous
music of Mozart filling the room—sound has become an integral component of
the computing experience. Setting up and optimizing sound for the PC has
become an integral skill for all computer techs.
Correctly setting up sound for a PC requires that you know about quite a
few things, because the sound process has many components. You need a
properly installed sound card with the correct drivers loaded, reasonably
high-quality speakers, support software such as the API for a particular game
correctly configured in Windows, and a properly set up application that can use
the features of the sound card. And every great tech needs to know
troubleshooting to handle both routine and uncommon problems with sound.

■How Sound Works in a PC
Like the ripples that roll across a pond when you drop a rock in the center,
sound flows from a source in invisible but measurable waves that cause the
membranes in your ears to vibrate and create sound. The sophistication of
the human ear enables most people to differentiate the melodious from the
raucous, the loud from the soft. Computers aren’t nearly as sophisticated as
the human ear and brain, so clear standards are a must for converting music
into a format that a PC can use to record and play sound. Computer folks
use the terms capture and output instead of record and play.
Sound-Capture Basics
Virtually every PC today comes with four critical components for capturing
and outputting sound: a sound card, speakers, microphone, and recording/
playback software. Computers capture (record) sound waves in electronic
format through a process called sampling . In its simplest sense, sampling
means capturing the state or quality of a particular sound wave a set num-
ber of times each second. The sampling rate is measured in units of thou-
sands of cycles per second, or kilohertz (KHz). The more often a sound is
sampled, the better the reproduction of that sound. Most sounds in the PC
world are recorded with a sampling rate of from 11 KHz (very low quality,
like a telephone) to 192 KHz (ultra-high quality, better than the human ear).
Sounds vary according to their loudness ( amplitude ), how high or low
their tone ( frequency ), and the qualities that differentiate the same note
played on different instruments ( timbre ). All the characteristics of a partic-
ular sound wave—amplitude, frequency, timbre—need to be recorded and
translated into ones and zeroes to reproduce that sound accurately within
the computer and out to your speakers.
The number of characteristics of a particular sound captured during
sampling is measured by the bit depth of the sample, the number of bits
used to describe the characteristics of a sound. The greater the bit depth
used to capture a sample, the more characteristics of that sound can be
stored and thus re-created. An 8-bit sample of a Jimi Hendrix guitar solo, for
example, captures 28 (256) characteristics of that sound per sample. It would
sound like a cheap recording of a recording, perhaps a little flat and thin. A
16-bit sample, in contrast, captures 216 (65,536) different characteristics of
his solo and reproduces all the fuzzy overtones and feedback that gave
Hendrix his unique sound.
The last aspect of sound capture is the number of different tracks
of sound you capture. Most commonly, you can capture either a single track
( monaural ) or two tracks ( stereo ). More advanced captures record many
more sound tracks, but that’s a topic for a more advanced sound capture
discussion.
The combination of sampling frequency and bit depth determines how
faithfully a digital version of a sound captures what your ear would hear. A
sound capture is considered CD quality when recorded at 44.1 KHz, with

16-bit depth, and in stereo. Most recording programs let you set these val-
ues before you begin recording. Figure 13.1 shows the configuration set-
tings for the Windows Sound Recorder.
Hey, wait a minute! Did you notice the Format setting in Figure 13.1?
What’s that? You can save those sampled sounds in lots of different
ways—and that’s where the term format comes into play.
Recorded Sound Formats
The granddaddy of all sound formats is pulse code modulation (PCM) .
PCM was developed in the 1960s to carry telephone calls over the first digital
lines. With just a few minor changes to allow for use in PCs, the PCM format
is still alive and well, although it’s better known as the WAV format so com-
mon in the PC world. WAV files are great for storing faithfully recorded
sounds and music, but they do so at a price. WAV files can be huge, especially
when sampled at high frequency and depth. A 4-minute song at 44.1 KHz and
16-bit stereo, for example, weighs in at a whopping 40-plus MB!
What’s interesting about sound quality is that the human ear cannot per-
ceive anywhere near the subtle variations of sound recorded at 44.1 KHz
and 16-bit stereo. Clever programmers have written algorithms to store
full-quality WAV files as compressed files, discarding unnecessary audio
qualities of that file. These algorithms—really nothing more than a series of
instructions in code—are called compressor/decompressor programs or,
more simply, codecs . The most famous of the codecs is the Fraunhoffer
MPEG-1 Layer 3 codec, more often called by its file extension, MP3 .
Playing Sounds
A large number of programs can play sounds on a typical Windows com-
puter. First, virtually every Windows computer comes with Windows Me-
dia Player, possibly the most popular of all sound players. Figure 13.2
shows the default Media Player for Windows Vista. You can download
many other players, of course, including iTunes, Apple’s media program
for Windows and OS X. This is good, because not all sound players can play
all sounds.
MIDI
Every sound card can produce sounds, in addition to playing prerecorded
sound files. Every sound card comes with a second processor designed to
interpret standardized musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) files. It’s
important to note that a MIDI file is not an independent music file, unlike a
WAV file that will sound more or less the same on many different PCs. A
MIDI file is a text file that takes advantage of the sound processing hard-
ware to enable the PC to produce sound. Programmers use these small files
to tell the sound card what notes to play, how long, how loud, on which in-
struments, and so forth. Think of a MIDI file as a piece of electronic sheet
music, with the instruments built into your sound card.
The beauty of MIDI files is that they’re tiny in comparison to equivalent
WAV files. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, for example,

Sound Recorder settings
WAV and MP3 are only two
among a large number of file for-
mats for sound. Not all sound
players can play all of these for-
mats; however, many sound for-
mats are nothing more than some
type of compressed WAV file, so
with the right codec loaded, you
can play most sound formats.
Tech Tip
Compressing WAV
Files to MP3 Format
Using MP3 compression, it is pos-
sible to shrink a WAV file by a
factor of 12 without losing much
sound quality. When you com-
press a WAV file into an MP3 file,
the key decision is the bit rate. The
bit rate is the amount of informa-
tion (number of bits) transferred
from the compressed file to the
MP3 decoder in one second. The
higher the bit rate of an MP3 file,
the higher the sound quality. The
bit rate of MP3 audio files is com-
monly measured in thousands of
bits per second, abbreviated Kbps.
Most MP3 encoders support a
range of bit rates from 24 Kbps up
to 320 Kbps (or 320,000 bits per
second). A CD-quality MP3 bit
rate is 128 Kbps.
MIDI files have the file exten-
sion .MID in the PC world.

weighs in at a whopping 78 MB as a high-quality WAV file. The same
seven-minute composition as a MIDI file, in contrast, slips in at a svelte 60 KB.
MIDI is hardware dependent, meaning the capabilities and quality of
the individual sound card make all the difference in the world on the sound
produced. Sound cards play MIDI files using one of two technologies: FM
synthesis or wave table synthesis.
FM Synthesis
Early processors used electronic emulation of various instruments—a tech-
nique often called FM synthesis —to produce music and other sound effects.
Software developers could tell the sound processor to reproduce a piano
playing certain notes, for example, and a sound resembling a piano would
pour forth from the speakers. The problem with FM synthesis is that al-
though the modulation sounds okay for a single note, such as middle C, it
sounds increasingly electronic the farther up or down the scale you go from
that prime note.
Wave Table Synthesis
To address the odd techno-sound of early sound processors, manufacturers
began embedding recordings of actual instruments or other sounds in the
sound card. Modern sound cards use these recorded sounds to reproduce

• Figure 13.2

an instrument much more faithfully than with FM synthesis. When asked to
play a C note on a piano or on a viola, for example, the sound processor
grabs a prerecorded WAV file from its memory and adjusts it to match the
specific sound and timing requested. This technique is called wave table
synthesis . The number of instruments a sound card can play at once is called
the polyphony of that card—typically 64 sounds on better cards. Most mod-
ern sound cards have samples of 128 instruments—a veritable symphony
orchestra on a chip!
Other File Formats
The WAV, MP3, and MIDI formats may account for the majority of sound
files, but plenty of other less common formats are out there. Here are the ex-
tensions of some other sound file formats you may run into in the PC world:
■
AAC
Advanced Audio Coding is the native format for songs
downloaded into the Apple iTunes music library. The AAC format
is part of the MPEG-4 standard, offers better compression
algorithms than MP3, and is freely distributed. Apple wraps
downloaded songs in a Digital Rights Management (DRM)
encapsulation called FairPlay that gives them control over
distribution of those songs.
■
AIFF
Audio Interchange File Format files are a popular sound
format used on Macintosh computers. These files are often seen at
Web sites, and you can use the well-known QuickTime player to
play them.
■
ASX
Microsoft created the ASX format to facilitate streaming
audio over the Internet through Windows Media Player. It’s more
than just a format, though; it acts like a super playlist and enables
you to play other sound file types as well. The full name of the
format is Microsoft Advanced Streaming Redirector.
■
AU
This popular format is often seen in the Windows world.
Many different players can play these files, including players on
non-Windows systems, such as Sun, Next, UNIX, and Macintosh.
■
OGG
The Vorbis format is an open-source compression codec that
competes well with the proprietary AAC and WMA codecs, as well
as MP3. Vorbis files are saved with the .OGG filename extension, so
you’ll hear them (incorrectly) referred to as “Ogg” files.
■
RM
RealMedia files play either just audio or audio and video.
They are proprietary to RealMedia, a popular player often used on
the Internet. You must have RealMedia Player installed on your
computer to play these files.
■
WMA
Windows Media Audio is Microsoft’s proprietary
compression format.
This list scratches the surface of the 100-plus sound file formats available
out there, but it represents those you’re most likely to encounter.
Chapter 13: Sound and Multimedia
255
MIDI files are much less pop-
ular than other recorded formats
on computers, but every Win-
dows computer and every sound
card still fully supports MIDI.

Video
Recorded audio files and MIDI
files aren’t the only files that play
sounds on your computer. Video
files also have sound built into
them. However, to play the sound
that accompanies the video, the
video player program must support the particular video file format. The
most common video formats in the PC world are Audio Video Interleave
(AVI), Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG), QuickTime (MOV), Ad-
vanced Streaming Format (ASF), Real Media (RM), Windows Media Video
(WMV), DivX, and Flash. The popular video sharing site YouTube was
made possible by the amazingly small size of Flash-based video.
Applications
Many
applications,
especially
games, play sounds, too. In the
not-too-distant past, a game or an
application sometimes had its own
sound format, but most applica-
tions and games today use stan-
dard WAV, MP3, or MIDI files.
Streaming Media
Streaming media is incredibly pop-
ular on the Internet. Streaming me-
dia is a broadcast of data that is
played on your computer and im-
mediately
discarded.
Streaming
media has spawned an entire in-
dustry of Internet radio stations.
The three most popular streaming
media players are Windows Media
Player,
Winamp,
and
Apple’s
iTunes. ASF and RM are com-
pressed audio/video file formats
that
were
specially
created
to
stream over the Internet. With the
spread of broadband Internet, the
quality of streaming radio has im-
proved dramatically. In fact, it is
common to see Internet stations
streaming 128 Kbps and better
MP3 files. Some sites even have
surround-sound music for those
who
have
the
speakers
to
appreciate it.

Play Sounds in Windows
The typical Windows PC comes with a number of applications for play-
ing sound files. Take a tour of a typical Windows system to see these ap-
plications. This exercise uses Windows XP, but almost any version of
Windows (95 or later) will also work. For this exercise, you will need a
Windows XP or Vista system with a functioning sound card,
microphone, and speakers.
1.
Using the file search feature in Windows, locate all of the files on
your computer that have the extension .wav—all versions of
Windows come with a number of WAV files. Double-click one of
the files to play it. What program is associated with WAV files?
2.
Repeat step 1, but this time look for files with the extension .mid.
Not all versions of Windows have MIDI files. Double-click one of
the files to play it. What program is associated with MIDI files?
3.
From the Start button, search for any sound programs that may
be on your system. You’ll almost certainly run into Windows
Media Player and Sound Recorder, but check to see whether any
third-party programs are installed.
4.
If possible, install a popular sound player such as Winamp or
iTunes on your system. Both programs are free. You can get
Winamp at www.winamp.com and iTunes at www.apple.com/
itunes. Check Winamp’s help files to see what types of file
formats Winamp supports—a lot of formats!
5.
If you have an Internet connection, try running some streaming
audio. If you have Windows Media Player versions 7 through 10,
go to the Radio Tuner. If you are running Windows Media
Player 11 or later, go to the Media Guide. If you have Winamp,
try going to www.shoutcast.com. With iTunes, just click the
Radio link in the Library.

■Getting the Right Sound Card
Sound cards come with many built-in features, including two separate
sound processors (one for all of the recorded formats such as WAV and an-
other for MIDI), support chips for joysticks and other pointing devices that
plug into the game port, recording capabilities, support for MIDI instru-
ments, and more. All sound cards, from the cheapest to the most expensive,
can play music and drive a pair of speakers, so techs need to delve a little
deeper to understand the crucial differences among low-, mid-, and
high-end sound cards. Sound cards differ in five basic areas: processor capa-
bilities, speaker support, recording quality, jacks, and extra features.
But the sound card itself is only one part of the equation. You also need
good-quality speakers if you have any intention of listening to music or en-
joying some of the more advanced features such as surround sound.
Processor Capabilities
Sound processor capabilities differ dramatically from the low end to the
high end, even though the prices don’t reflect the great divide. The sound
processor handles the communication among the application, operating
system, and CPU and translates commands into sounds coming out of the
speakers. Low-end sound processors do little more than translate, which
means that the CPU has to do the heavy lifting on the processing front.
Better sound processors, in contrast, shoulder much of the processing
burden and bring a series of extra features to the table. By handling a lot of
the processing on board, these better sound processors free up the CPU for
other duties and, in effect and in name, accelerate the sound process. These
decent sound processors also provide excellent sound reproduction, so your
MP3s sound as awesome on your PC as they do on your stereo.
Most mid-range and all high-end sound processors offer support for
various surround sound standards, enabling equally equipped games and
other applications to provide positional audio effects and detailed sound
modeling—features that make PC gaming take on a whole new dimension.
You’ll learn about the various standards in detail in the “Speakers” section
of this chapter, but for now let an example suffice. With properly imple-
mented positional audio, when you’re sneaking down the hall, ready to
steal the Pasha’s treasure, you will hear behind you the sounds of the guards
marching up to capture you. Such added realism has many potential bene-
fits beyond games, but games are currently the primary beneficiary of this
technology.
Speaker Support
Every sound card supports two speakers or a pair of headphones, but many
better sound cards support five or more speakers in discrete channels. These
multiple speakers provide surround sound—popular not only for games

Tech Tip
Sound Cards
The hardware portion of sound-
processing equipment in the PC
comes either as a chip built into
the motherboard or on an expan-
sion card. Techs call both forms
sound cards, though technically
the first type is not a card at all.
Still, the generic term has stuck
for the time being.

but also for those who enjoy playing DVDs on their PCs.
The card shown in Figure 13.3, for example, supports up
to eight speakers.
Another popular speaker addition is a subwoofer. A
subwoofer provides the amazing low-frequency sounds
that give all of your sounds, from the surround sound of a
game to the music of a simple stereo MP3 file, an extra di-
mension. Almost all modern sound cards support both
surround sound and a subwoofer and advertise this with
a nomenclature such as Dolby Digital,
DTS, or 5.1. The 5 denotes the number of
speakers: two in front, two in back, and
one in the center. The .1 denotes the
subwoofer. Figure 13.4 shows one type of
surround speaker system. (You’ll learn
more about surround sound in the up-
coming “Speakers” section.)
Recording Quality
Almost every sound card has an input for a
powered microphone, but the high-end
cards record with substantially lower
amounts of noise or other audible artifacts.
The measure that describes the relative
quality of an input port is signal-to-noise
ratio
and is expressed in
decibels . The
smaller the number, the worse the card is
for recording, because you’ll more likely
get noise. Most sound cards at the low end
and in the mid range have a signal-to-
noise ratio of 30 to 50 decibels, which
makes them unacceptable for recording.
High-end cards offer a 96 to 100+ signal-
to-noise ratio, a level near what profes-
sional musicians use. Check the documen-
tation (see Figure 13.5) before you buy or
recommend a sound card for recording
purposes.
Jacks
Virtually every sound card comes with at
least three connections: one for a stereo
speaker system, one for a microphone,
and one for a secondary output called
line out. If you look at the back of a moth-
erboard with a built-in sound card,
you’ll invariably see these three connec-
tions (Figure 13.6). On most systems, the

main stereo speaker connector is
blue, the line-out connector is
green, and the microphone con-
nector is pink. You’ll often find
plenty of other connectors as well
(Figure 13.7).
Take a look at what these con-
nectors do for your sound card:
■
Line out
The line out is a secondary connector that is often used to
connect to an external device such as a cassette or CD player to
allow you to output sounds from your computer.
■
Line in
The line in port connects to an external device such as a
cassette or CD player to allow you to import sounds into your
computer.
■
Rear out
The rear out connector connects to the rear speakers for
surround sound audio output.
■
Analog/digital out
The multifunction analog/digital out
connection acts as a special digital connection to external digital
devices or digital speaker systems, and it also acts as the analog
connection to center and subwoofer channels. (See the “Speakers”
section later in this chapter for a discussion of surround sound.)
■
Microphone
The microphone port connects to an external
microphone for voice input.
■
Joystick
The joystick port connects a joystick or a MIDI device to
the sound card. The joystick port is a two-row DB15 female
connection, but as more and more peripherals go to USB, more
motherboard and sound card makers are dropping this venerable
port from their models.

Extra Features
With all motherboards including built-in sound these days, expansion
sound card makers have responded by adding a host of extra goodies and
abilities to their cards that, for some
folks, prove irresistibly tempting.
These include a digital output to in-
tegrate the PC with a home enter-
tainment unit, DVD receiver, and
surround sound speaker connec-
tion abilities; a breakout box that
adds recording and output ports in
a 5.25-inch bay; and a FireWire
connection for direct gaming, file
sharing,

device. Figure 13.8 shows a version
of the Creative Labs SoundBlaster
breakout box. These features aren’t
for everyone, but they are compel-
ling to many consumers.
Audio Cables
In the days of yore, if you wanted to play audio CDs through your sound
card, you needed a special cable that ran from your CD-ROM drive to the
sound card. These cables have been around for a while, but the connectors
were not standardized—for years, you had to use the cable that came with
your sound card and hope that it would connect to your CD-ROM drive.
Eventually, manufacturers standardized on a connector called MPC2
(Figure 13.9), and cables usually come with optical drives, not sound cards.
All modern systems run the audio from optical drives to sound cards
digitally through the computer, just like any other information, making the
MPC2 cable irrelevant. In fact, even if you connect the cable, the computer
won’t use it without software changes.
If you want to disable digital CD audio and use the old cable, go to the
properties of your optical drive. Right-click an optical drive in My Com-
puter and select Properties. Select the Hardware tab, select an optical drive
from the list of disk drives, and then click the Properties button. Select the
Properties tab (Figure 13.10) and then deselect the checkbox next to Enable
digital CD audio for this CD-ROM device.
Speakers
It always blows me away when I walk into someone’s study and hear tinny
music whining from a US$10 pair of speakers connected to a $2000 com-
puter. If you listen to music or play games on your computer, a decent set of
speakers can significantly improve the experience. Speakers come in a wide
variety of sizes, shapes, technologies, and quality and can stump the unin-
formed tech who can’t easily tell that the $50 set on the right sounds 100
times better than the $25 pair on the left (Figure 13.11).

Speaker Standards
The advent of surround sound in the computing world has cre-
ated a number of speaker standards. You should know these
standards so that you can choose the speakers that work best for
you and your clients.
Stereo
Stereo is the oldest speaker technology that you’ll see
in the PC world. Stereo speakers are just what you might
imagine: two speakers, a left and a right (Figure 13.12). The two
speakers share a single jack that connects to the sound card.
Most cheap speakers are stereo speakers.
2.1 Systems
A
2.1
speaker system consists of a pair of
standard stereo speakers—called satellites —combined with a
subwoofer (Figure 13.13). The average 2.1 speaker system has
a single jack that connects to the sound card and runs into the
subwoofer. Another wire runs from the subwoofer to the two
stereo speakers. If you want to enjoy great music and don’t
need surround sound, this is your speaker standard of choice.
Surround Speaker Standards
Going
beyond
standard
two-
channel (stereo) sound has been a goal in the sound world since
the 1970s. However, it wasn’t until the advent of Dolby
Laboratory’s Dolby Digital sound standard in the early 1990s
that surround sound began to take off. The Dolby Digital sound
standard is designed to support five channels of sound: front-left,
front-right, front-center, rear-left, and rear-right. Dolby Digital also
supports a subwoofer—thus, the term
5.1 . Another company,
Digital
Theatre Systems (DTS) , created a competing standard that also supported
a 5.1 speaker system. When DVDs were introduced, they included both
Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 standards, making 5.1 speakers an overnight
requirement for home theater. If you want to enjoy your DVDs in full

surround sound on your PC, you must purchase a full 5.1 speaker system.
A number of 5.1 speaker systems are available for PCs. The choice you make
is usually determined by what sounds best to you.
Many sound cards also come with a special Sony/Philips digital interface
(S/PDIF) connector that enables you to connect your sound card directly to
a 5.1 speaker system or receiver (Figure 13.14). Using a single S/PDIF
instead of a tangle of separate wires for each speaker greatly simplifies your
sound setup. S/PDIF connections come in two types, optical and coaxial.
The optical variety looks like a square with a small door (at right in
Figure 13.14). The coaxial is a standard RCA connector (at left), the same
type used to connect a CD player to your stereo. It doesn’t matter which one
you use; just make sure you have an open spot on your receiver or speakers.
Games can also take advantage of 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 speakers, but they use
the DirectX standard. DirectX offers numerous commands, also known as
APIs, that issue instructions such as “make a sound on the right speaker” or
“play music in both the right and left channels.” DirectX simplifies the pro-
gramming needed to create sound and video: rather than having to pro-
gram sounds in different ways for each sound card option, games can talk
DirectX; the hardware manufacturers simply have to ensure that their
sound cards are DirectX compatible.
DirectX version 3 introduced
DirectSound3D (DS3D) , which offered
a range of commands to place a sound anywhere in 3-D space. Known as
positional audio , it fundamentally changed the way most PC games were
played. DS3D could not handle all sound information, but it supported
extensions to its instructions for more advanced sound features. This
challenged the sound card designers to develop more fully the concept of
positional audio. Creative Labs responded by rolling out environmental
audio extensions (EAX) , a set of audio presets that gave developers the
capability to create a convincing sense of environment in entertainment
titles and a realistic sense of distance between the player and audio
events. Figure 13.15 shows an EAX setup screen.

S/PDIF connectors
Only a few 5.1 PC speaker
sets come with S/PDIF. In most
cases, you’ll have to use the reg-
ular audio outputs on the sound
card. You’ll find the connector
more common on 6.1 and 7.1
sets.

In late 2000, a number of EAX effects were incorporated into the DirectX
audio component of DirectX 8.0. This signaled the acceptance of EAX as the
standard for audio effects in gaming. Shortly afterward, Creative Labs
started releasing audio cards that were Dolby 5.1 compatible out of the box.
This let you plug a 5.1 speaker system directly into your sound card. The
sound card automatically decoded the Dolby/DTS sound track when you
played a DVD and the EAX effects when you played a game that supports it.
All current sound cards support DirectX and EAX.
Speaker Features
Speakers also come with a few other features that you should consider when
choosing a set for yourself or your clients. Speakers offer a variety of power
sources, controls accessibility, and headphone jacks.
Controls
All speakers have volume controls as well as an on/off switch.
Get a system that provides easy access to those controls by placing them on
an easy-to-reach speaker or on a special control box.
Headphone Jack
The problem with headphones is that you need to plug
them into the back of the sound card and then tell Windows to output to
them from the Sound applet on the Control Panel. Save yourself a lot of
hassle and get a speaker system that has a handy microphone jack on one
of the speakers or on a control box.

Not all cards support Dolby
Digital/DTS. Most software DVD
players and some sound cards
support Dolby Digital. DTS sup-
port is a little harder to come by.
Check the manufacturer’s Web
site to determine whether your
card will work with DTS.

■Installing Sound in a
Windows System
You’ve got two choices for sound hardware on today’s PCs: onboard sound
built into the motherboard or a separate sound card. The installation process
for a sound card is basically the same as the process for any other card. You
snap the card into a slot, plug some speakers into the card, load a driver—
and for the most part, you’re done. With onboard sound, you need to make
sure the sound is enabled in your CMOS and then load the driver. As with
most of the devices discussed in this book, sound card installation consists
of three major parts: physical installation, device driver installation, and
configuration.
Physical Installation
Physical installation is easy. Onboard sound is already
physically installed and most sound cards are run-
of-the-mill PCI cards (Figure 13.16). The real trick to
physical installation is deciding where to plug in the
speakers, microphone, and so on. The surround sound
devices so common today feature a variety of jacks, so
you will probably want to refer to your sound card doc-
umentation for details, but here are a few guidelines:
■
The typical stereo or 2.1 speaker system will use
only a single jack. Look for the jack labeled
Speaker or Speaker 1.
■
Surround speakers either use a single digital
(S/PDIF) connection, which in most cases runs
from the sound card to the subwoofer, or they
need three separate cables: one for the front two
speakers that runs to the Speaker 1 connector, one
for the back two speakers that runs to the
Speaker 2 connector, and a third cable for the
center channel and subwoofer that runs to the
digital/audio out or Speaker 3 connector.
Here’s a quick look at sound card installation. As
with any PCI card, you’ll need a Phillips-head screwdriver to install a sound
card, as well as your electrostatic discharge (ESD) prevention equipment. Of
course, you’ll also need the sound card itself, a set of speakers, an audio ca-
ble if it’s an older system, and a microphone if you want to be able to record
sounds.
1.
Shut down your computer, unplug it, and open the case.
2.
Find an open PCI slot and snap in the sound card. Remember to
handle the card with tender loving care—especially if you’re
installing an expensive, high-end card! Make sure that the card is
securely seated, and secure it to the chassis with a hex screw.

• Figure 13.16
Typical sound card

3.
If you’re installing into an
older system, connect the CD
audio cable to the back of the
optical drive, and plug the
other end into the CD audio
port on your sound card. Be
sure to use the correct
connector—many sound
cards have multiple audio
connectors. The one shown in
Figure 13.17, for example,
has separate connectors to
use for an optical drive or
modem. This step is
irrelevant in modern systems.
Installing Drivers
Once the sound card is installed, start the system and let Windows install
the card’s drivers. This applies to expansion cards and onboard sound. As
you might expect by now, you’ll probably have a choice between the built-in
Windows drivers and the driver that comes on a CD-ROM with your sound
card. Just as with other cards, it’s always best to install the driver that comes
with the card. All sound devices have easy-to-use autoplay-enabled instal-
lation CD-ROMs that step you through the process (Figure 13.18).
You might run into one of the USB sound cards out on the market
(Figure 13.19), in which case the installation process is reversed. The only
secret to these devices is to follow the important rule of all USB devices:
install the drivers before you plug in the device. Windows, especially Windows
XP and Vista, probably have basic drivers for these USB sound cards, but
don’t take a chance⎯always install the drivers first!
After your sound card and driver are installed, make a quick trip to the
Device Manager to ensure that the driver was installed correctly, and you’re
two-thirds of the way there. Installing the driver is never the last step for a

moment to check the manufac-
turer’s Web site to see whether
your sound card has any driver
updates.

sound card. Your final step is to configure the sound card using configura-
tion programs and test it using an application. Most sound cards come with
both special configuration programs and a few sound applications on the
same CD-ROM that supplies the drivers. Take a look at these extra bits of
software that I call sound programs.
Installing Sound Programs
You’ve already seen that you need a program to play sounds on your PC:
Windows Media Player, Winamp, or something similar. But two other
classes of sound programs also reside on your computer: programs for the
configuration of your sound card and special applications that may or may
not come with your sound card.
Configuration Applications
Every Windows computer comes with at least one important sound config-
uration program built right into the operating system: the Control Panel ap-
plet called
Sounds and Audio Devices
in Windows XP or Sounds and
Multimedia in Windows 2000. Whatever the name, this applet (or applets)
performs the same job: it provides a location for performing most or all the
configuration you need for your sound card. Consider the Sounds and Au-
dio Devices applet in Windows XP, for example; the Sounds and Multime-
dia applet in Windows 2000 works roughly the same, although it may have
one control or another in a different place.
The Sounds and Audio Devices applet has five tabs: Volume, Sounds,
Audio, Voice, and Hardware. The Volume tab is the most interesting. This
tab adjusts the volume for the speakers, and it allows you to set up the type
of speaker system you have, as shown in Figure 13.20.
The Sounds tab allows you to add customized sounds
to Windows events, such as the startup of a program or
Windows shutdown. The Audio tab (Figure 13.21) and
Voice tab do roughly the same thing: they allow you to
specify the device used for input and output of general
sounds (Audio tab) and voice (Voice tab). These settings
are handy for folks like me who have a regular micro-
phone and speakers but also use a headset with micro-
phone for voice recognition or Internet telephone
software. By telling Windows to use the microphone for
normal sounds and to use the headset for voice recogni-
tion, I don’t have to make any manual changes when I
switch from listening to an MP3 to listening to my brother
when he calls me over the Internet.
The Hardware tab isn’t used very often, but it does
have one interesting feature: it shows you all of the
audio and video codecs installed in your system
(Figure 13.22). Not long ago, you had to install codecs
manually in your system to play certain compressed file
formats. Today, most audio players automatically
detect whether a file is using an unrecognized codec
and will download the proper codec for you.

Proprietary Configuration Applications
Many sound cards install proprietary software to support configuration fea-
tures not provided by Windows. Figure 13.23 shows one such application.
This special configuration application comes with Creative Labs sound
cards to add a few tweaks to the speaker setup that the Sounds and Audio
Devices applet doesn’t support.

Most sound cards come with some form of configura-
tion program that works with the Control Panel applet to
tweak the sound the way you want it. Figure 13.24 shows
the applet that came with my motherboard. One of its many
interesting features is to detect what types of devices are in-
stalled into the sound ports and adjust the system to use
them. In other words, I don’t even have to look where I’m
plugging in anything! If I plug a microphone into the front
speakers port, the system just adjusts the outputs⎯very
cool. Software and sound cards that can do this are called
autosensing .
Take some time to experiment with the program that
comes with your sound card—this is a great way to learn
about some of the card’s features that you might otherwise
not even know are there!
Installing Applications
Some sound cards—Creative Labs sound cards are by far the most infamous
for this—install one or more applications, ostensibly to improve your sound
experience. These are not the configuration programs just described. These
programs do anything from organizing your sound files to enabling you to
compose music. Personally, I don’t have a need for a 3DMIDI Player pro-
gram (Figure 13.25)—but you might be just the type of person who loves it.

Be sure at least to install the applications that come with your card. If you
don’t like them, you can easily uninstall them.
■Troubleshooting Sound
The problems you’ll run into with sound seem to fall into one of two camps:
those that are embarrassingly simple to repair and those that defy any possi-
ble logic and are seemingly impossible to fix. This section divides sound
problems into three groups—hardware, configuration, and application
problems—and gives you some ideas on how to fix these problems.
Hardware Problems
Hardware problems are by far the most common sound problems, espe-
cially if your sound card has worked for some amount of time already.
Properly installed and configured sound cards almost never suddenly stop
making sounds.
Volume
The absolute first item to check when a sound dies is the volume controls.
Remember that you can set the volume in two places: in software and on the
speakers. I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve lost sound only to discover
that my wife turned down the volume on the speakers. If the speaker vol-
ume is okay, open the volume controls in Windows (Figure 13.26) by click-
ing the little speaker icon on the system tray, and make sure that both the
master volume and the volume of the other controls are turned up.
Speakers
The second place to look for sound problems is the speakers. Make sure
that the speakers are turned on and are getting good power. Then make
sure the speakers are plugged into the proper connection on the back of the
Chapter 13: Sound and Multimedia
269
If your system tray (i.e., the
notification area) is cluttered and
the little speaker icon hard to
find, you can access the Play
Control dialog box by opening
the Sounds and Audio Devices
applet in the Control Panel. On
the Volume tab—the one that’s
on top by default—click the Ad-
vanced button under Device
Volume. If you don’t have a little
speaker in your system tray at
all, you can add it. Just check the
box next to the Place volume
icon in the taskbar option in the
Volume tab of the Sound and
Audio Devices Properties
dialog box. Presto!

sound card. If this all checks out, try playing a sound using any sound pro-
gram. If the sound program looks like it is playing—maybe the application
has an equalizer that is moving or a status marker that shows that the ap-
plication is playing the sound—you may have blown speakers. Try an-
other pair and see if the sound returns.
Configuration Problems
Configuration errors occur when the sound card is physically good but
some setting hasn’t been properly configured. I also include drive problems
in this category. These errors happen almost exclusively at installation, but
they can appear on a working system, too.
The first place to check is the Device Manager. If the driver has a prob-
lem, you’ll see it right there. Try reinstalling the driver. If the driver doesn’t
show any problems, again try playing a sound and see if the player acts as
though the sound is playing. If that’s the case, you need to start touring
the Sounds and Audio Devices applet to see if you’ve made a configuration
error—perhaps you have the system configured for 5.1 when you have a ste-
reo setup, or maybe you set the default sound output device to some other
device. Take your time and look—configuration errors always show
themselves.
Application Problems
Application problems are always the hardest to fix and tend to occur on a
system that was previously playing sounds without trouble.
First, look for an error message (Figure 13.27). If an error code appears,
write it down exactly as you see it and head to the program’s support site.
Odds are very good that if you have the error text, you’ll get the fix right
away from the support site. Of course, you can always hope the built-in help
has some support, but help systems tend to be a little light in providing real
fixes.
Don’t always blame the sound application—remember that any sound
file might be corrupted. Most sound players will display a clear error mes-
sage, but not always. Try playing the sound file using another application.
Last, a good approach almost always is to reinstall the application.

Tech Tip
Sound Quality
Most of the time, speakers come in
a matched set—whether it’s a 2.1,
4.1, 5.1, or other system— and the
manufacturer will include ade-
quate connecting wires for the
whole set. On occasion, you might
run into a system in which the
user has connected pairs of speak-
ers from different sets or rigged a
surround-sound system by replac-
ing the stock wires with much
longer wires. Either option can
create a perfectly functional sur-
round-sound system that works
for a specific room, but you should
make sure that all the speakers
require the same wattage and
that high-quality wire is used to
connect them.
If you troubleshoot a system in
which two are of the speakers are
very quiet and two are very loud,
the wattages are probably differ-
ent between the two pairs. A sim-
ple check of the labels should
suffice to troubleshoot, or you can
swap out one pair for a different
pair and see if that affects the vol-
ume issues. Cheap wire, on the
other hand, simply degrades the
sound quality. If the speakers
sounded good before getting
strung on long wires, but they
now have a lot of low-grade noise,
blame the wires.
Technically speaking, turning
down the volume in the volume
control program is not a config-
uration problem; it’s just some-
thing I always check at the same
time that I check the volume on
the speakers.

Sound Card Benchmarking
Sound cards can demand a huge share of system resources—particularly
CPU time—during intense work (like gaming). Most techs who find an oth-
erwise serviceable PC stuttering during games will immediately blame the
video card or the video card drivers. What they don’t realize is that sound
cards can be the cause of the problem. A recent test of a client’s built-in au-
dio, for example, revealed that at peak usage the sound card took more than
30 percent of the CPU cycles. Thirty percent? Holy smokes! And he won-
dered why his Pentium III system bogged down on yesterday’s games! He
could just forget about playing Half-Life 2 or DOOM 3.
The folks at iXBT.com/Digit-Life make an excellent suite of sound card
benchmarking utilities that helps you analyze the particulars of any sound
card: RightMark 3DSound (Figure 13.28). It will run a system through fairly
serious tests, from regular sound to 3-D positional audio, and will reveal
whether or not the sound processor—built-in or expansion card—is causing
a problem with resource use. You can find the utility at http://audio
.rightmark.org.

Chapter 13 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
aspects of sound.
How Sound Works in a PC
■
The process by which sounds are stored in
electronic format on your PC is called sampling.
Sampling means capturing the state or quality of a
particular sound wave a set number of times each
second. All the characteristics of a particular sound
wave—amplitude, frequency, and timbre—need to
be recorded and translated into ones and zeroes to
reproduce that sound accurately within the
computer and out to your speakers. Sounds are
sampled thousands of times per second. The
amount of information stored at each sampling is
called the bit depth, and the higher the bit depth,
the better the recording.
■
The popular WAV file format (as well as most other
recorded sound formats) is based on PCM. WAV
files can be huge, especially when sampled at high
frequency and depth, so compression is a popular
way to reduce the file size of recorded sounds. The
most popular compressed file type is MP3.
■
To play sounds, you must have some form of
player software, such as Windows Media Player.
Not all players can play all types of sound files.
Some file formats, such as RealMedia, require their
own proprietary players.
■
MIDI files are not recordings like WAV files. A
MIDI file is a text file that takes advantage of the
sound processing hardware to enable the PC to
produce sound. Programmers use these small files
to tell the sound card what notes to play, how long,
how loud, on which instruments, and so forth.
■
Sound cards use one of two methods to store notes
for MIDI: FM synthesis or wave table synthesis.
FM synthesis electronically simulates various
instruments, whereas wave table synthesis uses
pre-recorded instruments.
■
A large number of other sound file formats is
available, such as AAC and WMA. Sounds can also
be found in video formats, applications, and
streaming media, such as the Flash videos on
YouTube.
Getting the Right Sound Card
■
Low-end sound processors do little more than
translate, which means that the CPU has to do the
heavy lifting on the processing front. Better sound
processors, in contrast, shoulder much of the
processing burden and bring a series of extra
features to the table. Most mid-range and all
high-end sound processors offer support for
various surround sound standards, enabling
equally equipped games and other applications to
provide positional audio effects and detailed
sound modeling.
■
Every sound card supports two speakers or a pair
of headphones, but many better sound cards
support five or more speakers in discrete channels.
These multiple speakers provide surround sound
and thumping bass through a subwoofer.
■
Better sound cards have a lower signal-to-noise
ratio and support for multiple audio connections,
such as a microphone, line in, and S/PDIF. The
latter is for high-end audio.
■
Speaker standards include stereo (which uses a left
speaker and a right speaker), 2.1 (stereo with an
additional subwoofer), and surround sound. Do
yourself or your client a favor and spend the extra
money for good speakers. They’re not that much
more than cheap speakers, and they make an
enormous difference for the user experience.
■
Surround sound is popular for games and DVD
movies. A number of surround sound standards
exist, but the most common are Dolby Digital and
DTS. The Dolby Digital and DTS standards both
require at least five speakers and a subwoofer.
■
DirectSound3D, a feature of DirectX 3, offered the
ability to place a sound anywhere in 3-D space.
DirectX 8.0 incorporated some EAX effects to add
universally accepted support for positional audio.

Installing Sound in a Windows System
■
Sound card installation can be divided into three
major steps: physical installation, device driver
installation, and configuration.
■
While the physical installation of a sound card is
straightforward, knowing where to plug in
multiple speakers can be a bit of a challenge.
■
It is preferable to use the driver that comes with
the sound card as opposed to the Windows built-in
drivers.
■
Look for configuration programs in two places: in
the Control Panel Sounds and Audio Devices
applet and in any proprietary applications that are
installed with the sound card.
Troubleshooting Sound
■
You can divide sound problems into three groups:
hardware, configuration, and application
problems.
■
The two first places to check when you suspect a
hardware problem are the volume controls and
speaker connectivity.
■
Configuration errors almost always take place at
installation of the sound card.
■
Application problems are often the most
challenging of all sound problems. Your best hope
is an error message; you can then check the
program’s Web site for help.

here are times when the walls close in, when you need a change of scenery
to get that elusive spark that inspires greatness…or sometimes you just
need to get away from your coworkers for a few hours because they’re driving
you nuts! For many occupations, that’s difficult to do. You’ve got to have
access to your documents and spreadsheets; you can’t function without e-mail
or the Internet. In short, you need a computer to get your job done.
Portable computing devices combine mobility with accessibility to bring
you the best of both worlds; put more simply, portables let you take some or
even all of your computing abilities with you when you go. Some portable
computers feature Windows XP systems with all the bells and whistles and all
your Microsoft Office apps for a seamless transition from desk to café table.
Even the smallest portable devices enable you to check your appointments and
address book, or play Solitaire during the endless wait at the doctor’s office.
This chapter takes an in-depth look at portables, first going through the major
variations you’ll run into and then hitting the tech-specific topics of enhancing,
upgrading, managing, and maintaining portable computers. Let’s get started!

■Portable Computing Devices
All portable devices share certain features. For output, they have LCD
screens, although these vary from 20-inch behemoths to microscopic 2-inch
screens. Portable computing devices employ sound of varying quality, from
simple beeps to fairly nice music reproductions. All of them run on DC elec-
tricity stored in batteries, although several different technologies offer a
range of battery life, lifespan, and cost. Other than screen, sound, and bat-
tery, portable computing devices come in an amazing variety of shapes,
sizes, and intended uses.
LCD Screens
Laptops come in a variety of sizes
and at varying costs. One major
contributor to the overall cost of a
laptop is the size of the LCD screen.
Most laptops offer a range between
12-inch to 17-inch screens (mea-
sured diagonally), while a few offer
just over 20-inch screens. Not only
are screens getting larger, but also
wider screens are becoming the sta-
tus quo. Many manufacturers are
phasing out the standard 4:3 aspect
ratio screen in favor of the widescreen format. Aspect ratio is the comparison of
the screen width to the screen height. Depending on screen resolution,
widescreens can have varying aspect ratios of 10:6, 16:9, 16:9.5, or 16:10. The
16:9 aspect ratio is the standard for widescreen movies while 16:10 is the stan-
dard for 17-inch LCD screens.
Laptop LCD screens come in a variety of supported resolutions, de-
scribed with acronyms such as XGA, WXGA, WSXGA, and more. The W in
front of the letters indicates widescreen. Table 14.1 lists commonly sup-
ported laptop display resolutions.

Cross Check
LCD Monitors
Stretching back to the early days of mobile computing, almost every
make and model of portable device has used an LCD monitor of some
shape or size. You know all about LCD monitors from the Essentials
course and Chapter 12, “Installing and Troubleshooting Video.” Every-
thing that applies to desktop LCDs applies to screens designed for por-
table devices as well, so cross check your knowledge. What are the
variations of LCD screen you’ll find today? Which technology offers the
best picture? What connectors do you find with LCDs? Are there any
special rules about cleaning LCD monitors? (Talk about a leading
question!)

If you look at the CompTIA A+
exam objectives for the Essen-
tials, IT Technician, and Depot
Technician exams, you’ll notice
that the objectives covered in this
chapter are, for all intents and
purposes, virtually the same for
each exam. CompTIA has not dif-
ferentiated the questions for each
exam covered by this domain, so
we have used the same chapter
for the Essentials and IT Techni-
cian exams.

Laptop screens come with two types of finish: matte and high gloss .
The matte finish was the industry standard for many years and offers a good
trade-off between richness of colors and reflection or glare. The better
screens have a wide viewing angle and decent response time. The major
drawback for matte-finished laptop screens is that they wash out a lot in
bright light. Using such a laptop at an outdoor café, for example, is almost
hopeless during daylight.
Manufacturers released high-gloss laptop screens in 2006, and they’ve
rapidly taken over many store shelves. The high-gloss finish offers sharper
contrast, richer colors, and wider viewing angles when compared to the
matte screens. Each manufacturer has a different name for high-gloss coat-
ings. Dell calls theirs TrueLife; Acer calls theirs CrystalBrite; and HP calls
theirs BrightView. The drawback to the high-gloss screens is that, contrary
to what the manufacturers’ claim, they pick up lots of reflection from nearby
objects, including the user! So while they’re usable outside during the day,
you’ll need to contend with increased reflection as well.
Desktop Replacements
When asked about portable computing devices, most folks describe the tra-
ditional clamshell laptop computer, such as the one in Figure 14.1, with
built-in LCD monitor, keyboard, and input device (a touchpad, in this case).
A typical laptop computer functions as a fully standalone PC, potentially
even replacing the desktop. The one in Figure 14.1, for example, has all of
the features you expect the modern PC to have, such as a fast CPU, lots of
RAM, a high-capacity hard drive, CD-RW and DVD drives, an excellent
sound system, and a functioning copy of Windows XP. Attach it to a

Tech Tip
What’s in a Name?
There’s no industry standard
naming for the vast majority of
styles of portable computing de-
vices, so manufacturers let their
marketing folks have fun with
naming. What’s the difference be-
tween a portable, a laptop, and a
notebook? Nothing. One manu-
facturer might call its four-pound
portable system with 12-inch
LCD a notebook, while another
manufacturer might call its much
larger desktop-replacement porta-
ble a notebook as well. A laptop
refers in general to the clamshell,
keyboard-on-the-bottom and
LCD-screen-at-the-top design
that is considered the shape of
mobile PCs.

network and you can browse the Internet and send e-mail. Considering it
weighs almost as much as a mini-tower PC (or at least it feels like it does
when I’m lugging it through the airport!), such a portable can be consid-
ered a desktop replacement , because it does everything that most people
want to do with a desktop PC and doesn’t compromise performance just to
make the laptop a few pounds lighter or the battery last an extra hour.
For input devices, desktop replacements (and other portables) used
trackballs in the early days, often plugged in like a mouse and clipped to the
side of the case. Other models with trackballs placed them in front of the
keyboard at the edge of the case nearest the user, or behind the keyboard at
the edge nearest the screen.
The next wave to hit the laptop market was IBM’s
TrackPoint device, a pencil eraser–sized joystick situated
in the center of the keyboard. The TrackPoint enables you
to move the pointer around without taking your fingers
away from the “home” typing position. You use a forefin-
ger to push the joystick around, and click or right-click us-
ing two buttons below the spacebar. This type of pointing
device has since been licensed for use by other manufac-
turers, and it continues to appear on laptops today.
But by far the most common laptop pointing device
found today is the
touchpad
(Figure 14.2)—a flat,
touch-sensitive pad just in front of the keyboard. To oper-
ate a touchpad, you simply glide your finger across its
surface to move the pointer, and tap the surface once or
twice to single- or double-click. You can also click using
buttons just below the pad. Most people get the hang of
this technique after just a few minutes of practice. The
main advantage of the touchpad over previous laptop
pointing devices is that it uses no moving parts—a fact
that can really extend the life of a hard-working laptop.
Some modern laptops actually provide
both a TrackPoint-type device and a
touchpad, to give the user a choice.
Desktop Extenders
Manufacturers offer
desktop extender
portable devices that don’t replace the
desktop, but rather extend it by giving
you a subset of features of the typical
desktop that you can take away from the
desk. Figure 14.3 shows a portable with a
good but small 13.3-inch-wide screen.
The system has 512 MB of RAM, a 2-GHz
processor, a 60-GB hard drive, and a bat-
tery that enables you to do work on it for
more than five hours while disconnected
from the wall socket. Even though it
plays music and has a couple of decent,
tiny speakers, you can’t game on this

computer (Solitaire, perhaps, but definitely not Half-Life 2!). But it weighs
only five pounds, nearly half the weight of the typical desktop replacement
portable.
Desktop extenders enable you to go mobile. When I’m on a roll writing,
for example, I don’t want to stop. But sometimes I do want to take a break
from the office and stroll over to my favorite café for a latté or a pint of fine
ale. At moments like these, I don’t need a fully featured laptop with a mon-
ster 15-inch or 17-inch screen, but just a good word processing system—and
perhaps the ability to surf the Internet on the café’s wireless network so I can
research other important topics once I finish my project for the day. A light-
weight laptop with a 12-inch or 13-inch screen, a reasonably fast processor,
and gobs of RAM does nicely.
PDAs
Having a few computing essentials on hand at all times eases the day and
makes planning and scheduling much more likely to succeed. Several com-
panies, such as Palm, Sony, Toshiba, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and Microsoft,
manufacture tiny handheld portable computing devices that hold data such
as your address book, personal notes, appointment schedules, and more.
Such machines are called personal digital assistants (PDAs) . All modern
PDAs have many applications, such as word processors for jotting
down notes or shopping lists, expense reports, and even image viewers.
Figure 14.4 shows a Palm Zire 71 PDA.
PDAs don’t run Windows XP or even 98, but rather require specialized
OSs such as Windows CE, PocketPC, PalmOS, and Linux. All of these OSs
provide a GUI that enables you to interact with the device by touching the
screen directly. Many of today’s PDAs use handwriting recognition combined
with modified mouse functions, usually in the form of a pen-like stylus to
make a type of input called pen-based computing . To make an application
load, for example, you would slide the stylus out of its holder in the PDA
case and touch the appropriate icon with the stylus tip.

Tech Tip
Spin the Weight
Manufacturers advertise the
weight of portable PCs, for the most
part, without the weight of the bat-
tery or the removable drives. Al-
though this deception is deplorable,
it’s pretty much universal in the
industry because no manufacturer
wants to be the first to say that
their desktop-replacement portable,
including battery and DVD-RW
drive, weighs 15 pounds when their
competitor advertises the same kind
of machine at 7.5 pounds! They’d
lose market share quickly.
When you shop or recommend
portable PCs, take the real weight
into consideration. By the time
you fill your laptop bag with a
power adapter, an external mouse,
a spare battery, and all the extra
accessories, you’ll definitely be
carrying more than the advertised
5–6 pounds.
Tech Tip
Ultralights
Ultralight portables are computers
that normally weigh less than three
pounds and are less than an inch in
thickness. These machines usually
have smaller displays, lower-
capacity hard drives, and CPUs
that operate at lower speeds than
their larger-sized brethren. This
class of portable computers is de-
signed for the busy traveler who
wants a nearly full-featured laptop
in a small, easily transported pack-
age. Often, these laptops are much
more expensive than larger, faster
machines—think of it as paying
more to get less! You’ll hear the
term subnotebooks used to de-
scribe ultralight portables; the
terms aren’t quite synonymous,
but the marketing waters for all
portable computing devices are
pretty muddy.
• Figure 14.4

HotSync
PDAs make excellent pocket companions because you can quickly add a cli-
ent’s address or telephone number, check the day’s schedule before going to
your next meeting, and modify your calendar entries when something unex-
pected arises. Best of all, you can then update all the equivalent features on
your desktop PC automatically! PDAs synchronize with your primary PC so
you have the same essential data on both machines. Many PDAs come with a
cradle, a place to rest your PDA and recharge its battery. The cradle connects
to the PC most often through a USB port. You can run special software to syn-
chronize the data between the PDA and the main PC. Setting up the Zire 71
featured previously, for example, requires you to install a portion of the Palm
desktop for Windows. This software handles all the synchronization chores.
You simply place the PDA in the properly connected cradle and click the
button to synchronize. Figure 14.5 shows a PDA in the middle of a HotSync
operation, PalmOS’s term for the process of synchronizing.
Beaming
Just about every PDA comes with an infrared port that enables you to trans-
fer data from one PDA to another, a process called beaming . For example,
you can readily exchange business information when at a conference or
swap pictures that you carry around in your PDA. The process is usually as
simple as clicking a drop-down list and selecting Beam or Beaming from the
menu. The PDA searches the nearby area—infrared has a very limited
range—to discover any PDA nearby. The receiving PDA flashes a message
to its owner asking permission to receive. Once that’s granted, you simply
stand there and wait for a moment while the PDAs transfer data. Slick!
PDA Memory
Almost every PDA has both internal flash ROM memory of 1 MB or more,
and some sort of removable and upgradeable storage medium. Secure
Digital (SD) technology has the strongest market share among the many
competing standards, but you’ll find a bunch of different memory card
types out there. SD cards come in a variety of physical sizes (SD, Mini SD,
and Micro SD) and fit in a special SD slot. Other popular media include
CompactFlash (CF) cards and Sony’s proprietary Memory Stick. You’ll find
capacities for all the standards ranging from 128 MB up to 8 GB—on a card
the size of a postage stamp! Figure 14.6 shows some typical memory cards.

Memory Cards
Memory cards of all stripes made
the leap in 2003 from the exclu-
sive realm of tiny devices such as
PDAs and digital photographic
cameras to full-featured portable
PCs and even desktop models.
Some Panasonic PCs sport SD
card slots, for example, and you
can expect nearly every Sony
PC—portable or otherwise—
made in 2003 and later to offer a
Memory Stick port.

Tablet PCs
Tablet PCs combine the handwriting benefits of PDAs with the full-fledged
power of a traditional portable PC to create a machine that perfectly meets
the needs of many professions. Unlike PDAs, tablet PCs use a full-featured
PC operating system such as Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition
2005. Instead of (or in addition to) a keyboard and mouse, tablet PCs pro-
vide a screen that doubles as an input device. With a special pen, called a
stylus, you can actually write on the screen (Figure 14.7). Just make sure you
don’t grab your fancy Cross ball-point pen accidentally and start writing on
the screen! Unlike many PDA screens, most tablet PC screens are not pres-
sure sensitive—you have to use the stylus to write on the screen. Tablet PCs
come in two main form factors: convertibles, which include a keyboard that
can be folded out of the way, and slates, which do away with the keyboard
entirely. The convertible tablet PC in Figure 14.7, for example, looks and
functions just like the typical clamshell laptop shown back in Figure 14.1.
But here it’s shown with the screen rotated 180 degrees and snapped flat so
it functions as a slate. Pretty slick!
In applications that aren’t “tablet-aware,” the stylus acts just like a
mouse, enabling you to select items, double-click, right-click, and so on. To
input text with the stylus, you can either tap keys on a virtual keyboard
(shown in Figure 14.8), write in the writing utility (shown in Figure 14.9), or
use speech recognition software. With a little practice, most users will find
the computer’s accuracy in recognizing their handwriting to be sufficient
for most text input, although speedy touch-typists will probably still want
to use a keyboard when typing longer documents.
Tablet PCs work well when you have limited space or have to walk
around and use a laptop. Anyone who has ever tried to type with one hand,
while walking around the factory floor holding the laptop with the other
hand, will immediately appreciate the beauty of a tablet PC. In this scenario,
tablet PCs are most effective when combined with applications designed to

be used with a stylus instead of a keyboard. An inventory control program,
for example, might present drop-down lists and radio buttons to the user,
making a stylus the perfect input tool. With the right custom application,
tablet PCs become an indispensable tool.
Microsoft encourages software developers to take advantage of a fea-
ture they call digital ink, which allows applications to accept pen strokes as
input without first converting the pen strokes into text or mouse-clicks.
Microsoft Journal (Figure 14.10), which comes with Windows-based tablet
PCs, allows you to write on the screen just as though you were writing on a

ing Microsoft Office, allow users to add ink annota-
tions. Imagine sitting on an airplane reviewing a
Microsoft Word document and simply scribbling
your comments on the screen (Figure 14.11). No
more printing out hard copy and breaking out the
red pen for me! Imagine running a PowerPoint pre-
sentation and being able to annotate your presenta-
tion as you go. In the future, look for more
applications to support Microsoft’s digital ink.
There are many useful third-party applications
designed specifically to take advantage of the tablet
PC form factor. In fields such as law and medicine
where tablet PCs have been especially popular, the
choices are endless. One handy free utility that

■Enhance and Upgrade the
Portable PC
In the dark ages of mobile computing, you had to shell out top dollar for any
device that would unplug, and what you purchased was what you got. Up-
grade a laptop? Add functions to your desktop replacement? You had few if
any options, so you simply paid for a device that would be way behind the
technology curve within a year and functionally obsolete within two.
Portable PCs today offer many ways to enhance their capabilities. Internal
and external expansion buses enable you to add completely new functions to
portables, such as attaching a scanner or mobile printer or both! You can take
advantage of the latest wireless technology breakthrough simply by slipping
a card into the appropriate slot on the laptop. Further, modern portables offer
a modular interior. You can add or change RAM, for example— the first up-
grade that almost every laptop owner wants to make. You can increase the
hard drive storage space and, at least with some models, swap out the CPU,
video card, sound card, and more. Gone forever are the days of buying guar-
anteed obsolescence! Let’s look at four specific areas of technology that
laptops use to enhance functions and upgrade components: PC Cards, single-
and multiple-function expansion ports, and modular components.

PC Cards
The Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) es-
tablishes standards involving portable computers, especially when it comes
to expansion cards, which are generically called PC Cards. PC Cards are
roughly credit card–sized devices that enhance and extend the functions
of a portable PC. PC Cards are as standard on today’s mobile computers
as the hard drive. PC Cards are easy to use, inexpensive, and convenient.
Figure 14.12 shows a typical PC Card.
Almost every portable PC has one or two PC Card slots, into which you
insert a PC Card. Each card will have at least one function, but many have
two, three, or more! You can buy a PC Card that offers connections for re-
movable media, for example, such as combination SD and CF card readers.
You can also find PC Cards that enable you to plug into multiple types of
networks. All PC Cards are hot-swappable, meaning you can plug them in
without powering down the PC.
The PCMCIA has established two versions of PC Cards, one
using a parallel bus and the other using a serial bus. Each version,
in turn, offers two technology variations as well as several physical
varieties. This might sound complicated at first, but here’s the map
to sort it all out.
Parallel PC Cards
Parallel PC Cards come in two flavors, 16-bit and CardBus , and
each flavor comes in three different physical sizes, called Type I,
Type II, and Type III. The 16-bit PC Cards, as the name suggests,
are 16-bit, 5-V cards that can have up to two distinct functions or
devices, such as a modem/network card combination. CardBus
PC Cards are 32-bit, 3.3-V cards that can have up to eight (!) differ-
ent functions on a single card. Regular PC Cards will fit into and
work in CardBus slots, but the reverse is not true. CardBus totally
dominates the current PC Card landscape, but you might still run
into older 16-bit PC Cards.
Type I, II, and III cards differ only in the thickness of the card
(Type I being the thinnest, and Type III the thickest). All PC Cards
share the same 68-pin interface, so any PC Card will
work in any slot that’s high enough to accept that
card type. Type II cards are by far the most common
of PC Cards. Therefore, most laptops will have two
Type II slots, one above the other, to enable the com-
puter to accept two Type I or II cards or one Type III
card (Figure 14.13).
Although PCMCIA doesn’t require that certain
sizes perform certain functions, most PC Cards fol-
low their recommendations. Table 14.3 lists the sizes
and typical uses of each type of PC Card.
ExpressCard
ExpressCard , the high-performance serial version of
the PC Card, has begun to replace PC Card slots on
Chapter 14: Portable Computing
287
CompTIA uses the older term
PCMCIA cards to describe PC
Cards. Don’t be shocked if you
get that as an option on your ex-
ams! You’ll hear many techs use
the phrase as well, though the
PCMCIA trade group has not
used it for many years.

Many manufacturers use the
term hot-pluggable rather than
hot-swappable to describe the
ability to plug in and replace PC
Cards on the fly. Look for either
term on the exams.

newer laptop PCs. While ExpressCard offers significant performance bene-
fits, keep in mind that ExpressCard and PC Cards are incompatible. You
cannot use your PC Card in your new laptop’s ExpressCard socket. The PC
Card has had a remarkably long life in portable PCs, and you can still find it
on some new laptops, but get ready to replace all your PC Card devices.
ExpressCard comes in two widths: 54 mm and 34 mm. Figure 14.14 shows a
34-mm ExpressCard. Both cards are 75-mm long and 5-mm thick, which
makes them shorter than all previous PC Cards and the same thickness as a
Type II PC Card.
ExpressCards connect to either the Hi-Speed USB 2.0 bus or a PCI Ex-
press bus. These differ phenomenally in speed. The amazingly slow-in-
comparison USB version has a maximum throughput of 480 Mbps. The PCIe
version, in contrast, roars in at 2.5 Gbps in unidirectional communication.
Woot!
Table 14.4 shows the throughput and
variations for the parallel and serial PC
Cards currently or soon to be on the market.
Software Support for PC Cards
The PCMCIA standard defines two levels
of software drivers to support PC Cards.
The first, lower level is known as socket
services . Socket services are device drivers
that support the PC Card socket, enabling
the system to detect when a PC Card has
been inserted or removed, and providing
the necessary I/O to the device. The sec-
ond, higher level is known as card services .
The card services level recognizes the

Tech Tip
Keeping Your PC
Cards Healthy
Most PC Cards normally come
with a hard plastic storage case.
Always be sure to use this case to
store the cards when you’re not
using them. If dust, dirt, or grime
gets into the array of contacts at
the end of the card, the card won’t
work when you try to use it next.
Also, be careful when using PC
Cards that extend out of the PC
Card slot past the edge of your
laptop. One dark night I set my
laptop on the floor with a PC
Card NIC sticking out of it while
I went to get a drink of water. On
my way back, I accidentally
stepped on the card sticking out
of my laptop and nearly snapped
it in half. Luckily, my laptop
wasn’t damaged, but the card
was toast!

function of a particular PC Card and provides the specialized drivers
necessary to make the card work.
In today’s laptops, the socket services are standardized and are handled
by the system BIOS. Windows itself handles all card services and has a large
preinstalled base of PC Card device drivers, although most PC Cards come
with their own drivers.
Limited-Function Ports
All portable PCs and many PDAs come with one or more single-function
ports, such as an analog VGA connection for hooking up an external moni-
tor and a PS/2 port for a keyboard or mouse. Note that contrary to the setup
on desktop PCs, the single PS/2 port on most laptops supports both key-
boards and pointing devices. Most portable computing devices have a
speaker port, and this includes modern PDAs. My Compaq iPAQ doubles
as an excellent MP3 player, by the way, a feature now included with most
PDAs. Some portables have line-in and microphone jacks as well. Finally,
most current portable PCs come with built-in NICs or modems for network-
ing support. (See the section “The Modular Laptop” later in this chapter for
more on networking capabilities.)
All limited-function ports work the same way on portable PCs as they
do on desktop models. You plug in a device to a particular port and, as long
as Windows has the proper drivers, you will have a functioning device
when you boot. The only port that requires any extra effort is the video port.
Most laptops support a second monitor via an analog VGA port or a dig-
ital DVI port in the back of the box. With a second monitor attached, you can
display Windows on only the laptop LCD, only the external monitor, or
both simultaneously. Not all portables can do all variations, but they’re
more common than not. Most portables have a special Function (FN) key on
the keyboard that, when pressed, adds an ad-
ditional option to certain keys on the key-
board. Figure 14.15 shows a close-up of a
typical keyboard with the Function key; note
the other options that can be accessed with the
Function key such as indicated on the F5 key.
To engage the second monitor or to cycle
through the modes, hold the Function key
and press F5.
General-Purpose Ports
Sometimes the laptop doesn’t come with all of
the hardware you want. Today’s laptops usu-
ally include several USB ports and a selection
of the legacy general-purpose expansion
ports (PS/2, RS-232 serial ports, and so on) for
installing
peripheral hardware. If you’re
lucky, you might even get a FireWire port so
you can plug in your fancy new digital video
camera. If you’re really lucky, you might even

ExpressCards don’t require
either socket or card services, at
least not in the way PC Cards do.
The ExpressCard modules auto-
matically configure the software
on your computer, which makes
them truly plug and play.
Although many laptops use
the Function key method to
cycle the monitor selections,
that’s not always the case. You
might have to pop into the Dis-
play applet in the Control Panel
to click a checkbox. Just be as-
sured that if the laptop has a
VGA or DVI port, you can cycle
through monitor choices!

USB and FireWire
Universal serial bus (USB) and
FireWire (or more properly, IEEE
1394) are two technologies that have their roots in desktop computer tech-
nology, but have also found widespread use in portable PCs. Both types of
connections feature an easy-to-use connector and give the user the ability to
insert a device into a system while the PC is running—you won’t have to re-
boot a system in order to install a new peripheral. With USB and FireWire,
just plug the device in and go! Because portable PCs don’t have multiple in-
ternal expansion capabilities like desktops, USB and FireWire are two
of the more popular methods for attaching peripherals to laptops (see
Figure 14.16).
Port Replicators
A port replicator plugs into a single port on the portable computer— often a
USB port, but sometimes a proprietary port—and offers common PC ports,
such as serial, parallel, USB, network, and PS/2. By plugging the port
replicator into your notebook computer, you can instantly connect it to
non-portable components such as a printer, scanner, monitor, or a full-sized
keyboard. Port replicators are typically used at home or in the office with the
non-portable equipment already connected. Figure 14.17 shows an Dell
Inspiron laptop connected to a port replicator.
Once connected to the port replicator, the computer can access any de-
vices attached to it; there’s no need to connect each individual device to
the PC. As a side bonus, port replicators enable you to attach legacy de-
vices, such as parallel printers, to a new laptop that only has modern

turers have proprietary connec-
tions for proprietary port
replicators. As long as such a
portable PC has a USB port, you
can use either the proprietary
hardware or the more flexible
USB devices.

multifunction ports such as USB and FireWire, and not
parallel or serial ports.
Docking Stations
Docking stations
(see Figure 14.18) resemble port
replicators in many ways, offering legacy and modern
single-function and multifunction ports. The typical
docking station uses a proprietary connection, but has
extra features built in, such as a DVD drive or PC Card
slot for extra enhancements. You can find docking sta-
tions for most laptop models, but you’ll find them used
most frequently with the desktop extender and
ultralight models. Many ultralights have no internal
CD or DVD media drive (because the drives weigh too
much), and so must rely on external drives for full PC
functionality. Docking stations make an excellent com-
panion to such portables.
The Modular Laptop
For years, portable PC makers required completely proprietary components
for each system model they developed. For the most part, this proprietary
attitude still prevails, but manufacturers have added some modularity to
today’s portable PCs, enabling you to make basic replacements and up-
grades without going back to the manufacturer for expensive, proprietary
components. You need to surf the Web for companies that sell the compo-
nents, because very few storefronts stock them. The most common modular
components are RAM, hard drives, CPUs, video cards, optical drives, and
network cards.
RAM
Stock factory portable PCs almost always come with a minimal amount of
RAM, so one of the first laptop upgrades you’ll be called on to do is to add
more RAM. Economy laptops running Windows XP Home routinely sit on

store shelves and go home to consumers with as little 256 MB of RAM, an
amount guaranteed to limit the use and performance of the laptop. The OS
alone will consume more than half of the RAM! Luckily, every decent laptop
has upgradeable RAM slots. Laptops use one of four types of RAM. Most
older laptops use either 72-pin or 144-pin SO-DIMMs with SDRAM
technology (Figure 14.19). DDR and DDR2 systems primarily use 200-pin
SO-DIMMs although some laptops use micro-DIMMs.
How to Add or Replace RAM
Upgrading the RAM in a portable PC requires
a couple of steps. First, you need to get the correct RAM. Many older portable
PCs use proprietary RAM solutions, which
means you need to order directly from
Dell, HP, or Sony and pay exorbitant prices
for the precious extra megabytes. Most
manufacturers
have
taken
pity
on
consumers
in
recent
years
and
use
standard SO-DIMMs or micro-DIMMs.
Refer to the manufacturer’s Web site or to
the manual (if any) that came with the
portable for the specific RAM needed.
Second, every portable PC offers a
unique challenge to the tech who wants
to upgrade the RAM because there’s
no standard for RAM placement in
portables. More often than not, you need
to unscrew or pop open a panel on the un-
derside of the portable (Figure 14.20).
Then you press out on the restraining
clips and the RAM stick will pop up
(Figure 14.21). Gently remove the old
stick of RAM and insert the new one by
reversing the steps.

Cross Check
How Much RAM is Enough?
The amount of RAM needed to run a PC—portable or otherwise—
smoothly and stably depends on both the type of applications that it will
run and the needs of the OS. When making a recommendation to a client
about upgrading a laptop’s memory, you should ask the basic questions,
such as what he or she plans to do on the laptop. If the laptop will be used
for e-mail, word processing, and Web surfing, a medium level of RAM,
such as 256 MB, might be adequate. If the user travels, uses a high-end
digital camera, and wants to use Photoshop to edit huge images, you’ll
need to augment the RAM accordingly. Then you need to add the needs
of the OS to give a good recommendation. Cross check your knowledge
from the Essentials course about specific OS RAM needs. What’s a good
minimum for Windows 2000? What about Windows XP Professional?

Shared Memory
Some laptops (and desktops) support shared memory .
Shared memory is a means of reducing the cost of video cards by reducing
the amount of memory on the video card itself. Instead of a video card with
256 MB of RAM, it might have only 64 MB of RAM but can borrow 192 MB
of RAM from the system. This equates to a 256-MB video card. The video
card uses regular system RAM to make up for the loss.
The obvious benefit of shared memory is a less expensive video card
with performance comparable to its mega-memory alternative. The down-
side is your overall system performance will suffer because a portion of the
system RAM is no longer available to programs. (The term shared is a bit
misleading because the video card takes control of a portion of RAM. The
video portion of system RAM is not shared back and forth between the
video card processor and the CPU.) Shared memory technologies include
TurboCache (developed by NVIDIA) and HyperMemory (developed by
ATI).
Some systems give you control over the amount of shared memory
while others simply allow you to turn shared memory on or off. The settings
are found in CMOS setup and only on systems that support shared memory.
Shared memory is not reported to Windows so don’t panic if you’ve got
1 GB of RAM in your laptop, but Windows only sees 924 MB⎯the missing
memory is used for video!
Adding more system RAM to a laptop with shared memory will im-
prove laptop performance. Although it might appear to improve video per-
formance, that doesn’t tell the true story. It’ll improve overall performance
because the OS and CPU get more RAM to work with. On some laptops, you
can improve video performance as well, but that depends on the CMOS
setup. If the shared memory is not set to maximum by default, increasing
the overall memory and upping the portion reserved for video will improve
video performance specifically.

Hard Drives
ATA drives in the 2.5-inch drive format now
rule in all laptops. Although much smaller than
regular ATA drives, they still use all the same
features and configurations. These smaller hard
drives have suffered, however, from dimin-
ished
storage
capacity
compared
to
their
3.5-inch brothers. Currently, large 2.5-inch hard
drives hold up to 120 GB, while the 3.5-inch
hard drives can hold more than 750 GB of data!
Some manufacturers may require you to set the
drive to use a cable select setting as opposed to
master or slave, so check with the laptop maker
for any special issues. Otherwise, no difference
exists between 2.5-inch drives and their larger
3.5-inch brethren (Figure 14.22).
Modular CPUs
Both AMD and Intel make specialized CPUs for laptops that produce less
heat and consume less power, yet only now are folks realizing that they can
easily upgrade many systems by removing the old CPU and replacing it
with a new one. Be very careful to follow manufacturer’s specifications! You
should keep in mind, however, that replacing the CPU in a laptop often re-
quires that you disassemble the entire machine. This can be a daunting task,
even for professionals. If you want to upgrade the CPU in your laptop, it’s
often best to let the professionals take care of it.
Video Cards
Some video card makers make modular video cards for laptops. Although
no single standard works in all systems, a quick phone call to the tech sup-
port department of the laptop maker often reveals upgrade options (if any).
Modular video cards are the least standardized of all modular components,
but as manufacturers adopt more industry-wide standards, we’ll be able to
replace video cards in laptops more readily.
Modular Drives
In order to add functionality to laptops, manufacturers include “modular
drives” with their machines. CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, CD-R/RW, and
CD-RW/DVD-ROM drives are the most common modular drives that are
included with portables. The beauty of modular drives is that you can swap
easily back and forth between different types of drives. Need more storage
space? Pull out the CD-ROM drive and put in another hard drive. Many
laptops enable you to replace a drive with a second battery, which obvi-
ously can extend the time you can go before you have to plug the laptop into
an AC outlet.
I have a laptop that allows me to swap out my CD-ROM drive for a
second battery. If I don’t need to access any CDs and don’t need super-
extended battery life, I just take out the component that’s currently installed

Tech Tip
Going Inside
To reach most modular compo-
nents on a laptop, you need to do
more than remove an exterior
panel. You need to go inside to
get access to devices directly con-
nected to the motherboard. Many
laptops have an easily removable
keyboard that, once removed,
gives you access to a metal heat
spreader (just a plate that sits
over the motherboard) and a
half-dozen or more tiny screws.
You’ll need a special screwdriver
to avoid stripping the screws—
check a watch or eyeglass shop if
your local hardware store doesn’t
carry anything appropriate.
You need to take major precau-
tions when you remove the key-
board and heat spreader. The
keyboard will be attached to a
small cable that can easily discon-
nect if you pull hard. Don’t forget
to check this connection before
you reinsert the keyboard at the
end of the procedure! Avoid ESD
like you would with any other
PC, and definitely unplug the
laptop from the wall and remove
the battery before you do any
work inside!

and put a blank faceplate into the empty slot. Traveling with an empty bay
makes my hefty laptop weigh a little bit less, and every little bit helps!
Most modular drives are truly hot-swappable, enabling
you to remove and insert devices without any special soft-
ware. Many still require you to use the Hardware Removal
Tool (also known as Safely Remove Hardware) located in the
system tray or notification area (Figure 14.23). When in doubt,
always remove modular devices using this tool. Figure 14.24
shows the Safely Remove Hardware dialog box. To remove a
device, highlight it and click the Stop button. Windows will
shut down the device and tell you when it’s safe to remove the device.
Mobile NICs and Mini PCI
Every laptop made in the last few years comes with networking capabilities
built in. They have modems for dial-up and Ethernet
ports for plugging into a wired network. Because they
run Windows, OS X, or some Linux distro, laptops have
all the networking software ready to go, just like their
desk-bound cousins.
Many laptops now come with integrated wireless
networking support by way of a built-in Wi-Fi adapter
usually installed in a Mini PCI slot on the laptop mother-
board. The Mini PCI bus is an adaptation of the standard
PCI bus and was developed specifically for integrated
communications peripherals such as modems and net-
work adapters. Built-in networking support means you
don’t need an additional PC Card to provide a network
adapter. The Mini PCI bus also provides support for
other integrated devices such as Bluetooth, modems, au-
dio, or hard drive controllers. One great aspect of Mini
PCI is that if some new technology eclipses the current
wireless technology or some other technology that uses
the bus, you can upgrade by swapping a card.
Officially released in 1999, Mini PCI is a 32-bit
33-MHz bus and is basically PCI v2.2 with a different
form factor. Like PCI, it supports bus mastering and
DMA. Mini PCI cards are about a quarter the size of a regular PCI card and
can be as small as 2.75 inches by 1.81 inches by .22 inches. They can be found
in small products such as laptops, printers, and set-top boxes.
To extend battery life, built-in communication devices such as Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth adapters can be toggled on and off without powering down the
computer. Many laptops come with a physical switch along the front or side
edge allowing you to power on or off the communications adapter. Simi-
larly, you can often use a keyboard shortcut for this, generally by pressing
the Function (FN) key along with some other key. The FN key, when pressed,
allows other keys to accomplish specific tasks. For example, on my laptop
pressing FN-F2 toggles my Wi-Fi adapter on and off; pressing FN-F10 ejects
my CD-ROM drive.

A typical reason to upgrade a

cess to improved security op-
tions such as better encryption.

■Managing and Maintaining
Portable Computers
Most portable PCs come from the factory solidly built and configured. Man-
ufacturers know that few techs outside their factories know enough to work
on them, so they don’t cut corners. From a tech’s standpoint, your most com-
mon work on managing and maintaining portables involves taking care of
the batteries and extending the battery life through proper power manage-
ment, keeping the machine clean, and avoiding excessive heat.
Everything you normally do to maintain a PC applies to portable PCs.
You need to keep current on Windows patches and Service Packs, and use
stable, recent drivers. Run Check Disk with some frequency, and definitely
defragment the hard drive. Disk Cleanup is a must if the laptop runs Win-
dows XP. That said, let’s look at issues specifically involving portables.
Batteries
Manufacturers use three different types of batteries for portable PCs and
each battery type has its own special needs and quirks. Once you’ve got a
clear understanding of the quirks, you can usually spot and fix battery prob-
lems. The three types of batteries commonly used in mobile PCs are
Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd) , Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) , and Lithium-Ion
(Li-Ion) batteries. Manufacturers have also started working with fuel cell
batteries, although most of that work is experimental at this writing.
Nickel-Cadmium
Ni-Cds were the first batteries commonly used in mobile PCs, which means
the technology was full of little problems. Probably most irritating was a lit-
tle thing called battery memory , or the tendency of a Ni-Cd battery to lose a
significant amount of its rechargeability if it was charged repeatedly with-
out being totally discharged. A battery that originally kept a laptop running
for two hours would eventually only keep that same
laptop going for 30 minutes or less. Figure 14.25 shows
a typical Ni-Cd battery.
To prevent memory problems, a Ni-Cd battery had
to be discharged completely before each recharging.
Recharging was tricky as well, because Ni-Cd batteries
disliked being overcharged. Unfortunately, there was
no way to verify when a battery was fully charged
without an expensive charging machine, which none of
us had. As a result, most Ni-Cd batteries lasted an ex-
tremely short time and had to be replaced. A quick fix
was to purchase a conditioning charger . These chargers
would first totally discharge the Ni-Cd battery, and
then generate a special “reverse” current that, in a way,
“cleaned” internal parts of the battery so that it could
be recharged more often and would run longer on each
recharge. Ni-Cd batteries would, at best, last for 1000
charges, and far fewer with poor treatment. Ni-Cds

• Figure 14.25
Ni-Cd battery

were extremely susceptible to heat and would self-discharge over time if not
used. Leaving a Ni-Cd in the car in the summer was guaranteed to result in a
fully discharged battery in next to no time!
But Ni-Cd batteries didn’t stop causing trouble after they died. The
highly toxic metals inside the battery made it unacceptable simply to
throw them in the trash. Ni-Cd batteries should be disposed of via special-
ized disposal companies. This is very important! Even though Ni-Cd bat-
teries aren’t used in PCs very often anymore, many devices, such as
cellular and cordless phones, still use Ni-Cd batteries. Don’t trash the envi-
ronment by tossing Ni-Cds in a landfill. Turn them in at the closest special
disposal site; most recycling centers are glad to take them. Also, many bat-
tery manufacturers/distributors will take them. The environment you
help preserve just might be yours—or your kids’!
Nickel-Metal Hydride
Ni-MH batteries were the next generation of mobile PC batteries and are
still quite common today. Basically, Ni-MH batteries are Ni-Cd batteries
without most of the headaches. Ni-MH batteries are much less sus-
ceptible to memory problems, can better tolerate overcharging, can
take more recharging, and last longer between rechargings. Like
Ni-Cds, Ni-MH batteries are still susceptible to heat, but at least they
are considered less toxic to the environment. It’s still a good idea to
do a special disposal. Unlike a Ni-Cd, it’s usually better to recharge a
Ni-MH with shallow recharges as opposed to a complete discharge/
recharge. Ni-MH is a popular replacement battery for Ni-Cd systems
(Figure 14.26).
Lithium Ion
The most common type battery used today is Li-Ion. Li-Ion batteries
are very powerful, completely immune to memory problems, and
last at least twice as long as comparable Ni-MH batteries on one
charge. Sadly, they can’t handle as many charges as Ni-MH types,
but today’s users are usually more than glad to give up total battery
lifespan in return for longer periods between charges. Li-Ion batter-
ies will explode if they are overcharged, so all Li-Ion batteries sold
with PCs have built-in circuitry to prevent accidental overcharging.
Lithium batteries can only be used on systems designed to use them.
They can’t be used as replacement batteries (Figure 14.27).
Other Portable Power Sources
In an attempt to provide better maintenance for laptop batteries,
manufacturers have developed a new type of battery called the
smart battery . Smart batteries tell the computer when they need
to be charged, conditioned, or replaced.
Portable computer manufacturers are also looking at other
potential power sources, especially ones that don’t have the
shortcomings of current batteries. The most promising of these
new technologies is fuel cells . The technology behind fuel cells
is very complex, but to summarize, fuel cells produce electrical
power as a result of a chemical reaction between the hydrogen

You must use disposal com-
panies or battery recycling ser-
vices to dispose of the highly
toxic Ni-Cd batteries.

and oxygen contained in the fuel cell. It is estimated that a small fuel cell
could power a laptop for up to 40 hours before it needs to be replaced or re-
filled. This technology is still a year or two from making it to the consumer
market, but it’s an exciting trend!
The Care and Feeding of
Batteries
In general, keep in mind the fol-
lowing basics. First, always store
batteries in a cool place. Al-
though a freezer is in concept an
excellent storage place, the mois-
ture, metal racks, and food make
it a bad idea. Second, condition
your Ni-Cd and Ni-MH batteries
by using a charger that also con-
ditions the battery; they’ll last
longer. Third, keep battery con-
tacts clean with a little alcohol or
just a dry cloth. Fourth, never
handle a battery that has rup-
tured or broken; battery chemi-
cals are very dangerous. Finally,
always recycle old batteries.
Power Management
Many different parts are included in the typical laptop, and each part uses
power. The problem with early laptops was that every one of these parts
used power continuously, whether or not the system needed that device at
that time. For example, the hard drive would continue to spin whether or
not it was being accessed, and the LCD panel would continue to display,
even when the user walked away from the machine.
The optimal situation would be a system where the user could instruct the
PC to shut down unused devices selectively, preferably by defining a maxi-
mum period of inactivity that, when reached, would trigger the PC to shut
down the inactive device. Longer periods of inactivity would eventually enable
the entire system to shut itself down, leaving critical information loaded in
RAM, ready to restart if a wake-up event (such as moving the mouse or press-
ing a key) would tell the system to restart. The system would have to be sensi-
tive to potential hazards, such as shutting down in the middle of writing to a
drive, and so on. Also, this feature could not add significantly to the cost of the
PC. Clearly, a machine that could perform these functions would need special-
ized hardware, BIOS, and operating system to operate properly. This process
of cooperation among the hardware, the BIOS, and the OS to reduce power
use is known generically as power management.
System Management Mode (SMM)
Intel began the process of power management with a series of new features
built into the 386SX CPU. These new features enabled the CPU to slow down or

Recycling Old Portable PC Batteries
Got an old portable PC battery lying around? Well, you’ve got to get rid
of it, and since there are some pretty nasty chemicals in that battery, you
can’t just throw it in the trash. Sooner or later, you’ll probably need to
deal with such a battery, so try this:
1.
Do an online search to find the battery recycling center nearest
to you.
2.
Sometimes, you can take old laptop batteries to an auto parts
store that disposes of old car batteries—I know it sounds odd,
but it’s true! See if you can find one in your area that will do
this.

Many cities offer a hazardous materials disposal or recycling
service. Check to see if and how your local government will help
you dispose of your old batteries.

stop its clock without erasing the register information, as well as enabling
power saving in peripherals. These features were collectively called System
Management Mode (SMM) . All modern CPUs have SMM. Although a
power-saving CPU was okay, power management was relegated to special
“sleep” or “doze” buttons that would stop the CPU and all of the peripherals
on the laptop. To take real advantage of SMM, the system needed a specialized
BIOS and OS to go with the SMM CPU. To this end, Intel put forward the Ad-
vanced Power Management (APM) specification in 1992 and the Advanced Con-
figuration and Power Interface (ACPI) standard in 1996.
Requirements for APM/ACPI
APM and ACPI require a number of items in order to function fully. First is
an SMM-capable CPU. As virtually all CPUs are SMM-capable, this is easy.
Second is an APM-compliant BIOS, which enables the CPU to shut off the
peripherals when desired. The third requirement is devices that will accept
being shut off. These devices are usually called “Energy Star” devices,
which signals their compliance with the EPA’s Energy Star standard. To be
an Energy Star device, a peripheral must have the ability to shut down with-
out actually turning off and show that they use much less power than the
non–Energy Star equivalent. Last, the system’s OS must know how to re-
quest that a particular device be shut down, and the CPU’s clock must be
slowed down or stopped.
ACPI goes beyond the APM standard by supplying support for
hot-swappable devices—always a huge problem with APM. This feature
aside, it is a challenge to tell the difference between an APM system and an
ACPI system at first glance.
APM/ACPI Levels
APM defines four different power-usage operating levels for a system.
These levels are intentionally fuzzy to give manufacturers considerable lee-
way in their use; the only real difference among them is the amount of time
each takes to return to normal usage. These levels are as follows:
■
Full On
Everything in the system is running at full power. There is
no power management.
■
APM Enabled
CPU and RAM are running at full power. Power
management is enabled. An unused device may or may not be shut
down.
■
APM Standby
CPU is stopped. RAM still stores all programs. All
peripherals are shut down, although configuration options are still
stored. (In other words, to get back to APM Enabled, you won’t have
to reinitialize the devices.)
■
APM Suspend
Everything in the PC is shut down or at its lowest
power-consumption setting. Many systems use a special type of
Suspend called hibernation , where critical configuration information
is written to the hard drive. Upon a wake-up event, the system is
reinitialized, and the data is read from the drive to return the system
to the APM Enabled mode. Clearly, the recovery time between
Suspend and Enabled will be much longer than the time between
Standby and Enabled.
Chapter 14: Portable Computing
299
Don’t limit your perception of
APM, ACPI, and Energy Star just
to laptops! Virtually all desktop
systems also use the power
management functions.

ACPI handles all these levels plus a few more, such as “soft power
on/off,” which enables you to define the function of the power button.
Configuration of APM/ACPI
You configure APM/ACPI via CMOS settings or through Windows. Win-
dows settings will override CMOS settings. Although the APM/ACPI stan-
dards permit a great deal of flexibility, which can create some confusion
among different implementations,
certain settings apply generally to
CMOS configuration. First is the
ability to initialize power manage-
ment; this enables the system to en-
ter the APM Enabled mode. Often
CMOS
will
then
present
time
frames for entering Standby and
Suspend mode, as well as settings
to determine which events take
place in each of these modes. Also,
many CMOS versions will present
settings
to
determine
wake-up
events, such as directing the sys-
tem to monitor a modem or a par-
ticular IRQ (Figure 14.28). A true
ACPI-compliant CMOS provides
an ACPI setup option. Figure 14.29
shows a typical modern BIOS that
provides this setting.
APM/ACPI settings can be found in the Windows 2000/XP control
panel applet Power Options. The Power Options applet has several built-in
power schemes such as Home/Office and Max Battery that put the system
into standby or suspend after a certain interval (Figure 14.30). You can also
require the system to go into standby after a set period of time or turn off the
monitor or hard drive after a time, thus creating your own custom power
scheme.
Another feature, Hibernate mode,
takes everything in active memory and
stores it on the hard drive just before
the system powers down. When the PC
comes out of hibernation, Windows
reloads all the files and applications into
RAM. Figure 14.31 shows the Power Op-
tions Properties applet in Windows XP.

more abuse than a corresponding desk-

radically shorten the life of a porta-
ble if you don’t take action. One of
the most important things you
should do is clean the laptop regu-
larly. Use an appropriate screen
cleaner (not a glass cleaner!) to re-
move fingerprints and dust from
the fragile LCD panel. (Refer to
Chapter 12 for specifics.)
If you’ve had the laptop in a
smoky or dusty environment where
the air quality alone causes prob-
lems, try compressed air for clean-
ing. Compressed air works great for
blowing out the dust and crumbs
from the keyboard and for keeping PC Card sockets clear. Don’t use water
on your keyboard! Even a minor amount of moisture inside the portable can
toast a component.
Heat
To manage and maintain a healthy portable PC, you need to deal with issues
of heat. Every portable has a stack of electronic components crammed into a
very small space. Unlike their desktop brethren, portables don’t have lots of
freely-moving air space that enables fans to cool everything down. Even
with lots of low-power-consumption devices inside, portable PCs still crank
out a good deal of heat. Excessive heat can cause system lockups and

Adjusting Your System’s Power Management
Go into the Power Options applet and take a look at the various settings.
What is the current power scheme for your computer? If you’re using a
laptop, is your system still using the Home/Office Desktop power
scheme? If this is the case, go ahead and change the power scheme to
Portable/Laptop.
Try changing the individual settings for each power scheme. For in-
stance, set a new value for the System Standby setting—try making
your computer go into standby after five minutes. Don’t worry, you
aren’t going to hurt anything if you fiddle with these settings.

hardware failures, so you should handle the issue wisely. Try this as a
starter guide.
■
Use power management, even if you’re plugged into the AC outlet.
This is especially important if you’re working in a warm (more than
80 degrees Fahrenheit) room.
■
Keep air space between the bottom of the laptop and the surface on
which it rests. Putting a laptop on a soft surface like a pillow on your
lap, for example, creates a great heat retention system—not a good
thing! Always use a hard, flat surface!
■
Don’t use a keyboard protector for extended amounts of time.
■
Listen to your fan, assuming the laptop has one. If it’s often running
very fast—you can tell by the high-pitched whirring sound—
examine your power management settings and your environment
and change whatever is causing heat retention.
■
Speaking of fans, be alert to a fan that suddenly goes silent. Fans do
fail on laptops, causing overheating and failure. All laptop fans can
be replaced easily.
Protect the Machine
While prices continue to drop for basic laptops, a fully loaded system is still
pricey. To protect your investment, you’ll want to adhere to certain best
practices. You’ve already read tips in this chapter to deal with cleaning and
heat, so let’s look at the “portable” part of portable computers.
Tripping
Pay attention to where you run the power cord when you plug in a laptop.
One of the primary causes of laptop destruction is people tripping over the
power cord and knocking the laptop off a desk. This is especially true if you
plug in at a public place such as a café or airport. Remember, the life you
save could be your portable PC’s!
Storage
If your laptop or PDA isn’t going to be used for a while, storing it safely will
go a long way toward keeping it operable when you do power it up again.
It’s worth the extra few dollars to invest in a quality case also—preferably
one with ample padding. Smaller devices such as PDAs are well protected
inside small shock-resistant aluminum cases that clip on to your belt while
laptops do fine in well-padded cases or backpacks. Not only will this protect
your system on a daily basis when transporting it from home to office, but it
will keep dust and pet hair away as well. Lastly, remove the battery if you’ll
be storing your device for an extended period of time to protect from battery
leakage.
Travel
If traveling with a laptop, take care to protect yourself from theft. If possi-
ble, use a case that doesn’t look like a computer case. A well-padded
backpack makes a great travel bag for a laptop and appears less tempting
302
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

to would-be thieves. Don’t forget to pack any accessories you might
need, like modular devices, spare batteries, and AC adapters. Make sure
to remove any disks, such as CD/DVD or floppies, from their drives.
Most importantly—back up any important data before you leave!
Make sure to have at least a little battery power available. Heightened
security at airports means you might have to power on your system to prove
it’s really a computer and not a transport case for questionable materials.
And never let your laptop out of your sight. If going through an x-ray ma-
chine, request a manual search. The x-ray won’t harm your computer like a
metal detector will, but if the laptop gets through the line at security before
you do, someone else might walk away with it. If flying, keep your laptop
out of the overhead bins and under the seat in front of you where you can
keep an eye on it.
If you travel to a foreign country, be very careful about the electricity.
North America uses ~115-V power outlets, but the most of the rest of the
world uses ~230-V outlets. Many portable computers have auto-switching
power supplies , meaning they detect the voltage at the outlet and adjust ac-
cordingly. For these portables, a simple plug converter will do the trick.
Other portable computers, however, have fixed-input power supplies, which
means they run only on ~115-V or ~230-V power. For these portables, you
need a full-blown electricity converting device, either a step-down or
step-up transformer. You can find converters and transformers at electrical
parts stores, such as Radio Shack in the U.S.
Shipping
Much of the storage and travel advice can be applied to shipping. Remove
batteries and CD/DVD/floppies from their drives. Pack the laptop well and
disguise the container as best you can. Back up any data and verify the war-
ranty coverage. Ship with a reputable carrier and always request a tracking
number and, if possible, delivery signature. It’s also worth the extra couple
of bucks to pay for the shipping insurance. And when the clerk asks what’s
in the box, it’s safer to say “electronics” rather than “a new 20-inch laptop
computer.”
Security
The fact is, if someone really wants to steal your laptop, they’ll find a way.
There are, however, some things you can do to make yourself, and your
equipment, a less desirable target. As you’ve already learned, disguise is a
good idea. While you don’t need to camouflage your laptop or carry it in a
brown grocery bag on a daily basis, an inconspicuous carrying case will
draw less attention.
Another physical deterrent is a laptop lock. Similar to a steel bicycle ca-
ble, there is a loop on one end and a lock on the other. The idea is to loop the
cable around a solid object, like a bed frame, and secure the lock to the small
security hole on the side of the laptop. Again, if someone really wants to
steal your computer, they’ll find a way. They’ll dismantle the bed frame if
they’re desperate. The best protection is to be vigilant and not let the com-
puter out of your sight.
Chapter 14: Portable Computing
303

An alternative to physically securing a laptop with a lock is to use a soft-
ware tracking system. Software makers, such as Computer Security Prod-
ucts, Inc. at www.computersecurity.com, offer tracking software that
transmits a signal to a central office if the laptop is stolen and connected to a
phone line or the Internet. The location of the stolen PC can be tracked, and
sensitive files can even be deleted automatically with the aid of the stealth
signal.
■Troubleshooting Portable
Computers
Many of the troubleshooting techniques you learned about for desktop sys-
tems can be applied to laptops. Additionally, there are some laptop-
specific procedures to try.
Laptop Won’t Power On
■
Verify AC power by plugging another electronic device into the wall
outlet. If the other device receives power, the outlet is good.
■
If the outlet is good, connect the laptop to the wall outlet and try to
power on. If no LEDs light up, you may have a bad AC adapter.
Swap it out with a known-good power adapter.
■
A faulty peripheral device might keep the laptop from powering up.
Remove any peripherals such as USB or FireWire devices.
Screen Doesn’t Come On Properly
■
If the laptop is booting (you hear the beeps and the drives), first
make sure the display is on. Press the FN key and the key to activate
the screen a number of times until the laptop display comes on.
■
If the laptop display is very dim, you may have lost an inverter. The
clue here is that inverters never go quietly. They can make a nasty
hum as they are about to die and an equally nasty popping noise
when they actually fail. Failure often occurs when you plug in the
laptop’s AC adapter, as the inverters take power directly from the
AC adapter.
Wireless Networking Doesn’t Work
■
Check for a physical switch along the front, rear, or side edges of the
laptop that toggles the internal wireless adapter on and off.
■
Try the special key combination for your laptop to toggle the wireless
adapter. You usually press the FN key in combination with another key.
■
You might simply be out of range. Physically walk the laptop over to
the wireless router or access point to ensure there are no “out of
range” issues.

Tech Tip
Battery Won't Charge
If you have a laptop with a bat-
tery that won't charge, it could be
one of two things: the battery is
cooked or the AC adapter isn't
doing its job. To troubleshoot, re-
place the battery with a known
good battery. If the new battery
works, then you've found the
problem. Just replace the battery.
Alternatively, remove the battery
and run the laptop on AC only. If
that works, you know the AC
adapter is good. If it doesn't, then
replace the AC adapter.

Handwriting Is Not Recognized
■
If your PDA or tablet PC no longer recognizes your handwriting or
stylus, you may need to retrain the digitizer. Look for an option in
your PDA OS settings to “align the screen.” On Windows tablet PCs,
you will find a similar option under Start | Settings | Control Panel.
Keypad Doesn’t Work
■
If none of the keys work on your laptop, there’s a good chance
you’ve unseated the keypad connector. These connectors are quite
fragile and are prone to unseating from any physical stress on the
laptop. Check the manufacturer’s disassembly procedures to locate
and reseat the keypad.
■
If you’re getting numbers when you’re expecting to get letters, the
number lock (NUMLOCK) function key is turned on. Turn it off.
Touchpad Doesn’t Work
■
A shot of compressed air does wonders for cleaning pet hair out of
the touchpad sensors. You’ll get a cleaner shot if you remove the
keyboard before using the compressed air. Remember to be gentle
when lifting off the keyboard and make sure to follow the
manufacturer’s instructions.
■
The touchpad driver might need to be reconfigured. Try the various
options in the Control Panel | Mouse applet.
Beyond A+
Centrino Technology
As mentioned previously in this chapter, consumers have always, and will
always, demand better performance, more features, and longer battery life
from their portable PCs. Intel, for example, promotes a combination of three
components—extremely low-power, yet speedy, CPUs; integrated wireless
networking technology; and an Intel chipset—that, when combined, pro-
duce portable PCs that not only are exceptionally powerful, but also boast
an extremely long battery life!
Origami—Ultra-Mobile PCs
Microsoft started pushing the Ultra-Mobile PC (UMPC) standard in 2005
and has started to get some traction in the industry. UMPCs are a small
form-factor tablet PC, designed to fill the spot between PDAs and tablet
PCs. Most of the versions use a 7-inch widescreen, touch-enabled LCD
(although at least one model on the market has a 4.3-inch widescreen
LCD) and feature everything you would expect to find in their bigger
Chapter 14: Portable Computing
305
Microsoft initially called the
UMPC project “Origami.” The
name has stuck, even though
Microsoft has since shifted over
to the more generic UMPC
name.

cousins, with the exception of optical drives. They have internal 30–80
GB hard drives, 512 MB to 1 GB of RAM, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for
connectivity, and more. Some even have USB and FireWire ports! All
weigh under 2 pounds and come in at under 1 inch thick.
The feature that most distinguishes UMPCs from PDAs is that the for-
mer runs a fully featured version of Windows XP, just like your desktop and
laptop PCs. Most UMPCs run Windows Tablet PC edition, although a few
devices run Windows XP Home or Windows Vista. (A few übergeeks have
even installed versions of Linux on UMPCs!) Figure 14.32 shows a Sony
VAIO UX UMPC.

Chapter 14 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
portable computers.
Portable Computing Devices
■
All portable devices share certain features: video
output using LCD screens, some kind of PC sound,
and DC battery power. There’s no industry standard
naming for the vast majority of styles of portable
computing devices.
■
A laptop refers in general to the clamshell, keyboard-
on-the-bottom, and LCD-screen-at-the-top design
that is considered the shape of mobile PCs. The
traditional clamshell laptop computer features a
built-in LCD monitor, keyboard, and input device,
and functions as a fully standalone PC. A portable PC
can be considered a desktop replacement if it does
everything that most people want to do with a
desktop PC.
■
Desktop extender portable devices don’t replace
the desktop, but rather extend it by giving you a
subset of features of the typical desktop that you
can take away from the desk. They are usually
smaller and lighter than desktop replacement
portables. Ultralight portables (sometimes called
subnotebooks, although the terms aren’t necessarily
synonymous) normally weigh less than three pounds
and are less than an inch in thickness. These
machines usually have smaller displays, lower-
capacity hard drives, and CPUs that operate at
lower speeds than their more full-sized brethren.
■
Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are handheld
portable computing devices that hold data such as
your address book and appointment schedules.
PDAs require specialized OSs such as Windows CE,
PocketPC, PalmOS, or Linux. All of these OSs
provide a GUI that enables you to interact with
the device by touching the screen directly. PDAs
synchronize with your PC, most often using a
cradle and USB port, so you have the same
essential data on both machines.
■
Over the years, input devices for portables have
ranged from trackballs that clipped to the case or
were built in near the keyboard to IBM’s
TrackPoint pencil eraser–sized joystick embedded
in the keyboard. The most common laptop
pointing device found today, the touchpad, is a
flat, touch-sensitive pad that you slide your finger
across to move the cursor or pointer around the
screen, and tap on to perform “mouse clicks.”
Enhance and Upgrade the Portable PC
■
PC Cards are roughly credit card–sized devices
that enhance and extend the functions of a portable
PC. Still commonly known by their older name,
PCMCIA cards, PC Cards are as standard on
today’s mobile computers as the hard drive.
Almost every portable PC has one or two PC Card
slots. All PC Cards are hot-swappable.
■
Parallel PC Cards come in two flavors, 16-bit and
CardBus, and each flavor comes in three different
physical sizes called Type I, Type II, and Type III.
Type I, II, and III cards differ only in the thickness of
the card (Type I being the thinnest, and Type III the
thickest). Type II cards are by far the most common.
All parallel PC Cards share the same 68-pin
interface. The 16-bit PC Cards are 16-bit, 5-V cards
that can have up to two distinct functions or devices,
such as a modem/network card combination.
CardBus PC Cards are 32-bit, 3.3-V cards that can
have up to eight different functions on a single card.
The 16-bit PC Cards will fit into and work in
CardBus slots, but the reverse is not true.
■
The serial ExpressCard comes in two widths:
54 mm and 34 mm. Both cards are 75 mm long and
5 mm thick, which makes them shorter than all
previous PC Cards and the same thickness as a
Type II PC Card. ExpressCards connect to either
the Hi-Speed USB 2.0 bus (480 Mbps) or a PCI
Express bus (2.5 Gbps).
Chapter 14: Portable Computing
307

■
The PCMCIA standard defines two levels of
software drivers to support PC Cards. The first,
lower level is known as socket services. Socket
services are device drivers that support the PC
Card socket, enabling the system to detect when a
PC Card has been inserted or removed, and
providing the necessary I/O to the device. The
second, higher level is known as card services. The
card-services level recognizes the function of a
particular PC Card and provides the specialized
drivers necessary to make the card work. In today’s
laptops, the socket services are standardized and
are handled by the system BIOS. Windows itself
handles all card services and has a large preinstalled
base of PC Card device drivers, although most PC
Cards come with their own drivers.
■
Every portable PC and many PDAs come with one
or more single-function ports, such as an analog
VGA connection for hooking up an external
monitor and a PS/2 port for a keyboard or mouse.
The single PS/2 port on most laptops supports
both keyboards and pointing devices. Most
portable computing devices have a speaker port,
and some have line-in and microphone jacks as
well. Most current portable PCs come with built-in
NICs or modems for networking support. Simply
plug a device into a particular port and, as long as
Windows has the proper drivers, you will have a
functioning device when you boot. The only port
that requires any extra effort is the video port.
■
Most laptops support a second monitor, giving
the user the option to display Windows on the
laptop only, the external monitor only, or both
simultaneously. Usually, a special function key on
the keyboard cycles through the different monitor
configurations.
■
Most portable PCs have one or more general-
purpose expansion ports that enable you to plug in
many different types of devices. Older portables
sport RS-232 serial and IEEE 1284 parallel ports
for mice, modems, printers, scanners, external
CD-media drives, and more. USB and FireWire are
popular and widespread methods for attaching
peripherals to laptops. Both have easy-to-use
connectors and can be hot-swapped.
■
Port replicators are devices that plug into a single
port (usually USB, but sometimes proprietary) and
offer common PC ports, such as serial, parallel,
USB, network, and PS/2. Docking stations
resemble port replicators in many ways, offering
legacy and modern single-function and multifunction
ports, but have extra features built in, such as DVD
drives or PC Card slots.
■
In the past, manufacturers required proprietary
components for portable PCs, but today’s portable
PCs offer some modularity, making it possible to
do basic replacements and upgrades without
buying expensive proprietary components from
the manufacturer. These replaceable components
include RAM, hard drives, video cards, floppy
drives, and CD-media devices. Modular video
cards are the least standardized of all modular
components, but manufacturers are beginning to
adopt industry-wide standards. Many manufacturers
use modular floppy disk drives and CD-media
devices, even allowing users to swap easily between
different types of drives.
■
Laptops use one of four types of RAM. Most older
laptops use either 72-pin or 144-pin SO-DIMMs
with SDRAM technology. DDR SDRAM systems
primarily use 200-pin SO-DIMMs, although you’ll
also find 172-pin micro-DIMMs. Every decent
laptop has upgradeable RAM slots. Get the correct
RAM; many portable PC makers use proprietary
RAM solutions. No standard exists for RAM
placement in portables. More often than not, you
need to unscrew or pop open a panel on the
underside of the portable and press out on the
restraining clips to make the RAM stick pop up so
that you can remove and replace it.
■
Laptops that support shared memory benefit from
more affordable video cards. The video card has
less built-in RAM and uses a portion of the
computer’s system RAM to make up the difference.
This results in a lower cost, but system performance
suffers because RAM that is shared with the video
card is not available to programs. Shared memory
technologies include TurboCache (by NVIDIA) and
HyperMemory (by ATI).
■
ATA drives in the 2.5-inch drive format now rule
in all laptops. Currently, the larger 2.5-inch hard
drives holds up to 120 GB while the larger 3.5-inch
hard drives hold more than 750 GB.
■
Both Intel and AMD have long sold specialized,
modular CPUs for laptops; however, replacing the
CPU in a laptop often requires disassembling the
entire machine.
308
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

■
To add functionality to laptops, manufacturers
include modular drives with their machines.
Modular drive bays can accommodate various
optical drives, hard drives, or batteries. Most
modular drives are truly hot-swappable, enabling
you to remove and insert devices without any
special software.
■
Many laptops now come with integrated wireless
networking support by way of a built-in Wi-Fi
adapter usually installed in a Mini PCI slot on the
laptop motherboard. The Mini PCI bus is an
adaptation of the standard PCI bus and was
developed specifically for integrated communications
peripherals such as modems and network adapters.
To extend battery life, built-in communication
devices such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters can
be toggled on and off without powering down the
computer.
Managing and Maintaining Portable Computers
■
Portable computers use three different types of
batteries: Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd), Nickel-Metal
Hydride (Ni-MH), and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion).
■
The first batteries used in mobile PCs were
Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd). If a Ni-Cd battery
was not completely discharged before each
recharge, it would lose a significant amount of its
rechargeability, a condition referred to as battery
memory. At best, Ni-Cd batteries would last for
1000 charges, but they were very susceptible to
heat. Because of the toxic metals inside these
batteries, they had to be disposed of via specialty
disposal companies. Although no longer used in
PCs, Ni-Cd batteries are still found in cellular and
cordless phones.
■
The second generation of mobile PC batteries,
the Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries are
less susceptible to memory problems, tolerate
overcharging better, take more recharging, and
last longer between rechargings, but they are still
susceptible to heat.
■
Although some portable PCs still use Ni-MH
batteries, Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) is more common
today. This third-generation battery takes fewer
charges than Ni-MH, but it lasts longer between
charges. Li-Ion batteries can explode if they are
overcharged, so they have circuitry to prevent
overcharging.
■
A new type of battery called the smart battery tells
the computer when it needs to be charged,
conditioned, or replaced.
■
Research continues on other power sources, with
the most promising technology being fuel cells that
produce electrical power as a result of a chemical
reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. A small
fuel cell may be able to power a laptop for up to 40
hours before it needs to be replaced or refilled.
■
Batteries should be stored in a cool place, but not in
the freezer because of moisture, metal racks, and
food. Condition Ni-Cd and Ni-MH batteries to
make them last longer. You can clean battery
contacts with alcohol or a dry cloth. Batteries
contain dangerous chemicals; never handle one
that has ruptured. Always recycle old batteries
rather than disposing of them in the trash.
■
The process of cooperation among the hardware,
the BIOS, and the OS to reduce power use is
known generically as power management. Early
laptops used power continuously, regardless of
whether the system was using the device at the
time or not. With power management features,
today’s laptops can automatically turn off unused
devices or can shut down the entire system,
leaving the information in RAM ready for a restart.
■
Starting with the 386SX, Intel introduced System
Management Mode (SMM), a power management
system that would make the CPU and all
peripherals go to “sleep.” In 1992, Intel introduced
the improved Advanced Power Management
(APM) specification, followed by the Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)
standard in 1996.
■
To use APM or ACPI, the computer must have an
SMM-capable CPU, an APM-compliant BIOS, and
devices that can be shut off. Referred to as “Energy
Star” devices, these peripherals can shut down
without actually turning off. The OS must also
know how to request that a particular device be
shut down. ACPI extends power-saving to include
hot-swappable devices.
■
Virtually all laptops and desktops use power
management functions. APM defines four
power-usage levels, including Full On, APM
Enabled, APM Standby, and APM Suspend.
Chapter 14: Portable Computing
309

■
Configure APM/ACPI through CMOS or through
the Power Options Control Panel applet in Windows
2000/XP, with Windows settings overriding CMOS
settings. Many CMOS versions enable configuration
of wake-up events, such as having the system
monitor a modem or particular IRQ.
■
Hibernation writes information from RAM to the
hard drive. Upon waking up, the data is returned
to RAM, and programs and files are in the same
state as when the computer entered hibernation.
■
Use an appropriate screen cleaner (not glass cleaner)
to clean the LCD screen. Use compressed air
around the keyboard and PC card sockets. Never
use water around the keyboard.
■
To combat the inevitable heat produced by a
portable computer, always use power management,
keep an air space between the bottom of the laptop
and the surface on which it rests, don’t use a
keyboard protector for an extended period of time,
and be aware of your fan.
■
Store your portable computer in a quality case
when traveling. Laptops benefit from a cushy
carrying case; hard aluminum cases keep your
PDA from getting banged up. Well-padded
backpacks not only keep your laptop protected, but
make your system less appealing to would-be
thieves. When traveling, don’t forget accessories
like AC power cords, additional batteries, or
modular devices. Remove all discs from drives and
make sure you have enough battery power to boot
up for security personnel. If shipping your
computer, go with a reputable carrier, keep your
tracking number, and request a delivery signature.
Use a laptop lock or a software tracking system to
protect your laptop when traveling.
Troubleshooting Portable Computers
■
If your laptop won’t power on, try a different wall
outlet. If it still fails to power up, remove all
peripheral devices and try again.
■
If the screen doesn’t come on properly, verify the
laptop is configured to use the built-in LCD screen
by pressing the appropriate key to cycle through
the internal and external monitors. If you hear a
popping sound, you may have blown an inverter.
■
If wireless networking is not working, check for the
physical switch that toggles the internal wireless
adapter on and off. If your laptop doesn’t have a
switch, check for a key combination that toggles
the wireless adapter. You also may be out of range.
Physically walk the laptop closer to the wireless
router or access point.
■
If your PDA or tablet PC fails to recognize
handwriting, retrain the digitizer. PDAs often have
a setting to align the screen; tablet PC users can
check the Control Panel for the appropriate applet.
■
If the keypad or touchpad doesn’t work, try a shot
of compressed air, reseat the physical internal
connection, or reconfigure the driver settings through
the Keyboard or Mouse Control Panel applets.

espite all of the talk about the "paperless office,"  printers continue to be a
vital part of the typical office. In many cases, PCs are used exclusively for
the purpose of producing paper documents. Many people simply prefer dealing
with a hard copy. Programmers cater to this preference by using metaphors such
as page, workbook, and binder in their applications. The CompTIA A+ certification
exams strongly stress the area of printing and expect a high degree of technical
knowledge of the function, components, maintenance, and repair of all types of
printers.

■Printer Technologies
No other piece of your computer system is available in a wider range of
styles, configurations, and feature sets than a printer, or at such a wide price
variation. What a printer can and can’t do is largely determined by the type
of printer technology it uses—that is, how it gets the image onto the paper.
Modern printers can be categorized into several broad types: impact, inkjet,
dye-sublimation, thermal, laser, and solid ink.
Impact Printers
Printers that create an image on paper by physically striking an ink ribbon
against the paper’s surface are known as impact printers . While daisy-wheel
printers (essentially an electric typewriter attached to the PC instead of di-
rectly to a keyboard) have largely disappeared, their cousins, dot-matrix
printers , still soldier on in many offices. While dot-matrix printers don’t de-
liver what most home users want—high-quality and flexibility at a low
cost—they’re still widely found in businesses for two reasons: dot-matrix
printers have a large installed base in businesses, and they can be used for
multipart forms because they actually strike the paper. Impact printers tend
to be relatively slow and noisy, but when speed, flexibility, and print quality
are not critical, they provide acceptable results. PCs used for printing
multipart forms, such as point of sale
(POS) machines that need to print re-
ceipts in duplicate, triplicate, or more,
represent the major market for new im-
pact printers, although many older
dot-matrix printers remain in use.
Dot-matrix printers (Figure 15.1) use
a grid, or matrix, of tiny pins, also
known as printwires , to strike an inked
printer ribbon and produce images on
paper.
The
case
that
holds
the
printwires is called a printhead . Using
either 9 or 24 pins, dot-matrix printers
treat each page as a picture broken up
into a dot-based raster image. The 9-pin
dot-matrix
printers
are
generically
called draft quality, while the 24-pin
printers are known as letter quality or
near-letter quality (NLQ) . The BIOS for
the
printer
(either
built
into
the
printer or a printer driver) interprets the
raster image in the same way that a moni-
tor does, “painting” the image as individ-
ual dots. Naturally, the more pins, the

higher the resolution. Figure 15.2
illustrates the components com-
mon to dot-matrix printers.
Inkjet Printers
Inkjet printers
(also called ink-
dispersion printers) like the one in
Figure 15.3 are relatively simple
devices consisting of a printhead
mechanism, support electronics,
a transfer mechanism to move
the printhead back and forth,
and a paper feed component to
drag,
move,
and
eject paper
(Figure
15.4).
They
work
by
ejecting ink through tiny tubes.
Most inkjet printers use heat to move the ink, while a
few use a mechanical method. The heat- method
printers use tiny resistors or electroconductive plates
at the end of each tube (Figure 15.5), which literally
boil the ink; this creates a tiny air bubble that ejects a
droplet of ink onto the paper, thus creating portions of
the image.
The ink is stored in special small containers called
ink cartridges . Older inkjet printers had two cartridges:
one for black ink and another for colored ink. The color
cartridge had separate compartments for cyan (blue),
magenta (red), and yellow ink, to print colors using a
method known as CMYK (you’ll read more about
CMYK later in this chapter). If your color cartridge ran
out of one of the colors, you had to purchase a whole
new color cartridge or deal with a messy refill kit.
Printer manufacturers began to separate the ink
colors into three separate cartridges, so that printers

came with four cartridges: one for each color and a
fourth for black (Figure 15.6). This not only was
more cost-effective for the user, but it also resulted in
higher quality printouts. Today you can find color
inkjet printers with six, eight, or more color car-
tridges. In addition to the basic CMYK inks, the
other cartridges provide for green, blue, gray, light
cyan, dark cyan, and more. Typically, the more ink
cartridges a printer uses, the higher the quality of the
printed image—and the higher the cost of the
printer.
The two key features of an inkjet printer are the
print resolution —that is, the density of ink, which af-
fects print quality—and the print speed. Resolution
is measured in dots per inch (dpi) ; higher numbers
mean that the ink dots on the page are closer to-
gether, so your printed documents will look better.
Resolution is most important when you’re printing
complex images such as full-color photos, or when
you’re printing for duplication and you care that your printouts look good.
Print speed is measured in pages per minute (ppm) , and this specification is
normally indicated right on the printer’s box. Most printers have one

(faster) speed for monochrome
printing—that is, using only black
ink—and another for full-color
printing.
Another feature of inkjet print-
ers is that they can support a stag-
gering array of print media. Using
an inkjet printer, you can print on
a variety of matte or glossy photo
papers,
iron-on
transfers,
and
other specialty media; some print-
ers can print directly onto spe-
cially coated optical discs, or even
fabric. Imagine running a T-shirt
through your printer with your
own custom slogan (how about
“I’m CompTIA A+ Certified!”).
The inks have improved over the
years, too, now delivering better quality and longevity than ever. Where
older inks would smudge if the paper got wet or start to fade after a short
time, modern inks are smudge proof and of archival quality—for example,
some inks by Epson are projected to last up to 200 years.
Dye-Sublimation Printers
The term sublimation means to cause something to change from a solid form
into a vapor and then back into a solid. This is exactly the process behind
dye-sublimation printing, sometimes called thermal dye transfer printing.
Dye-sublimation printers are used mainly for photo printing, high-end desk-
top publishing, medical and scientific imaging, or other applications for
which fine detail and rich color are more important than cost and speed.
Smaller, specialized printers called snapshot printers use dye-sublimation
specifically for printing photos at a reduced cost compared to their
full-sized counterparts.
The dye-sublimation printing technique is an example
of the so-called CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black)
method of color printing. It uses a roll of heat-sensitive
plastic film embedded with page-sized sections of cyan
(blue), magenta (red), and yellow dye; many also have a
section of black dye. A print head containing thousands of
heating elements, capable of precise temperature control,
moves across the film, vaporizing the dyes and causing
them to soak into specially-coated paper underneath before
cooling and reverting to a solid form. This process requires
one pass per page for each color. Some printers also use a fi-
nal finishing pass that applies a protective laminate coating
to the page. Figure 15.7 shows how a dye-sublimation
printer works.
Documents printed through the dye-sublimation pro-
cess display continuous tone images, meaning that the
printed image is not constructed of pixel dots, but is a

Pages per Minute versus Price
Printer speed is a key determinant of a printer’s price, and this is an easy
assertion to prove. Try this:

Fire up your browser and head over to the Web site for
Hewlett-Packard (www.hp.com), Canon (www.usa.canon.com),
Epson (www.epson.com), or Lexmark (www.lexmark.com).
These four companies make most of the printers on the market
today.

Pick a particular printer technology and check the price, from
the cheapest to the most expensive. Then look for printers that
have the same resolution but different ppm rates.

Check the prices and see how the ppm rate affects the price of

continuous blend of overlaid differing dye colors. This is in contrast to other
print technologies’ dithered images, which use closely packed, single-color
dots to simulate blended colors. Dye-sublimation printers produce
high-quality color output that rivals professional photo lab processing.
Thermal Printers
Thermal printers use a heated printhead to create a high-quality image on
special or plain paper. You’ll see two kinds of thermal printers in use. The
first is the direct thermal printer, and the other is the thermal wax transfer
printer. Direct thermal printers burn dots into the surface of special
heat-sensitive paper. If you remember the first generation of fax machines,
you’re already familiar with this type of printer. It is still used as a receipt
printer in many retail businesses. Thermal wax printers work similarly
to dye-sublimation printers, except that instead of using rolls of dye-
embedded film, the film is coated with colored wax. The thermal print head
passes over the film ribbon and melts the wax onto the paper. Thermal wax
printers don’t require special papers like dye-sublimation printers, so
they’re more flexible and somewhat cheaper to use, but their output isn’t
quite as good because they use color dithering.
Laser Printers
Using a process called electro-photographic imaging, laser printers produce
high-quality and high-speed output of both text and graphics. Figure 15.8
shows a typical laser printer. Laser printers rely on the photoconductive
properties of certain organic compounds. Photoconductive means that parti-
cles of these compounds, when exposed to light (that’s the “photo” part),
will conduct electricity. Laser printers usually use lasers as a light source be-
cause of their precision. Some lower-cost printers use LED arrays instead.
Chapter 15: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Printers
319
• Figure 15.8
Typical laser printer

The first laser printers created only monochrome images. Today, you
can also buy a color laser printer, although the vast majority of laser printers
produced today are still monochrome. Although a color laser printer can
produce complex full-color images such as photographs, they really shine
for printing what’s known as spot color—for example, eye-catching head-
ings, lines, charts, or other graphical elements that dress up an otherwise
plain printed presentation.
Critical Components of the Laser Printer
The CompTIA A+ certification exams take a keen interest in the particulars
of the laser printing process, so it pays to know your way around a laser
printer. Let’s take a look at the many components of a laser printer and their
functions (Figure 15.9).
Toner Cartridge
The toner cartridge in a laser printer (Figure 15.10) is so
named because of its most obvious activity—supplying the toner that
creates the image on the page. To reduce maintenance costs, however, many
other laser printer parts, especially those that suffer the most wear and tear,
have been incorporated into the toner cartridge. Although this makes
replacement of individual parts nearly impossible, it greatly reduces the
need for replacement; those parts that are most likely to break are replaced
every time you replace the toner cartridge.
Photosensitive Drum
The photosensitive drum is an aluminum cylinder
coated with particles of photosensitive compounds. The drum itself is
grounded to the power supply, but the coating is not. When light hits these
particles, whatever electrical charge they may have had “drains” out
through the grounded cylinder.
Erase Lamp
The erase lamp exposes the entire surface of the photosensitive
drum to light, making the photosensitive coating conductive. Any electrical
charge present in the particles bleeds away into the grounded drum, leaving
the surface particles electrically neutral.
Primary Corona
The
primary corona
wire, located close to the photo-
sensitive drum, never touches the drum. When the primary corona is

Tech Tip
Hidden Costs
Some printers use consumables—
such as ink—at a much faster
rate than others, prompting the
industry to rank printers in terms
of their cost per page. Using an
inexpensive printer (laser or
inkjet) costs around 4 cents per
page, while an expensive printer
can cost more than 20 cents per
page—a huge difference if you do
any volume of printing. This hid-
den cost is particularly pernicious
in the sub-US$100 inkjet printers
on the market. Their low prices
often entice buyers, who then dis-
cover that the cost of consumables
is outrageous—these days, a
single set of color and black
inkjet cartridges can cost as much
as the printer itself, if not more!
• Figure 15.9
Components inside a laser printer

charged with an extremely high
voltage, an electric field (or corona)
forms, enabling voltage to pass to
the
drum
and
charge
the
photosensitive
particles
on
its
surface. The primary grid regulates
the transfer of voltage, ensuring
that
the
surface
of
the
drum
receives a uniform negative voltage
of between ~600 and ~1000 volts.
Laser
The laser acts as the writing
mechanism of the printer. Any
particle on the drum struck by the
laser becomes conductive, enabling
its charge to be drained away into
the grounded core of the drum. The
entire surface of the drum has a uniform negative charge of between ~600
and ~1000 volts following its charging by the primary corona wire. When
particles are struck by the laser, they are discharged and left with a ~100 volt
negative charge. Using the laser, we can “write” an image onto the drum.
Note that the laser writes a positive image to the drum.
Toner
The toner in a laser printer is a fine powder made up of plastic
particles bonded to iron particles. The toner cylinder charges the toner with a
negative charge of between ~200 and ~500 volts. Because that charge falls
between the original uniform negative charge of the photosensitive drum
(~600 to ~1000 volts) and the charge of the particles on the drum’s surface
hit by the laser (~100 volts), particles of toner are attracted to the areas of the
photosensitive drum that have been hit by the laser (that is, areas that have a
relatively positive charge with reference to the toner particles).
Transfer Corona
To transfer the image from the photosensitive drum to the
paper, the paper must be given a charge that will attract the toner particles
off of the drum and onto the paper. The transfer corona is a thin wire,
usually protected by other thin wires, that applies a positive charge to the
paper, drawing the negatively charged toner particles to the paper. The
paper, with its positive charge, is also attracted to the negatively charged
drum. To prevent the paper from wrapping around the drum, a
static
charge eliminator removes the charge from the paper.
In most laser printers, the transfer corona is outside the toner cartridge,
especially in large commercial grade machines. The transfer corona is prone
to a build-up of dirt, toner, and debris through electrostatic attraction, and it
must be cleaned. It is also quite fragile—usually finer than a human hair.
Most printers with an exposed transfer corona will provide a special tool to
clean it, but you can also—very delicately—use a cotton swab soaked in
90 percent denatured alcohol (don’t use rubbing alcohol because it contains
emollients). As always, never service any printer without first turning it off
and unplugging it from its power source.
Fuser Assembly
The fuser assembly is almost always separate from the
toner cartridge. It is usually quite easy to locate as it will be close to the
Chapter 15: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Printers
321
• Figure 15.10
Laser printer’s toner cartridge

bottom of the toner cartridge and will usually have two rollers to fuse the
toner. Sometimes the fuser is somewhat enclosed and difficult to recognize,
because the rollers are hidden from view. To help you determine the
location of the fuser, think about the data path of the paper and the fact that
fusing is the final step of printing.
The toner is merely resting on top of the paper after the static charge
eliminator has removed the paper’s static charge. The toner must be perma-
nently attached to the paper to make the image permanent. Two rollers, a
pressure roller and a heated roller, are used to fuse the toner to the paper.
The pressure roller presses against the bottom of the page while the heated
roller presses down on the top of the page, melting the toner into the paper.
The heated roller has a nonstick coating such as Teflon to prevent the toner
from sticking to the heated roller.
Power Supplies
All laser printers have at least two separate power
supplies. The first power supply is called the “primary power supply” or
sometimes
just
the
“power
supply.”
This
power
supply,
which may actually be more than
one
power
supply,
provides
power to the motors that move the
paper, the system electronics, the
laser, and the transfer corona. The
high-voltage
power
supply
usually provides power only to the
primary corona. The extremely
high voltage of the high-voltage
power supply makes it one of the
most dangerous devices in the
world of PCs! Before opening a
printer to insert
a
new toner
cartridge, it is imperative that you
always turn off a laser printer!
Turning Gears
A laser printer has many mechanical functions. First, the
paper must be picked up, printed upon, and kicked out of the printer. Next,
the photosensitive roller must be turned and the laser, or a mirror, must be
moved from left to right. Finally, the toner must be evenly distributed, and
the fuser assembly must squish the toner into the paper. All these functions
are served by complex gear systems. In most laser printers, these gear
systems are packed together in discrete units generically called gear packs or
gearboxes. Most laser printers will have two or three gearboxes that a tech
can remove relatively easily in the rare case when one of them fails. Most
gearboxes also have their own motor or solenoid to move the gears.
System Board
Every laser printer contains at least one electronic board. On
this board is the main processor, the printer’s ROM, and RAM used to store
the image before it is printed. Many printers divide these functions among
two or three boards dispersed around the printer. An older printer may also
have an extra ROM chip and/or a special slot where you can install an extra
ROM chip, usually for special functions such as PostScript.
322

Cross Check
High Voltage—Keep Away!
The power supply inside a laser printer is not the only danger-
ous high-voltage toy in the world of PC equipment. You’ve learned
about two other potentially hazardous electrical components that you
should approach with caution.
1.
What are they?
2.
Which of these three items is potentially the most deadly?
To refresh your memory, check out Chapter 7, “Installing and Trou-
bleshooting Power Supplies,” and Chapter 12, “Installing and Trouble-
shooting Video.”

On some printer models you can upgrade the contents of these ROM
chips (the firmware) by performing a process called flashing the ROM. Flash-
ing is a lot like upgrading the system BIOS, which you learned about in
Chapter 4, “Working with BIOS and CMOS.” Upgrading the firmware can
help fix bugs, add new features, or update the fonts in the printer.
Of particular importance is the printer’s RAM. When the printer doesn’t
have enough RAM to store the image before it prints, you get a memory
overflow problem. Also, some printers will store other information in the
RAM, including fonts or special commands. Adding RAM is usually a sim-
ple job—just snapping in a SIMM or DIMM stick or two—but getting the
right RAM is important. Call or check the printer manufacturer’s Web site to
see what type of RAM you need. Although most printer companies will
happily sell you their expensive RAM, most printers can use generic DRAM
like the kind you use in a PC.
Ozone Filter
The coronas inside laser printers generate ozone (O3).
Although not harmful to humans in small amounts, even tiny concentrations
of ozone will cause damage to printer components. To counter this problem,
most laser printers have a special ozone filter that needs to be vacuumed or
replaced periodically.
Sensors and Switches
Every laser printer has a large number of sensors
and switches spread throughout the machine. The sensors are used to detect
a broad range of conditions such as paper jams, empty paper trays, or low
toner levels. Many of these sensors are really tiny switches that detect open
doors and so on. Most of the time these sensors/switches work reliably. Yet
occasionally, they can become dirty or broken, sending a false signal to the
printer. Simple inspection is usually sufficient to determine if a problem is
real or just the result of a faulty sensor/switch.
Solid Ink
Solid ink printers use just what you’d expect—solid inks. The technology
was originally developed by Tektronix, a company that was acquired by
Xerox. Solid ink printers use solid sticks of non-toxic “ink” that produce
more vibrant color than other print methods. The solid ink is melted and ab-
sorbed into the paper fibers; it then solidifies, producing a continuous tone
output. Unlike dye-sublimation printers, all colors are applied to the media
in a single pass, reducing the chances of misalignment. Solid ink sticks do
not rely on containers like ink for inkjet printers and can be “topped off”
midway through a print job by inserting additional color sticks without
taking the printer offline.
These printers are fast, too! A full-color print job outputs the first page in
about six seconds. Of course, all that speed and quality comes at a price.
Xerox’s base model starts at about twice the cost of a laser printer, with the
expensive model selling for about six times the cost! Solid ink printers be-
come a bit more affordable when you factor in the cost of consumables.
A single stick of ink costs about as much as an inkjet cartridge, for example,
but with a print capacity of 1000 pages, that completely beats the cost of
inkjet cartridges over time.

Printer Languages
Now that you’ve learned about the different types of print devices and tech-
niques, it’s time to take a look at how they communicate with the PC. How
do you tell a printer to make a letter A or to print a picture of your pet
iguana? Printers are designed to accept predefined printer languages that
handle both characters and graphics. Your software must use the proper
language when communicating with your printer so that your printer can
output your documents onto a piece of paper. Following are the more
common printer languages.
ASCII
You might think of the American Standard Code for Information Interchange
(ASCII) language as nothing more than a standard set of characters, the ba-
sic alphabet in upper and lowercase with a few strange symbols thrown in.
ASCII actually contains a variety of control codes for transferring data,
some of which can be used to control printers. For example, ASCII code 10
(or 0A in hex) means “Line Feed,” and ASCII code 12 (0C) means “Form
Feed.” These commands have been standard since before the creation of
IBM PCs, and all printers respond to them. If they did not, the PRT SCR (print
screen) key would not work with every printer. Being highly standardized
has advantages, but the control codes are extremely limited. Printing
high-end graphics and a wide variety of fonts requires more advanced
languages.
PostScript
Adobe Systems developed the PostScript page description language in the
early 1980s as a device-independent printer language capable of high-
resolution graphics and scalable fonts. PostScript interpreters are embedded in
the printing device. Because PostScript is understood by printers at a hardware
level, the majority of the image processing is done by the printer and not the
PC’s CPU, so PostScript printers print fast. PostScript defines the page as a
single raster image; this makes PostScript files extremely portable—they can be
created on one machine or platform and reliably printed out on another
machine or platform (including, for example, high-end typesetters).
Hewlett Packard Printer Control Language (PCL)
Hewlett Packard developed its printer control language (PCL) as a more ad-
vanced printer language to supersede simple ASCII codes. PCL features a
set of printer commands greatly expanded from ASCII. Hewlett Packard de-
signed PCL with text-based output in mind; it does not support advanced
graphical functions. The most recent version of PCL, PCL6 features scalable
fonts and additional line drawing commands. Unlike PostScript, however,
PCL is not a true page description language; it uses a series of commands to
define the characters on the page. Those commands must be supported by
each individual printer model, making PCL files less portable than
PostScript files.

Windows GDI
Windows 2000/XP use the graphical device interface (GDI) component of
the operating system to handle print functions. Although you can use an ex-
ternal printer language such as PostScript, most users simply install printer
drivers and let Windows do all the work. The GDI uses the CPU rather than
the printer to process a print job and then sends the completed job to the
printer. When you print a letter with a TrueType font in Windows, for exam-
ple, the GDI processes the print job and then sends bitmapped images of
each page to the printer. Therefore, the printer sees a page of TrueType text
as a picture, not as text. As long as the printer has a capable enough raster
image processor (explained later in this chapter) and plenty of RAM, you
don’t need to worry about the printer language in most situations. We’ll re-
visit printing in Windows in more detail later in this chapter.
Printer Connectivity
Most printers connect to one of two ports on the PC: a DB-25 parallel port or
a USB port. The parallel connection is the classic way to plug in a printer, but
most printers today use USB. You’ll need to know how to support the more
obscure parallel ports, cables, and connections as well as the plug-and-play
USB connections.
Parallel Communication and Ports
The parallel port was included in the original IBM PC as a faster alternative
to serial communication. The IBM engineers considered serial communi-
cation, limited to 1 bit at a time, to be too slow for the “high-speed” devices
of the day (for example, dot-matrix printers). The standard parallel port has
been kept around for backward compatibility despite several obvious
weaknesses.
Parallel ports may be far faster than serial ports, but they are slow by
modern standards. The maximum data transfer rate of a standard parallel
port is still only approximately 150 kilobytes per second (KBps). Standard
parallel communication on the PC also relies heavily on software, eating up
a considerable amount of CPU time that could be better used.
Parallel ports are hindered by their lack of true bidirectional capability.
One-way communication was acceptable for simple line printers and
dot-matrix printers, but parallel communication became popular for a wide
range of external devices that required two-way communication. Although
it is possible to get two-way communication out of a standard parallel port,
the performance is not impressive.
IEEE 1284 Standard
In 1991, a group of printer manufacturers proposed to the Institute of Electri-
cal and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) that a committee be formed to propose a
standard for a backward-compatible, high-speed, bidirectional parallel port
for the PC. The committee was the IEEE 1284 committee (hence the name of
the standard).
Chapter 15: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Printers
325
Although the phrase
“Centronics standard” was com-
monly used in the heyday of
parallel ports, no such animal
actually existed. Prior to the de-
velopment of IEEE 1284, a very
loose set of “standards” were
adopted by manufacturers in an
attempt to reduce incompatibil-
ity issues somewhat.
Many techs confuse the con-
cept of duplex printing—a pro-
cess that requires special
printers capable of printing on
both sides of a sheet of paper—
with bidirectional printing. They
are two different things!

The IEEE 1284 standard requires the following:
■
Support for five distinct modes of operation: compatibility mode,
nibble mode, byte mode, EPP, and ECP
■
A standard method of negotiation for determining which modes are
supported both by the host PC and by the peripheral device
■
A standard physical interface (that is, the cables and connectors)
■
A standard electrical interface (that is, termination, impedance, and
so on)
Because only one set of data wires exists, all data transfer modes in-
cluded in the IEEE 1284 standard are half-duplex: Data is transferred in only
one direction at a time.
Parallel Connections, Cabling, and Electricity
Although no true standard exists, “standard parallel cable”
usually refers to a printer cable with the previously-mentioned
male DB-25 connector on one end and a 36-pin Centronics con-
nector
on the other (Figure 15.11). The shielding (or lack
thereof) of the internal wiring and other electrical characteris-
tics of a standard parallel printer cable are largely undefined
except by custom. In practice, these standard cables are accept-
able for transferring data at 150 KBps, and for distances of less
than 6 feet, but they would be dangerously unreliable for some
transfer modes.
For more reliability at distances up to 32 feet (10 meters),
use proper IEEE 1284–compliant cabling. The transfer speed
drops with the longer cables, but it does work, and sometimes
the trade-off between speed and distance is worth it.
Installing a parallel cable is a snap. Just insert the DB-25
connector into the parallel port on the back of the PC and insert the
Centronics connector into the printer’s Centronics port, and you’re ready to
go to press!
USB Printers
New printers now use USB connections that can be plugged into any USB
port on your computer. USB printers don’t usually come with a USB cable, so
you need to purchase one at the time you purchase a printer. (It’s quite a dis-
appointment to come home with your new printer only to find you can’t con-
nect it because it didn’t come with a USB cable.) Most printers use the
standard USB type A connector on one end and the smaller USB type B con-
nector on the other end, although some use two type A connectors. Which-
ever configuration your USB printer has, just plug in the USB cable—it’s
literally that easy!
FireWire Printers
Some printers offer FireWire connections in addition to or instead of USB
connections. A FireWire printer is just as easy to connect as a USB printer, as
FireWire is also hot-swappable and hot-pluggable. Again, make sure you

IEEE 1284 Transfer
Modes
The five modes of operation for
parallel printing specified in the
IEEE 1284 standard (compatibil-
ity, nibble, byte, EPP, ECP) are
inching closer to obsolescence as
USB printers take over the mar-
ket. You can look up these modes
by name using various Web
search tools, if you find yourself
needing to optimize the perfor-
mance of a legacy parallel printer.

Some printers come with
both USB and parallel connec-
tions, but this is becoming in-
creasingly rare. If you need a
parallel printer for a system, be
sure to confirm that the particu-
lar model you want will work

have the proper cable, as most printers don’t come with one. If your printer
has both connections, which one should you use? The answer is easy if your
PC has only USB and not FireWire. If you have a choice, either connection is
just as good as the other, and the speeds are comparable. If you already have
many USB devices, you may want to use the FireWire printer connection, to
leave a USB port free for another device.
Network Printers
Connecting a printer to a network isn’t just for offices anymore. More and
more homes and home offices are enjoying the benefits of network printing.
It used to be that to share a printer on a network—that is, to make it available
to all network users—you would physically connect the printer to a single
computer and then share the printer on the network. The downside to this
was that the computer to which the printer was connected had to be left on
for others to use the printer.
Today, the typical network printer comes with its own onboard network
adapter that uses a standard RJ-45 Ethernet cable to connect the printer di-
rectly to the network by way of a router. The printer can typically be as-
signed a static IP address, or it can acquire one dynamically from a DHCP
server. Once connected to the network, the printer acts independently of
any single PC. Some of the more costly network printers come with a
built-in Wi-Fi adapter to connect to the network wirelessly. Alternatively,
some printers offer Bluetooth interfaces for networking.
Even if a printer does not come with built-in Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or
Bluetooth, you can purchase a standalone network device known as a print
server to connect your printer to the network. These print servers, which can
be Ethernet or Wi-Fi, enable one or several printers to attach via parallel port
or USB. So take that ancient ImageWriter dot-matrix printer and network
it—I dare you!
Other Printers
Plenty of other connection types are available for printers. We’ve focused
mainly on parallel, USB, FireWire, and networked connections. Be aware
that you may run into an old serial port printer or a SCSI printer. While this
is unlikely, know that it’s a possibility.
■The Laser Printing Process
The laser printing process can be broken down into six steps, and the
CompTIA A+ exams expect you to know them all. As a tech, you should be
familiar with these phases, as this can help you troubleshoot printing prob-
lems. For example, if an odd line is printed down the middle of every page,
you know there’s a problem with the photosensitive drum or cleaning
mechanism and the toner cartridge needs to be replaced.
You’ll look into the physical steps that occur each time a laser printer revs
up and prints a page; then you’ll see what happens electronically to ensure
that the data is processed properly into flawless, smooth text and graphics.
Chapter 15: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Printers
327

The Physical Side of the Process
Most laser printers perform the printing process in a series of six steps. Keep
in mind that some brands of laser printers may depart somewhat from this
process, although most work in exactly this order:
1.
Clean
2.
Charge
3.
Write
4.
Develop
5.
Transfer
6.
Fuse
Clean the Drum
The printing process begins with the physical and electrical
cleaning of the photosensitive drum (Figure 15.12). Before print-
ing each new page, the drum must be returned to a clean, fresh
condition. All residual toner left over from printing the previous
page must be removed, usually by scraping the surface of the
drum with a rubber cleaning blade. If residual particles remain
on the drum, they will appear as random black spots and streaks
on the next page. The physical cleaning mechanism either depos-
its the residual toner in a debris cavity or recycles it by returning
it to the toner supply in the toner cartridge. The physical cleaning
must be done carefully. Damage to the drum will cause a perma-
nent mark to be printed on every page.
The printer must also be electrically cleaned. One or more erase
lamps bombard the surface of the drum with the appropriate wave-
lengths of light, causing the surface particles to discharge into the
grounded drum. After the cleaning process, the drum should be
completely free of toner and have a neutral charge.
Charge the Drum
To make the drum receptive to new images, it must be charged
(Figure 15.13). Using the primary corona wire, a uniform nega-
tive charge is applied to the entire surface of the drum (usually
between ~600 and ~1000 volts).
Write and Develop the Image
A laser is used to write a positive image on the surface of the drum.
Every particle on the drum hit by the laser will release most of its
negative charge into the drum. Those particles with a lesser nega-
tive charge will be positively charged relative to the toner particles
and will attract them, creating a developed image (Figure 15.14).
Transfer the Image
The printer must transfer the image from the drum onto the paper.
The transfer corona is used to give the paper a positive charge. Once
the paper has a positive charge, the negatively charged toner

der of a laser printer’s printing
process! Here’s a mnemonic to

Down The Facts.

particles leap from the drum to the paper. At this point, the particles are merely
resting on the paper. They must still be permanently fused to the paper.
Fuse the Image
The particles have been attracted to the paper because of the paper’s posi-
tive charge, but if the process stopped here, the toner particles would fall off
the page as soon as the page was lifted. Because the toner particles are
mostly composed of plastic, they can be melted to the page. Two rollers—a
heated roller coated in a nonstick material and a pressure roller—melt the
toner to the paper, permanently affixing it. Finally, a static charge eliminator
removes the paper’s positive charge (Figure 15.15). Once the page is com-
plete, the printer ejects the printed copy and the process begins again with
the physical and electrical cleaning of the printer.

Tech Tip
Laser Printing
in Color
Color laser printers use four dif-
ferent colors of toner (cyan, ma-
genta, yellow, and black) to create
their printouts. Most models put
each page through four different
passes, adding one color at each
pass to create the needed results,
while others place all the colors
onto a special belt and then trans-
fer them to the page in one pass.
In some cases, the printer uses
four separate toner cartridges and
four lasers for the four toner col-
ors, and in others the printer sim-
ply lays down one color after the
other on the same drum, cleaning
after each of four passes per page.
The heated roller produces
enough heat to melt some types
of plastic media, particularly
overhead transparency materi-
als. This could damage your
laser printer (and void your
warranty), so make sure you’re
printing on transparencies
designed for laser printers!

The Electronic Side of the Process
When you click the Print button in an application, several things happen.
First, the CPU processes your request and sends a print job to an area of
memory called the print spooler. The print spooler enables you to queue up
multiple print jobs that the printer will handle sequentially. Next, Windows
sends the first print job to the printer. That’s your first potential bottle-
neck—if it’s a big job, the OS has to dole out a piece at a time, and you’ll see
the little printer icon in the notification area at the bottom right of your
screen. Once the printer icon goes away, you know the print queue is
empty—all jobs have gone to the printer.
Once the printer receives some or all of a print job, the hardware of the
printer takes over and processes the image. That’s your second potential
bottleneck, and it has multiple components.
Raster Images
Impact printers transfer data to the printer one character or one line at a
time, whereas laser printers transfer entire pages at a time to the printer.
A laser printer generates a raster image (a pattern of dots) of the page repre-
senting what the final product should look like. It uses a device (the laser) to
“paint” a raster image on the photosensitive drum. Because a laser printer
has to paint the entire surface of the photosensitive drum before it can begin
to transfer the image to paper, it processes the image one page at a time.
A laser printer uses a chip called the raster image processor (RIP) to
translate the raster image sent to the printer into commands to the laser. The
RIP takes the digital information about fonts and graphics and converts it to
a rasterized image made up of dots that can then be printed. An inkjet
printer also has a RIP, but it’s part of the software driver instead of onboard
hardware circuitry. The RIP needs memory (RAM) to store the data that it
must process. A laser printer must have enough memory to process an en-
tire page. Some images that require high resolutions require more memory.
Insufficient memory to process the image will usually be indicated by a
memory overflow (“MEM OVERFLOW”) error. If you get a memory over-
flow error, try reducing the resolution, printing smaller graphics, or turning
off RET (see the following section for the last option). Of course, the best so-
lution to a memory overflow error is simply to add more RAM to the laser
printer.
Do not assume that every error with the word memory in it can be fixed
simply by adding more RAM to the printer. Just as adding more RAM chips
will not solve every conventional PC memory problem, adding more RAM
will not solve every laser printer memory problem. The message “21
ERROR” on an HP LaserJet, for example, indicates that “the printer is un-
able to process very complex data fast enough for the print engine.” This
means that the data is simply too complex for the RIP to handle. Adding
more memory would not solve this problem; it would only make your wal-
let lighter. The only answer in this case is to reduce the complexity of the
page image (that is, fewer fonts, less formatting, reduced graphics
resolution, and so on).

Tech Tip
Inkjet RIPs
Inkjet printers use RIPs as well,
but they’re written into the device
drivers instead of the onboard
programming. You can also buy
third-party RIPs that can im-
prove the image quality of your
printouts; for an example, see
www.colorbytesoftware.com.

Resolution
Laser printers can print at different resolutions, just as monitors can display
different resolutions. The maximum resolution that a laser printer can handle is
determined by its physical characteristics. Laser printer resolution is expressed
in dots per inch (dpi). Common resolutions are 600 × 600 dpi or 1200 × 1200 dpi.
The first number, the horizontal resolution, is determined by how fine a focus
can be achieved by the laser. The second number is determined by the smallest
increment by which the drum can be turned. Higher resolutions produce
higher quality output, but keep in mind that higher resolutions also require
more memory. In some instances, complex images can be printed only at lower
resolutions because of their high-memory demands. Even printing at 300 dpi,
laser printers produce far better quality than dot-matrix
printers because of
resolution enhancement technology
(RET) .
RET enables the printer to insert smaller dots among
the characters, smoothing out the jagged curves that are
typical of printers that do not use RET (Figure 15.16). Us-
ing RET enables laser printers to output high-quality
print jobs, but it also requires a portion of the printer’s
RAM. If you get a MEM OVERFLOW error, sometimes
disabling RET will free up enough memory to complete
the print job.
■Installing a Printer in Windows
You need to take a moment to understand how Windows 2000 and Win-
dows XP handle printing, and then you’ll see how to install, configure, and
troubleshoot printers in these operating systems.
To Windows 2000/XP, a “printer” is not a physical device; it is a program
that controls one or more physical printers. The physical printer is called a
“print device” to Windows (although I continue to use the term “printer” for
most purposes, just like almost every tech on the planet).
Printer drivers and a spooler are still present, but in Win-
dows 2000/XP they are integrated into the printer itself
(Figure 15.17). This arrangement gives Windows 2000/
XP amazing flexibility. For example, one printer can sup-
port multiple print devices, enabling a system to act as a
print server. If one print device goes down, the printer au-
tomatically redirects the output to a working print device.
The general installation, configuration, and trouble-
shooting issues are basically identical in Windows 2000
and Windows XP. Here’s a review of a typical Windows
printer installation. I’ll mention the trivial differences
between Windows 2000 and XP as I go along.
Setting Up Printers
Setting up a printer is so easy that it’s almost scary. Most printers are plug
and play, so installing a printer is reduced to simply plugging it in and
Chapter 15: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Printers

• Figure 15.16

jagged characters.

loading the driver if needed. If the system does not detect the printer or if the
printer is not plug and play, click Start | Printers and Faxes in Windows XP
to open the Printers applet; in Windows 2000, click Start | Settings | Print-
ers. The icon for this applet can also be found in the Control Panel.
As you might guess, you install a new
printer by clicking the Add Printer icon (some-
how Microsoft has managed to leave the name
of this applet unchanged through all Windows
versions since 9x). This starts the Add Printer
Wizard. After a pleasant intro screen, you must
choose to install either a printer plugged di-
rectly into your system or a network printer
(Figure 15.18). You also have the Automatically
detect and install my Plug and Play printer option,
which you can use in many cases when install-
ing a USB printer.
If you choose a local printer, the applet next
asks you to select a port (Figure 15.19); select
the one where you installed the new printer.
Once you select the port, Windows asks you to
specify the type of printer, either by selecting
the type from the list or using the Have Disk
option, just as you would for any other device
(Figure 15.20). Note the handy Windows Up-
date button, which you can use to get the latest
printer driver from the Internet. When you click Next on this screen, Win-
dows installs the printer.
Figure 15.21 shows a typical Windows XP Printers and Faxes screen on a
system with one printer installed. Note the small check mark in the icon’s
corner; this shows that the device is the default printer. If you have multiple
printers, you can change the default printer by selecting the printer’s prop-
erties and checking Make Default Printer.

Selecting a printer model/driver in Windows XP

In addition to the regular driver installation outlined previously, some
installations use printer emulation. Printer emulation simply means using a
substitute printer driver for a printer, as opposed to using one made exclu-
sively for that printer. You’ll run into printer emulation in two circum-
stances. First, some new printers do not come with their own drivers. They
instead emulate a well-known printer (such as an HP LaserJet 4) and run
perfectly well on that printer driver. Second, you may see emulation in the
“I don’t have the right driver!” scenario. I keep about three different HP La-
serJet and Epson inkjet printers installed on my PC as I know that with these
printer drivers, I can print to almost any printer. Some printers may require
you to set them into an emulation mode to handle a driver other than their
native one.
Optimizing Print Performance
Although a quality printer is the first step toward quality output, your out-
put relies on factors other than the printer itself. What you see on the screen
may not match what comes out of the printer, so calibration is important.
Using the wrong type of paper can result in less than acceptable printed doc-
uments. Configuring the printer driver and spool settings can also affect
your print jobs.
Calibration

only to discover that the final printout was darker than you had hoped,

Tech Tip
Readme Files
You’ve seen how to get your sys-
tem to recognize a printer, but
what do you do when you add a
brand-new printer? Like most pe-
ripherals, the printer will include
an installation CD-ROM that
contains various useful files. One
of the most important, but least
used, tools on this CD-ROM is
the Readme file. This file, gener-
ally in TXT format, contains the
absolute latest information on
any idiosyncrasies, problems, or
incompatibilities related to your
printer or printer driver. Usually,
you can find it in the root folder
of the installation CD-ROM, al-
though many printer drivers in-
stall the Readme file on your hard
drive, so you can access it from
the Start menu. The rule here is
read first to avoid a headache
later!

consider calibrating your monitor. Calibration matches the print output of
your printer to the visual output on your monitor and governs that through
software. All three parts need to be set up properly for you to print what you
see consistently.
Computer monitors output in RGB—that is, they compose colors using
red, green, and blue pixels—while printers mix their colors differently to ar-
rive at their output. For example, the CMYK method composes colors from
cyan (blue), magenta (red), yellow, and black.
The upshot of all this is that the printer tries to output using CMYK (or
another technique) what you see on the screen using RGB. Because the two
color modes do not create color the same way, you see color shifts and
not-so-subtle differences between the onscreen image and the printed im-
age. By calibrating your monitor, you can adjust the setting to match the out-
put of your printer. This can be done manually through “eyeballing” it or
automatically using calibration hardware.
To calibrate your monitor manually, obtain a test image from the Web (try
sites such as www.DigitalDog.net) and print it out. If you have a good eye, you
can compare this printout to what you see on the screen and make the adjust-
ments manually through your monitor’s controls or display settings.
Another option is to calibrate your printer through the use of an Interna-
tional Color Consortium (ICC) color profile, a preference file that instructs
your printer to print colors a certain way—for example, to match what is on
your screen. Loading a different color profile results in a different color out-
put. Color profiles are sometimes included on the installation CD-ROM
with a printer, but you can create or purchase custom profiles as well. The
use of ICC profiles is not limited to printers; you can also use them to control
the output of monitors, scanners, or even digital cameras.
■Troubleshooting Printers
As easy as printers are to set up, they are equally robust at running, assum-
ing that you install the proper drivers and keep the printer well maintained.
But printer errors do occasionally develop. Take a look at the most common
print problems with Windows 2000/XP as well as problems that crop up
with specific printer types.
General Troubleshooting Issues
Printers of all stripes share some common problems, such as print jobs that
don’t go, strangely sized prints, and misalignment. Other issues include
consumables, sharing multiple printers, and crashing on power-up. Let’s
take a look at these general troubleshooting issues, but start with a recap of
the tools of the trade.
Tools of the Trade
Before you jump in and start to work on a printer that’s giving you fits,
you’ll need some tools. You can use the standard computer tech tools in
334
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

your toolkit, plus a couple of printer-specific devices. Here are some that
will come in handy:
■
A multimeter for troubleshooting electrical problems such as faulty
wall outlets
■
Various cleaning solutions, such as denatured alcohol
■
An extension magnet for grabbing loose screws in tight spaces and
cleaning up iron-based toner
■
An optical disc or USB thumb drive with test patterns for checking
print quality
■
Your trusty screwdriver—both a Phillips-head and flat-head because
if you bring just one kind, it’s a sure bet that you’ll need the other
Print Job Never Prints
If you click Print but nothing comes out of the printer, first check all the
obvious possibilities. Is the printer on? Is it connected? Is it online? Does it
have paper? Assuming the printer is in good order, it’s time to look at the
spooler. You can see the spooler status either by
double-clicking the printer’s icon in the Printers applet
or by double-clicking the tiny printer icon in the
notification area if it’s present. If you’re having a
problem, the printer icon will almost always be there.
Figure 15.22 shows the print spooler open.
Print spoolers can easily overflow or become cor-
rupt due to a lack of disk space, too many print jobs, or
one of a thousand other factors. The status window
shows all of the pending print jobs and enables you to
delete, start, or pause jobs. I usually just delete the af-
fected print job(s) and try again.
Print spoolers are handy. If the printer goes down,
you can just leave the print jobs in the spooler until the
printer comes back online. Some versions of Windows require
you to select Resume Printing manually, but others will auto-
matically continue the print job(s). If you have a printer that
isn’t coming on anytime soon, you can simply delete the print
job in the spooler window and try another printer.
If you have problems with the print spooler, you can get
around it by changing your print spool settings. Go into the
Printers and Faxes applet, right-click the icon of the printer in
question, and choose Properties. In the resulting Properties
window (see Figure 15.23), choose the Print directly to the
printer radio button and click OK; then try sending your print
job again. Note that this window also offers you the choice of
printing immediately—that is, starting to print pages as soon
as the spooler has enough information to feed to the
printer—or holding off on printing until the entire job is
spooled.
Another possible cause for a stalled print job is that the
printer is simply waiting for the correct paper! Laser printers
in particular have settings that tell them what size paper is in

their standard paper tray or trays. If the application sending a print job spec-
ifies a different paper size—for example, it wants to print a standard No. 10
envelope, or perhaps a legal sheet, but the standard paper tray holds only
8.5 × 11 letter paper—the printer will usually pause and hold up the queue
until someone switches out the tray or manually feeds the type of paper
that’s required for this print job. You can usually override this by pressing
the OK or GO button on the printer or by manually feeding any size paper
you want just to clear out the print queue, but the printer is doing its best to
print the job properly.
The printer’s default paper tray and paper size options will differ
greatly depending on the printer type and model. To find these settings, go
into the printer’s Properties window from the Printers and Faxes applet,
and then select the Device Settings tab. This list of settings includes Form To
Tray Assignment, where you can specify which tray (in the case of a printer
with multiple paper trays) holds which size paper.
Strange Sizes
A print job that comes out a strange size usually points to a user mis-
take in setting up the print job. All applications have a Print command
and a Page Setup interface. The Page Setup interface enables you to
define a number of print options, which vary from application to ap-
plication. Figure 15.24 shows the Page Setup options for Microsoft
Word. Make sure the page is set up properly before you blame the
printer for a problem.
If you know the page is set up correctly, recheck the printer driv-
ers. If necessary, uninstall and reinstall the printer drivers. If the prob-
lem persists, you may have a serious problem with the printer’s print
engine, but that comes up as a likely answer only when you continu-
ally get the same strangely sized printouts using a number of different
applications.
Misaligned or Garbage Prints
Misaligned or garbage printouts invariably point to a corrupted or in-
correct driver. Make sure you’re using the right driver (it’s hard to
mess this up, but not impossible) and then uninstall and reinstall the
printer driver. If the problem persists, you may be asking the printer to
do something it cannot do. For example, you may be printing to a Post-
Script printer with a PCL driver. Check the printer type to verify that
you haven’t installed the wrong type of driver for that printer!
Dealing with Consumables
All printers tend to generate a lot of trash in the form of consumables . Im-
pact printers use paper and ribbons, inkjet printers use paper and ink car-
tridges, and laser printers use paper and toner cartridges. In today’s
environmentally sensitive world, many laws regulate the proper disposal of
most printer components. Be sure to check with the local sanitation depart-
ment or disposal services company before throwing away any component.
Of course, you should never throw away toner cartridges—certain compa-
nies will pay for used cartridges!

Problems Sharing Multiple Printers
If you want to use multiple printers attached to the same parallel port, you
have to use a switch box. Laser printers should never be used with mechani-
cal switch boxes. Mechanical switch boxes create power surges that can
damage your printer. If you must use a switch box, use a box that switches
between printers electronically and has built-in surge protection.
Crashes on Power-up
Both laser printers and PCs require more power during their initial power-up
(the POST on a PC and the warm-up on a laser printer) than once they are run-
ning. Hewlett Packard recommends a reverse power-up. Turn on the laser
printer first and allow it to finish its warm-up before turning on the PC. This
avoids having two devices drawing their peak loads simultaneously.
Troubleshooting Dot-Matrix Printers
Impact printers require regular maintenance but will run forever as long as
you’re diligent. Keep the platen (the roller or plate on which the pins im-
pact) clean and the printhead clean with denatured alcohol. Be sure to lubri-
cate gears and pulleys according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Never
lubricate the printhead, however, because the lubricant will smear and stain
the paper.
Bad-Looking Text
White bars going through the text point to a dirty or damaged printhead.
Try cleaning the printhead with a little denatured alcohol. If the problem
persists, replace the printhead. Printheads for most printers are readily
available from the manufacturer or from companies that rebuild them. If the
characters look chopped off at the top or bottom, the printhead probably
needs to be adjusted. Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for proper
adjustment.
Bad-Looking Page
If the page is covered with dots and small smudges—the “pepper
look”—the platen is dirty. Clean the platen with denatured alcohol. If the
image is faded, and you know the ribbon is good, try adjusting the
printhead closer to the platen. If the image is okay on one side of the paper
but fades as you move to the other, the platen is out of adjustment. Platens
are generally difficult to adjust, so your best plan is to take it to the manufac-
turer’s local warranty/repair center.
Troubleshooting Inkjet Printers
Inkjet printers are reliable devices that require little maintenance as long as
they are used within their design parameters (high-use machines will re-
quire more intensive maintenance). Because of the low price of these print-
ers, manufacturers know that people don’t want to spend a lot of money
keeping them running. If you perform even the most basic maintenance
tasks, they will soldier on for years without a whimper. Inkjets generally

Tech Tip
Check the MSDS
When in doubt about what to do
with a component, check with the
manufacturer for a material
safety data sheet (MSDS) . These
standardized forms provide de-
tailed information about the po-
tential environmental hazards
associated with different compo-
nents and proper disposal meth-
ods. For example, surf to www.
hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/
environment/productdata/index
.html to find the latest MSDS for
all Hewlett-Packard products.
This isn’t just a printer issue—
you can find an MSDS for most
PC components.

have built-in maintenance programs that you should run
from time to time to keep your inkjet in good operating
order.
Inkjet Printer Maintenance
Inkjet printers don’t get nearly as dirty as laser printers, and
most manufacturers do not recommend periodic cleaning.
Unless your manufacturer explicitly tells you to do so, don’t
vacuum an inkjet. Inkjets generally do not have mainte-
nance kits, but most inkjet printers come with extensive
maintenance software (Figure 15.25). Usually, the hardest
part of using this software is finding it in the first place. Look
for an option in Printing Preferences, a selection on the Start
menu, or an icon on your desktop. Don’t worry—it’s there!
When you first set up an inkjet printer, it normally in-
structs you to perform a routine to align the printheads
properly, wherein you print out a page and select from sets
of numbered lines. If this isn’t done, the print quality will
show it, but the good news is that you can perform this pro-
cedure at any time. If a printer is moved or dropped or it’s
just been working away untended for a while, it’s often
worth running the alignment routine.
Inkjet Problems
Did I say that you never should clean an inkjet? Well, that may be true for
the printer itself, but there is one part of your printer that will benefit from
an occasional cleaning: the inkjet’s printer head nozzles. The nozzles are the
tiny pipes that squirt the ink onto the paper. A common problem with inkjet
printers is the tendency for the ink inside the nozzles to dry out when not
used even for a relatively short time, blocking any ink from exiting. If your
printer is telling Windows that it’s printing and it’s feeding paper through,
but either nothing is coming out (usually the case if you’re just printing
black text), or only certain colors are printing, the culprit is almost certainly
dried ink clogging the nozzles.
Every inkjet has a different procedure for cleaning the printhead noz-
zles. On older inkjets, you usually have to press buttons on the printer to
start a maintenance program. On more modern inkjets, you can access the
head-cleaning maintenance program from Windows.
Another problem that sometimes arises is the dreaded multi-sheet paper
grab. This is often not actually your printer’s fault—humidity can cause
sheets of paper to cling to each other—but sometimes the culprit is an over-
heated printer, so if you’ve been cranking out a lot of documents without
stopping, try giving the printer a bit of a coffee break. Also, fan the sheets of
the paper stack before inserting it into the paper tray.
Finally, in the maintenance area where the printheads park is usually a
small tank or tray to catch excess ink from the cleaning process. If the printer
has one, check to see how full it is. If this tray overflows onto the main board
or even the power supply, it will kill your printer. If you discover that it’s
about to overflow, you can remove excess ink by inserting a twisted paper
towel into the tank to soak up some of the ink. It is advisable to wear latex or

All inkjet inks are water-
based, so water works better
than alcohol to clean them up.
Cleaning the heads on an
inkjet printer is sometimes nec-
essary, but I don’t recommend
that you do it on a regular basis
as preventive maintenance. The
head-cleaning process uses up a
lot of that very expensive inkjet
ink—so do this only when a
printing problem seems to indi-
cate clogged or dirty print

vinyl gloves while doing this. Clean up any spilled ink with a paper towel
dampened with distilled water.
Troubleshooting Laser Printers
Quite a few problems can arise with laser printers, but before getting into
those details, you need to review some recommended procedures for avoid-
ing those problems.
Laser Printer Maintenance
Unlike PC maintenance, laser printer maintenance follows a fairly well es-
tablished procedure. Follow these steps to ensure a long, healthy life for
your system.
Keep It Clean
Laser printers are quite robust as a rule. A good cleaning
every time you replace the toner cartridge will help that printer last for
many years. I know of many examples of original HP LaserJet I printers
continuing to run perfectly after a dozen or more years of operation. The
secret is that they were kept immaculately clean.
Your laser printer gets dirty in two ways: Excess toner, over time, will
slowly coat the entire printer. Paper dust, sometimes called paper dander,
tends to build up where the paper is bent around rollers or where pickup
rollers grab paper. Unlike (black) toner, paper dust is easy to see and is usu-
ally a good indicator that a printer needs to be cleaned. Usually, a thorough
cleaning using a can of pressurized air to blow out the printer
is the best cleaning you can do. It’s best to do this outdoors, or
you may end up looking like one of those chimney sweeps
from Mary Poppins! If you must clean a printer indoors, use a
special low-static vacuum designed especially for electronic
components (Figure 15.26).
Every laser printer has its own unique cleaning method,
but one little area tends to be skipped in the included clean-
ing instructions. Every laser printer has a number of rubber
guide rollers through which the paper is run during the print
process. These little rollers tend to pick up dirt and paper
dust over time, making them slip and jam paper. They are
easily cleaned with a small amount of 90 percent or better al-
cohol on a fibrous cleaning towel. The alcohol will remove
the debris and any dead rubber. You can also give the rollers
and separator pads a textured surface that will restore their feeding proper-
ties by rubbing them with a little alcohol on a non-metallic scouring pad.
If you’re ready to get specific, get the printer’s service manual. Almost
every printer manufacturer sells these; they are a key source for information
on how to keep a printer clean and running. Sadly, not all printer manufac-
turers provide these, but most do. While you’re at it, see if the manufacturer
has a Quick Reference Guide; these can be very handy for most printer
problems!
Finally, be aware that Hewlett Packard sells maintenance kits for most
of its laser printers. These are sets of replacement parts for the parts most
likely to wear out on each particular type of HP LaserJet. Although their use

Before you service a laser
printer, always, always turn it off
and unplug it! Don’t expose
yourself to the very dangerous
high voltages found inside these
machines.

is not required to maintain warranty coverage, using these kits when pre-
scribed by HP helps to assure the continuing reliability of your LaserJet.
Periodic Maintenance
Although keeping the printer clean is critical to its
health and well being, every laser printer has certain components that will
need to be replaced periodically. Your ultimate source for determining the
parts that need to be replaced (and when to replace them) is the printer
manufacturer. Following the manufacturer’s maintenance guidelines will
help to ensure years of trouble-free, dependable printing from your laser
printer.
Some ozone filters may be cleaned with a vacuum and some can only be
replaced—follow the manufacturer’s recommendation. The fuser assembly
may be cleaned with 90 percent or better denatured alcohol. Check the heat
roller (the Teflon coated one with the light bulb inside) for pits and
scratches. If you see surface damage on the rollers, replace the fuser unit.
Most printers will give you an error code when the fuser is damaged or
overheating and needs to be replaced; others will produce the error code at a
preset copy count as a preventive maintenance measure. Again, follow the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
The transfer corona can be cleaned with a 90 percent denatured alcohol
solution on a cotton swab. If the wire is broken, you can replace it; many just
snap in or are held in by a couple of screws. Paper guides can also be cleaned
with alcohol on a fibrous towel.
Laser Printer Problems
Laser printers usually manifest problems by creating poor output. One of
the most important tests you can do on any printer, not just a laser printer, is
called a diagnostic print page or an engine test page. This is done by either hold-
ing down the On Line button as the printer is started or using the printer’s
maintenance software.
Blank Paper
Blank sheets of paper usually mean the printer is out of toner.
If the printer does have toner and nothing prints, print a diagnostic print
page. If that is also blank, remove the toner cartridge and look at the
imaging drum inside. If the image is still there, you know the transfer
corona or the high-voltage power supply has failed. Check the printer’s
maintenance guide to see how to focus on the bad part and replace it.
Dirty Printouts
If the fusing mechanism gets dirty in a laser printer, it will
leave a light dusting of toner all over the paper, particularly on the back of
the page. When you see toner speckles on your printouts, you should get the
printer cleaned.
Ghosting
Ghost images sometimes appear at regular intervals on the
printed page. This can be caused either because the imaging drum has not
fully discharged (and is picking up toner from a previous image) or because
a previous image has used up so much toner that either the supply of
charged toner is insufficient or the toner has not been adequately charged.
Sometimes it can also be caused by a worn-out cleaning blade that isn’t
removing the toner from the drum.
340
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
Failure of the thermal fuse
(used to keep the fuser from
overheating) can necessitate re-
placing the fuser assembly.
Some machines contain more
than one thermal fuse. As al-
ways, follow the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Many manu-
facturers have kits that alert you
to replace the fuser unit and key
rollers and guides at predeter-
mined page counts with an
alarm code.
The fuser assembly operates
at 200 to 300 degrees Fahren-
heit, so always allow time for
this component to cool down
before you attempt to clean it.

Light Ghosting versus Dark Ghosting
A variety of problems can cause both
light and dark ghosting, but the most common source of light ghosting is
“developer starvation.” If you ask a laser printer to print an extremely dark
or complex image, it can use up so much toner that the toner cartridge will
not be able to charge enough toner to print the next image. The proper
solution is to use less toner. You can fix ghosting problems in the following
ways:
■
Lower the resolution of the page (print at 300 dpi instead of 600 dpi).
■
Use a different pattern.
■
Avoid 50 percent grayscale and “dot-on/dot-off patterns.”
■
Change the layout so that grayscale patterns do not follow
black areas.
■
Make dark patterns lighter and light patterns darker.
■
Print in landscape orientation.
■
Adjust print density and RET settings.
■
Print a completely blank page immediately prior to the page with
the ghosting image, as part of the same print job.
In addition to these possibilities, low temperature and low humidity can
aggravate ghosting problems. Check your users’ manual for environmental
recommendations. Dark ghosting can sometimes be caused by a damaged
drum. It may be fixed by replacing the toner cartridge. Light ghosting
would not be solved in this way. Switching other components will not usu-
ally affect ghosting problems because they are a side effect of the entire
printing process.
Vertical White Lines
Vertical white lines are usually due to a clogged
toner preventing the proper dispersion of toner on the drum. Try shaking
the toner cartridge to dislodge the clog. If that doesn’t work, replace the
toner cartridge.
Blotchy Print
This is most commonly due to uneven dispersion of toner,
especially if the toner is low. Try shaking the toner from side to side and
then try to print. Also be sure that the printer is sitting level. Finally, make
sure the paper is not wet in spots. If the blotches are in a regular order, check
the fusing rollers and the photosensitive drum for any foreign objects.
Spotty Print
If the spots appear at regular intervals, the drum may be
damaged or some toner may be stuck to the fuser rollers. Try wiping off the
fuser rollers. Check the drum for damage. If the drum is damaged, get a new
toner cartridge.
Embossed Effect
If your prints are getting an embossed effect (like putting
a penny under a piece of paper and rubbing it with a lead pencil), there is
almost certainly a foreign object on a roller. Use 90 percent denatured
alcohol or regular water with a soft cloth to try to remove it. If the foreign
object is on the photosensitive drum, you’re going to have to use a new toner
cartridge. An embossed effect can also be caused by the contrast control
being set too high. The contrast control is actually a knob on the inside of the
Chapter 15: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Printers
341

unit (sometimes accessible from the outside, on older models). Check your
manual for the specific location.
Incomplete Characters
Incompletely printed characters on laser-printed
transparencies can sometimes be corrected by adjusting the print density.
Be extremely careful to use only materials approved for use in laser printers.
Creased Pages
Laser printers have up to four rollers. In addition to the heat
and pressure rollers of the fuser assembly, other rollers move the paper
from the source tray to the output tray. These rollers crease the paper to
avoid curling that would cause paper jams in the printer. If the creases are
noticeable, try using a different paper type. Cotton bond paper is usually
more susceptible to noticeable creasing than other bonds. You might also try
sending the output to the face-up tray, which avoids one roller. There is no
hardware solution to this problem; it is simply a side effect of the process.
Paper Jams
Every printer jams now and then. If you get a jam, always refer
first to the manufacturer’s jam removal procedure. It is simply too easy to
damage a printer by pulling on the jammed paper! If the printer reports a
jam but there’s no paper inside, you’ve almost certainly got a problem with
one of the many jam sensors or paper feed sensors inside the printer, and
you’ll need to take it to a repair center.
Pulling Multiple Sheets
If the printer grabs multiple sheets at a time, first
try opening a new ream of paper and loading that in the printer. If that
works, you’ve got a humidity problem. If the new paper angle doesn’t work,
check the separation pad on the printer. The separation pad is a small piece
of cork or rubber that separates the sheets as they are pulled from the paper
feed tray. A worn separation pad will look shiny and, well, worn! Most
separation pads are easy to replace. Check out www.printerworks .com to
see if you can replace yours.
Warped, Overprinted, or Poorly Formed Characters
Poorly formed charac-
ters can indicate either a problem with the paper (or other media) or a
problem with the hardware.
Incorrect media cause a number of these types of problems. Avoid paper
that is too rough or too smooth. Paper that is too rough interferes with the
fusing of characters and their initial definition. If the paper is too smooth
(like some coated papers, for example), it may feed improperly, causing dis-
torted or overwritten characters. Even though you can purchase laser
printer–specific paper, all laser printers will print acceptably on standard
photocopy paper. Try to keep the paper from becoming too wet. Don’t open
a ream of paper until it is loaded into the printer. Always fan the paper be-
fore loading it into the printer, especially if the paper has been left out of the
package for more than just a few days.
The durability of a well-maintained laser printer makes hardware a
much rarer source of character printing problems, but you should be aware
of the possibility. Fortunately, it is fairly easy to check the hardware. Most
laser printers have a self-test function—often combined with a diagnostic
printout but sometimes as a separate process. This self-test shows whether
the laser printer can properly develop an image without actually having to
send print commands from the PC. The self-test is quite handy to verify the
342
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

question, “Is it the printer or is it the computer?” Run the self-test to check
for connectivity and configuration problems.
Possible solutions include replacing the toner cartridge, especially if you
hear popping noises; checking the cabling; and replacing the data cable, es-
pecially if it has bends or crimps, or if objects are resting on the cable. If you
have a front menu panel, turn off advanced functions and high-speed set-
tings to determine whether the advanced functions are either not working
properly or not supported by your current software configuration (check
your manuals for configuration information). If these solutions do not work,
the problem may not be user serviceable. Contact an authorized service
center.
Beyond A+
DOT4
The IEEE 1284.4 standard, commonly known as DOT4, was created for
multifunction peripherals (MFPs)—those nifty gadgets that combine the
functions of printer, fax, and scanner in one big piece of equipment. The
DOT4 protocol enables the individual devices within the MFP to send and
receive multiple data packets simultaneously across a single physical chan-
nel. All data exchanges are independent of one another, so you can cancel
one—for example, a print job—without affecting the others. DOT4 is an en-
hancement of the IEEE 1284 protocol for parallel printing; look for products
that use it the next time you find yourself in a computer superstore.

Chapter 15 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
aspects of printers.
Printer Technologies
■
Impact printers create an image on paper by
physically striking an ink ribbon against the
paper’s surface. The most commonly-used impact
printer technology is dot matrix. Dot-matrix
printers have a large installed base in businesses,
and they can be used for multipart forms because
they actually strike the paper. Dot-matrix printers
use a grid, or matrix, of tiny pins, also known as
printwires, to strike an inked printer ribbon and
produce images on paper. The case that holds the
printwires is called a printhead. Dot-matrix
printers come in two varieties: 9-pin (draft quality)
and 24-pin (letter quality).
■
Inkjet printers include a printhead mechanism,
support electronics, a transfer mechanism to move
the printhead back and forth, and a paper feed
component to drag, move, and eject paper. They
eject ink through tiny tubes. The heat or pressure
used to move the ink is created by tiny resistors or
electroconductive plates at the end of each tube.
■
Ink is stored in ink cartridges. Older color printers
used two cartridges: one for black and one for
cyan, magenta, and yellow. Newer printers come
with four, six, eight, or more cartridges.
■
The quality of a print image is called the print
resolution. The resolution is measured in dots per
inch (dpi), which has two values: horizontal and
vertical (for example, 600 × 600 dpi). Printing
speed is measured in pages per minute (ppm).
Modern inkjet printers can print on a variety of
media, including glossy photo paper, optical discs,
or fabric.
■
Dye-sublimation printers are used to achieve
excellent print quality, especially in color, but
they’re expensive. Documents printed through the
dye-sublimation process display continuous tone
images, meaning that each pixel dot is a blend of
the different dye colors. This is in contrast to other
print technologies’ dithered images, which use
closely packed, single-color dots to simulate
blended colors.
■
Two kinds of thermal printers create either quick,
one-color printouts (direct thermal), such as faxes
or store receipts, or higher-quality (thermal wax
transfer) color prints.
■
Using a process called electro-photographic
imaging, laser printers produce high-quality and
high-speed output. Laser printers usually use lasers
as a light source because of their precision, but some
lower-cost printers may use LED arrays instead. The
toner cartridge in a laser printer supplies the toner
that creates the image on the page; many other laser
printer parts, especially those that suffer the most
wear and tear, have been incorporated into the toner
cartridge. Although the majority of laser printers are
monochrome, you can find color laser printers
capable of printing photographs.
■
Be aware of the cost of consumables when
purchasing a printer. Some less expensive printers
may seem like a good deal, but ink or toner cartridge
replacements can cost as much as the entire printer.
■
The photosensitive drum in a laser printer is an
aluminum cylinder coated with particles of
photosensitive compounds. The erase lamp exposes
the entire surface of the photosensitive drum to
light, making the photosensitive coating conductive
and leaving the surface particles electrically neutral.
When the primary corona is charged with an
extremely high voltage, an electric field (or corona)
forms, enabling voltage to pass to the drum and
charge the photosensitive particles on its surface; the
surface of the drum receives a uniform negative
voltage of between ~600 and ~1000 volts.
■
The laser acts as the writing mechanism of the
printer. When particles are struck by the laser, they
are discharged and left with a ~100-volt negative
charge. The toner in a laser printer is a fine powder
made up of plastic particles bonded to iron particles.
The toner cylinder charges the toner with a negative
charge of between ~200 and ~500 volts. Because that
charge falls between the original uniform negative
charge of the photosensitive drum (~600 to ~1000
volts) and the charge of the particles on the drum’s
344
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

surface hit by the laser (~100 volts), particles of
toner are attracted to the areas of the photosensitive
drum that have been hit by the laser. The transfer
corona applies a positive charge to the paper,
drawing the negatively charged toner particles on
the drum to the paper. A static charge eliminator
removes the paper’s static charge. Two rollers, a
pressure roller and a heated roller, are used to fuse
the toner to the paper.
■
All laser printers have at least two separate power
supplies. The primary power supply, which may
actually be more than one power supply, provides
power to the motors that move the paper, the
system electronics, the laser, and the transfer corona.
The high-voltage power supply usually only
provides power to the primary corona; it is one of
the most dangerous devices in the world of PCs.
Always unplug a laser printer before opening it up.
■
A laser printer’s mechanical functions are served
by complex gear systems packed together in
discrete units, generically called gear packs or
gearboxes. Most laser printers have two or three.
Every laser printer has sensors that detect a broad
range of conditions such as paper jams, empty
paper trays, or low toner levels.
■
Every laser printer contains at least one electronic
system board (many have two or three) that
contains the main processor, the printer’s ROM,
and RAM used to store the image before it is
printed. When the printer doesn’t have enough
RAM to store the image before it prints, you get a
memory overflow problem. Most printers can use
generic DRAM like the kind you use in your PC,
but check with the manufacturer to be sure.
■
Because even tiny concentrations of ozone (O3) will
cause damage to printer components, most laser
printers have a special ozone filter that needs to be
vacuumed or replaced periodically.
■
Solid ink printers use sticks of solid ink to produce
extremely vibrant color. The ink is melted and
absorbed into the paper fibers, and then it solidifies,
producing continuous tone output in a single pass.
■
ASCII contains a variety of control codes for
transferring data, some of which can be used to
control printers; ASCII code 10 (or 0A in hex)
means “Line Feed,” and ASCII code 12 (0C) means
“Form Feed.” These commands have been
standard since before the creation of IBM PCs, and
all printers respond to them; however, the control
codes are extremely limited. Utilizing high-end
graphics and a wide variety of fonts requires more
advanced languages.
■
Adobe Systems’ PostScript page description
language is a device-independent printer language
capable of high-resolution graphics and scalable
fonts. PostScript is understood by printers at a
hardware level, so the majority of the image
processing is done by the printer, not the PC’s
CPU—so PostScript printers print fast. PostScript
defines the page as a single raster image; this
makes PostScript files extremely portable.
■
Hewlett Packard’s printer control language (PCL)
features a set of printer commands greatly
expanded from ASCII, but it does not support
advanced graphical functions. PCL6 features
scalable fonts and additional line drawing
commands. PCL uses a series of commands to
define the characters on the page, rather than
defining the page as a single raster image.
■
Windows 2000/XP use the graphical device
interface (GDI) component of the operating system
to handle print functions. The GDI uses the CPU
rather than the printer to process a print job and
then sends the completed job to the printer. As
long as the printer has a capable-enough raster
image processor (RIP) and plenty of RAM, you
don’t need to worry about the printer language at
all in most situations.
■
Most printers connect to one of two ports on the
PC: a DB-25 parallel port or a USB port. The
parallel connection is the classic way to plug in a
printer, but most new printers use USB. The
parallel port was included in the original IBM PC
as a faster alternative to serial communication, and
has been kept around for backward compatibility.
Parallel ports are slow by modern standards, with
a maximum data transfer rate of 150 KBps. Parallel
ports lack true bidirectional capability. A standard
parallel connection usually consists of a female
DB-25 connector on the PC and a corresponding
male connector on the printer cable. Eight wires are
used as grounds, four for control signals, five for
status signals, and eight for data signals going
from the PC to the device. The parallel connector
on the printer side is called a Centronics connector.
■
IEEE 1284 was developed as a standard for a
backward-compatible, high-speed, bidirectional
parallel port for the PC. It requires support for
Chapter 15: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Printers
345

compatibility mode, nibble mode, byte mode, EPP,
and ECP; a standard method of negotiating
compatible modes between printer and PC;
standard cables and connectors; and a standard
electrical interface.
■
USB is the most popular type of printer connection
today. USB printers rarely come with the necessary
USB cable, so you may need to purchase one at the
same time you purchase the printer. FireWire
printers are less prevalent than USB, but offer easy
connectivity, high speed, and hot-swapping
capability.
■
Network printers come with their own network card
and connect directly to a network. This can be an
RJ-45 port for an actual cable, or a wireless network
card. Some printers offer Bluetooth adapters for
networking. To connect a printer with a network
card directly to a network, use a print server.
The Laser Printing Process
■
Laser printing is a six-step process: clean, charge,
write, develop, transfer, and fuse.
■
The printing process begins with the physical and
electrical cleaning of the photosensitive drum. All
residual toner left over from printing the previous
page must be removed, usually by scraping the
surface of the drum with a rubber cleaning blade.
One or more erase lamps bombard the surface of
the drum with the appropriate wavelengths of
light, causing the surface particles to discharge
completely into the grounded drum.
■
Using the primary corona wire, a uniform negative
charge is applied to the entire surface of the drum
(usually between ~600 and ~1000 volts) to make
the drum receptive to new images. A laser is used
to write a positive image relative to the toner
particles on the surface of the drum, attracting
them and creating a developed image. The transfer
corona gives the paper a positive charge, making
the negatively charged toner particles leap from
the drum to the paper. Two rollers, a heated roller
coated in a nonstick material and a pressure roller,
melt the toner to the paper, permanently affixing it.
Finally, a static charge eliminator removes the
paper’s positive charge.
■
Laser printers generate a pattern of dots, called a
raster image, representing what each page should
look like. Laser printers use the laser to “paint” the
raster image on the photosensitive drum. Laser
printers use a chip called the RIP to translate the
raster image sent to the printer into commands to
the laser.
■
Laser printer resolution is expressed in dpi.
Common resolutions are 600 dpi × 600 dpi or
1200 dpi × 1200 dpi. The first number, the
horizontal resolution, is determined by how fine
a focus can be achieved by the laser. The second
number is determined by the smallest increment by
which the drum can be turned. Higher resolutions
produce higher-quality output, but also require
more memory. Even printing at 300 dpi, laser
printers produce far better quality than dot-matrix
printers because RET enables the printer to insert
smaller dots among the characters, smoothing out
the jagged curves that are typical of printers that
do not use RET.
Installing a Printer in Windows
■
In Windows 2000/XP, a “printer” is not a physical
device; it is a program that controls one or more
physical printers. The physical printer is called a
“print device.” Print drivers and a spooler are still
present, but in 2000 and XP they are integrated into
the “printer” itself.
■
Select Start | Printers and Faxes in Windows XP to
open the Printers applet; in Windows 2000, select
Start | Settings | Printers. The icon for this applet
can also be found in the Control Panel. Install a
new printer by clicking the Add Printer icon to
start the Add Printer wizard. You must choose to
install a local or a network printer; and you must
select a port for a local printer. You must specify
the printer type from the wizard’s list, or using the
Have Disk option. Windows XP’s applet features a
Windows Update button that gets the latest printer
driver from the Internet.
■
One printer will always be the default printer. If
you have more than one printer installed, you can
make any printer the default printer. The icon for
the default printer will have a small check mark in
the corner. If you have multiple printers, you can
change the default printer by selecting the printer’s
properties and checking Make Default Printer.
■
Printer emulation means using a substitute printer
driver for a printer, as opposed to one made
exclusively for that printer. Some printers are
designed to emulate other, more widely supported
models. If you don’t have the specific driver for a
346
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

printer, you can often use the driver from a similar
model.
■
Your monitor creates colors using RGB, whereas a
printer outputs in CMYK. This difference can lead
to a printed page differing greatly in color and tone
from what is seen on the monitor. Calibrating your
monitor to your printer is an important step in
printing the colors you see on your screen.
Manually calibrate your monitor by eyeballing it,
use ICC color profiles to instruct the printer to
output colors a certain way, or use calibration
hardware and software to automate the process.
Troubleshooting Printer Problems
■
When troubleshooting a printer, first check all the
obvious possibilities. Is the printer on? Is it
connected? Is it online? Does it have paper? Then
check the spooler status either by double-clicking
the printer’s icon in the Printers applet, or by
double-clicking the tiny printer icon in the
notification area, if it’s present. You may be able to
bypass spooler problems by changing the printer
properties setting to print directly to the printer.
■
A print job that comes out a strange size usually points
to a user mistake in setting up the print job. Use the
program’s Page Setup feature to fix these problems. If
you know the page is set up correctly, recheck the
printer drivers. Misaligned or garbage printouts
invariably point to a corrupted or incorrect driver.
■
Printer manufacturers supply an MSDS for each of
their products; these provide detailed information
about the potential environmental hazards
associated with different components and proper
disposal methods.
■
Turn on the laser printer first and allow it to finish
its warm-up before turning on the PC (a reverse
power-up). This avoids having two devices
drawing their peak loads simultaneously.
■
With regular maintenance, impact printers will run
forever. White bars going through the text point to
a dirty or damaged printhead. Try cleaning the
printhead with 90 percent or better denatured
alcohol. If the characters look chopped off at the
top or bottom, the printhead probably needs to be
adjusted.
■
Inkjet printers generally have built-in maintenance
programs that you should run from time to time
to keep your inkjet in good operating order. A
common problem with inkjet printers is the
tendency for the ink inside the nozzles to dry out
when not used even for a relatively short time,
blocking any ink from exiting. To clean the nozzles
on older inkjets, you usually have to press buttons
on the printer to start a maintenance program. On
more modern inkjets, you can access the head-
cleaning maintenance program from Windows.
■
One of the most important tests you can do on any
printer, not just a laser printer, is called a diagnostic
print page or an engine test page. There are two
types of printer test: the Windows test in which you
print a test page, and the printer self-test that runs
from the printer itself.
■
Over time, excess toner will slowly coat the entire
printer. Paper dander will build up where the paper
is bent around rollers or where pickup rollers grab
paper. Use a small amount of 90 percent or better
alcohol on a fibrous cleaning towel to remove the
debris and any dead rubber.
■
Blank sheets of paper usually mean the printer is
out of toner. If the printer has toner and nothing
prints, print a diagnostic print page. If that is also
blank, remove the toner cartridge and look at the
imaging drum inside. If the image is still there, you
know the transfer corona or the high-voltage
power supply has failed. Blotchy print is most
commonly due to uneven dispersion of toner,
especially if the toner is low; also check that the
printer is level and the paper completely dry.
■
Ghost images can be caused either because the
imaging drum has not fully discharged (and is
picking up toner from a previous image) or
because a previous image has used up so much
toner that either the supply of charged toner is
insufficient or the toner has not been adequately
charged. Dark ghosting can sometimes be caused
by a damaged drum. It may be fixed by replacing
the toner cartridge. Light ghosting would not be
solved in this way.
■
The rollers that move the paper from the source
tray to the output tray crease the paper in order to
avoid curling that would cause paper jams in the
printer. If the creases are noticeable, try using a
different paper type. If the printer reports a jam but
there’s no paper inside, you’ve almost certainly got
a problem with one of the many jam sensors or
paper feed sensors. If the printer grabs multiple
sheets at a time, the problem may be humidity or a
worn separation pad.

ireless networking is one of the topics with a blurry line between
CompTIA’s Essentials and IT Technician exams. Although wireless is
most certainly covered in the Essentials exam, CompTIA has placed most of the
heavy lifting in the IT Technician exam. If you consider the depth of networking
covered in the Essentials exam, this might just be a reflection of CompTIA
wanting to spread out the learning a bit more between the two exams. In either
case, this chapter really covers two main topics: the installation and
configuration of wireless networks and the maintenance and troubleshooting of
all types of networks.

■Installing and Configuring
a Wireless Network
Wireless networks represent the newest (and to me, one of the coolest)
things happening in networking today. The chance to get away from all the
cables and mess and just connect has a phenomenal appeal. Because I see
wireless as one of the most important areas of development in the PC, this
352
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

section goes a good bit deeper into the technology than the CompTIA A+
exams require. A highly skilled tech today should know this stuff, because
that’s what your customers will demand. To make it a little easier to study,
I’ve included some exam tips in this section that you can skim before taking
the exams.
Instead of a physical set of wires running between network nodes, wire-
less networks use either radio waves or beams of infrared light to communi-
cate with each other. Different kinds of wireless networking solutions have
come and gone in the past. The types of wireless radio wave networks you’ll
find yourself supporting these days are those based on the IEEE 802.11 wire-
less Ethernet standard Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi)—and those based on
Bluetooth technology. Wireless networks using infrared light are limited to
those that use the Infrared Data Association (IrDA) protocol. Finally, the cell
phone companies have gotten into the mix and offer access to the Internet
through cellular networks. (More on each technology later in the chapter.)
Wireless Networking Components
Wireless networking capabilities of one form or another are built into many
modern computing devices. Infrared transceiver ports have been standard is-
sue on portable computers, PDAs, and high-end printers for years, although
they’re curiously absent from many of the latest PCs. Figure 16.1 shows the
infrared transceiver ports on a laptop computer and a PDA. Wireless Ethernet
and Bluetooth capabilities are increasingly popular as integrated compo-
nents, or they can easily be added using USB, PCI, PCI Express, or PC Card
adapters. Figure 16.2 shows a PCI card that accepts a wireless PC Card
Ethernet card. You can also add wireless network capabilities using external
USB wireless network adapters, as shown in Figure 16.3.
Wireless network adapters aren’t limited to PCs. Many handheld com-
puters and PDAs have wireless capabilities built-in or available as add-on
options. Figure 16.4 shows a PDA accessing the Internet through a wireless
network adapter card.
To extend the capabilities of a wireless Ethernet network, such as con-
necting to a wired network or sharing a high-speed Internet connection, you
need a wireless access point (WAP) . A WAP centrally connects wireless

network nodes in the same way that a hub connects wired Ethernet PCs.
Many WAPs also act as switches and Internet routers, such as the Linksys
device shown in Figure 16.5.
Wireless communication via Bluetooth comes as a built-in option on
newer PCs and peripheral devices, or you can add it to an older PC via an
external USB Bluetooth adapter. Figure 16.6 shows a Bluetooth adapter with
a Bluetooth-enabled mouse and keyboard.
Wireless Networking Software
Wireless devices use the same networking protocols and client that their
wired counterparts use, and they operate using the CSMA/CA networking
scheme. The CA stands for collision avoidance, a slightly different standard
354

than the collision detection standard used in wired Ethernet. Here’s the differ-
ence. Wireless nodes listen in on the wireless medium to see if another node
is currently broadcasting data. If so, it waits a random amount of time before
retrying. So far, this method is exactly the same as the method used by wired
Ethernet networks. Because wireless nodes have a more difficult time de-
tecting data collisions, however, they offer the option of using the Request to
Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) protocol. When enabled, a transmitting node
that determines that the wireless medium is clear to use sends an RTS
frame to the receiving node. The receiving node responds with a CTS frame,
telling the sending node that it’s okay to transmit. Then, once the data is
sent, the transmitting node waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the
receiving node before sending the next data packet. Very elegant, but keep
in mind that using RTS/CTS introduces significant overhead to the process
and can impede performance.
In terms of configuring wireless networking software, you need to do
very little. Wireless network adapters are plug and play, so any modern ver-
sion of Windows will immediately recognize a wireless network adapter
when it is installed into a PCI or PC Card slot, or a USB port, prompting you
to load any needed hardware drivers. You will, however, need a utility to
set parameters such as the network name.
Windows XP has built-in tools for configuring these settings, but for pre-
vious versions of Windows, you need to rely on configuration tools pro-
vided by the wireless network adapter vendor. Figure 16.7 shows a typical
wireless network adapter configuration util-
ity. Using this utility, you can determine
your link state and signal strength, config-
ure your wireless networking mode (dis-
cussed next), and set security encryption,
power saving options, and so on.
Wireless Network Modes
The simplest wireless network consists of
two or more PCs communicating directly
with each other sans cabling or any other in-
termediary hardware. More complicated
wireless networks use a WAP to centralize
wireless communication and bridge wire-
less network segments to wired network
segments. These two different methods are
called
ad-hoc
mode
and
infrastructure
mode.
Ad-hoc Mode
Ad-hoc
mode
is
sometimes
called
peer-to-peer mode, with each wireless node
in direct contact with each other node in a
decentralized free-for-all, as shown in Figure 16.8. Two or more wireless
nodes communicating in ad-hoc mode form what’s called an Independent Ba-
sic Service Set (IBSS). Ad-hoc mode networks are suited for small groups of

Wireless configuration utility

356
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
computers (less than a dozen or so) that need to transfer files or share print-
ers. Ad-hoc networks are also good for temporary networks such as study
groups or business meetings.
Infrastructure Mode
Wireless networks running in infrastructure mode use one or more WAPs to
connect the wireless network nodes to a wired network segment, as shown
in Figure 16.9. A single WAP servicing a given area is called a Basic Service
Set (BSS). This service area can be extended by adding more WAPs. This is
called, appropriately, an Extended Basic Service Set (EBSS).
• Figure 16.8
Wireless ad-hoc mode network
• Figure 16.9
Wireless infrastructure mode network

Chapter 16: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Networks
357
Wireless networks running in infrastructure mode require more plan-
ning and are more complicated to configure than ad-hoc mode networks,
but they also give you finer control over how the network operates. Infra-
structure mode is better suited to business networks or networks that need
to share dedicated resources such as Internet connections and centralized
databases. If you plan on setting up a wireless network for a large number of
PCs or need centralized control over the wireless network, infrastructure
mode is what you need.
Wireless Networking Security
One of the major complaints against wireless networking is that it offers
weak security. In many cases, the only thing you need to do to access a wire-
less network is walk into a WAP’s coverage area and turn on your wireless
device! Furthermore, data packets are floating through the air instead of
safely wrapped up inside network cabling. What’s to stop an unscrupulous
PC tech with the right equipment from grabbing those packets out of the air
and reading that data himself?
Wireless networks use three methods to secure access to the network it-
self and secure the data that’s being transferred. The Service Set Identifier
(SSID) parameter—also called the network name—is used to define the wire-
less network. This is very handy when you have a number of wireless net-
works in the same area!
SSID
One of the main security weaknesses with wireless networks is that, out of
the box, there’s no security configured at all. Wireless devices want to be
heard, and WAPs are usually configured to broadcast their presence to their
maximum range and welcome all other wireless devices that respond.
Always change the default SSID to something unique. Configuring a
unique SSID name is the very least that you should do to secure a wireless
network. The default SSID names are well known and widely available on-
line. This is intended to make setting up a wireless network as easy as possi-
ble, but conversely it creates a security hole you could drive a bullet train
through. Each wireless network node and access point needs to be config-
ured with the same unique SSID name. This SSID name is then included in
the header of every data packet broadcast in the wireless network’s cover-
age area. Data packets that lack the correct SSID name in the header are
rejected.
Another trick often seen in wireless networks is to tell the wireless de-
vice to not broadcast the SSID. This makes it harder for people not autho-
rized to access the network to know it’s there.
MAC Address Filtering
Most WAPs also support MAC address filtering , a method that enables you
to limit access to your wireless network based on the physical, hard-wired
address of the units’ wireless NIC. MAC address filtering is a handy way of
creating a type of “accepted users” list to limit access to your wireless
Changing the default SSID for
the WAP is the first step in set-
ting up a new wireless network.

network, but it works best when you have a small number of users. A table
stored in the WAP lists the MAC addresses that are permitted to participate
in the wireless network. Any data packets that don’t contain the MAC ad-
dress of a node listed in the table are rejected.
WEP
Early on, Wi-Fi developers introduced the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
protocol to attempt to ensure that data is secured while in transit over the
airwaves. WEP encryption uses a standard 40-bit encryption to scramble
data packets. Many vendors also support 104-bit encryption. Note that
some vendors advertise 128-bit encryption, but they actually use a 104-bit
encryption key. Unfortunately, WEP encryption includes a flaw that makes
it vulnerable to attack. While better than no encryption at all, keep in mind
that WEP will not keep out a determined and knowledgeable intruder.
One important note to consider is that WEP doesn’t provide complete
end-to-end encryption. WEP provides encryption only between the WAP
and the wireless device. Encryption is stripped from the data packet as it
travels “up” through the subsequent network layers. For true end-to-end
encryption, you need to upgrade to WPA or WPA2.
WPA
The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol addresses the weaknesses of
WEP and acts as a security protocol upgrade to WEP. WPA offers security
enhancements such as an encryption key integrity-checking feature and
user authentication through the industry-standard Extensible Authentication
Protocol (EAP). EAP provides a huge security improvement over WEP en-
cryption. After all, MAC addresses are fairly easy to “sniff” out, since
they’re transmitted in unencrypted, clear text format. User names and pass-
words are encrypted and therefore much more secure. Even with these en-
hancements, WPA was intended only as an interim security solution until
the IEEE 802.11i security standard was finalized and implemented.
WPA2
Recent versions of Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows XP Professional sup-
port the full IEEE 802.11i standard, more commonly known as Wi-Fi Pro-
tected Access 2 (WPA2) , to lock down wireless networks. WPA2 uses the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), among other improvements, to pro-
vide a secure wireless environment. If you haven’t upgraded to WPA2, you
should.
Speed and Range Issues
Wireless networking data throughput speeds depend on several factors.
Foremost is the standard that the wireless devices use. Depending on the
standard used, wireless throughput speeds range from a measly 2 Mbps to a
respectable 54 Mbps. One of the other factors affecting speed is the distance
between wireless nodes (or between wireless nodes and centralized access
Many techs shorten the term
“MAC address filtering” to sim-
ply “MAC filtering.” Either way
works.z

points). Wireless devices dynamically negotiate the top speed at which they
can communicate without dropping too many data packets. Speed de-
creases as distance increases, so the maximum throughput speed is
achieved only at extremely close range (less than 25 feet or so). At the outer
reaches of a device’s effective range, speed may decrease to around 1 Mbps
before it drops out altogether.
Speed is also affected by interference from other wireless devices operat-
ing in the same frequency range—such as cordless phones or baby moni-
tors—and by solid objects. So-called dead spots occur when something
capable of blocking the radio signal comes between the wireless network
nodes. Large electrical appliances such as refrigerators are very effective at
blocking a wireless network signal. Other culprits include electrical fuse
boxes, metal plumbing, air conditioning units, and similar objects.
Wireless networking range is difficult to define, and you’ll see most de-
scriptions listed with qualifiers, such as “around 150 feet” and “about 300
feet.” This is simply because, like throughput speed, range is greatly af-
fected by outside factors. Interference from other wireless devices affects
range, as does interference from solid objects. The maximum ranges listed in
the next section are those presented by wireless manufacturers as the theo-
retical maximum ranges. In the real world, you’ll experience these ranges
only under the most ideal circumstances. True effective range is probably
about half what you see listed.
Wireless Networking Standards
To help you gain a better understanding of wireless network technology,
here is a brief look at the standards that they use.
IEEE 802.11-Based Wireless Networking
The IEEE 802.11 wireless Ethernet standard, more commonly known as
Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) , defines methods by which devices may communi-
cate using spread-spectrum radio waves. Spread-spectrum broadcasts data in
small, discrete chunks over the different frequencies available within a cer-
tain frequency range. All of the 802.11-based wireless technologies broad-
cast and receive at 2.4 GHz (with the exception of 802.11a, which uses
5 GHz). The original 802.11 standard has been extended to 802.11a, 802.11b,
and 802.11g variations used in Wi-Fi wireless networks, and also hybridized
(combined with another wireless communication technology) to form the
Shared Wireless Access Protocol (SWAP) used in the now defunct HomeRF
networks.
Wireless devices can communicate only with other wireless devices that
use the same standard. The exception to this is 802.11g, which is backward
compatible with 802.11b devices (although at the lower speed of 802.11b).
The following paragraphs describe the important specifications of each of
the popular 802.11-based wireless networking standards.
802.11a
Despite the “a” designation for this extension to the 802.11
standard, 802.11a was actually developed after 802.11b. The 802.11a
standard differs from the other 802.11-based standards in significant ways.

You can see the speed and
signal strength on your wireless
network by looking at the Wire-
less NIC’s properties.
Tech Tip
Increasing Wireless
Range
Range can be increased in a couple
of ways. You can install multiple
WAPs to permit “roaming” be-
tween one WAP’s coverage area
and another’s—an EBSS. Or you
can install a signal booster that in-
creases a single WAP’s signal
strength, thus increasing its range.
Look for basic troubleshoot-
ing questions on the CompTIA
A+ certification exams dealing
with factors that affect wireless
connectivity, range, and speed.
Tech Tip
Spread-Spectrum
Broadcasting
The 802.11 standard defines two
different spread-spectrum broad-
casting methods: direct-sequence
spread-spectrum (DSSS) and
frequency-hopping spread-
spectrum (FHSS). DSSS sends
data out on different frequencies at
the same time, while FHSS sends
data on one frequency at a time,
constantly shifting (or hopping)
frequencies. DSSS uses consider-
ably more bandwidth than FHSS,
around 22 MHz as opposed to
1 MHz, respectively. DSSS is ca-
pable of greater data throughput,
but DSSS is more prone to interfer-
ence than FHSS. HomeRF wireless
networks were the only types that
used FHSS; all the other 802.11-
based wireless networking stan-
dards use DSSS.

Foremost is that it operates in a different frequency range, 5 GHz. This
means that devices that use this standard are less prone to interference from
other devices that use the same frequency range. 802.11a also offers
considerably greater throughput than 802.11 and 802.11b at speeds up to 54
Mbps, though its actual throughput is no more than 25 Mbps in normal
traffic conditions. While its theoretical range tops out at about 150 feet, in a
typical office environment, its maximum range will be lower. Despite the
superior speed of 802.11a, it isn’t widely adopted in the PC world.
802.11b
802.11b is practically ubiquitous in wireless networking. The
802.11b standard supports data throughput of up to 11 Mbps (with actual
throughput averaging 4 to 6 Mbps)—on par with older wired 10BaseT
networks—and a maximum range of 300 feet under ideal conditions. In a
typical office environment, its maximum range will be lower.
802.11b networks can be secured though the use of WEP and WPA en-
cryption. The main downside to using 802.11b is, in fact, that it’s the most
widely used standard. The 2.4-GHz frequency is already a crowded place,
so you’re likely to run into interference from other wireless devices.
802.11g
The latest standardized version of 802.11, 802.11g offers data
transfer speeds equivalent to 802.11a, up to 54 Mbps, with the wider
300-foot range of 802.11b. More important, 802.11g is backward compatible
with 802.11b, meaning that the same 802.11g WAP can service both 802.11b
and 802.11g wireless nodes.
Table 16.1 compares the important differences between the versions of
802.11.
Infrared Wireless Networking
Wireless networking using infrared technology is largely overlooked these
days, probably due to the explosion of interest in the newer and faster wire-
less standards. This is a shame, because infrared provides an easy way to
transfer data, often without the need to purchase or install any additional
hardware or software on your PCs.
Infrared Data Association Standard
Communication
through
infrared
devices is enabled via the Infrared Data Association (IrDA) protocol. The
IrDA protocol stack is a widely supported industry standard and has been
included in all versions of Windows since Windows 95.
Speed- and range-wise, infrared isn’t very impressive. Infrared devices
are capable of transferring data up to 4 Mbps—not too shabby, but hardly
stellar. The maximum distance between infrared devices is 1 meter. Infrared
links are direct line-of-sight and are susceptible to interference. An infrared
link can be disrupted by anything that breaks the beam of light—a badly
placed can of Mountain Dew, a co-worker passing between desks, or even
bright sunlight hitting the infrared transceiver can cause interference.
Infrared is designed to make a point-to-point connection between two de-
vices only in ad-hoc mode. No infrastructure mode is available. You can, how-
ever, use an infrared access point device to enable Ethernet network
communication using IrDA. Infrared devices operate at half-duplex, meaning
that while one is talking, the other is listening—they can’t talk and listen at the
same time. IrDA has a mode that emulates full-duplex communication, but it’s

Tech Tip
Wi-Fi Certification
Technically, only wireless devices
that conform to the extended ver-
sions of the 802.11 standard,
802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g, are
Wi-Fi certified. Wi-Fi certification
comes from the Wi-Fi Alliance (for-
merly the Wireless Ethernet Com-
patibility Alliance, or WECA), a
nonprofit industry group made up
of more than 175 member compa-
nies who design and manufacturer
wireless networking products.
Wi-Fi certification ensures compat-
ibility among wireless networking
devices made by different vendors.
First-generation devices that use
the older 802.11 standard are not
Wi-Fi certified and may or may not
work well with devices made by
different vendors.
Wi-Fi is by far the most
widely adopted wireless net-
working type today. Not only do
thousands of private businesses
and homes have wireless net-
works, but many public places
such as coffee shops and librar-
ies also offer Internet access
through wireless networks.
Tech Tip
The 802.11 Standard
Devices that use the original
802.11 (with no letter) standard are
a rarity these days. You’re likeliest
to find them in service on some
brave early wireless adopter’s net-
work. The original 802.11 standard
was hampered by both slow speeds
(2 Mbps maximum) and limited
range (about 150 feet). 802.11 em-
ployed some of the same features
that are in use in the current wire-
less standards. 802.11 uses the
2.4-GHz broadcast range, and se-
curity is provided by the use of in-
dustry-standard WEP and WPA
encryption.

really half-duplex. Security-wise, the IrDA protocol offers exactly nothing in
the way of encryption or authentication. Infrared’s main security feature is the
fact that you have to be literally within arm’s reach to establish a link. Clearly,
infrared is not the best solution for a dedicated network connection, but for a
quick file transfer or print job without getting your hands dirty, it’ll do in a
pinch.
Table 16.2 lists infrared’s important specifications.

what about the millions of older

many devices to support WP2
with a firmware upgrade or driver
update. You’ll also need to patch
earlier versions of Mac OS X and

supports WPA2 out of the box.

devices such as keyboards and mice, and even consumer electronics such as
cell phones, home stereos, televisions, home security systems, and so on.
Bluetooth is not designed to be a full-function networking solution, nor is it
meant to compete with Wi-Fi. If anything, Bluetooth is poised to replace in-
frared as a means to connect PCs to peripherals.
The IEEE organization has made Bluetooth the basis for its forthcoming
802.15 standard for wireless PANs. Bluetooth uses the FHSS spread-
spectrum broadcasting method, switching between any of the 79 frequen-
cies available in the 2.45-GHz range. Bluetooth hops frequencies some 1600
times per second, making it highly resistant to interference. It transfers data
from 723 Kbps to 1—count ’em, 1—Mbps, with a maximum range of 10 me-
ters (just over 30 feet). Some high-powered Bluetooth devices have through-
put speed of a whopping 2 Mbps and a maximum range of up to 300 feet,
but these are uncommon.
Bluetooth is not designed to be a full-fledged wireless networking solu-
tion. Bluetooth is made to replace the snake’s nest of cables that currently
connects most PCs to their various peripheral devices—keyboard, mouse,
printer, speakers, scanner, and the like—but you won’t be swapping out
your 802.11-based networking devices with Bluetooth-based replacements
anytime soon.
Having said that, Bluetooth-enabled wireless networking is comparable
to other wireless technologies in a few ways:
■
Like infrared, Bluetooth is acceptable for quick file transfers where a
wired connection (or a faster wireless connection) is unavailable.
■
Bluetooth’s speed and range make it a good match for wireless print
server solutions.
Bluetooth Wireless Networking Hardware
Bluetooth hardware comes either
integrated into many newer portable electronic gadgets such as PDAs and cell
phones or as an adapter added to an internal or external expansion bus.
Bluetooth networking is enabled through ad-hoc styled PC-to-PC (or PDA,
handheld computer, or cell phone–to-PC) connections, or in an infrastructure-
like mode through Bluetooth access points. Bluetooth access points are very
similar to 802.11-based access points, bridging wireless Bluetooth PAN
segments to wired LAN segments.
Cellular
Cellular wireless networks enable you to connect to the Internet through a
network-aware personal digital assistant (PDA) or cell phone. Figure 16.10
shows a higher-end cell phone with an Internet connection. Using an
add-on PC Card, you can connect any laptop to a cellular network as well.
Figure 16.11 shows a Sprint Mobile Broadband Card.
In areas with broad cell phone coverage, such as big cities, cellular wire-
less networks offer high-speed access (400 to 700 Kbps download speeds)
anywhere you go. Just fire up your device or portable and start surfing the
Web! In remote areas, the speed drops down to something closer to modem
connection speeds. (See Chapter 17, “The Internet,” for the scoop on
modems.)

Cellular networks use various protocols to connect,
such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM),
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA). These protocols are handled
seamlessly by the software and hardware. What the end
user sees is TCP/IP, just as if he or she connected through a
wired network.
About the only real downside to cellular wireless net-
works is the price. The cell phone companies (notably
Sprint and Cingular) are quite proud of their network ser-
vice. As the technology matures, competition among the
cellular network providers should bring the price down to
something affordable for many people. At this point,
though, it’s usually much more cost-effective to go to a cof-
fee shop or library and connect via Wi-Fi.
Configuring Wireless Networking
The mechanics of setting up a wireless network don’t differ much from a
wired network. Physically installing a wireless network adapter is the same
as installing a wired NIC, whether it’s an internal PCI card, a PC Card, or an
external USB device. Simply install the device and let plug and play handle
detection and resource allocation. Install the device’s supplied driver when
prompted, and you’re practically done. Unless you’re using Windows XP,
you also need to install the wireless network configuration utility supplied
with your wireless network adapter so that you can set your communication
mode, SSID, and so on.
As mentioned earlier, wireless devices want to talk to each other, so
communicating with an available wireless network is usually a no-brainer.
The trick is in configuring the wireless network so that only specific wire-
less nodes are able to use it and securing the data that’s being sent through
the air.
Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi networks support ad-hoc and infra-
structure operation modes. Which mode you
choose depends on the number of wireless
nodes you need to support, the type of data
sharing they’ll perform, and your manage-
ment requirements.
Ad-hoc Mode
Ad-hoc
wireless
networks
don’t need a WAP. The only requirements in
an ad-hoc mode wireless network are that
each wireless node be configured with the
same network name (SSID), and that no two
nodes use the same IP address. Figure 16.12
shows
a
wireless
network
configuration
utility with ad-hoc mode selected. Clicking
the Initiate Ad Hoc button on this particular
utility opened the Ad Hoc Setting dialog box
• Figure 16.12
Selecting ad-hoc mode in wireless configuration utility
• Figure 16.11
Cellular network card

where you can set the speed and the channel (if necessary.) Other utilities
have the options in different dialog boxes, but a quick glance should find the
same options.
The only other configuration steps to take are to make sure that no two
nodes are using the same IP address (this step is usually unnecessary if all
PCs are using DHCP) and to ensure that the File and Printer Sharing service
is running on all nodes.
Infrastructure Mode
Typically, infrastructure
mode wireless networks employ one or more
WAPs connected to a wired network segment,
a corporate intranet or the Internet, or both. As
with
ad-hoc
mode
wireless
networks,
infrastructure mode networks require that the
same SSID be configured on all nodes and
WAPs.
Figure
16.13
shows
the
same
NETGEAR Wi-Fi configuration screen, this
time set to infrastructure mode and using WPA
security.
WAPs have an integrated Web server and
are configured through a browser- based setup
utility. Typically, you fire up your Web
browser
on
one
of
your
network
client
workstations and enter the WAP’s default IP
address, such as 192.168.1.1, to bring up the
configuration page. You will need to supply an
administrative password, included with your
WAP’s documentation, to log in (see Figure 16.14). Setup screens vary from
vendor to vendor and from model to model. Figure 16.15 shows the initial
setup screen for a popular Linksys WAP/router.
Configure the SSID option where indicated. Channel selection is
usually automatic, but you can reconfigure this option if you have
particular needs in your organization (for example, if you have mul-
tiple wireless networks operating in the same area). Remember that
it’s always more secure to configure a unique SSID than it is to ac-
cept the well-known default one. You should also make sure that the
option to allow broadcasting of the SSID is disabled. This ensures
that only wireless nodes specifically configured with the correct
SSID can join the wireless network.
To increase security even more, use MAC filtering. Figure 16.16
shows the MAC filtering configuration screen on a Linksys WAP.
Simply enter the MAC address of a wireless node that you wish to
allow (or deny) access to your wireless network. Set up encryption
by turning encryption on at the WAP and then generating a unique security
key. Then configure all connected wireless nodes on the network with the
same key information. Figure 16.17 shows the WEP key configuration
dialog for a Linksys WAP.
You have the option of automatically generating a set of encryption keys
or doing it manually—save yourself a headache and use the automatic
method. Select an encryption level—the usual choices are either 64-bit or
364
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
As noted earlier in the chap-
ter, the WEP protocol provides
security, but it’s fairly easily
cracked. Use WPA2 or, if you
have older equipment, then set-
tle for WPA until you can
upgrade.

tion level, key, and passphrase
must match on the wireless client

vices dynamically, without user interaction. Typically, there’s nothing to

Set Up a Wireless Network
Getting a wireless network up and running can be fun, and it’s certainly
a useful skill to have, so Try This!
1.
Install wireless NICs in two or more PCs and then get them
chatting in ad-hoc mode. Don’t forget to change the SSID!
2.
Once you’ve got them talking in ad-hoc mode, add a WAP and
get them chatting in infrastructure mode.

configure on an infrared-equipped PC. Check your network set-
tings to ensure that you’ve got the IrDA protocol installed and
enabled, and you should be good to go (see Figure 16.19).
As far as infrared networking goes, your choices are some-
what limited. Infrared is designed to connect only two systems
in ad-hoc mode. This can be done simply to transfer files, or with
a bit more configuration, you can configure the two PCs to use
IrDA in direct-connection mode. You can also use a special infra-
red access point to enable Ethernet LAN access via IrDA.
Transferring Files via Infrared
File
transfers
via
IrDA
are
simple. When two IrDA-enabled devices “see” each other, the
sending (primary) device negotiates a connection to the
receiving (secondary) device, and voilà. It’s just “point and
shoot”! Figure 16.20 shows Windows 2000’s Wireless Link applet.
Use this to configure file transfer options and the default
location for received files. You can send a file over the infrared
connection by specifying a location and one or more files using
the Wireless Link dialog box; dragging and dropping files onto
the Wireless Link icon; right-clicking the file(s) in My Computer
and selecting Send To Infrared Recipient; or printing to a printer
configured to use an infrared port.
Networking via Infrared
Direct network connections between two PCs
using infrared are similar to using a null-modem cable to connect two PCs
together via a serial port. Modern versions of Windows make this type of
connection extremely easy by employing wizards. Simply select Connect
Directly to Another Computer and follow the prompts, choosing your
infrared port as the connection device.

■Troubleshooting Networks
Once you go beyond a single PC and enter the realm of networked comput-
ers, your troubleshooting skills need to take a giant leap up in quality. Think
of the complexity added with networks. Suddenly you have multiple PCs
with multiple users who could, at the drop of a hat, do all kinds of inadver-
tent damage to a fully functional PC. Networked PCs have a layer of net-
worked hardware and resource sharing that adds a completely new
dimension to a user’s cry for help, “I can’t print!”
Where can the problem lie in a non-networked situation if a person cannot
print? Here are the obvious ones:
■
Printer is not connected to the PC.
■
Printer is out of ink.
■
PC doesn’t have the proper driver loaded.
■
PC points by default to a printer other than the one to which the user
thinks should print.
That’s about it. Maybe the parallel port configuration is wrong in CMOS
or the USB drivers aren’t correct, but still.… Now do the same thing with a
networked situation where a user can’t print. Here are the obvious extra is-
sues, because all the local machine issues apply as well:
■
Print server is down.
■
Printer is locked by another user.
■
The client PC doesn’t have network connectivity.
■
The NIC driver is bad or incorrect.
■
The client PC doesn’t have the proper printer drivers installed for
the networked printer.
■
The cable between the client PC’s NIC and the nearest switch is bad.
■
The port to which the cable connects is bad.
■
The switch failed.
■
Somebody in an office down the hall spilled coffee on the printer
inside the mechanism and then didn’t fess up to the accident.
That’s a lot of variables, and they just scratch the surface of possibilities.
You live in a networked world—it’s time to elevate your troubleshooting
skills and methodologies to the next level. This section offers a series of steps
you can use when performing any type of PC or network troubleshooting.
You’ll look at ways to apply your tech skills and general communication
skills to get to the bottom of a problem and get that problem fixed.
Verify the Symptom
The one thing that all PC problems have in common is a symptom. If some-
thing odd wasn’t happening to users as they tried to do whatever they need
to do on their computers, you wouldn’t have a problem at all, would you?
Unfortunately, the vast majority of users out there aren’t CompTIA A+
Chapter 16: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Networks
369

certified technicians. As a tech, you need to overcome a rather nasty com-
munication gap before you can begin to consider a fix. Let’s bridge that gap
right now.
It usually starts with a phone call:
You: “Tech Support, this is Mike. How can I help you?”
User: “Uh, hi, Mike. This is Tom over in Accounting. I can’t get into
the network. Can you help me?”
Tom just started over in the Accounting department this week and has
been a pain in the rear end so far. Ah, the things you might want to say to
this person: “No. I only help non-pain-in-the-rear accountants.” Or how
about this? “Let me check my appointment schedule … ah, yes. I can check
on your problem in two weeks. Monday at 4:00 P.M. okay for you?”
But, of course, you had the audacity to choose the beloved profession of
IT tech support, so you don’t get to ask the questions you want to ask.
Rather, you need to take a position of leadership and get to the bottom of the
problem, and that means understanding the symptom. Take a deep breath,
smile, and get to work. You have two issues to deal with at this point. First, if
you’re working with a user, you must try to get the user to describe the
symptom. Second, whether you’re working on a system alone or you’re
talking to a user on the telephone, you must verify that the symptom is
legitimate.
Getting a user to describe a symptom is often a challenge. Users are not
techs and, as a result, their perception of the PC is very different than yours.
But by the same token, most users know a bit about PCs—you want to take
advantage of a user’s skill and experience whenever you can. A personal ex-
ample of verifying the symptom: Once I got a call from a user telling me that
his “screen was blank.” I told him to restart his system. To which he re-
sponded, “Shouldn’t I shut down the PC first?” I said: “I thought you just
told me the screen was blank!” He replied: “That’s right. There’s nothing on
the screen but my desktop.”
When Did It Happen?
Once you know the symptom, you need to try to inspect the problem your-
self. This doesn’t mean you need to go to the system, as many real problems
are easily fixed by the user, under your supervision. But you must under-
stand when the problem occurs so that you can zero in on where to look for
the solution. Does it happen at boot? It might be a CMOS/BIOS issue. Is it
taking place as the OS loads? Then you need to start checking initialization
files. Does it take place when the system runs untouched for a certain
amount of time? Then maybe the power management could come into play.
What Has Changed?
Systems that run properly tend to continue to run properly. Systems that
have undergone a hardware or software change have a much higher chance
of not running properly than a system that has not been changed. If some-
thing has gone wrong, talk to the user to determine whether anything par-
ticular has occurred since the system last worked properly. Has new

communication with users on
the IT Technician and Help Desk
Technician exams.

software been installed? Did the user add some new RAM? Change the
Windows Domain? Run a Windows Update? Drop the monitor on the floor?
Not only do you need to consider those types of changes, you must make
sure that any unrelated changes don’t send you down the wrong path. The
fact that someone installed a new floppy drive yesterday probably doesn’t
have anything to do with the printer that isn’t working today.
Last, consider side effects of changes that don’t seem to have anything to
do with the problem. For example, I once had a customer whose system kept
freezing up in Windows. I knew he had just added a second hard drive, but
the system booted up just fine and ran normally—except it would freeze up
after a few minutes. The hard drive wasn’t the problem. The problem was
that he unplugged the CPU fan in the process. When I discover a change has
been made, I like to visualize the process of the change to consider how that
change may have directly or indirectly contributed to a problem. In other
words, if you run into a situation where a person added a NIC to a function-
ing PC that now won’t boot, you need to think about what part of the instal-
lation process could be fouled up to cause a PC to stop working.
Check the Environment
I use the term environment in two totally different fashions in this book. The
first way is the most classic definition: the heat, humidity, dirt, and other
outside factors that can affect the operation of the user’s system. The other
definition is more technical and addresses the computing environment of
the system and other surrounding systems: What type of system do they
run? What OS? What is their network connection? What are the primary ap-
plications they use? What antivirus program do they run? Do other people
use the system?
Answering these questions gives you an overview of what is affecting
this system both internally and externally. A quick rundown of these issues
can reveal possible problems that might not be otherwise recognized. For
example, I once got a call from a user complaining they had no network con-
nection. I first checked the NIC to ensure it had link lights (always the first
thing to check to ensure a good physical connection!) only to discover that
they had no link lights⎯someone decided to turn on a space heater that
destroyed the cable!
Reproducing the Problem
My official rule on problems with a PC is this: “If a problem happens only
once, it is not a problem.” PCs are notorious for occasionally locking up,
popping errors, and displaying all types of little quirks that a quick reboot
fixes, and they don’t happen again. Why do these things happen? I don’t
know, although I’m sure if someone wanted me to guess I could come up
with a clever explanation. But the majority of PCs simply don’t have redun-
dancy built in, and it’s okay for them to occasionally “hiccup.”
A problem becomes interesting to me if it happens more than once. If it
happens twice, there’s a much higher chance it will happen a third time. I
want to see it happen that third time—under my supervision. I will direct
the user to try to reproduce the problem while I am watching to see what
Chapter 16: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Networks
371

triggers the failure. This is a huge clue to helping you localize the real prob-
lem. Intermittent failures are the single most frustrating events that take
place in a technician’s life. But do remember that many seemingly intermit-
tent problems really aren’t intermittent—you have simply failed to repro-
duce the events exactly enough to see the consistency of the problem.
Always take the time to match every step that leads to a problem to try to
re-create the same error.
Isolating the Symptom
With so many bits and pieces to a PC, you must take the time to try to isolate
the symptom to ensure your fix is going to the software or hardware that re-
ally needs it. In hardware, that usually means removing suspect parts until
only one possible part remains. In software, that usually means removing
background programs, booting into Safe mode, or trying to create a situa-
tion where only the suspected program is running.
Isolation takes on a whole new meaning with networks. One of the
greatest tools in networking is isolation—does this problem happen on
other systems, on other workgroups, on other PCs running DHCP? When-
ever a problem takes place in networking, isolation is the key to determining
the problem.
Separating Hardware from Software
Many problems that occur on a PC are difficult to isolate given that it is diffi-
cult to determine whether the problem lies in the software or the hardware.
If you find yourself in this situation, you can take a few steps to help you
zero in on which side of the PC to suspect.
Known Good Hardware
The absolute best way to know whether a problem is hardware or software
related is to replace the suspected piece of hardware with a known good
part. If you can’t tell whether a Windows page fault comes from bad RAM
or a software incompatibility, quickly replacing the RAM with known good
RAM should help you determine whether the RAM or the software is to
blame.
Uninstall/Reinstall
If you can do so easily, try uninstalling the suspected software and reinstall-
ing. Many hardware/software problems magically disappear with a simple
uninstall/reinstall.
Patching/Upgrading
Many hardware or software problems take place due to incompatibilities
between the two suspect sides. Try upgrading drivers. Download patches
or upgrades to software, especially if the hardware and the software are
more than two years apart in age.
372

Virus Check
Last (maybe I should have put this first), always check for viruses. Today’s
viruses manifest so many different symptoms that failure to check for them
is a study in time wasting. I recently got a new hard drive that started to
make a nasty clicking noise—a sure sign of a failing hard drive. However, I
ran an extensive virus check and guess what—it was a virus! Who would
have thought? I checked with the hard drive maker’s Web site, and my fears
were confirmed. It just goes to show you—even the best of techs can get
caught by the simplest problems.
Research
Once you’ve got your mind wrapped around the problem, it’s time to fix it.
Unless the problem is either simple (network cable unplugged) or some-
thing you’ve seen before and know exactly how to fix, you’ll almost cer-
tainly need to research it. The Internet makes this easy. I use one of my
favorite tricks when I get some bizarre error text: I type the error message
into my search engine—that would be Google, of course—and most times
find a quick fix!
Make the Fix and Test
Once you have a good idea as to the problem and how to fix it, it’s time to do
the fix. Always make backups—or at least warn the user of the risk to the
system. If possible, try to remember how the system was configured before
the fix so that you can go back to square one if the fix fails to work. After you
perform the fix, do whatever you need to do to make sure the system is
again working properly. Make sure the user sees that the system is working
properly so that he or she can “sign off” on your work.
OSI Seven-Layer Model
A lot of people think about networks and troubleshoot networking issues
using the OSI seven-layer model. Using this model (or my four-layer model,
described in the next section of this chapter) helps you isolate problems and
then implement solutions. Here are the seven layers of the OSI model:
■
Layer 1
Physical
■
Layer 2
Data Link
■
Layer 3
Network
■
Layer 4
Transport
■
Layer 5
Session
■
Layer 6
Presentation
■
Layer 7
Application
The Physical layer defines the physical form taken by data when it travels
across a cable. Devices that work at the Physical layer include NICs, hubs,
and switches. Figure 16.24 shows a sending NIC turning a string of ones and
Chapter 16: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Networks
373

zeroes into an electrical signal, and a receiving NIC
turning it back into the same ones and zeroes.
The Data Link layer defines the rules for access-
ing and using the Physical layer. MAC addresses
and Ethernet’s CSMA/CD operate at the Data Link
layer.
The Network layer defines the rules for adding
information to the data packet that controls how
routers move it from its source on one network to
its destination on a different network. The IP proto-
col that handles IP addressing works on Layer 3.
The Transport layer, Layer 4, breaks up data it
receives from the upper layers (that is, Layers 5–7)
into smaller pieces for transport within the data
packets created at the lower layers. In TCP/IP networks, the protocols that
typically handle this transition between upper and lower layers are TCP
and UDP.
The Session layer manages the connections between machines on the net-
work. Protocols such as NetBIOS and sockets enable a computer to connect
to a server, for example, and send and receive e-mail or download a file.
Each different task you can perform on a server would require a different
kind of session.
The Presentation layer presents data from the sending system in a form
that a receiving system can understand. Most Layer 6 functions are handled
by the same software that handles Layer 7 functions.
The Application layer is where you (or a user) get to interact with the com-
puters. These are programs that make networking happen, such as Web
browsers and e-mail applications. Chapter 17, “The Internet,” covers these
applications in a lot more detail.
The key to using the OSI seven-layer model is to ask the traditional trou-
bleshooting question: What can the problem be? If Jill can’t browse a Web
site, for example, could this be a Layer 7 issue? Sure: If her
browser software was messed up, this could stop her from
browsing. It could also be a lower level problem, though, and
you need to run through the questions. Can she do anything over
the network? If her NIC doesn’t show flashing link lights, that
could point all the way down to the Physical layer and a bad
NIC, cable, hub, or switch.
If she has good connectivity to the overall network but can’t
ping the Web server, that could point to a different problem
altogether. Figure 16.25 shows the OSI seven-layer model
graphically.
The only drawback to the OSI seven-layer model, in my
view, is that it’s too complex. I like to conceptualize network is-
sues into fewer layers—four to be precise. Let’s take a look.
Mike’s Four-Layer Model
Network problems, by the very nature of the complexity of a net-
work, usually make for more complex problems. Given that, I
have created a four-step process that I modestly call “Mike’s
374

The Physical layer turns binary code into a physical
signal and back into ones and zeroes.

Four-Layer Model.” These four things go through my mind every time I
have a problem. I think about four distinct “categories” to help me isolate
the symptoms and make the right fix.
Hardware
Hardware is probably the most self-explanatory of the four categories. This
covers the many different ways data can be moved from one PC to another.
Does the system have a good connection—how’s the cabling? This also cov-
ers network cards—are they installed properly and tested? Plus, the hard-
ware category hits on all of those interesting boxes, such as hubs, switches,
and repeaters, among which all of the wires in the network run. If you can
see it, it’s under this category.
Protocols
This category covers the protocols, such as TCP/IP or NetBEUI. Is the proto-
col installed? Is it configured properly? Does any particular system’s config-
uration prevent it from working with another system?
Network
The network category has two parts: servers and clients. Network operating
systems must differentiate systems that act as servers from those that do not.
If a system is a server, some process must take place to tell it to share re-
sources. Additionally, if a system is intended to share, it must be given a
name. This category also includes defining and verifying users and
groups—does your system need them? Do the right accounts exist, and are
they working properly?
Shared Resources
Once all the systems, users, and groups are working properly, you need to
identify the resources they will share. If a drive or folder is to be shared, the
OS must provide a way to identify that drive or folder as available for shar-
ing. The rules for naming shared resources are called naming conventions. A
great example would be a system that offers its D:\FRED directory for shar-
ing. This D:\FRED directory needs a network name, such as FRED_FILES.
This network name is displayed to all of the devices on the network.
Sharing a resource is only half the battle. Individual systems need to be
able to access the shared resources. The network needs a process whereby a
PC can look out on the network and see what is available. Having found
those available resources, the PC then needs to make them look and act as
though they were local resources. A network also needs to control access to
resources. A laser printer, for example, might be available for sharing, but
only for the accounting department, excluding other departments.

Chapter 16 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
maintaining and troubleshooting networks.
Installing and Configuring a Wireless Network
■
The types of wireless radio wave networks you’ll
find yourself supporting these days are those
based on the IEEE 802.11 wireless Ethernet
standard Wi-Fi and those based on the newer
Bluetooth technology. Wireless networks using
infrared light use the IrDA protocol.
■
Wireless networking capabilities of one form or
another are built into many modern computing
devices. Infrared transceiver ports have been
standard issue on portable computers, PDAs, and
high-end printers for years. Wireless Ethernet and
Bluetooth capabilities are increasingly popular as
integrated components, or they can easily be added
using USB, PCI, PCI Express, or PC Card adapters.
Many handheld computers and PDAs have
wireless capabilities built in or available as add-on
options.
■
To extend the capabilities of a wireless Ethernet
network, such as connecting to a wired network or
sharing a high-speed Internet connection, you need
a WAP. A WAP centrally connects wireless
network nodes in the same way that a hub
connects wired Ethernet PCs.
■
Wireless devices use the same networking
protocols and client that their wired counterparts
use, and they operate using the CSMA/CA
networking scheme, where nodes check before
broadcasting. Wireless nodes also use the RTS/
CTS protocol. When enabled, a transmitting node
that determines that the wireless medium is clear
to use sends an RTS frame to the receiving node.
The receiving node responds with a CTS frame,
telling the sending node that it’s okay to transmit.
Then, once the data is sent, the transmitting node
waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the
receiving node before sending the next data packet.
■
You will need a utility to set parameters such as
your SSID. Windows XP has built-in tools for this,
but otherwise you must rely on configuration tools
provided by the wireless network adapter vendor.
■
The simplest wireless network consists of two or
more PCs communicating directly with each other
without cabling or any other intermediary hardware
(ad-hoc mode). More complicated wireless networks
use a WAP to centralize wireless communication
and bridge wireless network segments to wired
network segments (infrastructure mode). Ad-hoc
networks are also good for temporary networks
such as study groups or business meetings.
Infrastructure mode is better suited to business
networks or networks that need to share dedicated
resources like Internet connections and centralized
databases.
■
Out of the box, wireless networks have no security
configured at all. WAPs are usually configured to
broadcast their presence to their maximum range
and welcome all other wireless devices that
respond. Data packets are floating through the air
instead of safely wrapped up inside network
cabling.
■
Most WAPs support MAC address filtering, a
method that enables you to limit access to your
wireless network based on the physical, hard-
wired address of the unit’s wireless network
adapter. Enabling WEP encrypts your data to
secure it while in transit over the airwaves, but
the WEP encryption standard itself is flawed and
cannot be relied upon to protect your data against
a knowledgeable and motivated attacker.
■
WPA and WPA2 address the weaknesses of WEP
and act as a sort of security protocol upgrade to
WEP-enabled devices. WPA and WPA2 offer
security enhancements such as an encryption key
integrity–checking feature and user authentication
through the industry-standard EAP.
■
Depending on the standard used, wireless
throughput speeds range from 2 Mbps to 54 Mbps.
Wireless devices dynamically negotiate the top
speed that they can communicate at without
dropping too many data packets.
376
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

■
Wireless networking speed and range are greatly
affected by outside factors, such as interference
from other wireless devices or solid objects.
A wireless device’s true effective range is probably
about half the theoretical maximum listed by the
manufacturer.
■
802.11a differs from the other 802.11-based
standards in significant ways. Foremost, it operates
in a different frequency range, 5 GHz, so 802.11a
devices are less prone to interference. 802.11a also
offers considerably greater throughput than 802.11
and 802.11b at speeds up to 54 Mbps, but its range
tops out at only about 150 feet. 802.11a isn’t widely
adopted in the PC world.
■
802.11b is practically ubiquitous in wireless
networking. The 802.11b standard supports data
throughput of up to 11 Mbps—on par with older
wired 10BaseT networks—and a range of up to
300 feet under ideal conditions.
■
The 802.11g standard offers data transfer speeds
equivalent to 802.11a, up to 54 Mbps, with the
wider 300-foot range of 802.11b. Because 802.11g is
backward compatible with 802.11b, the same
802.11g WAP can service both 802.11b and 802.11b
wireless nodes.
■
Wireless networking using infrared (IR)
technology is enabled via the Infrared Data
Association (IrDA) protocol stack, a widely
supported industry standard, and has been
included in all versions of Windows since
Windows 95. IR is designed to make only a
point-to-point connection between two devices in
ad-hoc mode of up to 4 Mbps, at a maximum
distance of 1 meter.
■
Bluetooth wireless technology is designed to create
small wireless Personal Area Networks (PANs)
that link PCs to peripheral devices such as PDAs
and printers, input devices such as keyboards and
mice, and even consumer electronics such as cell
phones, home stereos, televisions, home security
systems, and so on. Bluetooth is not designed to be
a full-function networking solution.
■
Cellular wireless networks enable you to connect
to the Internet through a network-aware PDA or
cell phone with download speeds up to 700 Kbps.
Cellular networks use various protocols, including
GSM, GPRS, and CDMA. While pricey, it is
sometimes your only option in remote areas.
■
The mechanics of setting up a wireless network
don’t differ much from a wired network.
Physically installing a wireless network adapter is
the same as installing a wired NIC, whether it’s an
internal PCI card, a PC Card, or an external USB
device. Simply install the device and let plug and
play handle detection and resource allocation.
Unless you’re using Windows XP, you also need to
install the wireless network configuration utility
supplied with your wireless network adapter so
that you can set your communication mode, SSID,
and so on.
■
Wi-Fi networks support ad-hoc and infrastructure
operation modes. Which mode you choose
depends on the number of wireless nodes you need
to support, the type of data sharing they’ll
perform, and your management requirements.
■
Ad-hoc wireless networks don’t need a WAP. The
only requirements in an ad-hoc mode wireless
network are that each wireless node be configured
with the same network name (SSID) and that no
two nodes use the same IP address. You may also
have to select a common channel for all ad-hoc
nodes.
■
Typically, infrastructure mode wireless networks
employ one or more WAPs connected to a wired
network segment, a corporate intranet or the
Internet, or both. As with ad-hoc mode wireless
networks, infrastructure mode networks require
that the same SSID be configured on all nodes and
WAPs.
■
WAPs have an integrated Web server and are
configured through a browser-based setup utility.
Typically, you enter the WAP’s default IP address
to bring up the configuration page and supply an
administrative password, included with your
WAP’s documentation, to log in.
■
Set up WEP encryption—if that’s your only
option—by turning encryption on at the WAP and
then generating a unique security key. Then
configure all connected wireless nodes on the
network with the same key information. WPA and
WPA2 encryption are configured in much the same
way. You may be required to input a valid user
name and password to configure encryption using
WPA/WPA2.
Chapter 16: Maintaining and Troubleshooting Networks
377

■
IrDA links are made between devices dynamically,
without user interaction. Typically, there’s nothing
to configure on an infrared-equipped PC. Just
check your network settings to ensure that you’ve
got the IrDA protocol installed and enabled.
■
File transfers via IrDA are simple. The sending
(primary) device negotiates a connection to the
receiving (secondary) device, and transfers the file.
To configure file transfer options and the default
location for received files, use the Windows
Wireless Link applet.
■
As with other wireless networking solutions,
Bluetooth devices are completely plug and play.
Just connect the adapter and follow the prompts to
install the appropriate drivers and configuration
utilities. Connecting to a Bluetooth PAN is handled
by specialized utility software provided by your
portable device or Bluetooth device vendor.
Troubleshooting Networks
■
The one thing that all PC problems have in
common is a symptom. If you’re working with a
user you must try to get the user to describe the
symptom. Then you must verify that the symptom
is legitimate. Try to inspect the problem yourself.
Find out when it occurs in order to zero in on
where to look for the solution.
■
Systems are much more likely to have problems
after a hardware or software change; check to see if
that has happened since the system last worked
properly. When you discover a change has been
made, try to visualize the process of the change to
consider how that change may have directly or
indirectly contributed to a problem.
■
Check the environment to get an overview of what
is affecting this system both internally and
externally. The larger environment—heat,
humidity, dirt, and other outside factors—may
affect the operation of the system, as may the
computing environment of this system and other
surrounding systems, including the type of system,
OS, network connection, primary applications,
antivirus program, and other users.
■
If a problem happens twice, there’s a much higher
chance it will happen a third time. Direct the user
to try to reproduce the problem while you watch to
see what triggers the failure. Many seemingly
intermittent problems really aren’t intermittent—
you just haven’t reproduced the events exactly.
■
Take the time to try to isolate the symptom to
ensure your fix is going to the software or
hardware that really needs it. Remove suspect
pieces of hardware until only one possible “bad
apple” remains. Remove background programs,
boot into Safe mode, or try to create a situation in
which only the suspected program is running.
Isolation is also one of the greatest tools in
networking.
■
If you aren’t sure whether a problem lies in the
software or in the hardware, you can take a few
steps to help you zero in on which side of the PC to
suspect. The best is to replace the suspected piece
of hardware with a known good part, and then try
uninstalling the suspected software and
reinstalling. Try upgrading drivers. Download
patches or upgrades to software, especially if the
hardware and the software are more than two
years apart in age, and always check for viruses.
■
Once you’ve discovered the problem, unless it is
either simple (network cable unplugged) or
something you’ve seen before and know exactly
how to fix, you’ll need to research it. The Internet
makes this easy. One of my favorite tricks is to type
the error into my search engine and most times I
can find a quick fix.
■
Make backups—or at least warn the user of the
risk—before you try a fix. If possible, try to
remember how the system was set up before the fix
so that you can go back to square one if the fix fails
to work. After you perform the fix, do whatever
you need to do to make sure the system is working
properly. Have the user experience the system
working properly so that he or she can “sign off”
on your work.

You can use the OSI seven-layer model to
troubleshoot network problems. The Physical layer
defines the physical form taken by data when it
travels across a cable. The Data Link layer defines
the rules for accessing and using the Physical layer.
The Network layer defines the rules for adding
information to the data packet that controls how
routers move it from its source on one network to
its destination on a different network.

This chapter covers the skills you need as a PC tech to help people connect
to the Internet. It starts with a brief section on how the Internet works along
with the concepts of connectivity, and then it goes into the specifics on
hardware, protocols, and software that you use to make the Internet work for
you (or for your client). Let’s get started!

■How the Internet Works
The Internet enables users to communicate with one another over vast dis-
tances, often in the blink of an eye. As a PC tech, you need to know how PCs
communicate with the larger world for two reasons. First, knowing the pro-
cess and pieces involved in the communication enables you to troubleshoot
effectively when that communication goes away. Second, you need to be
able to communicate knowledgeably with a network technician when he or
she comes in to solve a more complex issue.
Internet Tiers
You probably know that the Internet is millions and millions of computers
all joined together to form the largest network on earth, but not many folks
know much about how these computers are organized. In order to keep ev-
erything running smoothly, the Internet is broken down into groups called
tiers . The main tier, called Tier 1, consists of nine companies called Tier 1 pro-
viders. The Tier 1 providers own long-distance, high-speed fiber-optic net-
works called backbones. These backbones span the major cities of the earth
(not all Tier 1 backbones go to all cities) and interconnect at special locations
called network access points (NAPs). Anyone wishing to connect to any of the
Tier 1 providers must pay large sums of money. The Tier 1 providers do not
charge each other.
Tier 2 providers own smaller, regional networks and must pay the Tier 1
providers. Most of the famous companies that provide Internet access to the
general public are Tier 2 providers. Tier 3 providers are even more regional
and connect to Tier 2 providers.
The piece of equipment that makes this tiered Internet concept work is
called a backbone router. Backbone routers connect to more than one other
backbone router, creating a big, interwoven framework for communication.
Figure 17.1 illustrates the decentral-
ized and interwoven nature of the
Internet. The key reason for inter-
weaving
the
backbones
of
the
Internet was to provide alternative
pathways for data if one or more of
the routers went down. If Jane in
Houston sends a message to her
friend Polly in New York City, for ex-
ample, the shortest path between
Jane and Polly in this hypothetical
situation is this: Jane’s message origi-
nates at Rice University in Houston,
bounces to Emory University in At-
lanta, flits through Virginia Com-
monwealth University in Richmond,
and
then
zips
into
SUNY
in
Chapter 17: The Internet
383
• Figure 17.1
Internet Tier 1 connections

New York City (Figure 17.2). Polly
happily reads the message and life
is great. The Internet functions as
planned.
But what happens if the entire
southeastern United States experi-
ences a huge power outage and
Internet backbones in every state from
Virginia to Florida goes down? Jane’s
message would bounce back to Rice
and the Rice computers. Being smart
cookies, the routers would reroute the
message to nodes that still func-
tioned—say, Rice to University of Chi-
cago, then University of Toronto, and
then SUNY (Figure 17.3). It’s all in a
day’s work for the highly redundant
and adaptable Internet. At this point in
the game (early 2007), the Internet sim-
ply cannot go down fully—barring, of
course, a catastrophe of Biblical pro-
portions.
TCP/IP—The
Common Language
of the Internet
As you know from all the earlier
chapters
in
this
book,
hardware
alone doesn’t cut it in the world of
computing. You need software to
make the machines run and create an
interface for humans. The Internet is
no exception. TCP/IP provides the
basic software structure for commu-
nication on the Internet.
Because you spent a good deal of time in the Essentials course working
with TCP/IP, you should have an appreciation for its adaptability and, per-
haps more importantly, its extendibility. TCP/IP provides the addressing
scheme for computers that communicate on the Internet through IP ad-
dresses, such as 192.168.4.1 or 16.45.123.7. As a protocol, though, TCP/IP is
much more than just an addressing system. TCP/IP provides the frame-
work and common language for the Internet. And it offers a phenomenally
wide-open structure for creative purposes. Programmers can write applica-
tions built to take advantage of the TCP/IP structure and features, creating
what are called TCP/IP services. The cool thing about TCP/IP services is
that they’re limited only by the imagination of the programmers.
You’ll learn much more about TCP/IP services in the software and “Be-
yond A+” sections of this chapter, but I must mention one service that

you’ve most likely worked with yourself, whether you knew them by that
term or not. The most famous service is the Hypertext Transport Protocol
(HTTP) , the service that provides the structure for the World Wide Web
(“the Web” for short), the graphical face of the Internet. Using your Web
browser —a program specifically designed to retrieve, interpret, and dis-
play Web pages—an almost endless variety of information and entertain-
ment is just a click away. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve started to look
up something on the Web, and suddenly it’s two hours later and I still have-
n’t looked up what I started out wanting to know, but I don’t actually care,
because I’ve learned some amazing stuff! But then when I do go look it up,
in just minutes I can find out information it used to take days to uncover. The
Web can arguably claim the distinction of being both the biggest
time-waster and the biggest time-saver since the invention of the book!
At this point, you have an enormous, beautifully functioning network.
All the backbone routers connect together with fiber and thick copper ca-
bling backbones, and TCP/IP enables communication and services for
building applications for humans to interface across the distances. What’s
left? Oh, that’s right: how do you tap into this great network and partake of
its goodness?
Internet Service
Providers
Every Tier 1 and Tier 2 provider
leases connections to the Internet to
companies called
Internet service
providers (ISPs) . ISPs essentially sit
along the edges of the Tier 1 and
Tier 2 Internet and tap into the flow.
You can, in turn, lease some of the
connections from the ISP and thus
get on the Internet.
ISPs come in all sizes. America
Online (AOL) has a huge pipe into
the Internet, enabling its millions of
customers (in the U.S. alone) to con-
nect from their local machines and
surf the Web. Contrast AOL with
Unisono net, an ISP in San Miguel
de Allende, Mexico (Figure 17.4).
Billed as the “Best ISP in San
Miguel,” it services only a small
(but delightful) community and the
busy tourist crowd. Functionally,
though, Unisono net does the same
thing AOL does, just without all the
bells, whistles, and mountains of
free CD-ROMs!
Chapter 17: The Internet
385
Microsoft calls the connec-
tions ISPs make to the Internet
access points, which I think is a
very bad name. You’d think we’d
be able to come up with new
terms for things! Instead, some
folks in this industry continue
rebranding things with the same
phrases or catchwords, only
serving to confuse already be-
wildered consumers.

Connection Concepts
Connecting to an ISP requires two things to work perfectly: hardware for
connectivity, such as a modem and a working telephone line; and software,
such as protocols to govern the connections and the data flow (all config-
ured in Windows), and applications to take advantage of the various TCP/
IP services. Once you have a contract with an ISP to grant you access to the
Internet, the ISP gives you TCP/IP
configuration numbers and data so
you can set up your software to con-
nect directly to a router at the ISP
that becomes your gateway to the
Internet. The router to which you
connect at the ISP, by the way, is of-
ten referred to as the default gate-
way . Once you configure your
software correctly, you can connect
to the ISP and get to the greater
Internet. Figure 17.5 shows a stan-
dard PC-to-ISP-to-Internet connec-
tion. Note that various protocols
and other software manage the con-
nectivity between your PC and the
default gateway.
■Connecting to the Internet
PCs commonly connect to an ISP using one of seven technologies: dial-up,
both analog and ISDN; dedicated, such as DSL, cable, and LAN; wireless;
and satellite. Analog dial-up is the slowest of the bunch and requires a tele-
phone line and a special networking device called a modem. ISDN uses dig-
ital dial-up and has much greater speed. All the others use a regular
Ethernet NIC. Satellite is the odd man out here; it may use either a modem or
a NIC, depending on the particular configuration you have, although most
folks will use a modem. Let’s take a look at all these various connection
options.
Dial-up
A dial-up connection to the Internet requires two pieces to work: hardware to
dial the ISP, such as a modem or ISDN terminal adapter; and software to gov-
ern the connection, such as Microsoft’s Dial-Up Networking (DUN) . Let’s look
at the hardware first, and then we’ll explore software configuration.
Modems
At some point in the early days of computing, some bright guy or gal no-
ticed a colleague talking on a telephone, glanced down at a PC, and then put
386

• Figure 17.5
Simplified Internet connectivity

two and two together: why not use telephone lines for data
communication? The basic problem with this idea is that
traditional telephone lines use analog signals, while com-
puters use digital signals (Figure 17.6). Creating a dial-up
network required equipment that could turn digital data
into an analog signal to send it over the telephone line, and
then turn it back into digital data when it reached the other
end of the connection. A device called a modem solved this
dilemma.
Modems enable computers to talk to each other via stan-
dard commercial telephone lines by converting analog sig-
nals to digital signals, and vice versa. The term modem is
short for MOdulator/DEModulator, a description of trans-
forming the signals. Telephone wires transfer data via ana-
log signals that continuously change voltages on a wire.
Computers hate analog signals. Instead, they need digital
signals, voltages that are either on or off, meaning the wire
has voltage present or it does not. Computers, being binary
by nature, use only two states of voltage: zero volts and posi-
tive volts. Modems take analog sig-
nals from telephone lines and turn
them into digital signals that the PC
can understand (Figure 17.7). Mo-
dems also take digital signals from
the PC and convert them into analog
signals for the outgoing telephone
line.
A modem does what’s called se-
rial communication: It transmits data
as a series of individual ones and
zeroes. The CPU can’t process data
this way. It needs parallel commu-
nication, transmitting and receiv-
ing data in discrete 8-bit chunks
(Figure 17.8). The individual serial
bits of data are converted into 8-bit
parallel data that the PC can understand through the universal asynchron-
ous receiver/transmitter (UART) chip (Figure 17.9).
There are many types of UARTs, each with different functions. All serial
communication devices are really little more than UARTs. External modems

can convert analog signals to
digital ones and vice versa, but
they must rely on the serial ports
to which they’re connected for the
job of converting between serial
and parallel data (Figure 17.10).
Internal modems can handle both
jobs because they have their own
UART built in (Figure 17.11).
Table 17.1 shows the UART chips
that have been used in PCs.
Phone lines have a speed
based on a unit called a baud ,
which is one cycle per second.
The fastest rate that a phone line
can achieve is 2400 baud. Mo-
dems can pack multiple bits of
data into each baud; a 33.6
kilobits per second (Kbps) mo-
dem, for example, packs 14 bits into every baud: 2400 × 14 = 33.6 Kbps.
Thus, it is technically incorrect to say, “I have a 56 K baud modem.”

The UART chip converts serial data to parallel data that the CPU can read.
• Figure 17.10
An external modem uses the PC’s serial port.
• Figure 17.11
An internal modem has UART built in.

The correct statement is, “I have a 56 Kbps modem.” But don’t bother; peo-
ple have used the term “baud” instead of bits per second (bps) so often for
so long that the terms have become functionally synonymous.
Modern Modem Standards: V.90 vs. V.92
The fastest data transfer speed a
modem can handle is based on its implementation of one of the
international standards for modem technology: the V standards . Set by the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the current top standards
are V.90 and V.92. Both standards offer download speeds of just a hair
under 56 Kbps, but they differ in upload speeds: up to 33.6 Kbps for V.90,
and up to 48 Kbps for V.92 modems. To get anywhere near the top speeds of
a V.90 or V.92 modem requires a comparable modem installed on the other
line and connecting telephone lines in excellent condition. In practice, you’ll
rarely get faster throughput than about 48 Kbps for downloads and 28 Kbps
for uploads.

Chip
Description
8250
This is the original chip selected by IBM for use in the PC. It
had several bugs, but IBM worked around them with built-in
routines written in the PC and XT ROM BIOS.
8250A
This chip was developed to fix the bugs in the 8250, but the fix
meant it did not work properly with the PC and XT BIOS,
although it does work with the AT BIOS. This chip does not
work adequately at speeds at or above 9600 bits per
second (bps).
8250B
This chip was developed to fix the bugs in the previous chips,
but still came with the interrupt enable bug contained in the
8250 chip. This made it compatible with the PC/XT BIOS, and
possibly also with the AT BIOS. It retains the problems with
rates above 9600 bps.
16450
This chip was initially picked by IBM for its AT systems. It
should be seen as the bare minimum for its OS/2 systems;
otherwise, the serial ports will not function properly. This chip
has a higher throughput than the previous chips and has an
added scratch register to aid in speed. The only drawback is
that it cannot be used with the PC/XT BIOS due to the
interrupt bug being fixed.
16550
This chip was an improvement over the 16450, but it cannot be
used for First In First Out (FIFO) buffering modes. It did enable
programmers to use multiple DMA channels, however. This chip
is not recommended for standard high-speed communication
use and should be replaced by the 16550A, even though it has a
higher throughput.
16550A
This chip has 16 built-in FIFO registers for receiving and
transmitting. It will increase your throughput without loss of
characters at higher rates of speed, due to the added registers.
This is the only UART installed on today’s systems.

Flow Control (Handshaking)
Flow control, also known as handshaking , is
the process by which two serial devices verify a conversation. Imagine
people talking on a CB radio. When one finishes speaking, he will say
“over.” That way, the person listening can be sure that the sender is finished
speaking before she starts. Each side of the conversation is verified. During
a file transfer, two distinct conversations take place that require flow
control: local (between modem and COM port) and end-to-end (between
modems).
The modems themselves handle end-to-end flow control. PCs can do lo-
cal flow control between the modem and COM port in two ways: hardware
and software. Hardware flow control employs extra wires in the serial con-
nection between the modem and the COM port to let one device tell the
other that it is ready to send or receive data. These extra wires are called
ready to send (RTS) and clear to send (CTS), so hardware handshaking is often
called RTS/CTS. Software flow control uses a special character called XON
to signal that data flow is beginning, and another special character called
XOFF to signal that data transmission is finished; therefore, software hand-
shaking is often called XON/XOFF. Software handshaking is slower and
not as dependable as hardware handshaking, so you rarely see it.
Bells and Whistles
Although the core modem technology has changed little
in the past few years, modem manufacturers have continued to innovate on
many peripheral fronts—pardon the pun and the bad grammar. You can
walk into a computer store nowadays, for example, and buy a V.92 modem
that comes bundled with an excellent fax machine and a digital answering
machine. You can even buy modems that you can call remotely that will wake
up your PC (Figure 17.12). What will they think up next?
Modem Connections: PCI, PCI Express, and USB
Modems connect to the PC
in two basic ways: internally or externally. Almost all internal modems
connect to a PCI or PCI Express expansion bus slot inside the PC, although
cost-conscious manufacturers may use smaller modems that fit in special
expansion slots designed to support multiple communications features such
as modems, NICs, and sound cards (Figure 17.13). Older AMD mother-
boards used Audio/Modem Riser (AMR) or Advanced Communication
Riser (ACR) slots, while Intel motherboards used Communication and Net-
working Riser (CNR) slots. Finally, and least expensive of all, many current
390
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
You can test a modem by
plugging in a physical device,
called a loopback plug, and then
running diagnostics.
• Figure 17.12
Some of the many features touted by the manufacturer of
the SupraMax modem
AMR, ACR, and CNR slots
have gone away, although you’ll
still find them on older systems.
Current systems use built-in
components or PCIe ×1 slots for
modems, sound, and NICs.

motherboards dispense with expansion cards entirely and come with the
modem integrated into the motherboard.
External modems connect to the PC through an available serial port
(the old way) or USB port (Figure 17.14). Many PCs come with two 9-pin
serial ports, whereas most external modems designed to connect to a se-
rial port come with a 25-pin connector. That means you will probably
need a 9-to-25-pin converter, available at any computer store. Virtually
all computers today have two or more USB ports in addition to serial
ports.
If you have the option, choose a USB modem, especially one with a vol-
ume control knob. The very low speeds of data communication over a mo-
dem make the physical type of the connection unimportant. Even the
slowest interface—the aging serial interface—can more than adequately
handle 56 Kbps data transfers. USB offers simple plug and play and easy
portability between machines, plus such modems require no external elec-
trical source, getting all the power they need from the USB connection.
Dial-up Networking
The software side of dial-up networks requires configuration within
Windows to include information provided by your ISP. The ISP provides
a dial-up telephone number or
numbers, as well as your user
name and initial password. In ad-
dition, the ISP will tell you about
any special configuration options
you need to specify in the software
setup. The full configuration of
dial-up networking is beyond the
scope of this book, but you should
at least know where to go to follow
instructions from your ISP. Let’s
take a look at the Network and
Internet Connections applet
in
Windows XP.

PPP
Dial-up links to the Internet have their own
special hardware protocol called
Point-to-Point
Protocol (PPP) . PPP is a streaming protocol developed
especially for dial-up Internet access. To Windows, a
modem is nothing more than a special type of network
adapter. Modems will have their own configuration
entry in the Network Connections applet.
Most dial-up “I can’t connect to the Internet”–type
problems are user errors. Your first area of investiga-
tion is the modem itself. Use the modem’s properties
to make sure the volume is turned up. Have the user
listen to the connection. Does she hear a dial tone? If
she doesn’t, make sure the modem’s line is plugged
into a good phone jack. Does she hear the modem dial
and then hear someone saying, “Hello? Hello?” If so,
she probably dialed the wrong number! Wrong pass-
word error messages are fairly straightforward— re-
member that the password may be correct, but the
user name may be wrong. If she still fails to connect,
it’s time to call the network folks to see what is not
properly configured in the Dial-up Networking
settings.

ISDN
A standard telephone connection comprises many pieces. First, the phone
line runs from your phone out to a network interface box (the little box on
the side of your house), and into a central switch belonging to the telephone
company. (In some cases, intermediary steps are present.) Standard metro-
politan areas have a large number of central offices, each with a central
switch. Houston, Texas, for example, has nearly 100 offices in the general
metro area. These central switches connect to each other through high-
capacity trunk lines. Before 1970, the entire phone system was analog; over
time, however, phone companies began to upgrade their trunk lines to digi-
tal systems. Today, the entire telephone system, with the exception of the
line from your phone to the central office, is digital.
During this upgrade period, customers continued to demand higher
throughput from their phone lines. The old telephone line was not expected
to produce more than 28.8 Kbps. (56 K modems, which were a big surprise to
the phone companies, didn’t appear until 1995.) Needless to say, the phone
companies were very motivated to come up with a way to generate higher
capacities. Their answer was actually fairly straightforward: make the entire
phone system digital. By adding special equipment at the central office and
the user’s location, phone companies can now achieve a throughput of up to
64 K per line (see the paragraphs following) over the same copper wires al-
ready used by telephone lines. This process of sending telephone transmis-
sion across fully digital lines end-to-end is called integrated services digital
network (ISDN) service.
ISDN service consists of two types of channels: Bearer, or B, channels
and Delta, or D, channels. B channels carry data and voice information at
64 Kbps. D channels carry setup and configuration information and carry
data at 16 Kbps. Most providers of ISDN allow the user to choose either one
or two B channels. The more common setup is two B/one D, usually called a
basic rate interface (BRI) setup. A BRI setup uses only one physical line, but
each B channel sends 64 K, doubling the throughput total to 128 K. ISDN
also connects much faster than modems, eliminating that long, annoying,
mating call you get with phone modems. The monthly cost per B channel is
slightly more than a regular phone line, and usually a fairly steep initial fee
is levied for the installation and equipment. The big limitation is that you
usually need to be within about 18,000 feet of a central office to use ISDN.
The physical connections for ISDN bear some similarity to analog
modems. An ISDN wall socket usually looks something like a standard
RJ-45 network jack. The most common interface for your computer is a de-
vice called a terminal adapter (TA). TAs look much like regular modems,
and like modems, they come in external and internal variants. You can
even get TAs that are also hubs, enabling your system to support a direct
LAN connection.
DSL
Digital subscriber line (DSL) connections to ISPs use a standard telephone
line but special equipment on each end to create always-on Internet connec-
tions at blindingly fast speeds, especially when compared with analog
394
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)
Another type of ISDN, called
a primary rate interface (PRI), is
composed of twenty-three
64-Kbps B channels and one
64-Kbps D channel, giving it a
total throughput of 1.5 megabits
per second. PRI ISDN lines are
rarely used as dial-up connec-
tions—they are far more com-
mon on dedicated lines.
The two most common forms
of DSL you’ll find are asynchron-
ous (ADSL) and synchronous
(SDSL). ADSL lines differ be-
tween slow upload speed (such
as 128, 256, or 384 Kbps) and
faster download speed (usually
2 Mbps). SDSL has the same up-
load and download speeds, but
telecom companies charge a lot
more for the privilege. DSL en-
compasses many such varia-
tions, so you’ll often see it
referred to as xDSL.

dial-up connections. Service levels vary around the U.S.,
but the typical upload speed is approximately 384 Kbps,
while download speed comes in at a very sweet 2+ Mbps!
DSL requires little setup from a user standpoint. A tech
comes to the house to install a NIC in the Internet-bound PC
and drop off a DSL receiver, often called a DSL modem
(Figure 17.20). The receiver connects to the telephone line
and the PC (Figure 17.21). The tech (or the user, if knowl-
edgeable) then configures the TCP/IP protocol options for
the NIC to match the settings demanded by the DSL pro-
vider, and that’s about it! Within moments, you’re surfing
at blazing speeds. You don’t need a second telephone line.
You don’t need to wear a special propeller hat or anything.
The only kicker is that your house has to be within a fairly
short distance from a main phone service switching center,
something like 18,000 feet. This pretty much stops every-
body but inner-city dwellers from having access to DSL
service.
Cable
Cable offers a different approach to high-speed Internet access, using regular
cable TV cables to serve up lightning-fast speeds. It offers comparable service to
DSL with a 384 Kbps upload and 2+ Mbps download. Cable Internet connec-
tions are theoretically available anywhere you can get cable TV.
Cable Internet connections start with an RG-6 or RG-59 cable coming into
your house. The cable connects to a cable modem that then connects to a NIC
in your PC via UTP Ethernet cable. Figure 17.22
shows a typical cable setup. One nice advantage
of cable over DSL is that if you have a TV tuner
card in your PC, you can use the same cable con-
nection (with a splitter) to watch TV on your PC.
Both DSL and cable modem Internet connections
can be used by two or more computers if they are
part of a LAN, including those in a home.
LAN
Most businesses connect their internal local area
network (LAN) to an ISP via some hardware

solution that Network+ techs deal with. Figure 17.23 shows a typical
small-business wiring closet with routers that connect the LAN to the ISP.
To complete a LAN connection to the Internet, you need to add a second
NIC or a modem to one of the PCs and then configure that PC as the default
connection. We’ll revisit this idea in a moment with Internet Connection
Sharing.
Wireless
Every once in a while a technology comes along that, once the kinks are
smoothed out, works flawlessly, creating a magical computing experience.
Unfortunately, the various wireless networking technologies out there to-
day don’t fulfill that dream yet. When they work, it’s like magic. You walk
into a coffee shop, sit down, and flip open your laptop computer. After fir-
ing up your Internet browser, suddenly you’re quaffing lattes and surfing
Web sites—with no wires at all.
Connecting to the Internet via wireless means that you must connect to a
LAN that’s wired to an ISP or connect to a cellular network. The local
Internet café purchases high-speed Internet service from the cable or
telecom company, for example, and then connects a wireless access point
(WAP) to its network. When you walk in with your portable PC with wire-
less NIC and open a Web browser, the wireless NIC communicates with the
fully wired DHCP server via the WAP and you’re surfing on the Internet. It
appears magically wireless, but the LAN to ISP connection still uses wires.
Cellular networking is even more seamless. Anywhere you can connect
with your cell phone, you can connect with your cellular network–aware
portable or laptop computer.
Satellite
Satellite connections to the Internet get the data beamed to a satellite dish on
your house or office; a receiver handles the flow of data, eventually sending
it through an Ethernet cable to the NIC in your PC. I can already sense peo-
ple’s eyebrows raising. “Yeah, that’s the download connection. But what
about the upload connection?” Very astute, me hearties! The early days of
satellite required you to connect via a modem. You would upload at the
slow 26- to 48-Kbps modem speed, but then get super fast downloads from
the dish. It worked, so why complain? Newer technology still requires the
initial setup be done via modem, but the download and the upload go
through the dish. You really can move to that shack on the side of the Hima-
layas to write the great Tibetan novel, and still have DSL- or cable-speed
Internet connectivity. Sweet!
Satellite might be the most intriguing of all the technologies used to con-
nect to the Internet today. As with satellite television, though, you need to
have the satellite dish point at the satellites (toward the south if you live in
the U.S.). The only significant issue to satellite is that the distance the signal
must travel creates a small delay called the satellite latency. This latency is
usually unnoticeable unless the signal degrades in foul weather such as rain
and snow.

A wiring closet
One form of wireless commu-
nication does not require local
wires. Wireless Broadband relies
on the ISP putting up a tower,
and then any building within the
line of sight (perhaps up to
10 miles) can get a high-speed
connection.

Internet Connection Sharing
Windows 98 SE came out with a number of improvements over Windows 98,
and one of the most popular was the inclusion of Internet Connection Sharing
(ICS) . ICS enables one system to share its Internet connection with other
systems on the network, providing a quick and easy method for multiple
systems to use one Internet con-
nection. Windows 2000 and Win-
dows XP also provide this handy
tool. Figure 17.24 shows a typical
setup for ICS. Note the terminol-
ogy used here. The PC that con-
nects to the Internet and then
shares via ICS that connection with
machines on a LAN is called the
ICS host computer. PCs that con-
nect via LAN to the ICS host com-
puter
are
simply
called
client
computers.
To connect multiple comput-
ers to a single ICS host computer
requires several things in place.
First, the ICS host computer has to have a NIC dedicated to the internal con-
nections. If you connect via dial-up, for example, the ICS host computer uses
a modem to connect to the Internet. It will also have a NIC that plugs into a
hub. Other PCs on the LAN likewise connect to the hub. If you connect via
some faster service, such as DSL that uses a NIC cabled to the DSL receiver,
you’ll need a second NIC in the ICS host machine to connect to the LAN and
the client computers.
Setting up ICS in Windows 2000/XP is very simple. Open the properties
dialog for My Network Places, and then access the properties of the connec-
tion you wish to share. Click the Sharing tab (Windows 2000) or the Ad-
vanced tab (Windows XP) and select Enable internet connection sharing for
this connection (Windows 2000) or Allow other network users to connect
through this computer’s internet connection (Windows XP, Figure 17.25).
Clients don’t need any special configuration but should simply be set to
DHCP for their IP address and other configurations.
The Windows XP Internet
Connection Firewall
Once you’ve established a connection to the Internet, you should start thinking
about security. Windows 2000 requires you to use some third-party tool, such
as a hardware firewall, but Windows XP offers the Internet Connection Firewall
(ICF) built into the system. ICF basically stops all uninvited access from the
Internet. ICF keeps track of when you initiate communication with a particular
machine over your Internet connection and then allows communication back
from that same machine. This works whether your connection is a single ma-
chine directly dialed into an ISP or a group of networked PCs connecting
through an ICS host computer. ICF tracks the communication and blocks

Tech Tip
Hardware Solutions
for Connection Sharing
Several manufacturers offer ro-
bust, easy-to-configure hardware
solutions that enable multiple
computers to connect to a single
Internet connection. These boxes
require very little configuration
and provide a level of firewall
protection between the primary
computer and the Internet. You’ll
find these boxes more commonly
used with DSL and cable connec-
tions rather than any sort of
dial-up.
Linksys makes a great little
DSL/cable router, for example,
that offers four 10/100 Ethernet
ports for the LAN computers;
plus, you can configure it so that
to the outside world the router is
the PC. It therefore acts as a
firewall, protecting your internal
network from probing or mali-
cious users from the outside.

anything uninvited. You can implement ICF on the same screen as you
would ICS (Figure 17.26).
When you’re running a LAN, implement ICF only on the machine that
directly connects to the Internet. If you enable ICF on other machines on the
LAN, you can possibly create problems.
■Internet Software Tools
Once you’ve established a connection between the PC and the ISP, you can
do nothing on the Internet without applications designed to use one or more
TCP/IP services, such as Web browsing and e-mail. TCP/IP has the follow-
ing commonly used services:
■
World Wide Web
■
E-mail
■
Newsgroups
■
FTP
■
Telnet
■
VoIP

Implementing Internet Connection Firewall
ICF enables you to open up
specific computers inside a LAN
for specific tasks, such as run-
ning an FTP server.

Each of these services (sometimes referred to by the overused term
TCP/IP protocols) requires a special application, and each of those applica-
tions has special settings. You’ll look at all five services and learn how to
configure them.
The World Wide Web
The Web provides a graphical face for the Internet. Servers running special-
ized software called Web servers provide Web sites and Web pages that you
can access and thus get more or less useful information. Using Web-browser
software, such as Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, you can click a link on
a Web page and be instantly transported, not just to some Web server in
your home town, but anywhere in the world. Figure 17.27 shows Internet
Explorer at the home page of my company’s Web site, www.totalsem.com.
Where is the server located? Does it matter? It could be in a closet in my of-
fice or on a huge clustered server in Canada. The great part about the Web is
that you can get from here to there and access the information you need with
a click or two of the mouse.
Although the Web is the most popular part of the Internet, setting up a
Web browser takes almost no effort. As long as the Internet connection is
working, Web browsers work automatically. This is not to say you can’t
Chapter 17: The Internet
399
• Figure 17.27

make plenty of custom settings, but the default browser settings work al-
most every time. If you type in a Web address, such as the best search engine
on the planet—www.google.com—and it doesn’t work, check the line and
your network settings and you’ll figure out where the problem is.
Configuring the Browser
Web browsers are highly configurable. On most Web browsers, you can set
the default font size, whether it will display graphics, and several other set-
tings. Although all Web browsers support these settings, where you go to
make these changes varies dramatically. If you are using the popular
Internet Explorer that comes with Windows, configuration tools are found
in the Internet Options Control Panel applet or under the Tools menu.
Proxy Server
Many corporations use a proxy server to filter employee
Internet access, and when you’re on their corporate network you will have
to set your proxy settings within the Web browser (and any other Internet
software you want to use). A proxy server is software that enables multiple
connections to the Internet to go through one protected PC, much like how
ICS works on a home network. Unlike ICS, which operates transparently to
the client PCs by manipulating IP packets (we say that it operates at
Layer 3—the Network layer in the OSI model—see Chapter 16), proxy
servers communicate directly with the browser application (operating at
Layer 7, the Application layer). Applications that want to access Internet
resources send requests to the proxy server instead of trying to access the
Internet directly, both protecting the client PCs and enabling the network
administrator to monitor and restrict Internet access. Each application must
therefore be configured to use the proxy server. To configure proxy settings
in Internet Explorer, choose Tools| Internet Options. Select the Connections
tab. Then click the LAN Settings button to open the Local Area Network
(LAN) Settings dialog box (Figure 17.28).
Note that you have three options here, with automatic detection of the
proxy server being the default. You can specify an IP address for a proxy
server by clicking the third checkbox and simply typing it in (Figure 17.29).
Your network administrator or a CompTIA Network+ tech will give
you information on proxy servers if you need it to configure a machine.

Tech Tip
Ping
The command-line tool ping may
be your best friend for diagnosing
TCP/IP errors. Ping always
works; you don’t need to log on to
a server or even log on to a sys-
tem. Simply type in a DNS name
or an IP address. To run ping, get
to a command prompt (Start |
Run | type CMD | click OK)
and type ping followed by a DNS
name or IP address, like this:
c:\>ping www.whitehouse.gov
Then press the ENTER key. If the
Web server is up, you’ll get a
reply to that effect.
You can even ping yourself:
just type ping 127.0.0.1
(127.0.0.1 is known as the
loopback address). This can
give you a quick check to make
sure your NIC is functional. If
you ping an address and get the
famous “Request timed out” mes-
sage, the device you are trying to
ping is not available. Be aware,
however, that “Request timed
out” messages are fairly common
when you use ping on the
Internet because many servers
turn off the ping reply as a secu-
rity measure.
• Figure 17.28
The LAN Settings dialog box
• Figure 17.29
Specifying the proxy server address

Otherwise, you can safely leave the browser configured to search automati-
cally for a proxy server. If proxy servers are not used on your network, the
autoconfiguration will fail and your browser will try to connect to the
Internet directly, so there is no harm in just leaving Automatically detect
settings checked.
Security and Scripts
While we’re on the subject of configuration, make
sure you know how to adjust the security settings in your Web browser.
Many Web sites come with programs that download to your system and run
automatically. These programs are written in specialized languages and file
formats with names like Java and Active Server Pages. These programs
make modern Web sites very powerful and dynamic, but they can also act as
a portal to evil programs. To help with security, all better Web browsers let
you determine whether you want these potentially risky programs to run.
What you decide depends on personal factors. If your Web browser refuses
to run a Java program (you’ll know because you’ll get an warning message,
like in Figure 17.30), check your security settings, because your browser
may simply be following orders! To get to the security configuration screen
in Internet Explorer, choose Tools | Internet Options and open the Security
tab (Figure 17.31).
Chapter 17: The Internet
401
• Figure 17.30
Warning message about running ActiveX

Internet Explorer gives you the option of selecting preset secu-
rity levels by clicking the Custom level button on the Security tab
and then using the pull-down menu (Figure 17.32). Changing
from Medium to High security, for example, makes changes
across the board, disabling everything from ActiveX to Java. You
can also manually select which features to enable or disable in the
scrolling menu, also visible in Figure 17.32.
Security doesn’t stop with programs. Another big security
concern relates to Internet commerce. People don’t like to enter
credit card information, home phone numbers, or other personal
information for fear this information might be intercepted by
hackers. Fortunately, there are methods of encrypting this infor-
mation, the most common being HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer
(HTTPS) Web sites. It’s easy to tell if a Web site is using HTTPS be-
cause the Web address starts with HTTPS—instead of just HTTP,
as shown in Figure 17.33. The Web browser also displays a lock
symbol in the lower right-hand corner to remind you that you’re
using an encrypted connection.
There’s one security risk that no computer can completely de-
fend against: you. In particular, be very careful when down-
loading programs from the Internet. The Internet makes it easy to
download programs that you can then install and run on your sys-
tem. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with this unless the pro-
gram you download has a virus, is corrupted, contains a Trojan
horse, or is incompatible with your operating system. The watchword here
is common sense. Only download programs from reliable sources. Take time
to read the online documentation so you’re sure you’re downloading a ver-
sion of the program that works on your operating system. Finally, always
run a good antivirus program, preferably one that
checks incoming programs for viruses before you in-
stall them! Failure to do this can lead to lockups, file
corruption, and boot problems that you simply
should not have to deal with.
E-Mail
You can use an e-mail program to access e-mail. The
two most popular are Microsoft’s Outlook Express
and Mozilla’s Thunderbird. E-mail clients need a
little more setup. First, you must provide your
e-mail address and password. All e-mail addresses
come in the now-famous accountnameInternet do-
main format. Figure 17.34 shows e-mail information
entered into the Outlook Express Internet Connec-
tion Wizard.
The second thing you must add are the names of
the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) or Internet
Message Access Protocol (IMAP) server and the Sim-
ple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server. The POP3
or IMAP server is the computer that handles incom-
ing (to you) e-mail. POP3 is by far the most widely

Tech Tip
Web-Based Mail
Many people use Web-based
e-mail, such as Hotmail from
Microsoft or Gmail from Google,
to handle all of their e-mail needs.
Web-based mail offers the conve-
nience of having access to your
e-mail from any Internet-con-
nected computer. The benefit to
using a standalone program is
that most offer a lot more control
over what you can do with your
e-mail, such as flagging messages
for later review. Web-based mail
services, especially Gmail, are
catching up, though, and might
surpass traditional e-mail pro-
grams in features and popularity.

used standard, although the latest version of IMAP,
IMAP4, supports some features POP3 doesn’t. For
example, IMAP4 enables you to search through
messages on the mail server to find specific
keywords and select the messages you want to
download onto your machine. Even with the ad-
vantages of IMAP4 over POP3, the vast majority of
incoming mail servers use POP3.
The SMTP server handles your outgoing
e-mail. These two systems may often have the
same name, or close to the same name, as shown in
Figure 17.35. All these settings should be provided
to you by your ISP. If they are not, you should be
comfortable knowing what to ask for. If one of
these names is incorrect, you will either not get
your e-mail or not be able to send e-mail. If an
e-mail setup that has been working well for a while
suddenly gives you errors, it is likely that either
the POP3 or SMTP server is down, or that the DNS
server has quit working.
When I’m given the name of a POP3 or SMTP server, I use ping to deter-
mine the IP address for the device, as shown in Figure 17.36. I make a point
to write this down. If I ever have a problem getting mail, I’ll go into my
SMTP or POP3 settings and type in the IP address (Figure 17.37). If my mail
starts to work, I know the DNS server is not working.
Newsgroups
Newsgroups are one of the oldest services available on the Internet. To
access a newsgroup, you must use a newsreader program. A number of
third-party newsreaders exist, such as the popular Forté Free Agent, but
Microsoft Outlook Express is the most common of all newsreaders (not
surprising since it comes free with most versions of Windows). To access a
newsgroup, you must know the name of a news server. News servers run the

Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) . You can also use
public news servers, but these are extremely slow. Your
ISP will tell you the name of the news server and provide
you with a user name and password if necessary
(Figure 17.38).
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is also a great way to share
files between systems. FTP server software exists for most
operating systems, so FTP provides a great way to transfer
data between any two systems regardless of the operating
system. To access an FTP site, you must use an FTP client
such as WS_FTP, although later versions of Internet Ex-
plorer and other Web browsers provide support for FTP.
Just type in the name of the FTP site. Figure 17.39 shows
Internet Explorer accessing ftp.microsoft.com.
Even though you can use a Web browser, all FTP sites
require you to log on. Your Web browser will assume that
you want to log in as “anonymous.” If you want to log on
as a specific user, you have to add your user name to the
URL. (Instead of typing in ftp://ftp.example.com, you
would type in ftp://scottjftp.example.com.) An anonymous logon works
fine for most public FTP sites. Many techs prefer to use third-party pro-
grams such as WS_FTP (Figure 17.40) for FTP access because these third-
party applications can store user name and password settings. This enables
you to access the FTP site more easily later. Keep in mind that FTP was de-
veloped during a more trusting time, and that whatever user name and
password you send over the network is sent in clear text. Don’t use the same
password for an FTP site that you use for your domain logon at the office!

Telnet
Telnet is a terminal emulation program for TCP/IP networks that enables
you to connect to a server and run commands on that server as if you were
sitting in front of it. This way, you can remotely administer a server and
communicate with other servers on your network. As you can imagine, this
is rather risky. If you can remotely control a computer, what’s to stop others
from doing the same? Of course, Telnet does not allow just anyone to log on
and wreak havoc with your network. You must enter a special user name
and password to run Telnet. Unfortunately, Telnet shares FTP’s bad habit of
sending passwords and user names as clear text, so you should generally
use it only within your own LAN. If you need a remote terminal that works
securely across the Internet, investigate more sophisticated tools such as
SSH (Secure Shell).
Voice over IP
Voice over IP (VoIP) enables you to make voice calls over your computer
network. Why have two sets of wires, one for voice and one for data, going
to every desk? Why not just use the extra capacity on the data network for
your phone calls? That’s exactly what VoIP does for you. VoIP works with
every type of high-speed Internet connection, from DSL to cable to satellite.
VoIP doesn’t refer to a single protocol, but rather to a collection of proto-
cols that make phone calls over the data network possible. Venders such as
Skype and Vonage offer popular VoIP solutions, and many corporations
use VoIP for their internal phone networks.
Terminal Emulation
In Microsoft networking, we primarily share folders and printers. At times,
it would be convenient to be transported in front of another computer—to
feel as if your hands were actually on its keyboard. This is called terminal
emulation . Terminal emulation is old stuff—Telnet is one of the oldest TCP/
IP applications, but the introduction of graphical user interfaces cost it
much of its popularity. Today when techs talk about terminal emulation,
they are usually referring to graphical terminal emulation programs.
Like so many other types of Windows applications, graphical terminal
emulation originally came from third-party companies and was eventually
absorbed into the Windows operating system. While many third-party
emulators are available, one of the most popular is the University of
Cambridge’s VNC. VNC is free and totally cross-platform, enabling you to
run and control a Windows system remotely from your Macintosh system,
for example. Figure 17.41 shows VNC in action.
Windows 2000 Server (not Professional) was the first version of Win-
dows to include a built-in terminal emulator called Windows Terminal Ser-
vices. Terminal Services has a number of limitations: the server software
runs only on Windows Server and the client software runs only on Win-
dows—although the client works on every version of Windows and is free.
Figure 17.42 shows Windows Terminal Services running on a Windows
2000 computer.
Chapter 17: The Internet
407
All terminal emulation pro-
grams require separate server
and client programs.
The CompTIA A+ Certification
exams test your knowledge of a
few networking tools, such as
Telnet, but only enough to let
you support a Network+ tech or
network administrator. If you
need to run Telnet (or its more
secure cousin, SSH), you will get
the details from a network ad-
ministrator. Implementation of
Telnet falls well beyond
CompTIA A+.

Windows XP offers an alternative to VNC: Remote Desk-
top. Remote Desktop provides control over a remote server
with the fully graphical interface. Your desktop becomes the
server desktop (Figure 17.43). It’s quite incredible—although
it’s only for Windows XP.
Wouldn’t it be cool if, when called about a technical
support issue, you could simply see what the client sees? (I’m
not talking voyeur cam here.) When the client says that
something doesn’t work, it would be great if you could
transfer yourself from your desk to your client’s desk to see
precisely what is on the screen. This would dramatically cut
down on the miscommunication that can make a tech’s life so
tedious. Windows XP’s Remote Assistance does just that.
Based on the Shared Desktop feature that used to come with
the popular MSN Messenger program, Remote Assistance
enables you to give anyone control of your desktop. If a user
has a problem, he or she can request support directly from
you. Upon receiving the support request e-mail, you can then
log in to his or her system and, with permission, take the
driver’s seat. Figure 17.44 shows Remote Assistance in action.
Remote Assistance enables you to do anything you would
do from the actual computer. You can troubleshoot some
hardware configuration or driver problem. You can install
drivers, roll back drivers, download new ones, and so forth.
You’re in command of the remote machine as long as the client
allows you to be. The client sees everything you do, by the
way, and can stop you cold if you get out of line or do some-
thing that makes him or her nervous! Remote Assistance can
help you teach someone how to use a particular application.
You can log on to a user’s PC and fire up Outlook, for example,
and then walk through the steps to configure it while the user
watches. The user can then take over the machine and walk
through the steps while you watch, chatting with one another
the whole time. Sweet!
The new graphical terminal emulators provide everything
you need to access one system from another. They are com-
mon, especially now that Microsoft provides free terminal em-
ulators. Whatever type of emulator you use, remember that
you will always need both a server and a client program. The
server goes on the system to access and the client goes on the
system you use to access the server. On many solutions, the
server and the client software are integrated into a single
product.
Beyond A+
While the areas covered by the CompTIA A+ Certification exams do a great
job on the more common issues of dealing with the Internet, a few hot topics,
Chapter 17: The Internet
409
• Figure 17.43
Windows XP Remote Desktop Connection
dialog box
• Figure 17.44
Remote Assistance in action

although beyond the scope of the CompTIA A+ exams, are so common and
important that you need to know them: online gaming, chatting, and file
sharing.
Online Gaming
One of the more exciting—and certainly more
fun—aspects of the Internet is online gaming.
Competing online against a real person or people
makes for some amazing games—classics like
Hearts and Backgammon. Entire Web sites are
devoted to helping you find playing partners and
thereby enjoy thousands of different games
(Figure 17.45). Another popular genre of online
gaming is the “first-person shooters” format.
These games place you in a small world with up to
32 other players. A great example is Valve
Software’s Counter Strike: Source (Figure 17.46).
No discussion of online gaming is complete
without talking about the most amazing game
type of all—the massively multiplayer online
role-playing game (MMORPG). Imagine being an
elfin wizard, joined by a band of friends, all going
on adventures together in worlds so large that it
would take a real 24-hour day to journey across
them! Imagine that in this same world, 2000 to
3000 other players, as well as thousands of
game-controlled
characters,
are
participating!
Plenty of MMORPGs are out there, but the most
popular today is World of Warcraft (Figure 17.47).
Each of these games employs good old TCP/
IP to send information using special ports either
reserved by the game itself or by DirectX. For in-
stance, the Quake series of games uses port 26000,
while DirectX uses ports 47624 and 2300–2400.
Chatting
If there’s one thing we human beings love to do,
it’s chat. The Internet provides you with a multi-
tude of ways to do so, whether it be by typing or
actual talking. Keep in mind that chatting occurs
in real time. As fast as you can type or talk, the
other person or persons hear or see what you have
to say. In order to chat, however, you need some form of chat software. The
oldest family of chat programs is based on the Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
protocol, and the single most common IRC chat program is probably mIRC.
IRC protocols allow for a number of other little extras as well, such as the
ability to share files.

Today, companies such as AOL, Yahoo!,
and Microsoft have made their own chat pro-
grams that not only provide text chat but also
add features such as voice and video, turning
your PC into a virtual replacement for your
telephone! Figure 17.48 shows the popular
Microsoft Windows Live Messenger software.
File Sharing
The last extra Internet function to discuss is
also probably the most controversial: file
sharing. File sharing basically consists of a
whole bunch of computers with one program
loaded, such as Napster or Kazaa. The file-
sharing program enables each of the comput-
ers running that program to offer files to
share, such as MP3 music files and MPEG
movies. Once all the file-sharing computers
Chapter 17: The Internet
411
• Figure 17.47
World of Warcraft
• Figure 17.48
Windows Live Messenger in action

log on to the Internet, any of them can download any file offered by any
other in the group.
File sharing through such distributed sharing software becomes almost
anonymous and free—and that’s the problem. You can share anything, even
copyright-protected music, movies, and more. The music industry in partic-
ular has come out swinging to try to stop file-sharing practices. As a result,
the music industry is working on a way to shut down those persons who
share lots of files. But software developers have countered, creating Internet
protocols such as BitTorrent to handle the distribution and make the file
sharers much more difficult to find and punish. Figure 17.49 shows one of
the more popular BitTorrent protocol programs called µTorrent (the µ is the
symbol for “micro,” so you pronounce it “micro torrent”). BitTorrent has
many legitimate uses as well—its protocol is extremely efficient for the dis-
tribution of large files and has become the method of choice for distributing
Linux distributions and large open-source applications such as Apache and
OpenOffice.
These example programs just scratch the surface of the many applica-
tions that use the Internet. One of the more amazing aspects of TCP/IP is
that its basic design is around 30 years old. We use TCP/IP in ways com-
pletely outside the original concept of its designers, yet TCP/IP continues to
show its power and flexibility. Pretty amazing!

Chapter 17 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
the Internet:
How the Internet Works
■
A PC tech needs to know how PCs communicate
with the world for two reasons: (1) to troubleshoot
when a process or piece stops working and (2) to
communicate knowledgeably with a network
technician when he or she comes in to solve a more
complex issue.
■
The Internet is broken down into three tiers. Tier 1
providers own the fiber-optic backbones that
interconnect at network access points. Backbone
routers create an interwoven framework for
redundant communications.
■
TCP/IP provides the basic software structure for
Internet communications. It provides IP addresses
and the naming scheme for computers on the
Internet. This protocol suite also offers a variety of
other services, including HTTP that provides
structure for the Web.
■
Internet service providers (ISPs) lease connections
to the Internet from Tier 1 and Tier 2 providers. In
turn, ISPs lease connections to allow individuals
and companies to access the Internet. ISPs may
serve customers nationwide, such as America
Online (AOL), or they may be limited to a small
community of users.
■
Connecting to the Internet requires hardware for
connectivity and software to govern the connection
and data flow. The router that connects you to your
ISP is your default gateway.
Connecting to the Internet
■
Seven technologies are commonly used to connect
a PC to an ISP. These technologies fit into four
categories: (1) dial-up (analog and ISDN), (2)
dedicated (DSL, cable, and LAN), (3) wireless, and
(4) satellite. An analog dial-up, the slowest
connection, uses a telephone line and a modem.
ISDN is a much faster digital dial-up method. With
the exception of satellite that may use either a
modem or a NIC, all the other technologies use an
Ethernet NIC.
■
A dial-up connection needs hardware, such as a
modem or ISDN terminal adapter, and software
such as Microsoft’s DUN.
■
A modem converts digital signals from the PC into
analog signals that travel on telephone lines, and
vice versa. An example of serial communication, the
modem transmits data as a series of ones and
zeroes. On the other hand, the computer processes
data using parallel communication or data in
discrete 8-bit chunks. A UART chip converts serial
to parallel and parallel to serial. An external modem
uses the UART chip in the computer’s serial port,
while an internal modem has its own built-in UART.
■
Phone lines measure speed in bauds, or cycles per
second. However, the fastest baud rate a phone
line can achieve is 2400 baud. Today’s modems
pack multiple bits of data into each baud.
Although not technically correct, people use the
term baud instead of bps so often that the terms
have become synonymous.
■
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
sets V standards to define the fastest data transfer
speed a modem can handle. Currently V.90 and
V.92 are the highest standards, downloading data
just a little under 56 Kbps. Upload speeds differ,
with 33.6 Kbps being the fastest for V.90 and
48 Kbps proving the fastest for V.92 modems.
■
Modems may be internal or external. The
less-expensive internal modems usually connect to
a PCI or PCI Express expansion bus slot. Some
motherboards include special expansion slots used
for multiple communications features such as
modems, NICs, and sound cards. AMD calls such
slots ACRs; Intel named them CNR slots. Many
motherboards come with integrated modems.
External modems attach to the PC’s serial port or
USB port. Most motherboards today include two or
more USB ports. It is a good idea to choose a USB
modem so that you won’t need an external
electrical source, and it will likely include a volume
control knob.
Chapter 17: The Internet
413

■
Windows includes configuration options to set up
dial-up networks. Windows XP uses the Network
and Internet Connections applet, while Windows
2000 calls this feature Network and Dial-up
Connections. To configure dial-up networking,
you’ll need information from your ISP. Dial-up
links to the Internet use PPP streaming hardware
protocol.
■
If you can’t connect to the Internet, look at the
modem’s properties to make sure the volume is
turned up. Listen, too, for a befuddled voice on the
other end that would indicate your modem is
dialing the wrong number. Other things to check:
Be sure the line is plugged into a good phone jack,
and make sure the number and password are
correct. If you still can’t connect to the Internet, call
the network technicians to check that the dial-up
networking settings are correct.
■
An ISDN consists of two types of channels: Bearer,
or B, channels that carry data and voice at
64 Kbps, and Delta, or D, channels that transmit
setup and configuration information at 16 Kbps.
Users can use one or two B channels, but the most
common setup is the BRI consisting of two
B channels and one D to provide a throughput total
of 128 Kbps. Except for the steep cost of installation
and equipment, ISDN lines are only slightly more
expensive than regular phone lines, but this service
is limited to an area within about 18,000 feet of a
central office. ISDN uses a terminal adapter that
looks like a regular modem and may be either
external or internal.
■
DSL modems connect to an ISP using a standard
telephone line and special connections on each end.
Although service levels vary, typical upload speed
is ~384 Kbps with a download speed of ~2+ Mbps.
A tech usually comes to the house to install a DSL
receiver (often called a DSL modem) as well as a
NIC in the PC. DSL is usually limited to about
18,000 feet from a main phone service switching
center.
■
Cable TV companies offer high-speed Internet
access, with an upload speed of about 384+ Kbps
and download transmission rates of 2+ Mbps. With
a TV tuner card, cable enables you to watch TV on
your PC.
■
Many businesses connect their local area network
(LAN) to an ISP. This configuration requires either
a second NIC or a modem.
■
Wireless Internet service requires connecting to a
LAN that’s wired to an ISP. The other wireless
option is a satellite connection. Although early
satellite technology required uploads through a
slow modem (26–48 Kbps) and fast downloads
through the dish, newer technology uses the
modem only for the initial setup, sending both
downloads and uploads through the dish.
■
ICS enables multiple systems to use one Internet
connection. Included in Windows 2000/XP, ICS
uses an ICS host computer connected to the Internet
that then shares the connection via a LAN with
client computers. The ICS host computer must have
a NIC or modem to connect to the Internet and a
NIC that plugs into a hub. The other PCs then
connect to the hub.
■
If you have a connection to the Internet, you
should also have some kind of security. Windows
2000 requires you to use a third-party tool such as
a hardware firewall. Windows XP, however, has a
built-in firewall to stop uninvited access from the
Internet. ICF lets you communicate only with
machines that are responding to your initial
communication.
Internet Software Tools
■
Applications provide TCP/IP services, including
Web, e-mail, newsgroups, FTP, Telnet, and VoIP.
Using Web browser software, such as Internet
Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, you can access Web
sites and pages from Web servers throughout the
world. If you are unsuccessful in connecting to a
site, use the command-line tool ping to determine
whether the server is up. Simply type ping followed
by either the DNS name or the IP address. If the
device you are trying to ping is not available, you’ll
see a “Request timed out” message. You can use the
loopback address (127.0.0.1) to ping yourself.
■
A proxy server is software that enables multiple
connections to the Internet to go through one
protected PC. Configure proxy settings through the
Local Area Network Settings dialog box. Although
automatic detection of the proxy server is the
default setting, you can also specify an IP address
for a proxy server.
■
You should also know how to adjust security
settings in your Web browser. In IE, choose Tools |
Internet Options and open the Security tab. You
can set different security levels or manually select
the features you want to enable or disable.
414
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

■
Security also includes encrypting information such
as credit card numbers, home phone numbers, or
other personal information. The most common
method of encrypting this information is HTTPS.
You’ll identify Web sites using HTTPS by the
HTTPS: that appears at the beginning of the Web
address and the little lock icon.
■
You need an e-mail program such as Mozilla
Thunderbird to receive e-mail. To set up an e-mail
client, provide your e-mail address and password.
E-mail addresses use the accountname@Internet
domain format. You must also add the names of
the POP3 or IMAP server for incoming mail and
the SMTP server for outgoing mail.
■
You need a newsreader such as Outlook Express to
access a newsgroup. News servers run Network
News Transfer Protocol (NNTP). Check with your
ISP to get the name of the news server, along with
a user name and password if necessary.
■
FTP enables you to send and receive files. You may
use an FTP client such as WS_FTP, although later
versions of IE and other Web browsers provide
support for FTP. You’ll have to log on to an FTP
site, although most public FTP sites allow
anonymous logon.
■
Telnet is a terminal emulation program for TCP/IP
networks. It lets you connect to a server and run
commands as if you were sitting in front of the
server. Telnet requires a special user name and
password. The user name and password will be
sent over the network in clear text.
■
Voice over IP (VoIP) enables you to make voice
calls over your computer network and refers to a
collection of protocols. Vendors such as Skype and
Vonage offer VoIP solutions.
■
Today, terminal emulation usually means
graphical terminal emulation programs from
third-party companies or in the Windows
operating system. Terminal emulation programs
require separate server and client programs.
Windows 2000 Server was the first Windows
version to include a built-in terminal emulator
called Windows Terminal Services. The client
works on every version of Windows and is free.
Windows XP uses Remote desktop to provide full
functions of Terminal Services. In essence, your
desktop seamlessly becomes the server desktop.
■
Remote Assistance, available with Windows XP,
enables you to give anyone control of your
desktop. Useful for giving a tech control of a
computer to troubleshoot a hardware
configuration or driver problem, Remote
Assistance can also be used to install drivers or
teach someone how to use a particular application.

Remote Desktop is a great feature of Windows XP
Professional. However, making it work when the
computer you want to connect to is behind a router
or firewall can be difficult. There are many choices to
consider and configure, such as the computer’s
public IP address and port forwarding or network
address translation on the router. Using the Internet,
find a tutorial or a step-by-step “how-to” article that
guides you through configuring a remote computer
and router to make a Remote Desktop connection
possible.

Have you heard of WebDAV? Web Distributed
Authoring and Versioning is a set of extensions
added to Hypertext Transfer Protocol to support
collaborative authoring on the Web. While HTTP
is a reading protocol, WebDAV is a writing
protocol created by a working group of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF). WebDAV offers a
faster, more secure method of file transfer than FTP,
and some predict that it may make FTP obsolete. It’s
already incorporated into most current operating
systems and applications. Some authors say that
WebDAV will change the way we use the Web. Use
the Internet to learn more about WebDAV and its
features. Apple calls it “a whole new reason to love
the Net.” After learning about WebDAV, see if you

our PC is under siege. Through your PC, a malicious person can gain
valuable information about you and your habits. He can steal your files. He
can run programs that log your keystrokes and thus gain account names and
passwords, credit card information, and more. He can run software that takes
over much of your computer processing time and use it to send spam or steal
from others. The threat is real and right now. Worse, he’s doing one or more of
these things to your clients as I write these words. You need to secure your
computer and your users from these attacks.
But what does computer security mean? Is it an antivirus program? Is it big,
complex passwords? Sure, it’s both of these things, but what about the fact that
your laptop can be stolen easily? Before you run out in a panic to buy security
applications, let’s take a moment to understand the threat to your computers,
see what needs to be protected, and how to do so.

■Analyzing the Threat
Threats to your data and PC come from two directions: accidents and mali-
cious people. All sorts of things can go wrong with your computer, from a
user getting access to a folder he or she shouldn’t see to a virus striking and
deleting folders. Files can get deleted, renamed, or simply lost. Hard drives
can die, and optical discs get scratched and rendered unreadable. Accidents
happen, and even well-meaning people can make mistakes.
Unfortunately, there are a lot of people out there who intend to do you
harm. Add that intent together with a talent for computers, and you’ve got a
deadly combination. Let’s look at the following issues:
■
Unauthorized access
■
Data destruction, accidental or deliberate
■
Administrative access
■
Catastrophic hardware failures
■
Viruses/spyware
Unauthorized Access
Unauthorized access occurs when a user accesses resources in an unautho-
rized way. Resources in this case mean data, applications, and hardware.
A user can alter or delete data; access sensitive information, such as finan-
cial data, personnel files, or e-mail messages; or use a computer for pur-
poses the owner did not intend.
Not all unauthorized access is malicious⎯often this problem arises
when users who are randomly poking around in a computer discover that
they can access resources in a fashion the primary user did not intend. Un-
authorized access can sometimes be very malicious when outsiders know-
ingly and intentionally take advantage of weaknesses in your security to
gain information, use resources, or destroy data!
Data Destruction
Often an extension of unauthorized access, data destruction means more
than just intentionally or accidentally erasing or corrupting data. It’s easy to
imagine some evil hacker accessing your network and deleting all your im-
portant files, but consider the case where authorized users access certain
data, but what they do to that data goes beyond what they are authorized to
do. A good example is the person who legitimately accesses a Microsoft Ac-
cess product database to modify the product descriptions, only to discover
he or she can change the prices of the products, too.
This type of threat is particularly dangerous when users are not clearly in-
formed about the extent to which they are authorized to make changes. A fel-
low tech once told me about a user who managed to mangle an important
database due to someone giving them incorrect access. When confronted, the
user said: “If I wasn’t allowed to change it, the system wouldn’t let me do it!”

If you look at the CompTIA
A+ exam objectives for the
Essentials, IT Technician, and
specialization exams, you’ll
notice that the objectives
covered in this chapter are, for
all intents and purposes, virtu-
ally the same for each exam.
CompTIA has not differentiated
the questions for each exam
covered by this domain, so we
have used the same chapter for
the Essentials exam and the IT
Technician and specialization
exams.

Many users believe that systems are configured in a paternalistic way that
wouldn’t allow them to do anything inappropriate. As a result, users will often
assume they’re authorized to make any changes they believe are necessary
when working on a piece of data they know they’re authorized to access.
Administrative Access
Every operating system enables you to create user accounts and grant those
accounts a certain level of access to files and folders in that computer. As an
administrator, supervisor, or root user, you have full control over just about
every aspect of the computer. Windows XP, in particular, makes it entirely
too easy to give users administrative access to the computer, especially Win-
dows XP Home because it allows only two kinds of users, administrators
and limited users. Because you can’t do much as a limited user, most home
and small office systems simply use multiple administrator accounts. If you
need to control access, you really need to use Windows 2000 or XP
Professional.
System Crash/Hardware Failure
Like any technology, computers can and will fail—usually when you can
least afford for it to happen. Hard drives crash, the power fails—it’s all part
of the joy of working in the computing business. You need to create redun-
dancy in areas prone to failure (like installing backup power in case of elec-
trical failure) and perform those all-important data backups. The Essentials
course went into detail about using Microsoft Backup and other issues in-
volved in creating a stable and reliable system.
Virus/Spyware
Networks are without a doubt the fastest and most efficient vehicles for
transferring computer viruses among systems. News reports focus attention
on the many virus attacks from the Internet, but a huge number of viruses
still come from users who bring in programs on floppy disks, writable opti-
cal discs, and USB drives. This chapter describes the various methods of vi-
rus infection, and what you need to do to prevent virus infection of your
networked systems in the “Network Security” section.
IT Technician
■Local Control
To create a secure computing environment, you need to establish control
over local resources. You need to back up data and make sure that retired
hard drives and optical discs have no sensitive data on them. You should
recognize security issues and be able to respond properly. You need to
422
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

implement good access control policies, such as having all computers in
your care locked down with proper passwords or other devices that recog-
nize who should have access. Finally, you need to be able to implement
methods for tracking computer usage. If someone is doing something
wrong, you and the network or computer administrator should be able to
catch him or her!
To mimic the physician’s oath, here’s the technician’s oath: “Technician,
first, secure your data.” You need to back up data on machines in your care
properly. Also, techs need to follow correct practices when retiring or do-
nating old equipment. Let’s take a look.
What to Back Up
Systems in your care should have regular backups performed of essential
operating system files and, most importantly, data files. The Essentials
course covered the process of backing up data, such as running the Backup
or Restore Wizard in Windows 2000 and Windows XP, so the mechanics
aren’t covered here. Instead, this chapter looks more critically at what files
to back up and how to protect those files.
Essential Data
By default, the Backup or Restore Wizard in Windows XP offers to back up
your Documents and Settings folder (Figure 18.1). You also have options to
back up everyone’s documents and settings. That takes care of most, but not
all, of your critical data. There are other issues to consider.
First, if you use Microsoft Outlook for your e-mail, the saved e-mail mes-
sages—both received and sent—will not be backed up. Neither will your
address book. If you don’t care about such things, then that’s fine, but if you
share a computer with multiple users, you need to make certain that you or
the users back up both their mail and address book manually and then put
Chapter 18: Computer Security
423
Windows 2000 and 2003
open the Backup Wizard with
somewhat different settings.
You are prompted to back up the
entire drive initially, for example,
rather than just Documents and
Settings. This is also the case
when you run the wizard in Win-
dows XP in Advanced Mode.
• Figure 18.1
Backup or Restore Wizard

the backed-up files in the Documents and Settings
folder! That way, the Backup or Restore Wizard will
grab those files.
Second, if you or others on the computer use any
folders outside the Documents and Settings environ-
ment, then you need to select the Let me choose what to
back up option from the Backup or Restore Wizard
when prompted. This opens the Items to Back Up dia-
log where you can select individual files and folders to
back up (Figure 18.2).
Server Environments
If you work in an environment that requires you to
back up Windows 2000 Server or Windows Server
2003 computers, you need to back up some extra data.
This is especially true if you have a Windows network
running. Windows networking features Active Direc-
tory , a system that enables you to share files easily
within the network, yet still maintain rock-solid secu-
rity. A user only has to log in once to an Active
Directory server and then they have access to
resources throughout the Active Directory net-
work (assuming, of course, that the user has
permission to access those resources).
To back up the extra data, you need to run
the Backup Wizard and select the radio button
that says Only back up the System State data
(Figure 18.3). The System State data takes care
of most of the registry, security settings, the
desktop files and folders, and the default user.
If you want to back up more than that, close
the wizard and select the Backup tab in the
Backup dialog box. Check the box next to Sys-
tem State and then check off any other file or
folder that you want backed up (Figure 18.4).
From this same dialog box, you can select
where to back up the data, such as to a tape
drive or external hard drive.
Off-Site Storage
Backing up your data and other important in-
formation enables you to restore easily in case
of a system crash or malicious data destruction, but to ensure proper secu-
rity, you need to store your backups somewhere other than your office.
Off-site storage means that you take the tape or portable hard drive that con-
tains your backup and lock it in a briefcase. Take it home and put it in your
home safe, if you have one. This way, if the building burns down or some
major flood renders your office inaccessible, your company can be up and
running very quickly from a secondary location.

The CompTIA A+ certification
exams most likely won’t ask you
about off-site storage, but in
today’s world, anything less
would be illogical.

Migrating and Retiring
Seasons change and so does the state of the art in computing. At a certain point
in a computer’s life, you’ll need to retire an old system. This means you must
migrate the data and users to a new system or at least a new hard drive—a pro-
cess called migration —and then safely dispose of the old system. When talking
about migration or retirement in terms of security, you need to answer one
question: what do you do with the old system or drive?
All but the most vanilla new installations have sensitive data on them,
even if it’s simply e-mail messages or notes-to-self that would cause embar-
rassment if discovered. Most PCs, especially in a work environment, con-
tain a lot of sensitive data. You can’t just format C: and hand over the drive.
Follow three principles when migrating or retiring a computer. First, mi-
grate your users and data information in a secure environment. Until you get
passwords properly in place and test the security of the new system, you can’t
consider that system secure. Second, remove data remnants from hard drives
that you store or give to charity. Third, recycle the older equipment; don’t
throw it in the trash. PC recyclers go through a process of deconstructing

hardware, breaking system units, keyboards, printers, and even monitors into
their basic plastics, metals, and glass for reuse.
Migration Practices
Migrate your users and data information in a secure environment. Until you
get passwords properly in place and test the security of the new system, you
can’t consider that system secure. Don’t set a copy to run while you go out to
lunch, but rather be there to supervise and remove any remnant data that
might still reside on any mass storage devices, especially hard drives.
You might think that, as easy as it seems to be to lose data, that you could
readily get rid of data if you tried. That’s not the case, however, with mag-
netic media such as hard drives and flash memory. It’s very difficult to clean
a drive completely. Repeated formatting won’t do the trick. Partitioning and
formatting won’t work. Data doesn’t necessarily get written over in the
same place every time, which means that a solid wipe of a hard drive by
writing zeroes to all the clusters still potentially leaves a lot of sensitive and
recoverable data, typically called remnants , on the drive.
Although you can’t make data 100 percent unrecoverable short of physi-
cally shredding or pulverizing a drive, you can do well enough for donation
purposes by using one of the better drive-wiping utilities, such as Webroot’s
Window Washer (Figure 18.5). Window Washer gives you the ability to
erase your Web browsing history, your recent activity in Windows (such as
what programs you ran), and even your e-mail messages permanently. As
an added bonus, you can create a bootable disk that enables you to wipe a
drive completely.
Recycle
An important and relatively easy way to be an environmentally conscious
computer user is to recycle. Recycling products such as paper and printer
cartridges not only keeps them out of overcrowded landfills, but also en-
sures that the more toxic products are disposed of in
the right way. Safely disposing of hardware contain-
ing hazardous materials, such as computer moni-
tors, protects both people and the environment.
Anyone who’s ever tried to sell a computer more
than three or four years old learns a hard lesson—
they’re not worth much if anything at all. It’s a real
temptation to take that old computer and just toss it
in the garbage, but never do that!
First of all, many parts of your computer—such
as your computer monitor—contain hazardous ma-
terials that pollute the environment. Luckily, thou-
sands of companies now specialize in computer
recycling and will gladly accept your old computer.
If you have enough computers, they might even pick
them up. If you can’t find a recycler, call your local
municipality’s waste authority to see where to drop
off your system.

An even better alternative for your old computer is donation. Many
organizations actively look for old computers to refurbish and to donate
to schools and other organizations. Just keep in mind that the computer
can be too old—not even a school wants a computer more than five or
six years old.
Social Engineering
Although you’re more likely to lose data through accident, the acts of mali-
cious users get the vast majority of headlines. Most of these attacks come under
the heading of social engineering —the process of using or manipulating people
inside the networking environment to gain access to that network from the
outside. The term “social engineering” covers the many ways humans can use
other humans to gain unauthorized information. This unauthorized informa-
tion may be a network login, a credit card number, company customer
data⎯almost anything you might imagine that one person or organization
may not want a person outside of that organization to access.
Social engineering attacks aren’t hacking⎯at least in the classic sense of
the word⎯although the goals are the same. Social engineering is where
people attack an organization through the people in the organization or
physically access the organization to get the information they need. Here are
a few of the more classic types of social engineering attacks.
Infiltration
Hackers can physically enter your building under the guise of someone who
might have a legitimate reason for being there, such as cleaning personnel,
repair technicians, or messengers. They then snoop around desks, looking
for whatever they can find. They might talk with people inside the organiza-
tion, gathering names, office numbers, department names—little things in
and of themselves, but powerful tools when combined later with other
social engineering attacks.
Telephone Scams
Telephone scams are probably the most common social engineering attack.
In this case, the attacker makes a phone call to someone in the organization
to gain information. The attacker attempts to come across as someone inside
the organization and uses this to get the desired information. Probably the
most famous of these scams is the “I forgot my user name and password”
scam. In this gambit, the attacker first learns the account name of a legiti-
mate person in the organization, usually using the infiltration method. The
attacker then calls someone in the organization, usually the help desk, in an
attempt to gather information, in this case a password.
Hacker: “Hi, this is John Anderson in accounting. I forgot my
password. Can you reset it please?”
Help Desk : “Sure, what’s your user name?”
Hacker: “j_w_Anderson”
Help Desk: “OK, I reset it to e34rd3.”
Chapter 18: Computer Security
427
It’s common for social engi-
neering attacks to be used to-
gether, so if you discover one of
them being used against your
organization, it’s a good idea to
look for others.

Certainly telephone scams aren’t limited to attempts to get network ac-
cess. There are documented telephone scams against organizations aimed at
getting cash, blackmail material, or other valuables.
Dumpster Diving
Dumpster diving is the generic term for anytime a hacker goes through your
refuse, looking for information. The amount of sensitive information that
makes it into any organization’s trash bin boggles the mind! Years ago, I
worked with an IT security guru who gave me and a few other IT people a
tour of our office’s trash. In one 20-minute tour of the personal wastebaskets
of one office area, we had enough information to access the network easily,
as well as to embarrass seriously more than a few people. When it comes to
getting information, the trash is the place to look!
Physical Theft
I once had a fellow network geek challenge me to try to bring down his
newly installed network. He had just installed a powerful and expensive
firewall router and was convinced that I couldn’t get to a test server he
added to his network just for me to try to access. After a few attempts to hack
in over the Internet, I saw that I wasn’t going to get anywhere that way. So I
jumped in my car and drove to his office, having first outfitted myself in a
techy-looking jumpsuit and an ancient ID badge I just happened to have in
my sock drawer. I smiled sweetly at the receptionist and walked right by my
friend’s office (I noticed he was smugly monitoring incoming IP traffic us-
ing some neato packet-sniffing program) to his new server. I quickly pulled
the wires out of the back of his precious server, picked it up, and walked out
the door. The receptionist was too busy trying to figure out why her e-mail
wasn’t working to notice me as I whisked by her carrying the 65-pound
server box. I stopped in the hall and called him from my cell phone.
Me (cheerily): “Dude, I got all your data!”
Him (not cheerily): “You rebooted my server! How did you do it?”
Me (smiling): “I didn’t reboot it—go over and look at it!”
Him (really mad now): “YOU <EXPLETIVE> THIEF! YOU STOLE MY
SERVER!”
Me (cordially): “Why, yes. Yes, I did. Give me two days to hack your
password in the comfort of my home, and I’ll see everything! Bye!”
I immediately walked back in and handed him the test server. It was fun.
The moral here is simple⎯never forget that the best network software secu-
rity measures can be rendered useless if you fail to protect your systems
physically!
Access Control
Access is the key. If you can control access to the data, programs, and other
computing resources, you’ve secured your system. Access control is com-
posed of five interlinked areas that a good, security-minded tech should
think about: physical security, authentication, the file system, users and
428

Tech Tip
Spoofing
Some sophisticated hackers alter
the identifying labels or addresses
of their computers to appear as
if they're someone or something
else. This process is called
spoofing. An e-mail message
that appears to be from a friend
but is actually spam is an exam-
ple of simple spoofing.

groups, and security policies. Much of this you know from previous chap-
ters, but this section should help tie it all together as a security topic.
Secure Physical Area and Lock Down Your System
The first order of security is to block access to the physical hardware from
people who shouldn’t have access. This isn’t rocket science. Lock the door.
Don’t leave a PC unattended when logged in. In fact, don’t ever leave a sys-
tem logged in, even as a limited user. God help you if you walk away from a
server still logged in as an administrator. You’re tempting fate.
For that matter, when you see a user’s computer logged in and unat-
tended, do the user and your company a huge favor and lock the computer.
Just walk up and press CTRL-L on the keyboard to lock the system. It works in
Windows 2000 and all versions of Windows XP and Windows Vista.
Authentication
Security starts with properly implemented authentication , which means in
essence, how the computer determines who can or should access it. And,
once accessed, what that user can do. A computer can authenticate users
through software or hardware, or a combination of both.
Software Authentication: Proper Passwords
It’s still rather shocking to me
to power up a friend’s computer and go straight to his or her desktop; or
with my married-with-kids friends, to click one of the parent’s user account
icons and not get prompted for a password. This is just wrong! I’m always
tempted to assign passwords right then and there—and not tell them the
passwords, of course—so they’ll see the error of their ways when they try to
log in next. I don’t do it, but always try to explain gently the importance of
good passwords.
You know about passwords
from the Essentials course so I
won’t belabor the point here. Suffice
it to say that you need to make cer-
tain that all your users have proper
passwords. Don’t let them write
passwords down or tape them to the
underside of their mouse pads
either!
It’s not just access to Windows
that you need to think about. If
you have computers running in a
public location, there’s always the temptation for people to hack the system
and do mean things, like change CMOS settings to render the computer
inoperable to the casual user until a tech can undo the damage. All modern
CMOS setup utilities come with an access password protection scheme
(Figure 18.6).
Hardware Authentication
Smart cards and biometric devices enable modern
systems to authenticate users with more authority than mere passwords.
Smart cards
are credit card–sized cards with circuitry that can be used to
identify the bearer of the card. Smart cards are relatively common for tasks
such as authenticating users for mass transit systems, for example, but fairly

ling access to computers and

Cross Check
Proper Passwords
So, what goes into making a good password? Based on what you
learned in the Essentials course, see if you can answer these questions.
What sorts of characters should make up a password? Should you ask
for a user’s password when working on his or her PC? Why or why not?
If you’re in a secure environment and know you’ll have to reboot sev-
eral times, is it okay to ask for a password then? What should you do?

uncommon in computers. Figure 18.7 shows a
smart card and keyboard combination.
People can guess or discover passwords,
but it’s a lot harder to forge someone’s finger-
prints. The keyboard in Figure 18.8 authen-
ticates users on a local machine using finger-
prints. Other devices that will do the trick are
key fobs, retinal scanners, and PC cards for
laptop computers. Devices that require some
sort of physical, flesh-and-blood authentica-
tion are called biometric devices .
Clever manufacturers have developed key
fobs and smart cards that use radio frequency
identification (RFID) to transmit authentica-
tion information, so users don’t have to insert
something into a computer or card reader. The
Prevarius plusID combines, for example, a
biometric fingerprint fob with an RFID tag
that makes security as easy as opening a ga-
rage door remotely! Figure 18.9 shows a plusID device.
NTFS, not FAT32!
The file system on a hard drive matters a lot when it comes to security. On a
Windows machine with multiple users, you simply must use NTFS, or you
have no security at all. Not just primary drives, but any secondary drives in
computers in your care should be formatted as NTFS, with the exception of
removable drives, such as the one you use to back up your system.
When you run into a multiple-drive system that has a second or third drive
formatted as FAT32, you can use the
CONVERT
command-line utility to
go from FAT to NTFS. The syntax is pretty straightforward. To convert a D:
drive from FAT or FAT32 to NTFS, for example, you’d type the following:
CONVERT D: /FS:NTFS

Users and Groups
Windows uses user accounts and groups as the bedrock of access control. A
user account gets assigned to a group, such as Users, Power Users, or Ad-
ministrators, and by association gets certain permissions on the computer.
Using NTFS enables the highest level of control over data resources.
Assigning users to groups is a great first step in controlling a local ma-
chine, but this feature really shines once you go to a networked environ-
ment. Let’s go there now.
■Network Security
The vast majority of protective strategies related to internal threats are
based on policies rather than technology. Even the smallest network will
have a number of user accounts and groups scattered about with different
levels of rights/permissions. Every time you give a user access to a resource,
you create potential loopholes that can leave your network vulnerable to
unauthorized access, data destruction, and other administrative night-
mares. To protect your network from internal threats, you need to imple-
ment the correct controls over user accounts, permissions, and policies.
Networks are under threat from the outside as well, so this section looks
at issues involving Internet-borne attacks, firewalls, and
wireless networking. The section finishes with discussion
of the tools you need to track computer and network activ-
ity and, if necessary, lock down your systems.
User Account Control
Through Groups
Access to user accounts should be restricted to the as-
signed individuals, and those accounts should have per-
mission to access only the resources they need, no more.
Tight control of user accounts is critical to preventing un-
authorized access. Disabling unused accounts is an im-
portant part of this strategy, but good user account control
goes far deeper than that. One of your best tools for user
account control is groups. Instead of giving permissions/
rights to individual user accounts, give them to groups;
this makes keeping track of the permissions assigned to
individual user accounts much easier. Figure 18.10 shows
me giving permissions to a group for a folder in Windows
2000. Once a group is created and its permissions set,
you can then add user accounts to that group as needed.
Any user account that becomes a member of a group
Chapter 18: Computer Security
431
• Figure 18.10
Giving a group permissions for a folder in
Windows 2000

automatically gets the permissions assigned to that group. Figure 18.11
shows me adding a user to a newly created group in the same Windows
2000 system.
Groups are a great way to get increased complexity without increasing
the administrative burden on network administrators, because all network
operating systems combine permissions. When a user is a member of more
than one group, which permissions does he or she have with respect to any
particular resource? In all network operating systems, the permissions of
the groups are combined, and the result is what you call the effective permis-
sions the user has to access the resource. Let’s use an example from Win-
dows 2000. If Rita is a member of the Sales group, which has List Folder
Contents permission to a folder, and she is also a member of the Managers
group, which has Read and Execute permissions to the same folder, Rita
will have both List Folder Contents and Read and Execute permissions to
that folder.
Watch out for default user accounts and groups—they can become secret
backdoors to your network! All network operating systems have a default
Everyone group, and it can be used to sneak into shared resources easily.
This Everyone group, as its name implies, literally includes anyone who
connects to that resource. Windows 2000 gives full control to the Everyone
group by default, for example, so make sure you know to lock this down!
432

• Figure 18.11
Adding a user to a newly created group in Windows 2000

All of the default groups—Everyone, Guest, Users—define broad
groups of users. Never use them unless you intend to permit all those folks
to access a resource. If you use one of the default groups, remember to con-
figure them with the proper permissions to prevent users from doing things
you don’t want them to do with a shared resource!
All of these groups and organizational units only do one thing for you:
They let you keep track of your user accounts, so you know they are only
available for those who need them, and they only access the resources you
want them to use.
Security Policies
While permissions control how users access shared resources, there are
other functions you should control that are outside the scope of resources.
For example, do you want users to be able to access a command prompt on
their Windows system? Do you want users to be able to install software?
Would you like to control what systems or what time of day a user can log
in? All network operating systems provide you with some capability to con-
trol these and literally hundreds of other security parameters, under what
Windows calls policies. I like to think of policies as permissions for activities
as opposed to true permissions, which control access to resources.
A policy is usually applied to a user account, a computer, or a group.
Let’s use the example of a network composed of Windows XP Professional
systems with a Windows 2003 Server system. Every Windows XP system
has its own local policies program, which enables policies to be placed on
that system only. Figure 18.12 shows the tool you use to set local policies on
an individual system, called Local Security Settings , being used to deny the
user account Danar the capability to log on locally.
Local policies work great for individual systems, but they can be a pain
to configure if you want to apply the same settings to more than one PC on
your network. If you want to apply policy settings en masse, then you need to
step up to Windows Active Directory domain-based Group Policy . Using
Group Policy, you can exercise deity-like—Microsoft prefers to use the term
granular—control over your network clients.
Chapter 18: Computer Security
433
• Figure 18.12
Local Security Settings

Want to set default wallpaper for every PC in your domain? Group Pol-
icy can do that. Want to make certain tools inaccessible to everyone except
authorized users? Group Policy can do that, too. Want to control access to
the Internet, redirect home folders, run scripts, deploy software, or just re-
mind folks that unauthorized access to the network will get them nowhere
fast? Group Policy is the answer. Figure 18.13 shows Group Policy; I’m
about to change the default title on every instance of Internet Explorer on
every computer in my domain!
That’s just one simple example of the types of settings you can configure
using Group Policy. There are literally hundreds of “tweaks” you can apply
through Group Policy, from the great to the small, but don’t worry too much
about familiarizing yourself with each and every one. Group Policy settings
are a big topic in the Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator (MCSA)
and Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) certification tracks, but
for the purposes of the CompTIA A+ exams, you simply have to be comfort-
able with the concept behind Group Policy.
Although I could never list every possible policy you can enable on a
Windows system, here’s a list of some of those more commonly used:
■
Prevent Registry Edits
If you try to edit the Registry, you get a
failure message.
■
Prevent Access to the Command Prompt
This policy keeps
users from getting to the command prompt by turning off the
Run command and the MS-DOS Prompt shortcut.

Tech Tip
Linux and Policies
Linux doesn’t provide a single
application that you open to set
up policies, like Windows does. In
fact, Linux doesn’t even use the
name “policies.” Instead, Linux
relies on individual applications
to set up policies for whatever
they’re doing. This is in keeping
with the Linux paradigm of hav-
ing lots of little programs that do
one thing well, as opposed to the
Windows paradigm of having one
program try to be all things for
all applications.

■
Log on Locally
This policy defines who may log on to the system
locally.
■
Shut Down System
This policy defines who may shut down the
system.
■
Minimum Password Length
This policy forces a minimum
password length.
■
Account Lockout Threshold
This policy sets the maximum
number of logon attempts a person can make before they are locked
out of the account.
■
Disable Windows Installer
This policy prevents users from
installing software.
■
Printer Browsing
This policy enables users to browse for printers
on the network, as opposed to using only assigned printers.
While the CompTIA A+ exams don’t expect you to know how to imple-
ment policies on any type of network, you are expected to understand that
policies exist, especially on Windows networks, and that they can do amaz-
ing things in terms of controlling what users can do on their systems. If you
ever try to get to a command prompt on a Windows system, only to discover
the Run command is grayed out, blame it on a policy, not the computer!
Malicious Software
The beauty of the Internet is the ease of accessing resources just about any-
where on the globe, all from the comfort of your favorite chair. This connection,
however, runs both ways, and people from all over the world can potentially
access your computer from the comfort of their evil lairs. The Internet is awash
with malicious software—malware—that is even at this moment trying to infect
your systems. Malware consists of computer programs designed to break into
computers or cause havoc on computers. The most common types of malware
are viruses, worms, spyware, Trojan horses, adware, and grayware. You need
to understand the different types of malware so you can
combat them for you and your users successfully.
Viruses
Just as a biological virus gets passed from person to
person, a computer virus is a piece of malicious soft-
ware that gets passed from computer to computer
(Figure 18.14). A computer virus is designed to attach
itself to a program on your computer. It could be your
e-mail program, your word processor, or even a
game. Whenever you use the infected program, the
virus goes into action and does whatever it was de-
signed to do. It can wipe out your e-mail or even erase
your entire hard drive! Viruses are also sometimes
used to steal information or send spam e-mails to ev-
eryone in your address book.
Chapter 18: Computer Security
435
• Figure 18.14

Trojans
Trojans are true, freestanding programs that do something other than what
the person who runs the program thinks they will do. An example of a Tro-
jan virus is a program that a person thinks is a game but is actually a CMOS
eraser. Some Trojans are quite sophisticated. It might be a game that works
perfectly well, but when the user quits the game, it causes some type of
damage.
Worms
Similar to a Trojan, a worm is a complete program that travels from ma-
chine to machine, usually through computer networks. Most worms are de-
signed to take advantage of security problems in operating systems and
install themselves on vulnerable machines. They can copy themselves over
and over again on infected networks, and can create so much activity that
they overload the network, in worst cases even bringing chunks of the entire
Internet to a halt.
There are several things you can do to protect yourself and your data
against these threats. First, make sure you are running up-to-date virus
software—especially if you connect to the Internet via an always-on
broadband connection. You should also be protected by a firewall, either as
part of your network hardware or by means of a software program. (See the
sections on antivirus programs and firewalls later in this chapter.)
Since worms most commonly infect systems because of security flaws in
operating systems, the next defense against them is to make sure you have
the most current version possible of your operating system and to check reg-
ularly for security patches. A security patch is an addition to the operating
system to patch a hole in the operating system code. You can download se-
curity patches from the software vendor’s Web site (Figure 18.15).
Microsoft’s Windows Update tool is handy for Windows users as it pro-
vides a simple method to ensure that your version’s security is up to date.
The one downside is that not everyone remembers to run Windows Update.
Don’t wait until something goes wrong on your computer, or you hear on
the news that another nasty program is running rampant across the
Internet⎯Run Windows Update weekly (or even better automatically) as a
part of your normal system maintenance. Keeping your patches up to date
is called patch management, and it goes a long way toward keeping your
system safe!
Antivirus Programs
The only way to protect your PC permanently from getting a virus is to dis-
connect from the Internet and never permit any potentially infected soft-
ware to touch your precious computer. Because neither scenario is likely
these days, you need to use a specialized antivirus program to help stave off
the inevitable virus assaults.
An antivirus program protects your PC in two ways. It can be both
sword and shield, working in an active seek-and-destroy mode and in a pas-
sive sentry mode. When ordered to seek and destroy, the program will scan
the computer’s boot sector and files for viruses, and if it finds any, present
you with the available options for removing or disabling them. Antivirus
programs can also operate as
virus shields that passively monitor your
436
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

computer’s activity, checking for viruses only when certain events occur,
such as a program executing or a file being downloaded.
Antivirus programs use different techniques to combat different types
of viruses. They detect boot sector viruses simply by comparing the drive’s
boot sector to a standard boot sector. This works because most boot sectors
are basically the same. Some antivirus programs make a backup copy of the
boot sector. If they detect a virus, the programs will use that backup copy to
replace the infected boot sector. Executable viruses are a little more difficult
to find because they can be on any file in the drive. To detect executable vi-
ruses, the antivirus program uses a library of signatures. A signature is the
code pattern of a known virus. The antivirus program compares an execut-
able file to its library of signatures. There have been instances where a per-
fectly clean program coincidentally held a virus signature. Usually the
antivirus program’s creator will provide a patch to prevent further alarms.
Antivirus programs detect macro viruses through the presence of virus sig-
natures or certain macro commands that indicate a known macro virus.
Now that we understand the types of viruses and how antivirus programs
try to protect against them, let’s review a few terms that are often used
when describing certain traits of viruses.
Chapter 18: Computer Security
437
• Figure 18.15
Microsoft Update

Polymorphics/Polymorphs
A
polymorph virus
attempts to change its
signature to prevent detection by antivirus programs, usually by continually
scrambling a bit of useless code. Fortunately, the scrambling code itself can be
identified and used as the signature—once the antivirus makers become
aware of the virus. One technique used to combat unknown polymorphs is to
have the antivirus program create a checksum on every file in the drive. A
checksum in this context is a number generated by the software based on the
contents of the file rather than the name, date, or size of that file. The
algorithms for creating these checksums vary among different antivirus
programs (they are also usually kept secret to help prevent virus makers from
coming up with ways to beat them). Every time a program is run, the
antivirus program calculates a new checksum and compares it with the
earlier calculation. If the checksums are different, it is a sure sign of a virus.
Stealth
The term “stealth” is more of a concept than an actual virus
function. Most
stealth virus
programs are boot sector viruses that use
various methods to hide from antivirus software. The AntiEXE stealth
virus will hook on to a little-known but often-used software interrupt, for
example, running only when that interrupt runs. Others make copies of
innocent-looking files.
Virus Prevention Tips
The secret to preventing damage from a malicious
software attack is to keep from getting a virus in the first place. As discussed
earlier, all good antivirus programs include a virus shield that will scan
e-mail, downloads, running programs, and so on automatically (see
Figure 18.16).
Use your antivirus shield. It is also a good idea to scan PCs daily for pos-
sible virus attacks. All antivirus programs include terminate-and-stay resi-
dent programs (TSRs) that will run every time the PC is booted. Last but not
least, know the source of any software before you load it. While the chance
of commercial, shrink-wrapped software
having a virus is virtually nil (there have
been a couple of well-publicized exceptions),
that illegal copy of Unreal Tournament you
borrowed from a local hacker should defi-
nitely be inspected with care.
Keep your antivirus program updated.
New viruses appear daily, and your pro-
gram needs to know about them. The list of
viruses your antivirus program can recog-
nize is called the
definition file , and you
must keep that definition file up to date. For-
tunately, most antivirus programs will up-
date themselves automatically.
Get into the habit of keeping around an
antivirus CD-R—a bootable, CD-R disc with
a copy of an antivirus program. If you sus-
pect a virus, use the disc, even if your
antivirus program claims to have eliminated
the virus. Turn off the PC and reboot it from

the antivirus disc. (You might have to change CMOS settings to boot to opti-
cal media.) Run your antivirus program’s most comprehensive virus scan.
Then check all removable media that were exposed to the system, and any
other machine that might have received data from it or that is networked to
the cleaned machine. A virus or other malicious program can often lie dor-
mant for months before anyone knows of its presence.
E-mail is still a common source of viruses, and opening infected e-mails
is a common way to get infected. If you view an e-mail in a preview win-
dow, that opens the e-mail message and exposes your computer to some vi-
ruses. Download files only from sites you know to be safe, and of course the
less reputable corners of the Internet are the most likely places to pick up
computer infections.
Viruses are not, however, the only malicious software lurking in e-mail.
Sometimes the e-mail itself is the problem.
Spam
E-mail that comes into your Inbox from a source that’s not a friend, family
member, or colleague, and that you didn’t ask for, can create huge problems
for your computer and you. This unsolicited e-mail, called spam , accounts
for a huge percentage of traffic on the Internet. Spam comes in many flavors,
from legitimate businesses trying to sell you products to scammers who
just want to take your money. Hoaxes, pornography, and get-rich-quick
schemes pour into the Inboxes of most e-mail users. They waste your time
and can easily offend.
You can use several options to cope with the flood of spam. The first op-
tion is defense. Never post your e-mail address on the Internet. One study
tested this theory and found that over 97 percent of the spam received during
the study went to e-mail addresses they had posted on the public Internet.
Filters and filtering software can block spam at your mail server and at
your computer. AOL implemented blocking schemes in 2004, for example,
that dropped the average spam received by its subscribers by a large per-
centage, perhaps as much as 50 percent. You can set most e-mail programs
to block e-mail from specific people—good to use if someone is harassing
you—or to specific people. You can block by subject line or keywords. Most
people use a third-party anti-spam program instead of using the filters in
their e-mail program.

ten used piece of software. Over

can help, but you have to do some research to see which software offers
the best performance. You want to avoid software that causes false

miss legitimate e-mail messages from family and friends. So, time to fire
up your trusty Web browser and do some searching.

much more sophisticated, creating a number of intrusive and irritating
ways to get you to part with your money in one form or another.
There are basically three irritating Web browser problems: pop-ups,
spyware, and adware. Pop-ups are those surprise browser windows that
appear automatically when you visit a Web site, proving themselves irritat-
ing and unwanted and nothing else. Spyware , meanwhile, defines a family
of programs that run in the background on your PC, sending information
about your browsing habits to the company that installed it on your system.
Adware is not generally as malicious as spyware, but it works similarly to
display ads on your system. As such, these programs download new ads
and generate undesirable network traffic. Of the three, spyware is much less
noticeable but far more nefarious. At its worst, spyware can fire up pop-up
windows of competing products on the Web site you’re currently viewing.
For example, you might be perusing a bookseller’s Web site only to have a
pop-up from a competitor’s site appear.
Pop-Ups
Getting rid of pop-ups is actually rather tricky. You’ve probably
noticed that most of these pop-up browser windows don’t look like browser
windows at all. There’s no menu bar, button bar, or address window, yet
they are each separate browser windows. HTML coding permits Web site
and advertising designers to remove the usual navigation aids from a
browser window so all you’re left with is the content. In fact, as I’ll describe
in a minute, some pop-up browser windows are deliberately designed to
mimic similar pop-up alerts from the Windows OS. They might even have
buttons similar to Windows’ own exit buttons, but you might find that when
you click them, you wind up with more pop-up windows instead! What to
do?
The first thing you need to know when dealing with pop-ups is how to
close them without actually having to risk clicking them. As I said, most
pop-ups have removed all navigation aids, and many are also configured
to appear on your monitor screen in a position that places the browser win-
dow’s exit button—the little X button in the upper right-hand corner—
outside of your visible screen area. Some even pop up behind the active
browser window and wait there in the background. Most annoying! To rem-
edy this, use alternate means to close the pop-up browser window. For in-
stance, you can right-click the browser window’s taskbar icon to generate a
pop-up menu of your own. Select Close, and the window should go away.
You can also bring the browser window in question to the forefront by
pressing ALT-TAB until it becomes visible, and then press ALT-F4 to close it.
Most Web browsers have features to prevent pop-up ads in the first
place, but I’ve found that these types of applications are sometimes too thor-
ough. That is, they tend to prevent all new browser windows from opening,
even those you want to view. Still, they’re free to try, so have a look to see if
they suit your needs. Applications such as AdSubtract control a variety of
Internet annoyances, including pop-up windows, cookies, and Java applets,
and are more configurable—you can specify what you want to allow on
any particular domain address—but the fully functional versions usually
cost at least something, and that much control is too confusing for most
novice-level users.

Dealing with Spyware
Some types of spyware go considerably beyond this
level of intrusion. They can use your computer’s resources to run distributed
computing applications, capture your keystrokes to steal passwords,
reconfigure your dial-up settings to use a different phone number at a much
higher connection charge, or even use your Internet connection and e-mail
address list to propagate itself to other computers in a virus-like fashion!
Are you concerned yet?
Setting aside the legal and ethical issues, and there are many, you
should at least appreciate that spyware can seriously impact your PC’s per-
formance and cause problems with your Internet connection. The threat is
real, so what practical steps can you take to protect yourself? Let’s look at
how to prevent spyware installation, and how to detect and remove any
installed spyware.
Preventing Spyware Installation
How does this spyware get into your
system in the first place? Obviously, a sensible person doesn’t download
and install something that they know is going to compromise their
computer. Makers of spyware know this, so they bundle their software
with some other program or utility that purports to give you some benefit.
What kind of benefit? How about free access to MP3 music files? A pop-
ular program called Kazaa does that. How about a handy e-wallet utility that
remembers your many screen names, passwords, and even your credit card
numbers to make online purchases easier and faster? A program called
Gator does that, and many other functions as well. How about browser en-
hancements, performance boosters, custom cursor effects, search utilities,
buddy lists, file savers, or media players? The list goes on and on, yet they
all share one thing—they’re simply window-dressing for the real purpose of
the software. So you see, for the most part spyware doesn’t need to force its
way into your PC. Instead they saunter calmly through the front door. If the
graphic in Figure 18.17 looks familiar, you might have installed some of this
software yourself.
Some spyware makers use more aggressive means to get you to install
their software. Instead of offering you some sort of attractive utility, they in-
stead use fear tactics and deception to try to trick you
into installing their software. One popular method is
to use pop-up browser windows crudely disguised
as Windows’ own system warnings (Figure 18.18).
When clicked, these may trigger a flood of other
browser windows, or may even start a file download.
The lesson here is simple—don’t install these pro-
grams! Careful reading of the software’s license
agreement before you install a program is a good
idea, but realistically, it does little to protect your PC.
With that in mind, here are a couple of preventive
measures you can take to keep parasitic software off
of your system.
If you visit a Web site and are prompted to install
a third-party application or plug-in that you’ve
never heard of, don’t install it. Well-known and repu-
table plug-ins, such as Adobe’s Shockwave or Flash,
are safe, but be suspicious of any others. Don’t click

anywhere inside of a pop-up browser window, even if it looks just like a Win-
dows alert window or DOS command-line prompt—as I just mentioned, it’s
probably fake and the Close button is likely a hyperlink. Instead, use other
means to close the window, such as pressing ALT-F4 or right-clicking the
browser window’s icon on the taskbar and selecting Close.
You can also install spyware detection and removal software on your
system and run it regularly. Let’s look at how to do that.
Removing Spyware
Some spyware makers are reputable enough to
include a routine for uninstalling their software. Gator, for instance, makes
it fairly easy to get rid of their programs—just use the Windows Add/
Remove Programs applet in the Control Panel. Others, however, aren’t
quite so cooperative. In fact, because spyware is so—well, sneaky—it’s
entirely possible that your system already has some installed that you don’t
even know about. How do you find out?
Windows comes with Windows Defender, a fine tool for catching most
spyware but it’s not perfect. The better solution is to back up Windows De-
fender with a second spyware removal program. There are several on the mar-
ket, but two that I highly recommend are Lavasoft’s Ad-Aware (Figure 18.19)
and PepiMK’s Spybot Search & Destroy.
Both of these applications work exactly as advertised. They detect and
delete spyware of all sorts—hidden files and folders, cookies, registry keys
and values, you name it. Ad-Aware is free for personal use, while Spybot

Search & Destroy is shareware
(Figure 18.20). Many times I’ve
used both programs at the same
time because one tends to catch
what the other misses.
Grayware
Some programs, called grayware , are not destructive in and of themselves,
but they leach bandwidth in networks and can turn a speedy machine into a
doddering shell of a modern computer.
These programs are called grayware
because some people consider them
beneficial. They might even be benefi-
cial in the right setting. The primary ex-
ample
of
grayware
is
the
highly
popular peer-to-peer file-sharing pro-
grams, such as Bittorrent. Peer-to-peer
file-sharing programs enable a lot of
users to upload portions of files on de-
mand so that other users can download
them. By splitting the load to many
computers, the overall demand on a
single computer is light.
The problem is that if you have a
tight network with lots of traffic and
suddenly you have a bunch of that
bandwidth hogged by uploading and
downloading files, then your network
performance can degrade badly over-
all. So, is the grayware bad? Only in

ucation. It’s your job as the IT person to talk to users, especially the ones
whose systems you’ve just spent the last hour cleaning of nasties, about how
to avoid these programs. Show them samples of dangerous
e-mails they should not open, Web sites to avoid, and the types of
programs they should not install and use on the network. Any
user who understands the risks of questionable actions on their
computers will usually do the right thing and stay away from
malware.
Firewalls
Firewalls are an essential tool in the fight against malicious pro-
grams on the Internet. Firewalls are devices or software that pro-
tect an internal network from unauthorized access to and from the
Internet at large. Hardware firewalls protect networks using a
number of methods, such as hiding IP addresses and blocking
TCP/IP ports. Most SOHO networks use a hardware firewall,
such as the Linksys router in Figure 18.21. These devices do a
great job.
Windows XP comes with an excellent software firewall, called
the Windows Firewall (Figure 18.22). It can also handle the heavy
lifting of port blocking, security logging, and more.
You can access the Windows Firewall by opening the Win-
dows Firewall applet in the Control Panel. If you’re running the
Control Panel in Category view, click the Security Center icon
(Figure 18.23),and then click the Windows Firewall option in the
Windows Security Center dialog box. Figure 18.24 illustrates the
Exceptions tab on the Windows Firewall, showing the applica-
tions allowed to use the TCP/IP ports on my computer.
Encryption
Firewalls do a great job controlling traffic coming into or out of a
network from the Internet, but they do nothing to stop interceptor
hackers who monitor traffic on the public Internet looking for vul-
nerabilities. Once a packet is on the Internet itself, anyone with the
right equipment can intercept and inspect it. Inspected packets are
a cornucopia of passwords, account names, and other tidbits that
hackers can use to intrude into your network. Because we can’t
stop hackers from inspecting these packets, we must turn to en-
cryption to make them unreadable.
Network encryption occurs at many different levels and is in
no way limited to Internet-based activities. Not only are there
many levels of network encryption, but each encryption level pro-
vides multiple standards and options, making encryption one of

the most complicated of all networking issues. You need to understand
where encryption comes into play, what options are available,
and what you can use to protect your network.
Network Authentication
Have you ever considered the process that takes place each
time a person types in a user name and password to access a
network, rather than just a local machine? What happens
when this network authentication is requested? If you’re think-
ing that when a user types in a user name and password, that
information is sent to a server of some sort to be authenticated,
you’re right—but do you know how the user name and pass-
word get to the serving system? That’s where encryption be-
comes important in authentication.
In a local network, encryption is usually handled by the
NOS. Because NOS makers usually control software develop-
ment of both the client and the server, they can create their
own proprietary encryptions. However, in today’s increas-
ingly interconnected and diverse networking environment,
there is a motivation to enable different network operating
systems to authenticate any client system from any other
NOS. Modern network operating systems such as Windows
NT/2000/XP/2003 and NetWare 4.x/5.x/6.x use standard
authentication encryptions like MIT’s
Kerberos , enabling
multiple brands of servers to authenticate multiple brands

need to run Half-Life 2?)

of clients. These LAN encryptions are usually transparent and work quite
nicely even in mixed networks.
Unfortunately, this uniformity falls away as you begin to add remote ac-
cess authentications. There are so many different remote access tools, based
on UNIX/Linux, Novell NetWare, and Windows serving programs, that
most remote access systems have to support a variety of different
authentication methods.
PAP
Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is the oldest and most basic
form of authentication. It’s also the least safe, because it sends all passwords
in clear text. No NOS uses PAP for a client system’s login, but almost all
network operating systems that provide remote access service will support
PAP for backward compatibility with a host of older programs (like Telnet)
that only use PAP.
CHAP
Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is the most
common remote access protocol. CHAP has the serving system challenge
the remote client. A challenge is where the host system asks the remote client
some secret—usually a password—that the remote client must then
respond with for the host to allow the connection.
MS-CHAP
MS-CHAP is Microsoft’s variation of the CHAP protocol. It
uses a slightly more advanced encryption protocol.
Configuring Dial-up Encryption
It’s the server not the client that controls the choice of dial-up encryption.
Microsoft clients can handle a broad selection of authentication encryption
methods, including no authentication at all. On the rare occasion when you
have to change your client’s default encryption settings for a dial-up con-
nection, you’ll need to journey deep into the bowels of its properties.
Figure 18.25 shows the Windows 2000 dialog box, called Advanced Se-
curity Settings, where you configure encryption. The person who con-
trols the server’s configuration will tell you which encryption method
to select here.
Data Encryption
Encryption methods don’t stop at the authentication level. There are a
number of ways to encrypt network data as well. The choice of encryp-
tion method is dictated to a large degree by the method used by the
communicating systems to connect. Many networks consist of multiple
networks linked together by some sort of private connection, usually
some kind of telephone line like ISDN or T1. Microsoft’s encryption
method of choice for this type of network is called IPSec (derived from
IP security). IPSec provides transparent encryption between the server
and the client. IPSec will also work in VPNs, but other encryption meth-
ods are more commonly used in those situations.
Application Encryption
When it comes to encryption, even TCP/IP applications can get into the
swing of things. The most famous of all application encryptions is
Netscape’s Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security protocol, which is used
446

• Figure 18.25

to create secure Web sites. Microsoft incorporates SSL into its more
far-reaching HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) protocol. These protocols make it
possible to create the secure Web sites used to make purchases over the
Internet. HTTPS Web sites can be identified by the HTTPS:// included in
their URL (see Figure 18.26).
To make a secure connection, your Web browser and the Web server
must encrypt their data. That means there must be a way for both the Web
server and your browser to encrypt and decrypt each other’s data. This is
done by the server sending a public key to your Web browser so the browser
knows how to decrypt the incoming data. These public keys are sent in the
form of a digital certificate . This certificate not only provides the public key
but also is signed by a trusted authority that guarantees the public key you
are about to get is actually from the Web server and not from some evil per-
son trying to pretend to be the Web server. There are a number of companies
that issue digital certificates to Web sites; probably the most famous is
VeriSign, Inc.
Your Web browser has a built-in list of trusted authorities. If a certifi-
cate comes in from a Web site that uses one of these highly respected com-
panies, you won’t see anything happen in your browser; you’ll just go to
the secure Web page and a small lock will appear in the corner of your
browser. Figure 18.27 shows the list of trusted authorities built into the
Firefox Web browser.
Chapter 18: Computer Security
447
• Figure 18.26
A secure Web site

However, if you receive a certificate from someone not listed in your
browser, the browser will warn you and ask if you wish to accept the certifi-
cate, as shown in Figure 18.28.
What you do here is up to you. Do you wish to trust this certificate? In
most cases, you simply say yes, and this certificate is added to your SSL
cache of certificates. However, there are occasions where an accepted certifi-
cate becomes invalid, usually due to something boring, for instance, it goes

Securing Wireless Networks
Wireless networks are all the rage right now, from your local Starbucks
to the neighbors around you. Securing wireless networks has, therefore,
become an area that CompTIA A+ certified technicians must master.
You read a lot about wireless networks in Chapter 16, “Maintaining and
Troubleshooting Networks,” so turn there now and see if you can an-
swer these questions.
What is the minimum level of encryption to secure a wireless net-
work? What types of wireless will you find for connecting at your local
coffee shop?

out of date or the public key changes. This never happens with
the “big name” certificates built into your browser⎯you’ll see
this more often when a certificate is used, for example, in-house
on a company intranet and the administrator forgets to update
their certificates. If a certificate goes bad, your browser issues a
warning the next time you visit that site. To clear invalid certifi-
cates, you need to clear the SSL cache. The process varies on ev-
ery browser, but on Internet Explorer, go to the Content tab
under Internet Options and click the Clear SSL state button
(Figure 18.29).
Wireless Issues
Wireless networks add a whole level of additional security
headaches for techs to face, as you know from Chapter 16,
“Maintaining and Troubleshooting Networks.” Some of the
points to remember or to go back and look up are as follows:
■
Set up wireless encryption—at least WEP, but preferably
WPA or the more secure WPA2—and configure clients
to use them.
■
Disable DHCP and require your wireless clients to use a
static IP address.
■
If you need to use DHCP, only allot enough DHCP
addresses to meet the needs of your network to avoid unused
wireless connections.
■
Change the WAP’s SSID from default and disable SSID broadcast.
■
Filter by MAC address to allow only known clients on the network.
■
Change the default user name and password. Every hacker has
memorized the default user names and passwords.
■
Update the firmware as needed.
■
If available, make sure the WAP’s firewall settings are turned on.
Reporting
As a final weapon in your security arsenal, you need to report any security
issues so a network administrator or technician can take steps to make them
go away. You can set up two tools within Windows so that the OS reports
problems to you: Event Viewer and Auditing. You can then do your work
and report those problems. Let’s take a look.
Event Viewer
Event Viewer is Window’s default tattletale program, spilling the beans
about many things that happen on the system. You can find Event Viewer in
Administrative Tools in the Control Panel. By default, Event Viewer has
three sections, Application, Security, and System, and if you’ve down-
loaded Internet Explorer 7, you’ll see a fourth option for the browser,
Internet Explorer (Figure 18.30). As you’ll recall from Chapter 11, the most
Chapter 18: Computer Security
449
• Figure 18.29
The Internet Options Content tab

common use for Event Viewer is to view application or system errors for
troubleshooting (Figure 18.31).
One very cool feature of Event Viewer is that you can click the link to
take you to the online Help and Support Center at Microsoft.com, and the
software reports your error (Figure 18.32), checks the online database, and
comes back with a more or less useful explanation (Figure 18.33).

Typical application error message

Auditing
The Security section of Event Viewer doesn’t
show you anything by default. To unlock the full
potential of Event Viewer, you need to set up au-
diting. Auditing in the security sense means to tell
Windows to create an entry in the Security Log
when certain events happen, for example, a user
logs on—called event auditing —or tries to access
a certain file or folder—called object access audit-
ing . Figure 18.34 shows Event Viewer tracking
logon and logoff events.
The CompTIA A+ certification exams don’t
test you on creating a brilliant auditing policy
for your office—that’s what network adminis-
trators do. You simply need to know what au-
diting does and how to turn it on or off so that
you can provide support for the network ad-
ministrators in the field. To turn on auditing at
a local level, go to Local Security Settings in
Administrative Tools. Select Local Policies and
then click Audit Policies. Double-click one of
the policy options and select one or both of the

checkboxes. Figure 18.35 shows the
Audit object access dialog box.
Incidence Reporting
Once you’ve gathered data about a par-
ticular system or you’ve dealt with a
computer or network problem, you need
to complete the mission by telling your
supervisor. This is called
incidence re-
porting . Many companies have pre-
made forms that you simply fill out and
submit. Other places are less formal. Re-
gardless, you need to do this!
Incidence reporting does a couple of
things for you. First, it provides a record
of work you’ve done and accomplished.
Second, it provides a piece of informa-
tion that, when combined with other in-
formation that you might or might not
know, reveals a pattern or bigger prob-
lem to someone higher up the chain. A
seemingly innocuous security audit report, for example, might match other
such events in numerous places in the building at the same time and thus
show conscious, coordinated action rather than a glitch was at work.

Beyond A+
Security in Windows Vista
With Windows Vista, Microsoft offers great security features, including
tight control over user accounts and actions, a centralized security dialog,
and parental controls over content. And these just scratch the surface!
User Account Control
Windows XP made it too easy—and in fact almost necessary—to make your
primary account on a computer an Administrator account. Because Limited
Users can’t do common tasks such as run certain programs, install applica-
tions, update applications, update Windows, and so on, most users simply
created an Administrator-level account and logged in. Because such ac-
counts have full control over the computer, malware that slipped in with
that account could do a lot more harm.
Microsoft addressed this problem with the User Account Control (UAC).
This feature enables standard users to do common tasks and provides a per-
missions dialog (Figure 18.36) when standard users and administrators do
certain things that could potentially harm the computer (such as attempt to
install a program). Vista user accounts now function much more like user
accounts in Linux and Mac OS X.
Chapter 18: Computer Security
453
• Figure 18.36
Prompting for permission

Security Center
Microsoft has buffed up the Windows Security Center (WSC) for Windows
Vista to provide a one-stop shop for users to get information about critical
security issues (Figure 18.37). First introduced with Windows XP SP2, WSC
provides information about whether or not the Windows Firewall, Auto-
matic Updates, and an antivirus program are turned on. That’s just a start;
the WSC in Vista goes beyond to monitor other malware solutions, such as
the spyware- and adware-crushing Windows Defender. The WSC shows
Internet security settings and the status of UAC. It even shows third-party
security solutions installed, monitors whether they’re engaged, and pro-
vides an Update Now button so you can download the latest updates to
their signatures.
Parental Controls
With Parental Controls, you can monitor and limit the activities of any Stan-
dard User in Windows Vista, a feature that gives parents and managers an
excellent level of control over the content their children and employees can
access (Figure 18.38). Activity Reporting logs applications run or attempted
to run, Web sites visited or attempted to visit, any kind of files downloaded,
and more. You can block various Web sites by type or specific URL, or you
can allow only certain Web sites, a far more powerful option.
Parental Controls enable you to limit the time that Standard Users can
spend logged in. You can specify acceptable and unacceptable times of day

when Standard Users can log in. You can restrict access to types of games
and specific applications. For example, if you like playing rather gruesome
games filled with monsters and blood that you don’t want your kids to play,
you can simply block any games with certain ESRB ratings, such as T for
teen.
Other Security Features
Vista offers many other security features that you may or may not encoun-
ter, such as improved hard drive encryption. In a corporate environment,
you might run into Vista machines that completely block USB thumb drives.
Underneath all these security features runs an OS that protects essential sys-
tem files with far greater robustness than Windows XP or Windows 2000.

Chapter 18 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
computer security.
Analyzing the Threat
■
Threats to your data come from two sources:
accidents and malicious people.
■
Unauthorized access occurs when a user accesses
resources in an unauthorized way. Not all
unauthorized access is malicious, and some is even
accidental. Authorized access can lead to data
destruction by users who do not intend to be
malicious. When users have access to a file or
database, they typically believe the system won’t
let them make any changes they are not authorized
to make.
■
Windows XP Home has only two types of user
accounts: administrative and limited. If you need
to control access, you are better off using Windows
XP Professional or Windows 2000.
■
Computers, hard drives, and power all fail. As a
tech, you need to plan for redundancy in these
areas. You also need to protect your computers
against viruses distributed through the network and
removable media. You should back up data, make
sure retired hard drives and optical discs don’t have
sensitive data, implement good access policies, and
implement methods for tracking computer usage.
Local Control
■
In addition to backing up everyone’s Document
and Settings folders, make sure to back up files
users have stored outside their Documents and
Settings folder. In server environments, be sure to
back up the System State data, which includes
portions of the Registry, security settings, desktop
files and folders, and the default user. Backups
should be stored off-site.
■
When retiring a system and migrating the data to a
new machine, three principles should be followed:
migrate user and data information in a secure
environment, remove data from hard drives that
will be stored or donated, and recycle old
equipment rather than throwing it in the trash.
■
To migrate data securely, supervise the file copy
rather than setting it to run unattended. Use a
disc-wiping utility to remove remnants and make
old data virtually impossible to recover. Lastly,
your new system is not considered secure until all
passwords are in place.
■
Be environmentally responsible: recycle products
such as paper and printer cartridges. Some
hardware, such as a computer monitor, contains
toxic or hazardous materials. Donate these items to
an organization that will use them, or contact a
company that specializes in the disposal of
hazardous materials or computer components.
■
Most computer attacks are accomplished through
social engineering rather than hacking. Telephone
scams are one of the most common social
engineering tactics. Dumpster driving involves
physically going through an organization’s trash
looking for documents that might reveal user
names, passwords, or other sensitive information.
Be sure to secure your computer equipment in a
locked room to prevent physical theft.
■
Controlling access to programs, data, and other
computing resources is the key to securing your
system. Access control includes five interlinked
areas: physical security, authentication, file system,
users and groups, and security policies.
■
Store computers with sensitive data in a locked
room, and never walk away from your computer
while logged in. Log out, or lock the computer by
pressing CTRL-L.
■
For software authentication, every user account
should have a password to protect against
unauthorized access. Additionally, CMOS setup
should have a password for any computer in a public
place.
456
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

■
For hardware authentication, try smart cards or
biometric devices. Smart cards are the size of credit
cards and contain circuitry that can be used to
identify the card holder. Biometric devices identify
users by physical characteristics such as
fingerprints or retinal scans. Some smart cards use
radio frequency identification to transmit
authentication information, so users don’t have to
insert something into a computer or card reader.
■
All hard drives should be formatted with NTFS,
not FAT32. Use the CONVERT command-line
utility to convert a drive from FAT to NTFS
without losing data.
■
Windows controls access with user accounts and
groups. Users are assigned user accounts, user
accounts are assigned to a group or groups, and
groups are granted permission to resources. Using
NTFS enables the highest level of control over local
data resources.
Network Security
■
Accounts should be given permissions to access
only what they need, no more. Unused accounts
should be disabled.
■
When a user account is a member of several
groups, and permissions have been granted to
groups, the user account will have a set of
combined permissions that may conflict. The
resulting permissions that ultimately control access
are referred to as the effective permissions.
■
Make sure to lock down the default Everyone
group, as all users are automatically members of
this group. Windows 2000 gives full control to the
Everyone group by default. Never use the default
Everyone or Users groups or the default Guest
account unless you intend to permit all those
accounts access to resources.
■
Policies control permissions for activities, such as
installing software, access to a command prompt,
or time of day a user can log on. A policy is usually
applied to a user account, computer account, or a
group. Use the Local Security Settings tool to
manage policies for an individual computer.
■
Group Policy enables you to control such things as
setting each computer in a domain to use the same
wallpaper or deploy software. Commonly used
policies include Prevent Registry Edits, Prevent
Access to the Command Prompt, Log On Locally,
and Minimum Password Length.
■
Malware includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses,
adware, and grayware—all of which can wreak
havoc on your system.
■
A virus is a piece of malicious software that gets
passed from computer to computer and is
designed to attach itself to another program on
your computer. Trojans are freestanding programs
that do something other than what the user expects
it to do when run, such as expecting a game to run
but erasing CMOS Settings instead. A worm is a
freestanding program that takes advantage of
security flaws and copies itself over and over
again, thereby bogging down a network.
■
To help protect a computer from malware, make
sure to run up-to-date antivirus software, use a
firewall, and apply all security patches for your
software and operating system. Run Windows
Update automatically, or at least weekly if you
choose to configure it for manual updates.
■
Antivirus software works in active mode to scan
your file system for viruses and in passive mode by
monitoring your computer’s activity and checking
for viruses in response to an action, such as
running a program or downloading a file.
Antivirus software detects boot-sector viruses by
comparing the drive’s boot sector to a standard
boot sector. To detect executable viruses, a library
of virus signatures is used. Macro viruses are
detected through virus signatures or the presence
of certain macro commands that are known
macro viruses.
■
Polymorph viruses attempt to change their
signature to prevent detection by antivirus
software. Fortunately, the scrambled code itself can
be used as a signature. A checksum, based on file
contents, can be created for every file on the drive.
If the checksum changes, it is a sign of a virus
infection. Most stealth viruses are boot sector
viruses that hide from antivirus software.
Chapter 18: Computer Security
457

■
The best way to prevent damage from a virus is to
keep from getting a virus in the first place. Use
your passive antivirus shield, scan the PC daily,
know where software has come from before you
load it, and keep your antivirus definitions
updated. Don’t view e-mail messages in a preview
pane, and only download files from sites you know
to be safe.
■
Unsolicited e-mail is called spam. Never post your
e-mail address on the Internet, as over 97 percent
of spam comes from e-mail addresses posted
online. Spam filters can block spam at the mail
server or at your computer. You can set most
e-mail programs to block e-mail sent from specific
people or to a specific person.
■
Irritating Web browser problems include pop-ups,
spyware, and adware. Many pop-ups remove the
navigation aids from the browser window or
mimic Windows dialog boxes. To safely close a
pop-up, right-click the pop-up’s Taskbar icon and
choose Close, or press ALT-TAB until the pop-up
window is active, and then press ALT-F4 to close it.
■
Spyware can use your computer’s resources to run
distributed computing applications, capture
keystrokes to steal passwords, or worse. Spyware
typically disguises itself as useful utilities, so be
vigilant about what you install. Some spyware can
be removed via Add/Remove Programs, but for
stubborn spyware use a third-party tool such as
Lavasoft’s Ad-Aware or PepiMK’s Spybot Search
& Destroy.
■
Grayware leaches network bandwidth, although
some consider the programs beneficial. Peer-to-
peer file-sharing programs that enable a lot of
users to upload portions of files on demand might
seem useful to someone, but these programs can
eat up a significant portion of the network
bandwidth, causing other users or programs to
respond slowly to network or Internet applications.
■
Hardware firewalls protect networks by hiding IP
addresses and blocking TCP/IP ports. Windows
XP comes with a built-in software firewall that is
accessible from the Control Panel Security Center
applet.
■
Encryption makes network packets unreadable by
hackers who intercept network traffic. You are
especially vulnerable when using the Internet over
a public network. Modern operating systems use
Kerberos to encrypt authentication credentials over
a local network.
■
PAP sends passwords in clear text, so it is not very
safe. CHAP is the most common remote access
protocol, in which the serving system challenges
the remote system with a secret, like a password.
MS-CHAP is Microsoft’s version of CHAP and
uses a more advanced encryption protocol.
■
Network data can be encrypted similar to
authentication credentials. Microsoft’s encryption
method of choice is called IPSec. Netscape’s Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) creates secure Web sites.
Microsoft’s HTTPS protocol incorporates SSL into
HTTP. Web sites whose URL begins with HTTPS://
are used to encrypt credit card purchases.
■
To secure a wireless network, use wireless
encryption and disable DHCP. Require wireless
clients to use a static IP address or allot only
enough DHCP addresses to meet the needs of your
network. Definitely change the default
administrator user name and password on the
WAP.
■
Use Event Viewer to track activity on your system.
Event Viewer offers three sections: Application,
Security, and System. The Security section doesn’t
show you everything by default, so it is good
practice to enable event auditing and object
auditing. Event auditing creates an entry in the
Security Log when certain events happen, like a
user logging on. Object Auditing creates entries in
response to object access, like someone trying to
access a certain file or folder.
■
Incidence reporting means telling your supervisor
about the data you’ve gathered regarding a
computer or network problem. This provides a
record of what you’ve done and accomplished. It
also provides information that, when combined
with other information you may or may not know,
may reveal a pattern or bigger problem to someone
higher up the chain.

hen a mission-critical computer goes down, regardless of the industry,
people get upset. Workers can’t work, so they feel guilty. Employers
can’t get product out on time, so they feel anxious. Supervisors blame
employees for fouling things up, or at least the employees fear such blame, even
if they did not break the machine.
Into this charged atmosphere comes the tech, ready to fix the computer and
move on to the next challenge. Accomplishing this task, however, requires three
things: First, a good tech must know the broken machine inside and out—how
it’s supposed to work when working properly. Second, the tech has to calm the
workers and supervisors, and get answers to questions to gain relevant
information about the problem. Third, the tech must troubleshoot the problem
and fix the machine.
This chapter starts with an overview of how computers work and then dives
into a section on dealing with customers and how to get them to tell you what
you need to know and smile about it. The chapter wraps up with a proven
troubleshooting methodology to help you figure out the source of problems and
point you to the fix quickly.

■How Computers Work
You’ve spent a lot of time going through this book, reading about technolo-
gies and components in great detail. Each chapter contained information
and methodologies for the components contained in that chapter. With each
chapter, you added more and more information about the pieces that make
up the personal computer today.
In this chapter, I want you to distill that knowledge, to think about the
computer as a coherent machine. Each of the computer’s components works
together to enable people to produce some amazing things.
To master the art of troubleshooting as a PC tech, you need to approach a
technical problem and answer one question: “What can it be? What can be
causing this problem?” (Okay, that was two questions, but you get the idea.)
Because every process involves multiple components, you must understand
the interconnectedness of those components. If Jane can’t print, for example,
what could it be? Connectivity? Drivers? Paper jam? Slow network connec-
tion? Frozen application? Solar flares? Let’s look at the process.
Computing Process
When you run a program, your computer goes through three of the four
stages of the
computing process : input, processing, and output
(Figure 19.1). Input requires specific devices, such as the keyboard and
mouse, that enable you to tell the computer to do something, such as
open a program or type a word. The operating system (OS) provides an
interface and tools so that the microprocessor and other chips can process
your request. The image on the monitor or sound from the speakers
effectively tell you that the computer has interpreted your command and
spit out the result. The fourth stage, storage, comes into play when you
want to save a document and when you first open programs and other
files.
Making this process work, though, requires the complex interaction
of many components, including multiple pieces of hardware and layers
of software. As a tech, you need to understand all the components and
how they work together so when something doesn’t work right, you can

Printing Process
You learned all about the printing process in Chapter 15, “Maintaining
and Troubleshooting Printers,” but now think in terms of the comput-
ing process. Does the computing process translate when applied to
printers? How? If a user can’t print, how does knowledge of the com-
puting process help you troubleshoot the printing process?
If you look at the CompTIA
A+ exam objectives for the
Essentials, IT Technician, and
specialization exams, you’ll
notice that the objectives
covered in this chapter are, for
all intents and purposes, virtu-
ally the same for each exam.

track down the source and fix it. A look at a modern program reveals that
even a relatively simple-seeming action or change on the screen requires
many things to happen within the computer.
Games such as Second Life (Figure 19.2) are huge, taking up multiple
gigabytes of space on an Internet server. They simply won’t fit into the RAM
in most computers, so developers have figured out ways to minimize RAM
usage.
In Second Life, for example, you move through the online world in a se-
ries of more or less seamlessly connected areas. Crossing a bridge from one
island to another triggers the game to update the information you’re about
to see on the new island quickly, so you won’t be out of the action and the il-
lusion of being in the game world remains intact. Here’s what happens
when you press the W key on your keyboard and your character steps across
the invisible zone line.
The keyboard controller reads the grid of your keyboard and, on
discovering your input, sends the information to the CPU through the
wires of the motherboard (Figure 19.3). The CPU understands the keyboard
Chapter 19: The Complete PC Tech

Second Life
Second Life is a massively
multiplayer online role-playing
game (MMORPG) that offers a
unique twist on the genre. You
can create just about anything
you can imagine, as far as your
time and talent can take you.
Second Life has a functioning
economy that spills out into the
real world, meaning you can buy
and sell things within the game
and turn that into real US dol-
lars, although the more common
scenario is to spend real money
to get virtual possessions.

controller because of a small program it loaded into RAM from the system
BIOS stored on the system ROM chip on the motherboard when you first
booted the computer.
The CPU and the application determine what should happen in the
game, and on discovering that your character is about to cross the zone line,
they trigger a whole series of actions. The application sends the signal to the
OS that it needs a specific area loaded into RAM. The OS sends a signal to
the CPU that it needs data stored on the hard drive plus information stored
on the Second Life servers. The CPU then sends the commands to the hard
drive controller for it to grab the proper stored data and send it to RAM,
while at the same time sending a command to the NIC to download the up-
dated information (Figure 19.4).
The hard drive controller tells the hard drive to cough up the
data—megabytes worth—and then sends that data through the mother-
board to the memory controller,
which puts it into RAM and com-
municates with the CPU when it’s
finished. The network card and
network operating system com-
municate with the Second Life
servers and download the neces-
sary updated information. The
CPU then uses the application and
OS to process the new data, send-
ing video data to the video card
and sound data to the sound card,
again through the wires on the
motherboard (Figure 19.5).

Hard Drive Technologies
You learned about several different hard drive technologies way back
in Chapter 8, so turn there now and see if you can answer these ques-
tions. If an application stumbles or hesitates on the “load from the hard
drive” section of the computing process, what could be the problem?
Which hard drive technology offers better throughput than other com-
mon technologies? What would you recommend to a client who wanted
to upgrade?

The video card processor puts the incoming data into its RAM, processes
the data, and then sends out commands to the monitor to update the screen.
The sound card processor likewise
processes the data and sends out
commands to the speakers to play
a new sound (Figure 19.6).
For all of this to work, the PC
has to have electricity, so the di-
rect current (DC) provided by the
power supply and the alternating
current
(AC)
provided
to
the
power supply must both be the
proper voltage and amperage.
Finally, because Second Life is
a network application, the OS has
to send information through the
NIC and onto the Internet to up-
date everyone else’s computer.
That way, the other characters in
the game world see you move for-
ward a step (Figure 19.7).

Tech Tip
Video Counts
Windows Vista has raised the bar
on video demands in a big way, so
the video card in your users’ sys-
tems can make a remarkable dif-
ference on their experience. Vista
uses the video card to produce
many of the cool visual effects of
the interface. This means that a
low-end video card in an other-
wise serviceable machine can
cause Vista to misbehave. That’s
not a good thing. Unless your cli-
ent is gaming, there’s no reason
to drop US$300 or more on a
video card, but assembling or rec-
ommending a system with yester-
day’s video is not necessarily a
good thing!

Updating the screen and speakers

your speakers. Within a few seconds, with the data describing the new is-
land fully downloaded and processed, the world on your monitor looks
very different (Figure 19.9). That’s when all goes well. Many megabytes of
data have flowed from your hard drive and across the Internet, been pro-
cessed by multiple processors, and sent to the monitor and the speakers.
To keep the action continuous and unbroken, Second Life, like many
current online games, uses a process of continuous or stream loading : your
computer constantly downloads updated information and data from the
Second Life servers, so the world you see changes with every step you take.
When done right, stream loading can do some amazing things. In the
GameCube game Zelda, for example, the game anticipates where you will
go next and loads that new area into RAM before you take the step. You can
be in one area and use a telescope to zoom in on another fully developed
area (Figure 19.10), making the experience amazingly seamless, just like
real life.

Troubleshooting
Good techs understand the components involved in inputting,
processing, and outputting data, including the devices that store
data, such as hard drives. That’s because if something doesn’t
work properly, you can start answering the ultimate trouble-
shooting question—what can it be?—accurately. If your screen
freezes or the sound goes wonky, where in the process is the
problem located?
As you go into any troubleshooting scenario, always keep the
computing process in mind. This helps you sort through possibil-
ities quickly and accurately. If you know all the stages, you won’t
miss a simple step, such as figuring out that a user can’t print be-
cause the cleaning service accidentally turned off the print server
the night before, or waste time reinstalling printer drivers when
the real issue is a stalled print job in the print queue.

■Dealing with Customers
When you deal with users, managers, and owners who are frustrated and
upset because a computer or network is down and they can’t work, your job
requires you to take on the roles of detective and psychologist. It takes skill
to talk with frazzled and confused people and get answers to questions
about how the PC got into the state it’s in. It’s important to be able to com-
municate clearly and effectively. Plus, you need to follow the rules of
tech-person decorum, acting with personal integrity and respect for the cus-
tomer. Finally, use assertive communication to empathize with and educate
the user. Great techs spend the time needed to develop these essential skills.
Eliciting Answers
Your job as a tech is to get the computer fixed, and the best way to start that
process is to determine what the computer is doing or not doing. You must
start by talking to the customer. Allow the customer to explain the problem
fully while you record the information. Once the person has described the
situation, you must then ask questions. This process is called
eliciting
answers .
Although each person is different, most users with a malfunctioning
computer or peripheral will be afraid and often defensive about the prob-
lem. To overcome this initial attitude, you need to ask the right questions
and listen to the customer’s answers. Then ask the proper follow-up
questions.
Always avoid accusatory questions because they won’t help you in the
least. “What did you do?” generally gets a confused or defensive “Nothing”
in reply, which doesn’t get you closer to solving the problem. First, ask ques-
tions that help clarify the situation. Repeat what you think is the problem af-
ter you’ve listened all the way through the user’s story.
Follow up with fact-seeking questions. “When did it last work?” “Has it
ever worked in this way?” “Has any software changed recently?” “Any new
hardware?”
By keeping your questions friendly and factual, you show the user that
you won’t accuse them or judge their actions. You also show them that

Analyze Your Apps
What applications do you use on your computer? What applications do
your clients or potential clients use? Analyzing them in terms of the
computing process can help elevate your troubleshooting game by a
huge factor. Take for example Microsoft Excel, a program designed to
let you take numbers and turn them into charts, among other things.
When you sit down to work in Excel, you load it from the hard drive
into memory; then you input information via the keyboard and col-
umns with the mouse. Every click requires the CPU to analyze and up-
date RAM and the video card information.
This entire chapter applies to
Essentials, IT Technician, and
Help Desk Technician exams.
Expect one out of every five
questions on the 220-603 exam

you’re there to help them. After the initial tension drops away, you’ll often
get more information, for instance, a recitation of something the user might
have tried or changed. These clues can help lead to a quick resolution of the
problem.
It’s important to remember that you may know all about computer tech-
nology, but the user probably does not. This means they will often use
vague and/or incorrect terms to describe a particular computer component
or function. That’s just the way it works, so don’t bother to correct the user.
Wherever possible, avoid using jargon, acronyms, or abbreviations specific
to computers. They simply confuse the already upset user. Just ask direct,
factual questions in a friendly tone using simple, non-jargon language to
zero in on what the user was trying to accomplish and what happened when
things went wrong. Point at the machine or go to a working PC to have the
user show what went wrong or what he or she did or tried to do.
Although you don’t want to overwhelm them, people do usually want
to get a handle on what you are doing⎯although in a simplified way. Don’t
be afraid to use simple analogies or concepts to give them an idea of what is
happening. If you have the time (and the skills), use drawings, equipment,
and other visual aids to make technical concepts more clear. If a customer is
a “closet tech” and is really digging for answers⎯to the point that it’s affect-
ing your ability to do your job⎯compliment their initiative and then direct
them to outside training opportunities. Better yet, tell them where they can
get a copy of this book!
Integrity
A computer tech must bring integrity to his or her job, just like any other
service professional. Treat anything said to you as a personal confidence,
not to be repeated to coworkers or bosses. Respect the privacy and property
of the user.
You have a lot of power when you sit in front of someone’s computer.
You can readily read private e-mail, discover Web sites surfed, and more.
With a click of the Start button, you can know the last five programs the user
ran, including Word and Solitaire, and the last few documents he or she
worked on. Don’t do this. You really don’t want to know! Plus, if you get
caught violating a customer’s privacy, you’ll not only lose credibility and re-
spect, you could lose your job.
Passwords are a big issue for techs. We have to reboot computers and ac-
cess shares and other jobs that require passwords. The rule here is to avoid
learning other folks’ passwords at all costs. If you know a password to access a
mission-critical machine, and that machine ends up compromised or with
data missing, who might be blamed? You, that’s who, so avoid learning
passwords! If you only need a password once, let the user type it in for you.
If you anticipate accessing something multiple times (the more usual situa-
tion), ask the user to change his or her password temporarily.
It’s funny, but people assume ownership of things they use at work.
John in accounting doesn’t call the computer he uses anything but “my PC.”
The phone on Susie’s desk isn’t the company phone, it’s “Susie’s phone.”
Regardless of the logic or illogic involved with this sense of ownership, a
tech needs to respect that feeling. You’ll never go wrong if you follow the
472
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

Golden Rule or the ethic of reciprocity : “Do unto others as you would have
them do unto you.” In a tech’s life, this can translate as “treat people’s things
as you would have other people treat yours.” Don’t use or touch anything—
keyboard, printer, laptop, monitor, mouse, phone, pen, paper, or cube toy—
without first asking permission. Follow this rule at all times, even when the
customer isn’t looking!
Beyond basic manners, never assume that just because you are comfort-
able with friendly or casual behavior, the customer will be, too. Even an ap-
parently casual user will still expect you to behave with professional
decorum. On the flip side, don’t allow a user to put you in an awkward or
even potentially dangerous or illegal situation. Never socialize with cus-
tomers while on the clock. Never do work outside the scope of your as-
signed duties without the prior approval of your supervisor (when possible
in such cases, try to direct users to someone who can help them). You are not
a babysitter⎯never volunteer to “watch the kids” while the customer leaves
the job site, or tolerate a potentially unsafe situation if a customer isn’t prop-
erly supervising a child. Concentrate on doing your job safely and
efficiently, and maintain professional integrity.
Respect
The final key in communicating with the user revolves around respect . You
don’t do his or her job, but should respect that job and person as an essential
cog in your organization. Communicate with users the way you would like
them to communicate with you were the roles reversed. Again, this follows
the ethic of reciprocity.
Generally, IT folks are there to support the people doing a company’s
main business. You are there to serve their needs, and all things being equal,
to do so at their convenience, not yours.
Don’t assume the world stops the moment you walk in the door and that
you may immediately interrupt their work to do yours. Although most cus-
tomers are thrilled and motivated to help you the moment you arrive, this
may not always be the case. Ask the magic question, “May I start working
on the problem now?” Give your customer a chance to wrap up, shut down,
or do anything else necessary to finish his or her business and make it safe
for you to do yours.
Engage the user with the standard rules of civil conversation. Take the
time to listen. Don’t interrupt a story, but rather let it play out. You might
hear something that leads to resolving the problem. Use an even, non-accu-
satory tone, and although it’s okay to try to explain a problem if the user
asks, never condescend, and never argue.
Remain positive in the face of adversity. Don’t get defensive if you can’t
figure something out quickly and the user starts hassling you. Remember
that an angry customer isn’t really angry with you⎯he’s just frustrated⎯so
don’t take his anger personally. Take it in stride; smile and assure him that
computer troubleshooting sometimes takes awhile!
Avoid letting outside interruptions take your focus away from the user
and his or her computer problem. Things that break your concentration
slow down the troubleshooting process immensely. Plus, customers will
feel insulted if you start chatting on your cell phone with your significant
other about a movie date later that night when you’re supposed to be fixing
Chapter 19: The Complete PC Tech
473

their computers! You’re not being paid to socialize, so turn those cell phones
and pagers to vibrate. That’s why the technogods created voicemail. Never
take any call except one that is potentially urgent. If a call is potentially ur-
gent, explain the urgency to the customer, step away, and deal with the call
as quickly as possible.
If you discover that the user caused the problem, either through igno-
rance or by accident, don’t minimize the importance of the problem, but
don’t be judgmental or insulting about the cause. We all screw up some-
times, and these kinds of mistakes are your job security! You get paid because
people make mistakes and machines break. Chances are you’ll be back at that
workstation six months or a year later, fixing something else. By becoming
the user’s advocate and go-to person, you create a better work environment.
If it’s a mistaken action that caused the problem, explain in a positive and
supportive way how to do the task correctly and then have the user go
through the process while you are there to reinforce what you said.
Assertive Communication
In many cases, a PC problem is due to user error or neglect. As a technician,
you must show users the error of their ways without creating anger or con-
flict. You do this by using assertive communication. Assertive communica-
tion is a technique that isn’t pushy or bossy, but it’s also not the language of
a pushover. Assertive communication first requires you show the other per-
son that you understand and appreciate the importance of his or her feel-
ings. Use statements such as “I know how frustrating it feels to lose data” or
“I understand how infuriating it is when the network goes out and you can’t
get your job done.” Statements like these cool off the situation and let the
customer know you are on his or her side.
The second part of assertive communication is making sure the problem
is clearly stated⎯without accusing the user directly: “Not keeping up with
defragmenting your hard drive slows it down” or “Help me understand
how the network cable keeps getting unplugged during your lunch hour.”
Lastly, tell the user what you need from them to prevent this error in the fu-
ture: “Please call me whenever you hear that buzzing sound” or “Please
check the company’s approved software list before installing anything.” Al-
ways use “I” and “me,” and never make judgments. “I can’t promise the
keyboard will work well if it’s always getting dirty” is much better than
“Stop eating cookies over the keyboard, you slob!”
■Troubleshooting Methodology
Following a sound troubleshooting methodology helps you figure out and
fix problems quickly. But because troubleshooting is as much art as science,
I can’t give you a step-by-step list of things to try in a particular order.
You’ve got to be flexible.
First, make sure you have the proper tools for the job. Second, back up
everything important before doing repair work. And third, analyze the
problem, test your solution, and complete your troubleshooting.

Tech Toolkit
In the Essentials course you learned the basic parts of a tech toolkit
(Figure 19.11): a Phillips-head screwdriver and a few other useful tools,
such as a Torx wrench and a pair of tweezers. You also should carry some
computer components.
Always carry several field replaceable units (FRUs) —a fancy way to say
spare parts—when going to a job site or workstation. Having several known
good components on hand enables you to swap out a potentially bad piece
of hardware to see if that’s the problem. Different technicians will have dif-
ferent FRUs. A printer specialist might carry a number of different fusers,
for example. Your employer will also have a big effect on what is an FRU
and what is not. I generally carry a couple of RAM sticks (DDR and DDR2),
a PCI video card, a NIC, and a 300-watt power supply.
Backup
In many troubleshooting situations, it’s important to back up critical files
before making changes to a system. To some extent, this is a matter of proper
ongoing maintenance. If you’re in charge of a set of machines for your com-
pany, for example, make sure they’re set to back up critical files automati-
cally on a regular basis.
If you run into a partially functional system, where you might have to
reinstall the OS but can access the hard drive, then you should definitely
back up essential data, such as e-mail, browser favorites, important docu-
ments, and any data not stored on a regularly backed-up server. Because
you can always boot to a copy of Windows and go to the Recovery Console,
you should never lose essential data, barring full-blown hard drive death.
Steps
Troubleshooting a computer problem can create a great day for a computer
tech—if he or she goes about solving it systematically and logically. Too
many techs get into a rut, thinking that when symptom A occurs, the prob-
lem must be caused by problem A and require solution A. They might even
be right nine times out of ten, but if you think this way, you’re in trouble

Tech Tip
Why PCI?
I keep a PCI video card in my kit
because every computer made in
the past ten years has PCI slots. If
you run into a system with video
problems, you can almost always
simply slap in the PCI video card
and discover quickly whether or
not the AGP or PCIe video card
or card slot is a problem. If the
computer boots up with the PCI
video card but fails on the AGP
card, for example, you know that
either the AGP card or slot is
causing the problem.
• Figure 19.11
Typical technician toolkit
The CompTIA A+ certification
exams assume that all techs
should back up systems every
time before working on them,
even though that’s not how it
works in the real world.
Dead hard drives retain their
data, so you can recover it—if
you’re willing to pay a lot of
money. Having a good backup
in place makes a lot more
economic sense!

when the problem is really Z and requires a completely different solution.
What do you do when the fix doesn’t work and you’re sure it’s got to be
problem A? Your customer won’t be happy, you’ll end up frustrated or em-
barrassed, and you still won’t have the problem fixed. Follow the right
methodology: analyze, test, and complete your task.
Analyze
Everything starts with analyzing the problem. Because you know how the
process should work, when you run into a computer problem, the first ques-
tion you should ask is, “What can it be?” Don’t limit yourself in the initial
analysis, but examine all possibilities.
Make sure you understand the nature of the problem first. A big portion
of the initial fact-finding involves talking to the user with your newly-honed
customer communication skills. Practice asking friendly, factual questions
to get the results you want.
When you run into big problems, such as a completely dead PC, or some
weird issue that involves networking as well as a local machine, break the
problem down into smaller parts. For a dead PC, for example, organize your
inquiry into categories, like this:
■
Power
Check the AC connections and power switches on the
power supply and UPS or surge suppressor.
■
Connectivity
Check inside the box to make sure nothing is
unplugged.
■
CMOS
If you’ve got power (you see an LED lit up, for example),
then check CMOS to see if the hard drive shows up.
■
Operating system
If you have some life in the PC, but get no boot
option, then try booting to the CD and running the recovery console.
Check to see if you can access the hard drive. If you have a boot
option, then try booting to Safe mode or Last Known Good
Configuration.
By breaking the problem into discrete chunks, you make a big problem
more manageable. You can determine whether the problem is caused by a
hardware failure, connection problem, or perhaps an issue with the operat-
ing system or other software.
Test
Once you determine what might have caused the problem, test your theo-
ries. The testing procedure follows a simple set of rules:
First, check the easy stuff. Is the failed device plugged in? Is it turned on?
Does the printer have paper?
Second, use a process of elimination to home in on the problem. Use a
notepad to write down what you’ve tried and what effect that effort had. Do
one thing at a time. If you go into CMOS and make a whole series of changes
to various settings, for example, and then the computer works, how do you
know what was wrong? You can’t know when you make multiple changes.
Worse yet, you risk breaking something else while fixing the first problem!
476
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

Third, if hardware seems to be the problem, swap out the suspect parts
with known good parts from your stash of FRUs. With a dead or dying piece
of hardware, you can generally get almost immediate results. A fried stick of
RAM, for example, can create a dead PC. Pop in a good stick, and you’ll
have a functional machine.
Complete
Once you finish the testing phase, you can complete the troubleshooting
process with four more steps: evaluate, escalate, clean up, and document.
First, evaluate the results of your actions. Run the system through its
paces; don’t just get it working and walk away. Make certain the user can ac-
complish his or her primary tasks before you consider a job complete. If you
can’t get the computer or peripheral working in a fairly short period of time,
take the second step and escalate the problem—in other words, call for
help. Because you’ve taken notes on the symptoms and each troubleshoot-
ing step you’ve tried, you can very quickly get a more senior tech up to
speed on the problem and get suggestions for where you might go next.
Third, clean up the work environment. If you installed a drive, for ex-
ample, do the right thing and tie off the ribbon cables. If you see a mess of ca-
bles coming out of the back of the PC or running across the floor, take a
moment to tie them off. Good cable management does more than leave your
clients with a nice-looking computer and workstation area, it also helps
prevent accidents.
Finally, document your results. Many companies have specific forms
for you to use to describe the problem and its resolution. If not, then make
some for yourself and other techs in your workplace. Documenting prob-
lems helps you track the troubleshooting history of a machine over time, en-
abling you to make longer-term determinations about retiring it or
changing out more parts. If you and fellow techs fix a specific problem with
Mary’s machine several times, for example, you might decide to swap out
her whole system rather than fix it a fourth time.
Documenting helps fellow techs if they have to follow up on a task you
didn’t finish or troubleshoot a machine that you’ve worked on previously.
The reverse is also true. If you get a call about Frank’s computer, for exam-
ple, and check the records to find other service calls on his computer, you
might find that the fix for a particular problem is already documented. This
is especially true for user-generated problems. Having documentation of
what you did also means you don’t have to rely on your memory when your
coworker asks what you did to fix the weird problem with Jane’s computer
a year ago!
Documenting also comes into play when you or a user has an accident
on site. If your colleague Joe drops a monitor on his foot and broke both the
monitor and his foot, for example, you need to fill out an incident report, just
like you would with any kind of accident—electrical, chemical, or physical.
An incident report should detail what happened and where it happened.
This helps your supervisors take the appropriate actions quickly and
efficiently.
Chapter 19: The Complete PC Tech
477
The power supply provides
the only exception to the instant
gratification rule of part swap-
ping. If you have a wonky com-
puter that has intermittent
problems, swap out the power
supply and leave your FRU in
the computer for a half day or
longer. You need the user to
road test the PC and report if he
or she has the same problems.
Know the four steps for com-
pleting troubleshooting: evalu-
ate, escalate, clean up, and
document.

Chapter 19 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
working as a tech.
How Computers Work
■
Good techs must know how their systems are
supposed to work when working properly, must
be able to calm workers and supervisors and get
answers to relevant questions, and must be able to
troubleshoot and fix computer problems. A
question you must be able to answer is “What can
be causing this problem?”
■
When you run a program, computers work
through three stages of the four-stage computing
process: input, processing, and output. Input
requires special input devices such as a keyboard
or mouse. The operating system provides the
interface and tools so that the CPU and other chips
can process requests. The output devices, such as
the monitor, speakers, or printer, tell you the
computer has interpreted your commands. For all
this to work, the PC must have electricity and
proper AC/DC voltage and amperage.
■
When a keyboard key is pressed, the keyboard
controller reads the grid of your keyboard and
discovers your input, and then sends the information
to the CPU. The CPU understands the keyboard
controller because of a small program that was
loaded into RAM from the ROM BIOS on the
motherboard when the PC booted up.
■
Good techs understand the components involved
in inputting, processing, and outputting, including
the devices that store data, such as hard drives.
Dealing with Customers
■
The first step in fixing a computer problem is
talking to the client. To determine what the
computer is doing or not doing, first allow the
client to describe the situation; then ask leading
questions to elicit answers.
■
Most people feel defensive when asked to explain
computer problems, so it is your job to put them at
ease by asking the right kinds of questions. Questions
like “What did you do?” generally aren’t much help.
A better question might be, “When did it last work?”
By taking the user explicitly out of the question, you
show that you aren’t accusing or judging.
■
Refrain from using computer jargon, acronyms, or
abbreviations, as a user is unlikely to be familiar
with them and may get confused. Ask simple
questions that don’t use technical lingo. Have the
user physically demonstrate what is happening or
what is not happening.
■
Treat every incident with integrity. Respect the
confidentiality of what a user said to you and don’t
repeat it to coworkers. Don’t abuse your power as
a tech. Although you could read private e-mail, see
the last several programs someone used, or see the
last few documents someone worked on, don’t do
it. Your credibility may be damaged beyond repair.
■
Avoid learning other people’s passwords. Have the
user type in any passwords for you. If you’ll need
the same password entered many times, have the
user temporarily change their password for you to
use, and then have them change it back when you
are done working.
■
People are protective of their things. Don’t touch
anything unless necessary—that means the
keyboard, printer, monitor, phone, pen, stapler, or
anything else.
■
Don’t allow yourself to be put in a questionable
situation. You’re a tech, not a babysitter.
■
Don’t assume the customer is ready for you to begin
upon your arrival. Ask the customer if it is okay for
you to start work, and allow them to close any files
and exit any programs. Don’t interrupt customers.
Let them finish their story. Although you may think
it is irrelevant, there may be important information.
■
Stay positive, don’t get defensive, and don’t take a
customer’s anger personally. Remind the customer
that troubleshooting takes time. Avoid letting
outside interruptions take your focus away from
the job; set your cell phone and pager to vibrate.
While working with a customer, only take phone
calls that are urgent. Explain the urgency to your
customer and deal with the call as quickly as
possible.
478
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: PC Technician (Exams 220-602, 220-603, & 220-604)

■
If you determine the problem was caused by the user,
don’t be judgmental or insulting. Explain to the user
how to do the task they wanted to accomplish, and
have the user go through the process while you
supervise to reinforce what you said.
■
Use assertive, but not pushy or bossy, communi-
cation. Show the person you understand his or her
feelings and appreciate their importance. Make
sure the problem is clearly stated without accusing
the user directly. Tell the user what you need from
them to prevent this error in the future. Use “I”
statements rather than accusatory statements.
Troubleshooting Methodology
■
Troubleshooting is more art than science, and as
such, there is no step-by-step list of actions to
follow. You need to be flexible.
■
Carry a well-stocked tech toolkit. You should also
carry several FRUs. The FRUs you carry will
depend on what kind of tech you are, but in
general, most techs should carry a few sticks each
of DDR and DDR2 RAM, a PCI video card, a NIC,
and a 300-watt power supply.
■
Be sure to back up critical files before making
changes to a system. Back up e-mail, favorites,
personal documents, and any data not stored on a
regularly backed-up server.
■
Begin troubleshooting by analyzing the problem.
Make sure you understand the problem. Talk to
the client and use your communication skills to
gather facts.
■
It is helpful to break down large problems into
smaller categories. For example, if a PC is
completely dead or there is an issue involving both
the network and the local machine, organize your
inquiry into smaller categories including power,
connectivity, CMOS, and operating system.
■
Once you determine what might have caused the
problem, test your theories. First, check the easy
stuff, like is the device plugged in and powered on.
Second, use the process of elimination to narrow in
on the problem. Third, swap out parts with known
good parts from your stash of FRUs. Swapping out
bad hardware for good hardware almost
immediately yields results. The exception to this
rule is the power supply, which should be road
tested for half a day or longer.
■
Complete the troubleshooting process by testing
the results of your actions and running the PC
through its paces. If the problem persists, call a
senior tech for help. Your notes should get a senior
tech up to speed on the problem. Finally, document
your results.

PC industry. The physical organization of the
components on the motherboard is called the AT
form factor.
ATA (AT attachment)
A type of hard drive and
controller. ATA was designed to replace the earlier

most modern CPUs have a special backside bus. Some
buses, such as that in the later Celeron processors
(300A and beyond), run at the full speed of the CPU,
whereas others run at a fraction. Earlier Pentium IIs,
for example, had backside buses running at half the
speed of the processor. See also frontside bus and EDB

Backup or Restore Wizard
A utility contained within
Windows that allows a user to create system backups
and set system restore points.
Bandwidth
A piece of the spectrum occupied by
some form of signal, such as television, voice, fax
data, etc. Signals require a certain size and location of
bandwidth in order to be transmitted. The higher the
bandwidth, the faster the signal transmission,
allowing for a more complex signal such as audio or
video. Because bandwidth is a limited space, when
one user is occupying it, others must wait their turn.
Bandwidth is also the capacity of a network to
transmit a given amount of data during a given
period.

performance when all elements are known to be
working properly.
Basic disks
A hard drive partitioned in the “classic”
way with a master boot record (MBR) and partition
table. See also dynamic disks.

Baud
One analog cycle on a telephone line. In the
early days of telephone data transmission, the baud
rate was often analogous to bits per second. Due to
advanced modulation of baud cycles as well as data
compression, this is no longer true.
Beep codes
A series of audible tones produced by a
motherboard during the POST. These tones identify
whether the POST has completed successfully or
whether some piece of system hardware is not working
properly. Consult the manual for your particular
motherboard for a specific list of beep codes.
Binary numbers
A number system with a base of 2,
unlike the number systems most of us use which have
bases of 10 (decimal numbers), 12 (measurement in
feet and inches), and 60 (time). Binary numbers are
preferred for computers for precision and economy.
An electronic circuit that can detect the difference
between two states (on–off, 0–1) is easier and more
inexpensive to build than one that could detect the
differences among ten states (0–9).
Biometric device
Hardware device used to support
authentication, which works by scanning and
remembering unique aspects of a user’s various body
parts (e.g., retina, iris, face, or fingerprint) using some
form of sensing device such as a retinal scanner.
BIOS (basic input/output system)
Classically, the
software routines burned onto the system ROM of a
PC. More commonly seen as any software that

50 GB of data, designed to be the replacement media
for DVD. Competes with HD DVD.
Boot
To initiate an automatic routine that clears the
memory, loads the operating system, and prepares the
computer for use. The term is derived from “pull
yourself up by your bootstraps.” PCs must do that
because RAM doesn’t retain program instructions
when power is turned off. A cold boot occurs when the
PC is physically switched on. A warm boot loads a fresh
OS without turning off the computer, lessening the
strain on the electronic circuitry. To do a warm boot,
press the CTRL-ALT-DELETE keys at the same time
twice in rapid succession (the three-fingered salute).
Boot sector
The first sector on a PC hard drive or
floppy disk, track 0. The boot-up software in ROM
tells the computer to load whatever program is found
there. If a system disk is read, the program in the boot
record directs the computer to the root directory to
load the operating system.
BOOT.INI
A text file used during the boot process
that provides a list of all OSs currently installed and
available for NTLDR. Also tells where each OS is
located on the system.
Bootable disk
A disk that contains a functional
operating system; can also be a floppy disk or CD-ROM.
BOOTLOG.TXT
A text file where information
concerning the boot process is logged; useful when
troubleshooting system boot errors and problems.
Bootstrap loader
A segment of code in a system’s
BIOS that scans for an operating system, looks
specifically for a valid boot sector, and, when one is
found, hands control over to the boot sector; then the
bootstrap loader removes itself from memory.
bps (bits per second)
Measurement of how fast data
is moved from one place to another. A 56K modem
can move 56,000 bits per second.
Bridge
A device that connects two networks and
passes traffic between them based only on the node
address, so that traffic between nodes on one network
does not appear on the other network. For example,
an Ethernet bridge only looks at the Ethernet address.
Bridges filter and forward packets based on MAC
addresses and operate at Level 2 (Data Link layer) of
the OSI seven-layer model.
Broadband
A type of signaling that sends multiple
signals (channels) over the cable at the same time. The
best example of broadband signaling is cable television.
The zero, one, and idle states (see baseband) exist on
multiple channels on the same cable. Also, broadband
refers to high-speed, always-on communication links
such as cable modems and DSL.
