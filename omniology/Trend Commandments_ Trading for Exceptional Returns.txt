Praise for 
Trend Commandments
“Fire up the barbecue. Michael Covel skewers the sacred cows of Wall Street with
tasty bite-sized bits of the truth about what it really takes to succeed in trading
and life. Wide-ranging, irreverent, revealing, eminently quotable, and right on
the money.”
—Charles Faulkner, Market Wizard Trading Coach
“A rapidly moving, non-technical, and outside-the-box effort that smartly
captures the essentials of trend following.”
—Peter Borish, Chairman and CEO, Computer Trading Corp
“Covel’s Trend Commandments offers a breezy rumination on what is right
about trend following and what is wrong about conventional trading
approaches.”
—Jack Schwager, Author of Market Wizards and Schwager on Futures series
“Michael Covel’s Trend Commandments is full of practical wisdom in bite-size
portions on the benefits of trend trading—written in a straightforward
storytelling format. It’s definitely one to add to your financial bookshelf.”
—David Stendahl, Signal Financial Group
“Michael Covel is the very best at explaining the concepts of successful trend
following in plain English. I’m certain you’ll be a successful trader if you follow
the ideas he outlines in Trend Commandments. This book (and his previous
two!) are required reading for new employees in my office.”
—Steve Sjuggerud, DailyWealth
“An outstanding book for anyone who wants to become rich by trading markets.
Today, government regulations and fiscal and monetary policies are badly
distorting financial markets. Covel accurately explains why, in this ‘manipulated’
financial environment, you should never expect markets to move as you wish or
expect. Rather, disregard your fundamental beliefs and simply follow the trend.
Highly recommended!”
—Marc Faber, Managing Director, Marc Faber Ltd., 
and Editor, “Gloom Boom & Doom Report”
“Investors have experienced two bear markets in the last decade. This has led to
rising volatility, uncertainty, and investor angst. For some it has been a lost
decade, but for trend traders it has been a decade of opportunity. Trend
Commandments helps you focus on what matters most: the trend of the markets,
whether up or down. You can profit from either. Trend Commandments is
essential reading for those who have the desire to thrive and survive in an era of
fast-paced trending markets.”
—Jim Puplava, CEO, Chief Investment Strategist, PFS Group

“Buy and hold has been a difficult investment system for investors for a decade.
In Trend Commandments, Covel challenges readers to think differently and
question their beliefs about market ‘truths’ ingrained in them for years.
Forewarned, you just may never see the world the same way again.”
—Mebane Faber, Cambria Investment Management
“If you are even thinking of a career in trading, put down all the other books.
Buy this one. Read it. Now you can start your career.”
—James Altucher, Managing Director, Formula Capital

This is your last chance.
After this, there is no 
turning back. You take the 
blue pill—the story ends,
you wake up in your 
bed and believe whatever 
you want to believe.
You take the red pill—
you stay in Wonderland

Do not strive for things 
occurring to occur 
as you wish,
but wish the things 
occurring as they occur,
and you will flow well.1

Ignition
Trading for exceptional returns may not appear realistic in the schizophrenic
cacophony:
“What is the right approach for investors faced with an unusually uncertain
economic outlook and volatile markets?”
“Big concerns over job insecurity, consumer and corporate spending, and
housing prices.”
“Should you buy gold?”
“Where are markets headed?”
“Oil shock, dollar drop, Japanese earthquake, elections!”
That’s white noise.
Yes, sure, of course, you may have more options, but an explosion of
naiveté has muddied the waters. Ignorance and confusion reign supreme.
The idiot box is no longer just the bedroom flat screen. It is every PC, Mac,
iPhone, and iPad. People absorb TMZ and Drudge via an intravenous drip.
We are in a voyeuristic world where living vicariously through someone or
something is accepted without hesitation and, in fact, encouraged.
With brain synapses bombarded nonstop, it is no surprise that this has
brought attention spans down to just a few seconds—about the same as a
goldfish. However, an incessant barrage of information across every known
connected device will not punch your ticket to financial freedom.
Retirement plans that have elderly dining on cat food, buying gold
because you are scared, canning food, and setting up a crisis garden are not
solutions. If that’s your direction, this book is a tough love punch to your
gut. Brutal honesty about what it
takes to get ahead with your
money is coming in these pages
like a hard rain. There is no reason
to continue on the hamster wheel.
You simply need a winning
philosophy and strategy, backed by
proven positive results that you can
execute. Push the pause button.
You don’t have to be a 
hamster running through a
Habitrail®. “Despite all my rage 
I am still just a rat in a cage” 
is not fait accompli.2

In the film Contact, Jodie Foster plays a character called Ellie, a scientist
who cannot figure out an alien signal from the deep reaches of outer space
until she finds the key—the “primer.” Finally she receives help from a Carl
Sagan-like benefactor named S. R. Hadden:
Hadden: The powers that be have been very busy lately, falling over
each other to position themselves for the game of the millennium to
decipher the alien signal. Maybe I can help deal you back in.
Ellie: I didn’t realize that I was out.
Hadden: Oh, maybe not out, but certainly being handed your hat. I
have had a long time to make enemies Doctor…and I wish to make a
small contribution. A final gesture of goodwill to the people of this
planet….
Ellie: You’ve found the primer!
Hadden: Clever girl.
Today, John W. Henry is the owner of the Boston Red Sox baseball team.
He also now owns the famed Liverpool Football Club in Britain. Red Sox
price: $700 million. Liverpool: $476 million. He is not broke.
How did he make that fortune?
Trading in a very rigid, rules-defined, way.
In 1995, Henry, a former farmer from Arkansas who began his trading
career humbly hedging his crops, made speculative trading history. His trad-
ing strategies essentially won the money lost by rogue trader Nick Leeson of
Barings Bank (often referred to as the “Queen’s bank”). Leeson bet wildly
and lost $1.3 billion. The Queen’s bank collapsed. Leeson was the Time
cover boy. Media ate up the bank’s implosion and coverage was nonstop.
Leeson was the known loser. Henry was the then-unknown winner.
Henry won practicing a form of trading called systematic trend following.
His big win was never revealed (see my first book, Trend Following). Some
tight insiders knew, but with detective-like probing, I outed Henry’s win.
Just like S. R. Hadden, the primer to Henry’s moneymaking system was
deep in my mind and gut.
But money success is much more than some event in the long ago dot-
com era. It is about an ongoing profit system that reaps spoils when markets
crash and fear cascades—as in 2008. It’s also about finding big trends to ride
even when there is no panic or crisis. Trend following, however, is not theo-
retical or academic wonk talk. There are decades of substantial performance
proof.

Big money making starts with trends, or waves. Anyone who makes sig-
nificant money rides waves. And guess what? No one can predict the next big
one. The only certainty is that when the big wave comes, trend followers will
surf the new beaches.
That simple-sounding ideology is instrumental for financial flexibility, as
trend followers trade that same philosophy in all markets. You can storm into
any moving market, be it an obscure currency or a stock in wild emerging
markets. Trend following is agnostic to both the market and direction. It is
a James Bond “007 license” to pursue whatever market is flowing up or
down.
Now, nearly 20 years after outsmarting the Queen’s bank, John W.
Henry and his trend trading peers still operate in an essentially secretive
underground society, a financial parallel world. Henry’s accomplishments are
astounding, but many of his trend-trading peers have also killed it. Traders
such as David Harding, Ken Tropin, Louis Bacon, and Bruce Kovner have
become billionaires trading unpredictable trends.
Additionally, mysterious firms not built around individual names, are also
making trend-chasing fortunes. Sunrise Capital, Transtrend, BlueCrest, Altis
Partners, Aspect Capital, and Man Investments just to name a few, are some
of today’s top traders, pulling billions in profits out of the markets—quietly
and effectively. While seemingly everyone else is mainlined into the matrix for
a daily fix of mutual funds, news, and government, trend traders keep on keep-
ing on. But this is not about hero worship; it’s about learning from winners.
John W. Henry was recently asked how he did that—meaning make the
money. He quipped, “I didn’t do that. Mathematical formulas did that. It’s
made through trend following.” The interviewer noted that the U.S. dollar
was down and asked if he bet against it. Henry replied with a smile, “Right,
very good.” The interviewer said, “I don’t get that.” Henry with a touch of
sarcasm added, “Neither will your readers.”3
If you are thinking that I have inserted a conspiracy theory, X-Files, or
Area 51 edge to trend following, smart thinking. Trend traders are dialed in
and average investors are lost? Indeed. Many investors today hide their
money under mattresses. Everything that used to be safe is now risky.
Real estate has cratered. Stocks are up one day, and down the next. Buy
and hope with no S&P 500 Index returns for a decade. Dot-com bubble?
Check, that disaster never left. Politicians on both sides of the aisle are just
fear mongers. And let’s not forget about salesmen hawking gold as a hedge
against the end times.
Don’t fret! There is good news. This book is real hope. It is the primer
that unlocks the path of trend trading.

Trend Commandments

Trend Commandments is a new inspirational vantage. It is not my prior
books. The tone is different. The style is different. Its objective is to be more
accessible and rooted in principles over person-
alities. I thought a different approach to get this
story out was required, for very few are yet
aware of what’s in these pages.
Sadly, many still see making money wrong.
They make wildly inaccurate assumptions about
what constitutes a winning trader:
• Do they possess a unique talent?
• A special inborn gene or divine gift?
• The innate talent of a child prodigy?
• Inside knowledge?
• Ability to predict markets?
• Degrees in finance or an MBA?
• Huge starting capital?
One answer: No.
Why do we not know that? Instant gratification is our Achilles’ heel.
Multitask this and that. Kardashians. Now. Faster. Easier. Patience is a four-
letter word.
How does the latest iPad help you to make money trading the markets?
How does attending a Code Pink or Tea Party rally help? How does con-
nected 24/7 help you? TweetDeck, favorite blog, fancy broker tools…all will
do what? How does electing your favorite politi-
cian help you to make money? How would
changing the government in Egypt, Libya, or the
United States for that matter make your retire-
ment easier?
Let’s be honest. It’s all about you. It’s you,
your friends, and your family against the world.
This book is for people who want above and beyond an average. It’s about
getting wealthy and thriving. Now, faster, and easier doesn’t work for market
prosperity. That’s not strategy. Trend following traders don’t play that way,
and neither should you.
Ten years ago, Jason Fried of 37signals.com was hired as my first pro web
site designer. He has since moved on to ventures far exceeding simple web
site design, so it was very random that his book Rework inspired me to write
Trend Commandments. His big question made me think:
If you are not 
criticized, you might
not be doing much.
Tomorrow is always
another day in the
dream factory.

“Taking a stand always stands out. Who do you want to take a shot at?”4
A valid question. My answer: Wall Street, the government, and media for
starters.
Let go of them.
That is a breath of fresh air in an era of constant depression and recession
talk, nonstop predictions, clueless economists, and Federal Reserve Ponzi
schemes. Trend Commandments is for those who know deep down that there
is a real way to make money in the markets, but just do not know how yet.
However, you will be surprised that the secret is hiding in plain sight.
There was a great story on author Seth Godin’s web site. He had a col-
lege professor who worked as an engineering consultant. There was a 40-
story office tower in Boston with a serious problem—an unsightly dark
smudge was coming through the drywall. The multimillion-dollar fix would
be to rip out all the drywall. Godin’s former professor was hired in a last-
ditch effort. He said, “I think I can fix it, but it will cost you $45,000.” The
owners instantly agreed. The professor wrote down the name of a common
hardware store chemical. “Here,” he said and sent a $45,000 bill. It was a
bargain.5
The words condensed into Trend Commandments were gleaned from my
15 years of behind-the-scenes learning at the feet of great trend following
traders. It was a one-of-a-kind educational journey. My books Trend
Following
and
The Complete
TurtleTrader have sold more than
100,000 copies (no bragging, just
for reference). My documentary
film Broke outlined the Great
Recession from a trend following
perspective. That took three years
and 100,000 travel miles alone.
You might argue against my
words, but arguing against my
passion and research will be exhausting. Trust me, but verify every word
herein. Accept nothing without questioning why. Find holes in the argu-
ments, and when you can’t, send me a thank you card.
You want confidence and inspiration? It’s here. 
Note: There are not only 10 trend commandments. There are dozens of perspectives, com-
parisons, critiques, rules, and examples herein. And don’t feel compelled to read linearly; start
anywhere. Also, be careful that you don’t singularly fixate on trading rules alone (read:
entry/exit). If you exclude the discipline, psychology, and perseverance, etc., needed to excel
in the long run, you won’t make it.
Trend following starts with
knowing when to do nothing.
The market is screaming like a
spoiled brat? Step to the side.
That’s your first play.

If you must play, decide upon
three things at the start: 
the rules of the game,
the stakes,
and quitting time.1

Expectations
Who will Trend Commandments reach?
This book is for those kindred spirits who grasp there is no secret to trad-
ing but rather just knowledge you have not yet discovered. It is for anyone
who wants to make the most money possible—without going broke or going
overboard on risk.
It is for investors and traders
small and large, young and old,
female and male—worldwide.
Trend Commandments is also for
anyone fascinated by how great
trend traders think and act to make
a fortune. If you have other rea-
sons for reading this book, that is
fine too.
My words are not a set of magic rules for becoming a wealthy trend fol-
lowing trader with no work on your end. To achieve the pot of gold, you will
need more than that. However, to explain all the details you will need, you
must know what you are up against.
The well-constructed fortress
of government, media, and Wall
Street, all designed to bleed you
dry, is “The Wall” (think Roger
Waters). None of those players
want you to comprehend or act
on the contents of this book. If
you do get it, those groups lose
power and money. They do not
want to lose anything. Their grip
on you is stranglehold tight.
Getting rich is a fight; make
no mistake about it.
Panics do not destroy capital—
they merely reveal the extent to
which it has previously been
destroyed by its betrayal in
hopelessly unproductive works.2
There cannot be a 
suggestion that the attempt 
of describing, explaining, 
predicting, and controlling is
wrong, no matter how foolish
it may appear. Let men be 
fools because that is part of
their nature.3

Henry Ford: “If I’d 
asked my customers 
what they wanted, 
they would have said 
a faster horse.”1

Jargon
To avoid confusion throughout Trend Commandments, a few of Wall Street’s
favorite catch phrases need to be defined. I am defining these because Wall
Street suits use them to sell. Do not let the jargon engulf you. 
CTA: CTA stands for commodity trading advisor. It is a government
term used to classify regulated fund managers who primarily trade futures
markets. Almost all successful CTAs trade as trend following traders. CTAs
are the other quants the media never seems to cover accurately.
Managed Futures: This is a term that describes regulated fund managers
who use futures to trade for clients. It is an awful term because it fixates on
the instrument (futures), not the strategy. Here’s the dirty little secret:
Almost all successful managed futures trading firms use a trend following
strategy. The term is often used interchangeably with CTA. Noted radio host
and author Dave Ramsey recently had this to say about managed futures: 
“The term managed futures is virtually an oxymoron…with managed
futures you’re basically betting on the future price of a commodity.
What’s the price of gold, or oil, or wheat going to be somewhere
down the road? You’re guessing as to what the future will bring, and
managing a group of those guesses. What a joke!”2
If after reading Trend Commandments you share Dave Ramsey’s view and
understanding, I recommend a full frontal lobotomy as your best wealth-
building plan.
High Frequency Trading:
High frequency trading is the
latest term to describe arbitrage—
at whatever time frame. It is about
getting an advantage through
speed and access. Most people are
not going to enter the world of
high frequency trading (or be
Goldman Sachs). It’s a nonissue
for your trading success.
Whenever there is market 
movement, it is necessary for a
Wall Street analyst to feel 
that he or she knows 
why it occurred. 
Almost always what they 
say is worthless.

Trend Commandments

Global Macro or Systematic Global Macro: Global macro is another
term used to describe trend following traders, but indirectly. They do not say
managed futures, and they do not say hedge fund, so it is global macro. It
might make wealthy investors in Liechtenstein and Saudi Arabia feel more
secure. The strategy is still trend following.
Hedge Fund: Think unregulated mutual fund that can trade in all mar-
kets up and down. Most hedge funds have terrible strategy: They are long
only on leveraged stocks. That’s it. Not as sexy as the press makes it. Of
course, it all depends, and some hedge funds do make a killing. Usually, they
are of the systematic trend following variety.
Long Only: Long only means you make one bet. You bet that the 
market will always go up.
Buy and Hold: Buy and hold (hope) is the same as long only.
Index Investing: You buy the S&P 500 Index and whatever it does is
the return you get.
Value Investing: Attempts to use fundamentals to uncover undervalued
stocks. The belief is you are buying cheap or low (terms that can mean any-
thing to anyone). When that doesn’t work out, you call the government and
ask for a bailout.
Quant: You use formulas and rules, not daily discretion or fundamentals
to make trading decisions. That said, unless quant is defined with precision
you can never know what it means exactly. Trend following is a form of quant
trading.
Repeatable Alpha: Alpha is return generated from trading skill. If you
buy and hold the S&P 500 Index, and if it makes a positive return, that’s not
alpha. That return is beta for there was no skill involved. Repeatable alpha is
simply the nice academic way of saying profit from skill. Trend following’s
argument as the only repeatable alpha is tough to counter.
Beta: The return you get for accepting the average. There is no skill
involved. Think about a monkey aimlessly throwing darts against the wall—
it’s that level of skill.
Long: You buy a stock or futures contract.
Short (verb): The ability to profit from a decline in price of a stock or
futures contract.

S&P 500: Is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large cap U.S.
equities. The index was first published in 1957 and includes 500 leading
companies.
Moving Average: A moving
average series can be calculated for
any time series, but is most often
applied to market prices. Moving
averages are used to smooth out
short-term 
fluctuations, 
thus
highlighting potentially longer-
term trends.
Average True Range: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_True_

A Vulcan mind-meld allows

There’s no earthly way of knowing,
Which direction we are going,
There’s no knowing where we’re rowing,
Or which way the rivers flowing,
Is it raining?
Is it snowing?
Is a hurricane a-blowing?
Not a speck of light is showing,
So the danger must be growing,
Are the fires of hell a-glowing?
Is the grisly reaper mowing?
Yes, the danger must be growing,
Cause the rowers keep on rowing,
And they’re certainly not showing,
Any signs that they are slowing!1

Show Me the Money
Some say, “There’s no romance in trend following.” It’s a matter of perspec-
tive. The romance is found in returns. Money…the ultimate aphrodisiac.
Performance data examples that follow could be the foundation of every
college finance class. When you show up on the first day, instead of your
teacher handing you a syllabus and telling you to buy certain books, you are
handed one piece of paper that simply shows the performance histories of
professional trend following traders for the last 50 years.
The entire semester could be built around that study alone. But first, to
judge systematic trend following performance, you need a baseline. The S&P
500 is the barometer for making money in the markets. Comparing to it is
wholly appropriate (even though some might carp).
Who are some of the top-performing trend following traders over the last
30 years? How much have they made? Consider the wealth generation:
• Bruce Kovner is worth more than $4.1 billion.2
• John W. Henry is worth $840 million.3
• Bill Dunn made $80 million in 2008.4
• Michael Marcus turned an initial $30,000 into $80 million.5
• David Harding is now worth more than $690 million.6
• Ed Seykota turned $5,000 into $15 million over 12 years.7
• Kenneth Tropin made $120 million in 2008.8
• Larry Hite has made millions upon millions over 30 years.9
• Louis Bacon is worth $1.7 billion.10
• Paul Tudor Jones is worth $3 billion.11
• Transtrend, a trend-trading fund, has produced hundreds of millions, if
not billions, in profit.
• Trend following trader Man Group trades $68.6 billion in assets.12
From January 1980 to December 2008, the Barclays CTA Index
achieved a 2805 percent return, or a 12.2 percent compounded average
annual return. The Barclay CTA Index is a representative performance index
of trend traders. For 2010, there were 533 traders included in the index.

Some miss the point:
“You are just touting super suc-
cessful traders. What does that have
to do with me?”
These names are featured for
one reason: Proof.
Their returns are a precise illus-
tration of what can be earned via
trend following trading. Consider
this nearly 40-year track record of

Paul Mulvaney (Mulvaney
Capital) is a trend following trader
too. Here are his last five years of
trend following performance:
2010: +34.90%
2009: –5.89%
2008: +108.87%
2007: –23.14%
2006: +21.94%16
Big numbers like those cause some irrational agitation. One person wrote
me: “I am sorry but that performance is nothing amazing. I would say it’s
ok, but not great.”
Don’t hate, congratulate! That critic’s thinking is not very bright.
Passive aggressive you could say.
Better yet, consider compounding some of these numbers. For example,
if you could make 50 percent a year, you could compound an initial $20,000
account to more than $616,000 in just seven years. Is 50 percent unrealistic?
Of course it is. However, do the math again using 25 percent.
Think about this: Since October 1997, one
trend following trader has produced annualized
returns higher than 21 percent. To put that in
context, if you bought Vincent van Gogh’s Irises
in 1947, you paid $80,000. The next time it
changed hands, in 1987, it was sold for $53.9
million. That seems like a huge increase in value,

the big returns.

but mathematically it shows a compound average annual growth rate of 17.7
percent, which is less than the annualized returns of my example trend
trader.18
One of the first Wall Street books I ever read was Jim Rogers’ Investment
Biker. Rogers brought much passion and common sense to the table. Nearly
14 years later, in early 2008, my travels took me to see him at his home in
Singapore for my documentary film. Rogers, who is not a technical trend fol-
lowing trader, but who has made a fortune trading trends, put the impor-
tance of compounding at the top of his list:
“One of the biggest mistakes most
investors make is believing that they’ve
always got to be doing something. The
trick to investing is not to lose money.
The losses will kill you. They ruin your
compounding rate; and compounding is
the magic of investing.”19
Why is trend following money making not common knowledge for so
many? The journey to find that answer is not a straight line.
You can perform 
yourself out of 
business.

Hello? Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me. 
Is there anyone at home?1

Blowing Bubbles
“People are shortsighted, overconfident in so-called predictive skills, and
irrationally prone to buying insurance on cheap home appliances. In short,
they exhibit tendencies not unlike your not so swift brother-in-law.”
“The human brain responds to high-stakes trading just as it does to the lure
of sex. And the riskier trades get, the more the brain craves them.”
“Social conformity drives human beings. Even if the group is wrong, people
go along.”
Sounds about right, right?
Consider the question: Does raw
human emotion dictate financial
decisions, or are we rational calcu-
lators of our self-interest?
The idea that we behave irra-
tionally when it comes to money
may not seem radical, but it chal-
lenges the dominant University of
Chicago economic philosophy that has framed business and government for
fifty years. Their campus has given rise to more Nobel Prize winners in eco-
nomics than any other institution. Nearly all share the common assumption:
When it comes to money, we are highly rational.3
One of the foremost champions of that view is Gary Becker: “The most
powerful theory we have, and I think it’s the most powerful theory in the
social sciences, is economics as a theory of rational behavior at an individual
level, and that’s the theory we rely on.”4
Other academics are not on board for obvious
reasons: “The 2008 crash really matters because
much of the behavior that led up to the crash is
unexplained by the discipline of economics.”5
More Chicago academics ignore the 2008
crash: “I’m sorry, that’s such an empty argument. That’s just an insult, a
pointless insult.”6 Eugene Fama, the father of so-called efficient markets,
smirked: “I don’t see this as a failure of economics, but we need a whipping
boy, and economists have always been whipping boys, so they’re used to it.
It’s fine.”7
At the peak of tulip mania in
Holland, in February 1637, single
tulip bulbs sold for more than 
10 times the annual income of 
a skilled craftsman.2
Beware of

Those economists defend their view no matter what. People and markets
are rational? Small children now know that is not true. However, university
professors have convinced themselves human beings only use robotlike logic.
On the other hand, Jeremy Grantham has made money for 40 years by
finding price bubbles and betting against them: “We’ve found 27 bubbles.
It’s euphoria causing the price to go up and realism causing it to fall back,
and then, eventually, unrealistic panic, as it begins to feed on itself, and the
lemmings head in the opposite direction.”8
One academic does see it like Grantham. Nobel Prize winner Vernon
Smith devised an experimental market in which investors could create a finan-
cial “bubble.” Far from learning from their experience after creating a bub-
ble, investors would go on to create yet another bubble. This time, the
bubble occurred earlier than the prior experiment and was not as pronounced
as the first. When investors were asked why they allowed themselves to cre-
ate a second bubble, the most common response was they thought they
could get out before the top this time. Smith’s research showed that the only
reliable method of removing bubbles is to use players who are experienced
twice over. We apparently only learn after two blowups!9
Give Rod Serling credit for figuring it all out back in 1960, and give him
more credit for burying it so illusively in an episode of The Twilight Zone:
Alien visitor #1: Understand the procedure now? Just stop a few of
their machines and radios and telephones and lawn mowers…throw
them into darkness for a few hours, and then just sit back and watch
the pattern.
Alien visitor #2: And this pattern is always the same?
Alien visitor #1: With few varia-
tions. They pick the most danger-
ous enemy they can find and
it’s…themselves. All we need to
do is sit back…and watch.10

dation of trend following profit.

The mother of all evil 
is speculation.1
The most valuable 
commodity I know of 
is information,
wouldn’t you agree?2
Note: Those two quotes are from film director Oliver Stone.

Speculari
The film director Oliver Stone believes that speculation is evil. That’s inter-
esting. He has written some fantastic scripts. He has directed Oscar-winning
films. Nevertheless, to say that speculation is “the mother of all evil” is disin-
genuous. When Stone sets forward to make a new film, he’s speculating that
you will spend your money and watch his film.
There is nothing wrong with that. That’s life.
That’s a good thing.
Speculation in markets is essential too. Think
about what drives a market. It is millions of 
people speculating to make money. One of the
most successful trend following traders knows deep
down how important speculation is to finding
opportunity:
“Speculari, the Latin root of the verb “to speculate” has the literal
meaning to observe. To be successful this observation must, of neces-
sity, be detached and unemotive and thus where great social and moral
issues are at stake, it is perhaps not surprising that distrust and hostil-
ity among the general population can arise particularly when the spec-
ulator profits at a time of general discontent. Yet this detached
observation is clearly in the spirit of the natural scientist and the act of
speculating for money is in the spirit of the empirical scientist’s restless
yearning to add to empirical knowledge and put theories to the test.”3
Regardless of whether you win or lose, you are speculating—trying to get
ahead. Every time you get into a car, you are speculating. If you go to the
Apple store to buy an iPhone you are speculating the phone is more valuable
than your dollars. Additionally, you are speculating the iPhone will work.
When you turn on a show you are speculating that it is worth more than
something else. All of these activities don’t always work out, and that is the
nature of speculation. All speculators are not winners.4
So why is it bad to take advantage of an opportunity that you recognize?
It’s not. 
Speculate this: Do you consider yourself an investor or a trader? Investors
put their money into investments hoping value will increase over time.
Typically, they have no plan if it goes down. They usually hold on, praying
value will reverse and go back up. Investors typically succeed in bull markets
and lose in bear markets. They usually have no coherent response when the
losing starts. They often hang tight and continue to lose even more.
Why did the 
market fall? 
There was more
selling than buying. 

Trend Commandments

Traders are different. They have a defined
strategy to put money to work for a single goal:
profit. Wise trend traders do not care what they
buy or sell as long as they end up with more
money in the long run. Bottom line, winning
traders don’t invest, they trade. It is a massive 
distinction.
Consider timeless qualities essential to speculation:
1. Self-reliance: A man must think for himself and must follow his own
convictions. Self-trust is the foundation of successful effort.
2. Judgment: That equipoise, that nice adjustment of the faculties of 
one to the other, which is called good judgment—essential to the 
speculator.
3. Courage: That is, confidence to act on the decisions of the mind. In
speculation, there is value in the dictum: Be bold, still be bold; always
be bold.
4. Prudence: The power of measuring the danger, together with a certain
alertness and watchfulness, is very important. There should be a 
balance of prudence and courage; prudence in contemplation, courage
in execution.
5.
Pliability: The ability to
change an opinion, the
power of revision. He who
observes and observes again
is always formidable.5
I don’t care whether you ever
trade, but those precepts should
be the first life lessons taught to
grade school kids.
The law of gravity: 
What goes up
must also 
come down.
Recent college graduates have
structured their lives around
speculation that a high-paying
job awaits following graduation.
That’s not very smart 
speculation.6

My own view is that this planet is
used as a penal colony, lunatic asylum,
and dumping ground by a superior 
civilization, to get rid of the undesirable
and unfit. I can’t prove it, but you
can’t disprove it either. It happens to
be my view, but it doesn’t challenge any
of the findings of Darwin or Huxley
or Einstein or Hawking.1

Fundamentals Are Religion
There are two basic market theories. The fundamentalist studies economic
realities—supply and demand factors—that they believe underlie market val-
ues. Fundamental analysis relies on government policy, economic projections,
price-earnings ratios, and balance sheet analysis (and so on) to make buy and
sell decisions. The religion of fundamental analysis is about telling stories:
• Crude oil traded near an eight-week low because of concern fuel
demand will be curbed amid signs of slowing economic growth in the
U.S. and the U.K.
• History suggests the time is right to buy Dow stocks.
• It’s not too late to profit from rally as market’s cycle shifts in favor of
blue-chip stocks.
• They’re cheap by recent historical standards.
• The index’s trailing price to earnings ratio, a measure that shows
investors how much they are paying for a dollar in earnings, is well
below what it has averaged.
• The price to earnings ratio for the S&P 500.
• Commodities look to be more expensive in the coming sessions and
coming weeks to months.
• Has the metals correction run its course?
• My gut tells me the indices are overdue for a setback but the jury is still
out.
• Secular decline over the last four cycles.
• We feel an interim top is in.
• Decline in nominal GDP.
• Based on supply and demand constraints, corn and soybeans need to
trade higher to ration demand and to find more acreage.
• Initial unemployment claims.
• Is this just a correction or could it turn into something more serious?
• Political and social unrest in the Middle East.

• Big miss in headline payrolls.
• Key driver of seasonal demand patterns in gold.
• A bullish USDA report aided in corn appreciation.
• Rising energy and materials shares, spurred by surging oil and gold
prices, have kept stocks in positive territory.
• The FOMC is meeting today and tomorrow so stay alert as even inac-
tion can be a market mover.
• EBITDA.
The fundamentals never stop.
So do you buy or sell oil now?
Exactly. Who knows how to really
trade with fundamentals? Very few,
if any, know how to use them.
This is not new. People have
told stories for centuries. It is an
activity that calms and soothes.
Think about religions. Many were created to satiate a desire for order.
Investors are no different. They want “cause and effect” explanations and feel
security in the illusion that there is a deeper understanding. It does not mat-
ter if the moneymaking strategy works or not. All that matters is the story.
Sheep go to slaughter much easier when they’re comforted and showered
with sweet nothings.
So how can the religion of fundamental analysis, taught on every college
campus and practiced at every mutual fund, generate repeatable alpha? It 
cannot.
Example. One famed financial
web site pointed to chocolate pud-
ding in their bio. When they were
young, they learned about stocks
from their father at the supermar-
ket. He would say, “See that pud-
ding? We own the company that
makes it. Every time someone buys that pudding, it’s good for our company.
So go get some more.”3
That story might be cute, but it is childlike ideology. Krispy Kreme makes
great donuts (no doubt), but it’s stock is around $6 years after reaching a
high of more than $40 a share. The “story” is irrelevant.
The system wins. Fundamentals
are nice, but useless in trading.
True fundamentals are 
always unknown.2
They said the market’s wrong.
It’ll come back. The market is
never wrong.

However, even the so-called educated don’t see clearly. A billion dollar
fund invited me to talk. They wanted to invest money into trend following
but were having a hard time accepting that it was not rooted in fundamen-
tals. They were comfortable with a trader who knew one market alone—fun-
damentally. They worshipped the idea that a trader could know everything
about some one market, which
would supposedly translate to
profit. They could not grasp trend
following.
It does not matter if you’re
trading 
stocks 
or 
soybeans.
Trading is trading, and the name
of the game is to make money, not
get an A in “How to Read a
Balance Sheet.”5
Technical analysis, the other
market theory, operates in stark contrast. It is based on the belief that at any
given point in time, market prices reflect all known fundamentals for that par-
ticular market. Instead of trying to evaluate fundamental factors, technical
analysis looks at market prices
themselves.
There are essentially two
forms of technical analysis. The
first is based on reading charts and
using indicators to supposedly
predict market direction. For
example, here is a mixing of fun-
damentals and predictive technical
analysis:
Grains all made subtle bull breakout technical moves last week as contin-
ued fear of a global grain panic builds premium into these markets. I do
believe that the grain rally should be sold into as it will be short-lived in
2011. The market is in the “what-if” stage of the winter season as they get
ready for plantings. What if China needs to import corn? What if
Australia’s wheat crop is gone? What if cotton acreage squeezes beans?
Well how about what if the market meets demand? I do not expect grain
prices to test 2008 levels—the fundamentals are not there yet and the hype
isn’t strong enough. Soybeans are a good spread play against corn, but
overall I would be a put buyer across the board. Rice is a sell into this short
covering rally with straight puts.
If a market is going up you 
go long; if it is going down, 
you go short. 
The only reason you take a 
trade is because the market is
doing something.4
The illusion has been 
created that there is an 
explanation for 
everything with the 
primary task to find that 
explanation.6

That is a view of technical analysis held by many. It’s worthless. Run
when you see that kind of talk.
Yet, there is another type of technical analysis that does not try to pre-
dict. Trend followers are the traders who use reactive technical analysis. They
react to market movements and follow along—without a story.

You can mix fundamental 
analysis with trend following.
You can mix it with astrology,
four-leaf clovers, 
chicken bones, lucky crickets,
and Aunt May’s arthritis cure. 
But why would you? 
Except to give the 
appearance that there’s 
a special sauce to

A prophet is not 
someone with special 
vision, just blind to 
what others see.1

Everything Flows
What is a trend? The question has hit me for over
a decade. You don’t spot trends. You don’t find
trends. You react to market movements, and
hopefully at the end of a big move, a big trend,
you will have made great money from that big
trend.
Consider an example to better make my point. A new trader asked: “I am
new to trend following and wish to ask you what your favorite chart is for
determining a given market’s trend? Daily, weekly, yearly, hourly?”
One old pro trend trader responded: “Your list lacks options for minute,
second, and millisecond. If you want to go for the really high-frequency stuff,
you might try trading visible light, in the range of one cycle per 10-15 sec-
onds. Trading gamma rays, at around one cycle per 10-20 seconds, requires
a lot of expensive instrumentation, whereas you can trade visible light by eye.
Higher-frequency trading succumbs to declining profit potential against non-
declining transaction costs. You might consider trading a chart with a long
enough time scale that transaction costs are a minor factor—something like
a daily price chart, going back a year or two.”2
All trends are historical. None are in the present. There is no way to
determine a current trend, or even define what current trend might mean.
You can only determine historical trends. And
the only way to measure a now trend, one
entirely in the moment of now, would be to take
two points, both in the now and compute their
difference. However, with that limitation in
mind, you can proceed to define, compute, and
use trends.3
That’s no philosophical word smithing. It is
critical that you let the distinctions sink in.
Watch chart lines…
not headlines.
Trends in motion
will stay in motion, 
they will persist,
until they reverse.4

You don’t need to know 
what will happen next 
in order to profit from 
whatever happens next.

Systematic Trend Following
What is trend following trading? The first part is trend. That is very straight-
forward. Every trader needs a trend to make money. Following is part two of
the phrase. Trend followers wait for a market to move first and then they fol-
low it.1
Now, some argue that the term trend following is too imprecise. Others
use terms like global statistical financial analysis or managed futures to
describe the strategy. That debate will not be solved here. If you do not like
the phrase trend following, substitute your term as you keep reading.
Trend following trading is
reactive. It does not predict mar-
ket direction. Trend trading
demands self-discipline to follow
precise rules (no guessing or wild
emotions). It involves a certain
risk management that uses the
current market price, equity level
in your account, and current mar-
ket volatility.
Trend traders use an initial risk rule to determine their trading size at
entry. That means you know exactly how much to buy or sell based on how
much money you have. Changes in price may lead to a gradual reduction or
increase of your initial trade. On the other hand, adverse price movements
will lead to an exit. A trend trader’s average profit per trade is significantly
higher than the average loss per trade.
Trend following aims to capture the middle, or the meat, of a market
trend, up or down, for profit. You will never get in at the absolute bottom or
get out at the absolute top. Stocks, ETFs, LEAPS options, bonds, currencies,
futures, and commodities are all ripe to trade.
This is the only trading strategy that can be traded on a desert island. As
long as price data is available, all else is inconsequential. Media, fundamen-
tals, broker opinions, talking heads, and so on are simply not necessary to
profit.
Yes, initial discretionary decisions must be made as a trend follower, such
as choosing a trend following system, selecting a portfolio, and determining

trading was best.

an appropriate amount to risk. However, after the basics have been set in
motion, you can systematize trend-trading rules and automate your daily
trading life. This is not day trading, where you are glued to the screen all day
in some Red Bull®–induced hyperactivity bender.
However, you have to main-
tain agnosticism to market direc-
tion for trend trading success.
Unfortun-ately, 
not 
everyone
comprehends or wants to compre-
hend that.
Consider Erin Burnett of
CNBC. She was interviewing
David Harding—a successful trend trader—and asked: “A lot of people obvi-
ously want to know what your secret is. What was the magic bullet?”
Harding replied: “The secret strangely enough is not having an idea of
what we are going to be doing in advance. We react to the unfolding mar-
kets trends rather than make fore-
casts of what’s going to happen.”
Burnett missed his point in
response: “When you look out
right now do you think, big pic-
ture, I know you are quantitative,
but do you believe that we are in a
fundamental cycle or are we in a
bubble?”
Harding: “It’s not false mod-
esty for me to say I don’t know. I
really don’t know. I really do not have the gift of second sight.”
Consider fundamental investor John Hussman. His writings are always
insightful. He makes a cogent case for an out of control Fed and Congress,
but consider an excerpt from his recent letter:
“In hindsight, I frankly underestimated the willingness of investors to
believe that the underlying structural difficulties of the economy
(which still persist in my view) were so easily
solved by disabling fair-market accounting dis-
closure and repeatedly violating the provisions of
the Federal Reserve Act. In any event, it is my
job to not only defend capital, but to achieve
returns despite the recklessness that policy mak-
ers choose to pursue.”5
Trend following works because
you don’t outthink it. 
You are a follower, 
not a predictor.3
The market is not the economy
and the market has no sympathy
for you, your family, or your 
emotions. It might not be fair, 
it might not be right, 
but it is what it is.4
Ride the horse 
in the direction 
it is going.6

Systematic Trend Following

Trend traders use an entirely different type of analysis not based on tra-
ditional reasoning. Trend followers do not have Hollywood narratives to
explain market bubbles on top of bubbles. A trend follower does not have to
know any of the things Hussman laments not knowing.
Buy things that have gone up 
on the theory that they will 
continue to go up; short things
that have gone down on the
theory that they will 
continue to go down.7

Empty your mind. Be formless,
shapeless, like water. Now you put
water into a cup, it becomes the
cup. You put water into a bottle it
becomes the bottle. You put it in a
teapot it becomes the teapot. 
Now water can flow or it can
crash. Be water, my friend.1

Change
Markets go up, down, and sideways. They trend. They flow. They surprise.
Have markets changed? Not only have markets changed, they will con-
tinue to change. Check your history books. If you have a valid market phi-
losophy, learning to accept that change and flow with it is your greatest asset.
No matter how ridiculous market moves appear at the beginning, and no
matter how extended or irrational they seem at the end, following trends is
the rational choice in a chaotic, changing world.2
That thinking leaves trend followers as gen-
eralists when it comes to their trading strategy
and that’s not easy to accept for many. The dom-
inant trend within universities is ever-narrower
specialization. A higher premium is placed on
deep knowledge within a single field (read: fun-
damental expertise in one market), versus broad
wisdom across multiple fronts.3
For example, one trend following practitioner started trading trends in
1974—making hundreds of millions in profits and perhaps billions for
clients. The major strategic elements of his trend following trading systems
have never changed. He was blunt: “The markets are just the markets. I know
that is unusual sounding.”4
Occasionally, someone trying to promote something or start a debate
will argue that trend following has to change due to changing market condi-
tions. Specious. The root of trend following is based on responding to
change. It is designed to be adaptable.
Does that mean every systematic trend trader
will take the risk of shooting only for huge
returns? No. Does that mean every trend trader
will capture a trend in the exact same way? No.
The trend following way has many practitioners
and many recipes. However, just as there are
thousands of car models, they are still cars.
Trend following
doesn’t argue with
markets.
The market will
fluctuate.5

Prediction is very
difficult, especially 
about the future.

No Prediction
“There are many, many things that Google could do, that we choose not to do.
One day we had a conversation where we figured we could just try to predict the
stock market. And then we decided it was illegal. So we stopped doing that.”1
Google is a great search engine. It won the title of search king, and for-
mer CEO Eric Schmidt has made a fortune. Congratulations. However,
when he opines like that, he sounds delusional.
Schmidt might be worth billions, but wealth does
not make up for a lack of common sense.
He is one of many.
A group of eminent economists recently apol-
ogized to Queen Elizabeth II for failing to predict
the financial crisis: “In summary, your majesty, the
failure to foresee the timing, extent and severity of the crisis and to head it
off, while it had many causes, was principally a failure of the collective imag-
ination of many bright people, both in this country and internationally, to
understand the risks to the system as a whole.”
What did the Queen think when she received that? Did she believe it?
Did she know better? No one can absolutely know when a market will move
and trend. Do you have to know to profit? No.
Look at insurance, gambling, and other related businesses. It is clear that
even a small positive edge, along with a solid view of probabilities, can lead to
fortunes. However, that does not mean the path to prosperity will necessar-
ily be comfortable.
Think about the emotional ups and downs when facing the unknown.
Leaving Las Vegas recently, I drove down toward Hoover Dam. Knowing I
would soon be from the vantage point of the new Hoover Dam bridge span-
ning the Colorado River, the feeling of anxiety was encompassing. During
the decline, you do not know how far you will be able to see down, but when
you finally get to the bridge, you can’t actually see the dam over the ledge!
The wall is too high. Relief.2
That is the life of a trend trader too: Keeping in check how you react to
the unexpected or unknowable. Many trend traders have even gone back and
looked at 19th century markets to see if their strategies would have been suc-
cessful. Interest rates, currencies, and grain prices in the 1800s showed just
as many trends. The markets were as random and unpredictable as today.3
Prices predict 
the future, 
not investors.

Similar research took me to the National Agricultural Library in
Beltsville, Maryland. My curiosity had me walking stacks reviewing 1800s
historical price data from the Economist magazine. I verified the same price
data research—indeed, unpredictable trends were across all markets.
Fast forward 100 years and consider a story about a trading seminar
where a notable trend follower was the guest
speaker. The audience peppered him with ques-
tions: “Do you like gold?” “Where do you think
the Canadian dollar is headed?” “How do you
know when there is a top?” To each of these, he
replied: “I like gold, its shiny, pretty, makes nice
jewelry” or “I have no idea where the Canadian
dollar is headed.” Many were not impressed. They
felt they had wasted their money. However, his message could not have
clearer. The answers were found in the very questions each person asked. Do
not ask, “How do you know the trend is moving up?” Instead, ask, “What is
going to tell me the trend is up?” Not, “What do you think of gold?” Instead,
ask, “Am I correctly trading gold?”4
His answers placed everyone in front of a mirror and worse yet, some did
not know it.
Long term trend
following is about 
survival.

It’s gettin’ so a businessman can’t
expect no return from a fixed fight.
Now, if you can’t trust a fix,
what can you trust? 
For a good return, you gotta go bettin’
on chance and then you’re back with
anarchy, right back in the jungle.1

Price Action
Tell me something the “market” does not know.
The idea that you can know enough about Apple, oil, GE, and gold to
trade them all the same way may seem preposterous, but think about what
they all have in common:
Price.
Market price is objective data.
You can look at individual price 
histories, without knowing which
market is which, and still trade 
all successfully. That is not what 
they teach at Harvard, Wharton,
Kellogg, Stern, Darden, or pick
your favorite business school du
jour.
However, the concept of price as the critical trading cue may be too sim-
ple for mass acceptance. For example, a prominent business anchor opined:
“At some point, investing is an act of faith. If you can’t believe the numbers,
annual reports, etc., what numbers can you believe?”
A longtime financial reporter at Fortune
magazine was also on the highway going the
wrong direction: “If some of the smartest people
on Wall Street can’t trust the numbers, you won-
der who can trust the numbers.”3
You can never trust those numbers—that is,
the reported firm details—completely. Someone
can always alter them (remember Enron had a fake trading floor). Beyond
that, even if you know accurate balance sheet numbers, how does this help
you determine when or how much to buy or sell?
The market is always right, and price is the only true reality in trading. If
you want to make money in any market, you need to mirror what the mar-
ket is doing. If the market is going down and you are long, the market is right
and you are wrong. If the market is going up and you are short, the market
is right and you are wrong. Other things being equal, the longer you stay
right with the market, the more money you will make. The longer you stay
wrong with the market, the more money you will lose.4
Don’t guess how far a 
trend will go. You cannot. 
Price makes the news, not the
other way around. 
A market is going to go where 
a market is going to go.2

You do not need to know anything about bonds. You do not need to
understand different currencies. They are just numbers. Corn is a little differ-
ent than bonds, but not different enough to
trade them differently. Some people have a differ-
ent system for each market. That is absurd. You
are trading mob psychology. You are not trading
corn, soybeans, or S&P’s. You are merely trading
numbers.5
Price is fact; 
all else conjecture.

No risk, no reward.

Place Your Bet
You want to see life as a continuum running on a loop back and forth from
risk to reward. If you want a big reward, take a big risk. If you want an aver-
age reward and an average life, take an average risk. Easier said than done,
however, if you want the big reward. Our system is notorious for playing
Whac-A-Mole with achievers.
From an early age, people are
conditioned by families, schools,
and virtually every other shaping
force in society to avoid risk. To
take risks is inadvisable; to play it
safe is the message. Risk can only
be bad. However, winners under-
stand risk is highly productive,
and not something to avoid. Taking calculated risks is different from acting
rashly. Playing it safe is the true danger. Far more often than you might real-
ize, the real risk in life turns out to be the refusal to take a risk.2
If life is a game of risk, then to one degree or another, being comfortable
with assessing odds is the only option for a fulfilling life.
Consider trading from a “startup” business
perspective. Every business is ultimately involved
in assessing risk. Putting capital to work to make
it grow is the goal. In that sense, all business is
the same. The right decisions lead to success, and
wrong ones lead to insolvency.
Blunt, but true.
There are ways to go in the right direction, however. Ask yourself these
questions:
• What is the market opportunity in the market niche?
• What is your solution to the market need?
• How big is the opportunity?
• How do you make money?
• How do you reach the market and sell?
• What is the competition?
• How are you better?
Give me a lever long enough
and a fulcrum on which to place,
and I shall move the world.1
Return and risk are
the two sides of the
same coin.

Trend Commandments
56
• How will you execute and manage your business?
• What are your risks?
• Why will you succeed?
Those questions are just the start of your trend following journey. The
next step is thinking deeply about your understanding of risk nuances.
There are two kinds of risk: blind and calculated. The first one, blind risk,
is always suspect. Blind risk is the calling card of laziness: the irrational hope,
something for nothing, the cold twist of fate, winning the lottery, etc. Blind
risk is the pointless gamble, the emotional decision, or the sucker play. The
man who embraces blind risk never wins in the long run.
However, calculated risk can build fortunes, nations, and empires.
Calculated risk and bold vision go hand in hand. To see the possibilities, work
things out logically, and to move forward in
strength and confidence is how you win.
Calculated risk lies at the heart of every great
achievement and achiever since the dawn of time.
Trend followers thrive on taking calculated
risks. Like the original Karate Kid movie: Wax
on, wax off. Risk on, risk off.

Trading Systems
You want to see the light? Trading coach Charles Faulkner paints a picture:
• No one can predict the future.
• If you can take the would-be, could-be, should-be out of life and look
at what actually is, you have a big advantage over most human beings.
• What matters can be measured, so keep refining your measurements.
• You don’t need to know when something will happen to know that it
will.
• Prices can only move up, down, or sideways.
• Losses are a part of life.
• There is only now.2
Now, let’s get practical. Answer the following five questions, and you
have a trend following trading system:
1. What market do you buy or sell at any time?
2. How much of a market do you buy or sell at any time?
3. When do you buy or sell a market?
4. When do you get out of a losing position?
5. When do you get out of a winning position?
Said another way:
1. What is the state of the market?
2. What is the volatility of the market?
3. What is the equity being traded?
4. What is the system or the trading orientation?
5. What is the risk aversion of the trader or client?3
You want to be black or white with this. You do not want gray. If you can
accept that mentality, you have got it.
Some might say, “Oh, I have a system.” What he typically means is that
he has a system, and it advises him what to do. If he likes the advice, he’ll take
it, and if he doesn’t like the advice, he won’t take it. That is not science. You
cannot test or simulate how you were feeling when you got out of bed 15

trade using a system, you must
slavishly use the system and avoid
discretionary overrides. You do
whatever the hell the system says
no matter how smart or dumb you
might think it is at that moment.4
Trend following systems can
vary, 
but 
principle 
elements
remain the same. A reversal system, a very common system, has two modes:
You are either long or short. It is always in the market. It closes one position
by opening a new one in the opposite direction.
Another type of system has three-phases adding a third mode: neutral,
where you are not in the market. If you are long, and you get an exit signal,
you don’t necessarily go short automatically. You can be out of the market.
Here are concrete trend following system examples to start you on the path:
• You can either be long or short at any time. You enter a long position
(and exit a short position) if the current price exceeds the highest price
in the previous 100 days. You enter a short position (and exit a long
position) if the current price drops below the lowest price in the previ-
ous 100 days. You are positioned either long or short in each market at
all times depending on the direction of the prevailing trend.6
• You allocate risk, and size your position based on each market’s histori-
cal volatility. Each market receives an equal allocation of the total port-
folio risk. Position sizes are normalized based on their volatility. The
measure of volatility that you use is called the Average True Range.
The size of your position you take in any given market is dependent
only upon the individual market’s volatility and the total account value,
that is, it is independent of any other market’s volatility or position in
your portfolio.7
• You buy when a market makes a new four-week high or sell when it
makes a new four-week low. If you are long, you go short if it makes a
new four-week low. If you are short, you go long if it makes a new
four-week high.
• You can find more systems in my book The Complete TurtleTrader and
in Technical Traders Guide to Computer Analysis of the Futures Markets
by Charles Lebeau. 
Those are sound trend following systems. There are variations and
nuances across the trend following world, but when big trends happen you
need to have an approach that can get you on board, and simple often works
best. The absolute key is, and this will never register with skeptics and critics,
Since the 1970s, and earlier, 
simple systems have demon-
strated an ability to generate 
outstanding returns.5

your discipline to stick with your
system. That will always far out-
weigh whether you have the per-
fect set of entry and exit rules. 
Further, many argue that
money management is far more
important than your entry-exit
rules. Further yet, portfolio selection is often argued to be much more
important than your money management. Keep an open eye to this. Don’t
get rigid.
Let me clarify money management. Money management, also called risk
management, position sizing, and bet sizing, is crucial. It is like sex:
Everyone does it, one way or another, but most do not want to talk about it,
and some do it better than others. When you make a decision to buy or sell
(short), you also decide at that time how many shares or contracts to buy or
sell. Accept too much risk and you increase the odds that you will go bust;
take too little risk and you will not be rewarded sufficiently.9
Posit the question, “I’ve only got a certain amount of money. How much
do I trade?” If you have $100,000 and you want to trade Microsoft, well,
how much of your $100,000 will you trade of Microsoft on your first trade?
Will you trade all $100,000? What if you’re wrong? What if you’re wrong in
a big way, and you lose your entire $100,000 on one bet? Not smart.
How do you determine how much to bet or trade each time? Trend fol-
lowers make small bet sizes initially. So, if you start at $100,000, and you’re
going to risk 2 percent, that will be $2,000. You might say to yourself, “I’ve
got $100,000, why am I only risking $2,000? $2,000 is nothing.” That’s not
the point. You can’t predict anything, so you have to be worried about your
downside, not your upside.
Risking no more than 1 percent per trade is a good place to start, and
risking more than 5 percent per trade is a sure way to the poor house.10
There is a tradeoff as you ponder how much to risk. Conservative betting
produces conservative performance, while bold betting can lead to spectacu-
lar ruin. A bold trader placing large bets feels pressure or “heat” from the
volatility of a portfolio. A “hot” portfolio keeps more at risk than does a cold
one. A portfolio risking 2 percent on each of five instruments has a total 
heat of 10 percent, as does a portfolio risking 5 percent on each of two
instruments.11
However, once you select a system, and once you have your money man-
agement thought through, no less critical is your attitude:
The markets have not changed.
They were constantly changing
then just as they are constantly
changing now.8

The thesis is simple: 
The world is chaotic.

Trade Everything
What you trade is critical. It may just be the most important issue.
Here is the conundrum: You cannot trade everything, but you cannot
trade only one market either. You need to be in a position to be following
enough markets that when a market moves you can ride it, as diversification
is the only free lunch you get. It
allows you to spread your poten-
tial targets of opportunity broadly
across currencies, interest rates,
global stock indices, grains, softs
(wheat, cotton, etc.), meats, met-
als, and energies.
You do not need to know the
market’s name. They are all the
same when you look at price data
only. If they are all the same, then
an opportunistic strategy that is ready to go when a trend starts can make you
serious money. That’s how the fortunes discussed in the earlier chapter
“Show Me the Money” were made.
The following is an example of a diversified portfolio that you could use
as a starting point for assembling your own portfolio (with the exchanges

That’s diversity, and anyone
can trade those markets today
using Exchange Traded Funds
(ETFs) or futures markets. If you
say you can’t, you are making
excuses.
It’s one thing to calculate your
risk on any one trade, but you
live and die by the sum of 
multiple risk factors, which is
why you calculate your 
portfolio risk too.3

in the markets. No one wins.
Everyone is destined to be
scared hiding under their bed.
Then you die.
Life sucks, eh?

Drawdown
In the early 1990s, Commodities
Corporation (a famed trading
incubator 
that 
taught 
and
bankrolled new traders) invited a
group of Japanese traders to its
company for in-house training.
One up-and-coming trader at
Commodities Corporation took his new friends to lunch. He told his guests
how important risk management was, and to risk only 1 percent per trade.
He was clear that experiencing small losses were part of his process to ulti-
mately finding big winners. The Japanese traders, with puzzled looks on their
faces, asked, “You have losses?”1
Ouch! Time for everyone regardless of country to learn about small
losses, and to love them, even if that means your account will occasionally
have drawdowns. What are drawdowns?
Drawdowns are those non-
fun time periods where your small
losses add up to reduce your
account size. They happen. The
key is to quickly and successfully
recover from them by sticking
with your trend trading system
and waiting patiently for big trends to reappear, which let you get back to
making new money again (and paying for all of those small losses).
How much can you lose? That’s an important question to answer, and it
comes down to the risk you take (which will vary by your personal choice).
However, trend following is much easier to believe in when you consider the
length of professional trend trading track records, especially the really long
track records that offer proof of viability. That said, some will spend a lifetime
trying to avoid any loss even though its impossible…as Chart 8 shows.
Some “win” by searching 
nonstop for the “answer,” 
even when they have it.
Some like losing, so they win by
losing money. Case in point: 
slots in Vegas.

Process versus outcome: Do you want
to be right or rich?

Entry
“You really have no control over the results; you have control over the action.”
To live that statement means
accepting certain truths. For
example, you might want to imag-
ine that there is a miraculously
perfect entry price where you buy
low. The real world doesn’t work
that way. Great trend traders have
not made their fortunes that way.
Look at a nontrading example.
I bought an investment property in
Spring 2003 for $900,000. In January 2008, it was assessed at $1.2 million,
and it was put on the market at $1.3 million. Obviously, things did not go well
for real estate in 2008, and the best offer was the original purchase price of
$900,000. It eventually sold at $1,010,000, but that barely covered costs and
was a meager return on investment.
The lesson: My original price was irrelevant. The only relevant number
was what someone would pay for it today, or the market price. It does not
matter how much you think you should get.
For example, if you enter a market at price level 50 and it goes to 100, does
it really make a difference whether you got in at 52 or 60 or 70? Even if you
got in at 70 and the market went to 100, you still made a lot, right? There are
plenty of traders out there who think: “Oh, I couldn’t get in at 52, so I won’t
get in at all.” Even if you had the chance to get in at 70 on a market that even-
tually goes to 100, some sit on the sidelines still dreaming of buying ‘cheap’!
Bottom line, entry is a very small concern—once you are in.1
Assume GOOG is trading between 500 and 550. All of a sudden GOOG
jumps, or breaks out, to a price level of 600. That type of upward movement
from a range is a trigger—the breakout for an entry. You might say, “I don’t
know if GOOG is going to continue up, but it’s been going sideways for six
months, and all of a sudden, the price has jumped to 600 making a new 
six-month highest high. I’m in.”
You are not in this game to
find bargains. You are in this to
follow trends, and if the market is
heading up, enter. If the market is
heading down, enter short.
“If facing in the right direction,
all you have to do is keep on
walking.” That is a Japanese
trend following proverb…or at
least I made it one.
The three best entry indicators
in order are price, price, 
and price.

If trend trader Amos 
Hostetter of Commodities 
Corporation lost 25 percent, 
he’d exit: 
“Never mind the cheese. 
Let me out of the trap.”

This Way to the Egress
The paramount factor when the market goes against you is being able to say:
“I’m out!” You need a prenuptial agreement with the market.1
That means the time to think most clearly about when you will exit is
before you ever get in. A set in advance sell strategy gives you the opportu-
nity to not only preserve capital (you need chips to play afterall), but to rede-
ploy your limited capital to more favorable markets.
How do trend traders get out of a losing position? Fast! For example, you
enter gold with a 2 percent stop loss. This means if you lose 2 percent, you
exit. Period. Get out. There is no debate.
Think of it this way: If half of the time your trades go in your direction,
you are hitting a good average. Even being right three or four times out of
ten will yield a windfall if your losses are cut quickly when you are wrong.
You will never get in at the beginning of a trend or get out at the top.
Picking tops and bottoms is not the objective. Think about the often-
repeated phrase profit targets. Problem? They cap profits. For example, you
enter some market at price level
100 and you decide that you will
exit if the price hits 125. That may
sound rational, but it is ignorant
when re-evealuated.
If you are riding a trend, you
have to let it go as far as it can go.
You need to fully exploit the
length of the move. You do not
want to exit at 125 and watch the
trend go to 225.
You need home run trends to pay for your small losses. If you are artifi-
cially creating a profit target for no other reason than comfort, you are pre-
maturely stopping those potential big trends that actually get you rich. It’s a
vicious circle if you do not handle it properly from the beginning.
A new trader approached an old
bold trend follower and asked,
“What’s your objective on this
trade?” He replied, 
“For it to go to the moon.”2

For example, you know your $50,000 account can go to $80,000, back
to $55,000, back up to $90,000, and from there all the way up to $200,000.
Take profits at $80,000 and you can’t ride it up to $200,000. Letting prof-
its run may feel counterintuitive psychologically, but trying to protect every
penny of profit will actually prevent your big profits. Guaranteed.
Declare victory and
get out. That means
using stops and
sticking to them.

Losers Average Losers
There is a famous picture of a well-known trader relaxing in his office with
his feet kicked up. A single sheet of loose-leaf paper is tacked on the wall
behind him with the simple phrase written out in black marker:
“Losers Average Losers”
Trite meaningless talk? Not so fast.
Famed trader Jesse Livermore warned 100
years ago against averaging losses. For example,
you buy a stock at 50 and two or three days later
if you can buy it at 47, you average down by buy-
ing another hundred shares, making an average
price of 48.5. Having bought at 50 and being
concerned over a three-point loss on a hundred shares, what rhyme or rea-
son is there in adding another hundred shares and having the double worry
when the price hits 44? At that point, there would be a $600 loss on the first
hundred shares and a $300 loss on the second shares. If you are able to apply
such an unsound principle, you can keep on averaging down by buying 200
at 44, then 400 at 41, 800 at 38, 1600 at 35, 3200 at 32, 6400 at 29, and
so on.1
“Don’t frown, double down!” Not smart strategy.
Losses are a part of the game. You want no
losses? You want positive returns every month? It
does not work that way, that is, not unless you
were lucky enough to be invested in the Bernard
Madoff Ponzi-scheme—which has resulted in
assorted criminal convictions and a few suicides.
Losses are not your problem. It’s how you
react to them. Ignore losses with no plan, or try
to double down on your losses to recoup, and
those losses will come back like a Mack truck to
run over your account.
Escalator up,
express elevator
down.
You can’t win if 
you are not willing
to lose. 
It’s like breathing
in, but not 
breathing out.2

Slow everything down. 
Don’t compete with the phony speed
of society. Be a snake. 
Coil and strike when the 
time is right.

Home Run
Some companies, and individuals, stress the short-term performance of trend
followers. They look at one month’s performance, see a down month, and
panic. They have complete ignorance of the long-term objective—big money.
How bad can it get? I have seen trend following traders make 100 per-
cent in a year followed by a year where they lost 5 percent. That 5 percent
loss causes some critics to not see the 100 percent number. That is insane
thinking.
Just like a baseball player’s batting average can have short-term up or
down streaks over the course of a season, trend followers have streaks. Trend
following performance will deviate from averages, but over time there is
remarkable consistency when it comes to putting up big returns—as long as
unpredictable home runs are allowed to happen naturally and unforced.
The leading thinkers across varied fields, including insurance, casino
gambling, and investing, all emphasize the same point. It’s the Babe Ruth
effect: Even though Ruth struck out a lot, he was one of baseball’s greatest
hitters. The home runs made up for his strikeouts.1
A trend follower coaching a baseball team
would approach it like the former manager of the
Baltimore Orioles. Earl Weaver designed his
offenses to maximize the chance of a three-run
homer. Weaver did not bunt or want guys who
slapped singles. He wanted guys who hit big
home runs.2
Trading is a waiting game. You sit, you wait,
and you make a lot of money all at once. Profits
come in bunches. The trick when going sideways
between home runs is not to lose too much in
between.3
Think about Madoff again. He fooled some of the United States’ wealth-
iest individuals and charities. Mind you, I did not say America’s smartest.
Madoff knew one thing: He did not have to make big returns. All he had to
do was fake 1 percent per month. That 1 percent per month was enough to
satisfy believers.
I was at a conference in Brazil. My speaking time slot was on the second
day. All the speakers, and this included many bright and accomplished peo-
ple, kept lamenting how to spot the next Madoff. My simple answer: If an

investment delivers 1 percent per month every month, with no down
months, that investment is either a royal scam or a hidden disaster that will
eventually blow up. Don’t be snookered with consistency. Don’t just
believe—verify. 
You should come to realize that trend following’s unpredictable home
runs are a much safer course of action.

Robust
The occasional crank will whine this, or that. They always want it fast. They
yearn for millions yesterday. I’ll never understand why they can’t relax and
see that understanding and applying trend following takes time. It’s not hard
to digest conceptually, but it takes some time to understand the nuance and
execute correctly.
For example, consider a high
winning percentage. You’ve seen
the carnival barkers on TV saying
they’ve got a trading method that
will make you a fortune because
they have entry signals 90 percent
accurate. Grab your wallet. It’s
about to be picked. You are about
to be fleeced.
A high percentage of winning trades should not be your focus. A need to
be “right” misses the point. Pretend you trade 100 times in a year. The aver-
age winning trade makes you a net $100, and you make a net $9,000 for the
winners. But the ten losing trades are for $1,000 each so you lose a total of
$10,000 for the year in a system that had 90 percent winners. Not smart.2
That example leads to a broader issue behind trend following success.
For a trend trading system to be successful, it needs to be robust. Assume you
are trading Treasury Bonds and you switch to gold. Your system needs to still
work. And if you switch to corn, something totally different from Treasury
Bonds, it must work. Wear a loose-fitting suit. You can’t have a suit so tight
that if you gain two pounds it
won’t fit.3
To have a loose-fitting suit
requires your trading system to be
simple and intuitive. This means
trend following rules that you
could conceptually write down on
the back of an envelope. If you
can’t do that, you can’t win in the
long run.
All trend trading systems must
hold up under as many different
situations and market conditions
as possible, and work as well no
matter how markets evolve.1
Nobody can demonstrate that a
complex mathematical equation
can answer the simple question:
Is the market moving up, down,
or sideways?4

Push the Button
On January 24, 1984, Apple Computer introduced Macintosh. The advent
of Apple has had its pros and cons. They have made life more fun for us. They
have made life more organized. Yet they are still just tools. Computers do not
think for us. Sure, a nice Mac or PC can help automate your life and make
the daily grind easier, but they are no substitute for thought.
Great trend following traders know this.
They take their trading rules and translate them
into machine code to make life easier. If you have
a new trading idea, a computer is the best tool for
allowing you to see an idea applied over vast
amounts of historical data. It puts our emotions
to the side and makes testing binary.
For example, if your boyfriend or girlfriend
breaks up with you, you’ll feel one subjective way
unique to you. If you get engaged, you’ll feel another way unique to your sit-
uation. The computer does not care, nor is it affected by your subejctive
emotional whatever.2
Some retort back: “Why go the computer route if people power is so
important?” It of course starts with people power, but great trend traders
have proven that the computer route works. It is replicable—which equals
confidence. If you have the same rules as someone else you can get similar
results, and computers allow you to test that
fast.3
Computers are not perfect though. You can
easily overoptimize or curve fit a trading system,
and produce a system that looks good on paper
or screen alone. By testing thousands of possibil-
ities, you can create a system that works in the-
ory, but not the real world.
This, however, is all up against many com-
peting messages. When you flip on the TV and
see pitch men screaming at you (read: Wall Street “analysts”), causing instant
aneurysms for the still sane, just remember “Red light! Green light! Two
screens! Three screens!” is theatrics.
Human cogitation allows the creation of a great trend trading system,
that’s not loose sales talk or manic promises. Is there a risk that you mind-
lessly let the computer—like the machine in War Games—take over and do

as it pleases? No. Do you change your trading system regularly? No, because
your thinking and effort are behind the system you put into the computer.4
Pablo Picasso famously said, “Computers are useless. They can only give
you answers.” Start with your questions first. Automating your answers is the
easy part.
A computer can let you evaluate
5,000 charts in the time it would
take you to study 10 manually.
However, if your original system
is flawed, doing it wrong 500
times faster doesn’t help.5

It’s all a matter of 
perspective.
What some consider a 
catastrophic flood, 
others deem a 
cleansing bath.1

Wash, Rinse, Repeat
“Hey, I’m gonna get you too…another one bites the dust.”
Another one really does bite the dust every few minutes. That does not
mean a discussion of death, and of course people are dying, but rather mil-
lions are making horrendous decisions with their money (i.e., mutual funds,
index investing, value investing, gurus, etc.). Further, if you think that you
are going to get rich by listening to Dave Ramsey talking about decreasing
your credit card debt, you got another thing coming.
With cable news and the Internet screaming information nonstop, every
minute, all the time, people have just been conditioned to think events move
too fast, and that they can’t keep up or make winning decisions. Millions
have thrown their hands up and screamed uncle.
I see it. I empathize. But you have to move on from that. You have to
develop an understanding of how the game really works if you want to get
ahead.
For example, Wall Street is known for corporate collapses and hedge fund
blow-ups that transfer capital from winners to losers and back again.
However, the winners always seem to be missing from the after-the-fact
analysis. The press and the public are only fascinated with the losers.
Everyone is oblivious to the other side of the story: the winners and why.
The academics locked away with job security
tenure always come up short in their analysis:
“It’s a zero-sum game. For every loser there’s a
winner, but you can’t always be specific about
who the winner is.”2
Not true.
John W. Henry made a fortune going short
the Nikkei, while Nick Leeson and Barings Bank
were long. That’s a major winner right there.3 My political science back-
ground allowed me to see that; others should be able to see it too.
However, many look at events through the wrong lens. Deep down the
money elite know that standard finance theory has no explanation for the
winners of low-probability, high-impact events.4 The bottom line is that big,
unexpected events make trend traders rich. They exploit Black Swan events
(see Nassim Taleb’s book of the same name for more).
Bear markets cause
events more than
events cause bear
markets.

What do I mean? When a major event occurs, such as the Russian debt
default of August 1998, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or the
2002 and 2008 equity market crashes, events accelerate existing trends to
even greater magnitudes.5
Unexpected events will never stop. People are people and there are
always poor market strategies to exploit. Those with poor strategies are for-
ever being cycled and recycled into the markets, giving continuous opportu-
nities to capitalize on their missteps and take
their money. And with so many people playing
the big money game with such awful strategy, the
next surprise win for trend following traders is
right around the corner.
Isn’t history littered
with surprises?

Zero-Sum
In a zero-sum game, someone can win only if somebody else loses.1
On any given market transaction, the chance of you winning or losing
may be near even, but in the long run, you will only profit from trading
because you have some persistent advantage (read: mathematical edge) that
allows you to win slightly more often than losing.2
If you have ever played poker or studied edges in gambling, the words
ring true: To trade profitably in the long run, you will know your edge, you
will know when it exists, and you will exploit it when you can. If you have no
edge, you can’t trade for profit. If you know you have no edge, but you are
trading for other reasons, you will lose.3
The players in markets who
lose over the long run are gener-
ally commercial hedgers. The 
reason for this is that hedgers use
the markets for risk insurance, and
insurance premiums always cost
money.4 Of course, other specula-
tors with bad strategy can provide
winners with their gains too.
As counterintuitive as it
seems, if you buy higher highs and sell short lower lows, and you use solid
money management to manage and exit trades, you can find a mathematical
edge in the long run. This keeps you opposite hedgers as much as possible.
It is not rocket science by any means, but it holds up over time very robustly.6
The market is brutal. Forget trying to be
loved. Need a friend? Get a dog. If you are going
to win, someone else will lose, either through their
hedging or their bad strategy. Does survival of the
fittest make you uneasy? Stay out of the zero-sum
game.
Buying high and selling low,
over the long run, keeps you
opposite hedgers who 
eventually pay for the privilege
of transferring their risk 
to the markets.5
Someone’s gotta
lose for you to win.7

Crash and Burn
The world changed in October 2008. Stock markets crashed. Millions lost
their retirement money when their buy-and-hold strategies imploded. The
Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq fell like stones. Most everyone has felt the ramifica-
tions: jobs lost, firms bankrupt, and universal fear still to this day causing
daily heartburn.
No one made money during 2008. Everyone
lost. Is that really true? No. There were trend fol-
lowing winners during October 2008, and they
made fortunes ranging from +5 percent to +40
percent in that single month. How did they do
it? First, let me state how they did not do it:
• Trend followers did not know stock markets would crash in October
2008.
• Trend followers did not make all of their money from shorting stocks in
October 2008.
What did they do exactly? Trend followers made money in many differ-
ent markets: oil, bonds, currencies, stocks, and commodities—via up and
down trends going both long and short. Of course, there was zilch press cov-
erage of their big wins. Academics and their peer-reviewed journals—nope—
they were at the three-martini lunch too. Lack of public profile is nothing
new—trend following anonymity goes back 50 years. (I probably have the
most complete private trend following library available, but very little of it is
online or at universities.)
The reason trend following performs so well when equity markets per-
form worst is straightforward: When an event happens, it reinforces a crisis
mentality already in place, and trends drive toward a final conclusion—where
the really big money is made as fear reaches a zenith, and markets go para-
bolic. This is the reason trend following rarely gets caught on the wrong side
of an event (or crash)—there is almost always advanced warning for those
who observe price action.2
Competing messages can make that simple wisdom difficult to accept.
The magazine Wired recently described the issues:
Market boom goes
to market ka-boom!

Complexity researchers who study behavior of stock markets may have
identified a signal that precedes crashes. They say the telltale sign is a
measure of co-movement, or the likelihood of stocks to move in the
same direction. When a market is healthy, co-movement is low. But in
the months and years before a crash, co-movement seems to grow.
“The financial crisis has shown that mainstream economic theories
have limitations that need to be overcome,” said Dirk Helbing of the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, who specializes in modeling
crowd behavior. “Economic systems have become much more com-
plex, and complex systems have certain features—cascading effects,
systemic shifts. This calls for new theoretical approaches.”3
When will mainstream publications, the ones who love to reveal new
thinking, learn that strategies that take advantage of crashes already exist?
Surprise: trend following.
To do that means you must
have a portfolio with enough
exposure to diverse global markets
to allow you to make the crazy
money during the big events. And
there will inevitably be more sur-
prise events with headline-generat-
ing losers taking the perp walk in
the press, with the winners going
unknown.
That is a prediction worth betting on.
Trends do not continue on to

Inefficient Markets
The hedge fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) went bust in
1998, and that event is more relevant today than ever. It laid the foundation
for government induced bubble/bailout schemes still employed daily.
LTCM promised to use complex mathematical models to make investors
wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. It attracted elite Wall Street investors
and initially reaped fantastic profits with secret money-making strategies.
Ultimately, its theories collided with reality.
To understand the LTCM debacle, it starts with two academic legends:
Merton Miller and Eugene F. Fama who developed the Efficient-Markets
Hypothesis. The premise of their hypothesis was that stock prices were always
right so you could not divine the market’s future direction. It assumed that
everyone was rational.2
Miller and Fama believed that perfectly rational people would never pay
more or less for a financial instrument than it was actually worth. A colleague,
and fervent supporter of the Efficient-Markets Hypothesis, Myron Scholes
was also certain that markets could not make mistakes. He and his associate,
Robert Merton, saw the finance universe as tidy and predictable.
They assumed that the price of IBM would never go directly from 80 to
60 but would always stop at 79 3/4, 79 1/2, and 79 1/4 along the way.3
LTCM’s founders believed the market was a perfect normal distribution with
no outliers, no fat tails, and no unexpected events.
Once Wall Street was convinced by LTCM
that the markets were a nice, pleasant, orderly,
and continuous normal distribution, with no risk,
LTCM began using mammoth leverage for sup-
posedly risk-free big returns. That is where prob-
lems started. They ignored the unexpected in
their strategy. If a random bolt of lightning hits
you when you are standing in the middle of a
field, it might feel like a random event. But if your business is to stand in ran-
dom fields during lightning storms, then you are clearly ignoring obvious and
real risks.4
Trend followers made a killing as LTCM went through the cheese grater.
Returns for trend following traders in August and September of 1998 were
almost like one continuous credit card swipe direct from LTCM. LTCM lost
billions and top trend followers made billions.5
If a trader believes
he’s got magic over
discipline, run for
the hills, partner.

Yet it’s worse than just one hedge fund blowing up and trend followers
winning again. Eugene Fama’s efficient market misstep has also given mutual
funds the cover they needed to raise massive assets (and milk insane fees out
of the average Joe).
For the last 30 years, there has been a sophisticated marketing campaign,
boosted by an even more sophisticated political lobbying campaign, all
designed to convince everyone attached to the matrix that they could do no
better than guessing or throwing darts, so in turn just “invest all of your
money in mutual funds and hold on for the long term” (long term is never
usefully defined of course; it could be your death).
For a man who has the numbers against him, Fama remains defiant in the
face of his intellectual defeat. Recently he was asked this question about tech-
nical trading (read: trend following): “Some researchers argue that a market-
timing strategy based on buy/sell signals generated by a 50- or 200-day
moving average offers a more appealing combination of risk and return than
a buy-and-hold approach. What is your view?”
Fama responded: “An ancient tale with no empirical support.” Clearly,
Fama has no answer for the reality of trend following performance. He would
rather commit Seppuku—a form of Japanese ritual suicide—than admit an
error. He would rather die with honor than fall into the hands of superior
market wisdom.6
Having lived through the financial crisis of
2007–08, the man in the street knows markets
are not efficient. But the Efficient-Market
Hypothesis, like a Hollywood monster, has
proved very hard to kill off.7
Fortunately for you, there is a way out. There
is inspiration. The great trend followers are not
academics, magicians, charlatans, or pedigreed
investment bankers. They are self-starter entre-
preneurs who, through concentration, drive, and
fierce independent streaks, have cultivated that rare knowledge to mint
money. Trend following proves daily that the Efficient-Markets Hypothesis
has more in common with Scientology, versus any useful trading enlighten-
ment. Understand the comparisons made herein. It’s all part of you inter-
preting the puzzle.

Who’s to blame? 
Well certainly, there are those more
responsible than others,
and they will be held accountable,
but again, truth be told, if you’re 
looking for the guilty, you need only
look into a mirror.1

Benchmark
If you base your trading strategy on benchmark comparisons, it does not
matter whether you are a brilliant trader. All your decisions are made with
respect to what the averages are doing, so just sit back and take whatever the
market gives you.
One of the main reasons trend following trading performs so well is
because it has no quarterly performance constraints. What does that mean
exactly? Both Wall Street and Main Street measure success on the artificial
constraints of the calendar year.
An unnatural fascination with quarterly and yearly performance report-
ing implies you can predict the market or successfully shoot for profit targets.
Quarters provide a comfortable structure for those who mistakenly believe
they can demand nice, consistent profits in the time frame of their choosing.
(“I want to make money in the third quarter.”) This demand for consistency
and predictability has led to a fruitless search for the trading Holy Grail. 
Imagine you are playing American football. There are four quarters, and
you have to score in each quarter to win. Imagine placing more importance
on scoring in each quarter than winning the game. “I might score 28 points
in any of the four quarters. I might score at any point in the game, but the
object, at the end of the game is to win.” If you score 28 points in the first
quarter and no points in the next three quarters, and win, who cares when
you scored?
Wall Street’s misguided emphasis on quarterly performance puts more
importance on scoring each quarter than it does on winning the game.
Seriously, how many bad Star Trek jokes about Spock logic could be inserted
to counter this craziness? 
One big-name trader publicly lamented quarterly reporting comparing it
to a necessary but incompetent baseball umpire: “If you don’t have an
umpire, you can wait for the fat pitch. The trouble with investing for other
people…is that you do have an umpire—called quarterly performance.”2
If so many market players know the umpire of quarterly performance is
ridiculous, why do they stick with it? Wall Street has done it on purpose. The
corporate quarterly earnings “seasons” are attempts to push up stocks by slic-
ing and dicing statistics to portray companies in their best possible light.

Trend Commandments
106
Similarly, each time an administration changes the government, watch
closely how the quarterly and monthly labor and GDP statistics change and
are recalibrated to portray the incumbent political party in the best possible
light.
Quarterly measure and benchmarks are not behind trend following for-
tunes. Trend following in its purest form is about absolute returns—making
the most money possible while not tied to some random calendar date. I
know this all might seem pedantic, but look at how much of our economy is
tied to this backward way of thinking.
In a nation ruled by swine, all
pigs are upwardly mobile and
the rest of us are f***ed until
we can put our acts together:
not necessarily to win, but
mainly to keep from losing 
completely. We owe that to 
ourselves and our 
crippled self-image as some-
thing better than a nation of
panicked sheep.3

Haters
Big events allow huge money to change hands and that often brings public
whinings and floggings. Many critics pose meaning of life questions when
one group loses dramatically in public to another group. Their caring is
heartfelt. They ask the virtuous questions:
1. What do these events tell us about our society?
2. Are these financial losses the dark side of all the benefits of financial
derivatives?
3. Should we change the way we do things?
4. Should the society accept these financial losses as part of the “survival
of the fittest” in the world of business?
5. Should legislation be used to avoid these events?2
These questions are designed to absolve the guilt of market losers for
their bad strategy. A free market is no place for political excuses, social engi-
neering, or more bailouts. 
Consider fund manager Anthony Ward. He supposedly “cornered” the
cocoa market. By one estimate, he bought enough to make five billion
chocolate bars. Critics accused him of stockpiling cocoa to drive up prices so
he could sell later at a profit. (Cocoa prices on the London market were at a
30-year high.)3
One bright trader tries to
make a dollar in an open market,
and rival traders complain that he
is trying to make money? What
are they trying to do? Lose money?
It gets worse. One reader
recently asked about the value
trend following added, beyond the potential profit. That’s a very odd ques-
tion. What more value does he want? You trade, you make money, and that’s
it. Look at the case of John Paulson, the man who made a fortune betting
against real estate. 
A note posted about his success caught my eye: “Left unexamined is the
uncomfortable moral dimension of Paulson’s achievement. If he saw this
coming, was it right for him to keep his own counsel, quietly trading while

wisdom. To paraphrase

the financial system melted down? Do traders who figure out a way to 
profit from our misery deserve our contempt or our admiration, however
grudging?”
Paulson deserves admiration. If you hate Paulson’s success (and if/until
it is proven he did it dishonorably), you have issues to work out with your
shrink. The profit opportunity was there for all. He had the same informa-
tion or less over banks, government, and bigger
funds who lost big. He was making trades with
the very banks that went bankrupt. Paulson
chose to leave the crowd and bet with a novel
strategy. Salute, not scorn.
Blaming winners reminds me of the reaction

The Simpsons. Everyone screams: “Let’s burn

The Root of All Evil
Thanks to Facebook, generations are willing to share anything and everything.
However, many are still ambivalent about money. Some want more
money, but feel guilty about openly admitting it. A few have lots and feel
guilty for reasons that don’t make sense. Many feel guilt if they did not come
about it honestly (as they should) or at least in proportion to their labor to
achieve it. Some dream of making a sex tape and building a reality TV
empire. Fair enough. Yet take a moment to think through your motivations
for trading. If you have any reason for trading except to make money, find
something else to do and avoid the stress from the start.
There is nothing good or bad about money. Money is just a tool. Ayn
Rand countered brilliantly the desire of some to classify money as evil: “You
think that money is the root of all evil? Have you ever asked what is the root
of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which
can’t exist unless there are goods produced and
men able to produce them. Money is the mate-
rial shape of the principle that men who wish to
deal with one another must deal by trade and
give value for value. Money is not the tool of the
moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of
the looters, who take it from you by force.
Money is made possible by the men who pro-
duce. Is that what you consider evil?”2
If all ethical people think money is bad, who’s going to get the money?3
That’s my question. Here is a great example of money and emotions in full
bloom. Years back, talk show king Phil Donahue was interviewing free-
market economist Milton Friedman. He wanted to know if Friedman had
ever had a moment of doubt about capitalism and whether he thought greed
was really a good idea.
Friedman was quick in response: “Is there some society you know that
doesn’t run on greed? You think Russia doesn’t run on greed? You think
China doesn’t run on greed? The world runs on individuals pursuing their
separate interests. The great achievements of civilization have not come from

government bureaus. Einstein didn’t construct his theory under order from
a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn’t revolutionize the automobile industry that
way. The only cases in which the masses have escaped from the kind of grind-
ing poverty you’re talking about, the only cases in recorded history, are
where they have had capitalism and largely free trade. If you want to know
where the masses are worst off, it’s exactly in the kinds of societies that depart
from that.”4
Donahue countered that capitalism doesn’t reward virtue, but instead
rewards the ability to manipulate the system. Friedman balked: “And what
does reward virtue? You think the communist commissar rewards virtue? Do
you think American presidents reward virtue? Do they choose their
appointees on the basis of the virtue of the people appointed or on the basis
of their political clout? Is it really true that political self-interest is nobler
somehow than economic self-interest? Just tell me where in the world you
find these angels who are going to organize society for us?”5
America has long seen certain contingents push the belief that there
could be a government angel to let the proletariat have more money—with
no effort.
Consider President Franklin Delano Roosevelt talking to America on
January 11, 1944. He gave a caring government hug across the airwaves as
he proposed what he called a second Bill of Rights—an economic Bill of
Rights for all regardless of station, race, or creed that included
• The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or
farms or mines of the nation.
• The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and
recreation.
• The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return that
will give him and his family a decent living.
• The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmos-
phere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopo-
lies at home or abroad.
• The right of every family to a decent home.
• The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and
enjoy good health.
• The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age,
sickness, accident, and unemployment.
• The right to a good education.6

You need to decide how much money you want

do you want a lot? Or are you satisfied believing

Panicky Sheep
You see them. Maybe you are one. Some are so connected to their
BlackBerry, they can’t imagine it not being in their hand 24/7. Compulsive
gaming. Second Life. Sparknotes. People are looking at screens, sometimes
multiple screens. Some think teaching students to multitask is important for
future jobs. Jobs doing what? Serving Ritalin with a splash of Patrón?
Attention deficit disorder is so
pervasive, and so ubiquitous, that
very few of us even see it as a
major 
concern. 
People 
are
supremely distracted, and that
equals behaviors driven by the
moment. Not behaviors purpose-
ful and thought out.
While making a documentary
film (brokemovie.com), one of
the first places my crew visited was
a sheep farm. Those animals were
so scared to be separated from the
group it is terribly hard to put
their fear into words. Late in the
day of the shoot, I got really close
to the herd and tried to split them
in half. They panicked to reform
their group. They had to get back
to one cohesive crowd. They
made no sounds. Their faces were
expressionless. They just moved their feet—fast.
Humans live to be part of a group too: The group offers safety, confir-
mation, and simplifies decision-making. Further, if something goes wrong, it
is far more comforting to be with others than to be alone—the old saying,
“misery loves company,” rings true. However, the successful trader has to be
willing to separate from the crowd—to be a contrarian—even though you
might always have a strong emotional urge to stay with the group.
Additionally, human sheep behavior is shaped further by a proliferation
of electronic goodies. Greed, hope, fear, denial, herd behavior, impulsiveness,
and impatience are jacked up on gadget steroids. This is a recipe and foun-
dation for manias and bubbles ad infinitum.2

Daniel Kahneman, the first psychologist to win the Nobel Prize in
Economics, attributed market manias to investors’ illusion of control, calling
this illusion Prospect Theory. He wanted to know: How do people estimate
odds and calculate risks? The short answer: Not smartly.3
People dislike losses so much that they will make nonstop irrational deci-
sions in vain attempts to avoid the pain. This explains why traders, for exam-
ple, sell winners too early but hold on to losers too long. It is human nature
to take profit from a winner quickly on the assumption that it will not last for
long, but stick with a loser in the hope it will bounce back.4
The typical trader acts on the “law of small numbers”—basing decisions
on statistically insignificant examples. For instance, if you buy a fund that has
beaten the market three years in a
row, it is easy to become seduced
that it’s on a hot streak. It is hard
for us to stop overgeneralizing.
Limited empirical evidence is what
drives life these days.5
Any discussion of why traders
are their own worst enemies starts
with sunk costs. A sunk cost is a
cost incurred you cannot retrieve. Although sunk costs should not affect your
current decisions, people have a tough time leaving the past. Some will buy
more of a losing stock just because of their initial decision to buy it. You can
say proudly, “I bought on a discount!” or “I got it cheap.” Of course, if that
stock goes to zero, your theory dies.
Unfortunately, many are ambivalent to sunk costs. Intellectually, you
might know that there is nothing you can do about money already spent, but
emotionally dwelling on it is standard operating sheep deportment.
An experiment with a $10 theater ticket illus-
trates this. One group of students was told to
imagine they had arrived at a theater only to dis-
cover they had lost their ticket. Would they pay
another $10 to buy another ticket? A second
group was told to imagine that they were going
to a play, but had not yet bought a ticket. When
they arrived at the theater, they realized they lost
a $10 bill. Would they still buy a ticket? In both
cases, the students were presented with the same question: Would you spend
$10 to see the play? Eighty-eight percent of the second group, which had lost
the $10 bill, opted to buy the ticket. However, the first group, the ticket

losers, focusing on sunk costs, asked the question differently: Am I willing to
spend $20 to see a $10 play? Only 46 percent said yes.6
What are some additional behaviors that virtually guarantee losses in the
markets?
• Lack of discipline: It takes an accumulation of knowledge and sharp
focus to trade successfully. Many would rather listen to the advice of
others. They just want to believe, like Fox Mulder.
• Impatience: Some have an insatiable need for action. The day trading
adrenaline rush and the gamblers’ high can have heroin-like addiction
pull.
• No objectivity: Some are unable to disengage emotionally from the
market. They create a virtual “lifelong” marriage to their trades.
Divorce is not an option.
• Greed: A desire for quick profit blinds many from the diligent work
needed to actually win in the long run.
• Refusal to accept truth: Some do not want to believe that the only
knowable truth is price action. They feel more secure following cult
leaders serving Kool-Aid.
• Impulsive behavior: Many jump into investments based on the morning
paper or Good Morning America. Thinking that if you act quickly,
somehow you will beat everybody else in the great race is a recipe for a
messy failure.
• Inability to stay in the moment of now: To be a successful trader, you
cannot spend your time thinking about how you are going to spend
your profits. Trading because you have to have money is not workable.
• Stay open-minded: Come into the day knowing your future steps. Do
not be stubborn when the market does not go your way. Cut your
losses and follow your stinking trading plan.
• Avoid false parallels: Just because the market behaved one way in 1995,
2000, or 2008 does not mean a similar pattern today will give you the
same result. A great example of this: The Hindenburg Omen. It is a
technical analysis pattern that is said to portend a stock market crash.
The problem: Sometimes it is right, sometimes not. You don’t want to
bet your life savings on a coin flip.
These behaviors all remind us that unlike in the animal world, where a
threat passes quickly, humans live in constant stress. For 99 percent of ani-
mals, stress is about three minutes of screaming terror and the threat is over.
We turn on the exact same stress response when pondering 30-year mort-
gages. What is quickly emerging as the biggest public-health problem

IQ vs. EQ
Many believe academic intelligence is the direct path to reaping a fortune.
Some literally tout their IQ—as if their IQ is money in their bank account.
One longtime trend follower drilled that nonsensical stance: “I haven’t seen
much correlation between good trading and intelligence. Some outstanding
traders are quite intelligent, but a few are not. Many outstandingly intelligent
people are horrible traders. Average intelligence is enough. Beyond that,
emotional makeup is more important.”2
In an interview with one legendary trader, it
struck me how he chose to begin. He opened by
saying that when he was in kindergarten, he
failed blocks. That humor is from a man worth
north of 100 million. He is smart, but his point:
IQ is no magic elixir. 
Not only do people fall into the “IQ equals
success” trap, they fall prey to thinking that a
degree will take them to the top. That’s 100% not true (see the book
Linchpin for more). In fact, recent research takes my point further:
[Look at] the livelihoods of plumbers and doctors. Yes, doctors have
a bigger salary. But, doctors have to endure nearly a decade of
expensive education before making any real salary, after which the
doctor is hit by a very high progressive tax rate. Because of all the
costs the doctor incurs, the taxes and the lost wages…plumbers make
more, and have almost the same spending power over their lifetime
as general practitioners.3
Consider those who pursue academic PhDs. A PhD is a specialist, not a
generalist. In the real world, not the academic one, the generalist is today’s
winner. Not all PhDs are motivated entrepreneurial competitors capable 
of “killing it” (of course there are exceptions). A PhD, or any degree, does
not protect you from failure. A degree says more than anything that we
passed the test.
My comments are no knock against degree winners, but they are a
reminder that it is you against the world. If you have a degree, any degree,
that’s awesome. I have three letters behind my name, but so what? Don’t use
the degree on the wall billboard, circa 1950s Leave it to Beaver America, to
imply you are special. Those days are long gone…or maybe not!
Credentialism is the
short cut that

The Associated Press recently ran with this frightening slug line:
NEW YORK—Today’s college students are more narcissistic and
self-centered than their predecessors, according to a comprehensive
new study by five psychologists who worry that the trend could be
harmful to personal relationships and American society. Stop end-
lessly repeating “You’re special” and having children repeat that
back. Kids are self-centered enough already.
I see those kids everyday—most are adults!
Some of the factors that will

ability to enter the flow. These

garnering profits from the mar-

other facets of trading, even when leaving the mental part out is guaranteed
long-term failure.5
This is not easy. Biological impulses are drivers of our emotions. There is
no way to escape that fact, but you can learn to self-regulate your feelings
and, in so doing, manage situations where emotions can interfere with sound
decision-making—like in the markets. Self-regulation is the ongoing inner
conversation that emotionally intelligent people engage in to not be a pris-
oner to their feelings.6
The ability to delay gratification, stifle impulsiveness, and shake off the
inevitable setbacks and upsets is critical. Without emotional intelligence, you
can have superior trend following training and systems, using an incisive and
analytical mind with infinite creativity, and still fail.7
How can you start down that right path? The path to accepting the 
emotional part of your consciousness means focusing on improving your
happiness:
• Do not equate happiness with money. You will acclimate quickly to
shifts in income, but long-lasting benefits for all of us are negligible.
• Regular exercise generates energy and stimulates mind and body. Just
do it.
• Having sex, preferably with someone you love, is often rated among
the highest generators of happiness.
• Close relationships require serious work and effort, but pay huge
rewards.

I’m not an MBA, so I didn’t

IQ vs. EQ

• Take time to appreciate the good things in life, a very simple habit that
will help keep you from trouble.
• Seek work that engages your skills. It makes sense to work at some-
thing you enjoy.
• Sleep. Eight hours. Mandatory.
• Take control of your life and set achievable goals.
Follow all rules and please don’t ask if these are actually relevant to trend
following success.8

American Football coach 
Jim Harbaugh would often ask his college
players to name the one thing needed 
to make an NFL team.
The answers would come firing out: 
“You have to be talented.”
“You have to work hard.”
No, Harbaugh would retort.
“A lot of guys are talented and work hard
and never make it.
The one thing you have to do to make 
an NFL team is take another man’s 
job away from him.
And those men really like those jobs.” 1

Commitment
What does life-changing commitment involve? Most people want to be right.
They get satisfaction in having other people know that they are right. They
seemingly do not want success. They do not appear to want winning. They
do not seem to care much about money. They simply want to be right.
Winners just want to win.
That means you commit to patience and faith in a trading system that is
not structured on quarterly reporting or some other artificial measure of the
masses (read: sheep). You work hard to gain experience and knowledge. You
commit to thinking and planning for the long term. Don’t worry too much
about the dollar amount in your paycheck from the man. Do not live by the
herd’s standard of salary success—those usually suck.
Further, simply reading trading philosophies and rules alone will not
make you hungry. If you do not want to win, if you do not have it in your
makeup, or if you cannot figure out how to put it into your makeup, you will
lose.
Commitment to trend following is just like the commitment needed to
be a top athlete. If you want to be a fantastic baseball player, you go to the
batting cages on Friday night while your buddies are partying. You never give
up the focus. By the time you get to the big leagues, you have what you want.
However, the only reason you reached that goal is because you made the
commitment at the outset to be a winner. Everyone wants the big leagues
and the big money, but are you committed to making it happen with relent-
less and spirited determination?
Many do not recognize that they have a choice:
• Do something new and do not run with the pack.
• Collaborate with meaningful people.
• Be guided by beauty. It is a beautiful thing to solve problems and do
things right.
• Do not give up.
• Hope for some good luck.2

Wisdom If You Want to Live Big:
You have to wake up every day with a deep desire to be successful. You
cannot just wake up and say, “Hey, I’m going to give a little bit of effort
today and see what happens.” What, are you going to say when you fail,
“I tried” and complain to your wife or girlfriend if it does not work out.3
• • •
“You can do anything in life; you just can’t do everything.” That’s what
Bacon meant when he said, “A wife and children were hostages to for-
tune.” If you put them first, you probably won’t run the three-and-a-
half-minute mile, make your first $10 million, write the great American
novel, or go around the world on a motorcycle. Such goals take 
complete dedication.4
• • •
Those who dare not simply exist. They do not live.5
• • •
You are much better off going into the market on a shoestring feeling
that you cannot afford to lose. I would rather bet on somebody starting
out with a few thousand dollars than on somebody who came in with 
millions.6
• • •
Most little gambles are made without any thought and may certainly 
be trivial. “Do I tie my shoes?” Seems to offer no big risk, nor any big
reward. While others, such as a wildly careening bus coming toward you
could have a far greater impact. However, if deciding not to tie your 
shoes causes you to trip and fall down in the middle of the road and 
that careening bus comes ripping at you, well then, in hindsight the 
trivial has suddenly become paramount.7
• • •
Be a big thinker. Be on fire. Live your imagination. Bet the farm. Do 
not take no for an answer. Turn reality into fantasy. Live your life with 
purpose.8
• • •
Rich and powerful people are not notably talented, educated, charming,
or good-looking. They became rich and powerful by wanting to be rich
and powerful. Your vision of where or who you want to be is the 
greatest asset you have. Without a goal it is impossible to score.9

When you really believe 
that trading is simply a
probability game, concepts 
like right and wrong or 
win and lose no longer have 
the same significance.1

Decide Now
Even if you knew the results of 10,000 roulette spins, what materials the
roulette wheel was made of, and whatever hundred other pieces of informa-
tion you could dream up as possibly being useful, you still would not know
what really mattered: where the ball will land next.2
Similarly, flip a coin 10,000 times. What are the odds it will land on heads
on the 10,001st flip? The odds are exactly 50 percent. Do you actually need
to flip the coin 10,000 times to prove those odds? 
If you put trend following into
a baseball analogy you would ask:
Do you want to play ball or do you
not want to play ball? The pitch is
coming across the plate. Decide
now whether you will swing the
bat. When the pitch comes, if it is
your pitch, swing the bat. You
want to wait for more information
before you swing? No time. In an
uncertain world, if you wait until
the data is clear or until the ball
has crossed the plate, you will miss
the pitch.
In almost every competitive field, it has often been assumed that the best
decision makers have the time and ability to process vast amounts of infor-
mation. However, that is not true—time is always scarce. The principle of a
fast and frugal heuristic is about using the minimum amount of time, knowl-
edge, and computation to make adaptive choices in real life.4
Smart decision makers have learned to use a single piece of information
to make tough decisions.5 If you reflect, consider your options and alterna-
tives, or try to second-guess yourself, you might end up making the wrong
decision or even the right decision, but only after taking perhaps too much
valuable time to get there.
Consider the simple act of catching a baseball. (Yes, I played some base-
ball.) It may seem that you would have to solve complex differential equa-
tions in your heads to predict the trajectory of a ball to catch it. In reality,
Luck is largely responsible for
my reputation for genius. 
I don’t walk into the office in
the morning and say, 
“Am I smart today?” 
I walk in and wonder, 
“Am I lucky today?”3

you simply use a heuristic. For example, when a ball comes in high, you fix-
ate on the ball and start running to it. You ignore the ball’s initial velocity,
distance, and angle, and focus on one piece of information, the angle of your
gaze needed to catch it.6
Think about the markets. You wake up and see a market move enough
to cause you to take action. If your rule says buy at price level 20, you do it.
If you want to win, you execute the entry signal as prescribed. What do you
want? Do you want fantasy, fun, excitement, and a lottery-like existence? Or
do you want to execute correctly and win as a trend following trader by mak-
ing your buy and sell decisions based on a single piece of information…the
simple recognition heuristic of price.
Do not believe in anything 
simply because you heard it. 
Do not believe in anything 
simply because it is rumored by
many. Do not believe in 
anything simply because it is
found written in your religious
books. Do not believe in 
anything merely on the 
authority of your teachers and
elders. Do not believe in 
traditions because they have
been handed down for many
generations. But after 
observation and analysis, when
you find that anything agrees
with reason and is conducive to
the good and benefit of one
and all, then accept it and 
live up to it.7

Our approach to markets is a 
science. It is an unpublished 
science, but it is a real one.
You would have thick leather-bound 
volumes of papers on it if there were a 
willingness to “open the kimono,”
as the horrible modern expression has it.
The process of trading our system is like
repeatedly drawing different colored balls
from the statistician’s apocryphal bag.
As we draw out a ball it becomes part of
the track record, and we put it back in 
the bag, but there is no guarantee that the
balls will come out in the same order 
in the future.1

Science
“Do you have a clear sense of probabilities and payoffs?”
Did you answer “no?” If so, you need to figure it out, and fast.
For example, trader Jim Simons (arguably a closeted trend trader—he
does not identify as one), worth about $8.5 billion, has said that the advan-
tage scientists brought to the trading table was not their computing or math
skills, but their ability to think scientifically. That means the scientific method
is in play:
1. Define the question/theory.
2. Gather information and resources (observe).
3. Form hypothesis.
4. Perform experiment and collect data.
5. Analyze data.
6. Interpret data and draw conclusions that
serve as a starting point for new hypothesis.
7. Publish results.
8. Retest (frequently done by other scientists).
Sometimes scientists employed by trend trading firms are astrophysicists.
Why? Astrophysics is an observational science. You have to learn by study-
ing what is there. You cannot create an experimental solar system in the 
laboratory.2
For example, take a stock, multiply the number of firm employees by the
sales, then divide by the dividend and subtract the CEO’s age and you get a
number. But so what? Just because you can compute that number does 
not make that number useful for 
anything. Scientific thinking immedi-
ately sees the logical errors.3
Being wrong is part of the trend
following life. Many just cannot wrap
their head around that.4 Bottom line,
there are scientifically established
principles of market behavior that
you can observe and use for profit.
As Ripley said, “Believe it, or not!”
Understanding
trend trading is 
like crime scene
investigation (CSI).
Trend followers essentially 
operate scientific research labs.
Their research materials are
financial data. 
The financial markets are their
laboratory.

Statistical Thinking
Trend following is about non-normality of market returns. You will never
have, nor will you ever, produce returns that exhibit a normal distribution.
You will never produce the mythologically consistent returns that many
believe to exist.
When trend followers hit
home runs from the likes of
Barings Bank, Long-Term Capital
Management, and the 2008 mar-
ket crash, they are targeting
unknowable extreme occurrences
that happen to occur with a prob-
ability greater than expected.
Those occurrences are fat tails—in statistician speak. Trend following’s
nature of riding a trend to the end when it bends, and then cutting losses very
fast, puts you in a position to benefit when the next unexpected flood 
rolls in.
Trend following’s alpha comes from letting
winners run on the right-hand side of a fat tail
and cutting losses short on the left-hand side.
Eliminating losing positions and holding onto
profitable positions puts you in the big game
hunt for positive outliers.3 A normal distribution
is simply worse than useless as a risk management
tool.4
The Sharpe ratio is oversold. 
It can give a false sense of 
precision and lead people to
make predictions unwisely.2
Trend followers
exhibit a positive
skew return profile.

Statistical Thinking
139
Look back at the chapter “Show Me the Money.” Trend following
returns don’t come close to exhibiting the consistency of Pujols’ career sta-
tististics. You won’t have trend following batting statistics that ever match
Pujols’ year in year out steadiness, but that is ok.
I acknowledge that consistency is a temptress—even for the highly edu-
cated and affluent. An associate of mine, an accomplished businessman, and I
recently had lunch. He knew some about my career, but not much. During our
conversation he mentioned that he was recently caught up in a very well-known
hedge fund scam (not Madoff). I asked him quickly, before he could explain
much, if his returns were positive every month. He replied, “Every month.”
Later, I Googled him and found out that he had lost several million.
However, thinking in terms of statistics is more than just measuring where on
the bell curve trend traders find their inconsistent profits. For example, I
want you to look at statistics from an alternative perspective.
Imagine there are two hospitals. In the first, 120 babies are born every
day. In the second, 12 babies are born every day. On average, the ratio of
boys to girls is 50/50. On a given day, in one of the two hospitals, twice as
many girls are born as boys. Which hospital was it more likely to happen in?
The likelihood is higher in the smaller hospital. Why? Because the probabil-
ity of a random deviation from the population mean decreases with an
increase in sample size.6
Take two traders who win 40 percent of the time with their winners
being three times as large as their losers. One has a history of 1,000 trades
and the other has a history of 10 trades. Who has a better chance in the next
10 trades to have only 10 percent of their total trades end up winners instead
of the typical 40 percent? The one with the 10-trade history has the better
chance. Why? The more trades in a history, the greater the probability of
averages holding true. The fewer trades, the greater the probability of mov-
ing away from the average.
Consider a friend who receives a stock tip, makes some quick money, and
tells everyone about it. There is a big problem with this scenario. His popu-
lation of winning tips is extremely small—one to be exact. That’s statistically
insignificant. He could just as easily follow his next hot tip and lose all of his
money. One tip means nothing. The sample is essentially anecdotal evidence.

Thinking in terms of statistics is everywhere if you are observant. During
a Monday Night Football game, one of the announcers, Ron Jaworski, put
numbers and odds in perspective for playing the game of football: “Play call-
ing is about probability, not certainty.”
It is the same in trend following trading.
All else being equal, you want
strategies with the most positive
skew and the most negative
excess kurtosis. These would 
be strategies with the fewest
occurrences of large 
negative returns.7

Aha!
Finding the truth takes time, energy, and many Aha! moments. Figuring it
out is very similar to taking a jolt of electricity to the brain (not that I have
done that exactly!).
One of those awakenings for me occurred upon learning about the exis-
tence of a documentary from the late 1980s that profiled trader Paul Tudor
Jones. Jones is now worth $3.3 billion—so evidence of his early trading days
was welcomed.2
My intuition said that this out-of-circulation documentary was going to
deliver the unexpected, but it was extremely tough to locate. Amazon, eBay,
and most other obvious venues were dead ends. When I finally found it
through ‘channels,’ my gut was dead on.
The March 1987 documentary Trader was made when Jones was 32
years old with just 22 employees in his firm. Today, his firm has 300 employ-
ees and more than $10 billion under management. The documentary was all
raw passsion. Jones and Peter Borish, his second in command at the time,
were in the middle of a game with one simple goal: Get very rich. Borish
knew there were no shortcuts: “I am graded instantly through the harshest
teacher in the world—the market. There is no curve. I can’t say, ‘Boy, I was
out late last night and everybody else in the class was at a pep rally for the
football game and I only got a 70, but that was the highest in the class, so I
still got an A.’ It doesn’t work that way in the market.”3
Jones was living that nonexistent grade curve. In one scene at his
Chesapeake Bay home, you could hear it in his voice as he described playing
at the highest level: “Whether you are making 100% rate of return on
$10,000 or $100,000,000, it doesn’t make any difference. Right? If you
complete 78 percent of your passes, it would be nice to be in the NFL. [But]
if you are in college, high school, or elementary school, I am sure the thrill
[of winning] is just as great.”4
Later in the film, Jones reflects about his first boss, a famed cotton spec-
ulator named Eli Tullis: “The first year I did nothing but get his coffee. I was
learning by osmosis. I was a glorified secretary, which is fine because I was
soaking in everything, every move that he made and every step that he
took.”5

Trend Commandments
144
Jones was especially fond of one memorable experience with Tullis: “He
sat there right in the middle of getting absolutely decimated across the board
in these commodities with the most beautiful smile, the most incredibly ele-
gant poise and stylish composure and just had a wonderful little chat with me
for 45 minutes to an hour. I was just overwhelmed that anyone could be that
strong.”6
Tullis’s poise under pressure changed Jones’s
perspective. It both inspired and taught him a
priceless lesson. If you want to end up with a
nonaverage net worth, a “learn from someone
else” attitude is paramount. Putting your ego
aside and admitting that you don’t know it all
isn’t easy, but it is the mindset of true winners. 
Dare to be rare.
Numbers don’t lie.
You are either in
the black or 
you are not.

Hero Worship
I could not write this book without chapters outlining what trend following
acceptance is up against. In the world of financial media—it is a full court
press for your attention (read: your dollars). Yet it always strikes me very odd
to see people worshipping random financial dogma or slick talking market
gurus. Thinking about that brought back a memory from the now classic ani-
mated TV series King of the Hill, especially since I know of names in the
financial world just like this story (drugs and all).
In one episode, a washed-up former Dallas Cowboys football player
moves into Hank Hill’s neighborhood. This former Cowboy was never very
good during his career, but to weekend warriors like Hank and his buddies,
it did not matter in the least. He was a former pro football player—he was a
god to be worshipped. That is until they found out the real story of Big
Willie:
Big Willie: Hey, you guys wanna see some stuff from my career? It’s
the football from that kick I blocked. Oh, and here’s a picture from
that kick I blocked… and that’s how I blocked that kick.
Hank: That story gets better every time you tell it.
But later, as Hank’s son Bobby notes, Big Willie is not that impres-
sive a football legend.
Bobby: You know, for a guy who was a pro athlete, Willie’s drunk a
lot.2
Many see market gurus as religious prophets. When TV zombies say it’s
time to buy Google or dump Las Vegas Sands, many follow random advice
blindly—mostly because of the name fame factor. Do you actually know any-
thing real about these people? Or could they just be cartoons like Big Willie?
If fame is a factor in your market choices—honk the horn and yell,
“Booyah!”
So why do people listen to talking heads making predictions all day long?
Are they thinking, “Maybe he will help me make millions in the stock mar-
ket?“ Or is it, “Maybe he’s right in his Google timing, and I can make a
killing right now?” Or is it really, “He’s on TV; he has to be right!”

Think of it this way: A guru comes on and says buy Gold. Isn’t he say-

he says buy, Gold will go up forever and you’ll never need to sell?

There is a room on Wall Street

On the right side there is

After all, investors are always

Any reason will do.1

Buy and Hope
Cosmetic and financial services are strikingly similar. They both sell hope. For
instance, after the stock market bubble burst in spring 2000 and after the
crash of October 2008, the concept of buy and hold as a strategy should have
died a stake-to-the-heart death. Despite everything that should have been
learned, most still follow this strategy.
Stay the course. Buy the dips. Never surrender…. Buy and hold mantras are
junk science because you never answer the basic questions: “Buy how much
of what?” “Buy at what price?” “Hold for how long?”
Consider the Nasdaq market crash of 1973–1974. The Nasdaq reached
its high peak in December 1972. It then dropped by nearly 60 percent, hit-
ting rock bottom in September 1974. The Nasdaq did not break free of the
1973–1974 bear market until April 1980. Buy and hold did nothing from
December 1972 through March 1980. Your golden years happened during
the 1970s—tough luck. You would have made more money during this
period in a 3-percent savings account. Of course, history repeated itself with
the more recent 70+ percent drop in the Nasdaq from 2000–2009.
The buy and hold investor has been led to
believe, by an industry with a powerful conflict of
interest, that if you have tremendous patience
and discipline and stick with it, you will make
money. But you need to understand that you can
go ten, and even twenty years, making no return
at all, or even lose huge.
To compound problems even more, buy and
holders often fall prey to a form of market
revenge. You bought, then you lost, and now you want your money back.
You think, “I lost my money in MSFT, and I’m going to make my money
back in MSFT come hell or high water. I will just hold on!” Not wise.
The examples do not stop. The Japanese Nikkei 225 stock index reached
nearly 40,000 in 1989. Now, 22 years later, it is around 10,000. Do you
think the Japanese still believe in buy and hold?
Even a dead cat will

• In 2016, Social Security benefits will exceed tax collections.
• At their peak, 46 percent of working Americans were covered by a pen-
sion plan. By 2005, it had declined to 17 percent.
• The Fed has reduced interest rates to 0—killing everyone with a savings
or money market account.
• The Dow closed at 381.17 on September 3, 1929. The Dow closed
above 381 on 11/23/1954—25 years after the 1929 high.2
Those numbers are not pretty. That said, investors have short and selec-
tive memories. If the market advances from a low point to any significant
degree upward, buy and hold feels comfortable again. It can feel like market
bubbles are a thing of the past—especially when so many talking heads are
preaching recovery.

No one knows if there is a current bubble in stocks, but it is amazing that
some people think they know. I had a conversation with a friend recently. He
mentioned that real estate in Southern California was stabilizing (forget that
debate for a moment), and then the conversation of bubbles came up. He
quickly announced that we were not in a stock market bubble. I was amazed
at his confidence. Has there ever been a time when the majority knew they
were in the middle of a bubble? Bubbles are never clear until the dust settles.
One critic proffered:
“Momentum works about 
80 percent of the time.”3 Where
does that statistic come from?
How does one define 
“momentum”? What happens
the other 20 percent of the
time? Do you go bankrupt? 
Do you lose half your money?
How do you define “of the
time”? Do you make money
eight out of ten years? Months?
Weeks? The fact that a critic
starts with a fabricated 
statistic should ring alarm bells
immediately.

You got to know when 
to hold ’em, know when to fold ’em,
know when to walk away 
and know when to run.
You never count your money

for countin’ when the

Over the years, my firm’s trend following research work has put me in con-
tact with thousands of investors and traders spread across more than 100 
countries. That was never expected with the simple launch of a five-page web 
site in late 1996 titled TurtleTrader.com®. Back then I paid a 22-year old 
programmer $4,000 for that bit of web design. He quickly disappeared back 
to Russia, and I became a self-taught HTML coder.
Today, out of that humble beginning, there is no one type of person who 
reaches out for trend trading insight. Readers and clients include men and 
women, young and old, from college students to billion-dollar hedge funds. 
My sites have become a central clearing for all that is systematic trend follow-
ing trading.
One of the most interesting aspects of spreading this gospel is conver-
sion. People who once viewed trading one way, but who were influenced to 
change via my work. An example? A new client signed on recently. He has a 
very popular national radio show and has been working with private clients 
for decades. His specialty? Putting his clients’ money to work using funda-
mental analysis. How much trend trading experience did he have prior to my 
books? None that I am aware. My research firm helped him to move in the 
right direction, but that was not what especially struck me in this case.
He was very open in telling me why he became a client. There was one 
basic reason: After the market bottomed in Spring 2009, he saw no funda-
mental reason for equity markets to trend up, but they did. He decided at 
that moment, and in the context of seeing my books, that he needed new 
tools to deal with that clear discrepancy as soon as possible.
Our conversation and exchanges were inspir-
ing. After decades of providing a service to his 
clients, he knew something was wrong. He 
understood that he had to make an adjustment in 
his business. Not many people do that. Many are 
like the arrogant professors at the University of 
Chicago believing markets are efficient, people 
are rational, and it’s my way or the highway. 
Don’t be like the professors. Be a sponge. Be 
open to the new.

First principles, Clarice:

Of each particular thing ask,
“What is it in itself? 
What is its nature?”1

Oracle of Omaha
Warren Buffett has achieved his Holy Grail, and his success is severely saluted.
But, can you achieve what he has done? Doubtful. He is the unobtainable
exception to every rule.
Buffett is complex with a complex firm. He has been positioned as the
buy and hold/value guy and has not done much to counter that view, but it
is dead wrong. Buffett has traded serious size in currencies. Many times he
has bet against the dollar. There is nothing wrong with that, but the thou-
sands who attend his annual shareholder meetings do not know that, that is
part of the real legend.
Buffett has also traded derivatives, but at one time he was once squarely
against derivatives: “We have more money than ideas…one place the money
certainly won’t go is to derivatives. There’s no place with as much potential
for phony numbers as derivatives.”2
His billionaire vice chairman, Charlie Munger, added: “To say that deriv-
ative accounting is a sewer is an insult to sewage.”3 Shortly after those state-
ments, Buffet’s firm sold $400 million of a new type of derivative security in
a private placement to qualified institutional investors.4
To confound even more, a year later Buffett declared: “Derivatives are
financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers, while now latent,
[but] potentially lethal. We view them as time bombs, both for the parties
that deal in them and the economic system.”5
Buffett’s legend of buy and hold or value as his get-rich strategy has per-
meated public consciousness thoroughly for decades. Dozens of books spin
the yarn. Yet when he launches a new derivatives strategy against his legend,
either no one notices or those who do notice refuse to criticize. (That might
hurt business, after all.)
A few years back, I sat down with a trend following trader. He has a 20-
year plus track record making on average more than 20 percent a year. The
topic of Warren Buffett came up during our discussion. While he was very
respectful of Buffett, he was bewildered how some could call his trend fol-
lowing trading luck, but those same people could see Buffett as skill.
This same trader pointed out the thousands of trades he has made. He
noted that his trend trading peers also had thousands of trades over decades.
He saw it more logical to make an argument for Buffett’s success as luck
given the relatively few trades that made him so wealthy: Coke, Gillette,
American Express, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo to name a few.

In addition to the billions in options he wrote (more derivatives),
Buffett’s own portfolio and insurance business were arguably at the heart of
the Great Recession. It may be a stretch to say that the solvency of Berkshire
was at risk in the fall of 2008, but just imagine how things would have
unfolded if Goldman Sachs had failed. The dominoes in Buffett’s portfolio
and behind Berkshire would have tumbled quickly.6
A few years later, in 2011, Buffett was in India warning investors to avoid
“long-term fixed-dollar investments” such as 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds.
He worried that government actions were combining to dilute the value of
the dollar. Buffett warned: “If you ask me, if the U.S. Dollar is going to hold
its purchasing power fully at the level of 2011, 5 years, 10 years, or 20 years
from now, I would tell you it will not.” Does that mean Buffett has been sell-
ing bonds? You bet. Amazingly, government actions he now critiques are the
very ones that saved him.7
However, Buffett sees it differently. He reflected on the chaotic times
since 2008: “[My techniques] are not new lessons. Never owe any money
you can’t pay tomorrow morning. Never let the markets dictate your actions.
Always be in a position to play your own game. Never take on more risks than
you can handle. But all of those were old lessons, unfortunately. Even though
I didn’t see it coming, those lessons which are timeless allowed us to in effect
profit from it rather than suffer from it. Good businesses, good management,
plenty of liquidity, always having a loaded gun; if you play by those princi-
ples, you will do fine no matter what happens. And you don’t ever know
what’s going to happen.”8
It’s almost as if Buffett has become Jason Bourne—an amnesiac on the
loose—without memory of how history has really unfolded. Add in his
Goldman Sachs association and the David Sokol situation, a top executive of
his who resigned under odd circumstances resembling insider trading, and in
total over the last decade Buffett as the avuncular straight talker has become
harder and harder to accept at face value. Long-time fund manager Michael
Steinhardt was harsher: “[Buffett’s] reality is that he is the greatest PR per-
son of recent times. And he has managed to achieve a snow job that has
conned virtually everyone in the press to my knowledge…and [it] is remark-
able that he continues to do it.”9
As someone who grew up in the Washington D.C. area, I watched politi-
cians use and/or abuse the system to their own economic advantage on such
a regular basis that it was no longer considered
unethical. In the fall of 2008, Buffet received
political favors and influenced government in
ways that no trend following trader ever could. It
was wrong. Buying into the Buffet legend is not
part of my ethos.
Don’t drink the
Kool-Aid.

A Seinfeld Moment
The line between entertainment and today’s financial journalism is very
murky. First, consider an instantly recognizable passage for many comedy
fans:
NBC Executive: I just wanted to let you know that we’ve been dis-
cussing you at some of our meetings and we’d be very interested in
doing something.
Jerry: Really? Wow.
NBC Executive: If you have any idea for a TV show for yourself, well,
we’d just love to talk about it.
Jerry: I’d be very interested in something like that.
NBC Executive: Well, why don’t you give us a call and maybe we can
develop a series.
Jerry: Okay. Great. Thanks.
George returns.
George: What was that all about?
Jerry: They said they were interested in me.
George: For what?
Jerry: A TV show.
George: Your own show?
Later Jerry and George are talking.
Jerry: Well, what’s our new show idea going to be about?
George: It’s about nothing.
Jerry: No story?
George: No, forget the story.
Jerry: You’ve got to have a story.
A little later.
Jerry: And it’s about nothing?
George: Absolutely nothing.
Jerry: So you’re saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea
for a show about nothing?

CNBC once invited me to
their offices. They paid my travel.
I had no specific knowledge of
what they wanted, but the meet-
ing was with producer Susan
Krakower who had invented Jim
Cramer’s show. It was assumed
that they were looking for new
content. Once there, the meeting
was in a small windowless New Jersey office with Krakower and her two lieu-
tenants. It was like when Jerry and George went to meet with NBC. A Jim
Cramer poster hung behind her.
Krakower sat in front of me behind a large desk and her two lieutenants
flanked me on either side. It was triangulation so to speak. They peppered me
with small talk questions, yet seemed to have no clue about my writings,
research, or thinking. They had not read my books. They only had a picture
of me that I had not seen before (something you might imagine an actor
brings to a Hollywood casting call). This was the epicenter of CNBC’s con-
tent development: A glossy headshot.
Krakower asked me to hypothetically program ten hours of airtime for
CNBC. My idea for new programming was blunt: trend following, not more
stories. My ability to play the game was not very good, and it was easy to see
that candor was taken as an insult. The conversation bounced around for 30
minutes and—surprise, surprise—there was no further dialogue.
Walking through the halls of CNBC’s studios that day reminded me of
The Truman Show: a constructed reality, a staged, scripted TV show. Except
instead of it being one person (Jim Carrey’s character in The Truman Show)
who does not know reality is fake, CNBC’s reality plays to a worldwide audi-
ence daily, week after week and year after year. Views like that make me a per-
sona non grata with some.
Once after speaking to an audience of nearly 1,000 in Brazil, and after
the audience had just listened to me proselytize (come on, I got to play the
title of this book up some!) about the negatives of media and press, the
barbed wire question was thrown to rip me a new one: 
“How are you different than Jim Cramer?”
Now that question came after an hour of talking about trend following
in depth in the context of the 2008 market crash as trend followers cleaned
up. But still, it was a great question to explain further. It comes down to fun-
damentals versus trend following. If you watch Cramer, you always have to

tune in to stay current—that is the hook. That is not the trend following
process. It is not my process. Once you know the trend trading way, you do
not need anyone to hold your hand to cross the street. That’s a big differ-
ence. Although, teaching as many people as possible is my goal, and capital-
ism courses through my veins, comparisons to Cramer do not equate.
My logic does not win everyone over. One reader complained: “You
trash CNBC and other people, but they provide very good information if you
know how to use it, and you shouldn’t just trash everybody’s point of view
because there are a lot of smarter people than you who have a better opin-
ion.”
Punch harder please. Really get some shoulder into it if you are going to
swing at me. 
Let Federal government and
mass media do what they do,

Snow Job
After a presentation at the Traders Expo in Las Vegas, an investor approached
me. He wanted to explain his belief that he could trade for profit based on
his gut feel, using his intuition as his sole decision-making criteria. I immedi-
ately envisioned him sitting in his big easy chair staring into space deciding
how his tummy felt. He mentioned a recent book that touted his belief, but
otherwise he had no objective proof. 
I said, “Please provide one legitimate performance record based on your
type of decision-making? Just one will do.” Spoiler alert: There is not one.
That does not stop the
prophets though. Consider an
end-of-the-world announcement
put out November 10, 2010, by
one guru:
“This is one of those intu-
itions… We might even see
a test of the post-crash lows
of [S&P] 670 again before
the market comes back. If
any of you have a lot of money in the stock market, I’d suggest that
now is a very good time to go to cash. 100% cash. If I were you I’d
sell everything in my 401K etc. Sell mutual funds, individual stocks
etc. The market is ripe for a correction and it could get ugly again. My
intuition tells me that it could get worse than we’ve seen in recent
memory. I don’t generally make predictions and this isn’t a prediction
exactly as the price could certainly go higher.”
It is the end of the world, but markets could go higher. Bottom line, flip-
ping coins is not how people accumulate wealth. A month later, this same
individual was asked about his prediction not working. He tried to save face:
“I think the markets are in for another series of problems, which will
manifest sometime in the next week to five years, but the market
action is neutral at this exact moment.”
It used to be that someone
could declare a positive return
was their brilliance, 
rather than just the general 
rise of the broad market. 
Now you can tell the truth.

Next week to five years. That’s his call?
Bullsh** just baffles brains. When you talk bullsh**, it’s like you’ve
thrown a baseball at someone. It is up to them to consider what you’ve said;
i.e. to catch the ball. It is up to them to understand or respond. If your words
consist of big meaningless words, which take people time to understand, then
you’ve achieved your goal. Most do not want to appear foolish and will hap-
pily nod and agree just so it appears that they’ve understood to avoid any
embarrassment (tip to madbot.org).
It gets more entertaining. Peter Popoff is an odd-looking fellow who I
first saw while flipping channels. He is a German televangelist who preaches
money to primarily African-American audiences in the American South. His
videos are outrageous—lots of hands on the foreheads and supposed miracles
of debt relief along with instant riches in the form of checks that just arrive
in the mail.
Popoff and his brethren, because there is more than one that’s for sure,
are selling Jesus-based get-rich-quick and get-out-of-debt schemes to thou-
sands. It’s also the mainstream televangelists like Pat Robertson. He
announced that “the Lord” had told him that there was going to be a major
stock market crash in 2009 or 2010—a prediction that did not pan out.
It does not stop with preachers. Even the big-name celebrities are in on
moving sheep from point A to point B:
H & H Imports Inc. surged higher after rapper 50 Cent told his fans
on Twitter to buy the stock that sells his new sunglasses: “HNHI is

Twit Me a River
Twitter, chat rooms, message boards, e-mails from guys selling get rich fast—
the desire to convince someone else of something—never ends. Twitter, how-
ever, is the one social media app that fascinates me. It is very cool
conceptually. What a great way to reach people, to get a message out, and
quick.
However, how can millions of tipsters and tweets bring actionable and
credible advice on making money to you on a daily basis? They can’t. It’s too
much information. It’s not the most important information, either (remem-
ber price?). One inventive fellow, attempting to base his hedge fund around
tweets, tossed this gem out: 
“If you can do this it gives you a massive edge on the market as you
know the mood.” The principle lies in analyzing the 120 million
tweets, which are posted daily by the 180 million-strong Twitter
members and looking for mood states. Using an algorithm which
works in real time, it divides the information into six mood states—
anxious, calm, and sad for example—giving them an overall reflection
of how the world is feeling.1
Of course, this type of silly
talk is not new. People have been
leading and misleading each other
since the dawn of time. You jump
into that game, you get what you
get, win or lose.
The government, not surpris-
ingly due to their infinite caring,
always want to help those who
lose, even if they lose fairly due to
their own choice or ignorance. How did the government recently try to fix
the problem of losing? The SEC actually supported a new and improved ban
of the spreading of false and misleading information about companies.
Former SEC Chairman Christopher Cox said he wanted to ensure that
investors could continue to get reliable, accurate information about public
companies in the marketplace.

Nonsense. That protection already exists—it is called the market price.
You cannot fake that.
I am not entirely certain how misleading can be clearly defined. But, sup-
pose some knucklehead wants to spin misleading information on a chat
board. And, then an even bigger knucklehead chooses to believe this infor-
mation and act on it. That is a marriage made in heaven, not an opportunity
for the federal government to step in and create more jobs—or what they call
regulation.
In chat rooms, anonymity fuels a
liar’s sense of invincibility, and
his statements are often so bold
and outrageous it’s amazing
anyone takes it seriously. Yet
there is no shortage of individu-
als ready to look for new confi-
dants among the shadowy
charlatans of the Internet.2

Goldline
You have surely heard the Goldline.com commercials on TV and radio (or
similar gold hype). They will sell you gold because it is the greatest invest-
ment since the dawn of time, and the world is about to fall into complete hel-
ter-skelter. Prepare!
Here are my instructions to you. Call Goldline.com. Ask one of their
salesmen the simple question: “If I buy gold, when do I ever sell gold?”
I have done it. Their answer is pure comedy. A 20-something bright-eyed
salespeople responded to me: “Gold has never crashed.” He added: “If gold
was to go again from $800 to $200 you would have plenty of warning to
sell.” “Who was going to give me that warning?” I asked. He said, drum roll
please: “They would.”
Everyone should call and have that conversation. Block your number and
only give your first name. Ask them the same questions and don’t give any
personal details. Ordinary people, the backbone of every economy, require
encouragement and reassurance, not doomsday theories. Goldline.com is
selling Judgement Day fear. It’s bogus.
Oh, I forgot. Goldline.com is not selling you the actual gold, or gold
futures contracts, or gold ETFs. They are selling you gold coins—often
marked up by a huge margin of the actual melt value of the coins. However,
I don’t want the government telling Goldline that it is illegal to sell gold
coins at a crazy premium to inept
investors. We have enough busy-
body regulations. However, I have
no problem making sure my read-
ers see through this dog-and-pony
show.
Do trend followers trade
gold? Absolutely. When it is going
up, they are long. When it is going
down, they are short. They follow

because the Mayan calendar is pre-

in 2012, you can’t take your coins

Some attack trend following:
“Trend Following is one of the
stock market’s biggest cons; 
I would even go so far to 
compare the concept to a cult,
like Scientology. 
I get the same sort of value 
from Trend Following as I do
from supernatural operators 
such as Uri Geller and 
horoscope readers.”2

Maria Bartiromo circa 2001: 
“I am of the belief that the 
individual out there is actually not
throwing money at things that they
do not understand, and is actually
using the news and using the 
information out there to make 
smart investment decisions.”1

Intoxication
A bipolar prediction came across my desk recently: “If the market rises over
the next several weeks, today will have been a good day to buy. However, no
one can know the answer today. Every day there seems to be a surprise. We
don’t know how to predict the behavior of foreign countries or their
attacks.”
The nonsense doesn’t stop there. While on the East Coast recently, I was
listening to an AM radio finance show. An older man called in to ask how he
could buy into various commodity markets. He was worried that they had
run too far already. The female host assured him that there was plenty of time
and to jump into the market. The caller mentioned that he liked to buy low
and was waiting for a pullback. The host told him to start preparing for
hyperinflation. She named an African country to enhance her theory and
leaned the conversation toward food insurance, needed of course for the
coming descent into anarchy.
Think not knowing what you are talking about is new? Think again.
President Herbert Hoover circa May 1930: “While the crash only took place
six months ago, I am convinced we have now passed through the worst—and
with continued unity of effort we shall rapidly recover. There has been no sig-
nificant bank or industrial failure. That danger, too, is safely behind us.”
Can’t just pick on old-timers. Consider the current day. Lloyd Blankfein
(head of Goldman Sachs) said his firm would have survived the credit crisis
without government help. The firm’s president, Gary Cohn, was more defin-
itive: “I think we would not have failed. We had cash.” Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner countered, “None of them would have survived” without
government help.2
More contradicting rhetoric from a 2010 60 Minutes interview rein-
forces the propaganda spell cast:
Scott Pelley: “Is keeping inflation in check less of a priority for the
Federal Reserve now?”
Ben Bernanke: “No, absolutely not. What we’re trying to do is
achieve a balance. We’ve been very, very clear that we will not allow
inflation to rise above two percent or less.”
Pelley: “Can you act quickly enough to prevent inflation from getting
out of control?”

Trend Commandments

Bernanke: “We could raise interest rates in 15 minutes if we have to.
So, there really is no problem with raising rates, tightening monetary
policy, slowing the economy, reducing inflation, at the appropriate
time. Now, that time is not now.”
Pelley: “You have what degree of confidence in your ability to control
this?”
Bernanke: “One hundred percent.”3
That confidence seems misplaced when you consider Bernanke’s words
but a few years before:
In 2005, Bernanke said: “We’ve never had a decline in house prices on a
nationwide basis. So, what I think is more likely is that house prices will slow,
maybe stabilize, might slow consumption spending a bit. I don’t think it’s
going to drive the economy too far from its full employment path, though.”4
In 2006, Bernanke said: “Housing markets are cooling a bit. Our expec-
tation is that the decline in activity or the slowing in activity will be moder-
ate, that house prices will probably continue to rise.”5
In 2007, Bernanke stated: “At this juncture…the impact on the broader
economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime markets
seems likely to be contained.”6
Worse yet? Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee in March 2011
that he saw “little evidence” that the stock market was a bubble, but provided
certainty with this ditty of a
response: “Of course, nobody can
know for sure.” Why again do we
care what this man says?
But before Bernanke, Alan
Greenspan was also laying the
groundwork. 
From 
recently
released 2005 documents comes
former Atlanta Federal Reserve
President Jack Guynn:
“Nearly every major city in Florida has experienced increases in the
double-digit range, and some, like Miami, Palm Beach, Sarasota, and
West Palm, have been reporting increases in housing prices on a year-
over-year basis of between 25 and 30 percent. I’m reasonably comfort-
able characterizing the housing feeding frenzy in some of our markets
as being a bubble or a near bubble. The ugly picture we have seen
before—and that they think we may very likely see again before long—
goes something like this: The drying up of sales of new units; the
We inhabit a complex 
system that has virtually nothing
to do with the neoclassical
model taught in Econ 101. 
That’s why economists failed to

painful decision of developers to go ahead and complete the construc-
tion of additional units to make them saleable, further depressing the
market; and speculators who had hoped to see big capital gains walk-
ing away or defaulting on their contracts, giving their properties back
to the lender. Perhaps it’s because of where I sit, but I am less com-
forted than some of my colleagues about the housing situation.”
Former Chairman Greenspan responded:
“Let’s take a break for coffee.”8
Six years later, in 2011, Alan Greenspan declared:
“I conclude that the current government activism is hampering what
should be a broad-based robust economic recovery, driven in signifi-
cant part by the positive wealth effect of a buoyant U.S. and global

The media are right there too.
During production, my documen-
tary film arranged for an interview
with CNBC’s Maria Bartiromo.
The interview was approved for months. Other interviews for the film
included two Nobel Prize winners, and several legendary hedge fund man-
agers. Bartiromo canceled minutes before her interview. She left a voicemail
message:
“I probably should not have said yes to it without having this stuff go
through my, uhhh, PR people. I’m sorry about that, but, ah, given
what’s gone on and all the criticism of analysts and the, you know, the
Dot-com boom and bust I…I can’t, um, I…I don’t want to really do
this open ended without really knowing more details.”
Bartiromo is a media professional who has interviewed world leaders and
top financial experts for more than a decade. However, almost eight years
after the Dot-com bubble, Bartiromo was using it as a reason to not go 
on the record about the role media plays on Wall Street. That voicemail 
confirmed my experiences at CNBC earlier in the year. When they walk off
the set, it is just that—a set.
It took Greenspan. 
It took zero interest rates. 
It took an amazing repackaging
of mortgage instruments. It took 
people begging other people to
take equity out of their house to
buy another one in Florida.10

One reader was not happy with my revelations: “You make accusations
without any proof or examples. You are media and just as guilty as those you
accuse. This is a hatchet piece without merit. You apparently have an audi-
ence that hates America, CNBC, and Maria. Glad I don’t have to live in your
[—-]hole.”
It all comes down to propaganda and the battle against it. Anyone famil-
iar with the inner workings of a Tupperware party knows all about the power
of influence, and how very well it
works.11
Most info-Web-media-news-

Removing junk is just as much a

concepts and rules of systematic
trend following trading.

Parliament of Whores
Social Security is dead? Easier said than done.
On Meet the Press in 2010, one United States governor appeared con-
fused: “If you care about democracy and what the everyday citizen believes,
and you want to empower them, they don’t want the Social Security system
to be dismantled, and they don’t want the Medicare system to be disman-
tled…this is a compact between generations to be able to make sure that all
of our seniors have the funds when they retire, that they’re not going to be
homeless, so they’re not going to have to go to a shelter.”
Did she know that the inflation adjusted return of Social Security is just
2 percent? A United States Senator on Meet the Press in 2011 apparently did
not: “Social Security is a program that works. It is fully funded for the next
40 years. Stop picking on Social Security. It’s not a crisis. Social Security is
fine.”
Those politicians are not stupid; rather, they have ceased to think. Or, do
they just need to tell a certain story to ensure power for whatever party with
which they are affiliated? Waiting or hoping for your politician, on the right
or the left or anywhere in between, to win an election is an investment strat-
egy of your ignorance.
Behind the scenes and in the halls of Congress; drunks, perverts, and los-
ers addicted to fame and power.
Both sides.
Some history is in order for all those who like to reward and/or blame
politicians. Go back to the first war in Iraq. President Bush Sr. had an 89 per-
cent approval rating on February 28, 1991. Then the economy tanked. His
fault? No. Real estate crashed in the early 1990s, not long after the savings-
and-loan debacle of the late 1980s. What happened next? President William
J. Clinton won the fall 1992 election. However, Clinton’s election did not
signal roaring economic times, and Democrats lost the House and Senate to
Republicans for the first time in 40 years in 1994. Did Clinton sink the econ-
omy in that short time? No.
Then magic happened. During late 1994, the Internet started to roll, and
in August 1995 Netscape went public, a trigger still felt today. Stock markets
boomed during 1995–1999. The Dot-com bubble was on. However, this
bubble was a problem and people knew it. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan uttered the phrase “irrational exuberance” in a December 1996

speech, but simply pointing out a bubble was only so useful. In fact, he was
resoundingly ignored, and even jeered by some in the financial media.
The good times kept rolling. President Clinton had an approval rating of
73 percent on December 19, 1998, six years into his presidency. Did he or
the Republican Congress have anything to do with record tax receipts com-
ing into government coffers? No. The Dot-com bubble was spinning off cash
to everyone. Governments were flush. America was feeling rich.
Party over. The Nasdaq crashed in March 2000. The Fed, knowing the
massive problem on their hands and deathly afraid that the Dow would
deflate, started cutting the Fed Funds rate of over 6 percent on May 16,
2000, to a low of 1 percent in June 2003. If the Dot-com bubble had not
popped in the spring of 2000, would Al Gore have been president? Perhaps,
but the fall of 2000 instead brought another President Bush, George W.
President George W. Bush inherited the Dot-com bubble implosion, and
less than a year into office, 9/11 hit. Two wars of choice followed. However,
Fed rate cutting had already started a new bubble blowing. This time real
estate and the Dow were zooming up. People rewarded Bush for the econ-
omy even though it was the middle of another bubble. His second term
started in January 2005.
All is running smoothly until summer 2007, when the new bubble starts
to deflate. It finally crashes in October 2008, and President Barack Obama
wins the presidency standing at the right place at the right political time. If
the economy had not sunk over 2007–2008, would Republican candidate
John McCain be president? Probably. The economy could crater again, or
not. If it crashes or not, is it all Obama’s fault? No. Are you sitting there still
thinking the president will fix your portfolio?
Further, look at the Fed Funds rate manipulation over the last 20 years:
Fed Funds rate 5.50 percent on November 15, 1994.
Stock market takes off.
Fed Funds rate 4.75 percent on November 17, 1998.
Fed Funds rate 6.50 percent on May 16, 2000.
Stock market bubble popped March 2000.
The Fed then lowers 13 times.
Fed Funds rate 3.00 percent on September 17, 2001.
Fed Funds rate 1.25 percent on November 6, 2002.
Stock market takes off.
Real estate takes back off.
Fed Funds rate 1.00 percent on June 25, 2003.

Parliament of Whores
183
The Fed then raises 17 times.
Fed Funds rate 5.25 percent on August 17, 2007.
The Fed then lowers 10 times.
Stock market bubble popped October 2008.
Fed Funds rate 0 percent on December 16, 2008.
Stock market takes off.
Those examples are all government intervention and manipulation, plain
and simple. In 2010, Brian Sack, a senior official at the New York Fed, admit-
ted the need to keep stock markets artificially high: “Nevertheless, balance
sheet policy can still lower longer-term borrow-
ing costs for many households and businesses,
and it adds to household wealth by keeping asset
prices higher than they otherwise would be.”
The Fed has essentially admitted to operating
a Ponzi scheme.2
Am I saying to not trade?
No.
A 
government-manipulated
market is still a market.
With all of the extracurricular
policy-making of the government
aimed at rigging the markets to
some unknown right level, trend
following is the only sanity avail-
able. There is no telling what the
government will do to push the
stock market to whatever level
they feel is important. Conversely,
just as the government can push the stock market up, they can push it down.
When will that happen? Unknown, but do not bet against it.
If you close your
eyes, the monster
will not go away. 
You lose money and you jump
out the window, too bad. 
It’s your problem. 
Government should realize at
the end of the day it’s investors
who bear responsibility for their
investments.3

In case you’re concerned that this book will create a whole new generation
of trend followers who will negatively affect the frequency, direction, and
intensity of trends (as well as your ability to make money trading trends), for-
get it. Here are reasons why systematic trend following will continue to excel:
• Trend followers follow. They don’t generate trends. At the beginning
or end of a major trend, there may be volatility, but it will be an
extremely superficial, temporary effect.2
• People play zero-sum games for many reasons. Not all play to win.
Hedgers, for example, trade the market for certain reasons. It’s portfo-
lio protection for them. Their insurance premium goes to trend follow-
ing speculators. The hedgers are getting a benefit even when they lose.
• People would no longer buy and hold. Those believing in fundamental
analysis (the vast majority of market participants) would have to switch
how they trade. They would need to cease buy and hold and/or long-
only approaches and start trading as trend followers.
• Most do not “sell short.”
They trade “long only.” That
changes when?
• People would have to dump
mutual funds. That will be
hard with retirement pro-
grams literally mandating 100
percent investments in
mutual funds.
• Most traders don’t think about how much to buy or how much to sell.
They only worry about when to buy and rarely think about when to
sell. That thought process is very hard to break for a mass trend follow-
ing conversion.
• CNBC, WSJ, Bloomberg, etc. would need to end.
• People would have to disengage their emotions and egos from their
trading. However, as long as there are human beings involved in the
trading process, there will be excessive reactions and trends to exploit.
• People would need to stop gambling… They might stop eating too.
Frequently the question is asked, “If trend following works so well, why
aren’t more people doing it?” Acknowledging complete ignorance about the
future is tough to accept, admit, and act on, but that is what trend following
requires you to do.
The Internet is arbitraging away
everything. Man’s greatest
invention is eliminating the
need for people.
How will you adjust?

Black Box
In science and engineering, a black box is a device, system, or object that can
be viewed solely in terms of its input, output, and transfer characteristics
without any knowledge of its internal workings; that is, its implementation is
“opaque”—hence the “black” part.2
David Swensen,
one of the so-called
respected Wall Street guys (he runs the $17 bil-
lion dollar Yale endowment fund), was blunt as
he took a swing at trend traders: “We don’t
invest in quantitative black box models because
we simply don’t know what they are doing.”
How could Swensen not understand a simple
trend following system?
One trend trader countered: “If you are going to give a systems trader
the label ‘black box’ then all those guys predicting the future, at least have
the consistency to call them the crystal ball.”4
Wall Street needs a spin or a narrative to sell, and they all sell similar sto-
ries. Pension funds, family offices, fund of funds, and others who allocate
money, like to herd. These gatekeepers always move in lockstep. They blindly
follow the worst investing schemes, and continually knock sound strategies
such as trend following—with terms like black box.5
Why? So many are motivated by what matters least. Namely, quick
money (the quicker the better) at
whoever’s expense. That’s how
the financial world got so close to
the abyss. Many well-intentioned
people, running retirement pro-
grams with your money, don’t
know they don’t know—and they
are prone to investing in the
wrong things—regularly.
You say this talk is not related
to you? You just have a public
pension fund? Not so fast. From state of Texas employees to state of
California employees to employees at Verizon and GM to investments made
on behalf of police, firemen, and teachers—millions have investments that
touch hedge funds. The question: Is your hedge fund investment properly
using systematic trend following or is it promising Madoff-like returns?
This is a game of
misses. The guy who
misses the best is
going to win.3
Many on Wall Street don’t want
above average returns. Their
objective is to charter the 150
footer, and party like it’s 1999.

during the Grand Prix? 
It’s a Wall Street orgy.6

Lucky Monkey
“It is easy to locate a bunch of trend followers in hindsight, and tout their abil-
ities. What would be harder would be to find the whole universe of people follow-
ing trends, and see how they do as a whole.”
The last man standing: Lucky survivor or skill?
Evaluate George Soros. His trading has always resembled trend trading.
So was Soros just lucky at his trading? Consider this: The probability of
George Soros’s returns coming from randomness is much smaller than
Warren Buffett’s, for example, because Soros did almost everything. Buffett
on the other hand followed a strategy to buy a few companies that had a cer-
tain earnings profile, and it worked for him. There was much more luck
involved in Buffett’s strategy as he made far fewer decisions.2
One reader wrote me: “Suppose we have an infinite number of monkeys
each in front of an infinite number of typewriters. We should not be surprised
if one of these monkeys eventually produces an identical copy of some great
work of fiction. Given the large number of investment products and traders
in the world it is perhaps not surprising that there exists a lucky few who turn
out to have amazing results. I am not saying the individuals who have pro-
duced impressive track records are
not skilled but what I am saying is
that they may not be as skilled as
you think.”
Here is a thought for skeptics:
Assume that only one lonely trend
following trader exists. Just one
guy exists who has literally made
tens of thousands of trades (if not
more) over the course of 40 years
as a systematic trend following
trader. Assume this hypothetical
trend following trader has pro-
duced nearly +20 percent per year on average. Yes, that is a serious number—
especially when compounded.
As you may have guessed—he is real.

To suggest that there is nothing to be learned from trend following per-
formance success across many, many traders, spanning decades, in all types of
markets, both up and down trends, is absurd. The life-changing question for
you: Is there anything to learn from the numerous winning trend following
traders, or do you view them as just lucky monkeys whose darts happened to
hit all bull’s-eyes for decades?
This is the fork in the road for you: luck or skill. The choice will alter
your life.

and is not intent on arriving.1

Honest
Mutual funds, brokers, financial news, big banks, and 23-year-old AP finance
writers fresh out of journalism school, the ones who literally make up the fun-
damental news and predictions daily, have all been a massive sham, wittingly
or unwittingly, and to say that puts a .30-06 bullseye figuratively between my
eyes.
Provoke reactions. Cause some to whine. Yes, that’s what I do. Here are
some friends:
• The [trend following] field is marked by
unsubstantiated claims of success; a track
record of failure and associated rationaliza-
tions; a lack of peer reviewed studies show-
ing any positive results; and a collection of
logical, mathematical and statistical fallacies.
Although there are plenty of technical
traders having success, there is no evidence that they are anything more
than statistical artifact and the hidden use of standard, subjective, fun-
damental analysis. Technical traders fail to realize that the market would
quickly overwhelm any truly successful system, rendering it useless.2
• [Covel’s] book does not say how to be a trend follower, or how the
average person can buy commodities, FX, futures etc., the markets
trend followers use. I hate books that promote stuff, but then don’t
actually tell you anything or how to do it.
• Trend following is one of the stock market’s biggest con; I would even
go so far to compare the concept to a cult like Scientology.
• There were no specifics. No rocks to cling on to. If you want to dis-
cover trend following techniques then look elsewhere.
• [Trend Following] has no substance. Lots of historic data to show trend
following does exist, some people make money doing it, but no more!
It has zero information on how to do it.
• You’ll find in [Covel’s] books a kind of anti-intellectualism shared by
many blind-faith religious people.
• BEWARE: Covel had an agenda when he wrote [The Complete
TurtleTrader].
The Ramones sang,
“There’s no stoppin’
the cretins from
hoppin’.”

• Rather than impartially presenting the evidence, like any good evangeli-
cal sectarian blind-faither, [Covel] pitches the story as one of competi-
tion between two mutually incompatible doctrines.
• Examining only price action is clearly a kind of primitive attempt. The
analogy I think of is in trying to explain the movement of oceanic
water. Examining nothing other than the surface phenomena of price
action is analogous to looking at surface wave movements only—where
the wind explains some part of the movement. Now what might really
be moving bodies of water requires a fundamental model—for example,
how gravity, the moon, ocean floor structure, temperature might
explain the movement of oceanic water mass.
• [Covel’s] documentary [Broke: The New American Dream] does not
address the saps who haven’t been drawn the cards on the table to put
them in the game of risk and luck depicted here. It presumes that mil-
lions of other dwellers beyond the devastated areas have sufficient
income to generate their American Dream. It begs you to have the
mental aptitude of a Houdini. It wants us to believe that life has afford-
able risks if we have the instincts of a poker player; whereas, until the
70s, the American Dream was guaranteed by an education, solid mar-
riage, and sound character. Here, you only require the predatory
instincts of a roving gambler. Welcome to West World, by gummy!
• [Covel], there is no contradiction between being a chartist, an
Elliottician, and a trend follower. I consider myself all of the above, as
well as a fundamentalist.
One of the most useful criti-
cisms that you can use to further
your understanding centers on
prediction. Trend followers, as
shown 
throughout 
Trend
Commandments, do not predict a
market’s timing or direction.
Trend followers react to market
movements. It is critical distinction best seen in the words of trend follower
Bill Dunn:
“We don’t make market predictions. We just ride the bucking
bronco.” 
One critic could not wrap his arms around the idea. He yelled and he
beat his chest in argument for quite a long time. However, you need to judge

whether Bill Dunn, a man with a 35-year performance track record, and who
has made hundreds of millions in profit as a trend following trader, is wrong
with his no prediction wisdom or whether my critic, who works as a massage
therapist, is right with his trend followers do predict wisdom.
However, even after the last decade of market tumult, the media still
push the prediction party line:
“The markets may be rational after all. The threat of severe nuclear
contamination from a breached Japanese nuclear reactor still looms.
The outcome of the escalating war in Libya is uncertain. Yet The
Standard & Poor’s 500 index ended the week up 2.7 percent. The
Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.1 percent. So what happened to
all that headline-driven volatility from two weeks ago? If you look at
historical patterns, this week’s rebound isn’t so surprising. The num-
bers suggest stocks will likely keep rising for the next few months.”3
It is guaranteed that if you think you can forecast the future, you will lose
your shirt betting on those predictions. 
Some will never know and will rip this book as well. A famed Stanford
University psychologist has said that a man with a conviction is a hard man
to change. Tell him you disagree and he turns
away. Show him facts or figures and he questions
your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see
your point. 
Now I could very easily avoid criticism, do
nothing, say nothing, and be nothing, but quit-
ting is not in my DNA. 
However, criticism is important and often
invigorating for many reasons:
• You are on the right track when a target appears on your back.
• Making a sizable dent in public thought brings detractors and sabo-
teurs. It’s part of doing business.4
• Trying to get everyone to like you is mediocrity.5
• You are going to be criticized if you play small or play big. Might as
well play big. Criticism will come either way.6
• History does not remember those who pretend to be neutral. Picking
sides, choosing those you want to be associated with, and sticking with
your true beliefs is all that counts.7
My role is not 
Dr. Phil’s. Some 
critics’ issues might
be best left for their

• Speaking out on issues, that others are too afraid to do, will draw 
criticism.8
• Disgruntled people need to release anger. Standing there as an easy
outlet for their anger is part of the gig. Criticism always parallels 
influence.9
• It takes courage to see things for what they are, not what you want
them to be.
• Poking an inferiority complex brings out vitriol—always.
Society’s insatiable push to discredit those
who rock the boat, coupled with digital printing
presses cataloging it all, has allowed village idiots
and Nobel Prize winners to effectively share the
same stage. In this environment, for many, the truth has ceased to matter.

Under the Radar
My second book, The Complete TurtleTrader, was the true story of a group
of novices who were hired in the early 1980s and trained to be trend follow-
ing traders by one of the legendary traders of all time—Richard Dennis. They
were nicknamed the Turtles. Many of them still trade today and are acknowl-
edged to be some of the best trend traders around. This is actually grounded
in a real-life experiment like in the film Trading Places—taking people off the
street and turning them into millionaires.
There was one TurtleTrader who was impos-
sible to find during my book research process. I
later discovered he was an accomplished guitarist
specializing in acoustic, Klezmer, and Latin
music. Does he still trade? Yes, said one of his fel-
low Turtle traders. That same Turtle told me that
this guitar-teaching-trend-following Turtle has
had the best returns for any Turtle since 1988.
You go to college. You decide to take music
classes studying guitar. Unbeknownst to you,
your teacher is secretly one of the best trend fol-
lowing traders alive today. Crazy world. How many students at San Diego
State would ever know the man playing guitar in the university quad knows
more about trading and making money than the entire business faculty at the
university?

Ethos
The very bright trailblazers who molded my thinking can be seen across these
pearls:
• Bring joyful, imaginative, and impassioned energy every day. 
Don’t fake it.
• You don’t need to be big to be good, you need to be smart.
• When there is no one there, insert yourself. Take over.
• Engage the world as if your life depends on it.
• Nothing is more important than transforming someone.
• Have a vision grounded in your uniqueness.
• The race winner is often curious and slightly mad.
• Dry obligation in life will figuratively kill you.
• No one will give you permission. Seize the mantle.
• If you can’t solve a problem, you are playing by the collective’s rules.
• Hard work, sustained concentration, and drive are the so-called secrets.
• Winners understand sunk costs and opportunity costs.
• Plan to win, prepare to win, and have every right to expect to win.
• It’s in your power to change your belief systems. No one is stuck. Be
unstuck.
These are not easy. Society is not organized
to encourage and celebrate the unproven striver.
It is much safer to beat up the new thought or
heap scorn upon it. Too many young minds are
encouraged to take a safe path. Years ago, this
was solid advice. Today, this is awful advice. It is
shortsighted.2
And for those who complain they were born without a silver spoon, who
think they need more money to start, who say that they were not blessed to
have trend following rules in their early twenties (like the famous
TurtleTraders), money cannot compensate for a lack of talent, for sloth, a
flawed vision, or for a pedestrian frame of mind.3
Here is a great example of not being lodged in a pedestrian way. Michael
Rosenberg of Sports Illustrated was reflecting on Cinderellas Butler and
Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) both advancing to the 2011

NCAA Final Four. If you recall, both these teams had rocky seasons and were
not locks to make the tournament till the very end of their seasons. He noted
that it was a good thing to sprint to the edge of a cliff and stop: 
“If you almost get eliminated, two wonderful things can happen.
One, you know you can handle the pressure, and you don’t worry
about it anymore. And two, you feel like it’s your destiny to win. I
don’t believe in destiny, but I believe in believing in destiny. What I
mean is that a team that believes in its destiny is more likely to win.
We’re all surprised that those guys…are in the Final Four. But they
don’t seem surprised, and maybe that helps explain why they are
[there].”4
Nothing can keep you from winning, if win-
ning is what you really want to do. To think oth-
erwise suggests not just a lack of imagination but
also a failure of the optimism necessary for
attracting good things. No optimism? Throw
this book away immediately.5

Games People Play
You can make your first million—and that is the hard number. Anyone can
do it. Of course, billions, and degrees of billions, require some luck.
However, an educated person, no matter how they get their education, can
indeed saddle up to their iPad and make a small fortune. To say otherwise is
disingenuous.
The world has changed. The
game is different. If you are sitting
around waiting for a job to magi-
cally appear, or if you are listening
to talking heads rambling on
about politicians creating jobs, or
worse yet, you think China is the
enemy to your wealth creation, it
has to be asked: “Are you a
masochist?”
There is another game to play. Trend following trading is that game, but
it is terribly important to avoid becoming the game—a game I have explained
in a multitude of ways. So think about the three
types of players in any game:
• Those who know they are in the game.
• Those who do not know they are in the
game.
• Those who do not know they are in the
game and have become the game.2
Within a half hour of playing any game, if
you do not know the patsy, you are it. Said another way: You are the game.
That is serious talk for the serious game of your financial health and wealth.
It is time to incite the 
conversation. Disrupt the status
quo. Push people off the matrix.
Spark curiosity. 
And do it differently.

People spend so much time listening to someone else feed information. Then
they are judged at how well they regurgitate it back to whomever offered it.
It is almost like a college drinking game—that is, the level of sophistication
involved.
When it comes time to take responsibility for
decision-making, many seem to be waiting for an
order. Or, peeking over their shoulder to see
what others are doing just to ensure they are
doing something similar. Curiosity has been
lobotomized from too many. Freud lamented: “What a distressing contrast
between the radiant intelligence of a child and the feeble mentality of the
average adult.”
Simple childlike curiosity with no agenda except to know—that’s it—is a
precious commodity. Kids have that wide-eyed wonderment when they take
apart their first toy to figure out how it works—and so should you. As sim-
plistic as it sounds, maintaining childlike wonder and enthusiasm keeps your
mental doors open.
A top CEO recently spoke before a Harvard MBA class. One of the stu-
dents asked, “What do I do?” The CEO replied, “Take the rest of the money
you have not spent on tuition and do something else.” If you do not under-
stand his wisdom, fine. If you are curious, though, you will figure it out. That
is the difference.
However, with so many conditioned as lemmings, they have become
scared to death to be curious. They worry that by asking questions they will
be exposed as less than. In truth, by not questioning the world, you always
lose. Still others might not fear the question, but instead fear the answer. It’s
a vicious circle.
Open-ended curiosity lets you take a step back and see everything for
what it is right now. Curiosity is the only reason this book exists. It forced
me to dig deeper. Taking very little at face value has always been my modus
operandi. Do you really think teachers liked it when I raised my hand?
Not clever or gifted, 
just curious.

Challenging accepted norms
has always been my passion.
Unearthing details that some may
have wanted buried has made 
me pretty damn good at navigat-
ing obscure fields unrelated to 
trading—like State and Federal
open records law.
In this small world, one of the
more unlikely people to have
asked me, “How do you go about
unearthing details?” was Mikhail
Gorbachev. The former president
had been told in Russian that my
career involved profiling traders who make the big money, so when an intro-
duction was made, he asked me in Russian through a translator, “What is it
like to write about these traders?” Realizing his time was limited, my response
was short: “Very interesting,” I said. He waited for the translation and asked
back: “It must be difficult to get behind the scenes; how do you do it?” With
a smile, “Oh, I am very good at digging” He laughed. No translation was
needed. He understood my English perfectly.3
Many ask me Gorbachev’s question. 
Followed by: “How do I know I can be a trend follower?”
And followed by: “How do I know you can help me learn?”
My education comes directly from some of the great trend traders of the
last five decades. No hyperbole there, just a fact. However, it did not start
that way. It started while finishing graduate school in London circa 1994. A
book by motivational speaker Anthony Robbins convinced me that getting
close to great traders was a path to pursue. Sounded easy, but how was I
going to do it? One part of Robbins’s book really struck me.
Unlimited Power featured a story about director Steven Spielberg. His
life changed when he took a tour of Universal Studios at the age of 17. The
tour didn’t make it to where all the action was, so Spielberg took his own
action. He sneaked off to watch the filming of a real movie. Later, he ended
up meeting the head of Universal’s editorial department, who expressed an
interest in one of his early films. For most people, that is where the story
would have ended, but Spielberg wasn’t like most. He kept pushing by 
meeting directors, writers, and editors, learning from every conversation,
observing, and developing more and more sensory acuity about what worked
in moviemaking.4

That Spielberg story was all the motivation needed. Example: I once flew
to Berlin, Germany, spending thousands of dollars not in my bank account,
just for the chance to possibly meet and learn from a few traders at a confer-
ence—a conference where no one knew me. My credentials were a nametag
and moxy, but that calculated gamble worked out enough to find myself
spending quality time with a former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
Those conferences allowed face-to-face access to legendary traders—
enough personal contact that even Dustin Hoffman’s character in Rain Man
could see that they put their pants on like everyone else. Attendance at those
conferences triggered my confidence and passion. 
Unfortunately, we have a cul-
ture where that go figure it out atti-
tude is not the norm. In today’s
world, children grow up with soccer
leagues and spelling bees where
everyone gets a prize. On the play-
grounds, dodge ball has been
deemed too traumatic. Some lac-
tose intolerant parents consider
musical chairs dangerously exclu-
sionary. Kids are constantly praised
for routine accomplishments.5
Those kids will never be curious. They will probably end up addicted to
Xanax-Ritalin sprinkled cupcakes so they can cope. Am I being a pessimistic
grouch? Far from it—just describing the playing field and your opponents. 
No one is going to know or

Epilogue
While watching David Duchovny’s Californication and hearing Lynyrd
Skynyrd’s “Free Bird” in the background credits (can’t make that combina-
tion up), my fascination started anew. Adrenaline pumped. That random
stimulation was a reminder that nothing is traditional about my so-called
“Wall Street” research career. Accidental tourist. Yes, that sounds about right.
No formal training. No rulebook. An ordainment by powers that be never
came, nor was it expected.
Trend Commandments started
as a reimagining of my first book.
I wanted to break Trend Following
open and make it more digestible,
less academic. Using my best
pseudo Jay-Z sampling skills, I
have tried to create a unique work
with Trend Commandments built
around timeless principles and a
unique access.
Today, top traders share with me. Practice, hard work, and just pulling
my chair up to the table fixed once-insurmountable access barriers. It has
been a circuitous journey, one step forward, two steps back, four steps for-
ward. One random data point connected to other random data points, in
ways with seemingly no connection.
Not surprisingly, it was a chance meeting with a legend in the trend fol-
lowing world that shifted my gluteus maximus into overdrive. Dateline 2001.
Interestingly, this get-together only happened because my firm had regis-
tered his name as a domain name. Not to cybersquat, but the business tele-
scope looking ahead thought it might lead to a biography web site, but there
was no real plan. When he first e-mailed asking for the domain, the owner-
ship paperwork was signed over and sent along to him for nothing.
A short while later, he reached out. A friendship unfolded. Business ideas
were discussed. At one point, an associate of his approached about acquiring
my firm. The three of us were in on an e-mail conversation discussing
specifics. This new trader friend of mine responded to his associate:
This book is not just my view. 
It is 15 years of osmosis with
great trend following traders. 
It is a behind-the-curtain
treatise.

His message, wit, and sarcasm said clearly it was smarter for me to go it
alone. That e-mail dramatically influenced and reinforced my entrepreneurial
core. Far more than comatose time spent in my
MBA program, his e-mail set in motion the con-

Ten years later, following others or being controlled by others is still not

However, that experience had a recent bookend. After bumping into

about each other through mutual acquaintances,
a particular woman approached me and said sim-

Well, for myself that is an odd question and
not so easy to answer. My mind raced with ways.
Author? “No, more of an entrepreneur.”
“Author doesn’t fit.” The brain starts going back
and forth, and momentarily it was forgotten that
a conversation was still going on with her. She saw the hesitation and fired
with sharp wit, “So you are not sure what you are?”

Surprise, Surprise, Surprise
Earlier in the chapter “Systematic Trend Following,” I included a small
excerpt from CNBC’s Erin Burnett interviewing trend following trader
David Harding a few years back. On April 8, 2011, CNBC anchor Joe
Kernen interviewed Harding as well. At the time of that interview, Harding’s
firm Winton Capital was managing $21 billion dollars in assets for clients via
trend following strategies. Now that you have read Trend Commandments,
consider Kernen’s interview and my questions that follow.
Kernen started the interview reading from a piece of paper that described
Harding as a systematic trend follower who believes scientific research will
succeed in the long run. He wondered out loud if “computers” were used
and asked Harding to describe his trading strategy.2
Harding, on remote from London, responded that his firm “goes with
the flow.” He follows trends and makes money going long on rising markets
and short on declining markets. He mentioned that there had been enough
trends for his firm to make money nearly every year for the last 15 years.3
Kernen pounced, wondering whether he
could blame Harding and other trend followers
for Oil and Gold going higher and “for the pen-
dulum swinging much further than it should on a
fundamental basis.”4 Harding thought there
might be some truth to Kernen’s point, but there
was only so much time to elaborate. Kernen,
under his breath, with a huge wide smile emerg-
ing, interjected at that acknowledgement: “Uh,
yeah.”5
Harding reminded Kernen that his firm was limited by speculative posi-
tion limits set by the government and that his trading size was tiny by com-
parison to major investment banks. Harding went on to further clarify that
he doesn’t trade by a “gut feel.” He added: “We don’t just make it up.” He
also didn’t apologize for his scientific approach to markets, an approach he
defined as “rigorous.”6
The ancients were
known to engage in
reading entrails of
animals to forecast
the future.

Kernen replied with a shot
across the bow bringing up failed
hedge fund Long Term Capital
Management (LTCM). He saw it as
ironic that LTCM folded in the
same year (1997) that Harding’s
firm launched: “I heard science and
I heard you’ve never had a down
year, and it just reminded me of
LTCM.” Kernen talked sarcastically
about the Nobel Prize winners at
LTCM, their “algorithms,” and the
fact that they never had a down year
until their blowup.8
Harding quickly clarified that his firm did have a down year in 2009 and
that his performance success actually went back over two decades—23 years
to be exact. He noted that his first firm AHL (which he sold) was now the
world’s largest managed futures fund. He also addressed LTCM head-on,
stating that the book When Genius Failed (the story of LTCM blowing up)
was “required reading” at his firm.9
Kernen, with condescension, quipped: “I bet it is.” He then went on to
ask Harding if he could provide some of his best “picks.” That question
makes perfect sense for every fundamental trader who thinks he can predict
the future, but it is a ridiculous question to ask a trend following trader.
Harding replied that he could not forecast markets: “I can’t give you best
picks.” He pointed out that his success comes from having a slight edge and
proper betting.10
Kernen, still not about to acknowledge anything positive about trend fol-
lowing, smugly asked if Harding would know when the party was over.
Harding was nonplussed, noting that there has been a long history of suc-
cessful trend following going back 40 years. He also compared 2010-2011’s
great trending markets to another era—the 1970s.11
Kernen, with little journalistic objectivity, shot back that he had heard
those kinds of expressions before: “‘Please let there be another real estate
boom because I spent all the money I made.’ I heard commodities guys say-
ing that for a while [too].” He then wrapped up with standard pleasantries
and one last zinger hoping that Harding could come back again “with the
same moniker [and] same title.”12
Markets are not efficient or
orderly. They are an endless 
battleground. Opposing views
fighting each other to a 
standstill until one side 
eventually prevails and surges
ahead. The emergence of price
trends often reflects the end 
of a battle.7

Before analyzing the interview, consider a definition of critical thinking:
“Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively
and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing,
and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by,
observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as
a guide to belief and action. In its exemplary form, it is based on
universal intellectual values that transcend subject matter divisions:
clarity, accuracy, precision, consistency, relevance, sound evidence,
good reasons, depth, breadth, and fairness.”13
With that in mind, here are some questions to ponder:
1. Is it believable that Joe Kernen, the anchor of CNBC’s longest running
program, had no knowledge and/or comprehension of trend following,
or other descriptions of it such as managed futures or CTAs? If he was
forced to raise his right hand under the threat of perjury, do you think
he would still have such a limited understanding of trend following and
managed futures?
2. When Kernen asked about trend followers purportedly pushing markets
further than they should be fundamentally, did that mean he had a way
to determine the correct price level of all markets at all times?
3. When Kernen brought up Long Term Capital Management in attempt
to compare Harding to its demise, did he not understand that Harding
did not believe in efficient markets? Had he ever looked at a monthly
up and down track record of Harding or any trend follower?
4. Why ask a trend following trader for “picks”?
5. When Kernen asked Harding if he would come back with the same
moniker and title, was he implying that he believed Harding would
blow up soon and be back on CNBC under some reformulated firm
name—like what the proprietors of Long Term Capital Management
did after their blowup? Has he ever asked Warren Buffett that question?
I can easily see some painting this interview differently:
“Harding set himself up for the LTCM tie-in by framing himself as a
computer science shop looking at data and being black box.”
“You have to expect Kernen to kick you. That’s what he does. Just
like you know what you’re going to get from Glenn Beck or Stephen
Colbert.”
“Harding basically says, ‘We are the smartest guys on the planet,
trends work, and we look at a lot of data.’”

Trend Commandments
218
One reader, a reader who runs a fundamental advisory service, wrote me:
“Whether Kernen’s questions were clueless or not is really irrelevant.
He did not argue with Harding on any point, and he gave Harding a
good opportunity (within the time available) to explain how his firm
implements trend following. [Kernen] was an ‘adult in the room.’
I’m thinking that’s the way serious trend followers ought to consider
presenting themselves instead of sarcasm and ‘we don’t predict’ as if
that is an obvious answer to any question.”
The evidence does not bear those criticisms out. There is a deeper game
at play beyond my questions. Joe Kernen is not devoid of academic intelli-
gence. He holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of Colorado in
molecular, cellular, and developmental biology and master’s degree from
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He worked at several investment
banks including Merrill Lynch.
I am no Harding fanboy or
apologist, but I have spent time
with him. That research time, cou-
pled with his public career and
track record, make him one of the
most learned trend trading voices
of the past twenty years. It is clear
to me that Kernen had a prefor-
mulated agenda. His questioning was a transparent attempt to marginalize
Harding and trend following. Why would Kernen do that? Imagine if the
interview started like this: 
“We at CNBC believe in efficient markets and the use of fundamen-
tal analysis. Our business model requires viewers to watch. Today, we
have a guest on who has made billions with trend following trading,
which does not require fundamental analysis or CNBC. Would you
like to know how to make money without ever watching our channel
again? Welcome David Harding!”
A Kernen ego will never debate this subject on neutral grounds, but that
is no surprise. Learn from this interview and the analysis. For those with their
eyes wide open, this is yet another moneymaking confidence builder.

Origins
Stig Ostgaard is a “TurtleTrader”—a trader covered in my second book, The
Complete TurtleTrader. He graciously allowed his history of trend following to
be reprinted in Trend Commandments:
Although trend following has been a popular trading philosophy for
many years, surprisingly little has been written about its origins and history.
This is partly due, no doubt, to the scarcity of available information prior to
the early 20th century, and because until about 50 years ago, trend follow-
ing as a philosophy had not been completely articulated. To be sure, by the
early 1950s, many trend following methodologies were in common use—
and may have been for centuries—but the underlying concept had not been
fully defined, or even given a name.
One reason for this paucity of early information is suggested by the “fol-
lowing” part of the term “trend following.” The implication is one of pas-
sivity, of reaction, rather than of bold, assertive action—and human nature
shows a distinct preference for the latter. Also, trend following appears to be
too simple an idea to be taken seriously. Indeed, simple ideas can take a long
time to be accepted—think of the concept of a negative number, or of zero:
Simple to us, but problematic to ancestors.
But, for whatever reasons, people learn easily from the past only that
which the participants of the time chose to reveal, and above that, what their
chroniclers found interesting enough about which to write. People know the
stories of the “plungers,” the “manipulators,” and their “corners”; of Daniel
Drew, Jay Gould, James A. Patten, and Arthur Cutten; but little of the lesser-
known traders, or “followers,” sitting on the sidelines analyzing the markets,
perhaps more successfully than their legendary contemporaries.
Nevertheless, history is not completely in the dark. There are things to be
revealed by looking back into history.
Let’s deconstruct the subject. Is trend following one thing, or is it many?
Certainly it has—at least today—many manifestations. There are breakout
systems, moving average systems, volatility systems, and many others, all of
which can be considered to be trend following in nature. But these are the
particulars. What are the universals? What is trend following’s basic nature?
As a first attempt at definition, I would suggest that trend following has
two natures. It is at one level a phenomenon of the human psyche, an expres-
sion of the Keynesian “animal spirits” that percolate from the deepest levels

Trend Commandments
222
of man’s being. This type of trend following is spontaneous, inductive, adap-
tive, and evolutionary—a burst of conformity to innovations in the immedi-
ate environment. At this level, the masses have always been trend followers,
not only in financial matters, but also in terms of music, art, clothing, and
basic worldviews. But the other level of trend following is something else
entirely. This is the meta-level, which sits above the tableau of material and
psychological cause and effect, allowing participants to observe the behavior
of the markets as a whole—and to design intelligent, premeditated responses
to market action. This is the level of trend following from which we as traders
should and usually do operate.
Now, although trend following at this meta-level can certainly become
complex, still its essential elements can be simply stated. They are three: 1)
To initiate positions based on the perceived direction of the trend, 2) To hold
positions based on the perceived direction of the trend, and 3) To liquidate
positions based on the perceived direction of the trend
There is also possibly a fourth thing, as suggested above: It is to do all of
these things systematically, on the basis of logical relationships or mathemat-
ical formulations. But I do not think that this is an absolute requirement. It
is certainly possible to be a subjective trend follower, or to combine system-
atic and subjective elements in a trend following system. In fact, I believe that
some great traders did indeed include subjective elements in their method-
ologies. Here, however, I will focus on the systematic aspect.
And here again, the systematic nature of trend following can be simply
stated. Generally (though not invariably), trend following systems look for
their implementation only at the movement of prices. The basic perception is
that if a market’s price is going to make an exceptional move in one direction
or another, it will first make a moderate move in that direction, leading to the
conclusion that if an initiation can be made at that moderate level, the
remaining portion of the trend can be followed for a significant period of
time thereafter and liquidated at a profit. This scenario is not always expected
to be true, of course; but if it is true often enough, and to a significant degree
enough, then it may lead to profitable trading in the long run.
As much as people can associate trend following with human nature, no
one knows who the first trend followers were. But if there is no known begin-
ning, one is created. You can say something about a part of trend following.
Specifically, of the three elements of trend following mentioned above—
initiation, holding, and liquidation—it is the middle part, staying with the
trend, that has had a reasonably long pedigree. A number of the speculators
and plungers of the past, when asked about their trading strategies, said that
they held on to their positions as long as possible, i.e., they stayed with the
trend.

Origins
223
As one example, consider the economist and trader David Ricardo, who
flourished in the London markets from the 1790s until about 1818. A large
trader in Consols (bonds) and stocks, he accumulated a large fortune from
his speculations, which afforded him the leisure to focus on his primary inter-
est in life, economics. Exactly what his methodologies were is not known, but
it is to him that one of the most famous sayings in all of trading history is
attributed: “Cut short your losses; let your profits run on.”1
This is good advice, no doubt—it has survived to the present time and is
expressed often. Still, there is no detail here, no advice on how to cut losses
or how to let profits run on. And while the first part of the maxim says some-
thing about some liquidations, nothing is said about initiations. The ending
part, however, is a clear exposition of a central tenet of trend following phi-
losophy: As long as the trade is going your way, don’t get out.
For another example, move forward a century and west to another con-
tinent. Here is a quotation from the famous grain trader of the Chicago pits,
Arthur W. Cutten: “Most of my success has been due to my hanging on while
my profits mounted. There is the big secret. Do with it what you will.”2
Again, Cutten is saying, “stay with the trend.”
For a third and final example, let us introduce Jesse Livermore, a very
central figure in the history of trend following, about whom more will be said
later. Here is a significant quote from him: “…the big money is not in the
individual fluctuations but in the main movements—that is, not in reading
the tape but in sizing up the entire market and its trend.”3
This last quote is from Edwin Lefèvre’s “Reminiscences of a Stock
Operator,” a series of articles from the Saturday Evening Post in 1922-1923,
reprinted in book form many times. Although the speaker is stated to be
Larry Livingston, it is generally agreed, based on known biographical infor-
mation, that Lefèvre’s interviewee was Jesse Livermore. The quotation, in
turn, is Livermore’s interpretation of an oft-repeated statement made by
“Old Partridge,” a brokerage-house acquaintance of Livermore’s, that “It’s
a bull market, you know.” This advice was given whenever some trader was
tempted to liquidate a winning position too soon and was not always well
regarded. To Livermore, however, the advice finally sank in, yielding the
analysis above, and, it would seem, changing his trading style, if not perma-
nently, at least in his periods of trading well. “Old Partridge,” alas, though
people would like to know a lot more about him, will remain a mystery. How
did he initiate his positions? How did he liquidate? No one will probably ever
know.
Prior to the mid 19th century, speculation seems to have been largely the
province of the elite, and a small coterie of early, but still semi-elite, trend

followers. The larger public’s participation was primarily as trend followers in
the lower sense, taking part in one or another of the “bubbles” that perme-
ated the financial scene from time to time, helping to precipitate the panics
that occurred regularly during the period.
But the next half-century and beyond saw the growth of a much larger
pool of market participants, as well as some fundamental changes in thinking
and procedures. According to William Fowler, in his book Ten Years in Wall
Street (written in 1870), the key year was 1862, “when began the greatest era
of speculation the world has ever seen,” while “Uncle Sam’s presses were
printing greenbacks by the million.”4
To be sure, some price movements in stocks and commodities during this
era were breathtaking: In addition to the grain corners previously mentioned,
there was the “gold pool” of 1869, as well as regular bull runs in numerous
railroad stocks.
The importance of Fowler to knowledge is that he was not just a writer;
he was a participant. He knew the major traders of the day personally and
participated in many of the market movements of the day himself. Finally,
there is an extensive and meaningful narrative concerning speculation and the
workings of the markets during a very formative period.
Significantly, none of these writers records the use of any meaningful sys-
tematic trend following methodology, although Fowler does give an example
of Pat Hearne, who added to his position every time the price of his stock
went up by one percent, and sold out entirely when it went down one 
percent.5
Henry Clews, in Twenty-eight Years, suggests a very primitive form of
trend following, advising young traders to watch the behavior of the old
retired operators who, away from the hustle and bustle and after many, many
years of experience finally imbued with wisdom, leave their homes only a few
times a year to make their appearances on the Street—at times of market
euphoria to sell and in panics to buy. “I say to the young speculators, there-
fore, watch the ominous visits to the Street of these old men.…If you only
wait to see them purchase…you can hardly fail to realize handsome profits on
your ventures.”6
Good advice, perhaps. But the problem was actually greater. Rather than
“old men,” it was the rings and pools that more often began major market
moves. How could one tell when a pool had started buying? Or had begun
selling? These questions had no real fundamental answer, or at least none 
that was accessible to the average small trader in these markets. To be sure,
there were newspapers, but how was one to know the truth of what was
being reported? Even if there was no outright disinformation, surely the big

225
speculators did not telegraph their intents so easily. They rather tried to hide
their buying and selling. So, for the small trader, the question was a techni-
cal one, to be answered by observing who was doing the buying and selling—
to whatever extent that was possible—or by watching the price action of the
stock itself, and the volume. And so I would argue that the technical
approach to trading, including trend following, came about not by design,
but by necessity.
Speculation in the 19th century was, it would appear, rich in practice but
poor in theory. What was needed was an approach that could step back from
the fray, observe the actions of the marketplace from an objective distance,
and contemplate the nature of price fluctuations and swings over the period
of days, months, and years. Were there meaningful patterns hiding in the ebb
and flow of prices? Could knowledge of these patterns be the basis for trad-
ing the markets? Was there a theory that might provide structural, systematic
underpinnings for a true trend following model?
In fact, such a model was being developed, if incompletely, as the cen-
tury was drawing to a close. The model was called Dow Theory, based on
concepts originated by Charles H. Dow in a series of articles in the Wall
Street Journal between 1899 and 1902, expanded upon by William Hamilton
between 1903 and 1929, and refined by Robert Rhea in 1932. Inasmuch as
Dow Theory defines a bull market as a series of higher highs, and a bear mar-
ket as a series of lower lows, the rudiments of a trend following strategy
become apparent: One buys on the breakout of an old high, and sells on the
breakout of an old low. Of course, there are further rules dealing with con-
firmation and volume, but as a bare bones system, the above will suffice (rec-
ognizing, of course, that the methodology can be applied to individual
equities and commodities as well as “averages”).
The Dow Theory is, I believe, the earliest modern expression of an objec-
tive trend following system, inasmuch as it defines precisely—as long as one
can define precisely what constitutes a meaningful high or low—the entry
and exit levels for trend following trades. Further, the methodology can be
generalized and parameterized: Different levels of breakouts can be used,
moving averages of prices can be used, etc. Dow Theory is certainly the
grandfather of trend following methodologies; indeed, one can argue that
subsequent methodologies are mere refinements of it.
Dow Theory itself is not very mathematical; rather, it makes logical
observations about current and past prices to determine the direction of the
market. This innumeracy is not surprising, since the theory was developed
long before the advent of the computer. Nor is it surprising that the earliest
offshoots of Dow Theory continued in this observational, structural mode of
analysis. Robert Prechter, for example, states that R. N. Elliott developed his

226
wave methodology through contemplation of Dow Theory.7 Richard W.
Schabacker, Robert D. Edwards, and John Magee also recognized Dow
Theory as seminal to their thinking, with Edwards and Magee’s book
Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, for example, devoting three chapters to the
subject.
Indeed, Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, first printed in 1948, as well
as its predecessors, Schabacker’s Technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits,
from 1932, and Profits in the Stock Market, by Harold M. Gartley in 1935,
are milestones in the development of trend following methodology. Given
the focus in these books on technical patterns such as flags, pennants, trian-
gles, head-and-shoulders patterns, etc., it may seem peculiar to associate
these books with trend following, but the point behind being able to distin-
guish such patterns is precisely to recognize signals for trend beginnings,
continuations, and ends. To quote from Edwards: “Profits are made by cap-
italizing on up or down trends, by following them until they are reversed.”8
Aha! The terms “trends” and “following” separated by only the space of
a word, suggestive of an underlying trading philosophy supporting the myr-
iad of details.
The second book, by William D. Gann titled Truth of the Stock Tape, first
published in 1923, also emphasizes the trend: “The way to make money is to
determine the trend and then follow it.”9 Indeed, the focus in this book, and
other works of Gann’s that followed, was, in one way or another, to take
trades in the direction of the market’s trend. Perhaps to the surprise of some,
Truth of the Stock Tape is a very conventional work, given Gann’s later repu-
tation for esotericism and astrology.
The third book was Richard D. Wyckoff’s Studies in Tape Reading, pub-
lished in 1910. Significantly, Wyckoff uses the term “follow the trend” (albeit
in a short term, day trading context) when discussing one Jacob Field,
“Prince of the Floor Traders,” but he does not follow through with a philos-
ophy or description.10
A few years later, however, Wyckoff was more decisively on the side of
trend following, actually publishing a newsletter titled the Trend Letter. In a
similar vein, in a later work, Wyckoff uses an interesting metaphor for 
trend following: “A small trader should be a hitch-hiker.”11 But with respect
to using charts as a means for profitably trading the markets, Wyckoff was
skeptical:
“Let anyone who thinks he can make money following a Figure
Chart or any other kind of chart have a friend prepare it, keeping
secret the name of the stock and the period covered. Then put down
on paper a positive set of rules which are to be strictly adhered to, so

Origins
227
that there can be no guesswork. Each situation will then call for a
certain play and no deviation is to be allowed. Cover up with a sheet
of paper all but the beginning of the chart, gradually sliding the
paper to the right as you progress. Record each order and execution
just as if actually trading. Put Rollo Tape down as coppering every
trade and when done send him a check for what you have lost.”12
Of course, the methodology suggested by Wyckoff can now routinely be
done on an iterative basis by computer. Not one, but millions of tests can be
done with a rapidity that would have astonished Wyckoff. But would his
judgment have changed? Possibly, since many years later, Wyckoff was using
charts to draw trendlines, or as he called them, supply lines and demand lines,
depending upon whether these lines connected high or low points.
Let us get back to practice again, and return to Jesse Livermore, who
communicated much about his trading, either through Lefèvre’s articles, or
through a book he wrote himself in 1940, How to Trade in Stocks. The early
Livermore can be considered to have been at least partially a trend follower
inasmuch as he began his trading program in a small way at first, only
“adding to his line” if the market went in his direction, and abandoning it
otherwise (essentially the advice of Dickson Watts in 1891). He was also
apparently a “breakout” trader, at one point describing a stock that was
bouncing back and forth between two price levels, but observing that even-
tually either buying or selling would become stronger, and “the price will
break through the old barrier.”13
This breakout, then, would define the “line of least resistance.” Later, he
says, “Well, when the price line of least resistance is established I follow it.”14
Going forward to 1940 Livermore can more definitely be considered to
have been a trend follower in that, in How to Trade in Stocks, he advocated
the use of specific buy and sell signals based on his analysis of the perceived
trend. At one point, Livermore uses the term “following the trend” directly:
“It may surprise many to know that in my method of trading, when I see by
my records that an upward trend is in progress, I become a buyer as soon as
a stock makes a new high on its movement, after having had a normal reac-
tion. The same applies whenever I take the short side. Why? Because I am fol-
lowing the trend at the time. My records signal me to go ahead!”15
Note that the verb “follow” has become the present participle 
“following”—an important conceptual necessity (though not the final one),
I believe, in solidifying the idea of trend following as a continuing or recur-
ring action.
Central to Livermore’s philosophy was the recording of “pivotal points,”
or intermediate highs and lows. These “pivotal points” were in part the same

Trend Commandments
228
thing as Dow Theory intermediate highs and lows, or Edwards and Magee’s
“basing points.” Initiation and liquidation signals were based on significant
movement away from these pivotal points—either three or six points,
depending upon the type of rally or reaction that was being considered, for
a stock selling above $30. Thus, Livermore’s formula was not a breakout 
system, nor a trendline system, but rather a type of “filter rule,” though a bit
more complicated than the typically tested sort. The parameters used were
arbitrary, but according to Livermore, based on much experience. Today you
can optimize parameters by computer to save time.
Livermore’s method certainly has some appeal, but one cannot help
thinking that it might have been better understood and traded if it were chart
based. But Livermore was not a chartist: “Personally, charts have never
appealed to me. I think they are altogether too confusing.”16
In addition to the work of Edwards, Magee, Livermore, and the others,
the 1930s and 1940s saw several other advances relating to the theory and
evidence for trend following. One of the more interesting studies came from
the Cowles Commission for Economic Research (now the Cowles
Foundation at Yale University) in 1937. Written by Alfred Cowles III
(founder of the institution) and Herbert E. Jones, this study investigated the
probabilities of sequences of rises and falls in stock market prices over several
time horizons, ranging from 20 minutes to seven months. Its conclusion was
that, yes, there was a tendency for the market to continue in the same direc-
tion as the period before. In short, there was serial correlation: At least from
one period to the next, there was trendiness, and some justification for the
use of trading methodologies that might today be called trend following. In
summary, the study states:
“This evidence of structure in stock prices suggests alluring possibili-
ties in the way of forecasting. In fact, many professional speculators,
including in particular exponents of the so-called ‘Dow Theory’
widely publicized by popular financial journals, have adopted systems
based in the main on the principle that it is advantageous to swim
with the tide.”17
Also worthy of note was a 1949 article in Fortune, “Fashions in
Forecasting,” by Alfred Winslow Jones (yes, that Alfred Winslow Jones—
originator of the hedge fund concept and founder of the first hedge fund).
In the article, Jones analyzes many of the then-current stock forecasting tech-
niques, such as Mansfield Mills’ buying and selling curves, Dow Theory, and
other methods having trend following characteristics. His explanation of
trend following revolves around acceptance of “the undoubted fact of
momentum in psychological trends.” The process he describes sounds some-
thing like George Soros’s reflexivity:

Origins
229
“Thus a movement of the stock market once under way generates
unrealistic optimism or pessimism, so that the trend of prices then
carries through and beyond some point of central value. After that,
turned by profit takers or bargain hunters, with the basic forces of
supply and demand altered, the market pendulum starts back and
passes again through and beyond a point of reasonable value, wher-
ever it may be. Therefore, the chances are worth considering that
once a trend has reversed itself to some measured extent (as deter-
mined by the Dow Theory, or by the penetration of a moving aver-
age or trend line), the new trend will continue far enough to make it
worth following.”18
It is notable that Jones uses the exact terms “trend followers” and “trend
following” in his article. But the meaning of the words perhaps differs from
its usage today. For example, when he states that “what Mills and Lowry have
are still trend following tools, with all their advantages and limitations,” he
seems to mean something more like “trend-lagging”—such as when a mov-
ing average turns higher after a trend has already begun. In other words,
trend following was not yet a fully formed concept. “Trend” was not yet a
noun adjunct, nor “following” a gerund.
The individual who finally made the connection was perhaps William
Dunnigan, a trader, technical analyst, and writer who ran a business cycle
forecasting company in Palo Alto, California, in the 1950s. Dunnigan had
many books and other publications to his credit, beginning with the aca-
demic Forecasting the Monthly Movement of Stock Prices in 1930, and follow-
ing with a more technically oriented, mimeographed publication called
“Trading With the Trend” in 1934, to name two. His major works, however,
came out in the early and mid 1950s.
Dunnigan is perhaps best known today for his “thrust” methodologies
and “one way” system; but his overall market perceptions were broad and
deep. He had a knack for verbal innovation, including the invention of terms
such as “trap forecasting” and “continuous forecasting,” used to distinguish
between those trades designed to capture quick profits (“catching the mar-
ket in a trap”) and those with an indefinite duration whose exit levels were
determined on a day-to-day basis, depending on market action. Starting with
these perceptions, the transition to “trend following” is not an arduous one,
for if a market is “trapped” into a directional commitment at the point of,
say, a breakout (i.e., it generates a “signal”), then “continuous forecasting”
takes over until the next “trap” (to liquidate or perhaps reverse) is signaled.
But, if that is the model, then is the “forecasting” part of the formulation
really necessary? Is not the process rather one of monitoring the market for
the occurrence of the next “trap,” and then, when it occurs, acting upon it?

Trend Commandments
230
Ultimately, in his 1954 work New Blueprints for Gains in Stocks and Grains,
that is what Dunnigan concluded, giving us some of the earliest articulated
insights into the philosophy behind trend following:
“We think that forecasting should be thought of in the light of
measuring the direction of today’s trend and then turning to the
Law of Inertia (momentum) for assurance that probabilities favor the
continuation of that trend for an unknown period of time into the
future. This is trend following, and it does not require us to don the
garment of the mystic and look into the crystal balls of the future.”19
And again:
“Let us believe that it is possible to profit through economic changes
by following today’s trend, as it is revealed statistically day-by-day,
week-by-week, or month-by-month. In doing this we should enter-
tain no preconceived notions as to whether business is going to
boom or bust, or whether the Dow-Jones Industrial Average is
going to 500 or 50. We will merely chart our course and steer our
ship in the direction of the prevailing wind. When the economic
weather changes, we will change our course with it and will not try
to forecast the future time or place at which the wind will change.”20
William Dunnigan today remains an underrated trading researcher,
although he was highly, if not widely, regarded in his day, even by academic
economists. Elmer Clark Bratt, for example, refers to Dunnigan’s “trading
with the trend” in his Business Cycles and Forecasting, one of the premier eco-
nomics textbooks of his day:
“Intermediate movements in the stock market do not last any stated
length of time, so we never know just when a rally or a reaction will
take place. What has been called “trading with the trend” by
Dunnigan appears to be the only important forecasting principle
which can be derived.”21
Next in line among the pioneers of trend following was the much better
known Richard Donchian, whose article “Trend-Following Methods in
Commodity Price Analysis” appeared in the Commodity Yearbook of 1957.
Donchian’s article was written in a confident, matter-of-fact manner suggest-
ing that he had a long, intimate knowledge of the principles about which he
wrote, particularly the use of moving averages and “swing trading,” both
developed in the article as examples of trend following methodology. Like
Dunnigan, Donchian discussed more than just the trading systems them-
selves; he also discussed the philosophy behind them. The comments he
made about trend following still hold true:

Origins
231
“Every good trend-following method should automatically limit the
loss on any position, long or short, without limiting the gain.
Whenever a trend, once established, reverses quickly, there is always
a point, not far above or below the extreme reached prior to the
reversal, at which evidence of a trend in the opposite direction is
given. At that point any position held in the direction of the original
trend should be reversed—or at least closed out—at a limited loss.
Profits are not limited because whenever a trend, once established,
continues in a sustained fashion without giving any evidence of trend
reversal, the trend-following principle requires that a market position
be maintained as long as the trend continues.”22
Richard Donchian, as most traders are aware, did much more than write
about trend following. He was also a broker, analyst, and trader, who most
significantly was the founder of the first publicly managed futures fund, the
moving average–based Futures, Inc., in 1948.23
Starting in 1960, he began writing a weekly commodity “Trend Timing”
letter, based on one of his better-known trend following systems, the 5-20
moving average method, thereby creating a documented decades-long per-
formance record for his trading methodology. Further, Donchian was an
innovator in advancing an idea that is now the norm among large futures
trading entities everywhere—the concept of trading many markets at the
same time in a portfolio:
“When I first got into commodities, no one was interested in a
diversified approach. There were cocoa men, cotton men, grain
men…they were worlds apart. I was almost the first one who
decided to look at all commodities together. Nobody before had
looked at the whole picture and had taken a diversified position with
the idea of cutting losses short and going with a trend.”24
And so with Dunnigan and Donchian the story comes to an end.
Although these two were by no means the first trend followers, nor surely the
last, they were truly a watershed in the history of trend following. While
many of the ideas that preceded theirs were trend following in nature, they
were largely inchoate, with an unstated or incomplete underlying philosophy.
Dunnigan and Donchian, however, articulated this philosophy—indeed,
called it trend following—and thereby laid a foundation upon which later
methodologies could comfortably rest. The narrative continues, of course,
but since it has already been well and amply covered, I will stop at this point.
Suffice it to say, however, that everyone remains under the influence of these
pioneers of trend following, whether people know it or not.

I live and breathe my research firm. Reaching and teaching people my
lessons is rewarding. Take advantage of my work, and you will either make or
save a great deal of money. For your associates, friends, and family—some
bullet point ways to describe and explain systematic trend following trading:
• Profit in up and down markets: Trend following doesn’t swear an
allegiance to a bull or bear market. It follows trends to the end. No
matter how ridiculous trends might appear early and no matter how
insanely extended they might appear at the end, follow trends. Why?
They always go farther than anyone expects. Ignore momentum at 
your peril.
• No more buy and hold, analysts, or news: Trend following decision-
making doesn’t involve discretion, guesses, gut feelings, or hunches.
It’s not day trading or buy and hope. It doesn’t involve passive index-
ing, in and out trading, or fundamental analysis. No more 24-hour
news cycles, daily turbulence, or sensational hype. No black boxes or
magic formulas either. Let go of the Holy Grails.
• No prediction: Trends exist everywhere, always coming and always
going. Markets are no different: They trend up and down. That said,
no one can predict a market trend, you can only react to one. Trend
following never anticipates the beginning or end of a trend. It only 
acts when the trend changes. There is no need to figure out why a mar-
ket is trending, just follow it. You don’t need to understand electricity
to use it.
• The big money of letting profits run: Trend following at its best
aims to compound absolute returns. It doesn’t shoot for average. The
goal is to make the knock your socks off returns, not passbook savings
interest. Trend following also has the unique ability to lie and wait for
targets of opportunity. That means making a killing on unpredictable
surprises.

Trend Commandments
236
• Risk management is top priority: Trend following always has defined
exit protocols to control injury to your account. Stop losses and proper
leverage usage are standard practice. Trend following also has low to
negative correlations with most other investment opportunities.
• Takes advantage of mass psychology: Trend following takes advan-
tage of panicky sheep behavior. Strict discipline minimizes behavioral
biases. It solves the eagerness to realize gains and reluctance to crystal-
lize losses. Too many people believe what pleases them. Most behaviors
are simply driven by the impulsive moment of now. Trend following
wins because of that.
• Scientific approach to trading: Trend following doesn’t require a
belief, but rather it relies on unwavering scientific principles. It has a
defined edge just like the MIT card-counting team that beat Vegas casi-
nos. Be the casino, not the hapless player. Trend following uses rigid
rules rooted in numbers. Think process not outcome. Remember, fre-
quency of correctness is not the issue, the magnitude of correctness
matters. Winning percentage means zilch.
• Strong historical performance in crisis periods: Trend following is
adaptable to differing climates and environments performing best dur-
ing periods of rising volatility and uncertainty. The unknown will hap-
pen again. Are you ready? You have to be able to ride the bucking
bronco. Ride out the storm and stay alive.
• No traditional diversification: Trend following is not restricted to any
single market or instrument. A focus on price action allows trend fol-
lowing to be applied to an exceptionally large variety of markets. Price
is the one thing that all markets have in common. A trend trading sys-
tem for Treasury Bonds should also work on the Euro and stocks.
Trend following is robust.
•
No government reliance: Forget Social
Security, bailouts, stimulus plans, and roads
to nowhere. Those won’t help you to make
money; they only help you lose. When the
Fed puts on or takes off the training wheels
(read: rate manipulation), will you be ready
to mint cash or will you sit there and just
take it again? If your portfolio is grounded
in sound principles, you can win no matter
what happens.

Q. Do you expect to make money in
both good markets and bad?
A. There are not good 
or bad markets.
There are up or down markets.

Quick Commandments
The great trend following traders have been moti-
vated by possibility and opportunity, unlike crowds
of panicky sheep unwilling or unable to leave the
herd. Great trend traders seek options, experiences,
choices, and paths. They never quit or allow them-
selves to be muddled by the latest fashion.
In that spirit, these are some of my favorite money-making gems pulled
from the historical wisdom of trend trading pioneers Richard Donchian,
William Dunnigan, Amos Hostetter, Jesse Livermore, Roy Longstreet, and
Dickson Watts:
• Don’t fight the tape!
• Like sharp instruments and strong spirits, leverage confers many bene-
fits, but only when used with care.
• Limit losses and ride profits, irrespective of all other rules.
• Of all the speculative blunders, there are few greater than trying to
average a losing game.
• Always sell what shows you a loss and keep what shows you a profit.
• You can’t force a market into giving you something it doesn’t have to
give.
• Talk is cheap and rumors are even cheaper.
• Courage in a speculator is merely the confidence to act on the decision
of his mind.
• A loss never bothers me after I take it. But being wrong, not taking the
loss, that is what does the damage to the pocketbook and to the soul.
• The trend is evident to a man who has an open mind and reasonably
clear sight.
• In a narrow market, when price moves within a narrow range, the thing
to do is to watch the market, read the tape to determine the limits of
prices, and make up your mind that you will not take an interest until
the price breaks through the limit in either direction.
• Watch the market with one objective: to determine the direction of
price tendency.
• Prices, like everything else, move along the line of least resistance.
Teach us to care and
not to care. Teach
us to sit still.1

Trend Commandments

• It cost me a million dollars to learn that the dangerous enemy to a
trader is the susceptibility to the urging of magnetic personality com-
bined with a brilliant mind. 
• Have a profit? Forget it. Have a loss? Forget it even quicker.
• It was never my thinking that made the big money for me. It was my
sitting, my sitting tight.
• There is only one side to the stock market and it is not the bull side or
the bear side, but the right side.
• If you don’t know what’s going on, don’t do anything.
• Markets are never wrong, opinions often are.
• Don’t be too curious about the reasons behind moves.
• The smarter you are, the longer it takes.
• When time is up, markets will reverse.
• Don’t expect the tape to be a lecturer. It’s enough to see that some-
thing is wrong.
• Don’t imagine that a market that once sold at 150 is cheap at 130.
• A man does not swear eternal allegiance to either the bear or bull side.
• People believe what it pleases them to believe.
• Trend followers plan when they will get out before they ever get in.
• Know every day what your portfolio is worth.
• Calculate what your risks are on any given day for all positions.
• Controlling risk is not the same thing as avoiding risk. If managing risk
is an integral part of your philosophy, when your risk level goes up or
down, you simply adjust.
• Buy market strength and sell market weakness.
• Keep a positive attitude, no matter how much you lose.
• Don’t take the market home.
• Dream big dreams and think tall. Very few people set goals too high. A
man becomes what he thinks about all day long.
• In the world of money, in a world shaped by human behavior, nobody
has the foggiest notion of what will happen in the future. Mark that
word. Nobody.
• When the ship starts to sink, don’t pray…jump!
• Assimilate into your very bones a set of trading rules that works for you.
• Thou shall not trade against the trend up or down.
• There is nothing new on Wall Street. There can’t be, because specula-
tion is as old as the hills.

Quick Commandments
241
• Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and
will happen again.
• Sell when you can, not when you have to.
• An ability to shift on a dime is critical when shifting time comes.
• A common deception—self-deception.
• Fools try to prove that they are right. Wise men try to find when they
are wrong.
• All see; few observe, fewer still compare.
• The foolishness of the many is the opportunity of the few.
• The man who conforms never transforms.
• When you begin to doubt, begin to get out.
• Make believe is a game society plays as well as children.
• Some men are alive after they are dead; others are dead while still alive.
• It’s not about how much can you make, but how much can you lose.
• The unpardonable sin—not to make money.
Lastly, consider William Worthington Fowler’s wisdom circa 1870: “To
the merchant and banker, it is a financial centre, collecting and distributing
money, regulating the exchanges of a continent and striking balances of trade
with London and Frankfort. To the outside observer and novice, it is a kind
of work-shop thronged by cunning artisans who work in precious metals,
where vessels of gold and silver are wrought or made to shine with fresh lus-
ter, and where old china is fire-gilt as good as new. The moralist and philoso-
pher look upon it as a gambling-den, a cage of unclean birds, an abomination
where men drive a horrible trade, fattening and battening on the substance
of their friends and neighbors—or perhaps a kind of modern coliseum where
gladiatorial combats are joined, and bulls, bears, and other ferocious beasts
gore and tear each other for public amusement. The brokers regard it as a
place of business where, in mercantile parlance, they may ply a legitimate
trade, buying and selling for others on commis-
sion. To the speculators, it is a caravansera where
they may load or unload their camels and drive
them away betimes to some pleasant oasis. To the
financial commanders it is an arsenal in which
their arms and chariots are stored, the stronghold
to be defended or besieged, the field for strategy,
battles and plunder.”
